They had both, from childhood\r\nupward, been close and dear friends at the same school. They were now\r\nparting for the first time--and parting, it might be, for life.\r\n\r\nThe name of one was Blanche. The name of the other was Anne.\r\n\r\nBoth were the children of poor parents, both had been pupil-teachers at\r\nthe school; and both were destined to earn their own bread. Personally\r\nspeaking, and socially speaking, these were the only points of\r\nresemblance between them.\r\n\r\nBlanche was passably attractive and passably intelligent, and no more.\r\nAnne was rarely beautiful and rarely endowed. Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s parents\r\nwere worthy people, whose first consideration was to secure, at any\r\nsacrifice, the future well-being of their child. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s parents were\r\nheartless and depraved. Their one idea, in connection with their\r\ndaughter, was to speculate on her beauty, and to turn her abilities to\r\nprofitable account.\r\n\r\nThe girls were starting in life under widely different conditions.\r\nBlanche was going to India, to be governess in the household of a Judge,\r\nunder care of the Judge\xe2\x80\x99s wife. Anne was to wait at home until the\r\nfirst opportunity offered of sending her cheaply to Milan. There, among\r\nstrangers, she was to be perfected in the actress\xe2\x80\x99s and the singer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nart; then to return to England, and make the fortune of her family on\r\nthe lyric stage.\r\n\r\nSuch were the prospects of the two as they sat together in the cabin of\r\nthe Indiaman locked fast in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and crying bitterly.\r\nThe whispered farewell talk exchanged between them--exaggerated and\r\nimpulsive as girls\xe2\x80\x99 talk is apt to be--came honestly, in each case,\r\nstraight from the heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlanche! you may be married in India. Make your husband bring you back\r\nto England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne! you may take a dislike to the stage. Come out to India if you\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn England or out of England, married or not married, we will meet,\r\ndarling--if it\xe2\x80\x99s years hence--with all the old love between us; friends\r\nwho help each other, sisters who trust each other, for life! Vow it,\r\nBlanche!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI vow it, Anne!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all your heart and soul?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart and soul!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sails were spread to the wind, and the ship began to move in the\r\nwater. It was necessary to appeal to the captain\xe2\x80\x99s authority before the\r\ngirls could be parted. The captain interfered gently and firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cCome,\r\nmy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, putting his arm round Anne; \xe2\x80\x9cyou won\xe2\x80\x99t mind _me!_\r\nI have got a daughter of my own.\xe2\x80\x9d Anne\xe2\x80\x99s head fell on the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder. He put her, with his own hands, into the shore-boat alongside.\r\nIn five minutes more the ship had gathered way; the boat was at the\r\nlanding-stage--and the girls had seen the last of each other for many a\r\nlong year to come.\r\n\r\nThis was in the summer of eighteen hundred and thirty-one.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four years later--in the summer of eighteen hundred and\r\nfifty-five--there was a villa at Hampstead to be let, furnished.\r\n\r\nThe house was still occupied by the persons who desired to let it. On\r\nthe evening on which this scene opens a lady and two gentlemen were\r\nseated at the dinner-table. The lady had reached the mature age of\r\nforty-two. She was still a rarely beautiful woman. Her husband, some\r\nyears younger than herself, faced her at the table, sitting silent and\r\nconstrained, and never, even by accident, looking at his wife. The third\r\nperson was a guest. The husband\xe2\x80\x99s name was Vanborough. The guest\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nwas Kendrew.\r\n\r\nIt was the end of the dinner. The fruit and the wine were on the table.\r\nMr. Vanborough pushed the bottles in silence to Mr. Kendrew. The lady of\r\nthe house looked round at the servant who was waiting, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cTell\r\nthe children to come in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and a girl twelve years old entered, lending by the\r\nhand a younger girl of five. They were both prettily dressed in white,\r\nwith sashes of the same shade of light blue. But there was no family\r\nresemblance between them. The elder girl was frail and delicate, with a\r\npale, sensitive face. The younger was light and florid, with round red\r\ncheeks and bright, saucy eyes--a charming little picture of happiness\r\nand health.\r\n\r\nMr. Kendrew looked inquiringly at the youngest of the two girls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is a young lady,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwho is a total stranger to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had not been a total stranger yourself for a whole year past,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n answered Mrs. Vanborough, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would never have made that confession.\r\nThis is little Blanche--the only child of the dearest friend I have.\r\nWhen Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s mother and I last saw each other we were two poor\r\nschool-girls beginning the world. My friend went to India, and married\r\nthere late in life. You may have heard of her husband--the famous Indian\r\nofficer, Sir Thomas Lundie? Yes: \xe2\x80\x98the rich Sir Thomas,\xe2\x80\x99 as you call him.\r\nLady Lundie is now on her way back to England, for the first time since\r\nshe left it--I am afraid to say how many years since. I expected her\r\nyesterday; I expect her to-day--she may come at any moment. We exchanged\r\npromises to meet, in the ship that took her to India--\xe2\x80\x98vows\xe2\x80\x99 we called\r\nthem in the dear old times. Imagine how changed we shall find each other\r\nwhen we _do_ meet again at last!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the mean time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Kendrew, \xe2\x80\x9cyour friend appears to have sent\r\nyou her little daughter to represent her? It\xe2\x80\x99s a long journey for so\r\nyoung a traveler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA journey ordered by the doctors in India a year since,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Mrs.\r\nVanborough. \xe2\x80\x9cThey said Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s health required English air. Sir Thomas\r\nwas ill at the time, and his wife couldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave him. She had to send\r\nthe child to England, and who should she send her to but me? Look at her\r\nnow, and say if the English air hasn\xe2\x80\x99t agreed with her! We two mothers,\r\nMr. Kendrew, seem literally to live again in our children. I have an\r\nonly child. My friend has an only child. My daughter is little Anne--as\r\n_I_ was. My friend\xe2\x80\x99s daughter is little Blanche--as _she_ was. And, to\r\ncrown it all, those two girls have taken the same fancy to each other\r\nwhich we took to each other in the by-gone days at school. One has often\r\nheard of hereditary hatred. Is there such a thing as hereditary love as\r\nwell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore the guest could answer, his attention was claimed by the master\r\nof the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKendrew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Vanborough, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you have had enough of domestic\r\nsentiment, suppose you take a glass of wine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe words were spoken with undisguised contempt of tone and manner.\r\nMrs. Vanborough\xe2\x80\x99s color rose. She waited, and controlled the momentary\r\nirritation. When she spoke to her husband it was evidently with a wish\r\nto soothe and conciliate him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid, my dear, you are not well this evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be better when those children have done clattering with their\r\nknives and forks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girls were peeling fruit. The younger one went on. The elder\r\nstopped, and looked at her mother. Mrs. Vanborough beckoned to Blanche\r\nto come to her, and pointed toward the French window opening to the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to eat your fruit in the garden, Blanche?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche, \xe2\x80\x9cif Anne will go with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne rose at once, and the two girls went away together into the garden,\r\nhand in hand. On their departure Mr. Kendrew wisely started a new\r\nsubject. He referred to the letting of the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe loss of the garden will be a sad loss to those two young ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt really seems to be a pity that you should be giving up this\r\npretty place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeaving the house is not the worst of the sacrifice,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs.\r\nVanborough. \xe2\x80\x9cIf John finds Hampstead too far for him from London,\r\nof course we must move. The only hardship that I complain of is the\r\nhardship of having the house to let.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Vanborough looked across the table, as ungraciously as possible, at\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have _you_ to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanborough tried to clear the conjugal horizon b y a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear John,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gently, \xe2\x80\x9cyou forget that, while you are at\r\nbusiness, I am here all day. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help seeing the people who come to\r\nlook at the house. Such people!\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, turning to Mr. Kendrew.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey distrust every thing, from the scraper at the door to the chimneys\r\non the roof. They force their way in at all hours. They ask all sorts\r\nof impudent questions--and they show you plainly that they don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to\r\nbelieve your answers, before you have time to make them. Some wretch\r\nof a woman says, \xe2\x80\x98Do you think the drains are right?\xe2\x80\x99--and sniffs\r\nsuspiciously, before I can say Yes. Some brute of a man asks, \xe2\x80\x98Are you\r\nquite sure this house is solidly built, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x99--and jumps on the floor\r\nat the full stretch of his legs, without waiting for me to reply. Nobody\r\nbelieves in our gravel soil and our south aspect. Nobody wants any of\r\nour improvements. The moment they hear of John\xe2\x80\x99s Artesian well, they\r\nlook as if they never drank water. And, if they happen to pass my\r\npoultry-yard, they instantly lose all appreciation of the merits of a\r\nfresh egg!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Kendrew laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been through it all in my time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe people who want to take a house are the born enemies of the people\r\nwho want to let a house. Odd--isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, Vanborough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Vanborough\xe2\x80\x99s sullen humor resisted his friend as obstinately as it\r\nhad resisted his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t listening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time the tone was almost brutal. Mrs. Vanborough looked at her\r\nhusband with unconcealed surprise and distress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat _can_ be the matter with you? Are you in pain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man may be anxious and worried, I suppose, without being actually in\r\npain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to hear you are worried. Is it business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsult Mr. Kendrew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am waiting to consult him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanborough rose immediately. \xe2\x80\x9cRing, dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you\r\nwant coffee.\xe2\x80\x9d As she passed her husband she stopped and laid her hand\r\ntenderly on his forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could smooth out that frown!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwhispered. Mr. Vanborough impatiently shook his head. Mrs. Vanborough\r\nsighed as she turned to the door. Her husband called to her before she\r\ncould leave the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind we are not interrupted!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do my best, John.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at Mr. Kendrew, holding the door\r\nopen for her; and resumed, with an effort, her former lightness of tone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t forget our \xe2\x80\x98born enemies!\xe2\x80\x99 Somebody may come, even at this\r\nhour of the evening, who wants to see the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen were left alone over their wine. There was a strong\r\npersonal contrast between them. Mr. Vanborough was tall and dark--a\r\ndashing, handsome man; with an energy in his face which all the world\r\nsaw; with an inbred falseness under it which only a special observer\r\ncould detect. Mr. Kendrew was short and light--slow and awkward in\r\nmanner, except when something happened to rouse him. Looking in _his_\r\nface, the world saw an ugly and undemonstrative little man. The special\r\nobserver, penetrating under the surface, found a fine nature beneath,\r\nresting on a steady foundation of honor and truth.\r\n\r\nMr. Vanborough opened the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you ever marry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be such a fool, Kendrew, as I have\r\nbeen. Don\xe2\x80\x99t take a wife from the stage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could get such a wife as yours,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other, \xe2\x80\x9cI would take\r\nher from the stage to-morrow. A beautiful woman, a clever woman, a woman\r\nof unblemished character, and a woman who truly loves you. Man alive!\r\nwhat do you want more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want a great deal more. I want a woman highly connected and highly\r\nbred--a woman who can receive the best society in England, and open her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s way to a position in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA position in the world!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Kendrew. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is a man whose\r\nfather has left him half a million of money--with the one condition\r\nannexed to it of taking his father\xe2\x80\x99s place at the head of one of the\r\ngreatest mercantile houses in England. And he talks about a position,\r\nas if he was a junior clerk in his own office! What on earth does your\r\nambition see, beyond what your ambition has already got?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Vanborough finished his glass of wine, and looked his friend\r\nsteadily in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy ambition,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9csees a Parliamentary career, with a Peerage at\r\nthe end of it--and with no obstacle in the way but my estimable wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Kendrew lifted his hand warningly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk in that way,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re joking--it\xe2\x80\x99s a joke I don\xe2\x80\x99t see. If you\xe2\x80\x99re in\r\nearnest--you force a suspicion on me which I would rather not feel. Let\r\nus change the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! Let us have it out at once. What do you suspect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suspect you are getting tired of your wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is forty-two, and I am thirty-five; and I have been married to her\r\nfor thirteen years. You know all that--and you only suspect I am tired\r\nof her. Bless your innocence! Have you any thing more to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you force me to it, I take the freedom of an old friend, and I say\r\nyou are not treating her fairly. It\xe2\x80\x99s nearly two years since you broke\r\nup your establishment abroad, and came to England on your father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath. With the exception of myself, and one or two other friends of\r\nformer days, you have presented your wife to nobody. Your new position\r\nhas smoothed the way for you into the best society. You never take your\r\nwife with you. You go out as if you were a single man. I have reason to\r\nknow that you are actually believed to be a single man, among these\r\nnew acquaintances of yours, in more than one quarter. Forgive me for\r\nspeaking my mind bluntly--I say what I think. It\xe2\x80\x99s unworthy of you to\r\nkeep your wife buried here, as if you were ashamed of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _am_ ashamed of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVanborough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a little! you are not to have it all your own way, my good fellow.\r\nWhat are the facts? Thirteen years ago I fell in love with a handsome\r\npublic singer, and married her. My father was angry with me; and I had\r\nto go and live with her abroad. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, abroad. My father\r\nforgave me on his death-bed, and I had to bring her home again. It does\r\nmatter, at home. I find myself, with a great career opening before me,\r\ntied to a woman whose relations are (as you well know) the lowest of\r\nthe low. A woman without the slightest distinction of manner, or the\r\nslightest aspiration beyond her nursery and her kitchen, her piano\r\nand her books. Is _that_ a wife who can help me to make my place in\r\nsociety?--who can smooth my way through social obstacles and political\r\nobstacles, to the House of Lords? By Jupiter! if ever there was a woman\r\nto be \xe2\x80\x98buried\xe2\x80\x99 (as you call it), that woman is my wife. And, what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmore, if you want the truth, it\xe2\x80\x99s because I _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ bury her here that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave this house. She has got a cursed knack of making\r\nacquaintances wherever she goes. She\xe2\x80\x99ll have a circle of friends\r\nabout her if I leave her in this neighborhood much longer. Friends\r\nwho remember her as the famous opera-singer. Friends who will see her\r\nswindling scoundrel of a father (when my back is turned) coming drunk to\r\nthe door to borrow money of her! I tell you, my marriage has wrecked\r\nmy prospects. It\xe2\x80\x99s no use talking to me of my wife\xe2\x80\x99s virtues. She is a\r\nmillstone round my neck, with all her virtues. If I had not been a born\r\nidiot I should have waited, and married a woman who would have been of\r\nsome use to me; a woman with high connections--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Kendrew touched his host\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and suddenly interrupted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo come to the point,\xe2\x80\x9d he said--\xe2\x80\x9ca woman like Lady Jane Parnell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Vanborough started. His eyes fell, for the first time, before the\r\neyes of his friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you know about Lady Jane?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t move in Lady Jane\xe2\x80\x99s world--but I do go sometimes to\r\nthe opera. I saw you with her last night in her box; and I heard what\r\nwas said in the stalls near me. You were openly spoken of as the favored\r\nman who was singled out from the rest by Lady Jane. Imagine what would\r\nhappen if your wife heard that! You are wrong, Vanborough--you are in\r\nevery way wrong. You alarm, you distress, you disappoint me. I never\r\nsought this explanation--but now it has come, I won\xe2\x80\x99t shrink from it.\r\nReconsider your conduct; reconsider what you have said to me--or you\r\ncount me no longer among your friends. No! I want no farther talk about\r\nit now. We are both getting hot--we may end in saying what had better\r\nhave been left unsaid. Once more, let us change the subject. You wrote\r\nme word that you wanted me here to-day, because you needed my advice on\r\na matter of some importance. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSilence followed that question. Mr. Vanborough\xe2\x80\x99s face betrayed signs of\r\nembarrassment. He poured himself out another glass of wine, and drank it\r\nat a draught before he replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not so easy to tell you what I want,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cafter the tone you\r\nhave taken with me about my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Kendrew looked surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Mrs. Vanborough concerned in the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes she know about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you kept the thing a secret out of regard for _her?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I any right to advise on it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have the right of an old friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, why not tell me frankly what it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another moment of embarrassment on Mr. Vanborough\xe2\x80\x99s part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will come better,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom a third person, whom I expect\r\nhere every minute. He is in possession of all the facts--and he is\r\nbetter able to state them than I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is the person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend, Delamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour lawyer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--the junior partner in the firm of Delamayn, Hawke, and Delamayn.\r\nDo you know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am acquainted with him. His wife\xe2\x80\x99s family were friends of mine before\r\nhe married. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re rather hard to please to-day! Delamayn is a rising man, if ever\r\nthere was one yet. A man with a career before him, and with courage\r\nenough to pursue it. He is going to leave the Firm, and try his luck at\r\nthe Bar. Every body says he will do great things. What\xe2\x80\x99s your objection\r\nto him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no objection whatever. We meet with people occasionally whom\r\nwe dislike without knowing why. Without knowing why, I dislike Mr.\r\nDelamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever you do you must put up with him this evening. He will be here\r\ndirectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was there at that moment. The servant opened the door, and\r\nannounced--\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Delamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nExternally speaking, the rising solicitor, who was going to try his\r\nluck at the Bar, looked like a man who was going to succeed. His hard,\r\nhairless face, his watchful gray eyes, his thin, resolute lips, said\r\nplainly, in so many words, \xe2\x80\x9cI mean to get on in the world; and, if\r\nyou are in my way, I mean to get on at your expense.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Delamayn was\r\nhabitually polite to every body--but he had never been known to say one\r\nunnecessary word to his dearest friend. A man of rare ability; a man of\r\nunblemished honor (as the code of the world goes); but not a man to be\r\ntaken familiarly by the hand. You would never have borrowed money\r\nof him--but you would have trusted him with untold gold. Involved in\r\nprivate and personal troubles, you would have hesitated at asking him\r\nto help you. Involved in public and producible troubles, you would have\r\nsaid, Here is my man. Sure to push his way--nobody could look at him and\r\ndoubt it--sure to push his way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKendrew is an old friend of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Vanborough, addressing\r\nhimself to the lawyer. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever you have to say to _me_ you may say\r\nbefore _him._ Will you have some wine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you brought any news?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got the written opinions of the two barristers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Because nothing of the sort is necessary. If the facts of the case are\r\ncorrectly stated there is not the slightest doubt about the law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that reply Mr. Delamayn took a written paper from his pocket, and\r\nspread it out on the table before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Vanborough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe case relating to your marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Kendrew started, and showed the first tokens of interest in the\r\nproceedings which had escaped him yet. Mr. Delamayn looked at him for a\r\nmoment, and went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe case,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cas originally stated by you, and taken down in\r\nwriting by our head-clerk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Vanborough\xe2\x80\x99s temper began to show itself again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have we got to do with that now?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have made your\r\ninquiries to prove the correctness of my statement--haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have found out that I am right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have found out that you are right--if the case is right. I wish to be\r\nsure that no mistake has occurred between you and the clerk. This is a\r\nvery important matter. I am going to take the responsibility of giving\r\nan opinion which may be followed by serious consequences; and I mean to\r\nassure myself that the opinion is given on a sound basis, first. I have\r\nsome questions to ask you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be impatient, if you please. They won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe referred to the manuscript, and put the first question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were married at Inchmallock, in Ireland, Mr. Vanborough, thirteen\r\nyears since?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour wife--then Miss Anne Silvester--was a Roman Catholic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer father and mother were Roman Catholics?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Your_ father and mother were Protestants? and _you_ were baptized and\r\nbrought up in the Church of England?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Anne Silvester felt, and expressed, a strong repugnance to\r\nmarrying you, because you and she belonged to different religious\r\ncommunities?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou got over her objection by consenting to become a Roman Catholic,\r\nlike herself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the shortest way with her and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter to _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were formally received into the Roman Catholic Church?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went through the whole ceremony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbroad or at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long was it before the date of your marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix weeks before I was married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReferring perpetually to the paper in his hand, Mr. Delamayn was\r\nespecially careful in comparing that last answer with the answer given\r\nto the head-clerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and went on with his questions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe priest who married you was one Ambrose Redman--a young man recently\r\nappointed to his clerical duties?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he ask if you were both Roman Catholics?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he ask any thing more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure he never inquired whether you had both been Catholics _for\r\nmore than one year before you came to him to be married?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am certain of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe must have forgotten that part of his duty--or being only a beginner,\r\nhe may well have been ignorant of it altogether. Did neither you nor the\r\nlady think of informing him on the point?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither I nor the lady knew there was any necessity for informing him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Delamayn folded up the manuscript, and put it back in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cin every particular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Vanborough\xe2\x80\x99s swarthy complexion slowly turned pale. He cast one\r\nfurtive glance at Mr. Kendrew, and turned away again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the lawyer, \xe2\x80\x9cnow for your opinion! What is the law?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe law,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Delamayn, \xe2\x80\x9cis beyond all doubt or dispute. Your\r\nmarriage with Miss Anne Silvester is no marriage at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Kendrew started to his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, sternly.\r\n\r\nThe rising solicitor lifted his eyebrows in polite surprise. If Mr.\r\nKendrew wanted information, why should Mr. Kendrew ask for it in that\r\nway? \xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish me to go into the law of the case?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Delamayn stated the law, as that law still stands--to the disgrace\r\nof the English Legislature and the English Nation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the Irish Statute of George the Second,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cevery marriage\r\ncelebrated by a Popish priest between two Protestants, or between a\r\nPapist and any person who has been a Protestant within twelve months\r\nbefore the marriage, is declared null and void. And by two other Acts\r\nof the same reign such a celebration of marriage is made a felony on\r\nthe part of the priest. The clergy in Ireland of other religious\r\ndenominations have been relieved from this law. But it still remains in\r\nforce so far as the Roman Catholic priesthood is concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs such a state of things possible in the age we live in!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\nMr. Kendrew.\r\n\r\nMr. Delamayn smiled. He had outgrown the customary illusions as to the\r\nage we live in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are other instances in which the Irish marriage-law presents some\r\ncurious anomalies of its own,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is felony, as I have just\r\ntold you, for a Roman Catholic priest to celebrate a marriage which may\r\nbe lawfully celebrated by a parochial clergyman, a Presbyterian mini\r\nster, and a Non-conformist minister. It is also felony (by another law)\r\non the part of a parochial clergyman to celebrate a marriage that may be\r\nlawfully celebrated by a Roman Catholic priest. And it is again felony\r\n(by yet another law) for a Presbyterian minister and a Non-conformist\r\nminister to celebrate a marriage which may be lawfully celebrated by a\r\nclergyman of the Established Church. An odd state of things. Foreigners\r\nmight possibly think it a scandalous state of things. In this country\r\nwe don\xe2\x80\x99t appear to mind it. Returning to the present case, the results\r\nstand thus: Mr. Vanborough is a single man; Mrs. Vanborough is a single\r\nwoman; their child is illegitimate, and the priest, Ambrose Redman, is\r\nliable to be tried, and punished, as a felon, for marrying them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn infamous law!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Kendrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ the law,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Delamayn, as a sufficient answer to him.\r\n\r\nThus far not a word had escaped the master of the house. He sat with his\r\nlips fast closed and his eyes riveted on the table, thinking.\r\n\r\nMr. Kendrew turned to him, and broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the advice you wanted from me\r\nrelated to _this?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean to tell me that, foreseeing the present interview and the\r\nresult to which it might lead, you felt any doubt as to the course you\r\nwere bound to take? Am I really to understand that you hesitate to set\r\nthis dreadful mistake right, and to make the woman who is your wife in\r\nthe sight of Heaven your wife in the sight of the law?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you choose to put it in that light,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Vanborough; \xe2\x80\x9cif you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t consider--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want a plain answer to my question--\xe2\x80\x98yes, or no.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me speak, will you! A man has a right to explain himself, I\r\nsuppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Kendrew stopped him by a gesture of disgust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t trouble you to explain yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI prefer to leave\r\nthe house. You have given me a lesson, Sir, which I shall not forget.\r\nI find that one man may have known another from the days when they were\r\nboth boys, and may have seen nothing but the false surface of him in\r\nall that time. I am ashamed of having ever been your friend. You are a\r\nstranger to me from this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words he left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a curiously hot-headed man,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Mr. Delamayn. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\nwill allow me, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll change my mind. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a glass of wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Vanborough rose to his feet without replying, and took a turn in\r\nthe room impatiently. Scoundrel as he was--in intention, if not yet in\r\nact--the loss of the oldest friend he had in the world staggered him for\r\nthe moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is an awkward business, Delamayn,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you advise\r\nme to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Delamayn shook his head, and sipped his claret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI decline to advise you,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI take no responsibility,\r\nbeyond the responsibility of stating the law as it stands, in your\r\ncase.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Vanborough sat down again at the table, to consider the alternative\r\nof asserting or not asserting his freedom from the marriage tie. He had\r\nnot had much time thus far for turning the matter over in his mind.\r\nBut for his residence on the Continent the question of the flaw in his\r\nmarriage might no doubt have been raised long since. As things were,\r\nthe question had only taken its rise in a chance conversation with Mr.\r\nDelamayn in the summer of that year.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes the lawyer sat silent, sipping his wine, and the\r\nhusband sat silent, thinking his own thoughts. The first change that\r\ncame over the scene was produced by the appearance of a servant in the\r\ndining-room.\r\n\r\nMr. Vanborough looked up at the man with a sudden outbreak of anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man was a well-bred English servant. In other words, a human\r\nmachine, doing its duty impenetrably when it was once wound up. He had\r\nhis words to speak, and he spoke them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a lady at the door, Sir, who wishes to see the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe house is not to be seen at this time of the evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe machine had a message to deliver, and delivered it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lady desired me to present her apologies, Sir. I was to tell you\r\nshe was much pressed for time. This was the last house on the house\r\nagent\xe2\x80\x99s list, and her coachman is stupid about finding his way in\r\nstrange places.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, and tell the lady to go to the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Delamayn interfered--partly in the interests of his client, partly\r\nin the interests of propriety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou attach some importance, I think, to letting this house as soon as\r\npossible?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it wise--on account of a momentary annoyance--to lose an opportunity\r\nof laying your hand on a tenant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWise or not, it\xe2\x80\x99s an infernal nuisance to be disturbed by a stranger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as you please. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to interfere. I only wish to say--in\r\ncase you are thinking of my convenience as your guest--that it will be\r\nno nuisance to _me._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant impenetrably waited. Mr. Vanborough impatiently gave way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Let her in. Mind, if she comes here, she\xe2\x80\x99s only to look into\r\nthe room, and go out again. If she wants to ask questions, she must go\r\nto the agent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Delamayn interfered once more, in the interests, this time, of the\r\nlady of the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight it not be desirable,\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cto consult Mrs. Vanborough\r\nbefore you quite decide?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your mistress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the garden, or the paddock, Sir--I am not sure which.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t send all over the grounds in search of her. Tell the\r\nhouse-maid, and show the lady in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant withdrew. Mr. Delamayn helped himself to a second glass of\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent claret,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you get it direct from Bordeaux?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. Mr. Vanborough had returned to the contemplation of\r\nthe alternative between freeing himself or not freeing himself from the\r\nmarriage tie. One of his elbows was on the table, he bit fiercely at his\r\nfinger-nails. He muttered between his teeth, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sound of rustling silk made itself gently audible in the passage\r\noutside. The door opened, and the lady who had come to see the house\r\nappeared in the dining-room.\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nShe was tall and elegant; beautifully dressed, in the happiest\r\ncombination of simplicity and splendor. A light summer veil hung over\r\nher face. She lifted it, and made her apologies for disturbing the\r\ngentlemen over their wine, with the unaffected ease and grace of a\r\nhighly-bred woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray accept my excuses for this intrusion. I am ashamed to disturb you.\r\nOne look at the room will be quite enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus far she had addressed Mr. Delamayn, who happened to be nearest to\r\nher. Looking round the room her eye fell on Mr. Vanborough. She started,\r\nwith a loud exclamation of astonishment. _\xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d_ she said. \xe2\x80\x9cGood\r\nHeavens! who would have thought of meeting _you_ here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Vanborough, on his side, stood petrified.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Jane!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe barely looked at her while she spoke. His eyes wandered guiltily\r\ntoward the window which led into the garden. The situation was a\r\nterrible one--equally terrible if his wife discovered Lady Jane, or if\r\nLady Jane discovered his wife. For the moment nobody was visible on the\r\nlawn. There was time, if the chance only offered--there was time for\r\nhim to get the visitor out of the house. The visitor, innocent of all\r\nknowledge of the truth, gayly offered him her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe in mesmerism for the first time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is an\r\ninstance of magnetic sympathy, Mr. Vanborough. An invalid friend of mine\r\nwants a furnished house at Hampstead. I undertake to find one for her,\r\nand the day _I_ select to make the discovery is the day _you_ select for\r\ndining with a friend. A last house at Hampstead is left on my list--and\r\nin that house I meet you. Astonishing!\xe2\x80\x9d She turned to Mr. Delamayn. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\npresume I am addressing the owner of the house?\xe2\x80\x9d Before a word could\r\nbe said by either of the gentlemen she noticed the garden. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat pretty\r\ngrounds! Do I see a lady in the garden? I hope I have not driven her\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked round, and appealed to Mr. Vanborough. \xe2\x80\x9cYour friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, and, on this occasion, waited for a reply.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Vanborough\xe2\x80\x99s situation what reply was possible?\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanborough was not only visible--but audible--in the garden; giving\r\nher orders to one of the out-of-door servants with the tone and manner\r\nwhich proclaimed the mistress of the house. Suppose he said, \xe2\x80\x9cShe is\r\n_not_ my friend\xe2\x80\x99s wife?\xe2\x80\x9d Female curiosity would inevitably put the\r\nnext question, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is she?\xe2\x80\x9d Suppose he invented an explanation? The\r\nexplanation would take time, and time would give his wife an opportunity\r\nof discovering Lady Jane. Seeing all these considerations in one\r\nbreathless moment, Mr. Vanborough took the shortest and the boldest\r\nway out of the difficulty. He answered silently by an affirmative\r\ninclination of the head, which dextrously turned Mrs. Vanborough into to\r\nMrs. Delamayn without allowing Mr. Delamayn the opportunity of hearing\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s eye was habitually watchful, and the lawyer saw him.\r\n\r\nMastering in a moment his first natural astonishment at the liberty\r\ntaken with him, Mr. Delamayn drew the inevitable conclusion that there\r\nwas something wrong, and that there was an attempt (not to be permitted\r\nfor a moment) to mix him up in it. He advanced, resolute to contradict\r\nhis client, to his client\xe2\x80\x99s own face.\r\n\r\nThe voluble Lady Jane interrupted him before he could open his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight I ask one question? Is the aspect south? Of course it is! I ought\r\nto see by the sun that the aspect is south. These and the other two\r\nare, I suppose, the only rooms on the ground-floor? And is it quiet? Of\r\ncourse it\xe2\x80\x99s quiet! A charming house. Far more likely to suit my friend\r\nthan any I have seen yet. Will you give me the refusal of it till\r\nto-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d There she stopped for breath, and gave Mr. Delamayn his\r\nfirst opportunity of speaking to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cI really can\xe2\x80\x99t--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Vanborough--passing close behind him and whispering as he\r\npassed--stopped the lawyer before he could say a word more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t contradict me! My wife is coming this way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the same moment (still supposing that Mr. Delamayn was the master of\r\nthe house) Lady Jane returned to the charge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou appear to feel some hesitation,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want a\r\nreference?\xe2\x80\x9d She smiled satirically, and summoned her friend to her aid.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Vanborough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Vanborough, stealing step by step nearer to the window--intent, come\r\nwhat might of it, on keeping his wife out of the room--neither heeded\r\nnor heard her. Lady Jane followed him, and tapped him briskly on the\r\nshoulder with her parasol.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Mrs. Vanborough appeared on the garden side of the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I in the way?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, addressing her husband, after one steady\r\nlook at Lady Jane. \xe2\x80\x9cThis lady appears to be an old friend of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n There was a tone of sarcasm in that allusion to the parasol, which might\r\ndevelop into a tone of jealousy at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\r\n\r\nLady Jane was not in the least disconcerted. She had her double\r\nprivilege of familiarity with the men whom she liked--her privilege as\r\na woman of high rank, and her privilege as a young widow. She bowed to\r\nMrs. Vanborough, with all the highly-finished politeness of the order to\r\nwhich she belonged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lady of the house, I presume?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a gracious smile.\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanborough returned the bow coldly--entered the room first--and\r\nthen answered, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Jane turned to Mr. Vanborough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresent me!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, submitting resignedly to the formalities of the\r\nmiddle classes.\r\n\r\nMr. Vanborough obeyed, without looking at his wife, and without\r\nmentioning his wife\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Jane Parnell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, passing over the introduction as rapidly\r\nas possible. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me see you to your carriage,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, offering his\r\narm. \xe2\x80\x9cI will take care that you have the refusal of the house. You may\r\ntrust it all to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo! Lady Jane was accustomed to leave a favorable impression behind her\r\nwherever she went. It was a habit with her to be charming (in widely\r\ndifferent ways) to both sexes. The social experience of the upper\r\nclasses is, in England, an experience of universal welcome. Lady Jane\r\ndeclined to leave until she had thawed the icy reception of the lady of\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must repeat my apologies,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Mrs. Vanborough, \xe2\x80\x9cfor coming\r\nat this inconvenient time. My intrusion appears to have sadly disturbed\r\nthe two gentlemen. Mr. Vanborough looks as if he wished me a hundred\r\nmiles away. And as for your husband--\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped and glanced toward\r\nMr. Delamayn. \xe2\x80\x9cPardon me for speaking in that familiar way. I have not\r\nthe pleasure of knowing your husband\xe2\x80\x99s name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn speechless amazement Mrs. Vanborough\xe2\x80\x99s eyes followed the direction of\r\nLady Jane\xe2\x80\x99s eyes--and rested on the lawyer, personally a total stranger\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nMr. Delamayn, resolutely waiting his opportunity to speak, seized it\r\nonce more--and held it this time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is some misapprehension here, for\r\nwhich I am in no way responsible. I am _not_ that lady\xe2\x80\x99s husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Lady Jane\xe2\x80\x99s turn to be astonished. She looked at the lawyer.\r\nUseless! Mr. Delamayn had set himself right--Mr. Delamayn declined to\r\ninterfere further. He silently took a chair at the other end of the\r\nroom. Lady Jane addressed Mr. Vanborough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever the mistake may be,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are responsible for it.\r\nYou certainly told me this lady was your friend\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!!!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Vanborough--loudly, sternly, incredulously.\r\n\r\nThe inbred pride of the great lady began to appear behind the thin outer\r\nveil of politeness that covered it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will speak louder if you wish it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Vanborough told me\r\nyou were that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Vanborough whispered fiercely to his wife through his clenched\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole thing is a mistake. Go into the garden again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanborough\xe2\x80\x99s indignation was suspended for the moment in dread, as\r\nshe saw the passion and the terror struggling in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you look at me!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow you speak to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe only repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cGo into the garden!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Jane began to perceive, what the lawyer had discovered some minutes\r\npreviously--that there was something wrong in the villa at Hampstead.\r\nThe lady of the house was a lady in an anomalous position of some\r\nkind. And as the house, to all appearance, belonged to Mr. Vanborough\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriend, Mr. Vanborough\xe2\x80\x99s friend must (in spite of his recent disclaimer)\r\nbe in some way responsible for it. Arriving, naturally enough, at this\r\nerroneous conclusion, Lady Jane\xe2\x80\x99s eyes rested for an instant on Mrs.\r\nVanborough with a finely contemptuous expression of inquiry which would\r\nhave roused the spirit of the tamest woman in existence. The implied\r\ninsult stung the wife\xe2\x80\x99s sensitive nature to the quick. She turned once\r\nmore to her husband--this time without flinching.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that woman?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nLady Jane was equal to the emergency. The manner in which she wrapped\r\nherself up in her own virtue, without the slightest pretension on the\r\none hand, and without the slightest compromise on the other, was a sight\r\nto see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Vanborough,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou offered to take me to my carriage just\r\nnow. I begin to understand that I had better have accepted the offer at\r\nonce. Give me your arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Vanborough, \xe2\x80\x9cyour ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s looks are looks of\r\ncontempt; your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s words can bear but one interpretation. I am\r\ninnocently involved in some vile deception which I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\r\nBut this I do know--I won\xe2\x80\x99t submit to be insulted in my own house. After\r\nwhat you have just said I forbid my husband to give you his arm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer husband!\r\n\r\nLady Jane looked at Mr. Vanborough--at Mr. Vanborough, whom she\r\nloved; whom she had honestly believed to be a single man; whom she had\r\nsuspected, up to that moment, of nothing worse than of trying to screen\r\nthe frailties of his friend. She dropped her highly-bred tone; she lost\r\nher highly-bred manners. The sense of her injury (if this was true), the\r\npang of her jealousy (if that woman was his wife), stripped the human\r\nnature in her bare of all disguises, raised the angry color in her\r\ncheeks, and struck the angry fire out of her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can tell the truth, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, haughtily, \xe2\x80\x9cbe so good as\r\nto tell it now. Have you been falsely presenting yourself to the\r\nworld--falsely presenting yourself to _me_--in the character and with\r\nthe aspirations of a single man? Is that lady your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear her? do you see her?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Vanborough, appealing to\r\nher husband, in her turn. She suddenly drew back from him, shuddering\r\nfrom head to foot. \xe2\x80\x9cHe hesitates!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, faintly. \xe2\x80\x9cGood\r\nGod! he hesitates!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Jane sternly repeated her question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that lady your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe roused his scoundrel-courage, and said the fatal word:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Vanborough staggered back. She caught at the white curtains of the\r\nwindow to save herself from falling, and tore them. She looked at her\r\nhusband, with the torn curtain clenched fast in her hand. She asked\r\nherself, \xe2\x80\x9cAm I mad? or is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Jane drew a deep breath of relief. He was not married! He was\r\nonly a profligate single man. A profligate single man is shocking--but\r\nreclaimable. It is possible to blame him severely, and to insist on his\r\nreformation in the most uncompromising terms. It is also possible to\r\nforgive him, and marry him. Lady Jane took the necessary position\r\nunder the circumstances with perfect tact. She inflicted reproof in the\r\npresent without excluding hope in the future.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have made a very painful discovery,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gravely, to\r\nMr. Vanborough. \xe2\x80\x9cIt rests with _you_ to persuade me to forget it!\r\nGood-evening!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe accompanied the last words by a farewell look which aroused Mrs.\r\nVanborough to frenzy. She sprang forward and prevented Lady Jane from\r\nleaving the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t go yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Vanborough came forward to interfere. His wife eyed him with a\r\nterrible look, and turned from him with a terrible contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cThat man\r\nhas lied!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn justice to myself, I insist on proving it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She struck a bell on a table near her. The servant came in. \xe2\x80\x9cFetch my\r\nwriting-desk out of the next room.\xe2\x80\x9d She waited--with her back turned on\r\nher husband, with her eyes fixed on Lady Jane. Defenseless and alone\r\nshe stood on the wreck of her married life, superior to the husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntreachery, the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s indifference, and her rival\xe2\x80\x99s contempt. At\r\nthat dreadful moment her beauty shone out again with a gleam of its old\r\nglory. The grand woman, who in the old stage days had held thousands\r\nbreathless over the mimic woes of the scene, stood there grander than\r\never, in her own woe, and held the three people who looked at her\r\nbreathless till she spoke again.\r\n\r\nThe servant came in with the desk. She took out a paper and handed it to\r\nLady Jane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was a singer on the stage,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I was a single woman. The\r\nslander to which such women are exposed doubted my marriage. I provided\r\nmyself with the paper in your hand. It speaks for itself. Even the\r\nhighest society, madam, respects _that!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Jane examined the paper. It was a marriage-certificate. She turned\r\ndeadly pale, and beckoned to Mr. Vanborough. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you deceiving me?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nMr. Vanborough looked back into the far corner of the room, in which the\r\nlawyer sat, impenetrably waiting for events. \xe2\x80\x9cOblige me by coming here\r\nfor a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Delamayn rose and complied with the request. Mr. Vanborough\r\naddressed himself to Lady Jane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg to refer you to my man of business. _He_ is not interested in\r\ndeceiving you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I required simply to speak to the fact?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Delamayn. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndecline to do more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not wanted to do more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nListening intently to that interchange of question and answer, Mrs.\r\nVanborough advanced a step in silence. The high courage that had\r\nsustained her against outrage which had openly declared itself shrank\r\nunder the sense of something coming which she had not foreseen. A\r\nnameless dread throbbed at her heart and crept among the roots of her\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nLady Jane handed the certificate to the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn two words, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn two words, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Delamayn; \xe2\x80\x9cwaste paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is _not_ married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is _not_ married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation Lady Jane looked round at Mrs. Vanborough,\r\nstanding silent at her side--looked, and started back in terror. \xe2\x80\x9cTake\r\nme away!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, shrinking from the ghastly face that confronted her\r\nwith the fixed stare of agony in the great, glittering eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cTake me\r\naway! That woman will murder me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Vanborough gave her his arm and led her to the door. There was dead\r\nsilence in the room as he did it. Step by step the wife\xe2\x80\x99s eyes followed\r\nthem with the same dreadful stare, till the door closed and shut them\r\nout. The lawyer, left alone with the disowned and deserted woman, put\r\nthe useless certificate silently on the table. She looked from him to\r\nthe paper, and dropped, without a cry to warn him, without an effort to\r\nsave herself, senseless at his feet.\r\n\r\nHe lifted her from the floor and placed her on the sofa, and waited\r\nto see if Mr. Vanborough would come back. Looking at the beautiful\r\nface--still beautiful, even in the swoon--he owned it was hard on her.\r\nYes! in his own impenetrable way, the rising lawyer owned it was hard on\r\nher.\r\n\r\nBut the law justified it. There was no doubt in this case. The law\r\njustified it.\r\n\r\nThe trampling of horses and the grating of wheels sounded outside. Lady\r\nJane\xe2\x80\x99s carriage was driving away. Would the husband come back? (See what\r\na thing habit is! Even Mr. Delamayn still mechanically thought of him as\r\nthe husband--in the face of the law! in the face of the facts!)\r\n\r\nNo. Then minutes passed. And no sign of the husband coming back.\r\n\r\nIt was not wise to make a scandal in the house. It was not desirable (on\r\nhis own sole responsibility) to let the servants see what had happened.\r\nStill, there she lay senseless. The cool evening air came in through\r\nthe open window and lifted the light ribbons in her lace cap, lifted\r\nthe little lock of hair that had broken loose and drooped over her neck.\r\nStill, there she lay--the wife who had loved him, the mother of his\r\nchild--there she lay.\r\n\r\nHe stretched out his hand to ring the bell and summon help.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the quiet of the summer evening was once more\r\ndisturbed. He held his hand suspended over the bell. The noise outside\r\ncame nearer. It was again the trampling of horses and the grating of\r\nwheels. Advancing--rapidly advancing--stopping at the house.\r\n\r\nWas Lady Jane coming back?\r\n\r\nWas the husband coming back?\r\n\r\nThere was a loud ring at the bell--a quick opening of the house-door--a\r\nrustling of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s dress in the passage. The door of the room opened,\r\nand the woman appeared--alone. Not Lady Jane. A stranger--older, years\r\nolder, than Lady Jane. A plain woman, perhaps, at other times. A woman\r\nalmost beautiful now, with the eager happiness that beamed in her face.\r\n\r\nShe saw the figure on the sofa. She ran to it with a cry--a cry of\r\nrecognition and a cry of terror in one. She dropped on her knees--and\r\nlaid that helpless head on her bosom, and kissed, with a sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkisses, that cold, white cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my darling!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it thus we meet again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes! After all the years that had passed since the parting in the cabin\r\nof the ship, it was thus the two school-friends met again.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart the Second.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARCH OF TIME.\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nADVANCING from time past to time present, the Prologue leaves the date\r\nlast attained (the summer of eighteen hundred and fifty-five), and\r\ntravels on through an interval of twelve years--tells who lived, who\r\ndied, who prospered, and who failed among the persons concerned in the\r\ntragedy at the Hampstead villa--and, this done, leaves the reader at the\r\nopening of THE STORY in the spring of eighteen hundred and sixty-eight.\r\n\r\nThe record begins with a marriage--the marriage of Mr. Vanborough and\r\nLady Jane Parnell.\r\n\r\nIn three months from the memorable day when his solicitor had informed\r\nhim that he was a free man, Mr. Vanborough possessed the wife he\r\ndesired, to grace the head of his table and to push his fortunes in the\r\nworld--the Legislature of Great Britain being the humble servant of his\r\ntreachery, and the respectable accomplice of his crime.\r\n\r\nHe entered Parliament. He gave (thanks to his wife) six of the grandest\r\ndinners, and two of the most crowded balls of the season. He made a\r\nsuccessful first speech in the House of Commons. He endowed a church in\r\na poor neighborhood. He wrote an article which attracted attention in a\r\nquarterly review. He discovered, denounced, and remedied a crying abuse\r\nin the administration of a public charity. He received (thanks once\r\nmore to his wife) a member of the Royal family among the visitors at his\r\ncountry house in the autumn recess. These were his triumphs, and this\r\nhis rate of progress on the way to the peerage, during the first year of\r\nhis life as the husband of Lady Jane.\r\n\r\nThere was but one more favor that Fortune could confer on her spoiled\r\nchild--and Fortune bestowed it. There was a spot on Mr. Vanborough\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npast life as long as the woman lived whom he had disowned and deserted.\r\nAt the end of the first year Death took her--and the spot was rubbed\r\nout.\r\n\r\nShe had met the merciless injury inflicted on her with a rare patience,\r\nwith an admirable courage. It is due to Mr. Vanborough to admit that he\r\nbroke her heart, with the strictest attention to propriety. He offered\r\n(through his lawyer ) a handsome provision for her and for her child.\r\nIt was rejected, without an instant\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation. She repudiated his\r\nmoney--she repudiated his name. By the name which she had borne in her\r\nmaiden days--the name which she had made illustrious in her Art--the\r\nmother and daughter were known to all who cared to inquire after them\r\nwhen they had sunk in the world.\r\n\r\nThere was no false pride in the resolute attitude which she thus assumed\r\nafter her husband had forsaken her. Mrs. Silvester (as she was now\r\ncalled) gratefully accepted for herself, and for Miss Silvester,\r\nthe assistance of the dear old friend who had found her again in her\r\naffliction, and who remained faithful to her to the end. They lived with\r\nLady Lundie until the mother was strong enough to carry out the plan of\r\nlife which she had arranged for the future, and to earn her bread as a\r\nteacher of singing. To all appearance she rallied, and became herself\r\nagain, in a few months\xe2\x80\x99 time. She was making her way; she was winning\r\nsympathy, confidence, and respect every where--when she sank suddenly\r\nat the opening of her new life. Nobody could account for it. The doctors\r\nthemselves were divided in opinion. Scientifically speaking, there was\r\nno reason why she should die. It was a mere figure of speech--in no\r\ndegree satisfactory to any reasonable mind--to say, as Lady Lundie said,\r\nthat she had got her death-blow on the day when her husband deserted\r\nher. The one thing certain was the fact--account for it as you might.\r\nIn spite of science (which meant little), in spite of her own courage\r\n(which meant much), the woman dropped at her post and died.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of her illness her mind gave way. The friend of her\r\nold school-days, sitting at the bedside, heard her talking as if she\r\nthought herself back again in the cabin of the ship. The poor soul found\r\nthe tone, almost the look, that had been lost for so many years--the\r\ntone of the past time when the two girls had gone their different ways\r\nin the world. She said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will meet, darling, with all the old love\r\nbetween us,\xe2\x80\x9d just as she had said almost a lifetime since. Before the\r\nend her mind rallied. She surprised the doctor and the nurse by begging\r\nthem gently to leave the room. When they had gone she looked at Lady\r\nLundie, and woke, as it seemed, to consciousness from a dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlanche,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will take care of my child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe shall be _my_ child, Anne, when you are gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dying woman paused, and thought for a little. A sudden trembling\r\nseized her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep it a secret!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid for my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid? After what I have promised you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe solemnly repeated the words, \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid for my child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Anne is my second self--isn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is as fond of your child as I was of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is not called by her father\xe2\x80\x99s name--she is called by mine. She is\r\nAnne Silvester as I was. Blanche! _Will she end like Me?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question was put with the laboring breath, with the heavy accents\r\nwhich tell that death is near. It chilled the living woman who heard it\r\nto the marrow of her bones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think that!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, horror-struck. \xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wildness began to appear again in Anne Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. She made\r\nfeebly impatient signs with her hands. Lady Lundie bent over her, and\r\nheard her whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cLift me up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe lay in her friend\xe2\x80\x99s arms; she looked up in her friend\xe2\x80\x99s face; she\r\nwent back wildly to her fear for her child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t bring her up like Me! She must be a governess--she must get her\r\nbread. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let her act! don\xe2\x80\x99t let her sing! don\xe2\x80\x99t let her go on the\r\nstage!\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped--her voice suddenly recovered its sweetness of\r\ntone--she smiled faintly--she said the old girlish words once more,\r\nin the old girlish way, \xe2\x80\x9cVow it, Blanche!\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Lundie kissed her, and\r\nanswered, as she had answered when they parted in the ship, \xe2\x80\x9cI vow it,\r\nAnne!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe head sank, never to be lifted more. The last look of life flickered\r\nin the filmy eyes and went out. For a moment afterward her lips moved.\r\nLady Lundie put her ear close to them, and heard the dreadful question\r\nreiterated, in the same dreadful words: \xe2\x80\x9cShe is Anne Silvester--as I\r\nwas. _Will she end like Me?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nFive years passed--and the lives of the three men who had sat at the\r\ndinner-table in the Hampstead villa began, in their altered aspects, to\r\nreveal the progress of time and change.\r\n\r\nMr. Kendrew; Mr. Delamayn; Mr. Vanborough. Let the order in which they\r\nare here named be the order in which their lives are reviewed, as seen\r\nonce more after a lapse of five years.\r\n\r\nHow the husband\xe2\x80\x99s friend marked his sense of the husband\xe2\x80\x99s treachery has\r\nbeen told already. How he felt the death of the deserted wife is still\r\nleft to tell. Report, which sees the inmost hearts of men, and delights\r\nin turning them outward to the public view, had always declared that\r\nMr. Kendrew\xe2\x80\x99s life had its secret, and that the secret was a hopeless\r\npassion for the beautiful woman who had married his friend. Not a hint\r\never dropped to any living soul, not a word ever spoken to the woman\r\nherself, could be produced in proof of the assertion while the woman\r\nlived. When she died Report started up again more confidently than ever,\r\nand appealed to the man\xe2\x80\x99s own conduct as proof against the man himself.\r\n\r\nHe attended the funeral--though he was no relation. He took a few\r\nblades of grass from the turf with which they covered her grave--when he\r\nthought that nobody was looking at him. He disappeared from his club.\r\nHe traveled. He came back. He admitted that he was weary of England.\r\nHe applied for, and obtained, an appointment in one of the colonies.\r\nTo what conclusion did all this point? Was it not plain that his usual\r\ncourse of life had lost its attraction for him, when the object of his\r\ninfatuation had ceased to exist? It might have been so--guesses less\r\nlikely have been made at the truth, and have hit the mark. It is, at any\r\nrate, certain that he left England, never to return again. Another man\r\nlost, Report said. Add to that, a man in ten thousand--and, for once,\r\nReport might claim to be right.\r\n\r\nMr. Delamayn comes next.\r\n\r\nThe rising solicitor was struck off the roll, at his own request--and\r\nentered himself as a student at one of the Inns of Court. For three\r\nyears nothing was known of him but that he was reading hard and keeping\r\nhis terms. He was called to the Bar. His late partners in the firm knew\r\nthey could trust him, and put business into his hands. In two years he\r\nmade himself a position in Court. At the end of the two years he made\r\nhimself a position out of Court. He appeared as \xe2\x80\x9cJunior\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9ca famous\r\ncase,\xe2\x80\x9d in which the honor of a great family, and the title to a great\r\nestate were concerned. His \xe2\x80\x9cSenior\xe2\x80\x9d fell ill on the eve of the trial.\r\nHe conducted the case for the defendant and won it. The defendant\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do for you?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Delamayn answered, \xe2\x80\x9cPut me into\r\nParliament.\xe2\x80\x9d Being a landed gentleman, the defendant had only to issue\r\nthe necessary orders--and behold, Mr. Delamayn was in Parliament!\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons the new member and Mr. Vanborough met again.\r\n\r\nThey sat on the same bench, and sided with the same party. Mr. Delamayn\r\nnoticed that Mr. Vanborough was looking old and worn and gray. He put a\r\nfew questions to a well-informed person. The well-informed person shook\r\nhis head. Mr. Vanborough was rich; Mr. Vanborough was well-connected\r\n(through his wife); Mr. Van borough was a sound man in every sense of\r\nthe word; _but_--nobody liked him. He had done very well the first year,\r\nand there it had ended. He was undeniably clever, but he produced a\r\ndisagreeable impression in the House. He gave splendid entertainments,\r\nbut he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t popular in society. His party respected him, but when they\r\nhad any thing to give they passed him over. He had a temper of his\r\nown, if the truth must be told; and with nothing against him--on the\r\ncontrary, with every thing in his favor--he didn\xe2\x80\x99t make friends. A\r\nsoured man. At home and abroad, a soured man.\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nFive years more passed, dating from the day when the deserted wife was\r\nlaid in her grave. It was now the year eighteen hundred and sixty six.\r\n\r\nOn a certain day in that year two special items of news appeared in\r\nthe papers--the news of an elevation to the peerage, and the news of a\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\nGetting on well at the Bar, Mr. Delamayn got on better still in\r\nParliament. He became one of the prominent men in the House. Spoke\r\nclearly, sensibly, and modestly, and was never too long. Held the House,\r\nwhere men of higher abilities \xe2\x80\x9cbored\xe2\x80\x9d it. The chiefs of his party said\r\nopenly, \xe2\x80\x9cWe must do something for Delamayn,\xe2\x80\x9d The opportunity offered,\r\nand the chiefs kept their word. Their Solicitor-General was advanced\r\na step, and they put Delamayn in his place. There was an outcry on the\r\npart of the older members of the Bar. The Ministry answered, \xe2\x80\x9cWe want\r\na man who is listened to in the House, and we have got him.\xe2\x80\x9d The papers\r\nsupported the new nomination. A great debate came off, and the new\r\nSolicitor-General justified the Ministry and the papers. His enemies\r\nsaid, derisively, \xe2\x80\x9cHe will be Lord Chancellor in a year or two!\xe2\x80\x9d His\r\nfriends made genial jokes in his domestic circle, which pointed to the\r\nsame conclusion. They warned his two sons, Julius and Geoffrey (then at\r\ncollege), to be careful what acquaintances they made, as they might find\r\nthemselves the sons of a lord at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice. It really began to\r\nlook like something of the sort. Always rising, Mr. Delamayn rose next\r\nto be Attorney-General. About the same time--so true it is that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing\r\nsucceeds like success\xe2\x80\x9d--a childless relative died and left him a\r\nfortune. In the summer of \xe2\x80\x98sixty-six a Chief Judgeship fell vacant.\r\nThe Ministry had made a previous appointment which had been universally\r\nunpopular. They saw their way to supplying the place of their\r\nAttorney-General, and they offered the judicial appointment to Mr.\r\nDelamayn. He preferred remaining in the House of Commons, and refused\r\nto accept it. The Ministry declined to take No for an answer. They\r\nwhispered confidentially, \xe2\x80\x9cWill you take it with a peerage?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nDelamayn consulted his wife, and took it with a peerage. The London\r\n_Gazette_ announced him to the world as Baron Holchester of Holchester.\r\nAnd the friends of the family rubbed their hands and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did we\r\ntell you? Here are our two young friends, Julius and Geoffrey, the sons\r\nof a lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd where was Mr. Vanborough all this time? Exactly where we left him\r\nfive years since.\r\n\r\nHe was as rich, or richer, than ever. He was as well-connected as ever.\r\nHe was as ambitious as ever. But there it ended. He stood still in the\r\nHouse; he stood still in society; nobody liked him; he made no friends.\r\nIt was all the old story over again, with this difference, that the\r\nsoured man was sourer; the gray head, grayer; and the irritable temper\r\nmore unendurable than ever. His wife had her rooms in the house and he\r\nhad his, and the confidential servants took care that they never met\r\non the stairs. They had no children. They only saw each other at their\r\ngrand dinners and balls. People ate at their table, and danced on their\r\nfloor, and compared notes afterward, and said how dull it was. Step by\r\nstep the man who had once been Mr. Vanborough\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer rose, till the\r\npeerage received him, and he could rise no longer; while Mr. Vanborough,\r\non the lower round of the ladder, looked up, and noted it, with no more\r\nchance (rich as he was and well-connected as he was) of climbing to the\r\nHouse of Lords than your chance or mine.\r\n\r\nThe man\xe2\x80\x99s career was ended; and on the day when the nomination of the\r\nnew peer was announced, the man ended with it.\r\n\r\nHe laid the newspaper aside without making any remark, and went out.\r\nHis carriage set him down, where the green fields still remain, on the\r\nnorthwest of London, near the foot-path which leads to Hampstead. He\r\nwalked alone to the villa where he had once lived with the woman whom he\r\nhad so cruelly wronged. New houses had risen round it, part of the old\r\ngarden had been sold and built on. After a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation he\r\nwent to the gate and rang the bell. He gave the servant his card. The\r\nservant\xe2\x80\x99s master knew the name as the name of a man of great wealth,\r\nand of a Member of Parliament. He asked politely to what fortunate\r\ncircumstance he owed the honor of that visit. Mr. Vanborough answered,\r\nbriefly and simply, \xe2\x80\x9cI once lived here; I have associations with the\r\nplace with which it is not necessary for me to trouble you. Will you\r\nexcuse what must seem to you a very strange request? I should like\r\nto see the dining-room again, if there is no objection, and if I am\r\ndisturbing nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cstrange requests\xe2\x80\x9d of rich men are of the nature of \xe2\x80\x9cprivileged\r\ncommunications,\xe2\x80\x9d for this excellent reason, that they are sure not to be\r\nrequests for money. Mr. Vanborough was shown into the dining-room. The\r\nmaster of the house, secretly wondering, watched him.\r\n\r\nHe walked straight to a certain spot on the carpet, not far from the\r\nwindow that led into the garden, and nearly opposite the door. On that\r\nspot he stood silently, with his head on his breast--thinking. Was it\r\n_there_ he had seen her for the last time, on the day when he left the\r\nroom forever? Yes; it was there. After a minute or so he roused himself,\r\nbut in a dreamy, absent manner. He said it was a pretty place, and\r\nexpressed his thanks, and looked back before the door closed, and then\r\nwent his way again. His carriage picked him up where it had set him\r\ndown. He drove to the residence of the new Lord Holchester, and left\r\na card for him. Then he went home. Arrived at his house, his secretary\r\nreminded him that he had an appointment in ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99 time. He thanked\r\nthe secretary in the same dreamy, absent manner in which he had thanked\r\nthe owner of the villa, and went into his dressing-room. The person with\r\nwhom he had made the appointment came, and the secretary sent the valet\r\nup stairs to knock at the door. There was no answer. On trying the lock\r\nit proved to be turned inside. They broke open the door, and saw him\r\nlying on the sofa. They went close to look--and found him dead by his\r\nown hand.\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nDrawing fast to its close, the Prologue reverts to the two girls--and\r\ntells, in a few words, how the years passed with Anne and Blanche.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie more than redeemed the solemn pledge that she had given to\r\nher friend. Preserved from every temptation which might lure her into\r\na longing to follow her mother\xe2\x80\x99s career; trained for a teacher\xe2\x80\x99s life,\r\nwith all the arts and all the advantages that money could procure,\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s first and only essays as a governess were made, under Lady\r\nLundie\xe2\x80\x99s own roof, on Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s own child. The difference in the\r\nages of the girls--seven years--the love between them, which seemed,\r\nas time went on, to grow with their growth, favored the trial of the\r\nexperiment. In the double relation of teacher and friend to little\r\nBlanche, the girlhood of Anne Silvester the younger passed safely,\r\nhappily, uneventfully, in the modest sanctuary of home. Who could\r\nimagine a contrast more complete than the contrast between her early\r\nlife and her mother\xe2\x80\x99s? Who could see any thing but a death-bed delusion\r\nin the terrible question which had tortured the mother\xe2\x80\x99s last moments:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill she end like Me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut two events of importance occurred in the quiet family circle during\r\nthe lapse of years which is now under review. In eighteen hundred and\r\nfifty-eight the household was enlivened by the arrival of Sir Thomas\r\nLundie. In eighteen hundred and sixty-five the household was broken up\r\nby the return of Sir Thomas to India, accompanied by his wife.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s health had b een failing for some time previously. The\r\nmedical men, consulted on the case, agreed that a sea-voyage was the one\r\nchange needful to restore their patient\xe2\x80\x99s wasted strength--exactly at\r\nthe time, as it happened, when Sir Thomas was due again in India. For\r\nhis wife\xe2\x80\x99s sake, he agreed to defer his return, by taking the sea-voyage\r\nwith her. The one difficulty to get over was the difficulty of leaving\r\nBlanche and Anne behind in England.\r\n\r\nAppealed to on this point, the doctors had declared that at Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncritical time of life they could not sanction her going to India with\r\nher mother. At the same time, near and dear relatives came forward, who\r\nwere ready and anxious to give Blanche and her governess a home--Sir\r\nThomas, on his side, engaging to bring his wife back in a year and a\r\nhalf, or, at most, in two years\xe2\x80\x99 time. Assailed in all directions, Lady\r\nLundie\xe2\x80\x99s natural unwillingness to leave the girls was overruled. She\r\nconsented to the parting--with a mind secretly depressed, and secretly\r\ndoubtful of the future.\r\n\r\nAt the last moment she drew Anne Silvester on one side, out of hearing\r\nof the rest. Anne was then a young woman of twenty-two, and Blanche a\r\ngirl of fifteen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, simply, \xe2\x80\x9cI must tell _you_ what I can not tell Sir\r\nThomas, and what I am afraid to tell Blanche. I am going away, with\r\na mind that misgives me. I am persuaded I shall not live to return to\r\nEngland; and, when I am dead, I believe my husband will marry again.\r\nYears ago your mother was uneasy, on her death-bed, about _your_ future.\r\nI am uneasy, now, about Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s future. I promised my dear dead friend\r\nthat you should be like my own child to me--and it quieted her\r\nmind. Quiet my mind, Anne, before I go. Whatever happens in years to\r\ncome--promise me to be always, what you are now, a sister to Blanche.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand for the last time. With a full heart Anne\r\nSilvester kissed it, and gave the promise.\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nIn two months from that time one of the forebodings which had weighed on\r\nLady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s mind was fulfilled. She died on the voyage, and was buried\r\nat sea.\r\n\r\nIn a year more the second misgiving was confirmed. Sir Thomas Lundie\r\nmarried again. He brought his second wife to England toward the close of\r\neighteen hundred and sixty six.\r\n\r\nTime, in the new household, promised to pass as quietly as in the old.\r\nSir Thomas remembered and respected the trust which his first wife had\r\nplaced in Anne. The second Lady Lundie, wisely guiding her conduct in\r\nthis matter by the conduct of her husband, left things as she found them\r\nin the new house. At the opening of eighteen hundred and sixty-seven the\r\nrelations between Anne and Blanche were relations of sisterly sympathy\r\nand sisterly love. The prospect in the future was as fair as a prospect\r\ncould be.\r\n\r\nAt this date, of the persons concerned in the tragedy of twelve years\r\nsince at the Hampstead villa, three were dead; and one was self-exiled\r\nin a foreign land. There now remained living Anne and Blanche, who had\r\nbeen children at the time; and the rising solicitor who had discovered\r\nthe flaw in the Irish marriage--once Mr. Delamayn: now Lord Holchester.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST SCENE.--THE SUMMER-HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OWLS.\r\n\r\nIN the spring of the year eighteen hundred and sixty-eight there lived,\r\nin a certain county of North Britain, two venerable White Owls.\r\n\r\nThe Owls inhabited a decayed and deserted summer-house. The summer-house\r\nstood in grounds attached to a country seat in Perthshire, known by the\r\nname of Windygates.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Windygates had been skillfully chosen in that part\r\nof the county where the fertile lowlands first begin to merge into the\r\nmountain region beyond. The mansion-house was intelligently laid out,\r\nand luxuriously furnished. The stables offered a model for ventilation\r\nand space; and the gardens and grounds were fit for a prince.\r\n\r\nPossessed of these advantages, at starting, Windygates, nevertheless,\r\nwent the road to ruin in due course of time. The curse of litigation\r\nfell on house and lands. For more than ten years an interminable lawsuit\r\ncoiled itself closer and closer round the place, sequestering it from\r\nhuman habitation, and even from human approach. The mansion was closed.\r\nThe garden became a wilderness of weeds. The summer-house was choked up\r\nby creeping plants; and the appearance of the creepers was followed by\r\nthe appearance of the birds of night.\r\n\r\nFor years the Owls lived undisturbed on the property which they had\r\nacquired by the oldest of all existing rights--the right of taking.\r\nThroughout the day they sat peaceful and solemn, with closed eyes, in\r\nthe cool darkness shed round them by the ivy. With the twilight they\r\nroused themselves softly to the business of life. In sage and silent\r\ncompanionship of two, they went flying, noiseless, along the quiet lanes\r\nin search of a meal. At one time they would beat a field like a setter\r\ndog, and drop down in an instant on a mouse unaware of them. At another\r\ntime--moving spectral over the black surface of the water--they would\r\ntry the lake for a change, and catch a perch as they had caught the\r\nmouse. Their catholic digestions were equally tolerant of a rat or an\r\ninsect. And there were moments, proud moments, in their lives, when they\r\nwere clever enough to snatch a small bird at roost off his perch. On\r\nthose occasions the sense of superiority which the large bird feels\r\nevery where over the small, warmed their cool blood, and set them\r\nscreeching cheerfully in the stillness of the night.\r\n\r\nSo, for years, the Owls slept their happy sleep by day, and found their\r\ncomfortable meal when darkness fell. They had come, with the creepers,\r\ninto possession of the summer-house. Consequently, the creepers were a\r\npart of the constitution of the summer-house. And consequently the Owls\r\nwere the guardians of the Constitution. There are some human owls who\r\nreason as they did, and who are, in this respect--as also in respect of\r\nsnatching smaller birds off their roosts--wonderfully like them.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the summer-house had lasted until the spring of the\r\nyear eighteen hundred and sixty-eight, when the unhallowed footsteps\r\nof innovation passed that way; and the venerable privileges of the Owls\r\nwere assailed, for the first time, from the world outside.\r\n\r\nTwo featherless beings appeared, uninvited, at the door of the\r\nsummer-house, surveyed the constitutional creepers, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThese\r\nmust come down\xe2\x80\x9d--looked around at the horrid light of noonday, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cThat must come in\xe2\x80\x9d--went away, thereupon, and were heard, in the\r\ndistance, agreeing together, \xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow it shall be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the Owls said, \xe2\x80\x9cHave we honored the summer-house by occupying it all\r\nthese years--and is the horrid light of noonday to be let in on us at\r\nlast? My lords and gentlemen, the Constitution is destroyed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey passed a resolution to that effect, as is the manner of their kind.\r\nAnd then they shut their eyes again, and felt that they had done their\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nThe same night, on their way to the fields, they observed with dismay a\r\nlight in one of the windows of the house. What did the light mean?\r\n\r\nIt meant, in the first place, that the lawsuit was over at last. It\r\nmeant, in the second place that the owner of Windygates, wanting money,\r\nhad decided on letting the property. It meant, in the third place, that\r\nthe property had found a tenant, and was to be renovated immediately out\r\nof doors and in. The Owls shrieked as they flapped along the lanes in\r\nthe darkness, And that night they struck at a mouse--and missed him.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, the Owls--fast asleep in charge of the\r\nConstitution--were roused by voices of featherless beings all round\r\nthem. They opened their eyes, under protest, and saw instruments of\r\ndestruction attacking the creepers. Now in one direction, and now in\r\nanother, those instruments let in on the summer-house the horrid light\r\nof day. But the Owls were equal to the occasion. They ruffled their\r\nfeathers, and cried, \xe2\x80\x9cNo surrender!\xe2\x80\x9d The featherless beings plied their\r\nwork cheerfully, and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cReform!\xe2\x80\x9d The creepers were torn down\r\nthis way and that. The horrid daylight poured in brighter and brighter.\r\nThe Owls had barely time to pass a new resolution, namely, \xe2\x80\x9cThat we do\r\nstand by the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d when a ray of the outer sunlight flashed\r\ninto their eyes, and sent them flying headlong to the nearest shade.\r\nThere they sat winking, while the summer-house was cleared of the rank\r\ngrowth that had choked it up, while the rotten wood-work was renewed,\r\nwhile all the murky place was purified with air and light. And when the\r\nworld saw it, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow we shall do!\xe2\x80\x9d the Owls shut their eyes\r\nin pious remembrance of the darkness, and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cMy lords and\r\ngentlemen, the Constitution is destroyed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SECOND.\r\n\r\nTHE GUESTS.\r\n\r\nWho was responsible for the reform of the summer-house? The new tenant\r\nat Windygates was responsible.\r\n\r\nAnd who was the new tenant?\r\n\r\nCome, and see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of eighteen hundred and sixty-eight the summer-house had\r\nbeen the dismal dwelling-place of a pair of owls. In the autumn of the\r\nsame year the summer-house was the lively gathering-place of a crowd\r\nof ladies and gentlemen, assembled at a lawn party--the guests of the\r\ntenant who had taken Windygates.\r\n\r\nThe scene--at the opening of the party--was as pleasant to look at as\r\nlight and beauty and movement could make it.\r\n\r\nInside the summer-house the butterfly-brightness of the women in their\r\nsummer dresses shone radiant out of the gloom shed round it by the\r\ndreary modern clothing of the men. Outside the summer-house, seen\r\nthrough three arched openings, the cool green prospect of a lawn led\r\naway, in the distance, to flower-beds and shrubberies, and, farther\r\nstill, disclosed, through a break in the trees, a grand stone house\r\nwhich closed the view, with a fountain in front of it playing in the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nThey were half of them laughing, they were all of them talking--the\r\ncomfortable hum of their voices was at its loudest; the cheery pealing\r\nof the laughter was soaring to its highest notes--when one dominant\r\nvoice, rising clear and shrill above all the rest, called imperatively\r\nfor silence. The moment after, a young lady stepped into the vacant\r\nspace in front of the summer-house, and surveyed the throng of guests as\r\na general in command surveys a regiment under review.\r\n\r\nShe was young, she was pretty, she was plump, she was fair. She was not\r\nthe least embarrassed by her prominent position. She was dressed in the\r\nheight of the fashion. A hat, like a cheese-plate, was tilted over her\r\nforehead. A balloon of light brown hair soared, fully inflated, from the\r\ncrown of her head. A cataract of beads poured over her bosom. A pair of\r\ncock-chafers in enamel (frightfully like the living originals) hung at\r\nher ears. Her scanty skirts shone splendid with the blue of heaven. Her\r\nankles twinkled in striped stockings. Her shoes were of the sort called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWatteau.\xe2\x80\x9d And her heels were of the height at which men shudder, and\r\nask themselves (in contemplating an otherwise lovable woman), \xe2\x80\x9cCan this\r\ncharming person straighten her knees?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young lady thus presenting herself to the general view was Miss\r\nBlanche Lundie--once the little rosy Blanche whom the Prologue has\r\nintroduced to the reader. Age, at the present time, eighteen. Position,\r\nexcellent. Money, certain. Temper, quick. Disposition, variable. In a\r\nword, a child of the modern time--with the merits of the age we live in,\r\nand the failings of the age we live in--and a substance of sincerity and\r\ntruth and feeling underlying it all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, good people,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Blanche, \xe2\x80\x9csilence, if you please! We\r\nare going to choose sides at croquet. Business, business, business!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon this, a second lady among the company assumed a position of\r\nprominence, and answered the young person who had just spoken with a\r\nlook of mild reproof, and in a tone of benevolent protest.\r\n\r\nThe second lady was tall, and solid, and five-and-thirty. She presented\r\nto the general observation a cruel aquiline nose, an obstinate straight\r\nchin, magnificent dark hair and eyes, a serene splendor of fawn-colored\r\napparel, and a lazy grace of movement which was attractive at\r\nfirst sight, but inexpressibly monotonous and wearisome on a longer\r\nacquaintance. This was Lady Lundie the Second, now the widow (after four\r\nmonths only of married life) of Sir Thomas Lundie, deceased. In other\r\nwords, the step-mother of Blanche, and the enviable person who had taken\r\nthe house and lands of Windygates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Lundie, \xe2\x80\x9cwords have their meanings--even on a young\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s lips. Do you call Croquet, \xe2\x80\x98business?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t call it pleasure, surely?\xe2\x80\x9d said a gravely ironical voice in\r\nthe back-ground of the summer-house.\r\n\r\nThe ranks of the visitors parted before the last speaker, and disclosed\r\nto view, in the midst of that modern assembly, a gentleman of the bygone\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe manner of this gentleman was distinguished by a pliant grace and\r\ncourtesy unknown to the present generation. The attire of this gentleman\r\nwas composed of a many-folded white cravat, a close-buttoned blue\r\ndress-coat, and nankeen trousers with gaiters to match, ridiculous\r\nto the present generation. The talk of this gentleman ran in an\r\neasy flow--revealing an independent habit of mind, and exhibiting a\r\ncarefully-polished capacity for satirical retort--dreaded and disliked\r\nby the present generation. Personally, he was little and wiry and\r\nslim--with a bright white head, and sparkling black eyes, and a wry\r\ntwist of humor curling sharply at the corners of his lips. At his lower\r\nextremities, he exhibited the deformity which is popularly known as \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nclub-foot.\xe2\x80\x9d But he carried his lameness, as he carried his years, gayly.\r\nHe was socially celebrated for his ivory cane, with a snuff-box artfully\r\nlet into the knob at the top--and he was socially dreaded for a hatred\r\nof modern institutions, which expressed itself in season and out of\r\nseason, and which always showed the same, fatal knack of hitting smartly\r\non the weakest place. Such was Sir Patrick Lundie; brother of the late\r\nbaronet, Sir Thomas; and inheritor, at Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s death, of the title\r\nand estates.\r\n\r\nMiss Blanche--taking no notice of her step-mother\xe2\x80\x99s reproof, or of her\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s commentary on it--pointed to a table on which croquet mallets\r\nand balls were laid ready, and recalled the attention of the company to\r\nthe matter in hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI head one side, ladies and gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Lady Lundie\r\nheads the other. We choose our players turn and turn about. Mamma has\r\nthe advantage of me in years. So mamma chooses first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a look at her step-daughter--which, being interpreted, meant, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwould send you back to the nursery, miss, if I could!\xe2\x80\x9d--Lady Lundie\r\nturned and ran her eye over her guests. She had evidently made up her\r\nmind, beforehand, what player to pick out first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI choose Miss Silvester,\xe2\x80\x9d she said--with a special emphasis laid on the\r\nname.\r\n\r\nAt that there was another parting among the crowd. To us (who know her),\r\nit was Anne who now appeared. Strangers, who saw her for the first\r\ntime, saw a lady in the prime of her life--a lady plainly dressed in\r\nunornamented white--who advanced slowly, and confronted the mistress of\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nA certain proportion--and not a small one--of the men at the lawn-party\r\nhad been brought there by friends who were privileged to introduce\r\nthem. The moment she appeared every one of those men suddenly became\r\ninterested in the lady who had been chosen first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a very charming woman,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered one of the strangers at the\r\nhouse to one of the friends of the house. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe friend whispered back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s governess--that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe moment during which the question was put and answered was also the\r\nmoment which brought Lady Lundie and Miss Silvester face to face in the\r\npresence of the company.\r\n\r\nThe stranger at the house looked at the two women, and whispered again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething wrong between the lady and the governess,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe friend looked also, and answered, in one emphatic word:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvidently!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere are certain women whose influence over men is an unfathomable\r\nmystery to observers of their own sex. The governess was one of those\r\nwomen. She had inherited the charm, but not the beauty, of her unhappy\r\nmother. Judge her by the standard set up in the illustrated gift-books\r\nand the print-shop windows--and the sentence must have inevitably\r\nfollowed. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has not a single good feature in her face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was nothing individually remarkable about Miss Silvester, seen in\r\na state of repose. She was of the average height. She was as well made\r\nas most women. In hair and complexion she was neither light nor dark,\r\nbut provokingly neutral just between the two. Worse even than this,\r\nthere were positive defects in her face, which it was impossible to\r\ndeny. A nervous contraction at one corner of her mouth drew up the\r\nlips out of the symmetrically right line, when, they moved. A nervous\r\nuncertainty in the eye on the same side narrowly escaped presenting the\r\ndeformity of a \xe2\x80\x9ccast.\xe2\x80\x9d And yet, with these indisputable drawbacks, here\r\nwas one of those women--the formidable few--who have the hearts of men\r\nand the peace of families at their mercy. She moved--and there was some\r\nsubtle charm, Sir, in the movement, that made you look back, and suspend\r\nyour conversation with your friend, and watch her silently while she\r\nwalked. She sat by you and talked to you--and behold, a sensitive\r\nsomething passed into that little twist at the corner of the mouth, and\r\ninto that nervous uncertainty in the soft gray eye, which turned defect\r\ninto beauty--which enchained your senses--which made your nerves thrill\r\nif she touched you by accident, and set your heart beating if you looked\r\nat the same book with her, and felt her breath on your face. All this,\r\nlet it be well understood, only happened if you were a man.\r\n\r\nIf you saw her with the eyes of a woman, the results were of quite\r\nanother kind. In that case you merely turned to your nearest female\r\nfriend, and said, with unaffected pity for the other sex, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat _can_\r\nthe men see in her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the lady of the house and the eyes of the governess met,\r\nwith marked distrust on either side. Few people could have failed to\r\nsee what the stranger and the friend had noticed alike--that there was\r\nsomething smoldering under the surface here. Miss Silvester spoke first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Lady Lundie,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather not play.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie assumed an extreme surprise which passed the limits of\r\ngood-breeding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined, sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cConsidering that we are all here\r\nfor the purpose of playing, that seems rather remarkable. Is any thing\r\nwrong, Miss Silvester?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA flush appeared on the delicate paleness of Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\nBut she did her duty as a woman and a governess. She submitted, and so\r\npreserved appearances, for that time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing is the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not very well this morning.\r\nBut I will play if you wish it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do wish it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Lady Lundie.\r\n\r\nMiss Silvester turned aside toward one of the entrances into the\r\nsummer-house. She waited for events, looking out over the lawn, with a\r\nvisible inner disturbance, marked over the bosom by the rise and fall of\r\nher white dress.\r\n\r\nIt was Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s turn to select the next player.\r\n\r\nIn some preliminary uncertainty as to her choice she looked about among\r\nthe guests, and caught the eye of a gentleman in the front ranks. He\r\nstood side by side with Sir Patrick--a striking representative of the\r\nschool that is among us--as Sir Patrick was a striking representative of\r\nthe school that has passed away.\r\n\r\nThe modern gentleman was young and florid, tall and strong. The parting\r\nof his curly Saxon locks began in the center of his forehead, traveled\r\nover the top of his head, and ended, rigidly-central, at the ruddy nape\r\nof his neck. His features were as perfectly regular and as perfectly\r\nunintelligent as human features can be. His expression preserved an\r\nimmovable composure wonderful to behold. The muscles of his brawny arms\r\nshowed through the sleeves of his light summer coat. He was deep in the\r\nchest, thin in the flanks, firm on the legs--in two words a magnificent\r\nhuman animal, wrought up to the highest pitch of physical development,\r\nfrom head to foot. This was Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn--commonly called \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nhonorable;\xe2\x80\x9d and meriting that distinction in more ways than one. He was\r\nhonorable, in the first place, as being the son (second son) of that\r\nonce-rising solicitor, who was now Lord Holchester. He was honorable,\r\nin the second place, as having won the highest popular distinction which\r\nthe educational system of modern England can bestow--he had pulled the\r\nstroke-oar in a University boat-race. Add to this, that nobody had ever\r\nseen him read any thing but a newspaper, and that nobody had ever\r\nknown him to be backward in settling a bet--and the picture of this\r\ndistinguished young Englishman will be, for the present, complete.\r\n\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s eye naturally rested on him. Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s voice naturally picked\r\nhim out as the first player on her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI choose Mr. Delamayn,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nAs the name passed her lips the flush on Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s face died\r\naway, and a deadly paleness took its place. She made a movement to leave\r\nthe summer-house--checked herself abruptly--and laid one hand on the\r\nback of a rustic seat at her side. A gentleman behind her, looking at\r\nthe hand, saw it clench itself so suddenly and so fiercely that\r\nthe glove on it split. The gentleman made a mental memorandum, and\r\nregistered Miss Silvester in his private books as \xe2\x80\x9cthe devil\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\ntemper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Delamayn, by a strange coincidence, took exactly the same\r\ncourse which Miss Silvester had taken before him. He, too, attempted to\r\nwithdraw from the coming game.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks very much,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cCould you additionally honor me by\r\nchoosing somebody else? It\xe2\x80\x99s not in my line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFifty years ago such an answer as this, addressed to a lady, would have\r\nbeen considered inexcusably impertinent. The social code of the present\r\ntime hailed it as something frankly amusing. The company laughed.\r\nBlanche lost her temper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t we interest you in any thing but severe muscular exertion,\r\nMr. Delamayn?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cMust you always be pulling in a\r\nboat-race, or flying over a high jump? If you had a mind, you would want\r\nto relax it. You have got muscles instead. Why not relax _them_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shafts of Miss Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s bitter wit glided off Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn\r\nlike water off a duck\xe2\x80\x99s back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as you please,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with stolid good-humor. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\noffended. I came here with ladies--and they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let me smoke. I\r\nmiss my smoke. I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d slip away a bit and have it. All right!\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll play.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! smoke by all means!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall choose somebody\r\nelse. I won\xe2\x80\x99t have you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe honorable young gentleman looked unaffectedly relieved. The petulant\r\nyoung lady turned her back on him, and surveyed the guests at the other\r\nextremity of the summer-house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho shall I choose?\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself.\r\n\r\nA dark young man--with a face burned gipsy-brown by the sun; with\r\nsomething in his look and manner suggestive of a roving life, and\r\nperhaps of a familiar acquaintance with the sea--advanced shyly, and\r\nsaid, in a whisper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChoose me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s face broke prettily into a charming smile. Judging from\r\nappearances, the dark young man had a place in her estimation peculiarly\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, coquettishly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are going to leave us in an hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntime!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ventured a step nearer. \xe2\x80\x9cI am coming back,\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded, \xe2\x80\x9cthe day\r\nafter to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou play very badly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might improve--if you would teach me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight you? Then I will teach you!\xe2\x80\x9d She turned, bright and rosy, to her\r\nstep-mother. \xe2\x80\x9cI choose Mr. Arnold Brinkworth,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHere, again, there appeared to be something in a name unknown to\r\ncelebrity, which nevertheless produced its effect--not, this time, on\r\nMiss Silvester, but on Sir Patrick. He looked at Mr. Brinkworth with a\r\nsudden interest and curiosity. If the lady of the house had not claimed\r\nhis attention at the moment he would evidently have spoken to the dark\r\nyoung man.\r\n\r\nBut it was Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s turn to choose a second player on her side.\r\nHer brother-in-law was a person of some importance; and she had her\r\nown motives for ingratiating herself with the head of the family. She\r\nsurprised the whole company by choosing Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can you be thinking of? Sir Patrick won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nplay. Croquet wasn\xe2\x80\x99t discovered in his time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick never allowed \xe2\x80\x9chis time\xe2\x80\x9d to be made the subject of\r\ndisparaging remarks by the younger generation without paying the\r\nyounger generation back in its own coin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn _my_ time, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his niece, \xe2\x80\x9cpeople were expected to\r\nbring some agreeable quality with them to social meetings of this sort.\r\nIn your time you have dispensed with all that. Here,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the old\r\ngentleman, taking up a croquet mallet from the table near him, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\none of the qualifications for success in modern society. And here,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, taking up a ball, \xe2\x80\x9cis another. Very good. Live and learn. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nplay! I\xe2\x80\x99ll play!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie (born impervious to all sense of irony) smiled graciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew Sir Patrick would play,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto please me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick bowed with satirical politeness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Lundie,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cyou read me like a book.\xe2\x80\x9d To the\r\nastonishment of all persons present under forty he emphasized those\r\nwords by laying his hand on his heart, and quoting poetry. \xe2\x80\x9cI may say\r\nwith Dryden,\xe2\x80\x9d added the gallant old gentleman:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Old as I am, for ladies\xe2\x80\x99 love unfit,\r\n     The power of beauty I remember yet.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie looked unaffectedly shocked. Mr. Delamayn went a step\r\nfarther. He interfered on the spot--with the air of a man who feels\r\nhimself imperatively called upon to perform a public duty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDryden never said that,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll answer for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick wheeled round with the help of his ivory cane, and looked\r\nMr. Delamayn hard in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know Dryden, Sir, better than I do?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Geoffrey answered, modestly, \xe2\x80\x9cI should say I did. I have\r\nrowed three races with him, and we trained together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick looked round him with a sour smile of triumph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let me tell you, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you trained with a man who\r\ndied nearly two hundred years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Delamayn appealed, in genuine bewilderment, to the company\r\ngenerally:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this old gentleman mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI am speaking of Tom\r\nDryden, of Corpus. Every body in the University knows _him._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am speaking,\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cof John Dryden the Poet.\r\nApparently, every body in the University does _not_ know _him!\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nMr. Delamayn answered, with a cordial earnestness very pleasant to see:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive you my word of honor, I never heard of him before in my life!\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t be angry, Sir. _I\xe2\x80\x99m_ not offended with _you._\xe2\x80\x9d He smiled, and took\r\nout his brier-wood pipe. \xe2\x80\x9cGot a light?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, in the friendliest\r\npossible manner.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick answered, with a total absence of cordiality:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t smoke, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Delamayn looked at him, without taking the slightest offense:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t smoke!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder how you get through your spare\r\ntime?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick closed the conversation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a low bow, \xe2\x80\x9cyou _may_ wonder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile this little skirmish was proceeding Lady Lundie and her\r\nstep-daughter had organized the game; and the company, players and\r\nspectators, were beginning to move toward the lawn. Sir Patrick stopped\r\nhis niece on her way out, with the dark young man in close attendance on\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave Mr. Brinkworth with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to speak to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche issued her orders immediately. Mr. Brinkworth was sentenced to\r\nstay with Sir Patrick until she wanted him for the game. Mr. Brinkworth\r\nwondered, and obeyed.\r\n\r\nDuring the exercise of this act of authority a circumstance occurred\r\nat the other end of the summer-house. Taking advantage of the confusion\r\ncaused by the general movement to the lawn, Miss Silvester suddenly\r\nplaced herself close to Mr. Delamayn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn ten minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cthe summer-house will be empty. Meet\r\nme here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Geoffrey started, and looked furtively at the visitors\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe?\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered back.\r\n\r\nThe governess\xe2\x80\x99s sensitive lips trembled, with fear or with anger, it was\r\nhard to say which.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI insist on it!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, and left him.\r\n\r\nMr. Delamayn knitted his handsome eyebrows as he looked after her, and\r\nthen left the summer-house in his turn. The rose-garden at the back of\r\nthe building was solitary for the moment. He took out his pipe and hid\r\nhimself among the roses. The smoke came from his mouth in hot and hasty\r\npuffs. He was usually the gentlest of masters--to his pipe. When he\r\nhurried that confidential servant, it was a sure sign of disturbance in\r\nthe inner man.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRD.\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERIES.\r\n\r\nBUT two persons were now left in the summer-house--Arnold Brinkworth and\r\nSir Patrick Lundie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Brinkworth,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cI have had no opportunity of\r\nspeaking to you before this; and (as I hear that you are to leave us,\r\nto-day) I may find no opportunity at a later time. I want to introduce\r\nmyself. Your father was one of my dearest friends--let me make a friend\r\nof your father\xe2\x80\x99s son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe held out his hands, and mentioned his name.\r\n\r\nArnold recognized it directly. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Sir Patrick!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, warmly, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nmy poor father had only taken your advice--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would have thought twice before he gambled away his fortune on the\r\nturf; and he might have been alive here among us, instead of dying an\r\nexile in a foreign land,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick, finishing the sentence which\r\nthe other had begun. \xe2\x80\x9cNo more of that! Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk of something else.\r\nLady Lundie wrote to me about you the other day. She told me your aunt\r\nwas dead, and had left you heir to her property in Scotland. Is that\r\ntrue?--It is?--I congratulate you with all my heart. Why are you\r\nvisiting here, instead of looking after your house and lands? Oh! it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly three-and-twenty miles from this; and you\xe2\x80\x99re going to look after\r\nit to-day, by the next train? Quite right. And--what? what?--coming back\r\nagain the day after to-morrow? Why should you come back? Some special\r\nattraction here, I suppose? I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s the right sort of attraction.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re very young--you\xe2\x80\x99re exposed to all sorts of temptations. Have you\r\ngot a solid foundation of good sense at the bottom of you? It is not\r\ninherited from your poor father, if you have. You must have been a mere\r\nboy when he ruined his children\xe2\x80\x99s prospects. How have you lived from\r\nthat time to this? What were you doing when your aunt\xe2\x80\x99s will made an\r\nidle man of you for life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question was a searching one. Arnold answered it, without the\r\nslightest hesitation; speaking with an unaffected modesty and simplicity\r\nwhich at once won Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was a boy at Eton, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen my father\xe2\x80\x99s losses ruined\r\nhim. I had to leave school, and get my own living; and I have got it,\r\nin a roughish way, from that time to this. In plain English, I have\r\nfollowed the sea--in the merchant-service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn plainer English still, you met adversity like a brave lad, and you\r\nhave fairly earned the good luck that has fallen to you,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Sir\r\nPatrick. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me your hand--I have taken a liking to you. You\xe2\x80\x99re not\r\nlike the other young fellows of the present time. I shall call you\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Arnold.\xe2\x80\x99 You mus\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t return the compliment and call me \xe2\x80\x98Patrick,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmind--I\xe2\x80\x99m too old to be treated in that way. Well, and how do you get on\r\nhere? What sort of a woman is my sister-in-law? and what sort of a house\r\nis this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are extraordinary questions for you to put to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ntalk, Sir, as if you were a stranger here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick touched a spring in the knob of his ivory cane. A little\r\ngold lid flew up, and disclosed the snuff-box hidden inside. He took a\r\npinch, and chuckled satirically over some passing thought, which he did\r\nnot think it necessary to communicate to his young friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI talk as if I was a stranger here, do I?\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly\r\nwhat I am. Lady Lundie and I correspond on excellent terms; but we run\r\nin different grooves, and we see each other as seldom as possible. My\r\nstory,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the pleasant old man, with a charming frankness which\r\nleveled all differences of age and rank between Arnold and himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis not entirely unlike yours; though I _am_ old enough to be your\r\ngrandfather. I was getting my living, in my way (as a crusty old Scotch\r\nlawyer), when my brother married again. His death, without leaving a son\r\nby either of his wives, gave me a lift in the world, like you. Here I\r\nam (to my own sincere regret) the present baronet. Yes, to my sincere\r\nregret! All sorts of responsibilities which I never bargained for are\r\nthrust on my shoulders. I am the head of the family; I am my niece\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nguardian; I am compelled to appear at this lawn-party--and (between\r\nourselves) I am as completely out of my element as a man can be. Not a\r\nsingle familiar face meets _me_ among all these fine people. Do you know\r\nany body here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have one friend at Windygates,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cHe came here this\r\nmorning, like you. Geoffrey Delamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he made the reply, Miss Silvester appeared at the entrance to the\r\nsummer-house. A shadow of annoyance passed over her face when she saw\r\nthat the place was occupied. She vanished, unnoticed, and glided back to\r\nthe game.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick looked at the son of his old friend, with every appearance\r\nof being disappointed in the young man for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour choice of a friend rather surprises me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nArnold artlessly accepted the words as an appeal to him for information.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Sir--there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing surprising in it,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were school-fellows at Eton, in the old times. And I have met\r\nGeoffrey since, when he was yachting, and when I was with my ship.\r\nGeoffrey saved my life, Sir Patrick,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, his voice rising, and\r\nhis eyes brightening with honest admiration of his friend. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for\r\nhim, I should have been drowned in a boat-accident. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t _that_ a good\r\nreason for his being a friend of mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt depends entirely on the value you set on your life,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir\r\nPatrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe value I set on my life?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cI set a high value on\r\nit, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, Mr. Delamayn has laid you under an obligation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich I can never repay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich you will repay one of these days, with interest--if I know any\r\nthing of human nature,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\nHe said the words with the emphasis of strong conviction. They were\r\nbarely spoken when Mr. Delamayn appeared (exactly as Miss Silvester\r\nhad appeared) at the entrance to the summer-house. He, too, vanished,\r\nunnoticed--like Miss Silvester again. But there the parallel stopped.\r\nThe Honorable Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s expression, on discovering the place to be\r\noccupied, was, unmistakably an expression of relief.\r\n\r\nArnold drew the right inference, this time, from Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s language\r\nand Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s tones. He eagerly took up the defense of his friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said that rather bitterly, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has Geoffrey\r\ndone to offend you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe presumes to exist--that\xe2\x80\x99s what he has done,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Sir Patrick.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t stare! I am speaking generally. Your friend is the model young\r\nBriton of the present time. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the model young Briton. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see the sense of crowing over him as a superb national production,\r\nbecause he is big and strong, and drinks beer with impunity, and takes a\r\ncold shower bath all the year round. There is far too much glorification\r\nin England, just now, of the mere physical qualities which an Englishman\r\nshares with the savage and the brute. And the ill results are beginning\r\nto show themselves already! We are readier than we ever were to practice\r\nall that is rough in our national customs, and to excuse all that is\r\nviolent and brutish in our national acts. Read the popular books--attend\r\nthe popular amusements; and you will find at the bottom of them all a\r\nlessening regard for the gentler graces of civilized life, and a growing\r\nadmiration for the virtues of the aboriginal Britons!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold listened in blank amazement. He had been the innocent means\r\nof relieving Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s mind of an accumulation of social protest,\r\nunprovided with an issue for some time past. \xe2\x80\x9cHow hot you are over it,\r\nSir!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, in irrepressible astonishment.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick instantly recovered himself. The genuine wonder expressed in\r\nthe young man\xe2\x80\x99s face was irresistible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlmost as hot,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cas if I was cheering at a boat-race, or\r\nwrangling over a betting-book--eh? Ah, we were so easily heated when\r\nI was a young man! Let\xe2\x80\x99s change the subject. I know nothing to the\r\nprejudice of your friend, Mr. Delamayn. It\xe2\x80\x99s the cant of the day,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nSir Patrick, relapsing again, \xe2\x80\x9cto take these physically-wholesome men\r\nfor granted as being morally-wholesome men into the bargain. Time will\r\nshow whether the cant of the day is right.--So you are actually coming\r\nback to Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s after a mere flying visit to your own property? I\r\nrepeat, that is a most extraordinary proceeding on the part of a landed\r\ngentleman like you. What\xe2\x80\x99s the attraction here--eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore Arnold could reply Blanche called to him from the lawn. His color\r\nrose, and he turned eagerly to go out. Sir Patrick nodded his head with\r\nthe air of a man who had been answered to his own entire satisfaction.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9c_that\xe2\x80\x99s_ the attraction, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s life at sea had left him singularly ignorant of the ways of the\r\nworld on shore. Instead of taking the joke, he looked confused. A deeper\r\ntinge of color reddened his dark cheeks. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say so,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered,\r\na little irritably.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick lifted two of his white, wrinkled old fingers, and\r\ngood-humoredly patted the young sailor on the cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes you did,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn red letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little gold lid in the knob of the ivory cane flew up, and the old\r\ngentleman rewarded himself for that neat retort with a pinch of snuff.\r\nAt the same moment Blanche made her appearance on the scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Brinkworth,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall want you directly. Uncle, it\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nturn to play.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cI forgot the game.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked about\r\nhim, and saw his mallet and ball left waiting on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are\r\nthe modern substitutes for conversation? Oh, here they are!\xe2\x80\x9d He bowled\r\nthe ball out before him on to the lawn, and tucked the mallet, as if it\r\nwas an umbrella, under his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cWho was the first mistaken person,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid to himself, as he briskly hobbled out, \xe2\x80\x9cwho discovered that human\r\nlife was a serious thing? Here am I, with one foot in the grave; and the\r\nmost serious question before me at the present moment is, Shall I get\r\nthrough the Hoops?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold and Blanche were left together.\r\n\r\nAmong the personal privileges which Nature has accorded to women, there\r\nare surely none more enviable than their privilege of always looking\r\ntheir best when they look at the man they love. When Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\nturned on Arnold after her uncle had gone out, not even the hideous\r\nfashionable disfigurements of the inflated \xe2\x80\x9cchignon\xe2\x80\x9d and the tilted hat\r\ncould destroy the triple charm of youth, beauty, and tenderness beaming\r\nin her face. Arnold looked at her--and remembered, as he had never\r\nremembered yet, that he was going by the next train, and that he was\r\nleaving her in the society of more than one admiring man of his own age.\r\nThe experience of a whole fortnight passed under the same roof with her\r\nhad proved Blanche to be the most charming girl in existence. It was\r\npossible that she might not be mortally offended with him if he told her\r\nso. He determined that he _would_ tell her so at that auspicious moment.\r\n\r\nBut who shall presume to measure the abyss that lies between the\r\nIntention and the Execution? Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s resolution to speak was as firmly\r\nsettled as a resolution could be. And what came of it? Alas for human\r\ninfirmity! Nothing came of it but silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t look quite at your ease, Mr. Brinkworth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nhas Sir Patrick been saying to you? My uncle sharpens his wit on every\r\nbody. He has been sharpening it on _you?\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nArnold began to see his way. At an immeasurable distance--but still he\r\nsaw it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick is a terrible old man,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cJust before you\r\ncame in he discovered one of my secrets by only looking in my face.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\npaused, rallied his courage, pushed on at all hazards, and came headlong\r\nto the point. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, bluntly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether you take after\r\nyour uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche instantly understood him. With time at her disposal, she would\r\nhave taken him lightly in hand, and led him, by fine gradations, to the\r\nobject in view. But in two minutes or less it would be Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s turn to\r\nplay. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is going to make me an offer,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Blanche; \xe2\x80\x9cand he has\r\nabout a minute to do it in. He _shall_ do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think the gift of discovery runs in the\r\nfamily?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold made a plunge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish it did!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nBlanche looked the picture of astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you could see in my face what Sir Patrick saw--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had only to finish the sentence, and the thing was done. But the\r\ntender passion perversely delights in raising obstacles to itself. A\r\nsudden timidity seized on Arnold exactly at the wrong moment. He stopped\r\nshort, in the most awkward manner possible.\r\n\r\nBlanche heard from the lawn the blow of the mallet on the ball, and the\r\nlaughter of the company at some blunder of Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s. The precious\r\nseconds were slipping away. She could have boxed Arnold on both ears for\r\nbeing so unreasonably afraid of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cif I did look in your face, what should\r\nI see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold made another plunge. He answered: \xe2\x80\x9cYou would see that I want a\r\nlittle encouragement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom _me?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche looked back over her shoulder. The summer-house stood on an\r\neminence, approached by steps. The players on the lawn beneath were\r\naudible, but not visible. Any one of them might appear, unexpectedly, at\r\na moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice. Blanche listened. There was no sound of approaching\r\nfootsteps--there was a general hush, and then another bang of the mallet\r\non the ball and then a clapping of hands. Sir Patrick was a privileged\r\nperson. He had been allowed, in all probability, to try again; and he\r\nwas succeeding at the second effort. This implied a reprieve of some\r\nseconds. Blanche looked back again at Arnold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider yourself encouraged,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered; and instantly added, with\r\nthe ineradicable female instinct of self-defense, \xe2\x80\x9cwithin limits!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold made a last plunge--straight to the bottom, this time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider yourself loved,\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout any limits at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was all over--the words were spoken--he had got her by the hand.\r\nAgain the perversity of the tender passion showed itself more strongly\r\nthan ever. The confession which Blanche had been longing to hear, had\r\nbarely escaped her lover\xe2\x80\x99s lips before Blanche protested against it! She\r\nstruggled to release her hand. She formally appealed to Arnold to let\r\nher go.\r\n\r\nArnold only held her the tighter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo try to like me a little!\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cI am so fond of _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWho was to resist such wooing as this?--when you were privately fond of\r\nhim yourself, remember, and when you were certain to be interrupted in\r\nanother moment! Blanche left off struggling, and looked up at her young\r\nsailor with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you learn this method of making love in the merchant-service?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ninquired, saucily.\r\n\r\nArnold persisted in contemplating his prospects from the serious point\r\nof view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go back to the merchant-service,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif I have made you\r\nangry with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche administered another dose of encouragement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnger, Mr. Brinkworth, is one of the bad passions,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered,\r\ndemurely. \xe2\x80\x9cA young lady who has been properly brought up has no bad\r\npassions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden cry from the players on the lawn--a cry for \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nBrinkworth.\xe2\x80\x9d Blanche tried to push him out. Arnold was immovable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay something to encourage me before I go,\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cOne word will\r\ndo. Say, Yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche shook her head. Now she had got him, the temptation to tease him\r\nwas irresistible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want any more encouragement,\r\nyou must speak to my uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll speak to him,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Arnold, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore I leave the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another cry for \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Brinkworth.\xe2\x80\x9d Blanche made another effort\r\nto push him out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd mind you get through the hoop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had both hands on his shoulders--her face was close to his--she was\r\nsimply irresistible. Arnold caught her round the waist and kissed her.\r\nNeedless to tell him to get through the hoop. He had surely got through\r\nit already! Blanche was speechless. Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s last effort in the art of\r\ncourtship had taken away her breath. Before she could recover herself a\r\nsound of approaching footsteps became plainly audible. Arnold gave her a\r\nlast squeeze, and ran out.\r\n\r\nShe sank on the nearest chair, and closed her eyes in a flutter of\r\ndelicious confusion.\r\n\r\nThe footsteps ascending to the summer-house came nearer. Blanche opened\r\nher eyes, and saw Anne Silvester, standing alone, looking at her. She\r\nsprang to her feet, and threw her arms impulsively round Anne\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what has happened,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cWish me joy,\r\ndarling. He has said the words. He is mine for life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the sisterly love and sisterly confidence of many years was\r\nexpressed in that embrace, and in the tone in which the words were\r\nspoken. The hearts of the mothers, in the past time, could hardly\r\nhave been closer to each other--as it seemed--than the hearts of the\r\ndaughters were now. And yet, if Blanche had looked up in Anne\xe2\x80\x99s face at\r\nthat moment, she must have seen that Anne\xe2\x80\x99s mind was far away from her\r\nlittle love-story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know who it is?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, after waiting for a reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Brinkworth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course! Who else should it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are really happy, my love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappy?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Blanche \xe2\x80\x9cMind! this is strictly between ourselves. I\r\nam ready to jump out of my skin for joy. I love him! I love him! I love\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, with a childish pleasure in repeating the words. They\r\nwere echoed by a heavy sigh. Blanche instantly looked up into Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with a sudden change of voice and\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s observation saw too plainly to be blinded in that way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere _is_ something the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it money?\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\r\nafter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s consideration. \xe2\x80\x9cBills to pay? I have got plenty of\r\nmoney, Anne. I\xe2\x80\x99ll lend you what you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche drew back, a little hurt. Anne was keeping her at a distance for\r\nthe first time in Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s experience of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you all my secrets,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are _you_ keeping a secret\r\nfrom _me?_ Do you know that you have been looking anxious and out of\r\nspirits for some time past? Perhaps you don\xe2\x80\x99t like Mr. Brinkworth? No?\r\nyou _do_ like him? Is it my marrying, then? I believe it is! You fancy\r\nwe shall be parted, you goose? As if I could do without you! Of course,\r\nwhen I am married to Arnold, you will come and live with us. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquite understood between us--isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne drew herself suddenly, almost roughly, away from Blanche, and\r\npointed out to the steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is somebody coming,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe person coming was Arnold. It was Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s turn to play, and he had\r\nvolunteered to fetch her.\r\n\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s attention--easily enough distracted on other\r\noccasions--remained steadily fixed on Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I must know the reason of it. I\r\nwill wait till to-night; and then you will tell me, when you come into\r\nmy room. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look like that! You _shall_ tell me. And there\xe2\x80\x99s a kiss\r\nfor you in the mean time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe joined Arnold, and recovered her gayety the moment she looked at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? Have you got through the hoops?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind the hoops. I have broken the ice with Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! before all the company!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not! I have made an appointment to speak to him here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went laughing down the steps, and joined the game.\r\n\r\nLeft alone, Anne Silvester walked slowly to the inner and darker part of\r\nthe summer-house. A glass, in a carved wooden frame, was fixed\r\nagainst one of the side walls. She stopped and looked into it--looked,\r\nshuddering, at the reflection of herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the time coming,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen even Blanche will see what I am in\r\nmy face?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned aside from the glass. With a sudden cry of despair she flung\r\nup her arms and laid them heavily against the wall, and rested her head\r\non them with her back to the light. At the same moment a man\xe2\x80\x99s figure\r\nappeared--standing dark in the flood of sunshine at the entrance to the\r\nsummer-house. The man was Geoffrey Delamayn.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FOURTH.\r\n\r\nTHE TWO.\r\n\r\nHe advanced a few steps, and stopped. Absorbed in herself, Anne failed\r\nto hear him. She never moved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come, as you made a point of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sullenly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, mind\r\nyou, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the sound of his voice, Anne turned toward him. A change of\r\nexpression appeared in her face, as she slowly advanced from the back\r\nof the summer-house, which revealed a likeness to her moth er, not\r\nperceivable at other times. As the mother had looked, in by-gone days,\r\nat the man who had disowned her, so the daughter looked at Geoffrey\r\nDelamayn--with the same terrible composure, and the same terrible\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you got to say to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Delamayn,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are one of the fortunate people of\r\nthis world. You are a nobleman\xe2\x80\x99s son. You are a handsome man. You are\r\npopular at your college. You are free of the best houses in England.\r\nAre you something besides all this? Are you a coward and a scoundrel as\r\nwell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe started--opened his lips to speak--checked himself--and made an\r\nuneasy attempt to laugh it off. \xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ckeep your temper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe suppressed passion in her began to force its way to the surface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep my temper?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cDo _you_ of all men expect me to\r\ncontrol myself? What a memory yours must be! Have you forgotten the time\r\nwhen I was fool enough to think you were fond of me? and mad enough to\r\nbelieve you could keep a promise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe persisted in trying to laugh it off. \xe2\x80\x9cMad is a strongish word to use,\r\nMiss Silvester!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMad is the right word! I look back at my own infatuation--and I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\naccount for it; I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand myself. What was there in _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she asked, with an outbreak of contemptuous surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cto attract such a\r\nwoman as I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis inexhaustible good-nature was proof even against this. He put his\r\nhands in his pockets, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned away from him. The frank brutality of the answer had not\r\noffended her. It forced her, cruelly forced her, to remember that she\r\nhad nobody but herself to blame for the position in which she stood at\r\nthat moment. She was unwilling to let him see how the remembrance\r\nhurt her--that was all. A sad, sad story; but it must be told. In her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s time she had been the sweetest, the most lovable of children.\r\nIn later days, under the care of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s friend, her girlhood\r\nhad passed so harmlessly and so happily--it seemed as if the sleeping\r\npassions might sleep forever! She had lived on to the prime of her\r\nwomanhood--and then, when the treasure of her life was at its richest,\r\nin one fatal moment she had flung it away on the man in whose presence\r\nshe now stood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWas she without excuse? No: not utterly without excuse.\r\n\r\nShe had seen him under other aspects than the aspect which he presented\r\nnow. She had seen him, the hero of the river-race, the first and\r\nforemost man in a trial of strength and skill which had roused the\r\nenthusiasm of all England. She had seen him, the central object of the\r\ninterest of a nation; the idol of the popular worship and the popular\r\napplause. _His_ were the arms whose muscle was celebrated in the\r\nnewspapers. _He_ was first among the heroes hailed by ten thousand\r\nroaring throats as the pride and flower of England. A woman, in an\r\natmosphere of red-hot enthusiasm, witnesses the apotheosis of Physical\r\nStrength. Is it reasonable--is it just--to expect her to ask herself,\r\nin cold blood, What (morally and intellectually) is all this worth?--and\r\nthat, when the man who is the object of the apotheosis, notices her, is\r\npresented to her, finds her to his taste, and singles her out from the\r\nrest? No. While humanity is humanity, the woman is not utterly without\r\nexcuse.\r\n\r\nHas she escaped, without suffering for it?\r\n\r\nLook at her as she stands there, tortured by the knowledge of her own\r\nsecret--the hideous secret which she is hiding from the innocent girl,\r\nwhom she loves with a sister\xe2\x80\x99s love. Look at her, bowed down under a\r\nhumiliation which is unutterable in words. She has seen him below the\r\nsurface--now, when it is too late. She rates him at his true value--now,\r\nwhen her reputation is at his mercy. Ask her the question: What was\r\nthere to love in a man who can speak to you as that man has spoken,\r\nwho can treat you as that man is treating you now? you so clever, so\r\ncultivated, so refined--what, in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name, could _you_ see in him?\r\nAsk her that, and she will have no answer to give. She will not even\r\nremind you that he was once your model of manly beauty, too--that you\r\nwaved your handkerchief till you could wave it no longer, when he took\r\nhis seat, with the others, in the boat--that your heart was like to jump\r\nout of your bosom, on that later occasion when he leaped the last\r\nhurdle at the foot-race, and won it by a head. In the bitterness of her\r\nremorse, she will not even seek for _that_ excuse for herself. Is there\r\nno atoning suffering to be seen here? Do your sympathies shrink from\r\nsuch a character as this? Follow her, good friends of virtue, on the\r\npilgrimage that leads, by steep and thorny ways, to the purer atmosphere\r\nand the nobler life. Your fellow-creature, who has sinned and has\r\nrepented--you have the authority of the Divine Teacher for it--is\r\nyour fellow-creature, purified and ennobled. A joy among the angels of\r\nheaven--oh, my brothers and sisters of the earth, have I not laid my\r\nhand on a fit companion for You?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence in the summer-house. The cheerful tumult\r\nof the lawn-party was pleasantly audible from the distance. Outside, the\r\nhum of voices, the laughter of girls, the thump of the croquet-mallet\r\nagainst the ball. Inside, nothing but a woman forcing back the bitter\r\ntears of sorrow and shame--and a man who was tired of her.\r\n\r\nShe roused herself. She was her mother\xe2\x80\x99s daughter; and she had a\r\nspark of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s spirit. Her life depended on the issue of that\r\ninterview. It was useless--without father or brother to take her\r\npart--to lose the last chance of appealing to him. She dashed away\r\nthe tears--time enough to cry, is time easily found in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexistence--she dashed away the tears, and spoke to him again, more\r\ngently than she had spoken yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been three weeks, Geoffrey, at your brother Julius\xe2\x80\x99s place,\r\nnot ten miles from here; and you have never once ridden over to see me.\r\nYou would not have come to-day, if I had not written to you to insist on\r\nit. Is that the treatment I have deserved?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused. There was no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, advancing and speaking in louder tones.\r\n\r\nHe was still silent. It was not in human endurance to bear his contempt.\r\nThe warning of a coming outbreak began to show itself in her face. He\r\nmet it, beforehand, with an impenetrable front. Feeling nervous about\r\nthe interview, while he was waiting in the rose-garden--now that he\r\nstood committed to it, he was in full possession of himself. He\r\nwas composed enough to remember that he had not put his pipe in its\r\ncase--composed enough to set that little matter right before other\r\nmatters went any farther. He took the case out of one pocket, and the\r\npipe out of another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI hear you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe struck the pipe out of his hand at a blow. If she had had the\r\nstrength she would have struck him down with it on the floor of the\r\nsummer-house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you use me in this way?\xe2\x80\x9d she burst out, vehemently. \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nconduct is infamous. Defend it if you can!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no attempt to defend it. He looked, with an expression of\r\ngenuine anxiety, at the fallen pipe. It was beautifully colored--it had\r\ncost him ten shillings. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pick up my pipe first,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. His face\r\nbrightened pleasantly--he looked handsomer than ever--as he examined the\r\nprecious object, and put it back in the case. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cShe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t broken it.\xe2\x80\x9d His attitude as he looked at her again,\r\nwas the perfection of easy grace--the grace that attends on cultivated\r\nstrength in a state of repose. \xe2\x80\x9cI put it to your own common-sense,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, in the most reasonable manner, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of bullying me?\r\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t want them to hear you, out on the lawn there--do you? You\r\nwomen are all alike. There\xe2\x80\x99s no beating a little prudence into your\r\nheads, try how one may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere he waited, expecting her to speak. She waited, on her side, and\r\nforced him to go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no need to quarrel, you know. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to break my promise; but what can I do? I\xe2\x80\x99m not the eldest son.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m dependent on my father for every farthing I have; and I\xe2\x80\x99m on bad\r\nterms with him already. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you see it yourself? You\xe2\x80\x99re a lady, and\r\nall that, I know. But you\xe2\x80\x99re only a governess. It\xe2\x80\x99s your interest as\r\nwell as mine to wait till my father has provided for me. Here it is in a\r\nnut-shell: if I marry you now, I\xe2\x80\x99m a ruined man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe answer came, this time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou villain if you _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ marry me, I am a ruined woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what I mean. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me in that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you expect me to look at a woman who calls me a villain to my\r\nface?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe suddenly changed her tone. The savage element in humanity--let the\r\nmodern optimists who doubt its existence look at any uncultivated man\r\n(no matter how muscular), woman (no matter how beautiful), or child (no\r\nmatter how young)--began to show itself furtively in his eyes, to utter\r\nitself furtively in his voice. Was he to blame for the manner in which\r\nhe looked at her and spoke to her? Not he! What had there been in the\r\ntraining of _his_ life (at school or at college) to soften and subdue\r\nthe savage element in him? About as much as there had been in the\r\ntraining of his ancestors (without the school or the college) five\r\nhundred years since.\r\n\r\nIt was plain that one of them must give way. The woman had the most at\r\nstake--and the woman set the example of submission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be hard on me,\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be hard on _you._\r\nMy temper gets the better of me. You know my temper. I am sorry I forgot\r\nmyself. Geoffrey, my whole future is in your hands. Will you do me\r\njustice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe came nearer, and laid her hand persuasively on his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you a word to say to me? No answer? Not even a look?\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nwaited a moment more. A marked change came over her. She turned slowly\r\nto leave the summer-house. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to have troubled you, Mr.\r\nDelamayn. I won\xe2\x80\x99t detain you any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her. There was a tone in her voice that he had never heard\r\nbefore. There was a light in her eyes that he had never seen in them\r\nbefore. Suddenly and fiercely he reached out his hand, and stopped her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nShe answered, looking him straight in the face, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere many a miserable\r\nwoman has gone before me. Out of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew her nearer to him, and eyed her closely. Even _his_ intelligence\r\ndiscovered that he had brought her to bay, and that she really meant it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean you will destroy yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I mean I will destroy myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dropped her arm. \xe2\x80\x9cBy Jupiter, she _does_ mean it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that conviction in him, he pushed one of the chairs in the\r\nsummer-house to her with his foot, and signed to her to take it. \xe2\x80\x9cSit\r\ndown!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, roughly. She had frightened him--and fear comes seldom\r\nto men of his type. They feel it, when it does come, with an angry\r\ndistrust; they grow loud and brutal, in instinctive protest against it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. She obeyed him. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you got a word to say\r\nto me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, with an oath. No! there she sat, immovable, reckless\r\nhow it ended--as only women can be, when women\xe2\x80\x99s minds are made up.\r\nHe took a turn in the summer-house and came back, and struck his hand\r\nangrily on the rail of her chair. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what I want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took another turn. There was nothing for it but to give way on\r\nhis side, or run the risk of something happening which might cause an\r\nawkward scandal, and come to his father\xe2\x80\x99s ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cI have got something to\r\npropose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say to a private marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout asking a single question, without making objections, she\r\nanswered him, speaking as bluntly as he had spoken himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI consent to a private marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe began to temporize directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI own I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how it\xe2\x80\x99s to be managed--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped him there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried out, suspiciously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have thought of it yourself,\r\nhave you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd planned for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd planned for it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me so before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered haughtily; insisting on the respect which is due to\r\nwomen--the respect which was doubly due from _him,_ in her position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause _you_ owed it to _me,_ Sir, to speak first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken first. Will you wait a little?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone was positive. There was no mistaking it. Her mind was made up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the hurry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you eyes?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, vehemently. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you ears? Do you see how\r\nLady Lundie looks at me? Do you hear how Lady Lundie speaks to me? I am\r\nsuspected by that woman. My shameful dismissal from this house may be\r\na question of a few hours.\xe2\x80\x9d Her head sunk on her bosom; she wrung her\r\nclasped hands as they rested on her lap. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, oh, Blanche!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nmoaned to herself, the tears gathering again, and falling, this time,\r\nunchecked. \xe2\x80\x9cBlanche, who looks up to me! Blanche, who loves me! Blanche,\r\nwho told me, in this very place, that I was to live with her when she\r\nwas married!\xe2\x80\x9d She started up from the chair; the tears dried suddenly;\r\nthe hard despair settled again, wan and white, on her face. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me\r\ngo! What is death, compared to such a life as is waiting for _me?_\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nlooked him over, in one disdainful glance from head to foot; her voice\r\nrose to its loudest and firmest tones. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, even _you_; would have the\r\ncourage to die if you were in my place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey glanced round toward the lawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey will hear you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet them hear me! When _I_ am past hearing _them_, what does it\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put her back by main force on the chair. In another moment they must\r\nhave heard her, through all the noise and laughter of the game.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay what you want,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it. Only be reasonable. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t marry you to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense you talk! The house and grounds are swarming with\r\ncompany. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can! I have been thinking about it ever since we came to this house.\r\nI have got something to propose to you. Will you hear it, or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak lower!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you hear it, or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s somebody coming!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you hear it, or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil take your obstinacy! Yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe answer had been wrung from him. Still, it was the answer she\r\nwanted--it opened the door to hope. The instant he had consented to hear\r\nher her mind awakened to the serious necessity of averting discovery by\r\nany third person who might stray idly into the summer-house. She held\r\nup her hand for silence, and listened to what was going forward on the\r\nlawn.\r\n\r\nThe dull thump of the croquet-mallet against the ball was no longer to\r\nbe heard. The game had stopped.\r\n\r\nIn a moment more she heard her own name called. An interval of another\r\ninstant passed, and a familiar voice said, \xe2\x80\x9cI know where she is. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nfetch her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned to Geoffrey, and pointed to the back of the summer-house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my turn to play,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Blanche is coming here to look\r\nfor me. Wait there, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop her on the steps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went out at once. It was a critical moment. Discovery, which meant\r\nmoral-ruin to the woman, meant money-ruin to the man. Geoffrey had not\r\nexaggerated his position with his father. Lord Holchester had twice paid\r\nhis debts, and had declined to see him since. One more outrage on his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s rigid sense of propriety, and he would be left out of the will\r\nas well as kept out of the house. He looked for a means of retreat,\r\nin case there was no escaping unperceived by the front entrance.\r\nA door--intended for the use of servants, when picnics and gipsy\r\ntea-parties were given in the summer-house--had been made in the back\r\nwall. It opened outward, and it was locked. With his strength it was\r\neasy to remove that obstacle. He put his shoulder to the door. At the\r\nmoment when he burst it open he felt a hand on his arm. Anne was behind\r\nhim, alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may want it before long,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, observing the open door,\r\nwithout expressing any surprise, \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t want it now. Another person\r\nwill play for me--I have told Blanche I am not well. Sit down. I have\r\nsecured a respite of five minutes, and I must make the most of it. In\r\nthat time, or less, Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions will bring her here--to see\r\nhow I am. For the present, shut the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seated herself, and pointed to a second chair. He took it--with his\r\neye on the closed door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome to the point!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can marry me privately to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cLis ten--and I will\r\ntell you how!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIFTH.\r\n\r\nTHE PLAN.\r\n\r\nSHE took his hand, and began with all the art of persuasion that she\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne question, Geoffrey, before I say what I want to say. Lady Lundie\r\nhas invited you to stay at Windygates. Do you accept her invitation? or\r\ndo you go back to your brother\xe2\x80\x99s in the evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go back in the evening--they\xe2\x80\x99ve put a visitor into my room. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nobliged to stay here. My brother has done it on purpose. Julius helps me\r\nwhen I\xe2\x80\x99m hard up--and bullies me afterward. He has sent me here, on\r\nduty for the family. Somebody must be civil to Lady Lundie--and I\xe2\x80\x99m the\r\nsacrifice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took him up at his last word. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make the sacrifice,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApologize to Lady Lundie, and say you are obliged to go back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause we must both leave this place to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a double objection to that. If he left Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s, he would\r\nfail to establish a future pecuniary claim on his brother\xe2\x80\x99s indulgence.\r\nAnd if he left with Anne, the eyes of the world would see them, and the\r\nwhispers of the world might come to his father\xe2\x80\x99s ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we go away together,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cgood-by to my prospects, and yours\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we shall leave together,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will\r\nleave separately--and I will go first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be a hue and cry after you, when you are missed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be a dance when the croquet is over. I don\xe2\x80\x99t dance--and I\r\nshall not be missed. There will be time, and opportunity to get to\r\nmy own room. I shall leave a letter there for Lady Lundie, and a\r\nletter\xe2\x80\x9d--her voice trembled for a moment--\xe2\x80\x9cand a letter for Blanche.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt me! I have thought of this, as I have thought of every\r\nthing else. The confession I shall make will be the truth in a few\r\nhours, if it\xe2\x80\x99s not the truth now. My letters will say I am privately\r\nmarried, and called away unexpectedly to join my husband. There will be\r\na scandal in the house, I know. But there will be no excuse for sending\r\nafter me, when I am under my husband\xe2\x80\x99s protection. So far as you are\r\npersonally concerned there are no discoveries to fear--and nothing which\r\nit is not perfectly safe and perfectly easy to do. Wait here an hour\r\nafter I have gone to save appearances; and then follow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFollow you?\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d She drew her chair nearer to\r\nhim, and whispered the next words in his ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo a lonely little mountain inn--four miles from this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn inn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn inn is a public place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA movement of natural impatience escaped her--but she controlled\r\nherself, and went on as quietly as before:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe place I mean is the loneliest place in the neighborhood. You have\r\nno prying eyes to dread there. I have picked it out expressly for that\r\nreason. It\xe2\x80\x99s away from the railway; it\xe2\x80\x99s away from the high-road: it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkept by a decent, respectable Scotchwoman--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecent, respectable Scotchwomen who keep inns,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Geoffrey,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t cotton to young ladies who are traveling alone. The landlady\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t receive you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a well-aimed objection--but it missed the mark. A woman bent on\r\nher marriage is a woman who can meet the objections of the whole world,\r\nsingle-handed, and refute them all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have provided for every thing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have provided for\r\nthat. I shall tell the landlady I am on my wedding-trip. I shall say\r\nmy husband is sight-seeing, on foot, among the mountains in the\r\nneighborhood--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is sure to believe that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is sure to _dis_believe it, if you like. Let her! You have only\r\nto appear, and to ask for your wife--and there is my story proved to be\r\ntrue! She may be the most suspicious woman living, as long as I am alone\r\nwith her. The moment you join me, you set her suspicions at rest. Leave\r\nme to do my part. My part is the hard one. Will you do yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to say No: she had fairly cut the ground from under\r\nhis feet. He shifted his ground. Any thing rather than say Yes!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose _you_ know how we are to be married?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I can\r\nsay is--_I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do!\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know that we are in Scotland. You know that\r\nthere are neither forms, ceremonies, nor delays in marriage, here. The\r\nplan I have proposed to you secures my being received at the inn, and\r\nmakes it easy and natural for you to join me there afterward. The\r\nrest is in our own hands. A man and a woman who wish to be married (in\r\nScotland) have only to secure the necessary witnesses and the thing is\r\ndone. If the landlady chooses to resent the deception practiced on her,\r\nafter that, the landlady may do as she pleases. We shall have gained\r\nour object in spite of her--and, what is more, we shall have gained it\r\nwithout risk to _you._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t lay it all on my shoulders,\xe2\x80\x9d Geoffrey rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cYou women\r\ngo headlong at every thing. Say we are married. We must separate\r\nafterward--or how are we to keep it a secret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. You will go back, of course, to your brother\xe2\x80\x99s house, as if\r\nnothing had happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is to become of _you?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall go to London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you to do in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I already told you that I have thought of every thing? When I\r\nget to London I shall apply to some of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s old friends--friends\r\nof hers in the time when she was a musician. Every body tells me I have\r\na voice--if I had only cultivated it. I _will_ cultivate it! I can live,\r\nand live respectably, as a concert singer. I have saved money enough to\r\nsupport me, while I am learning--and my mother\xe2\x80\x99s friends will help me,\r\nfor her sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, in the new life that she was marking out, was she now unconsciously\r\nreflecting in herself the life of her mother before her. Here was the\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s career as a public singer, chosen (in spite of all efforts to\r\nprevent it) by the child! Here (though with other motives, and under\r\nother circumstances) was the mother\xe2\x80\x99s irregular marriage in Ireland,\r\non the point of being followed by the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s irregular marriage in\r\nScotland! And here, stranger still, was the man who was answerable for\r\nit--the son of the man who had found the flaw in the Irish marriage, and\r\nhad shown the way by which her mother was thrown on the world! \xe2\x80\x9cMy Anne\r\nis my second self. She is not called by her father\xe2\x80\x99s name; she is called\r\nby mine. She is Anne Silvester as I was. Will she end like Me?\xe2\x80\x9d--The\r\nanswer to those words--the last words that had trembled on the dying\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s lips--was coming fast. Through the chances and changes of many\r\nyears, the future was pressing near--and Anne Silvester stood on the\r\nbrink of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you at the end of your objections? Can you\r\ngive me a plain answer at last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo! He had another objection ready as the words passed her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose the witnesses at the inn happen to know me?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose\r\nit comes to my father\xe2\x80\x99s ears in that way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you drive me to my death?\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted, starting to her feet.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father shall know the truth, in that case--I swear it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose, on his side, and drew back from her. She followed him up. There\r\nwas a clapping of hands, at the same moment, on the lawn. Somebody had\r\nevidently made a brilliant stroke which promised to decide the game.\r\nThere was no security now that Blanche might not return again. There\r\nwas every prospect, the game being over, that Lady Lundie would be free.\r\nAnne brought the interview to its crisis, without wasting a moment more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Geoffrey Delamayn,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have bargained for a private\r\nmarriage, and I have consented. Are you, or are you not, ready to marry\r\nme on your own terms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me a minute to think!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot an instant. Once for all, is it Yes, or No?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d even then. But he said what was equivalent to it.\r\nHe asked, savagely, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the inn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put her arm in his, and whispered, rapidly, \xe2\x80\x9cPass the road on the\r\nright that leads to the railway. Follow the path over the moor, and the\r\nsheep-track up the hill. The first house you come to after that is the\r\ninn. You understand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded his head, with a sullen frown, and took his pipe out of his\r\npocket again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet it alone this time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, meeting her eye. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mind\xe2\x80\x99s upset.\r\nWhen a man\xe2\x80\x99s mind\xe2\x80\x99s upset, a man can\xe2\x80\x99t smoke. What\xe2\x80\x99s the name of the\r\nplace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCraig Fernie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho am I to ask for at the door?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor your wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose they want you to give your name when you get there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I must give a name, I shall call myself Mrs., instead of Miss,\r\nSilvester. But I shall do my best to avoid giving any name. And you will\r\ndo your best to avoid making a mistake, by only asking for me as your\r\nwife. Is there any thing else you want to know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe quick about it! What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow am I to know you have got away from here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t hear from me in half an hour from the time when I have\r\nleft you, you may be sure I have got away. Hush!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo voices, in conversation, were audible at the bottom of the\r\nsteps--Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s voice and Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s. Anne pointed to the door\r\nin the back wall of the summer-house. She had just pulled it to again,\r\nafter Geoffrey had passed through it, when Lady Lundie and Sir Patrick\r\nappeared at the top of the steps.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SIXTH.\r\n\r\nTHE SUITOR.\r\n\r\nLADY LUNDIE pointed significantly to the door, and addressed herself to\r\nSir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s private ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObserve!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Silvester has just got rid of somebody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick deliberately looked in the wrong direction, and (in the\r\npolitest possible manner) observed--nothing.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie advanced into the summer-house. Suspicious hatred of the\r\ngoverness was written legibly in every line of her face. Suspicious\r\ndistrust of the governess\xe2\x80\x99s illness spoke plainly in every tone of her\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I inquire, Miss Silvester, if your sufferings are relieved?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am no better, Lady Lundie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said I was no better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou appear to be able to stand up. When _I_ am ill, I am not so\r\nfortunate. I am obliged to lie down.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will follow your example, Lady Lundie. If you will be so good as to\r\nexcuse me, I will leave you, and lie down in my own room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could say no more. The interview with Geoffrey had worn her out;\r\nthere was no spirit left in her to resist the petty malice of the woman,\r\nafter bearing, as she had borne it, the brutish indifference of the man.\r\nIn another moment the hysterical suffering which she was keeping down\r\nwould have forced its way outward in tears. Without waiting to know\r\nwhether she was excused or not, without stopping to hear a word more,\r\nshe left the summer-house.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s magnificent black eyes opened to their utmost width, and\r\nblazed with their most dazzling brightness. She appealed to Sir Patrick,\r\npoised easily on his ivory cane, and looking out at the lawn-party, the\r\npicture of venerable innocence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter what I have already told you, Sir Patrick, of Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconduct, may I ask whether you consider _that_ proceeding at all\r\nextraordinary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman touched the spring in the knob of his cane, and\r\nanswered, in the courtly manner of the old school:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI consider no proceeding extraordinary Lady Lundie, which emanates from\r\nyour enchanting sex.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bowed, and took his pinch. With a little jaunty flourish of the hand,\r\nhe dusted the stray grains of snuff off his finger and thumb, and looked\r\nback again at the lawn-party, and became more absorbed in the diversions\r\nof his young friends than ever.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie stood her ground, plainly determined to force a serious\r\nexpression of opinion from her brother-in-law. Before she could speak\r\nagain, Arnold and Blanche appeared together at the bottom of the steps.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when does the dancing begin?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Sir Patrick, advancing to\r\nmeet them, and looking as if he felt the deepest interest in a speedy\r\nsettlement of the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very thing I was going to ask mamma,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cIs she in\r\nthere with Anne? Is Anne better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie forthwith appeared, and took the answer to that inquiry on\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Silvester has retired to her room. Miss Silvester persists in\r\nbeing ill. Have you noticed, Sir Patrick, that these half-bred sort of\r\npeople are almost invariably rude when they are ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s bright face flushed up. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you think Anne a half-bred person,\r\nLady Lundie, you stand alone in your opinion. My uncle doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree\r\nwith you, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the first quadrille became almost painful to\r\nsee. \xe2\x80\x9c_Do_ tell me, my dear, when _is_ the dancing going to begin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sooner the better,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Lady Lundie; \xe2\x80\x9cbefore Blanche picks\r\nanother quarrel with me on the subject of Miss Silvester.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche looked at her uncle. \xe2\x80\x9cBegin! begin! Don\xe2\x80\x99t lose time!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\nardent Sir Patrick, pointing toward the house with his cane. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\r\nuncle! Any thing that _you_ wish!\xe2\x80\x9d With that parting shot at her\r\nstep-mother, Blanche withdrew. Arnold, who had thus far waited in\r\nsilence at the foot of the steps, looked appealingly at Sir Patrick. The\r\ntrain which was to take him to his newly inherited property would start\r\nin less than an hour; and he had not presented himself to Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nguardian in the character of Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s suitor yet! Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nindifference to all domestic claims on him--claims of persons who\r\nloved, and claims of persons who hated, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter which--remained\r\nperfectly unassailable. There he stood, poised on his cane, humming an\r\nold Scotch air. And there was Lady Lundie, resolute not to leave him\r\ntill he had seen the governess with _her_ eyes and judged the governess\r\nwith _her_ mind. She returned to the charge--in spite of Sir Patrick,\r\nhumming at the top of the steps, and of Arnold, waiting at the bottom.\r\n(Her enemies said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder poor Sir Thomas died in a few months after\r\nhis marriage!\xe2\x80\x9d And, oh dear me, our enemies _are_ sometimes right!)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must once more remind you, Sir Patrick, that I have serious reason\r\nto doubt whether Miss Silvester is a fit companion for Blanche. My\r\ngoverness has something on her mind. She has fits of crying in private.\r\nShe is up and walking about her room when she ought to be asleep. She\r\nposts her own letters--_and,_ she has lately been excessively insolent\r\nto Me. There is something wrong. I must take some steps in the\r\nmatter--and it is only proper that I should do so with your sanction, as\r\nhead of the family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider me as abdicating my position, Lady Lundie, in your favor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick, I beg you to observe that I am speaking seriously, and\r\nthat I expect a serious reply.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good lady, ask me for any thing else and it is at your service. I\r\nhave not made a serious reply since I gave up practice at the\r\nScottish Bar. At my age,\xe2\x80\x9d added Sir Patrick, cunningly drifting into\r\ngeneralities, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing is serious--except Indigestion. I say, with the\r\nphilosopher, \xe2\x80\x98Life is a comedy to those who think, and tragedy to those\r\nwho feel.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d He took his sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and kissed it. \xe2\x80\x9cDear Lady\r\nLundie, why feel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie, who had never \xe2\x80\x9cfelt\xe2\x80\x9d in her life, appeared perversely\r\ndetermined to feel, on this occasion. She was offended--and she showed\r\nit plainly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you are next called on, Sir Patrick, to judge of Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconduct,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cunless I am entirely mistaken, you will find\r\nyourself _compelled_ to consider it as something beyond a joke.\xe2\x80\x9d With\r\nthose words, she walked out of the summer-house--and so forwarded\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s interests by leaving Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s guardian alone at last.\r\n\r\nIt was an excellent opportunity. The guests were safe in the\r\nhouse--there was no interruption to be feared, Arnold showed himself.\r\nSir Patrick (perfectly undisturbed by Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s parting speech) sat\r\ndown in the summer-house, without noticing his young friend, and asked\r\nhimself a question founded on profound observation of the female sex.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere there ever two women yet with a quarrel between them,\xe2\x80\x9d thought\r\nthe old gentleman, \xe2\x80\x9cwho didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to drag a man into it? Let them drag\r\n_me_ in, if they can!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold advanced a step, and modestly announced himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope I am not\r\nin the way, Sir Patrick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the way? of course not! Bless my soul, how serious the boy looks!\r\nAre _you_ going to appeal to me as the head of the family next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was exactly what Arnold was about to do. But it was plain that if he\r\nadmitted it just then Sir Patrick (for some unintelligible reason) would\r\ndecline to listen to him. He answered cautiously, \xe2\x80\x9cI asked leave to\r\nconsult you in private, Sir; and you kindly said you would give me the\r\nopportunity before I left Windygates?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! ay! to be sure. I remember. We were both engaged in the serious\r\nbusiness of croquet at the time--and it was doubtful which of us did\r\nthat business most clumsily. Well, here is the opportunity; and here\r\nam I, with all my worldly experience, at your service. I have only one\r\ncaution to give you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t appeal to me as \xe2\x80\x98the head of the family.\xe2\x80\x99 My\r\nresignation is in Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was, as usual, half in jest, half in earnest. The wry twist of humor\r\nshowed itself at the corners of his lips. Arnold was at a loss how to\r\napproach Sir Patrick on the subject of his niece without reminding him\r\nof his domestic responsibilities on the one hand, and without setting\r\nhimself up as a target for the shafts of Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s wit on the other.\r\nIn this difficulty, he committed a mistake at the outset. He hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t hurry yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cCollect your ideas. I can\r\nwait! I can wait!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold collected his ideas--and committed a second mistake. He\r\ndetermined on feeling his way cautiously at first. Under the\r\ncircumstances (and with such a man as he had now to deal with), it\r\nwas perhaps the rashest resolution at which he could possibly have\r\narrived--it was the mouse attempting to outmanoeuvre the cat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been very kind, Sir, in offering me the benefit of your\r\nexperience,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cI want a word of advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you take it sitting?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cGet a chair.\xe2\x80\x9d His\r\nsharp eyes followed Arnold with an expression of malicious enjoyment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWants my advice?\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cThe young humbug wants nothing of the\r\nsort--he wants my niece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold sat down under Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s eye, with a well-founded suspicion\r\nthat he was destined to suffer, before he got up again, under Sir\r\nPatrick\xe2\x80\x99s tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am only a young man,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, moving uneasily in his chair, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nI am beginning a new life--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny thing wrong with the chair?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cBegin your new\r\nlife comfortably, and get another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with the chair, Sir. Would you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould I keep the chair, in that case? Certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, would you advise me--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good fellow, I\xe2\x80\x99m waiting to advise you. (I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there\xe2\x80\x99s something\r\nwrong with that chair. Why be obstinate about it? Why not get another?)\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t notice the chair, Sir Patrick--you put me out. I want--in\r\nshort--perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s a curious question--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say till I have heard it,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\r\nwe will admit it, for form\xe2\x80\x99s sake, if you like. Say it\xe2\x80\x99s a curious\r\nquestion. Or let us express it more strongly, if that will help you.\r\nSay it\xe2\x80\x99s the most extraordinary question that ever was put, since the\r\nbeginning of the world, from one human being to another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s this!\xe2\x80\x9d Arnold burst out, desperately. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to be married!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat isn\xe2\x80\x99t a question,\xe2\x80\x9d objected Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an assertion. You\r\nsay, I want to be married. And I say, Just so! And there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s head began to whirl. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you advise me to get married, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said, piteously. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I meant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! That\xe2\x80\x99s the object of the present interview, is it? Would I advise\r\nyou to marry, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(Having caught the mouse by this time, the cat lifted his paw and\r\nlet the luckless little creature breathe again. Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s manner\r\nsuddenly freed itself from any slight signs of impatience which it might\r\nhave hitherto shown, and became as pleasantly easy and confidential as\r\na manner could be. He touched the knob of his cane, and helped himself,\r\nwith infinite zest and enjoyment, to a pinch of snuff.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould I advise you to marry?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo courses\r\nare open to us, Mr. Arnold, in treating that question. We may put it\r\nbriefly, or we may put it at great length. I am for putting it briefly.\r\nWhat do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you say, Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. May I begin by making an inquiry relating to your past\r\nlife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good again. When you were in the merchant service, did you ever\r\nhave any experience in buying provisions ashore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold stared. If any relation existed between that question and the\r\nsubject in hand it was an impenetrable relation to _him_. He answered,\r\nin unconcealed bewilderment, \xe2\x80\x9cPlenty of experience, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m coming to the point,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be astonished.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m coming to the point. What did you think of your moist sugar when you\r\nbought it at the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I thought it was moist sugar, to be\r\nsure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry, by all means!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are one of the few men\r\nwho can try that experiment with a fair chance of success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe suddenness of the answer fairly took away Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s breath. There was\r\nsomething perfectly electric in the brevity of his venerable friend. He\r\nstared harder than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you understand me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what the moist sugar has got to do with it, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t see that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick, crossing his legs, and setting\r\nin comfortably for a good talk \xe2\x80\x9cYou go to the tea-shop, and get your\r\nmoist sugar. You take it on the understanding that it is moist sugar.\r\nBut it isn\xe2\x80\x99t any thing of the sort. It\xe2\x80\x99s a compound of adulterations\r\nmade up to look like sugar. You shut your eyes to that awkward fact, and\r\nswallow your adulterated mess in various articles of food; and you and\r\nyour sugar get on together in that way as well as you can. Do you follow\r\nme, so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes. Arnold (quite in the dark) followed, so far.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cYou go to the marriage-shop, and\r\nget a wife. You take her on the understanding--let us say--that she\r\nhas lovely yellow hair, that she has an exquisite complexion, that her\r\nfigure is the perfection of plumpness, and that she is just tall enough\r\nto carry the plumpness off. You bring her home, and you discover that\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s the old story of the sugar over again. Your wife is an adulterated\r\narticle. Her lovely yellow hair is--dye. Her exquisite skin is--pearl\r\npowder. Her plumpness is--padding. And three inches of her height\r\nare--in the boot-maker\xe2\x80\x99s heels. Shut your eyes, and swallow your\r\nadulterated wife as you swallow your adulterated sugar--and, I tell you\r\nagain, you are one of the few men who can try the marriage experiment\r\nwith a fair chance of success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he uncrossed his legs again, and looked hard at Arnold. Arnold\r\nread the lesson, at last, in the right way. He gave up the hopeless\r\nattempt to circumvent Sir Patrick, and--come what might of it--dashed at\r\na direct allusion to Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s niece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be all very true, Sir, of some young ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nis one I know of, who is nearly related to you, and who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve\r\nwhat you have said of the rest of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was coming to the point. Sir Patrick showed his approval of\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s frankness by coming to the point himself, as readily as his own\r\nwhimsical humor would let him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this female phenomenon my niece?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask how you know that my niece is not an adulterated article,\r\nlike the rest of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s indignation loosened the last restraints that tied Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntongue. He exploded in the three words which mean three volumes in every\r\ncirculating library in the kingdom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick sat back in his chair, and stretched out his legs\r\nluxuriously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the most convincing answer I ever heard in my life,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in earnest!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Arnold, reckless by this time of every\r\nconsideration but one. \xe2\x80\x9cPut me to the test, Sir! put me to the test!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well. The test is easily put.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at Arnold, with the\r\nirrepressible humor twinkling merrily in his eyes, and twitching sharply\r\nat the corners of his lips. \xe2\x80\x9cMy niece has a beautiful complexion. Do you\r\nbelieve in her complexion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful sky above our heads,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe\r\nin the sky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were evidently never caught in a\r\nshower. My niece has an immense quantity of hair. Are you convinced that\r\nit all grows on her head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI defy any other woman\xe2\x80\x99s head to produce the like of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Arnold, you greatly underrate the existing resources of the\r\ntrade in hair! Look into the shop-windows. When you next go to London\r\npray look into the show-windows. In the mean time, what do you think of\r\nmy niece\xe2\x80\x99s figure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come! there can\xe2\x80\x99t be any doubt about _that!_ Any man, with eyes in\r\nhis head, can see it\xe2\x80\x99s the loveliest figure in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick laughed softly, and crossed his legs again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good fellow, of course it is! The loveliest figure in the world\r\nis the commonest thing in the world. At a rough guess, there are forty\r\nladies at this lawn-party. Every one of them possesses a beautiful\r\nfigure. It varies in price; and when it\xe2\x80\x99s particularly seductive you may\r\nswear it comes from Paris. Why, how you stare! When I asked you what you\r\nthought of my niece\xe2\x80\x99s figure, I meant--how much of it comes from Nature,\r\nand how much of it comes from the Shop? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, mind! Do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take my oath to every inch of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShop?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNature!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick rose to his feet; his satirical humor was silenced at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf ever I have a son,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cthat son shall go\r\nto sea!\xe2\x80\x9d He took Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s arm, as a preliminary to putting an end to\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s suspense. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I _can_ be serious about any thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s time to be serious with you. I am convinced of the sincerity of\r\nyour attachment. All I know of you is in your favor, and your birth and\r\nposition are beyond dispute. If you have Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s consent, you have\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x9d Arnold attempted to express his gratitude. Sir Patrick, declining\r\nto hear him, went on. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd remember this, in the future. When you next\r\nwant any thing that I can give you, ask for it plainly. Don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to\r\nmystify _me_ on the next occasion, and I will promise, on my side, not\r\nto mystify _you._ There, that\xe2\x80\x99s understood. Now about this journey of\r\nyours to see your estate. Property has its duties, Master Arnold, as\r\nwell as its rights. The time is fast coming when its rights will be\r\ndisputed, if its duties are not performed. I have got a new interest in\r\nyou, and I mean to see that you do your duty. It\xe2\x80\x99s settled you are to\r\nleave Windygates to-day. Is it arranged how you are to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir Patrick. Lady Lundie has kindly ordered the gig to take me to\r\nthe station, in time for the next train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you to be ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold looked at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cIn a quarter of an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. Mind you _are_ ready. Stop a minute! you will have plenty of\r\ntime to speak to Blanche when I have done with you. You don\xe2\x80\x99t appear to\r\nme to be sufficiently anxious about seeing your own property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not very anxious to leave Blanche, Sir--that\xe2\x80\x99s the truth of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind Blanche. Blanche is not business. They both begin with a\r\nB--and that\xe2\x80\x99s the only connection between them. I hear you have got one\r\nof the finest houses in this part of Scotland. How long are you going to\r\nstay in Scotland? How long are you going to stay in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have arranged (as I have already told you, Sir) to return to\r\nWindygates the day after to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Here is a man with a palace waiting to receive him--and he is\r\nonly going to stop one clear day in it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to stop in it at all, Sir Patrick--I am going to stay\r\nwith the steward. I\xe2\x80\x99m only wanted to be present to-morrow at a dinner\r\nto my tenants--and, when that\xe2\x80\x99s over, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in the world to\r\nprevent my coming back here. The steward himself told me so in his last\r\nletter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if the steward told you so, of course there is nothing more to be\r\nsaid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t object to my coming back! pray don\xe2\x80\x99t, Sir Patrick! I\xe2\x80\x99ll promise\r\nto live in my new house when I have got Blanche to live in it with me.\r\nIf you won\xe2\x80\x99t mind, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and tell her at once that it all belongs to\r\nher as well as to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently! gently! you talk as if you were married to her already!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s as good as done, Sir! Where\xe2\x80\x99s the difficulty in the way now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he asked the question the shadow of some third person, advancing\r\nfrom the side of the summer-house, was thrown forward on the open sunlit\r\nspace at the top of the steps. In a moment more the shadow was followed\r\nby the substance--in the shape of a groom in his riding livery. The man\r\nwas plainly a stranger to the place. He started, and touched his hat,\r\nwhen he saw the two gentlemen in the summer-house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sir Patrick\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Sir; I was sent by my master--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is your master?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Honorable Mr. Delamayn, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arnold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir. Mr. Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s brother--Mr. Julius. I have ridden over from\r\nthe house, Sir, with a message from my master to Mr. Geoffrey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you find him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey told me I should find him hereabouts, Sir. But I\xe2\x80\x99m a stranger, and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t rightly know where to look.\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped, and took a card out of\r\nhis pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cMy master said it was very important I should deliver this\r\nimmediately. Would you be pleased to tell me, gentlemen, if you happen\r\nto know where Mr. Geoffrey is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold turned to Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen him. Have you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have smelt him,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cever since I have been in\r\nthe summer-house. There is a detestable taint of tobacco in the\r\nair--suggestive (disagreeably suggestive to _my_ mind) of your friend,\r\nMr. Delamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold laughed, and stepped outside the summer-house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are right, Sir Patrick, we will find him at once.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked\r\naround, and shouted, \xe2\x80\x9cGeoffrey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA voice from the rose-garden shouted back, \xe2\x80\x9cHullo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re wanted. Come here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey appeared, sauntering doggedly, with his pipe in his mouth, and\r\nhis hands in his pockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho wants me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA groom--from your brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat answer appeared to electrify the lounging and lazy athlete.\r\nGeoffrey hurried, with eager steps, to the summer-house. He addressed\r\nthe groom before the man had time to speak With horror and dismay in his\r\nface, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jupiter! Ratcatcher has relapsed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick and Arnold looked at each other in blank amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe best horse in my brother\xe2\x80\x99s stables!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Geoffrey, explaining,\r\nand appealing to them, in a breath. \xe2\x80\x9cI left written directions with the\r\ncoachman, I measured out his physic for three days; I bled him,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGeoffrey, in a voice broken by emotion--\xe2\x80\x9cI bled him myself, last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Sir--\xe2\x80\x9d began the groom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use of begging my pardon? You\xe2\x80\x99re a pack of infernal\r\nfools! Where\xe2\x80\x99s your horse? I\xe2\x80\x99ll ride back, and break every bone in the\r\ncoachman\xe2\x80\x99s skin! Where\xe2\x80\x99s your horse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, Sir, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t Ratcatcher. Ratcatcher\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRatcatcher\xe2\x80\x99s all right? Then what the devil is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a message, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout my lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! About my father?\xe2\x80\x9d He took out his handkerchief, and passed it over\r\nhis forehead, with a deep gasp of relief. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was Ratcatcher,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said, looking at Arnold, with a smile. He put his pipe into his\r\nmouth, and rekindled the dying ashes of the tobacco. \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on,\r\nwhen the pipe was in working order, and his voice was composed again:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s up with my father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA telegram from London, Sir. Bad news of my lord.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man produced his master\xe2\x80\x99s card.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey read on it (written in his brother\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting) these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only a moment to scribble a line on my card. Our father is\r\ndangerously ill--his lawyer has been sent for. Come with me to London by\r\nthe first train. Meet at the junction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout a word to any one of the three persons present, all silently\r\nlooking at him, Geoffrey consulted his watch. Anne had told him to wait\r\nhalf an hour, and to assume that she had gone if he failed to hear from\r\nher in that time. The interval had passed--and no communication of\r\nany sort had reached him. The flight from the house had been safely\r\naccomplished. Anne Silvester was, at that moment, on her way to the\r\nmountain inn.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SEVENTH.\r\n\r\nTHE DEBT.\r\n\r\nARNOLD was the first who broke the silence. \xe2\x80\x9cIs your father seriously\r\nill?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey answered by handing him the card.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick, who had stood apart (while the question of Ratcatcher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrelapse was under discussion) sardonically studying the manners and\r\ncustoms of modern English youth, now came forward, and took his part\r\nin the proceedings. Lady Lundie herself must have acknowledged that he\r\nspoke and acted as became the head of the family, on t his occasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I right in supposing that Mr. Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s father is dangerously ill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he asked, addressing himself to Arnold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDangerously ill, in London,\xe2\x80\x9d Arnold answered. \xe2\x80\x9cGeoffrey must leave\r\nWindygates with me. The train I am traveling by meets the train his\r\nbrother is traveling by, at the junction. I shall leave him at the\r\nsecond station from here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me that Lady Lundie was going to send you to the\r\nrailway in a gig?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the servant drives, there will be three of you--and there will be no\r\nroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had better ask for some other vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Arnold.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick looked at his watch. There was no time to change the\r\ncarriage. He turned to Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you drive, Mr. Delamayn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill impenetrably silent, Geoffrey replied by a nod of the head.\r\n\r\nWithout noticing the unceremonious manner in which he had been answered,\r\nSir Patrick went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, you can leave the gig in charge of the station-master.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell the servant that he will not be wanted to drive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me save you the trouble, Sir Patrick,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick declined, by a gesture. He turned again, with undiminished\r\ncourtesy, to Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is one of the duties of hospitality, Mr.\r\nDelamayn, to hasten your departure, under these sad circumstances. Lady\r\nLundie is engaged with her guests. I will see myself that there is no\r\nunnecessary delay in sending you to the station.\xe2\x80\x9d He bowed--and left the\r\nsummer-house.\r\n\r\nArnold said a word of sympathy to his friend, when they were alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry for this, Geoffrey. I hope and trust you will get to London\r\nin time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped. There was something in Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s face--a strange mixture of\r\ndoubt and bewilderment, of annoyance and hesitation--which was not to\r\nbe accounted for as the natural result of the news that he had received.\r\nHis color shifted and changed; he picked fretfully at his finger-nails;\r\nhe looked at Arnold as if he was going to speak--and then looked away\r\nagain, in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there something amiss, Geoffrey, besides this bad news about your\r\nfather?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arnold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in the devil\xe2\x80\x99s own mess,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I do any thing to help you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of making a direct reply, Geoffrey lifted his mighty hand, and\r\ngave Arnold a friendly slap on the shoulder which shook him from head\r\nto foot. Arnold steadied himself, and waited--wondering what was coming\r\nnext.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, old fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember when the boat turned keel upward in Lisbon Harbor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold started. If he could have called to mind his first interview in\r\nthe summer-house with his father\xe2\x80\x99s old friend he might have remembered\r\nSir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s prediction that he would sooner or later pay, with\r\ninterest, the debt he owed to the man who had saved his life. As it was\r\nhis memory reverted at a bound to the time of the boat-accident. In\r\nthe ardor of his gratitude and the innocence of his heart, he almost\r\nresented his friend\xe2\x80\x99s question as a reproach which he had not deserved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I can ever forget,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, warmly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you swam\r\nashore with me and saved my life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey ventured a step nearer to the object that he had in view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne good turn deserves another,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold took his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d he eagerly rejoined--\xe2\x80\x9conly tell me\r\nwhat I can do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going to-day to see your new place, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you put off going till to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s any thing serious--of course I can!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey looked round at the entrance to the summer-house, to make sure\r\nthat they were alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know the governess here, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Silvester?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got into a little difficulty with Miss Silvester. And there\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t a living soul I can ask to help me but _you._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I will help you. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t so easy to say. Never mind--you\xe2\x80\x99re no saint either, are\r\nyou? You\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it a secret, of course? Look here! I\xe2\x80\x99ve acted like an\r\ninfernal fool. I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone and got the girl into a scrape--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold drew back, suddenly understanding him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens, Geoffrey! You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do! Wait a bit--that\xe2\x80\x99s not the worst of it. She has left the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeft the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeft, for good and all. She can\xe2\x80\x99t come back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she\xe2\x80\x99s written to her missus. Women (hang \xe2\x80\x98em!) never do these\r\nthings by halves. She\xe2\x80\x99s left a letter to say she\xe2\x80\x99s privately married,\r\nand gone off to her husband. Her husband is--Me. Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m married to\r\nher yet, you understand. I have only promised to marry her. She has gone\r\non first (on the sly) to a place four miles from this. And we settled I\r\nwas to follow, and marry her privately this afternoon. That\xe2\x80\x99s out of\r\nthe question now. While she\xe2\x80\x99s expecting me at the inn I shall be bowling\r\nalong to London. Somebody must tell her what has happened--or she\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nplay the devil, and the whole business will burst up. I can\xe2\x80\x99t trust any\r\nof the people here. I\xe2\x80\x99m done for, old chap, unless you help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold lifted his hands in dismay. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the most dreadful situation,\r\nGeoffrey, I ever heard of in my life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey thoroughly agreed with him. \xe2\x80\x9cEnough to knock a man over,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cisn\xe2\x80\x99t it? I\xe2\x80\x99d give something for a drink of beer.\xe2\x80\x9d He produced\r\nhis everlasting pipe, from sheer force of habit. \xe2\x80\x9cGot a match?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s mind was too preoccupied to notice the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m making light of your father\xe2\x80\x99s illness,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it seems to me--I must say it--it seems to me that\r\nthe poor girl has the first claim on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey looked at him in surly amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first claim on me? Do you think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to risk being cut out of\r\nmy father\xe2\x80\x99s will? Not for the best woman that ever put on a petticoat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s admiration of his friend was the solidly-founded admiration\r\nof many years; admiration for a man who could row, box, wrestle,\r\njump--above all, who could swim--as few other men could perform those\r\nexercises in contemporary England. But that answer shook his faith. Only\r\nfor the moment--unhappily for Arnold, only for the moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know best,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, a little coldly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey took his arm--roughly as he took every thing; but in a\r\ncompanionable and confidential way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, like a good fellow, and tell her what has happened. We\xe2\x80\x99ll start\r\nfrom here as if we were both going to the railway; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll drop you at\r\nthe foot-path, in the gig. You can get on to your own place afterward by\r\nthe evening train. It puts you to no inconvenience, and it\xe2\x80\x99s doing the\r\nkind thing by an old friend. There\xe2\x80\x99s no risk of being found out. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nto drive, remember! There\xe2\x80\x99s no servant with us, old boy, to notice, and\r\ntell tales.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven Arnold began to see dimly by this time that he was likely to pay\r\nhis debt of obligation with interest--as Sir Patrick had foretold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to say to her?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m bound to do all I can do to\r\nhelp you, and I will. But what am I to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a natural question to put. It was not an easy question to answer.\r\nWhat a man, under given muscular circumstances, could do, no person\r\nliving knew better than Geoffrey Delamayn. Of what a man, under given\r\nsocial circumstances, could say, no person living knew less.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here! say I\xe2\x80\x99m half distracted, and all that.\r\nAnd--wait a bit--tell her to stop where she is till I write to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold hesitated. Absolutely ignorant of that low and limited form of\r\nknowledge which is called \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d his inbred delicacy\r\nof mind revealed to him the serious difficulty of the position which his\r\nfriend was asking him to occupy as plainly as if he was looking at it\r\nthrough the warily-gathered experience of society of a man of twice his\r\nage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you write to her now, Geoffrey?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider for a minute, and you will see. You have trusted me with a\r\nvery awkward secret. I may be wrong--I never was mixed up in such a\r\nmatter before--but to present myself to this lady as your messenger\r\nseems exposing her to a dreadful humiliation. Am I to go and tell her\r\nto her face: \xe2\x80\x98I know what you are hiding from the knowledge of all the\r\nworld;\xe2\x80\x99 and is she to be expected to endure it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBosh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cThey can endure a deal more than you think.\r\nI wish you had heard how she bullied me, in this very place. My good\r\nfellow, you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand women. The grand secret, in dealing with a\r\nwoman, is to take her as you take a cat, by the scruff of the neck--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t face her--unless you will help me by breaking the thing to\r\nher first. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stick at no sacrifice to serve you; but--hang it!--make\r\nallowances, Geoffrey, for the difficulty you are putting me in. I am\r\nalmost a stranger; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how Miss Silvester may receive me,\r\nbefore I can open my lips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose last words touched the question on its practical side. The\r\nmatter-of-fact view of the difficulty was a view which Geoffrey\r\ninstantly recognized and understood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has the devil\xe2\x80\x99s own temper,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that.\r\nPerhaps I\xe2\x80\x99d better write. Have we time to go into the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. The house is full of people, and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t a minute to spare.\r\nWrite at once, and write here. I have got a pencil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I to write on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny thing--your brother\xe2\x80\x99s card.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey took the pencil which Arnold offered to him, and looked at the\r\ncard. The lines his brother had written covered it. There was no room\r\nleft. He felt in his pocket, and produced a letter--the letter which\r\nAnne had referred to at the interview between them--the letter which she\r\nhad written to insist on his attending the lawn-party at Windygates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis will do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s one of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s own letters to me. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom on the fourth page. If I write,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, turning suddenly on\r\nArnold, \xe2\x80\x9cyou promise to take it to her? Your hand on the bargain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe held out the hand which had saved Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s life in Lisbon Harbor, and\r\nreceived Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s promise, in remembrance of that time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, old fellow. I can tell you how to find the place as we go\r\nalong in the gig. By-the-by, there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that\xe2\x80\x99s rather important.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99d better mention it while I think of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t present yourself at the inn in your own name; and you\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t ask for her by _her_ name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho am I to ask for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a little awkward. She has gone there as a married woman, in case\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re particular about taking her in--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand. Go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she has planned to tell them (by way of making it all right and\r\nstraight for both of us, you know) that she expects her husband to join\r\nher. If I had been able to go I should have asked at the door for \xe2\x80\x98my\r\nwife.\xe2\x80\x99 You are going in my place--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I must ask at the door for \xe2\x80\x98my wife,\xe2\x80\x99 or I shall expose Miss\r\nSilvester to unpleasant consequences?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t object?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot I! I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what I say to the people of the inn. It\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nmeeting with Miss Silvester that I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll put that right for you--never fear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went at once to the table and rapidly scribbled a few lines--then\r\nstopped and considered. \xe2\x80\x9cWill that do?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked himself. \xe2\x80\x9cNo; I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nbetter say something spooney to quiet her.\xe2\x80\x9d He considered again, added a\r\nline, and brought his hand down on the table with a cheery smack.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do the business! Read it yourself, Arnold--it\xe2\x80\x99s not so badly\r\nwritten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold read the note without appearing to share his friend\xe2\x80\x99s favorable\r\nopinion of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is rather short,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I time to make it longer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not. But let Miss Silvester see for herself that you have no\r\ntime to make it longer. The train starts in less than half an hour. Put\r\nthe time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, all right! and the date too, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had just added the desired words and figures, and had given the\r\nrevised letter to Arnold, when Sir Patrick returned to announce that the\r\ngig was waiting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t a moment to lose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey started to his feet. Arnold hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must see Blanche!\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t leave Blanche without saying\r\ngood-by. Where is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick pointed to the steps, with a smile. Blanche had followed him\r\nfrom the house. Arnold ran out to her instantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, a little sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be back in two days,\xe2\x80\x9d Arnold whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right! Sir\r\nPatrick consents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held him fast by the arm. The hurried parting before other people\r\nseemed to be not a parting to Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s taste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will lose the train!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey seized Arnold by the arm which Blanche was holding, and\r\ntore him--literally tore him--away. The two were out of sight, in the\r\nshrubbery, before Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s indignation found words, and addressed\r\nitself to her uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is that brute going away with Mr. Brinkworth?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Delamayn is called to London by his father\xe2\x80\x99s illness,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sir\r\nPatrick. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t like him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick reflected a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is a young girl of eighteen,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am an\r\nold man of seventy. Curious, that we should agree about any thing. More\r\nthan curious that we should agree in disliking Mr. Delamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe roused himself, and looked again at Blanche. She was seated at the\r\ntable, with her head on her hand; absent, and out of spirits--thinking\r\nof Arnold, and set, with the future all smooth before them, not thinking\r\nhappily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Blanche! Blanche!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cone would think he had gone\r\nfor a voyage round the world. You silly child! he will be back again the\r\nday after to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t gone with that man!\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngot that man for a friend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! there! the man was rude enough I own. Never mind! he will leave\r\nthe man at the second station. Come back to the ball-room with me. Dance\r\nit off, my dear--dance it off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in no humor for dancing. I shall go up\r\nstairs, and talk about it to Anne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will do nothing of the sort!\xe2\x80\x9d said a third voice, suddenly joining\r\nin the conversation.\r\n\r\nBoth uncle and niece looked up, and found Lady Lundie at the top of the\r\nsummer-house steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forbid you to mention that woman\xe2\x80\x99s name again in my hearing,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued\r\nher ladyship. \xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick! I warned you (if you remember?) that the\r\nmatter of the governess was not a matter to be trifled with. My worst\r\nanticipations are realized. Miss Silvester has left the house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE EIGHTH.\r\n\r\nTHE SCANDAL.\r\n\r\nIT was still early in the afternoon when the guests at Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlawn-party began to compare notes together in corners, and to agree in\r\narriving at a general conviction that \xe2\x80\x9csome thing was wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche had mysteriously disappeared from her partners in the dance.\r\nLady Lundie had mysteriously abandoned her guests. Blanche had not\r\ncome back. Lady Lundie had returned with an artificial smile, and a\r\npreoccupied manner. She acknowledged that she was \xe2\x80\x9cnot very well.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nsame excuse had been given to account for Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s absence--and, again\r\n(some time previously), to explain Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal from the\r\ncroquet! A wit among the gentlemen declared it reminded him of declining\r\na verb. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not very well; thou art not very well; she is not very\r\nwell\xe2\x80\x9d--and so on. Sir Patrick too! Only think of the sociable Sir\r\nPatrick being in a state of seclusion--pacing up and down by himself in\r\nthe loneliest part of the garden. And the servants again! it had even\r\nspread to the servants! _They_ were presuming to whisper in corners,\r\nlike their betters. The house-maids appeared, spasmodically, where house\r\nmaids had no business to be. Doors banged and petticoats whisked in the\r\nupper regions. Something wrong--depend upon it, something wrong! \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nhad much better go away. My dear, order the carriage\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cLouisa, love,\r\nno more dancing; your papa is going.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9c_Good_-afternoon, Lady\r\nLundie!\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cHaw! thanks very much!\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9c_So_ sorry for dear Blanche!\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s been _too_ charming!\xe2\x80\x9d So Society jabbered its poor, nonsensical\r\nlittle jargon, and got itself politely out of the way before the storm\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nThis was exactly the consummation of events for which Sir Patrick had\r\nbeen waiting in the seclusion of the garden.\r\n\r\nThere was no evading the responsibility which was now thrust upon him.\r\nLady Lundie had announced it as a settled resolution, on her part, to\r\ntrace Anne to the place in which she had taken refuge, and discover\r\n(purely in the interests of virtue) whether she actually was married\r\nor not. Blanche (already overwrought by the excitement of the day) had\r\nbroken into an hysterical passion of tears on hearing the news, and had\r\nthen, on recovering, taken a view of her own of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s flight from the\r\nhouse. Anne would never have kept her marriage a secret from Blanche;\r\nAnne would never have written such a formal farewell letter as she had\r\nwritten to Blanche--if things were going as smoothly with her as she\r\nwas trying to make them believe at Windygates. Some dreadful trouble\r\nhad fallen on Anne and Blanche was determined (as Lady Lundie was\r\ndetermined) to find out where she had gone, and to follow, and help her.\r\n\r\nIt was plain to Sir Patrick (to whom both ladies had opened their\r\nhearts, at separate interviews) that his sister-in-law, in one way, and\r\nhis niece in another, were equally likely--if not duly restrained--to\r\nplunge headlong into acts of indiscretion which might lead to very\r\nundesirable results. A man in authority was sorely needed at Windygates\r\nthat afternoon--and Sir Patrick was fain to acknowledge that he was the\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch is to be said for, and much is to be said against a single\r\nlife,\xe2\x80\x9d thought the old gentleman, walking up and down the sequestered\r\ngarden-path to which he had retired, and applying himself at shorter\r\nintervals than usual to the knob of his ivory cane. \xe2\x80\x9cThis, however,\r\nis, I take it, certain. A man\xe2\x80\x99s married friends can\xe2\x80\x99t prevent him from\r\nleading the life of a bachelor, if he pleases. But they can, and do,\r\ntake devilish good care that he sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s meditations were interrupted by the appearance of a\r\nservant, previously instructed to keep him informed of the progress of\r\nevents at the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re all gone, Sir Patrick,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a comfort, Simpson. We have no visitors to deal with now, except\r\nthe visitors who are staying in the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone, Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re all gentlemen, are they not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s another comfort, Simpson. Very good. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see Lady Lundie\r\nfirst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDoes any other form of human resolution approach the firmness of a\r\nwoman who is bent on discovering the frailties of another woman whom she\r\nhates? You may move rocks, under a given set of circumstances. But here\r\nis a delicate being in petticoats, who shrieks if a spider drops on her\r\nneck, and shudders if you approach her after having eaten an onion. Can\r\nyou move _her,_ under a given set of circumstances, as set forth above?\r\nNot you!\r\n\r\nSir Patrick found her ladyship instituting her inquiries on the same\r\nadmirably exhaustive system which is pursued, in cases of disappearance,\r\nby the police. Who was the last witness who had seen the missing person?\r\nWho was the last servant who had seen Anne Silvester? Begin with the\r\nmen-servants, from the butler at the top to the stable boy at the\r\nbottom. Go on with the women-servants, from the cook in all her glory\r\nto the small female child who weeds the garden. Lady Lundie had\r\ncross-examined her way downward as far as the page, when Sir Patrick\r\njoined her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear lady! pardon me for reminding you again, that this is a\r\nfree country, and that you have no claim whatever to investigate Miss\r\nSilvester\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings after she has left your house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie raised her eyes, devotionally, to the ceiling. She looked\r\nlike a martyr to duty. If you had seen her ladyship at that moment, you\r\nwould have said yourself, \xe2\x80\x9cA martyr to duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir Patrick! As a Christian woman, that is not _my_ way of looking\r\nat it. This unhappy person has lived under my roof. This unhappy person\r\nhas been the companion of Blanche. I am responsible--I am, in a manner,\r\nmorally responsible. I would give the world to be able to dismiss it\r\nas you do. But no! I must be satisfied that she _is_ married. In the\r\ninterests of propriety. For the quieting of my own conscience. Before I\r\nlay my head on my pillow to-night, Sir Patrick--before I lay my head on\r\nmy pillow to-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word, Lady Lundie--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated her ladyship, with the most pathetic gentleness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nare right, I dare say, from the worldly point of view. I can\xe2\x80\x99t take the\r\nworldly point of view. The worldly point of view hurts me.\xe2\x80\x9d She turned,\r\nwith impressive gravity, to the page. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know where you will go,\r\nJonathan, if you tell lies!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJonathan was lazy, Jonathan was pimply, Jonathan was fat--_but_ Jonathan\r\nwas orthodox. He answered that he did know; and, what is more, he\r\nmentioned the place.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick saw that further opposition on his part, at that moment,\r\nwould be worse than useless. He wisely determined to wait, before he\r\ninterfered again, until Lady Lundie had thoroughly exhausted herself and\r\nher inquiries. At the same time--as it was impossible, in the present\r\nstate of her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s temper, to provide against what might happen\r\nif the inquiries after Anne unluckily proved successful--he decided on\r\ntaking measures to clear the house of the guests (in the interests of\r\nall parties) for the next four-and-twenty hours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only want to ask you a question, Lady Lundie,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nposition of the gentlemen who are staying here is not a very pleasant\r\none while all this is going on. If you had been content to let the\r\nmatter pass without notice, we should have done very well. As things\r\nare, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it will be more convenient to every body if I\r\nrelieve you of the responsibility of entertaining your guests?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs head of the family?\xe2\x80\x9d stipulated Lady Lundie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs head of the family!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gratefully accept the proposal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Lundie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg you won\xe2\x80\x99t mention it,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\nHe quitted the room, leaving Jonathan under examination. He and his\r\nbrother (the late Sir Thomas) had chosen widely different paths in life,\r\nand had seen but little of each other since the time when they had been\r\nboys. Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s recollections (on leaving Lady Lundie) appeared\r\nto have taken him back to that time, and to have inspired him with a\r\ncertain tenderness for his brother\xe2\x80\x99s memory. He shook his head, and\r\nsighed a sad little sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, softly, after\r\nhe had shut the door on his brother\xe2\x80\x99s widow. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn crossing the hall, he stopped the first servant he met, to inquire\r\nafter Blanche. Miss Blanche was quiet, up stairs, closeted with her maid\r\nin her own room. \xe2\x80\x9cQuiet?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a bad sign. I\r\nshall hear more of my niece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPending that event, the next thing to do was to find the guests.\r\nUnerring instinct led Sir Patrick to the billiard-room. There he found\r\nthem, in solemn conclave assembled, wondering what they had better do.\r\nSir Patrick put them all at their ease in two minutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say to a day\xe2\x80\x99s shooting to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nEvery man present--sportsman or not--said yes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can start from this house,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Sir Patrick; \xe2\x80\x9cor you can start\r\nfrom a shooting-cottage which is on the Windygates property--among the\r\nwoods, on the other side of the moor. The weather looks pretty well\r\nsettled (for Scotland), and there are plenty of horses in the stables.\r\nIt is useless to conceal from you, gentlemen, that events have taken a\r\ncertain unexpected turn in my sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s family circle. You will\r\nbe equally Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s guests, whether you choose the cottage or the\r\nhouse. For the next twenty-four hours (let us say)--which shall it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery body--with or without rheumatism--answered \xe2\x80\x9cthe cottage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is arranged to ride over to the\r\nshooting-cottage this evening, and to try the moor, on that side, the\r\nfirst thing in the morning. If events here will allow me, I shall be\r\ndelighted to accompany you, and do the honors as well as I can. If not,\r\nI am sure you will accept my apologies for to-night, and permit Lady\r\nLundie\xe2\x80\x99s steward to see to your comfort in my place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAdopted unanimously. Sir Patrick left the guests to their billiards, and\r\nwent out to give the necessary orders at the stables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Blanche remained portentously quiet in the upper\r\nregions of the house; while Lady Lundie steadily pursued her inquiries\r\ndown stairs. She got on from Jonathan (last of the males, indoors) to\r\nthe coachman (first of the males, out-of-doors), and dug down, man by\r\nman, through that new stratum, until she struck the stable-boy at the\r\nbottom. Not an atom of information having been extracted in the house\r\nor out of the house, from man or boy, her ladyship fell back on\r\nthe women next. She pulled the bell, and summoned the cook--Hester\r\nDethridge.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable-looking person entered the room.\r\n\r\nElderly and quiet; scrupulously clean; eminently respectable; her gray\r\nhair neat and smooth under her modest white cap; her eyes, set deep in\r\ntheir orbits, looking straight at any person who spoke to her--here,\r\nat a first view, was a steady, trust-worthy woman. Here also on closer\r\ninspection, was a woman with the seal of some terrible past suffering\r\nset on her for the rest of her life. You felt it, rather than saw it, in\r\nthe look of immovable endurance which underlain her expression--in the\r\ndeathlike tranquillity which never disappeared from her manner. Her\r\nstory was a sad one--so far as it was known. She had entered Lady\r\nLundie\xe2\x80\x99s service at the period of Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s marriage to Sir Thomas.\r\nHer character (given by the clergyman of her parish) described her as\r\nhaving been married to an inveterate drunkard, and as having suffered\r\nunutterably during her husband\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime. There were drawbacks to\r\nengaging her, now that she was a widow. On one of the many occasions on\r\nwhich her husband had personally ill-treated her, he had struck her a\r\nblow which had produced very remarkable nervous results. She had lain\r\ninsensible many days together, and had recovered with the total loss of\r\nher speech. In addition to this objection, she was odd, at times, in her\r\nmanner; and she made it a condition of accepting any situation, that she\r\nshould be privileged to sleep in a room by herself As a set-off against\r\nall this, it was to be said, on the other side of the question, that she\r\nwas sober; rigidly honest in all her dealings; and one of the best cooks\r\nin England. In consideration of this last merit, the late Sir Thomas\r\nhad decided on giving her a trial, and had discovered that he had never\r\ndined in his life as he dined when Hester Dethridge was at the head of\r\nhis kitchen. She remained after his death in his widow\xe2\x80\x99s service. Lady\r\nLundie was far from liking her. An unpleasant suspicion attached to the\r\ncook, which Sir Thomas had over-looked, but which persons less sensible\r\nof the immense importance of dining well could not fail to regard as\r\na serious objection to her. Medical men, consulted about her case\r\ndiscovered certain physiological anomalies in it which led them to\r\nsuspect the woman of feigning dumbness, for some reason best known\r\nto herself. She obstinately declined to learn the deaf and dumb\r\nalphabet--on the ground that dumbness was not associated with deafness\r\nin her case. Stratagems were invented (seeing that she really did\r\npossess the use of her ears) to entrap her into also using her speech,\r\nand failed. Efforts were made to induce her to answer questions relating\r\nto her past life in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s time. She flatly declined to reply\r\nto them, one and all. At certain intervals, strange impulses to get a\r\nholiday away from the house appeared to seize her. If she was resisted,\r\nshe passively declined to do her work. If she was threatened with\r\ndismissal, she impenetrably bowed her head, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cGive\r\nme the word, and I go.\xe2\x80\x9d Over and over again, Lady Lundie had decided,\r\nnaturally enough, on no longer keeping such a servant as this; but she\r\nhad never yet carried the decision to execution. A cook who is a perfect\r\nmistress of her art, who asks for no perquisites, who allows no waste,\r\nwho never quarrels with the other servants, who drinks nothing stronger\r\nthan tea, who is to be trusted with untold gold--is not a cook easily\r\nreplaced. In this mortal life we put up with many persons and things,\r\nas Lady Lundie put up with her cook. The woman lived, as it were, on the\r\nbrink of dismissal--but thus far the woman kept her place--getting her\r\nholidays when she asked for them (which, to do her justice, was not\r\noften) and sleeping always (go where she might with the family) with a\r\nlocked door, in a room by herself.\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge advanced slowly to the table at which Lady Lundie was\r\nsitting. A slate and pencil hung at her side, which she used for making\r\nsuch replies as were not to be expressed by a gesture or by a motion\r\nof the head. She took up the slate and pencil, and waited with stony\r\nsubmission for her mistress to begin.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie opened the proceedings with the regular formula of inquiry\r\nwhich she had used with all the other servants,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know that Miss Silvester has left the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cook nodded her head affirmatively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know at what time she left it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother affirmative reply. The first which Lady Lundie had received to\r\nthat question yet. She eagerly went on to the next inquiry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen her since she left the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA third affirmative reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge wrote slowly on the slate, in singularly firm upright\r\ncharacters for a woman in her position of life, these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the road that leads to the railway. Nigh to Mistress Chew\xe2\x80\x99s Farm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you want at Chew\xe2\x80\x99s Farm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted eggs for the kitchen, and a breath of\r\nfresh air for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Miss Silvester see you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA negative shake of the head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she take the turning that leads to the railway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother negative shake of the head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe went on, toward the moor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn affirmative reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did she do when she got to the moor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cShe took the footpath which leads to Craig\r\nFernie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie rose excitedly to her feet. There was but one place that a\r\nstranger could go to at Craig Fernie. \xe2\x80\x9cThe inn!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed her ladyship.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has gone to the inn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge waited immovably. Lady Lundie put a last precautionary\r\nquestion, in these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you reported what you have seen to any body else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn affirmative reply. Lady Lundie had not bargained for that. Hester\r\nDethridge (she thought) must surely have misunderstood her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that you have told somebody else what you have just told\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother affirmative reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA person who questioned you, as I have done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA third affirmative reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge wrote on her slate: \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Blanche.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie stepped back, staggered by the discovery that Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresolution to trace Anne Silvester was, to all appearance, as firmly\r\nsettled as her own. Her step-daughter was keeping her own counsel, and\r\nacting on her own responsibility--her step-daughter might be an awkward\r\nobstacle in the way. The manner in which Anne had left the house had\r\nmortally offended Lady Lundie. An inveterately vindictive woman, she had\r\nresolved to discover whatever compromising elements might exist in the\r\ngoverness\xe2\x80\x99s secret, and to make them public property (from a paramount\r\nsense of duty, of course) among her own circle of friends. But to do\r\nthis--with Blanche acting (as might certainly be anticipated) in direct\r\nopposition to her, and openly espousing Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s interests--was\r\nmanifestly impossible.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done--and that instantly--was to inform Blanche\r\nthat she was discovered, and to forbid her to stir in the matter.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie rang the bell twice--thus intimating, according to the laws\r\nof the household, that she required the attendance of her own maid.\r\nShe then turned to the cook--still waiting her pleasure, with stony\r\ncomposure, slate in hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have done wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said her ladyship, severely. \xe2\x80\x9cI am your mistress.\r\nYou are bound to answer your mistress--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge bowed her head, in icy acknowledgment of the principle\r\nlaid down--so far.\r\n\r\nThe bow was an interruption. Lady Lundie resented it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Miss Blanche is _not_ your mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nare very much to blame for answering Miss Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries about Miss\r\nSilvester.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge, perfectly unmoved, wrote her justification on her\r\nslate, in two stiff sentences: \xe2\x80\x9cI had no orders _not_ to answer. I keep\r\nnobody\xe2\x80\x99s secrets but my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat reply settled the question of the cook\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal--the question\r\nwhich had been pending for months past.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are an insolent woman! I have borne with you long enough--I will\r\nbear with you no longer. When your month is up, you go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn those words Lady Lundie dismissed Hester Dethridge from her service.\r\n\r\nNot the slightest change passed over the sinister tranquillity of\r\nthe cook. She bowed her head again, in acknowledgment of the sentence\r\npronounced on her--dropped her slate at her side--turned about--and left\r\nthe room. The woman was alive in the world, and working in the world;\r\nand yet (so far as all human interests were concerned) she was as\r\ncompletely out of the world as if she had been screwed down in her\r\ncoffin, and laid in her grave.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s maid came into the room as Hester left it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo up stairs to Miss Blanche,\xe2\x80\x9d said her mistress, \xe2\x80\x9cand say I want her\r\nhere. Wait a minute!\xe2\x80\x9d She paused, and considered. Blanche might decline\r\nto submit to her step-mother\xe2\x80\x99s interference with her. It might be\r\nnecessary to appeal to the higher authority of her guardian. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nknow where Sir Patrick is?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lady Lundie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard Simpson say, my lady, that Sir Patrick was at the stables.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend Simpson with a message. My compliments to Sir Patrick--and I wish\r\nto see him immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the departure to the shooting-cottage were just\r\ncompleted; and the one question that remained to be settled was, whether\r\nSir Patrick could accompany the party--when the man-servant appeared\r\nwith the message from his mistress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you give me a quarter of an hour, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sir Patrick.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that time I shall know for certain whether I can go with you or\r\nnot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, the guests decided to wait. The younger men\r\namong them (being Englishmen) naturally occupied their leisure time in\r\nbetting. Would Sir Patrick get the better of the domestic crisis? or\r\nwould the domestic crisis get the better of Sir Patrick? The domestic\r\ncrisis was backed, at two to one, to win.\r\n\r\nPunctually at the expiration of the quarter of an hour, Sir Patrick\r\nreappeared. The domestic crisis had betrayed the blind confidence which\r\nyouth and inexperience had placed in it. Sir Patrick had won the day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThings are settled and quiet, gentlemen; and I am able to accompany\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are two ways to the shooting-cottage. One--the\r\nlongest--passes by the inn at Craig Fernie. I am compelled to ask you\r\nto go with me by that way. While you push on to the cottage, I must drop\r\nbehind, and say a word to a person who is staying at the inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had quieted Lady Lundie--he had even quieted Blanche. But it was\r\nevidently on the condition that he was to go to Craig Fernie in their\r\nplaces, and to see Anne Silvester himself. Without a word more\r\nof explanation he mounted his horse, and led the way out. The\r\nshooting-party left Windygates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND SCENE.--THE INN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE NINTH.\r\n\r\nANNE.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYE\xe2\x80\x99LL just permit me to remind ye again, young leddy, that the hottle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfull--exceptin\xe2\x80\x99 only this settin\xe2\x80\x99-room, and the bedchamber yonder\r\nbelonging to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo spoke \xe2\x80\x9cMistress Inchbare,\xe2\x80\x9d landlady of the Craig Fernie Inn, to Anne\r\nSilvester, standing in the parlor, purse in hand, and offering the price\r\nof the two rooms before she claimed permission to occupy them.\r\n\r\nThe time of the afternoon was about the time when Geoffrey Delamayn had\r\nstarted in the train, on his journey to London. About the time also,\r\nwhen Arnold Brinkworth had crossed the moor, and was mounting the first\r\nrising ground which led to the inn.\r\n\r\nMistress Inchbare was tall and thin, and decent and dry. Mistress\r\nInchbare\xe2\x80\x99s unlovable hair clung fast round her head in wiry little\r\nyellow curls. Mistress Inchbare\xe2\x80\x99s hard bones showed themselves, like\r\nMistress Inchbare\xe2\x80\x99s hard Presbyterianism, without any concealment or\r\ncompromise. In short, a savagely-respectable woman who plumed herself on\r\npresiding over a savagely-respectable inn.\r\n\r\nThere was no competition to interfere with Mistress Inchbare. She\r\nregulated her own prices, and made her own rules. If you objected to\r\nher prices, and revolted from her rules, you were free to go. In other\r\nwords, you were free to cast yourself, in the capacity of houseless\r\nwanderer, on the scanty mercy of a Scotch wilderness. The village of\r\nCraig Fernie was a collection of hovels. The country about Craig Fernie,\r\nmountain on one side and moor on the other, held no second house of\r\npublic entertainment, for miles and miles round, at any point of the\r\ncompass. No rambling individual but the helpless British Tourist wanted\r\nfood and shelter from strangers in that part of Scotland; and nobody\r\nbut Mistress Inchbare had food and shelter to sell. A more thoroughly\r\nindependent person than this was not to be found on the face of the\r\nhotel-keeping earth. The most universal of all civilized terrors--the\r\nterror of appearing unfavorably in the newspapers--was a sensation\r\nabsolutely unknown to the Empress of the Inn. You lost your temper,\r\nand threatened to send her bill for exhibition in the public journals.\r\nMistress Inchbare raised no objection to your taking any course you\r\npleased with it. \xe2\x80\x9cEh, man! send the bill whar\xe2\x80\x99 ye like, as long as ye\r\npay it first. There\xe2\x80\x99s nae such thing as a newspaper ever darkens my\r\ndoors. Ye\xe2\x80\x99ve got the Auld and New Testaments in your bedchambers, and\r\nthe natural history o\xe2\x80\x99 Pairthshire on the coffee-room table--and if\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s no\xe2\x80\x99 reading eneugh for ye, ye may een gae back South again, and\r\nget the rest of it there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the inn at which Anne Silvester had appeared alone, with\r\nnothing but a little bag in her hand. This was the woman whose\r\nreluctance to receive her she innocently expected to overcome by showing\r\nher purse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMention your charge for the rooms,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am willing to pay for\r\nthem beforehand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer majesty, Mrs. Inchbare, never even looked at her subject\xe2\x80\x99s poor\r\nlittle purse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt just comes to this, mistress,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no\xe2\x80\x99 free to tak\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyour money, if I\xe2\x80\x99m no\xe2\x80\x99 free to let ye the last rooms left in the hoose.\r\nThe Craig Fernie hottle is a faimily hottle--and has its ain gude name\r\nto keep up. Ye\xe2\x80\x99re ower-well-looking, my young leddy, to be traveling\r\nalone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe time had been when Anne would have answered sharply enough. The hard\r\nnecessities of her position made her patient now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already told you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cmy husband is coming here to\r\njoin me.\xe2\x80\x9d She sighed wearily as she repeated her ready-made story--and\r\ndropped into the nearest chair, from sheer inability to stand any\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nMistress Inchbare looked at her, with the exact measure of compassionate\r\ninterest which she might have shown if she had been looking at a stray\r\ndog who had fallen footsore at the door of the inn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeel! weel! sae let it be. Bide awhile, and rest ye. We\xe2\x80\x99ll no\xe2\x80\x99 chairge\r\nye for that--and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if your husband comes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just let the\r\nrooms, mistress, to _him,_, instead o\xe2\x80\x99 lettin\xe2\x80\x99 them to _you._ And, sae,\r\ngood-morrow t\xe2\x80\x99 ye.\xe2\x80\x9d With that final announcement of her royal will and\r\npleasure, the Empress of the Inn withdrew.\r\n\r\nAnne made no reply. She watched the landlady out of the room--and then\r\nstruggled to control herself no longer. In her position, suspicion was\r\ndoubly insult. The hot tears of shame gathered in her eyes; and the\r\nheart-ache wrung her, poor soul--wrung her without mercy.\r\n\r\nA trifling noise in the room startled her. She looked up, and detected\r\na man in a corner, dusting the furniture, and apparently acting in the\r\ncapacity of attendant at the inn. He had shown her into the parlor on\r\nher arrival; but he had remained so quietly in the room that she had\r\nnever noticed him since, until that moment.\r\n\r\nHe was an ancient man--with one eye filmy and blind, and one eye moist\r\nand merry. His head was bald; his feet were gouty; his nose was justly\r\ncelebrated as the largest nose and the reddest nose in that part of\r\nScotland. The mild wisdom of years was expressed mysteriously in his\r\nmellow smile. In contact with this wicked world, his manner revealed\r\nthat happy mixture of two extremes--the servility which just\r\ntouches independence, and the independence which just touches\r\nservility--attained by no men in existence but Scotchmen. Enormous\r\nnative impudence, which amused but never offended; immeasurable cunning,\r\nmasquerading habitually under the double disguise of quaint prejudice\r\nand dry humor, were the solid moral foundations on which the character\r\nof this elderly person was built. No amount of whisky ever made him\r\ndrunk; and no violence of bell-ringing ever hurried his movements. Such\r\nwas the headwaiter at the Craig Fernie Inn; known, far and wide, to\r\nlocal fame, as \xe2\x80\x9cMaister Bishopriggs, Mistress Inchbare\xe2\x80\x99s right-hand\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing there?\xe2\x80\x9d Anne asked, sharply.\r\n\r\nMr. Bishopriggs turned himself about on his gouty feet; waved his duster\r\ngently in the air; and looked at Anne, with a mild, paternal smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! Am just doostin\xe2\x80\x99 the things; and setin\xe2\x80\x99 the room in decent order\r\nfor ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor _me?_ Did you hear what the landlady said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bishopriggs advanced confidentially, and pointed with a very\r\nunsteady forefinger to the purse which Anne still held in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever fash yoursel\xe2\x80\x99 aboot the landleddy!\xe2\x80\x9d said the sage chief of the\r\nCraig Fernie waiters. \xe2\x80\x9cYour purse speaks for you, my lassie. Pet it up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n cried Mr. Bishopriggs, waving temptation away from him with the duster.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn wi\xe2\x80\x99 it into yer pocket! Sae long as the warld\xe2\x80\x99s the warld, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nuphaud it any where--while there\xe2\x80\x99s siller in the purse, there\xe2\x80\x99s gude in\r\nthe woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s patience, which had resisted harder trials, gave way at this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by speaking to me in that familiar manner?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked,\r\nrising angrily to her feet again.\r\n\r\nMr. Bishopriggs tucked his duster under his arm, and proceeded to\r\nsatisfy Anne that he shared the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s view of her position, without\r\nsharing the severity of the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s principles. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nae man\r\nlivin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bishopriggs, \xe2\x80\x9clooks with mair indulgence at human\r\nfrailty than my ain sel\xe2\x80\x99. Am I no\xe2\x80\x99 to be familiar wi\xe2\x80\x99 ye--when I\xe2\x80\x99m auld\r\neneugh to be a fether to ye, and ready to be a fether to ye till further\r\nnotice? Hech! hech! Order your bit dinner lassie. Husband or no husband,\r\nye\xe2\x80\x99ve got a stomach, and ye must een eat. There\xe2\x80\x99s fesh and there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfowl--or, maybe, ye\xe2\x80\x99ll be for the sheep\xe2\x80\x99s head singit, when they\xe2\x80\x99ve done\r\nwith it at the tabble dot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was but one way of getting rid of him: \xe2\x80\x9cOrder what you like,\xe2\x80\x9d Anne\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cand leave the room.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bishopriggs highly approved of the first\r\nhalf of the sentence, and totally overlooked the second.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay--just pet a\xe2\x80\x99 yer little interests in my hands; it\xe2\x80\x99s the wisest\r\nthing ye can do. Ask for Maister Bishopriggs (that\xe2\x80\x99s me) when ye want a\r\ndecent \xe2\x80\x98sponsible man to gi\xe2\x80\x99 ye a word of advice. Set ye doon again--set\r\nye doon. And don\xe2\x80\x99t tak\xe2\x80\x99 the arm-chair. Hech! hech! yer husband will\r\nbe coming, ye know, and he\xe2\x80\x99s sure to want it!\xe2\x80\x9d With that seasonable\r\npleasantry the venerable Bishopriggs winked, and went out.\r\n\r\nAnne looked at her watch. By her calculation it was not far from the\r\nhour when Geoffrey might be expected to arrive at the inn, assuming\r\nGeoffrey to have left Windygates at the time agreed on. A little more\r\npatience, and the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s scruples would be satisfied, and the ordeal\r\nwould be at an end.\r\n\r\nCould she have met him nowhere else than at this barbarous house, and\r\namong these barbarous people?\r\n\r\nNo. Outside the doors of Windygates she had not a friend to help her in\r\nall Scotland. There was no place at her disposal but the inn; and she\r\nhad only to be thankful that it occupied a sequestered situation, and\r\nwas not likely to be visited by any of Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s friends. Whatever\r\nthe risk might be, the end in view justified her in confronting it. Her\r\nwhole future depended on Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s making an honest woman of her. Not\r\nher future with _him_--that way there was no hope; that way her life was\r\nwasted. Her future with Blanche--she looked forward to nothing now but\r\nher future with Blanche.\r\n\r\nHer spirits sank lower and lower. The tears rose again. It would only\r\nirritate him if he came and found her crying. She tried to divert her\r\nmind by looking about the room.\r\n\r\nThere was very little to see. Except that it was solidly built of good\r\nsound stone, the Craig Fernie hotel differed in no other important\r\nrespect from the average of second-rate English inns. There was the\r\nusual slippery black sofa--constructed to let you slide when you wanted\r\nto rest. There was the usual highly-varnished arm-chair, expressly\r\nmanufactured to test the endurance of the human spine. There was the\r\nusual paper on the walls, of the pattern designed to make your eyes ache\r\nand your head giddy. There were the usual engravings, which humanity\r\nnever tires of contemplating. The Royal Portrait, in the first place of\r\nhonor. The next greatest of all human beings--the Duke of Wellington--in\r\nthe second place of honor. The third greatest of all human beings--the\r\nlocal member of parliament--in the third place of honor; and a hunting\r\nscene, in the dark. A door opposite the door of admission from the\r\npassage opened into the bedroom; and a window at the side looked out on\r\nthe open space in front of the hotel, and commanded a view of the vast\r\nexpanse of the Craig Fernie moor, stretching away below the rising\r\nground on which the house was built.\r\n\r\nAnne turned in despair from the view in the room to the view from the\r\nwindow. Within the last half hour it had changed for the worse. The\r\nclouds had gathered; the sun was hidden; the light on the landscape was\r\ngray and dull. Anne turned from the window, as she had turned from the\r\nroom. She was just making the hopeless attempt to rest her weary limbs\r\non the sofa, when the sound of voices and footsteps in the passage\r\ncaught her ear.\r\n\r\nWas Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s voice among them? No.\r\n\r\nWere the strangers coming in?\r\n\r\nThe landlady had declined to let her have the rooms: it was quite\r\npossible that the strangers might be coming to look at them. There was\r\nno knowing who they might be. In the impulse of the moment she flew to\r\nthe bedchamber and locked herself in.\r\n\r\nThe door from the passage opened, and Arnold Brinkworth--shown in by Mr.\r\nBishopriggs--entered the sitting-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody here!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Arnold, looking round. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bishopriggs pointed to the bedroom door. \xe2\x80\x9cEh! yer good leddy\xe2\x80\x99s joost\r\nin the bedchamber, nae doot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold started. He had felt no difficulty (when he and Geoffrey had\r\ndiscussed the question at Windygates) about presenting himself at\r\nthe inn in the assumed character of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s husband. But the result of\r\nputting the deception in practice was, to say the least of it, a little\r\nembarrassing at first. Here was the waiter describing Miss Silvester\r\nas his \xe2\x80\x9cgood lady;\xe2\x80\x9d and leaving it (most naturally and properly) to the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgood lady\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d husband to knock at her bedroom door, and tell her that he\r\nwas there. In despair of knowing what else to do at the moment, Arnold\r\nasked for the landlady, whom he had not seen on arriving at the inn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe landleddy\xe2\x80\x99s just tottin\xe2\x80\x99 up the ledgers o\xe2\x80\x99 the hottle in her ain\r\nroom,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Bishopriggs. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll be here anon--the wearyful\r\nwoman!--speerin\xe2\x80\x99 who ye are and what ye are, and takin\xe2\x80\x99 a\xe2\x80\x99 the business\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 the hoose on her ain pair o\xe2\x80\x99 shouthers.\xe2\x80\x9d He dropped the subject of\r\nthe landlady, and put in a plea for himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI ha\xe2\x80\x99 lookit after a\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nleddy\xe2\x80\x99s little comforts, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cTrust in me! trust in me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s attention was absorbed in the very serious difficulty of\r\nannouncing his arrival to Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cHow am I to get her out?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to\r\nhimself, with a look of perplexity directed at the bedroom door.\r\n\r\nHe had spoken loud enough for the waiter to hear him. Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s look of\r\nperplexity was instantly reflected on the face of Mr. Bishopriggs.\r\nThe head-waiter at Craig Fernie possessed an immense experience of the\r\nmanners and customs of newly-married people on their honeymoon trip.\r\nHe had been a second father (with excellent pecuniary results) to\r\ninnumerable brides and bridegrooms. He knew young married couples in\r\nall their varieties:--The couples who try to behave as if they had been\r\nmarried for many years; the couples who attempt no concealment, and\r\ntake advice from competent authorities about them. The couples who are\r\nbashfully talkative before third persons; the couples who are bashfully\r\nsilent under similar circumstances. The couples who don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nto do, the couples who wish it was over; the couples who must never\r\nbe intruded upon without careful preliminary knocking at the door; the\r\ncouples who _can_ eat and drink in the intervals of \xe2\x80\x9cbliss,\xe2\x80\x9d and the\r\nother couples who _can\xe2\x80\x99t._ But the bridegroom who stood helpless on\r\none side of the door, and the bride who remained locked in on the other,\r\nwere new varieties of the nuptial species, even in the vast experience\r\nof Mr. Bishopriggs himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoo are ye to get her oot?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show ye hoo!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nadvanced as rapidly as his gouty feet would let him, and knocked at\r\nthe bedroom door. \xe2\x80\x9cEh, my leddy! here he is in flesh and bluid.\r\nMercy preserve us! do ye lock the door of the nuptial chamber in your\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s face?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that unanswerable appeal the lock was heard turning in the door. Mr.\r\nBishopriggs winked at Arnold with his one available eye, and laid his\r\nforefinger knowingly along his enormous nose. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m away before she\r\nfalls into your arms! Rely on it I\xe2\x80\x99ll no come in again without knocking\r\nfirst!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe left Arnold alone in the room. The bedroom door opened slowly by a\r\nfew inches at a time. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s voice was just audible speaking cautiously\r\nbehind it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that you, Geoffrey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s heart began to beat fast, in anticipation of the disclosure\r\nwhich was now close at hand. He knew neither what to say or do--he\r\nremained silent.\r\n\r\nAnne repeated the question in louder tones:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was the certain prospect of alarming her, if some reply was not\r\ngiven. There was no help for it. Come what come might, Arnold answered,\r\nin a whisper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door was flung wide open. Anne Silvester appeared on the threshold,\r\nconfronting him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Brinkworth!!!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, standing petrified with astonishment.\r\n\r\nFor a moment more neither of them spoke. Anne advanced one step into\r\nthe sitting-room, and put the next inevitable question, with an\r\ninstantaneous change from surprise to suspicion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s letter represented the only possible excuse for Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nappearance in that place, and at that time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have got a letter for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said--and offered it to her.\r\n\r\nShe was instantly on her guard. They were little better than strangers\r\nto each other, as Arnold had said. A sickening presentiment of some\r\ntreachery on Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s part struck cold to her heart. She refused to\r\ntake the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect no letter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWho told you I was here?\xe2\x80\x9d She put\r\nthe question, not only with a tone of suspicion, but with a look of\r\ncontempt. The look was not an easy one for a man to bear. It required\r\na momentary exertion of self-control on Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s part, before he could\r\ntrust himself to answer with due consideration for her. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there a\r\nwatch set on my actions?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, with rising anger. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd are _you_\r\nthe spy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t known me very long, Miss Silvester,\xe2\x80\x9d Arnold answered,\r\nquietly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you ought to know me better than to say that. I am the\r\nbearer of a letter from Geoffrey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was an the point of following his example, and of speaking of\r\nGeoffrey by his Christian name, on her side. But she checked herself,\r\nbefore the word had passed her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean Mr. Delamayn?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat occasion have _I_ for a letter from Mr. Delamayn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was determined to acknowledge nothing--she kept him obstinately at\r\narm\xe2\x80\x99s-length. Arnold did, as a matter of instinct, what a man of larger\r\nexperience would have done, as a matter of calculation--he closed with\r\nher boldly, then and there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Silvester! it\xe2\x80\x99s no use beating about the bush. If you won\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\nthe letter, you force me to speak out. I am here on a very unpleasant\r\nerrand. I begin to wish, from the bottom of my heart, I had never\r\nundertaken it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA quick spasm of pain passed across her face. She was beginning, dimly\r\nbeginning, to understand him. He hesitated. His generous nature shrank\r\nfrom hurting her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with an effort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry not to be angry with me, Miss Silvester. Geoffrey and I are old\r\nfriends. Geoffrey knows he can trust me--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust you?\xe2\x80\x9d she interposed. \xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold waited. She went on, speaking to herself, not to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was in the other room I asked if Geoffrey was there. And this\r\nman answered for him.\xe2\x80\x9d She sprang forward with a cry of horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he told you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, read his letter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe violently pushed back the hand with which Arnold once more offered\r\nthe letter. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me! He _has_ told you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead his letter,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cIn justice to him, if you won\xe2\x80\x99t in\r\njustice to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe situation was too painful to be endured. Arnold looked at her, this\r\ntime, with a man\xe2\x80\x99s resolution in his eyes--spoke to her, this time, with\r\na man\xe2\x80\x99s resolution in his voice. She took the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a sudden humiliation of tone\r\nand manner, inexpressibly shocking, inexpressibly pitiable to see. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nunderstand my position at last. I am a woman doubly betrayed. Please to\r\nexcuse what I said to you just now, when I supposed myself to have some\r\nclaim on your respect. Perhaps you will grant me your pity? I can ask\r\nfor nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold was silent. Words were useless in the face of such utter\r\nself-abandonment as this. Any man living--even Geoffrey himself--must\r\nhave felt for her at that moment.\r\n\r\nShe looked for the first time at the letter. She opened it on the wrong\r\nside. \xe2\x80\x9cMy own letter!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the hands of another\r\nman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at the last page,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold.\r\n\r\nShe turned to the last page, and read the hurried penciled lines.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVillain! villain! villain!\xe2\x80\x9d At the third repetition of the word, she\r\ncrushed the letter in the palm of her hand, and flung it from her to the\r\nother end of the room. The instant after, the fire that had flamed up in\r\nher died out. Feebly and slowly she reached out her hand to the nearest\r\nchair, and sat down in it with her back to Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has deserted me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n was all she said. The words fell low and quiet on the silence: they were\r\nthe utterance of an immeasurable despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, indeed you are wrong! It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno excuse--it\xe2\x80\x99s the truth. I was present when the message came about his\r\nfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe never heeded him, and never moved. She only repeated the words\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has deserted me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take it in that way!\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Arnold--\xe2\x80\x9cpray don\xe2\x80\x99t! It\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful\r\nto hear you; it is indeed. I am sure he has _not_ deserted you.\xe2\x80\x9d There\r\nwas no answer; no sign that she heard him; she sat there, struck to\r\nstone. It was impossible to call the landlady in at such a moment as\r\nthis. In despair of knowing how else to rouse her, Arnold drew a chair\r\nto her side, and patted her timidly on the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in\r\nhis single-hearted, boyish way. \xe2\x80\x9cCheer up a little!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe slowly turned her head, and looked at him with a dull surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you say he had told you every thing?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you despise a woman like me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s heart went back, at that dreadful question, to the one woman\r\nwho was eternally sacred to him--to the woman from whose bosom he had\r\ndrawn the breath of life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes the man live,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwho can think of his mother--and despise\r\nwomen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat answer set the prisoned misery in her free. She gave him her\r\nhand--she faintly thanked him. The merciful tears came to her at last.\r\n\r\nArnold rose, and turned away to the window in despair. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean well,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet I only distress her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe heard him, and straggled to compose herself \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\ncomfort me. Don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my crying--I\xe2\x80\x99m the better for it.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked\r\nround at him gratefully. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t distress you, Mr. Brinkworth. I ought\r\nto thank you--and I do. Come back or I shall think you are angry with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d Arnold went back to her. She gave him her hand once more. \xe2\x80\x9cOne\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand people all at once,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, simply. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you\r\nwere like other men--I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know till to-day how kind you could be.\r\nDid you walk here?\xe2\x80\x9d she added, suddenly, with an effort to change\r\nthe subject. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you tired? I have not been kindly received at this\r\nplace--but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I may offer you whatever the inn affords.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was impossible not to feel for her--it was impossible not to be\r\ninterested in her. Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s honest longing to help her expressed itself\r\na little too openly when he spoke next. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I want, Miss Silvester, is\r\nto be of some service to you, if I can,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there any thing\r\nI can do to make your position here more comfortable? You will stay at\r\nthis place, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? Geoffrey wishes it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shuddered, and looked away. \xe2\x80\x9cYes! yes!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, hurriedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will hear from Geoffrey,\xe2\x80\x9d Arnold went on, \xe2\x80\x9cto-morrow or next day. I\r\nknow he means to write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of him any more!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried out. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do\r\nyou think I can look you in the face--\xe2\x80\x9d Her cheeks flushed deep, and her\r\neyes rested on him with a momentary firmness. \xe2\x80\x9cMind this! I am his wife,\r\nif promises can make me his wife! He has pledged his word to me by all\r\nthat is sacred!\xe2\x80\x9d She checked herself impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I saying?\r\nWhat interest can _you_ have in this miserable state of things? Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet us talk of it! I have something else to say to you. Let us go back\r\nto my troubles here. Did you see the landlady when you came in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I only saw the waiter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe landlady has made some absurd difficulty about letting me have\r\nthese rooms because I came here alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe won\xe2\x80\x99t make any difficulty now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cI have settled that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold smiled. After what had passed, it was an indescribable relief to\r\nhim to see the humorous side of his own position at the inn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I asked for the lady who had arrived\r\nhere alone this afternoon--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was told, in your interests, to ask for her as my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne looked at him--in alarm as well as in surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou asked for me as your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t done wrong--have I? As I understood it, there was\r\nno alternative. Geoffrey told me you had settled with him to present\r\nyourself here as a married lady, whose husband was coming to join her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought of _him_ when I said that. I never thought of _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNatural enough. Still, it comes to the same thing (doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?) with\r\nthe people of this house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will try and explain myself a little better. Geoffrey said your\r\nposition here depended on my asking for you at the door (as _he_ would\r\nhave asked for you if he had come) in the character of your husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had no right to say that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo right? After what you have told me of the landlady, just think\r\nwhat might have happened if he had _not_ said it! I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had much\r\nexperience myself of these things. But--allow me to ask--wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\nhave been a little awkward (at my age) if I had come here and inquired\r\nfor you as a friend? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think, in that case, the landlady might\r\nhave made some additional difficulty about letting you have the rooms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was beyond dispute that the landlady would have refused to let the\r\nrooms at all. It was equally plain that the deception which Arnold\r\nhad practiced on the people of the inn was a deception which Anne had\r\nherself rendered necessary, in her own interests. She was not to blame;\r\nit was clearly impossible for her to have foreseen such an event as\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s departure for London. Still, she felt an uneasy sense\r\nof responsibility--a vague dread of what might happen next. She sat\r\nnervously twisting her handkerchief in her lap, and made no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I object to this little stratagem,\xe2\x80\x9d Arnold went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nserving my old friend, and I am helping the lady who is soon to be his\r\nwife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne rose abruptly to her feet, and amazed him by a very unexpected\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Brinkworth,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cforgive me the rudeness of something I am\r\nabout to say to you. When are you going away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I am quite sure I can do nothing more to assist you,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t think of _me_ any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn your situation! who else am I to think of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne laid her hand earnestly on his arm, and answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlanche!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlanche?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Arnold, utterly at a loss to understand her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--Blanche. She found time to tell me what had passed between you\r\nthis morning before I left Windygates. I know you have made her an\r\noffer: I know you are engaged to be married to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold was delighted to hear it. He had been merely unwilling to leave\r\nher thus far. He was absolutely determined to stay with her now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t expect me to go after that!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cCome and sit down again,\r\nand let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about Blanche.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne declined impatiently, by a gesture. Arnold was too deeply\r\ninterested in the new topic to take any notice of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know all about her habits and her tastes,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cand what\r\nshe likes, and what she dislikes. It\xe2\x80\x99s most important that I should talk\r\nto you about her. When we are husband and wife, Blanche is to have\r\nall her own way in every thing. That\xe2\x80\x99s my idea of the Whole Duty of\r\nMan--when Man is married. You are still standing? Let me give you a\r\nchair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was cruel--under other circumstances it would have been\r\nimpossible--to disappoint him. But the vague fear of consequences which\r\nhad taken possession of Anne was not to be trifled with. She had no\r\nclear conception of the risk (and it is to be added, in justice to\r\nGeoffrey, that _he_ had no clear conception of the risk) on which\r\nArnold had unconsciously ventured, in undertaking his errand to the inn.\r\nNeither of them had any adequate idea (few people have) of the infamous\r\nabsence of all needful warning, of all decent precaution and restraint,\r\nwhich makes the marriage law of Scotland a trap to catch unmarried men\r\nand women, to this day. But, while Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s mind was incapable of\r\nlooking beyond the present emergency, Anne\xe2\x80\x99s finer intelligence told her\r\nthat a country which offered such facilities for private marriage as the\r\nfacilities of which she had proposed to take advantage in her own case,\r\nwas not a country in which a man could act as Arnold had acted, without\r\ndanger of some serious embarrassment following as the possible result.\r\nWith this motive to animate her, she resolutely declined to take the\r\noffered chair, or to enter into the proposed conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever we have to say about Blanche, Mr. Brinkworth, must be said at\r\nsome fitter time. I beg you will leave me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Leave me to the solitude that is best for me, and to the sorrow\r\nthat I have deserved. Thank you--and good-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold made no attempt to disguise his disappointment and surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I must go, I must,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut why are you in such a hurry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to call me your wife again before the people of this\r\ninn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs _that_ all? What on earth are you afraid of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was unable fully to realize her own apprehensions. She was doubly\r\nunable to express them in words. In her anxiety to produce some reason\r\nwhich might prevail on him to go, she drifted back into that very\r\nconversation about Blanche into which she had declined to enter but the\r\nmoment before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have reasons for being afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOne that I can\xe2\x80\x99t give; and\r\none that I can. Suppose Blanche heard of what you have done? The longer\r\nyou stay here--the more people you see--the more chance there is that\r\nshe _might_ hear of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what if she did?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arnold, in his own straightforward way. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou think she would be angry with me for making myself useful to _you?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Anne, sharply, \xe2\x80\x9cif she was jealous of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s unlimited belief in Blanche expressed itself, without the\r\nslightest compromise, in two words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnxious as she was, miserable as she was, a faint smile flitted over\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick would tell you, Mr. Brinkworth, that nothing is impossible\r\nwhere women are concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d She dropped her momentary lightness of tone,\r\nand went on as earnestly as ever. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t put yourself in Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplace--I can. Once more, I beg you to go. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like your coming here,\r\nin this way! I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it at all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand to take leave. At the same moment there was a loud\r\nknock at the door of the room.\r\n\r\nAnne sank into the chair at her side, and uttered a faint cry of alarm.\r\nArnold, perfectly impenetrable to all sense of his position, asked what\r\nthere was to frighten her--and answered the knock in the two customary\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE TENTH.\r\n\r\nMR. BISHOPRIGGS.\r\n\r\nTHE knock at the door was repeated--a louder knock than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you deaf?\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Arnold.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, little by little, an inch at a time. Mr. Bishopriggs\r\nappeared mysteriously, with the cloth for dinner over his arm, and with\r\nhis second in command behind him, bearing \xe2\x80\x9cthe furnishing of the table\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n (as it was called at Craig Fernie) on a tray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the deuce were you waiting for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you to come\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _I_ tauld _you,_\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Bishopriggs, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I wadna come in\r\nwithout knocking first. Eh, man!\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, dismissing his second in\r\ncommand, and laying the cloth with his own venerable hands, \xe2\x80\x9cd\xe2\x80\x99ye think\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve lived in this hottle in blinded eegnorance of hoo young married\r\ncouples pass the time when they\xe2\x80\x99re left to themselves? Twa knocks at the\r\ndoor--and an unco trouble in opening it, after that--is joost the least\r\nye can do for them! Whar\xe2\x80\x99 do ye think, noo, I\xe2\x80\x99ll set the places for you\r\nand your leddy there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne walked away to the window, in undisguised disgust. Arnold found Mr.\r\nBishopriggs to be quite irresistible. He answered, humoring the joke,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne at the top and one at the bottom of the table, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne at tap and one at bottom?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Bishopriggs, in high\r\ndisdain. \xe2\x80\x9cDe\xe2\x80\x99il a bit of it! Baith yer chairs as close together as\r\nchairs can be. Hech! hech!--haven\xe2\x80\x99t I caught \xe2\x80\x98em, after goodness knows\r\nhoo many preleeminary knocks at the door, dining on their husbands\xe2\x80\x99\r\nknees, and steemulating a man\xe2\x80\x99s appetite by feeding him at the fork\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nend like a child? Eh!\xe2\x80\x9d sighed the sage of Craig Fernie, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a short\r\nlife wi\xe2\x80\x99 that nuptial business, and a merry one! A mouth for yer billin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand cooin\xe2\x80\x99; and a\xe2\x80\x99 the rest o\xe2\x80\x99 yer days for wondering ye were ever such\r\na fule, and wishing it was a\xe2\x80\x99 to be done ower again.--Ye\xe2\x80\x99ll be for a\r\nbottle o\xe2\x80\x99 sherry wine, nae doot? and a drap toddy afterwards, to do yer\r\ndigestin\xe2\x80\x99 on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold nodded--and then, in obedience to a signal from Anne, joined her\r\nat the window. Mr. Bishopriggs looked after them attentively--observed\r\nthat they were talking in whispers--and approved of that proceeding, as\r\nrepresenting another of the established customs of young married couples\r\nat inns, in the presence of third persons appointed to wait on them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! ay!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking over his shoulder at Arnold, \xe2\x80\x9cgae to your\r\ndeerie! gae to your deerie! and leave a\xe2\x80\x99 the solid business o\xe2\x80\x99 life to\r\nMe. Ye\xe2\x80\x99ve Screepture warrant for it. A man maun leave fether and mother\r\n(I\xe2\x80\x99m yer fether), and cleave to his wife. My certie! \xe2\x80\x98cleave\xe2\x80\x99 is\r\na strong word--there\xe2\x80\x99s nae sort o\xe2\x80\x99 doot aboot it, when it comes\r\nto \xe2\x80\x98cleaving!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d He wagged his head thoughtfully, and walked to the\r\nside-table in a corner, to cut the bread.\r\n\r\nAs he took up the knife, his one wary eye detected a morsel of crumpled\r\npaper, lying lost between the table and the wall. It was the letter from\r\nGeoffrey, which Anne had flung from her, in the first indignation of\r\nreading it--and which neither she nor Arnold had thought of since.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that I see yonder?\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Mr. Bishopriggs, under his breath.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMair litter in the room, after I\xe2\x80\x99ve doosted and tidied it wi\xe2\x80\x99 my ain\r\nhands!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe picked up the crumpled paper, and partly opened it. \xe2\x80\x9cEh! what\xe2\x80\x99s here?\r\nWriting on it in ink? and writing on it in pencil? Who may this belong\r\nto?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked round cautiously toward Arnold and Anne. They were both\r\nstill talking in whispers, and both standing with their backs to him,\r\nlooking out of the window. \xe2\x80\x9cHere it is, clean forgotten and dune with!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n thought Mr. Bishopriggs. \xe2\x80\x9cNoo what would a fule do, if he fund this?\r\nA fule wad light his pipe wi\xe2\x80\x99 it, and then wonder whether he wadna ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndune better to read it first. And what wad a wise man do, in a seemilar\r\nposition?\xe2\x80\x9d He practically answered that question by putting the letter\r\ninto his pocket. It might be worth keeping, or it might not; five\r\nminutes\xe2\x80\x99 private examination of it would decide the alternative, at the\r\nfirst convenient opportunity. \xe2\x80\x9cAm gaun\xe2\x80\x99 to breeng the dinner in!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncalled out to Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, mind ye, there\xe2\x80\x99s nae knocking at the door\r\npossible, when I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the tray in baith my hands, and mairs the pity,\r\nthe gout in baith my feet.\xe2\x80\x9d With that friendly warning, Mr. Bishopriggs\r\nwent his way to the regions of the kitchen.\r\n\r\nArnold continued his conversation with Anne in terms which showed that\r\nthe question of his leaving the inn had been the question once more\r\ndiscussed between them while they were standing at the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see we can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe waiter has gone to bring the\r\ndinner in. What will they think in the house, if I go away already, and\r\nleave \xe2\x80\x98my wife\xe2\x80\x99 to dine alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was so plainly necessary to keep up appearances for the present,\r\nthat there was nothing more to be said. Arnold was committing a\r\nserious imprudence--and yet, on this occasion, Arnold was right. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nannoyance at feeling that conclusion forced on her produced the first\r\nbetrayal of impatience which she had shown yet. She left Arnold at the\r\nwindow, and flung herself on the sofa. \xe2\x80\x9cA curse seems to follow me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she thought, bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cThis will end ill--and I shall be answerable for\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Mr. Bishopriggs had found the dinner in the kitchen,\r\nready, and waiting for him. Instead of at once taking the tray on which\r\nit was placed into the sitting-room, he conveyed it privately into his\r\nown pantry, and shut the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLie ye there, my freend, till the spare moment comes--and I\xe2\x80\x99ll look\r\nat ye again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, putting the letter away carefully in the\r\ndresser-drawer. \xe2\x80\x9cNoo aboot the dinner o\xe2\x80\x99 they twa turtle-doves in the\r\nparlor?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, directing his attention to the dinner tray. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmaun joost see that the cook\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98s dune her duty--the creatures are no\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncapable o\xe2\x80\x99 decidin\xe2\x80\x99 that knotty point for their ain selves.\xe2\x80\x9d He took off\r\none of the covers, and picked bits, here and there, out of the dish with\r\nthe fork, \xe2\x80\x9cEh! eh! the collops are no\xe2\x80\x99 that bad!\xe2\x80\x9d He took off another\r\ncover, and shook his head in solemn doubt. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the green meat. I\r\ndoot green meat\xe2\x80\x99s windy diet for a man at my time o\xe2\x80\x99 life!\xe2\x80\x9d He put the\r\ncover on again, and tried the next dish. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fesh? What the de\xe2\x80\x99il does\r\nthe woman fry the trout for? Boil it next time, ye betch, wi\xe2\x80\x99 a pinch\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 saut and a spunefu\xe2\x80\x99 o\xe2\x80\x99 vinegar.\xe2\x80\x9d He drew the cork from a bottle of\r\nsherry, and decanted the wine. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sherry wine?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in tones of\r\ndeep feeling, holding the decanter up to the light. \xe2\x80\x9cHoo do I know but\r\nwhat it may be corkit? I maun taste and try. It\xe2\x80\x99s on my conscience,\r\nas an honest man, to taste and try.\xe2\x80\x9d He forthwith relieved his\r\nconscience--copiously. There was a vacant space, of no inconsiderable\r\ndimensions, left in the decanter. Mr. Bishopriggs gravely filled it up\r\nfrom the water-bottle. \xe2\x80\x9cEh! it\xe2\x80\x99s joost addin\xe2\x80\x99 ten years to the age\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 the wine. The turtle-doves will be nane the waur--and I mysel\xe2\x80\x99 am\r\na glass o\xe2\x80\x99 sherry the better. Praise Providence for a\xe2\x80\x99 its maircies!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Having relieved himself of that devout aspiration, he took up the tray\r\nagain, and decided on letting the turtle-doves have their dinner.\r\n\r\nThe conversation in the parlor (dropped for the moment) had been\r\nrenewed, in the absence of Mr. Bishopriggs. Too restless to remain\r\nlong in one place, Anne had risen again from the sofa, and had rejoined\r\nArnold at the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere do your friends at Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s believe you to be now?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked, abruptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am believed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Arnold, \xe2\x80\x9cto be meeting my tenants, and taking\r\npossession of my estate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you to get to your estate to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy railway, I suppose. By-the-by, what excuse am I to make for going\r\naway after dinner? We are sure to have the landlady in here before long.\r\nWhat will she say to my going off by myself to the train, and leaving\r\n\xe2\x80\x98my wife\xe2\x80\x99 behind me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Brinkworth! that joke--if it _is_ a joke--is worn out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may leave your excuse to me,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you go by the up\r\ntrain, or the down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the up train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door opened suddenly; and Mr. Bishopriggs appeared with the dinner.\r\nAnne nervously separated herself from Arnold. The one available eye of\r\nMr. Bishopriggs followed her reproachfully, as he put the dishes on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI warned ye baith, it was a clean impossibility to knock at the door\r\nthis time. Don\xe2\x80\x99t blame me, young madam--don\xe2\x80\x99t blame _me!\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere will you sit?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arnold, by way of diverting Anne\xe2\x80\x99s attention\r\nfrom the familiarities of Father Bishopriggs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny where!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, impatiently; snatching up a chair, and\r\nplacing it at the bottom of the table.\r\n\r\nMr. Bishopriggs politely, but firmly, put the chair back again in its\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord\xe2\x80\x99s sake! what are ye doin\xe2\x80\x99? It\xe2\x80\x99s clean contrary to a\xe2\x80\x99 the laws\r\nand customs o\xe2\x80\x99 the honey-mune, to sit as far away from your husband as\r\nthat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waved his persuasive napkin to one of the two chairs placed close\r\ntogether at the table.\r\n\r\nArnold interfered once more, and prevented another outbreak of\r\nimpatience from Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet the man have his way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet it over as soon as you can,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t, and won\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nbear it much longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey took their places at the table, with Father Bishopriggs behind\r\nthem, in the mixed character of major domo and guardian angel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the trout!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, taking the cover off with a flourish.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf an hour since, he was loupin\xe2\x80\x99 in the water. There he lies noo,\r\nfried in the dish. An emblem o\xe2\x80\x99 human life for ye! When ye can spare any\r\nleisure time from yer twa selves, meditate on that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold took up the spoon, to give Anne one of the trout. Mr. Bishopriggs\r\nclapped the cover on the dish again, with a countenance expressive of\r\ndevout horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there naebody gaun\xe2\x80\x99 to say grace?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! come!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fish is getting cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bishopriggs piously closed his available eye, and held the cover\r\nfirmly on the dish. \xe2\x80\x9cFor what ye\xe2\x80\x99re gaun\xe2\x80\x99 to receive, may ye baith be\r\ntruly thankful!\xe2\x80\x9d He opened his available eye, and whipped the cover off\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cMy conscience is easy noo. Fall to! Fall to!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend him away!\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cHis familiarity is beyond all endurance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t wait,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! but I\xe2\x80\x99m here to wait,\xe2\x80\x9d objected Mr. Bishopriggs. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmy gaun\xe2\x80\x99 away, when ye\xe2\x80\x99ll want me anon to change the plates for ye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He considered for a moment (privately consulting his experience) and\r\narrived at a satisfactory conclusion as to Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s motive for wanting\r\nto get rid of him. \xe2\x80\x9cTak\xe2\x80\x99 her on yer knee,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered in Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s\r\near, \xe2\x80\x9cas soon as ye like! Feed him at the fork\xe2\x80\x99s end,\xe2\x80\x9d he added to Anne,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhenever ye please! I\xe2\x80\x99ll think of something else, and look out at the\r\nproaspect.\xe2\x80\x9d He winked--and went to the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! come!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold to Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a comic side to all this.\r\nTry and see it as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bishopriggs returned from the window, and announced the appearance\r\nof a new element of embarrassment in the situation at the inn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy certie!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s weel ye cam\xe2\x80\x99 when ye did. It\xe2\x80\x99s ill getting\r\nto this hottle in a storm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne started and looked round at him. \xe2\x80\x9cA storm coming!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! ye\xe2\x80\x99re well hoosed here--ye needn\xe2\x80\x99t mind it. There\xe2\x80\x99s the cloud down\r\nthe valley,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, pointing out of the window, \xe2\x80\x9ccoming up one way,\r\nwhen the wind\xe2\x80\x99s blawing the other. The storm\xe2\x80\x99s brewing, my leddy, when\r\nye see that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was another knock at the door. As Arnold had predicted, the\r\nlandlady made her appearance on the scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ha\xe2\x80\x99 just lookit in, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Inchbare, addressing herself\r\nexclusively to Arnold, \xe2\x80\x9cto see ye\xe2\x80\x99ve got what ye want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you are the landlady? Very nice, ma\xe2\x80\x99am--very nice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMistress Inchbare had her own private motive for entering the room, and\r\ncame to it without further preface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d she proceeded. \xe2\x80\x9cI wasna in the way when ye cam\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhere, or I suld ha\xe2\x80\x99 made bauld to ask ye the question which I maun e\xe2\x80\x99en\r\nask noo. Am I to understand that ye hire these rooms for yersel\xe2\x80\x99, and\r\nthis leddy here--yer wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne raised her head to speak. Arnold pressed her hand warningly, under\r\nthe table, and silenced her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI take the rooms for myself, and this lady\r\nhere--my wife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne made a second attempt to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis gentleman--\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\r\n\r\nArnold stopped her for the second time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Inchbare, with a broad stare of\r\nsurprise. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only a puir woman, my leddy--d\xe2\x80\x99ye mean yer husband here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s warning hand touched Anne\xe2\x80\x99s, for the third time. Mistress\r\nInchbare\xe2\x80\x99s eyes remained fixed on her in merciless inquiry. To have\r\ngiven utterance to the contradiction which trembled on her lips would\r\nhave been to involve Arnold (after all that he had sacrificed for her)\r\nin the scandal which would inevitably follow--a scandal which would be\r\ntalked of in the neighborhood, and which might find its way to Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nears. White and cold, her eyes never moving from the table, she accepted\r\nthe landlady\xe2\x80\x99s implied correction, and faintly repeated the words: \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nhusband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMistress Inchbare drew a breath of virtuous relief, and waited for what\r\nAnne had to say next. Arnold came considerately to the rescue, and got\r\nher out of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Anne; \xe2\x80\x9cI know what it is, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll see about\r\nit. She\xe2\x80\x99s always like this, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, when a storm\xe2\x80\x99s coming,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on,\r\nturning to the landlady. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you--I know how to manage her. Well\r\nsend to you, if we want your assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt yer ain pleasure, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mistress Inchbare. She turned, and\r\napologized to Anne (under protest), with a stiff courtesy. \xe2\x80\x9cNo offense,\r\nmy leddy! Ye\xe2\x80\x99ll remember that ye cam\xe2\x80\x99 here alane, and that the hottle\r\nhas its ain gude name to keep up.\xe2\x80\x9d Having once more vindicated \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nhottle,\xe2\x80\x9d she made the long-desired move to the door, and left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m faint!\xe2\x80\x9d Anne whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me some water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no water on the table. Arnold ordered it of Mr.\r\nBishopriggs--who had remained passive in the back-ground (a model of\r\ndiscreet attention) as long as the mistress was in the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Brinkworth!\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, when they were alone, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are acting with\r\ninexcusable rashness. That woman\xe2\x80\x99s question was an impertinence. Why did\r\nyou answer it? Why did you force me--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped, unable to finish the sentence. Arnold insisted on her\r\ndrinking a glass of wine--and then defended himself with the patient\r\nconsideration for her which he had shown from the first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t I have the inn door shut in your face\xe2\x80\x9d--he asked, good\r\nhumoredly--\xe2\x80\x9cwith a storm coming on, and without a place in which you can\r\ntake refuge? No, no, Miss Silvester! I don\xe2\x80\x99t presume to blame you for\r\nany scruples you may feel--but scruples are sadly out of place with such\r\na woman as that landlady. I am responsible for your safety to Geoffrey;\r\nand Geoffrey expects to find you here. Let\xe2\x80\x99s change the subject. The\r\nwater is a long time coming. Try another glass of wine. No? Well--here\r\nis Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s health\xe2\x80\x9d (he took some of the wine himself), \xe2\x80\x9cin the\r\nweakest sherry I ever drank in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d As he set down his glass,\r\nMr. Bishopriggs came in with the water. Arnold hailed him satirically.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? have you got the water? or have you used it all for the sherry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bishopriggs stopped in the middle of the room, thunder-struck at the\r\naspersion cast on the wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the way ye talk of the auldest bottle o\xe2\x80\x99 sherry wine in\r\nScotland?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the warld coming to? The new\r\ngeneration\xe2\x80\x99s a foot beyond my fathoming. The maircies o\xe2\x80\x99 Providence, as\r\nshown to man in the choicest veentages o\xe2\x80\x99 Spain, are clean thrown away\r\non \xe2\x80\x98em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you brought the water?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ha\xe2\x80\x99 brought the water--and mair than the water. I ha\xe2\x80\x99 brought ye\r\nnews from ootside. There\xe2\x80\x99s a company o\xe2\x80\x99 gentlemen on horseback, joost\r\ncantering by to what they ca\xe2\x80\x99 the shootin\xe2\x80\x99 cottage, a mile from this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--and what have we got to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBide a wee! There\xe2\x80\x99s ane o\xe2\x80\x99 them has drawn bridle at the hottle, and\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s speerin\xe2\x80\x99 after the leddy that cam\xe2\x80\x99 here alane. The leddy\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nleddy, as sure as saxpence. I doot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bishopriggs, walking away\r\nto the window, \xe2\x80\x9c_that\xe2\x80\x99s_ what ye\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold looked at Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you expect any body?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it Geoffrey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible. Geoffrey is on his way to London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he is, any way,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Mr. Bishopriggs, at the window. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nloupin\xe2\x80\x99 down from his horse. He\xe2\x80\x99s turning this way. Lord save us!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nexclaimed, with a start of consternation, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do I see? That incarnate\r\ndeevil, Sir Paitrick himself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean Sir Patrick Lundie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne ran to the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _is_ Sir Patrick!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHide yourself before he comes in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHide myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will he think if he sees you with _me?\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nHe was Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s guardian, and he believed Arnold to be at that moment\r\nvisiting his new property. What he would think was not difficult to\r\nforesee. Arnold turned for help to Mr. Bishopriggs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere can I go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bishopriggs pointed to the bedroom door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhar\xe2\x80\x99 can ye go? There\xe2\x80\x99s the nuptial chamber!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bishopriggs expressed the utmost extremity of human amazement by a\r\nlong whistle, on one note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhew! Is that the way ye talk o\xe2\x80\x99 the nuptial chamber already?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFind me some other place--I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it worth your while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! there\xe2\x80\x99s my paintry! I trow that\xe2\x80\x99s some other place; and the door\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nat the end o\xe2\x80\x99 the passage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold hurried out. Mr. Bishopriggs--evidently under the impression that\r\nthe case before him was a case of elopement, with Sir Patrick mixed\r\nup in it in the capacity of guardian--addressed himself, in friendly\r\nconfidence, to Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy certie, mistress! it\xe2\x80\x99s ill wark deceivin\xe2\x80\x99 Sir Paitrick, if that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat ye\xe2\x80\x99ve dune. Ye must know, I was ance a bit clerk body in his\r\nchambers at Embro--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice of Mistress Inchbare, calling for the head-waiter, rose shrill\r\nand imperative from the regions of the bar. Mr. Bishopriggs disappeared.\r\nAnne remained, standing helpless by the window. It was plain by this\r\ntime that the place of her retreat had been discovered at Windygates.\r\nThe one doubt to decide, now, was whether it would be wise or not to\r\nreceive Sir Patrick, for the purpose of discovering whether he came as\r\nfriend or enemy to the inn.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE ELEVENTH.\r\n\r\nSIR PATRICK.\r\n\r\nTHE doubt was practically decided before Anne had determined what to do.\r\nShe was still at the window when the sitting-room door was thrown open,\r\nand Sir Patrick appeared, obsequiously shown in by Mr. Bishopriggs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99re kindly welcome, Sir Paitrick. Hech, Sirs! the sight of you is\r\ngude for sair eyne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick turned and looked at Mr. Bishopriggs--as he might have\r\nlooked at some troublesome insect which he had driven out of the window,\r\nand which had returned on him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you scoundrel! have you drifted into an honest employment at\r\nlast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bishopriggs rubbed his hands cheerfully, and took his tone from his\r\nsuperior, with supple readiness,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99re always in the right of it, Sir Paitrick! Wut, raal wut in that\r\naboot the honest employment, and me drifting into it. Lord\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Sir,\r\nhoo well ye wear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDismissing Mr. Bishopriggs by a sign, Sir Patrick advanced to Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am committing an intrusion, madam which must, I am afraid, appear\r\nunpardonable in your eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I hope you will excuse me when\r\nI have made you acquainted with my motive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke with scrupulous politeness. His knowledge of Anne was of the\r\nslightest possible kind. Like other men, he had felt the attraction of\r\nher unaffected grace and gentleness on the few occasions when he had\r\nbeen in her company--and that was all. If he had belonged to the present\r\ngeneration he would, under the circumstances, have fallen into one of\r\nthe besetting sins of England in these days--the tendency (to borrow an\r\nillustration from the stage) to \xe2\x80\x9cstrike an attitude\xe2\x80\x9d in the presence\r\nof a social emergency. A man of the present period, in Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nposition, would have struck an attitude of (what is called) chivalrous\r\nrespect; and would have addressed Anne in a tone of ready-made sympathy,\r\nwhich it was simply impossible for a stranger really to feel. Sir\r\nPatrick affected nothing of the sort. One of the besetting sins of _his_\r\ntime was the habitual concealment of our better selves--upon the whole,\r\na far less dangerous national error than the habitual advertisement of\r\nour better selves, which has become the practice, public and privately,\r\nof society in this age. Sir Patrick assumed, if anything, less sympathy\r\non this occasion than he really felt. Courteous to all women, he was as\r\ncourteous as usual to Anne--and no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite at a loss, Sir, to know what brings you to this place. The\r\nservant here informs me that you are one of a party of gentlemen who\r\nhave just passed by the inn, and who have all gone on except yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n In those guarded terms Anne opened the interview with the unwelcome\r\nvisitor, on her side.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick admitted the fact, without betraying the slightest\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe servant is quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am one of the party. And I\r\nhave purposely allowed them to go on to the keeper\xe2\x80\x99s cottage without\r\nme. Having admitted this, may I count on receiving your permission to\r\nexplain the motive of my visit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNecessarily suspicious of him, as coming from Windygates, Anne answered\r\nin few and formal words, as coldly as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain it, Sir Patrick, if you please, as briefly as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick bowed. He was not in the least offended; he was even (if the\r\nconfession may be made without degrading him in the public estimation)\r\nprivately amused. Conscious of having honestly presented himself at the\r\ninn in Anne\xe2\x80\x99s interests, as well as in the interests of the ladies at\r\nWindygates, it appealed to his sense of humor to find himself kept\r\nat arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length by the very woman whom he had come to benefit. The\r\ntemptation was strong on him to treat his errand from his own whimsical\r\npoint of view. He gravely took out his watch, and noted the time to a\r\nsecond, before he spoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have an event to relate in which you are interested,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nI have two messages to deliver, which I hope you will not object to\r\nreceive. The event I undertake to describe in one minute. The messages\r\nI promise to dispose of in two minutes more. Total duration of this\r\nintrusion on your time--three minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe placed a chair for Anne, and waited until she had permitted him, by a\r\nsign, to take a second chair for himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will begin with the event,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cYour arrival at this place\r\nis no secret at Windygates. You were seen on the foot-road to Craig\r\nFernie by one of the female servants. And the inference naturally drawn\r\nis, that you were on your way to the inn. It may be important for you to\r\nknow this; and I have taken the liberty of mentioning it accordingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He consulted his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cEvent related. Time, one minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had excited her curiosity, to begin with. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich of the women saw\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, impulsively.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick (watch in hand) declined to prolong the interview by\r\nanswering any incidental inquiries which might arise in the course of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined; \xe2\x80\x9cI am pledged to occupy three minutes only. I\r\nhave no room for the woman. With your kind permission, I will get on to\r\nthe messages next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne remained silent. Sir Patrick went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst message: \xe2\x80\x98Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s compliments to her step-daughter\xe2\x80\x99s late\r\ngoverness--with whose married name she is not acquainted. Lady Lundie\r\nregrets to say that Sir Patrick, as head of the family, has threatened\r\nto return to Edinburgh, unless she consents to be guided by his\r\nadvice in the course she pursues with the late governess. Lady Lundie,\r\naccordingly, foregoes her intention of calling at the Craig Fernie inn,\r\nto express her sentiments and make her inquiries in person, and commits\r\nto Sir Patrick the duty of expressing her sentiments; reserving to\r\nherself the right of making her inquiries at the next convenient\r\nopportunity. Through the medium of her brother-in-law, she begs to\r\ninform the late governess that all intercourse is at an end between\r\nthem, and that she declines to act as reference in case of future\r\nemergency.\xe2\x80\x99--Message textually correct. Expressive of Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s view\r\nof your sudden departure from the house. Time, two minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s color rose. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s pride was up in arms on the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe impertinence of Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s message is no more than I should\r\nhave expected from her,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am only surprised at Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndelivering it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s motives will appear presently,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the incorrigible\r\nold gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cSecond message: \xe2\x80\x98Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s fondest love. Is dying to\r\nbe acquainted with Anne\xe2\x80\x99s husband, and to be informed of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s married\r\nname. Feels indescribable anxiety and apprehension on Anne\xe2\x80\x99s account.\r\nInsists on hearing from Anne immediately. Longs, as she never longed\r\nfor any thing yet, to order her pony-chaise and drive full gallop to\r\nthe inn. Yields, under irresistible pressure, to t he exertion of her\r\nguardian\xe2\x80\x99s authority, and commits the expression of her feelings to Sir\r\nPatrick, who is a born tyrant, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least mind breaking\r\nother people\xe2\x80\x99s hearts.\xe2\x80\x99 Sir Patrick, speaking for himself, places his\r\nsister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s view and his niece\xe2\x80\x99s view, side by side, before the lady\r\nwhom he has now the honor of addressing, and on whose confidence he is\r\nespecially careful not to intrude. Reminds the lady that his influence\r\nat Windygates, however strenuously he may exert it, is not likely to\r\nlast forever. Requests her to consider whether his sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s view\r\nand his niece\xe2\x80\x99s view in collision, may not lead to very undesirable\r\ndomestic results; and leaves her to take the course which seems best to\r\nherself under those circumstances.--Second message delivered textually.\r\nTime, three minutes. A storm coming on. A quarter of an hour\xe2\x80\x99s ride from\r\nhere to the shooting-cottage. Madam, I wish you good-evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bowed lower than ever--and, without a word more, quietly left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s first impulse was (excusably enough, poor soul) an impulse of\r\nresentment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Sir Patrick!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a bitter look at the closing\r\ndoor. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sympathy of society with a friendless woman could hardly have\r\nbeen expressed in a more amusing way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little irritation of the moment passed off with the moment. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown intelligence and good sense showed her the position in its truer\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nShe recognized in Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s abrupt departure Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconsiderate resolution to spare her from entering into any details on\r\nthe subject of her position at the inn. He had given her a friendly\r\nwarning; and he had delicately left her to decide for herself as to the\r\nassistance which she might render him in maintaining tranquillity at\r\nWindygates. She went at once to a side-table in the room, on which\r\nwriting materials were placed, and sat down to write to Blanche.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can do nothing with Lady Lundie,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have more\r\ninfluence than any body else over Blanche and I can prevent the\r\ncollision between them which Sir Patrick dreads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began the letter. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dearest Blanche, I have seen Sir Patrick, and\r\nhe has given me your message. I will set your mind at ease about me as\r\nsoon as I can. But, before I say any thing else, let me entreat you,\r\nas the greatest favor you can do to your sister and your friend, not to\r\nenter into any disputes about me with Lady Lundie, and not to commit\r\nthe imprudence--the useless imprudence, my love--of coming here.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nstopped--the paper swam before her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cMy own darling!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwho could have foreseen that I should ever shrink from the thought of\r\nseeing _you?\xe2\x80\x9d_ She sighed, and dipped the pen in the ink, and went on\r\nwith the letter.\r\n\r\nThe sky darkened rapidly as the evening fell. The wind swept in fainter\r\nand fainter gusts across the dreary moor. Far and wide over the face of\r\nNature the stillness was fast falling which tells of a coming storm.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE TWELFTH.\r\n\r\nARNOLD.\r\n\r\nMEANWHILE Arnold remained shut up in the head-waiter\xe2\x80\x99s pantry--chafing\r\nsecretly at the position forced upon him.\r\n\r\nHe was, for the first time in his life, in hiding from another person,\r\nand that person a man. Twice--stung to it by the inevitable loss of\r\nself-respect which his situation occasioned--he had gone to the door,\r\ndetermined to face Sir Patrick boldly; and twice he had abandoned the\r\nidea, in mercy to Anne. It would have been impossible for him to set\r\nhimself right with Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s guardian without betraying the unhappy\r\nwoman whose secret he was bound in honor to keep. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to Heaven I\r\nhad never come here!\xe2\x80\x9d was the useless aspiration that escaped him, as\r\nhe doggedly seated himself on the dresser to wait till Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeparture set him free.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval--not by any means the long interval which he had\r\nanticipated--his solitude was enlivened by the appearance of Father\r\nBishopriggs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Arnold, jumping off the dresser, \xe2\x80\x9cis the coast clear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were occasions when Mr. Bishopriggs became, on a sudden,\r\nunexpectedly hard of hearing, This was one of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoo do ye find the paintry?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, without paying the slightest\r\nattention to Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s question. \xe2\x80\x9cSnug and private? A Patmos in the\r\nweelderness, as ye may say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis one available eye, which had begun by looking at Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s face,\r\ndropped slowly downward, and fixed itself, in mute but eloquent\r\nexpectation, on Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s waistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cI promised to pay you for the Patmos--eh?\r\nThere you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bishopriggs pocketed the money with a dreary smile and a sympathetic\r\nshake of the head. Other waiters would have returned thanks. The sage\r\nof Craig Fernie returned a few brief remarks instead. Admirable in many\r\nthings, Father Bishopriggs was especially great at drawing a moral. He\r\ndrew a moral on this occasion from his own gratuity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere I am--as ye say. Mercy presairve us! ye need the siller at every\r\nturn, when there\xe2\x80\x99s a woman at yer heels. It\xe2\x80\x99s an awfu\xe2\x80\x99 reflection--ye\r\ncanna hae any thing to do wi\xe2\x80\x99 the sex they ca\xe2\x80\x99 the opposite sex without\r\nits being an expense to ye. There\xe2\x80\x99s this young leddy o\xe2\x80\x99 yours, I doot\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll ha\xe2\x80\x99 been an expense to ye from the first. When you were\r\ncoortin\xe2\x80\x99 her, ye did it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go bail, wi\xe2\x80\x99 the open hand. Presents and\r\nkeep-sakes, flowers and jewelery, and little dogues. Sair expenses all\r\nof them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang your reflections! Has Sir Patrick left the inn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reflections of Mr. Bishopriggs declined to be disposed of in any\r\nthing approaching to a summary way. On they flowed from their parent\r\nsource, as slowly and as smoothly as ever!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNoo ye\xe2\x80\x99re married to her, there\xe2\x80\x99s her bonnets and goons and\r\nunder-clothin\xe2\x80\x99--her ribbons, laces, furbelows, and fallals. A sair\r\nexpense again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the expense of cutting your reflections short, Mr.\r\nBishopriggs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirdly, and lastly, if ye canna agree wi\xe2\x80\x99 her as time gaes on--if\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s incompaitibeelity of temper betwixt ye--in short, if ye want a\r\nwee bit separation, hech, Sirs! ye pet yer hand in yer poaket, and come\r\nto an aimicable understandin\xe2\x80\x99 wi\xe2\x80\x99 her in that way. Or, maybe she takes\r\nye into Court, and pets _her_ hand in your poaket, and comes to a\r\nhoastile understandin\xe2\x80\x99 wi\xe2\x80\x99 ye there. Show me a woman--and I\xe2\x80\x99ll show ye\r\na man not far off wha\xe2\x80\x99 has mair expenses on his back than he ever\r\nbairgained for.\xe2\x80\x9d Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s patience would last no longer--he turned to\r\nthe door. Mr. Bishopriggs, with equal alacrity on his side, turned to\r\nthe matter in hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir! The room is e\xe2\x80\x99en clear o\xe2\x80\x99 Sir Paitrick,\r\nand the leddy\xe2\x80\x99s alane, and waitin\xe2\x80\x99 for ye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a moment more Arnold was back in the sitting-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, anxiously. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? Bad news from Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne closed and directed the letter to Blanche, which she had just\r\ncompleted. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing to interest _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did Sir Patrick want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly to warn me. They have found out at Windygates that I am here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s awkward, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least. I can manage perfectly; I have nothing to fear. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink of _me_--think of yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not suspected, am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank heaven--no. But there is no knowing what may happen if you stay\r\nhere. Ring the bell at once, and ask the waiter about the trains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStruck by the unusual obscurity of the sky at that hour of the evening,\r\nArnold went to the window. The rain had come--and was falling heavily.\r\nThe view on the moor was fast disappearing in mist and darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPleasant weather to travel in!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe railway!\xe2\x80\x9d Anne exclaimed, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s getting late. See\r\nabout the railway!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold walked to the fire-place to ring the bell. The railway time-table\r\nhanging over it met his eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the information I want,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Anne; \xe2\x80\x9cif I only knew how\r\nto get at it. \xe2\x80\x98Down\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98Up\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98A. M.\xe2\x80\x99--P. M.\xe2\x80\x99 What a cursed confusion! I\r\nbelieve they do it on purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne joined him at the fire-place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand it--I\xe2\x80\x99ll help you. Did you say it was the up train you\r\nwanted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the name of the station you stop at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold told her. She followed the intricate net-work of lines and\r\nfigures with her finger--suddenly stopped--looked again to make\r\nsure--and turned from the time-table with a face of blank despair. The\r\nlast train for the day had gone an hour since.\r\n\r\nIn the silence which followed that discovery, a first flash of lightning\r\npassed across the window and the low roll of thunder sounded the\r\noutbreak of the storm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s to be done now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arnold.\r\n\r\nIn the face of the storm, Anne answered without hesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cYou must\r\ntake a carriage, and drive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrive? They told me it was three-and-twenty miles, by railway, from\r\nthe station to my place--let alone the distance from this inn to the\r\nstation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does the distance matter? Mr. Brinkworth, you can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly stay\r\nhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA second flash of lightning crossed the window; the roll of the thunder\r\ncame nearer. Even Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s good temper began to be a little ruffled by\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s determination to get rid of him. He sat down with the air of a\r\nman who had made up his mind not to leave the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, as the sound of the thunder died away\r\ngrandly, and the hard pattering of the rain on the window became audible\r\nonce more. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I ordered horses, do you think they would let me have\r\nthem, in such weather as this? And, if they did, do you suppose the\r\nhorses could face it on the moor? No, no, Miss Silvester--I am sorry to\r\nbe in the way, but the train has gone, and the night and the storm have\r\ncome. I have no choice but to stay here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne still maintained her own view, but less resolutely than before.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter what you have told the landlady,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthink of the\r\nembarrassment, the cruel embarrassment of our position, if you stop at\r\nthe inn till to-morrow morning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Arnold.\r\n\r\nAnne looked up at him, quickly and angrily. No! he was quite unconscious\r\nof having said any thing that could offend her. His rough masculine\r\nsense broke its way unconsciously through all the little feminine\r\nsubtleties and delicacies of his companion, and looked the position\r\npractically in the face for what it was worth, and no more. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nembarrassment?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, pointing to the bedroom door. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nroom, all ready for you. And here\xe2\x80\x99s the sofa, in this room, all ready\r\nfor _me._ If you had seen the places I have slept in at sea--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe interrupted him, without ceremony. The places he had slept in, at\r\nsea, were of no earthly importance. The one question to consider, was\r\nthe place he was to sleep in that night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you must stay,\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t you get a room in some other\r\npart of the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut one last mistake in dealing with her, in her present nervous\r\ncondition, was left to make--and the innocent Arnold made it. \xe2\x80\x9cIn some\r\nother part of the house?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, jestingly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe landlady would be\r\nscandalized. Mr. Bishopriggs would never allow it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose, and stamped her foot impatiently on the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\njoke!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is no laughing matter.\xe2\x80\x9d She paced the room\r\nexcitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like it! I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold looked after her, with a stare of boyish wonder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat puts you out so?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it the storm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe threw herself on the sofa again. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, shortly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nstorm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s inexhaustible good-nature was at once roused to activity again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we have the candles,\xe2\x80\x9d he suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cand shut the weather out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She turned irritably on the sofa, without replying. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll promise to go\r\naway the first thing in the morning!\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cDo try and take it\r\neasy--and don\xe2\x80\x99t be angry with me. Come! come! you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t turn a dog\r\nout, Miss Silvester, on such a night as this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was irresistible. The most sensitive woman breathing could not\r\nhave accused him of failing toward her in any single essential of\r\nconsideration and respect. He wanted tact, poor fellow--but who could\r\nexpect him to have learned that always superficial (and sometimes\r\ndangerous) accomplishment, in the life he had led at sea? At the sight\r\nof his honest, pleading face, Anne recovered possession of her gentler\r\nand sweeter self. She made her excuses for her irritability with a grace\r\nthat enchanted him. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have a pleasant evening of it yet!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nArnold, in his hearty way--and rang the bell.\r\n\r\nThe bell was hung outside the door of that Patmos in the\r\nwilderness--otherwise known as the head-waiter\xe2\x80\x99s pantry. Mr. Bishopriggs\r\n(employing his brief leisure in the seclusion of his own apartment) had\r\njust mixed a glass of the hot and comforting liquor called \xe2\x80\x9ctoddy\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\nthe language of North Britain, and was just lifting it to his lips, when\r\nthe summons from Arnold invited him to leave his grog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaud yer screechin\xe2\x80\x99 tongue!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Bishopriggs, addressing the\r\nbell through the door. \xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99re waur than a woman when ye aince begin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bell--like the woman--went on again. Mr. Bishopriggs, equally\r\npertinacious, went on with his toddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! ay! ye may e\xe2\x80\x99en ring yer heart out--but ye won\xe2\x80\x99t part a Scotchman\r\nfrom his glass. It\xe2\x80\x99s maybe the end of their dinner they\xe2\x80\x99ll be wantin\xe2\x80\x99.\r\nSir Paitrick cam\xe2\x80\x99 in at the fair beginning of it, and spoilt the\r\ncollops, like the dour deevil he is!\xe2\x80\x9d The bell rang for the third time.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! ay! ring awa\xe2\x80\x99! I doot yon young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s little better than a\r\nbelly-god--there\xe2\x80\x99s a scandalous haste to comfort the carnal part o\xe2\x80\x99 him\r\nin a\xe2\x80\x99 this ringin\xe2\x80\x99! He knows naething o\xe2\x80\x99 wine,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr. Bishopriggs,\r\non whose mind Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s discovery of the watered sherry still dwelt\r\nunpleasantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lightning quickened, and lit the sitting-room horribly with its\r\nlurid glare; the thunder rolled nearer and nearer over the black gulf of\r\nthe moor. Arnold had just raised his hand to ring for the fourth time,\r\nwhen the inevitable knock was heard at the door. It was useless to say\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccome in.\xe2\x80\x9d The immutable laws of Bishopriggs had decided that a second\r\nknock was necessary. Storm or no storm, the second knock came--and\r\nthen, and not till then, the sage appeared, with the dish of untasted\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccollops\xe2\x80\x9d in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCandles!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold.\r\n\r\nMr. Bishopriggs set the \xe2\x80\x9ccollops\xe2\x80\x9d (in the language of England, minced\r\nmeat) upon the table, lit the candles on the mantle-piece, faced about\r\nwith the fire of recent toddy flaming in his nose, and waited for\r\nfurther orders, before he went back to his second glass. Anne declined\r\nto return to the dinner. Arnold ordered Mr. Bishopriggs to close the\r\nshutters, and sat down to dine by himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks greasy, and smells greasy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Anne, turning over the\r\ncollops with a spoon. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t be ten minutes dining. Will you have some\r\ntea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne declined again.\r\n\r\nArnold tried her once more. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we do to get through the\r\nevening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo what you like,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, resignedly.\r\n\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s mind was suddenly illuminated by an idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have got it!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll kill the time as our\r\ncabin-passengers used to kill it at sea.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked over his shoulder at\r\nMr. Bishopriggs. \xe2\x80\x9cWaiter! bring a pack of cards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that ye\xe2\x80\x99re wantin\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Bishopriggs, doubting the\r\nevidence of his own senses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA pack of cards,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Arnold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCairds?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Mr. Bishopriggs. \xe2\x80\x9cA pack o\xe2\x80\x99 cairds? The deevil\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nallegories in the deevil\xe2\x80\x99s own colors--red and black! I wunna execute\r\nyer order. For yer ain saul\xe2\x80\x99s sake, I wunna do it. Ha\xe2\x80\x99 ye lived to your\r\ntime o\xe2\x80\x99 life, and are ye no\xe2\x80\x99 awakened yet to the awfu\xe2\x80\x99 seenfulness o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngamblin\xe2\x80\x99 wi\xe2\x80\x99 the cairds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as you please,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will find me awakened--when\r\nI go away--to the awful folly of feeing a waiter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes that mean that ye\xe2\x80\x99re bent on the cairds?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Bishopriggs,\r\nsuddenly betraying signs of worldly anxiety in his look and manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--that means I am bent on the cards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tak\xe2\x80\x99 up my testimony against \xe2\x80\x98em--but I\xe2\x80\x99m no\xe2\x80\x99 telling ye that I canna\r\nlay my hand on \xe2\x80\x98em if I like. What do they say in my country? \xe2\x80\x98Him that\r\nwill to Coupar, maun to Coupar.\xe2\x80\x99 And what do they say in your country?\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Needs must when the deevil drives.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d With that excellent reason for\r\nturning his back on his own principles, Mr. Bishopriggs shuffled out of\r\nthe room to fetch the cards.\r\n\r\nThe dresser-drawer in the pantry contained a choice selection of\r\nmiscellaneous objects--a pack of cards being among them. In searching\r\nfor the cards, the wary hand of the head-waiter came in contact with a\r\nmorsel of crumpled-up paper. He drew it out, and recognized the letter\r\nwhich he had picked up in the sitting-room some hours since.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! ay! I\xe2\x80\x99ll do weel, I trow, to look at this while my mind\xe2\x80\x99s runnin\xe2\x80\x99\r\non it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bishopriggs. \xe2\x80\x9cThe cairds may e\xe2\x80\x99en find their way to the\r\nparlor by other hands than mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe forthwith sent the cards to Arnold by his second in command, closed\r\nthe pantry door, and carefully smoothed out the crumpled sheet of paper\r\non which the two letters were written. This done, he trimmed his candle,\r\nand began with the letter in ink, which occupied the first three pages\r\nof the sheet of note-paper.\r\n\r\nIt ran thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWINDYGATES HOUSE, _August_ 12, 1868.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGEOFFREY DELAMAYN,--I have waited in the hope that you would ride over\r\nfrom your brother\xe2\x80\x99s place, and see me--and I have waited in vain. Your\r\nconduct to me is cruelty itself; I will bear it no longer. Consider! in\r\nyour own interests, consider--before you drive the miserable woman who\r\nhas trusted you to despair. You have promised me marriage by all that is\r\nsacred. I claim your promise. I insist on nothing less than to be\r\nwhat you vowed I should be--what I have waited all this weary time to\r\nbe--what I _am_, in the sight of Heaven, your wedded wife. Lady Lundie\r\ngives a lawn-party here on the 14th. I know you have been asked. I\r\nexpect you to accept her invitation. If I don\xe2\x80\x99t see you, I won\xe2\x80\x99t answer\r\nfor what may happen. My mind is made up to endure this suspense no\r\nlonger. Oh, Geoffrey, remember the past! Be faithful--be just--to your\r\nloving wife,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cANNE SILVESTER.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bishopriggs paused. His commentary on the correspondence, so far,\r\nwas simple enough. \xe2\x80\x9cHot words (in ink) from the leddy to the gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He ran his eye over the second letter, on the fourth page of the paper,\r\nand added, cynically, \xe2\x80\x9cA trifle caulder (in pencil) from the gentleman\r\nto the leddy! The way o\xe2\x80\x99 the warld, Sirs! From the time o\xe2\x80\x99 Adam\r\ndownwards, the way o\xe2\x80\x99 the warld!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe second letter ran thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR ANNE,--Just called to London to my father. They have telegraphed\r\nhim in a bad way. Stop where you are, and I will write you. Trust the\r\nbearer. Upon my soul, I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep my promise. Your loving husband that is\r\nto be,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGEOFFREY DELAMAYN.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWINDYGATES HOUSE, _Augt._ 14, 4 P. M.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a mortal hurry. Train starts at 4.30.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere it ended!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are the pairties in the parlor? Is ane o\xe2\x80\x99 them \xe2\x80\x98Silvester?\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other \xe2\x80\x98Delamayn?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d pondered Mr. Bishopriggs, slowly folding the letter\r\nup again in its original form. \xe2\x80\x9cHech, Sirs! what, being intairpreted,\r\nmay a\xe2\x80\x99 this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe mixed himself a second glass of toddy, as an aid to reflection, and\r\nsat sipping the liquor, and twisting and turning the letter in his gouty\r\nfingers. It was not easy to see his way to the true connection between\r\nthe lady and gentleman in the parlor and the two letters now in his own\r\npossession. They might be themselves the writers of the letters, or they\r\nmight be only friends of the writers. Who was to decide?\r\n\r\nIn the first case, the lady\xe2\x80\x99s object would appear to have been as good\r\nas gained; for the two had certainly asserted themselves to be man and\r\nwife, in his own presence, and in the presence of the landlady. In the\r\nsecond case, the correspondence so carelessly thrown aside might, for\r\nall a stranger knew to the contrary, prove to be of some importance\r\nin the future. Acting on this latter view, Mr. Bishopriggs--whose past\r\nexperience as \xe2\x80\x9ca bit clerk body,\xe2\x80\x9d in Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s chambers, had made\r\na man of business of him--produced his pen and ink, and indorsed the\r\nletter with a brief dated statement of the circumstances under which\r\nhe had found it. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do weel to keep the Doecument,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought to\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cWha knows but there\xe2\x80\x99ll be a reward offered for it ane o\xe2\x80\x99 these\r\ndays? Eh! eh! there may be the warth o\xe2\x80\x99 a fi\xe2\x80\x99 pun\xe2\x80\x99 note in this, to a\r\npuir lad like me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that comforting reflection, he drew out a battered tin cash-box\r\nfrom the inner recesses of the drawer, and locked up the stolen\r\ncorrespondence to bide its time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storm rose higher and higher as the evening advanced.\r\n\r\nIn the sitting-room, the state of affairs, perpetually changing, now\r\npresented itself under another new aspect.\r\n\r\nArnold had finished his dinner, and had sent it away. He had next drawn\r\na side-table up to the sofa on which Anne lay--had shuffled the pack of\r\ncards--and was now using all his powers of persuasion to induce her\r\nto try one game at _Ecarte_ with him, by way of diverting her\r\nattention from the tumult of the storm. In sheer weariness, she gave up\r\ncontesting the matter; and, raising herself languidly on the sofa, said\r\nshe would try to play. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing can make matters worse than they are,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she thought, despairingly, as Arnold dealt the cards for her. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing\r\ncan justify my inflicting my own wretchedness on this kind-hearted boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwo worse players never probably sat down to a game. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s attention\r\nperpetually wandered; and Anne\xe2\x80\x99s companion was, in all human\r\nprobability, the most incapable card-player in Europe.\r\n\r\nAnne turned up the trump--the nine of Diamonds. Arnold looked at\r\nhis hand--and \xe2\x80\x9cproposed.\xe2\x80\x9d Anne declined to change the cards. Arnold\r\nannounced, with undiminished good-humor, that he saw his way clearly,\r\nnow, to losing the game, and then played his first card--the Queen of\r\nTrumps!\r\n\r\nAnne took it with the King, and forgot to declare the King. She played\r\nthe ten of Trumps.\r\n\r\nArnold unexpectedly discovered the eight of Trumps in his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\na pity!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as he played it. \xe2\x80\x9cHullo! you haven\xe2\x80\x99t marked the King!\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll do it for you. That\xe2\x80\x99s two--no, three--to you. I said I should lose\r\nthe game. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be expected to do any thing (could I?) with such\r\na hand as mine. I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost every thing now I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost my trumps. You to\r\nplay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne looked at her hand. At the same moment the lightning flashed into\r\nthe room through the ill-closed shutters; the roar of the thunder burst\r\nover the house, and shook it to its foundation. The screaming of some\r\nhysterical female tourist, and the barking of a dog, rose shrill from\r\nthe upper floor of the inn. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s nerves could support it no longer.\r\nShe flung her cards on the table, and sprang to her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can play no more,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cForgive me--I am quite unequal to it.\r\nMy head burns! my heart stifles me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe began to pace the room again. Aggravated by the effect of the storm\r\non her nerves, her first vague distrust of the false position into which\r\nshe and Arnold had allowed themselves to drift had strengthened, by this\r\ntime, into a downright horror of their situation which was not to be\r\nendured. Nothing could justify such a risk as the risk they were now\r\nrunning! They had dined together like married people--and there they\r\nwere, at that moment, shut in together, and passing the evening like man\r\nand wife!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Brinkworth!\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cThink--for Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s sake, think--is\r\nthere no way out of this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold was quietly collecting the scattered cards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlanche, again?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with the most exasperating composure. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwonder how she feels, in this storm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn Anne\xe2\x80\x99s excited state, the reply almost maddened her. She turned from\r\nArnold, and hurried to the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, wildly. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t let this deception go on.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll do what I ought to have done before. Come what may of it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nthe landlady the truth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had opened the door, and was on the point of stepping into the\r\npassage--when she stopped, and started violently. Was it possible, in\r\nthat dreadful weather, that she had actually heard the sound of carriage\r\nwheels on the strip of paved road outside the inn?\r\n\r\nYes! others had heard the sound too. The hobbling figure of Mr.\r\nBishopriggs passed her in the passage, making for the house door.\r\nThe hard voice of the landlady rang through the inn, ejaculating\r\nastonishment in broad Scotch. Anne closed the sitting-room door again,\r\nand turned to Arnold--who had risen, in surprise, to his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTravelers!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cAt this time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in this weather!\xe2\x80\x9d added Arnold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Can_ it be Geoffrey?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked--going back to the old vain delusion\r\nthat he might yet feel for her, and return.\r\n\r\nArnold shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cNot Geoffrey. Whoever else it may be--not\r\nGeoffrey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Inchbare suddenly entered the room--with her cap-ribb ons flying,\r\nher eyes staring, and her bones looking harder than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, mistress!\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cWha do ye think has driven here to\r\nsee ye, from Windygates Hoose, and been owertaken in the storm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne was speechless. Arnold put the question: \xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWha is\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Inchbare. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s joost the bonny young\r\nleddy--Miss Blanche hersel\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn irrepressible cry of horror burst from Anne. The landlady set it down\r\nto the lightning, which flashed into the room again at the same moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, mistress! ye\xe2\x80\x99ll find Miss Blanche a bit baulder than to skirl at a\r\nflash o\xe2\x80\x99 lightning, that gait! Here she is, the bonny birdie!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\nMrs. Inchbare, deferentially backing out into the passage again.\r\n\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s voice reached them, calling for Anne.\r\n\r\nAnne caught Arnold by the hand and wrung it hard. \xe2\x80\x9cGo!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered.\r\nThe next instant she was at the mantle-piece, and had blown out both the\r\ncandles.\r\n\r\nAnother flash of lightning came through the darkness, and showed\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s figure standing at the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH.\r\n\r\nBLANCHE.\r\n\r\nMRS. INCHBARE was the first person who acted in the emergency. She\r\ncalled for lights; and sternly rebuked the house-maid, who brought them,\r\nfor not having closed the house door. \xe2\x80\x9cYe feckless ne\xe2\x80\x99er-do-weel!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nthe landlady; \xe2\x80\x9cthe wind\xe2\x80\x99s blawn the candles oot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman declared (with perfect truth) that the door had been closed.\r\nAn awkward dispute might have ensued if Blanche had not diverted Mrs.\r\nInchbare\xe2\x80\x99s attention to herself. The appearance of the lights disclosed\r\nher, wet through with her arms round Anne\xe2\x80\x99s neck. Mrs. Inchbare\r\ndigressed at once to the pressing question of changing the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclothes, and gave Anne the opportunity of looking round her, unobserved.\r\nArnold had made his escape before the candles had been brought in.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s attention was absorbed in her own dripping\r\nskirts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood gracious! I\xe2\x80\x99m absolutely distilling rain from every part of me.\r\nAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m making you, Anne, as wet as I am! Lend me some dry things. You\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t? Mrs. Inchbare, what does your experience suggest? Which had I\r\nbetter do? Go to bed while my clothes are being dried? or borrow from\r\nyour wardrobe--though you _are_ a head and shoulders taller than I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Inchbare instantly bustled out to fetch the choicest garments\r\nthat her wardrobe could produce. The moment the door had closed on her\r\nBlanche looked round the room in her turn.\r\n\r\nThe rights of affection having been already asserted, the claims of\r\ncuriosity naturally pressed for satisfaction next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody passed me in the dark,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cWas it your husband?\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m dying to be introduced to him. And, oh my dear! what _is_ your\r\nmarried name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne answered, coldly, \xe2\x80\x9cWait a little. I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak about it yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ill?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Blanche.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a little nervous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas any thing unpleasant happened between you and my uncle? You have\r\nseen him, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he give you my message?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe gave me your message.--Blanche! you promised him to stay at\r\nWindygates. Why, in the name of heaven, did you come here to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were half as fond of me as I am of you,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Blanche, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask that. I tried hard to keep my promise, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nit. It was all very well, while my uncle was laying down the law--with\r\nLady Lundie in a rage, and the dogs barking, and the doors banging, and\r\nall that. The excitement kept me up. But when my uncle had gone, and\r\nthe dreadful gray, quiet, rainy evening came, and it had all calmed down\r\nagain, there was no bearing it. The house--without you--was like a tomb.\r\nIf I had had Arnold with me I might have done very well. But I was\r\nall by myself. Think of that! Not a soul to speak to! There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nhorrible thing that could possibly happen to you that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t fancy was\r\ngoing to happen. I went into your empty room and looked at your things.\r\n_That_ settled it, my darling! I rushed down stairs--carried away,\r\npositively carried away, by an Impulse beyond human resistance. How\r\ncould I help it? I ask any reasonable person how could I help it? I ran\r\nto the stables and found Jacob. Impulse--all impulse! I said, \xe2\x80\x98Get the\r\npony-chaise--I must have a drive--I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if it rains--you come\r\nwith me.\xe2\x80\x99 All in a breath, and all impulse! Jacob behaved like an angel.\r\nHe said, \xe2\x80\x98All right, miss.\xe2\x80\x99 I am perfectly certain Jacob would die for\r\nme if I asked him. He is drinking hot grog at this moment, to prevent\r\nhim from catching cold, by my express orders. He had the pony-chaise out\r\nin two minutes; and off we went. Lady Lundie, my dear, prostrate in\r\nher own room--too much sal volatile. I hate her. The rain got worse. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mind it. Jacob didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind it. The pony didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind it. They\r\nhad both caught my impulse--especially the pony. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t come on to\r\nthunder till some time afterward; and then we were nearer Craig Fernie\r\nthan Windygates--to say nothing of your being at one place and not at\r\nthe other. The lightning was quite awful on the moor. If I had had one\r\nof the horses, he would have been frightened. The pony shook his darling\r\nlittle head, and dashed through it. He is to have beer. A mash with beer\r\nin it--by my express orders. When he has done we\xe2\x80\x99ll borrow a lantern,\r\nand go into the stable, and kiss him. In the mean time, my dear, here\r\nI am--wet through in a thunderstorm, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least\r\nmatter--and determined to satisfy my own mind about you, which matters a\r\ngreat deal, and must and shall be done before I rest to-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned Anne, by main force, as she spoke, toward the light of the\r\ncandles.\r\n\r\nHer tone changed the moment she looked at Anne\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou would never have kept the most interesting\r\nevent in your life a secret from _me_--you would never have written me\r\nsuch a cold formal letter as the letter you left in your room--if there\r\nhad not been something wrong. I said so at the time. I know it now! Why\r\nhas your husband forced you to leave Windygates at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice?\r\nWhy does he slip out of the room in the dark, as if he was afraid of\r\nbeing seen? Anne! Anne! what has come to you? Why do you receive me in\r\nthis way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that critical moment Mrs. Inchbare reappeared, with the choicest\r\nselection of wearing apparel which her wardrobe could furnish. Anne\r\nhailed the welcome interruption. She took the candles, and led the way\r\ninto the bedroom immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChange your wet clothes first,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can talk after that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bedroom door had hardly been closed a minute before there was a tap\r\nat it. Signing to Mrs. Inchbare not to interrupt the services she was\r\nrendering to Blanche, Anne passed quickly into the sitting-room, and\r\nclosed the door behind her. To her infinite relief, she only found\r\nherself face to face with the discreet Mr. Bishopriggs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nThe eye of Mr. Bishopriggs announced, by a wink, that his mission was of\r\na confidential nature. The hand of Mr. Bishopriggs wavered; the breath\r\nof Mr. Bishopriggs exhaled a spirituous fume. He slowly produced a slip\r\nof paper, with some lines of writing on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom ye ken who,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, jocosely. \xe2\x80\x9cA bit love-letter, I trow,\r\nfrom him that\xe2\x80\x99s dear to ye. Eh! he\xe2\x80\x99s an awfu\xe2\x80\x99 reprobate is him that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndear to ye. Miss, in the bedchamber there, will nae doot be the one he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njilted for _you?_ I see it all--ye can\xe2\x80\x99t blind Me--I ha\xe2\x80\x99 been a frail\r\nperson my ain self, in my time. Hech! he\xe2\x80\x99s safe and sound, is the\r\nreprobate. I ha\xe2\x80\x99 lookit after a\xe2\x80\x99 his little creature-comforts--I\xe2\x80\x99m joost\r\na fether to him, as well as a fether to you. Trust Bishopriggs--when\r\npuir human nature wants a bit pat on the back, trust Bishopriggs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile the sage was speaking these comfortable words, Anne was reading\r\nthe lines traced on the paper. They were signed by Arnold; and they ran\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in the smoking-room of the inn. It rests with you to say whether I\r\nmust stop there. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe Blanche would be jealous. If I knew how\r\nto explain my being at the inn without betraying the confidence which\r\nyou and Geoffrey have placed in me, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be away from her another\r\nmoment. It does grate on me so! At the same time, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make\r\nyour position harder than it is. Think of yourself first. I leave it\r\nin your hands. You have only to say, Wait, by the bearer--and I shall\r\nunderstand that I am to stay where I am till I hear from you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne looked up from the message.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk him to wait,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cand I will send word to him again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWi\xe2\x80\x99 mony loves and kisses,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Mr. Bishopriggs, as a necessary\r\nsupplement to the message. \xe2\x80\x9cEh! it comes as easy as A. B. C. to a man o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmy experience. Ye can ha\xe2\x80\x99 nae better gae-between than yer puir servant\r\nto command, Sawmuel Bishopriggs. I understand ye baith pairfeckly.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nlaid his forefinger along his flaming nose, and withdrew.\r\n\r\nWithout allowing herself to hesitate for an instant, Anne opened the\r\nbedroom door--with the resolution of relieving Arnold from the new\r\nsacrifice imposed on him by owning the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Blanche.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of her voice, Anne started back guiltily. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be with you\r\nin a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, and closed the door again between them.\r\n\r\nNo! it was not to be done. Something in Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s trivial question--or\r\nsomething, perhaps, in the sight of Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s face--roused the\r\nwarning instinct in Anne, which silenced her on the very brink of the\r\ndisclosure. At the last moment the iron chain of circumstances made\r\nitself felt, binding her without mercy to the hateful, the degrading\r\ndeceit. Could she own the truth, about Geoffrey and herself, to Blanche?\r\nand, without owning it, could she explain and justify Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s conduct\r\nin joining her privately at Craig Fernie? A shameful confession made to\r\nan innocent girl; a risk of fatally shaking Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s place in Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nestimation; a scandal at the inn, in the disgrace of which the others\r\nwould be involved with herself--this was the price at which she must\r\nspeak, if she followed her first impulse, and said, in so many words,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArnold is here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not to be thought of. Cost what it might in present\r\nwretchedness--end how it might, if the deception was discovered in the\r\nfuture--Blanche must be kept in ignorance of the truth, Arnold must be\r\nkept in hiding until she had gone.\r\n\r\nAnne opened the door for the second time, and went in.\r\n\r\nThe business of the toilet was standing still. Blanche was in\r\nconfidential communication with Mrs. Inchbare. At the moment when Anne\r\nentered the room she was eagerly questioning the landlady about her\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinvisible husband\xe2\x80\x9d--she was just saying, \xe2\x80\x9cDo tell me! what is\r\nhe like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe capacity for accurate observation is a capacity so uncommon, and is\r\nso seldom associated, even where it does exist, with the equally rare\r\ngift of accurately describing the thing or the person observed, that\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s dread of the consequences if Mrs. Inchbare was allowed time\r\nto comply with Blanches request, was, in all probability, a dread\r\nmisplaced. Right or wrong, however, the alarm that she felt hurried\r\nher into taking measures for dismissing the landlady on the spot. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t keep you from your occupations any longer,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Mrs.\r\nInchbare. \xe2\x80\x9cI will give Miss Lundie all the help she needs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBarred from advancing in one direction, Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity turned back,\r\nand tried in another. She boldly addressed herself to Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _must_ know something about him,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he shy before\r\nstrangers? I heard you whispering with him on the other side of the\r\ndoor. Are you jealous, Anne? Are you afraid I shall fascinate him in\r\nthis dress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche, in Mrs. Inchbare\xe2\x80\x99s best gown--an ancient and high-waisted\r\nsilk garment, of the hue called \xe2\x80\x9cbottle-green,\xe2\x80\x9d pinned up in front, and\r\ntrailing far behind her--with a short, orange-colored shawl over her\r\nshoulders, and a towel tied turban fashion round her head, to dry her\r\nwet hair, looked at once the strangest and the prettiest human anomaly\r\nthat ever was seen. \xe2\x80\x9cFor heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gayly, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nyour husband I am in Mrs. Inchbare\xe2\x80\x99s clothes! I want to appear suddenly,\r\nwithout a word to warn him of what a figure I am! I should have nothing\r\nleft to wish for in this world,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cif Arnold could only see\r\nme now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLooking in the glass, she noticed Anne\xe2\x80\x99s face reflected behind her, and\r\nstarted at the sight of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _is_ the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYour face frightens me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was useless to prolong the pain of the inevitable misunderstanding\r\nbetween them. The one course to take was to silence all further\r\ninquiries then and there. Strongly as she felt this, Anne\xe2\x80\x99s inbred\r\nloyalty to Blanche still shrank from deceiving her to her face. \xe2\x80\x9cI might\r\nwrite it,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say it, with Arnold Brinkworth in the\r\nsame house with her!\xe2\x80\x9d Write it? As she reconsidered the word, a sudden\r\nidea struck her. She opened the bedroom door, and led the way back into\r\nthe sitting-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone again!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Blanche, looking uneasily round the empty room.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne! there\xe2\x80\x99s something so strange in all this, that I neither can, nor\r\nwill, put up with your silence any longer. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just, it\xe2\x80\x99s not kind,\r\nto shut me out of your confidence, after we have lived together like\r\nsisters all our lives!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne sighed bitterly, and kissed her on the forehead. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall know\r\nall I can tell you--all I _dare_ tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gently. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreproach me. It hurts me more than you think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned away to the side table, and came back with a letter in her\r\nhand. \xe2\x80\x9cRead that,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and handed it to Blanche.\r\n\r\nBlanche saw her own name, on the address, in the handwriting of Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wrote to you, after Sir Patrick had left me,\xe2\x80\x9d Anne replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI meant\r\nyou to have received my letter to-morrow, in time to prevent any little\r\nimprudence into which your anxiety might hurry you. All that I _can_\r\nsay to you is said there. Spare me the distress of speaking. Read it,\r\nBlanche.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche still held the letter, unopened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA letter from you to me! when we are both together, and both alone\r\nin the same room! It\xe2\x80\x99s worse than formal, Anne! It\xe2\x80\x99s as if there was a\r\nquarrel between us. Why should it distress you to speak to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s eyes dropped to the ground. She pointed to the letter for the\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\nBlanche broke the seal.\r\n\r\nShe passed rapidly over the opening sentences, and devoted all her\r\nattention to the second paragraph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, my love, you will expect me to atone for the surprise and\r\ndistress that I have caused you, by explaining what my situation really\r\nis, and by telling you all my plans for the future. Dearest Blanche!\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think me untrue to the affection we bear toward each other--don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink there is any change in my heart toward you--believe only that I\r\nam a very unhappy woman, and that I am in a position which forces me,\r\nagainst my own will, to be silent about myself. Silent even to you, the\r\nsister of my love--the one person in the world who is dearest to me!\r\nA time may come when I shall be able to open my heart to you. Oh, what\r\ngood it will do me! what a relief it will be! For the present, I must be\r\nsilent. For the present, we must be parted. God knows what it costs me\r\nto write this. I think of the dear old days that are gone; I remember\r\nhow I promised your mother to be a sister to you, when her kind eyes\r\nlooked at me, for the last time--_your_ mother, who was an angel from\r\nheaven to _mine!_ All this comes back on me now, and breaks my heart.\r\nBut it must be! my own Blanche, for the present, it must be! I will\r\nwrite often--I will think of you, my darling, night and day, till a\r\nhappier future unites us again. God bless _you,_ my dear one! And God\r\nhelp _me!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche silently crossed the room to the sofa on which Anne was sitting,\r\nand stood there for a moment, looking at her. She sat down, and laid\r\nher head on Anne\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder. Sorrowfully and quietly, she put the letter\r\ninto her bosom--and took Anne\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and kissed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll my questions are answered, dear. I will wait your time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was simply, sweetly, generously said.\r\n\r\nAnne burst into tears.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe rain still fell, but the storm was dying away.\r\n\r\nBlanche left the sofa, and, going to the window, opened the shutters to\r\nlook out at the night. She suddenly came back to Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see lights,\xe2\x80\x9d she said--\xe2\x80\x9cthe lights of a carriage coming up out of\r\nthe darkness of the moor. They are sending after me, from Windygates. Go\r\ninto t he bedroom. It\xe2\x80\x99s just possible Lady Lundie may have come for me\r\nherself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ordinary relations of the two toward each other were completely\r\nreversed. Anne was like a child in Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s hands. She rose, and\r\nwithdrew.\r\n\r\nLeft alone, Blanche took the letter out of her bosom, and read it again,\r\nin the interval of waiting for the carriage.\r\n\r\nThe second reading confirmed her in a resolution which she had privately\r\ntaken, while she had been sitting by Anne on the sofa--a resolution\r\ndestined to lead to far more serious results in the future than any\r\nprevisions of hers could anticipate. Sir Patrick was the one person she\r\nknew on whose discretion and experience she could implicitly rely.\r\nShe determined, in Anne\xe2\x80\x99s own interests, to take her uncle into her\r\nconfidence, and to tell him all that had happened at the inn \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll first\r\nmake him forgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if he thinks\r\nas I do, when I tell him about Anne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe carriage drew up at the door; and Mrs. Inchbare showed in--not Lady\r\nLundie, but Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s maid.\r\n\r\nThe woman\xe2\x80\x99s account of what had happened at Windygates was simple\r\nenough. Lady Lundie had, as a matter of course, placed the right\r\ninterpretation on Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s abrupt departure in the pony-chaise, and\r\nhad ordered the carriage, with the firm determination of following her\r\nstep-daughter herself. But the agitations and anxieties of the day had\r\nproved too much for her. She had been seized by one of the attacks\r\nof giddiness to which she was always subject after excessive mental\r\nirritation; and, eager as she was (on more accounts than one) to go to\r\nthe inn herself, she had been compelled, in Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s absence, to\r\ncommit the pursuit of Blanche to her own maid, in whose age and good\r\nsense she could place every confidence. The woman seeing the state\r\nof the weather--had thoughtfully brought a box with her, containing a\r\nchange of wearing apparel. In offering it to Blanche, she added, with\r\nall due respect, that she had full powers from her mistress to go on,\r\nif necessary, to the shooting-cottage, and to place the matter in Sir\r\nPatrick\xe2\x80\x99s hands. This said, she left it to her young lady to decide\r\nfor herself, whether she would return to Windygates, under present\r\ncircumstances, or not.\r\n\r\nBlanche took the box from the woman\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and joined Anne in the\r\nbedroom, to dress herself for the drive home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going back to a good scolding,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut a scolding is no\r\nnovelty in my experience of Lady Lundie. I\xe2\x80\x99m not uneasy about that,\r\nAnne--I\xe2\x80\x99m uneasy about you. Can I be sure of one thing--do you stay here\r\nfor the present?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe worst that could happen at the inn _had_ happened. Nothing was to be\r\ngained now--and every thing might be lost--by leaving the place at which\r\nGeoffrey had promised to write to her. Anne answered that she proposed\r\nremaining at the inn for the present.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou promise to write to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there is any thing I can do for you--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing, my love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere may be. If you want to see me, we can meet at Windygates without\r\nbeing discovered. Come at luncheon-time--go around by the shrubbery--and\r\nstep in at the library window. You know as well as I do there is nobody\r\nin the library at that hour. Don\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible--you don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat may happen. I shall wait ten minutes every day on the chance of\r\nseeing you. That\xe2\x80\x99s settled--and it\xe2\x80\x99s settled that you write. Before I\r\ngo, darling, is there any thing else we can think of for the future?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt those words Anne suddenly shook off the depression that weighed on\r\nher. She caught Blanche in her arms, she held Blanche to her bosom with\r\na fierce energy. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you always be to me, in the future, what you are\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cOr is the time coming when you will hate\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d She prevented any reply by a kiss--and pushed Blanche toward the\r\ndoor. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have had a happy time together in the years that are gone,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said, with a farewell wave of her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cThank God for that! And\r\nnever mind the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe threw open the bedroom door, and called to the maid, in the\r\nsitting-room. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Lundie is waiting for you.\xe2\x80\x9d Blanche pressed her\r\nhand, and left her.\r\n\r\nAnne waited a while in the bedroom, listening to the sound made by the\r\ndeparture of the carriage from the inn door. Little by little, the tramp\r\nof the horses and the noise of the rolling wheels lessened and lessened.\r\nWhen the last faint sounds were lost in silence she stood for a moment\r\nthinking--then, rousing on a sudden, hurried into the sitting-room, and\r\nrang the bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall go mad,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cif I stay here alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven Mr. Bishopriggs felt the necessity of being silent when he stood\r\nface to face with her on answering the bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to speak to him. Send him here instantly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bishopriggs understood her, and withdrew.\r\n\r\nArnold came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas she gone?\xe2\x80\x9d were the first words he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has gone. She won\xe2\x80\x99t suspect you when you see her again. I have told\r\nher nothing. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me for my reasons!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no wish to ask you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe angry with me, if you like!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no wish to be angry with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe spoke and looked like an altered man. Quietly seating himself at the\r\ntable, he rested his head on his hand--and so remained silent. Anne\r\nwas taken completely by surprise. She drew near, and looked at him\r\ncuriously. Let a woman\xe2\x80\x99s mood be what it may, it is certain to feel the\r\ninfluence of any change for which she is unprepared in the manner of a\r\nman--when that man interests her. The cause of this is not to be found\r\nin the variableness of her humor. It is far more probably to be traced\r\nto the noble abnegation of Self, which is one of the grandest--and to\r\nthe credit of woman be it said--one of the commonest virtues of the sex.\r\nLittle by little, the sweet feminine charm of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s face came softly\r\nand sadly back. The inbred nobility of the woman\xe2\x80\x99s nature answered the\r\ncall which the man had unconsciously made on it. She touched Arnold on\r\nthe shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis has been hard on _you,_\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am to blame for it. Try\r\nand forgive me, Mr. Brinkworth. I am sincerely sorry. I wish with all my\r\nheart I could comfort you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Miss Silvester. It was not a very pleasant feeling, to be\r\nhiding from Blanche as if I was afraid of her--and it\xe2\x80\x99s set me thinking,\r\nI suppose, for the first time in my life. Never mind. It\xe2\x80\x99s all over now.\r\nCan I do any thing for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you propose doing to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I have proposed doing all along--my duty by Geoffrey. I have\r\npromised him to see you through your difficulties here, and to provide\r\nfor your safety till he comes back. I can only make sure of doing that\r\nby keeping up appearances, and staying in the sitting-room to-night.\r\nWhen we next meet it will be under pleasanter circumstances, I hope. I\r\nshall always be glad to think that I was of some service to you. In the\r\nmean time I shall be most likely away to-morrow morning before you are\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne held out her hand to take leave. Nothing could undo what had been\r\ndone. The time for warning and remonstrance had passed away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not befriended an ungrateful woman,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe day may\r\nyet come, Mr. Brinkworth, when I shall prove it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not, Miss Silvester. Good-by, and good luck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe withdrew into her own room. Arnold locked the sitting-room door, and\r\nstretched himself on the sofa for the night.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe morning was bright, the air was delicious after the storm.\r\n\r\nArnold had gone, as he had promised, before Anne was out of her room.\r\nIt was understood at the inn that important business had unexpectedly\r\ncalled him south. Mr. Bishopriggs had been presented with a handsome\r\ngratuity; and Mrs. Inchbare had been informed that the rooms were taken\r\nfor a week certain.\r\n\r\nIn every quarter but one the march of events had now, to all appearance,\r\nfallen back into a quiet course. Arnold was on his way to his estate;\r\nBlanche was safe at Windygates; Anne\xe2\x80\x99s residence at the inn was assured\r\nfor a week to come. The one present doubt was the doubt which hung over\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s movements. The one event still involved in darkness turned on\r\nthe question of life or death waiting for solution in London--otherwise,\r\nthe question of Lord Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s health. Taken by itself, the\r\nalternative, either way, was plain enough. If my lord lived--Geoffrey\r\nwould be free to come back, and marry her privately in Scotland. If\r\nmy lord died--Geoffrey would be free to send for her, and marry her\r\npublicly in London. But could Geoffrey be relied on?\r\n\r\nAnne went out on to the terrace-ground in front of the inn. The cool\r\nmorning breeze blew steadily. Towering white clouds sailed in grand\r\nprocession over the heavens, now obscuring, and now revealing the sun.\r\nYellow light and purple shadow chased each other over the broad brown\r\nsurface of the moor--even as hope and fear chased each other over Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind, brooding on what might come to her with the coming time.\r\n\r\nShe turned away, weary of questioning the impenetrable future, and went\r\nback to the inn.\r\n\r\nCrossing the hall she looked at the clock. It was past the hour when the\r\ntrain from Perthshire was due in London. Geoffrey and his brother were,\r\nat that moment, on their way to Lord Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD SCENE.--LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH.\r\n\r\nGEOFFREY AS A LETTER-WRITER.\r\n\r\nLORD HOLCHESTER\xe2\x80\x99S servants--with the butler at their head--were on the\r\nlook-out for Mr. Julius Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s arrival from Scotland. The appearance\r\nof the two brothers together took the whole domestic establishment by\r\nsurprise. Inquiries were addressed to the butler by Julius; Geoffrey\r\nstanding by, and taking no other than a listener\xe2\x80\x99s part in the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs my father alive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis lordship, I am rejoiced to say, has astonished the doctors, Sir.\r\nHe rallied last night in the most wonderful way. If things go on for the\r\nnext eight-and-forty hours as they are going now, my lord\xe2\x80\x99s recovery is\r\nconsidered certain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the illness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA paralytic stroke, Sir. When her ladyship telegraphed to you in\r\nScotland the doctors had given his lordship up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs my mother at home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer ladyship is at home to _you,_, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe butler laid a special emphasis on the personal pronoun. Julius\r\nturned to his brother. The change for the better in the state of\r\nLord Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s health made Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s position, at that moment, an\r\nembarrassing one. He had been positively forbidden to enter the house.\r\nHis one excuse for setting that prohibitory sentence at defiance rested\r\non the assumption that his father was actually dying. As matters\r\nnow stood, Lord Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s order remained in full force. The\r\nunder-servants in the hall (charged to obey that order as they valued\r\ntheir places) looked from \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x9d to the butler, The butler\r\nlooked from \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Julius.\xe2\x80\x9d Julius looked at his\r\nbrother. There was an awkward pause. The position of the second son was\r\nthe position of a wild beast in the house--a creature to be got rid of,\r\nwithout risk to yourself, if you only knew how.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey spoke, and solved the problem\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen the door, one of you fellows,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the footmen. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed his brother. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be a sad\r\ndisappointment to my mother to know that you have been here, and gone\r\naway again without seeing her. These are no ordinary circumstances,\r\nGeoffrey. Come up stairs with me--I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it on myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m blessed if I take it on _my_self!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cOpen the\r\ndoor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait here, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Julius, \xe2\x80\x9ctill I can send you down a\r\nmessage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend your message to Nagle\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel. I\xe2\x80\x99m at home at Nagle\xe2\x80\x99s--I\xe2\x80\x99m not at\r\nhome here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that point the discussion was interrupted by the appearance of a\r\nlittle terrier in the hall. Seeing strangers, the dog began to bark.\r\nPerfect tranquillity in the house had been absolutely insisted on by the\r\ndoctors; and the servants, all trying together to catch the animal and\r\nquiet him, simply aggravated the noise he was making. Geoffrey solved\r\nthis problem also in his own decisive way. He swung round as the dog was\r\npassing him, and kicked it with his heavy boot. The little creature\r\nfell on the spot, whining piteously. \xe2\x80\x9cMy lady\xe2\x80\x99s pet dog!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the\r\nbutler. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve broken its ribs, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve broken it of barking, you\r\nmean,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cRibs be hanged!\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to his brother.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat settles it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, jocosely. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d better defer the pleasure of\r\ncalling on dear mamma till the next opportunity. Ta-ta, Julius. You know\r\nwhere to find me. Come, and dine. We\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a steak at Nagle\xe2\x80\x99s that\r\nwill make a man of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went out. The tall footmen eyed his lordship\xe2\x80\x99s second son with\r\nunaffected respect. They had seen him, in public, at the annual festival\r\nof the Christian-Pugilistic-Association, with \xe2\x80\x9cthe gloves\xe2\x80\x9d on. He could\r\nhave beaten the biggest man in the hall within an inch of his life in\r\nthree minutes. The porter bowed as he threw open the door. The whole\r\ninterest and attention of the domestic establishment then present was\r\nconcentrated on Geoffrey. Julius went up stairs to his mother without\r\nattracting the slightest notice.\r\n\r\nThe month was August. The streets were empty. The vilest breeze that\r\nblows--a hot east wind in London--was the breeze abroad on that day.\r\nEven Geoffrey appeared to feel the influence of the weather as the cab\r\ncarried him from his father\xe2\x80\x99s door to the hotel. He took off his hat,\r\nand unbuttoned his waistcoat, and lit his everlasting pipe, and growled\r\nand grumbled between his teeth in the intervals of smoking. Was it only\r\nthe hot wind that wrung from him these demonstrations of discomfort? Or\r\nwas there some secret anxiety in his mind which assisted the depressing\r\ninfluences of the day? There was a secret anxiety in his mind. And the\r\nname of it was--Anne.\r\n\r\nAs things actually were at that moment, what course was he to take with\r\nthe unhappy woman who was waiting to hear from him at the Scotch inn?\r\n\r\nTo write? or not to write? That was the question with Geoffrey.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary difficulty, relating to addressing a letter to Anne at\r\nthe inn, had been already provided for. She had decided--if it proved\r\nnecessary to give her name, before Geoffrey joined her--to call herself\r\nMrs., instead of Miss, Silvester. A letter addressed to \xe2\x80\x9cMrs.\r\nSilvester\xe2\x80\x9d might be trusted to find its way to her without causing any\r\nembarrassment. The doubt was not here. The doubt lay, as usual, between\r\ntwo alternatives. Which course would it be wisest to take?--to inform\r\nAnne, by that day\xe2\x80\x99s post, that an interval of forty-eight hours must\r\nelapse before his father\xe2\x80\x99s recovery could be considered certain? Or\r\nto wait till the interval was over, and be guided by the result?\r\nConsidering the alternatives in the cab, he decided that the wise course\r\nwas to temporize with Anne, by reporting matters as they then stood.\r\n\r\nArrived at the hotel, he sat down to write the letter--doubted--and tore\r\nit up--doubted again--and began again--doubted once more--and tore\r\nup the second letter--rose to his feet--and owned to himself (in\r\nunprintable language) that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t for the life of him decide which\r\nwas safest--to write or to wait.\r\n\r\nIn this difficulty, his healthy physical instincts sent him to healthy\r\nphysical remedies for relief. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mind\xe2\x80\x99s in a muddle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try a bath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was an elaborate bath, proceeding through many rooms, and combining\r\nmany postures and applications. He steamed. He plunged. He simmered. He\r\nstood under a pipe, and received a cataract of cold water on his head.\r\nHe was laid on his back; he was laid on his stomach; he was respectfully\r\npounded and kneaded, from head to foot, by the knuckles of accomplished\r\npractitioners. He came out of it all, sleek, clear rosy, beautiful. He\r\nreturned to the hotel, and took up the writing materials--and behold\r\nthe intolerable indecision seized him again, declining to be washed out!\r\nThis time he laid it all to Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cThat infernal woman will be the ruin\r\nof me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey, taking up his hat. \xe2\x80\x9cI must try the dumb-bells.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pursuit of the new remedy for stimulating a sluggish brain took him\r\nto a public house, kept by the professional pedestrian who had the honor\r\nof training him when he contended at Athletic Sports.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA private room and the dumb-bells!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cThe heaviest you\r\nhave got.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stripped himself of his upper clothing, and set to work, with the\r\nheavy weights in each hand, waving them up and down, and backward and\r\nforward, in every attainable variety o f movement, till his magnificent\r\nmuscles seemed on the point of starting through his sleek skin. Little\r\nby little his animal spirits roused themselves. The strong\r\nexertion intoxicated the strong man. In sheer excitement he swore\r\ncheerfully--invoking thunder and lightning, explosion and blood, in\r\nreturn for the compliments profusely paid to him by the pedestrian and\r\nthe pedestrian\xe2\x80\x99s son. \xe2\x80\x9cPen, ink, and paper!\xe2\x80\x9d he roared, when he could\r\nuse the dumb-bells no longer. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mind\xe2\x80\x99s made up; I\xe2\x80\x99ll write, and have\r\ndone with it!\xe2\x80\x9d He sat down to his writing on the spot; actually finished\r\nthe letter; another minute would have dispatched it to the post--and, in\r\nthat minute, the maddening indecision took possession of him once more.\r\nHe opened the letter again, read it over again, and tore it up again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m out of my mind!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Geoffrey, fixing his big bewildered blue\r\neyes fiercely on the professor who trained him. \xe2\x80\x9cThunder and lightning!\r\nExplosion and blood! Send for Crouch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCrouch (known and respected wherever English manhood is known and\r\nrespected) was a retired prize-fighter. He appeared with the third\r\nand last remedy for clearing the mind known to the Honorable Geoffrey\r\nDelamayn--namely, two pair of boxing-gloves in a carpet-bag.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman and the prize-fighter put on the gloves, and faced each\r\nother in the classically correct posture of pugilistic defense. \xe2\x80\x9cNone of\r\nyour play, mind!\xe2\x80\x9d growled Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cFight, you beggar, as if you were\r\nin the Ring again with orders to win.\xe2\x80\x9d No man knew better than the great\r\nand terrible Crouch what real fighting meant, and what heavy blows\r\nmight be given even with such apparently harmless weapons as stuffed\r\nand padded gloves. He pretended, and only pretended, to comply with his\r\npatron\xe2\x80\x99s request. Geoffrey rewarded him for his polite forbearance by\r\nknocking him down. The great and terrible rose with unruffled composure.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell hit, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTry it with the other hand now.\xe2\x80\x9d Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntemper was not under similar control. Invoking everlasting destruction\r\non the frequently-blackened eyes of Crouch, he threatened instant\r\nwithdrawal of his patronage and support unless the polite pugilist\r\nhit, then and there, as hard as he could. The hero of a hundred fights\r\nquailed at the dreadful prospect. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a family to support,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n remarked Crouch. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you _will_ have it, Sir--there it is!\xe2\x80\x9d The fall of\r\nGeoffrey followed, and shook the house. He was on his legs again in an\r\ninstant--not satisfied even yet. \xe2\x80\x9cNone of your body-hitting!\xe2\x80\x9d he roared.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStick to my head. Thunder and lightning! explosion and blood! Knock it\r\nout of me! Stick to the head!\xe2\x80\x9d Obedient Crouch stuck to the head.\r\nThe two gave and took blows which would have stunned--possibly have\r\nkilled--any civilized member of the community. Now on one side of\r\nhis patron\xe2\x80\x99s iron skull, and now on the other, the hammering of the\r\nprize-fighter\xe2\x80\x99s gloves fell, thump upon thump, horrible to hear--until\r\neven Geoffrey himself had had enough of it. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Crouch,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, speaking civilly to the man for the first time. \xe2\x80\x9cThat will do. I\r\nfeel nice and clear again.\xe2\x80\x9d He shook his head two or three times, he was\r\nrubbed down like a horse by the professional runner; he drank a mighty\r\ndraught of malt liquor; he recovered his good-humor as if by magic.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWant the pen and ink, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired his pedestrian host. \xe2\x80\x9cNot I!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n answered Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cThe muddle\xe2\x80\x99s out of me now. Pen and ink be hanged!\r\nI shall look up some of our fellows, and go to the play.\xe2\x80\x9d He left the\r\npublic house in the happiest condition of mental calm. Inspired by the\r\nstimulant application of Crouch\xe2\x80\x99s gloves, his torpid cunning had been\r\nshaken up into excellent working order at last. Write to Anne? Who but a\r\nfool would write to such a woman as that until he was forced to it? Wait\r\nand see what the chances of the next eight-and-forty hours might bring\r\nforth, and then write to her, or desert her, as the event might decide.\r\nIt lay in a nut-shell, if you could only see it. Thanks to Crouch, he\r\ndid see it--and so away in a pleasant temper for a dinner with \xe2\x80\x9cour\r\nfellows\xe2\x80\x9d and an evening at the play!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIFTEENTH.\r\n\r\nGEOFFREY IN THE MARRIAGE MARKET.\r\n\r\nTHE interval of eight-and-forty hours passed--without the occurrence of\r\nany personal communication between the two brothers in that time.\r\n\r\nJulius, remaining at his father\xe2\x80\x99s house, sent brief written bulletins of\r\nLord Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s health to his brother at the hotel. The first bulletin\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cGoing on well. Doctors satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d The second was firmer in tone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing on excellently. Doctors very sanguine.\xe2\x80\x9d The third was the most\r\nexplicit of all. \xe2\x80\x9cI am to see my father in an hour from this. The\r\ndoctors answer for his recovery. Depend on my putting in a good word for\r\nyou, if I can; and wait to hear from me further at the hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s face darkened as he read the third bulletin. He called once\r\nmore for the hated writing materials. There could be no doubt now as to\r\nthe necessity of communicating with Anne. Lord Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s recovery had\r\nput him back again in the same critical position which he had occupied\r\nat Windygates. To keep Anne from committing some final act of despair,\r\nwhich would connect him with a public scandal, and ruin him so far as\r\nhis expectations from his father were concerned, was, once more, the\r\nonly safe policy that Geoffrey could pursue. His letter began and ended\r\nin twenty words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR ANNE,--Have only just heard that my father is turning the corner.\r\nStay where you are. Will write again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving dispatched this Spartan composition by the post, Geoffrey lit his\r\npipe, and waited the event of the interview between Lord Holchester and\r\nhis eldest son.\r\n\r\nJulius found his father alarmingly altered in personal appearance, but\r\nin full possession of his faculties nevertheless. Unable to return\r\nthe pressure of his son\xe2\x80\x99s hand--unable even to turn in the bed without\r\nhelp--the hard eye of the old lawyer was as keen, the hard mind of the\r\nold lawyer was as clear, as ever. His grand ambition was to see Julius\r\nin Parliament. Julius was offering himself for election in Perthshire,\r\nby his father\xe2\x80\x99s express desire, at that moment. Lord Holchester entered\r\neagerly into politics before his eldest son had been two minutes by his\r\nbedside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch obliged, Julius, for your congratulations. Men of my sort are not\r\neasily killed. (Look at Brougham and Lyndhurst!) You won\xe2\x80\x99t be called to\r\nthe Upper House yet. You will begin in the House of Commons--precisely\r\nas I wished. What are your prospects with the constituency? Tell me\r\nexactly how you stand, and where I can be of use to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, Sir, you are hardly recovered enough to enter on matters of\r\nbusiness yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite recovered enough. I want some present interest to occupy\r\nme. My thoughts are beginning to drift back to past times, and to things\r\nwhich are better forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d A sudden contraction crossed his livid\r\nface. He looked hard at his son, and entered abruptly on a new question.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJulius!\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9chave you ever heard of a young woman named Anne\r\nSilvester?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulius answered in the negative. He and his wife had exchanged cards\r\nwith Lady Lundie, and had excused themselves from accepting her\r\ninvitation to the lawn-party. With the exception of Blanche, they were\r\nboth quite ignorant of the persons who composed the family circle at\r\nWindygates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake a memorandum of the name,\xe2\x80\x9d Lord Holchester went on. \xe2\x80\x9cAnne\r\nSilvester. Her father and mother are dead. I knew her father in former\r\ntimes. Her mother was ill-used. It was a bad business. I have been\r\nthinking of it again, for the first time for many years. If the girl is\r\nalive and about the world she may remember our family name. Help\r\nher, Julius, if she ever wants help, and applies to you.\xe2\x80\x9d The painful\r\ncontraction passed across his face once more. Were his thoughts taking\r\nhim back to the memorable summer evening at the Hampstead villa? Did\r\nhe see the deserted woman swooning at his feet again? \xe2\x80\x9cAbout your\r\nelection?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mind is not used to be idle. Give\r\nit something to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulius stated his position as plainly and as briefly as he could.\r\nThe father found nothing to object to in the report--except the son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabsence from the field of action. He blamed Lady Holchester for\r\nsummoning Julius to London. He was annoyed at his son\xe2\x80\x99s being there, at\r\nthe bedside, when he ought to have been addressing the electors. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninconvenient, Julius,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, petulantly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see it yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving previously arranged with his mother to take the first opportunity\r\nthat offered of risking a reference to Geoffrey, Julius decided to \xe2\x80\x9csee\r\nit\xe2\x80\x9d in a light for which his father was not prepared. The opportunity\r\nwas before him. He took it on the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no inconvenience to me, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand it is no\r\ninconvenience to my brother either. Geoffrey was anxious about you too.\r\nGeoffrey has come to London with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLord Holchester looked at his eldest son with a grimly-satirical\r\nexpression of surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I not already told you,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my mind is not\r\naffected by my illness? Geoffrey anxious about me! Anxiety is one of the\r\ncivilized emotions. Man in his savage state is incapable of feeling it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother is not a savage, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis stomach is generally full, and his skin is covered with linen and\r\ncloth, instead of red ochre and oil. So far, certainly, your brother is\r\ncivilized. In all other respects your brother is a savage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what you mean, Sir. But there is something to be said for\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s way of life. He cultivates his courage and his strength.\r\nCourage and strength are fine qualities, surely, in their way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent qualities, as far as they go. If you want to know how far\r\nthat is, challenge Geoffrey to write a sentence of decent English, and\r\nsee if his courage doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fail him there. Give him his books to read\r\nfor his degree, and, strong as he is, he will be taken ill at the sight\r\nof them. You wish me to see your brother. Nothing will induce me to see\r\nhim, until his way of life (as you call it) is altered altogether. I\r\nhave but one hope of its ever being altered now. It is barely possible\r\nthat the influence of a sensible woman--possessed of such advantages\r\nof birth and fortune as may compel respect, even from a savage--might\r\nproduce its effect on Geoffrey. If he wishes to find his way back into\r\nthis house, let him find his way back into good society first, and bring\r\nme a daughter-in-law to plead his cause for him--whom his mother and I\r\ncan respect and receive. When that happens, I shall begin to have some\r\nbelief in Geoffrey. Until it does happen, don\xe2\x80\x99t introduce your brother\r\ninto any future conversations which you may have with Me. To return to\r\nyour election. I have some advice to give you before you go back. You\r\nwill do well to go back to-night. Lift me up on the pillow. I shall\r\nspeak more easily with my head high.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis son lifted him on the pillows, and once more entreated him to spare\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIt was useless. No remonstrances shook the iron resolution of the man\r\nwho had hewed his way through the rank and file of political humanity to\r\nhis own high place apart from the rest. Helpless, ghastly, snatched out\r\nof the very jaws of death, there he lay, steadily distilling the clear\r\ncommon-sense which had won him all his worldly rewards into the mind of\r\nhis son. Not a hint was missed, not a caution was forgotten, that could\r\nguide Julius safely through the miry political ways which he had trodden\r\nso safely and so dextrously himself. An hour more had passed before the\r\nimpenetrable old man closed his weary eyes, and consented to take his\r\nnourishment and compose himself to rest. His last words, rendered barely\r\narticulate by exhaustion, still sang the praises of party manoeuvres\r\nand political strife. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a grand career! I miss the House of Commons,\r\nJulius, as I miss nothing else!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeft free to pursue his own thoughts, and to guide his own movements,\r\nJulius went straight from Lord Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s bedside to Lady Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboudoir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas your father said any thing about Geoffrey?\xe2\x80\x9d was his mother\xe2\x80\x99s first\r\nquestion as soon as he entered the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father gives Geoffrey a last chance, if Geoffrey will only take it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s face clouded. \xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a look of\r\ndisappointment. \xe2\x80\x9cHis last chance is to read for his degree. Hopeless,\r\nmy dear. Quite hopeless! If it had only been something easier than that;\r\nsomething that rested with me--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does rest with you,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Julius. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear mother!--can you\r\nbelieve it?--Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s last chance is (in one word) Marriage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Julius! it\xe2\x80\x99s too good to be true!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulius repeated his father\xe2\x80\x99s own words. Lady Holchester looked twenty\r\nyears younger as she listened. When he had done she rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter who calls,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the servant, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not at home.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nturned to Julius, kissed him, and made a place for him on the sofa by\r\nher side. \xe2\x80\x9cGeoffrey shall take _that_ chance,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gayly--\xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\nanswer for it! I have three women in my mind, any one of whom would suit\r\nhim. Sit down, my dear, and let us consider carefully which of the three\r\nwill be most likely to attract Geoffrey, and to come up to your father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstandard of what his daughter-in-law ought to be. When we have decided,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t trust to writing. Go yourself and see Geoffrey at his hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMother and son entered on their consultation--and innocently sowed the\r\nseeds of a terrible harvest to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SIXTEENTH.\r\n\r\nGEOFFREY AS A PUBLIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\nTIME had advanced to after noon before the selection of Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfuture wife was accomplished, and before the instructions of Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother were complete enough to justify the opening of the matrimonial\r\nnegotiation at Nagle\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t leave him till you have got his promise,\xe2\x80\x9d were Lady Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlast words when her son started on his mission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Geoffrey doesn\xe2\x80\x99t jump at what I am going to offer him,\xe2\x80\x9d was the\r\nson\xe2\x80\x99s reply, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall agree with my father that the case is hopeless;\r\nand I shall end, like my father, in giving Geoffrey up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was strong language for Julius to use. It was not easy to rouse the\r\ndisciplined and equable temperament of Lord Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s eldest son.\r\nNo two men were ever more thoroughly unlike each other than these two\r\nbrothers. It is melancholy to acknowledge it of the blood relation of\r\na \xe2\x80\x9cstroke oar,\xe2\x80\x9d but it must be owned, in the interests of truth, that\r\nJulius cultivated his intelligence. This degenerate Briton could digest\r\nbooks--and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t digest beer. Could learn languages--and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlearn to row. Practiced the foreign vice of perfecting himself in the\r\nart of playing on a musical instrument and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t learn the English\r\nvirtue of knowing a good horse when he saw him. Got through life.\r\n(Heaven only knows how!) without either a biceps or a betting-book.\r\nHad openly acknowledged, in English society, that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think the\r\nbarking of a pack of hounds the finest music in the world. Could go to\r\nforeign parts, and see a mountain which nobody had ever got to the top\r\nof yet--and didn\xe2\x80\x99t instantly feel his honor as an Englishman involved in\r\ngetting to the top of it himself. Such people may, and do, exist among\r\nthe inferior races of the Continent. Let us thank Heaven, Sir, that\r\nEngland never has been, and never will be, the right place for them!\r\n\r\nArrived at Nagle\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel, and finding nobody to inquire of in the hall,\r\nJulius applied to the young lady who sat behind the window of \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nbar.\xe2\x80\x9d The young lady was reading something so deeply interesting in the\r\nevening newspaper that she never even heard him. Julius went into the\r\ncoffee-room.\r\n\r\nThe waiter, in his corner, was absorbed over a second newspaper. Three\r\ngentlemen, at three different tables, were absorbed in a third, fourth,\r\nand fifth newspaper. They all alike went on with their reading without\r\nnoticing the entrance of the stranger. Julius ventured on disturbing\r\nthe waiter by asking for Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn. At the sound of that\r\nillustrious name the waiter looked up with a start. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you Mr.\r\nDelamayn\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three gentlemen at the tables looked up with a start. The light of\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s celebrity fell, reflected, on Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s brother, and made a\r\npublic character of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll find Mr. Geoffrey, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the waiter, in a flurried, excited\r\nmanner, \xe2\x80\x9cat the Cock and Bottle, Putney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expected to find him here. I had an appointment with him at this\r\nhotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wait er opened his eyes on Julius with an expression of blank\r\nastonishment. \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you heard the news, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the waiter--and offered the newspaper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the three gentlemen--and offered the\r\nthree newspapers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Julius.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the waiter, in a hollow voice. \xe2\x80\x9cThe most dreadful\r\nthing that\xe2\x80\x99s happened in my time. It\xe2\x80\x99s all up, Sir, with the great\r\nFoot-Race at Fulham. Tinkler has gone stale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three gentlemen dropped solemnly back into their three chairs, and\r\nrepeated the dreadful intelligence, in chorus--\xe2\x80\x9cTinkler has gone stale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA man who stands face to face with a great national disaster, and who\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand it, is a man who will do wisely to hold his tongue\r\nand enlighten his mind without asking other people to help him. Julius\r\naccepted the waiter\xe2\x80\x99s newspaper, and sat down to make (if possible) two\r\ndiscoveries: First, as to whether \xe2\x80\x9cTinkler\xe2\x80\x9d did, or did not, mean a man.\r\nSecond, as to what particular form of human affliction you implied when\r\nyou described that man as \xe2\x80\x9cgone stale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no difficulty in finding the news. It was printed in the\r\nlargest type, and was followed by a personal statement of the facts,\r\ntaken one way--which was followed, in its turn, by another personal\r\nstatement of the facts, taken in another way. More particulars, and\r\nfurther personal statements, were promised in later editions. The royal\r\nsalute of British journalism thundered the announcement of Tinkler\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstaleness before a people prostrate on the national betting book.\r\n\r\nDivested of exaggeration, the facts were few enough and simple enough.\r\nA famous Athletic Association of the North had challenged a famous\r\nAthletic Association of the South. The usual \xe2\x80\x9cSports\xe2\x80\x9d were to take\r\nplace--such as running, jumping, \xe2\x80\x9cputting\xe2\x80\x9d the hammer, throwing\r\ncricket-balls, and the like--and the whole was to wind up with a\r\nFoot-Race of unexampled length and difficulty in the annals of human\r\nachievement between the two best men on either side. \xe2\x80\x9cTinkler\xe2\x80\x9d was the\r\nbest man on the side of the South. \xe2\x80\x9cTinkler\xe2\x80\x9d was backed in innumerable\r\nbetting-books to win. And Tinkler\xe2\x80\x99s lungs had suddenly given way under\r\nstress of training! A prospect of witnessing a prodigious achievement in\r\nfoot-racing, and (more important still) a prospect of winning and losing\r\nlarge sums of money, was suddenly withdrawn from the eyes of the British\r\npeople. The \xe2\x80\x9cSouth\xe2\x80\x9d could produce no second opponent worthy of the North\r\nout of its own associated resources. Surveying the athletic world in\r\ngeneral, but one man existed who might possibly replace \xe2\x80\x9cTinkler\xe2\x80\x9d--and\r\nit was doubtful, in the last degree, whether he would consent to come\r\nforward under the circumstances. The name of that man--Julius read it\r\nwith horror--was Geoffrey Delamayn.\r\n\r\nProfound silence reigned in the coffee-room. Julius laid down the\r\nnewspaper, and looked about him. The waiter was busy, in his corner,\r\nwith a pencil and a betting-book. The three gentlemen were busy, at the\r\nthree tables, with pencils and betting-books.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry and persuade him!\xe2\x80\x9d said the waiter, piteously, as Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother rose to leave the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry and persuade him!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed the three gentlemen, as Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother opened the door and went out.\r\n\r\nJulius called a cab and told the driver (busy with a pencil and a\r\nbetting-book) to go to the Cock and Bottle, Putney. The man brightened\r\ninto a new being at the prospect. No need to hurry him; he drove,\r\nunasked, at the top of his horse\xe2\x80\x99s speed.\r\n\r\nAs the cab drew near to its destination the signs of a great national\r\nexcitement appeared, and multiplied. The lips of a people pronounced,\r\nwith a grand unanimity, the name of \xe2\x80\x9cTinkler.\xe2\x80\x9d The heart of a people\r\nhung suspended (mostly in the public houses) on the chances for and\r\nagainst the possibility of replacing \xe2\x80\x9cTinkler\xe2\x80\x9d by another man. The\r\nscene in front of the inn was impressive in the highest degree. Even the\r\nLondon blackguard stood awed and quiet in the presence of the national\r\ncalamity. Even the irrepressible man with the apron, who always turns up\r\nto sell nuts and sweetmeats in a crowd, plied his trade in silence, and\r\nfound few indeed (to the credit of the nation be it spoken) who had\r\nthe heart to crack a nut at such a time as this. The police were on the\r\nspot, in large numbers, and in mute sympathy with the people, touching\r\nto see. Julius, on being stopped at the door, mentioned his name--and\r\nreceived an ovation. His brother! oh, heavens, his brother! The people\r\nclosed round him, the people shook hands with him, the people invoked\r\nblessings on his head. Julius was half suffocated, when the police\r\nrescued him, and landed him safe in the privileged haven on the inner\r\nside of the public house door. A deafening tumult broke out, as he\r\nentered, from the regions above stairs. A distant voice screamed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind yourselves!\xe2\x80\x9d A hatless shouting man tore down through the people\r\ncongregated on the stairs. \xe2\x80\x9cHooray! Hooray! He\xe2\x80\x99s promised to do it! He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nentered for the race!\xe2\x80\x9d Hundreds on hundreds of voices took up the cry.\r\nA roar of cheering burst from the people outside. Reporters for the\r\nnewspapers raced, in frantic procession, out of the inn, and rushed into\r\ncabs to put the news in print. The hand of the landlord, leading Julius\r\ncarefully up stairs by the arm, trembled with excitement. \xe2\x80\x9cHis brother,\r\ngentlemen! his brother!\xe2\x80\x9d At those magic words a lane was made through\r\nthe throng. At those magic words the closed door of the council-chamber\r\nflew open; and Julius found himself among the Athletes of his native\r\ncountry, in full parliament assembled. Is any description of them\r\nneeded? The description of Geoffrey applies to them all. The manhood\r\nand muscle of England resemble the wool and mutton of England, in this\r\nrespect, that there is about as much variety in a flock of athletes as\r\nin a flock of sheep. Julius looked about him, and saw the same man in\r\nthe same dress, with the same health, strength, tone, tastes, habits,\r\nconversation, and pursuits, repeated infinitely in every part of the\r\nroom. The din was deafening; the enthusiasm (to an uninitiated stranger)\r\nsomething at once hideous and terrifying to behold. Geoffrey had been\r\nlifted bodily on to the table, in his chair, so as to be visible to the\r\nwhole room. They sang round him, they danced round him, they cheered\r\nround him, they swore round him. He was hailed, in maudlin terms of\r\nendearment, by grateful giants with tears in their eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cDear old man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cGlorious, noble, splendid, beautiful fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d They hugged him. They\r\npatted him on the back. They wrung his hands. They prodded and punched\r\nhis muscles. They embraced the noble legs that were going to run\r\nthe unexampled race. At the opposite end of the room, where it was\r\nphysically impossible to get near the hero, the enthusiasm vented itself\r\nin feats of strength and acts of destruction. Hercules I. cleared a\r\nspace with his elbows, and laid down--and Hercules II. took him up in\r\nhis teeth. Hercules III. seized the poker from the fireplace, and broke\r\nit on his arm. Hercules IV. followed with the tongs, and shattered them\r\non his neck. The smashing of the furniture and the pulling down of the\r\nhouse seemed likely to succeed--when Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s eye lighted by accident\r\non Julius, and Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s voice, calling fiercely for his brother,\r\nhushed the wild assembly into sudden attention, and turned the fiery\r\nenthusiasm into a new course. Hooray for his brother! One, two,\r\nthree--and up with his brother on our shoulders! Four five, six--and\r\non with his brother, over our heads, to the other end of the room! See,\r\nboys--see! the hero has got him by the collar! the hero has lifted him\r\non the table! The hero heated red-hot with his own triumph, welcomes\r\nthe poor little snob cheerfully, with a volley of oaths. \xe2\x80\x9cThunder and\r\nlightning! Explosion and blood! What\xe2\x80\x99s up now, Julius? What\xe2\x80\x99s up now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulius recovered his breath, and arranged his coat. The quiet little\r\nman, who had just muscle enough to lift a dictionary from the shelf, and\r\njust training enough to play the fiddle, so far from being daunted by\r\nthe rough reception accorded to him, appeared to feel no other sentiment\r\nin relation to it than a sentiment of unmitigated contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not frightened, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cOur fellows are a\r\nroughish lot, but they mean well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Julius. \xe2\x80\x9cI am only wondering--when the\r\nSchools and Universities of England turn out such a set of ruffians as\r\nthese--how long the Schools and Universities of England will last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind what you are about, Julius! They\xe2\x80\x99ll cart you out of window if they\r\nhear you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will only confirm my opinion of them, Geoffrey, if they do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the assembly, seeing but not hearing the colloquy between the two\r\nbrothers, became uneasy on the subject of the coming race. A roar of\r\nvoices summoned Geoffrey to announce it, if there was any thing wrong.\r\nHaving pacified the meeting, Geoffrey turned again to his brother, and\r\nasked him, in no amiable mood, what the devil he wanted there?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to tell you something, before I go back to Scotland,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nJulius. \xe2\x80\x9cMy father is willing to give you a last chance. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake it, _my_ doors are closed against you as well as _his._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing is more remarkable, in its way, than the sound common-sense and\r\nadmirable self-restraint exhibited by the youth of the present time when\r\nconfronted by an emergency in which their own interests are concerned.\r\nInstead of resenting the tone which his brother had taken with him,\r\nGeoffrey instantly descended from the pedestal of glory on which\r\nhe stood, and placed himself without a struggle in the hands which\r\nvicariously held his destiny--otherwise, the hands which vicariously\r\nheld the purse. In five minutes more the meeting had been dismissed,\r\nwith all needful assurances relating to Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s share in the coming\r\nSports--and the two brothers were closeted together in one of the\r\nprivate rooms of the inn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut with it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t be long about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t be five minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Julius. \xe2\x80\x9cI go back to-night by the\r\nmail-train; and I have a great deal to do in the mean time. Here it is,\r\nin plain words: My father consents to see you again, if you choose to\r\nsettle in life--with his approval. And my mother has discovered where\r\nyou may find a wife. Birth, beauty, and money are all offered to you.\r\nTake them--and you recover your position as Lord Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s son.\r\nRefuse them--and you go to ruin your own way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s reception of the news from home was not of the most\r\nreassuring kind. Instead of answering he struck his fist furiously on\r\nthe table, and cursed with all his heart some absent woman unnamed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to do with any degrading connection which you may have\r\nformed,\xe2\x80\x9d Julius went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI have only to put the matter before you\r\nexactly as it stands, and to leave you to decide for yourself. The\r\nlady in question was formerly Miss Newenden--a descendant of one of the\r\noldest families in England. She is now Mrs. Glenarm--the young widow\r\n(and the childless widow) of the great iron-master of that name. Birth\r\nand fortune--she unites both. Her income is a clear ten thousand a\r\nyear. My father can and will, make it fifteen thousand, if you are lucky\r\nenough to persuade her to marry you. My mother answers for her personal\r\nqualities. And my wife has met her at our house in London. She is now,\r\nas I hear, staying with some friends in Scotland; and when I get back I\r\nwill take care that an invitation is sent to her to pay her next visit\r\nat my house. It remains, of course, to be seen whether you are fortunate\r\nenough to produce a favorable impression on her. In the mean time you\r\nwill be doing every thing that my father can ask of you, if you make the\r\nattempt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey impatiently dismissed that part of the question from all\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf she don\xe2\x80\x99t cotton to a man who\xe2\x80\x99s going to run in the Great Race at\r\nFulham,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are plenty as good as she is who will! That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot the difficulty. Bother _that!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you again, I have nothing to do with your difficulties,\xe2\x80\x9d Julius\r\nresumed. \xe2\x80\x9cTake the rest of the day to consider what I have said to you.\r\nIf you decide to accept the proposal, I shall expect you to prove you\r\nare in earnest by meeting me at the station to-night. We will travel\r\nback to Scotland together. You will complete your interrupted visit at\r\nLady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s (it is important, in my interests, that you should treat a\r\nperson of her position in the county with all due respect); and my wife\r\nwill make the necessary arrangements with Mrs. Glenarm, in anticipation\r\nof your return to our house. There is nothing more to be said, and no\r\nfurther necessity of my staying here. If you join me at the station\r\nto-night, your sister-in-law and I will do all we can to help you. If I\r\ntravel back to Scotland alone, don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself to follow--I have\r\ndone with you.\xe2\x80\x9d He shook hands with his brother, and went out.\r\n\r\nLeft alone, Geoffrey lit his pipe and sent for the landlord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet me a boat. I shall scull myself up the river for an hour or two.\r\nAnd put in some towels. I may take a swim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlord received the order--with a caution addressed to his\r\nillustrious guest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t show yourself in front of the house, Sir! If you let the people\r\nsee you, they\xe2\x80\x99re in such a state of excitement, the police won\xe2\x80\x99t answer\r\nfor keeping them in order.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go out by the back way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took a turn up and down the room. What were the difficulties to be\r\novercome before he could profit by the golden prospect which his brother\r\nhad offered to him? The Sports? No! The committee had promised to\r\ndefer the day, if he wished it--and a month\xe2\x80\x99s training, in his physical\r\ncondition, would be amply enough for him. Had he any personal\r\nobjection to trying his luck with Mrs. Glenarm? Not he! Any woman would\r\ndo--provided his father was satisfied, and the money was all right. The\r\nobstacle which was really in his way was the obstacle of the woman whom\r\nhe had ruined. Anne! The one insuperable difficulty was the difficulty\r\nof dealing with Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see how it looks,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cafter a pull up the\r\nriver!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe landlord and the police inspector smuggled him out by the back way\r\nunknown to the expectant populace in front The two men stood on the\r\nriver-bank admiring him, as he pulled away from them, with his long,\r\npowerful, easy, beautiful stroke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I call the pride and flower of England!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ninspector. \xe2\x80\x9cHas the betting on him begun?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix to four,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, \xe2\x80\x9cand no takers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJulius went early to the station that night. His mother was very\r\nanxious. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let Geoffrey find an excuse in your example,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif he is late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first person whom Julius saw on getting out of the carriage was\r\nGeoffrey--with his ticket taken, and his portmanteau in charge of the\r\nguard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH SCENE.--WINDYGATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SEVENTEENTH\r\n\r\nNEAR IT.\r\n\r\nTHE Library at Windygates was the largest and the handsomest room in\r\nthe house. The two grand divisions under which Literature is usually\r\narranged in these days occupied the customary places in it. On the\r\nshelves which ran round the walls were the books which humanity in\r\ngeneral respects--and does not read. On the tables distributed over\r\nthe floor were the books which humanity in general reads--and does not\r\nrespect. In the first class, the works of the wise ancients; and\r\nthe Histories, Biographies, and Essays of writers of more modern\r\ntimes--otherwise the Solid Literature, which is universally respected,\r\nand occasionally read. In the second class, the Novels of our own\r\nday--otherwise the Light Literature, which is universally read, and\r\noccasionally respected. At Windygates, as elsewhere, we believed History\r\nto be high literature, because it assumed to be true to Authorities\r\n(of which we knew little)--and Fiction to be low literature, because it\r\nattempted to be true to Nature (of which we knew less). At Windygates as\r\nelsewhere, we were always more or less satisfied with ourselves, if\r\nwe were publicly discovered consulting our History--and more or less\r\nashamed of ourselves, if we were publicly discovered devouring our\r\nFiction. An architectural peculiarity in the original arrangement of the\r\nlibrary favored the development of this common and curious form of human\r\nstupidity. While a row of luxurious arm-chairs, in the main thoroughfare\r\nof the room, invited the reader of solid literature to reveal himself\r\nin the act of cultivating a virtue, a row of snug little curtained\r\nrecesses, opening at intervals out of one of the walls, enabled the\r\nreader of light literature to conceal himself in the act of indulging\r\na vice. For the rest, all the minor accessories of this spacious and\r\ntranquil place were as plentiful and as well chosen as the heart could\r\ndesire. And solid literature and light literature, and great writers and\r\nsmall, were all bounteously illuminated alike by a fine broad flow of\r\nthe light of heaven, pouring into the room through windows that opened\r\nto the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the fourth day from the day of Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s garden-party, and\r\nit wanted an hour or more of the time at which the luncheon-bell usually\r\nrang.\r\n\r\nThe guests at Windygates were most of them in the garden, enjoying the\r\nmorning sunshine, after a prevalent mist and rain for some days past.\r\nTwo gentlemen (exceptions to the general rule) were alone in the\r\nlibrary. They were the two last gentlemen in the would who could\r\npossibly be supposed to have any legitimate motive for meeting each\r\nother in a place of literary seclusion. One was Arnold Brinkworth, and\r\nthe other was Geoffrey Delamayn.\r\n\r\nThey had arrived together at Windygates that morning. Geoffrey had\r\ntraveled from London with his brother by the train of the previous\r\nnight. Arnold, delayed in getting away at his own time, from his own\r\nproperty, by ceremonies incidental to his position which were not to be\r\nabridged without giving offense to many worthy people--had caught the\r\npassing train early that morning at the station nearest to him, and had\r\nreturned to Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s, as he had left Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s, in company with\r\nhis friend.\r\n\r\nAfter a short preliminary interview with Blanche, Arnold had rejoined\r\nGeoffrey in the safe retirement of the library, to say what was still\r\nleft to be said between them on the subject of Anne. Having completed\r\nhis report of events at Craig Fernie, he was now naturally waiting to\r\nhear what Geoffrey had to say on his side. To Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment,\r\nGeoffrey coolly turned away to leave the library without uttering a\r\nword.\r\n\r\nArnold stopped him without ceremony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot quite so fast, Geoffrey,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have an interest in Miss\r\nSilvester\xe2\x80\x99s welfare as well as in yours. Now you are back again in\r\nScotland, what are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Geoffrey had told the truth, he must have stated his position much as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nHe had necessarily decided on deserting Anne when he had decided on\r\njoining his brother on the journey back. But he had advanced no farther\r\nthan this. How he was to abandon the woman who had trusted him, without\r\nseeing his own dastardly conduct dragged into the light of day, was more\r\nthan he yet knew. A vague idea of at once pacifying and deluding Anne,\r\nby a marriage which should be no marriage at all, had crossed his mind\r\non the journey. He had asked himself whether a trap of that sort might\r\nnot be easily set in a country notorious for the looseness of its\r\nmarriage laws--if a man only knew how? And he had thought it likely that\r\nhis well-informed brother, who lived in Scotland, might be tricked\r\ninto innocently telling him what he wanted to know. He had turned the\r\nconversation to the subject of Scotch marriages in general by way of\r\ntrying the experiment. Julius had not studied the question; Julius knew\r\nnothing about it; and there the experiment had come to an end. As the\r\nnecessary result of the check thus encountered, he was now in Scotland\r\nwith absolutely nothing to trust to as a means of effecting his release\r\nbut the chapter of accidents, aided by his own resolution to marry Mrs.\r\nGlenarm. Such was his position, and such should have been the substance\r\nof his reply when he was confronted by Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s question, and plainly\r\nasked what he meant to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe right thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, unblushingly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd no mistake about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to hear you see your way so plainly,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nyour place, I should have been all abroad. I was wondering, only the\r\nother day, whether you would end, as I should have ended, in consulting\r\nSir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey eyed him sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsult Sir Patrick?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy would you have done that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have known how to set about marrying her,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nArnold. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd--being in Scotland--I should have applied to Sir Patrick\r\n(without mentioning names, of course), because he would be sure to know\r\nall about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I don\xe2\x80\x99t see my way quite so plainly as you think,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGeoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you advise me--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo consult Sir Patrick? Certainly! He has passed his life in the\r\npractice of the Scotch law. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen take my advice--and consult him. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t mention names. You\r\ncan say it\xe2\x80\x99s the case of a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe idea was a new one and a good one. Geoffrey looked longingly toward\r\nthe door. Eager to make Sir Patrick his innocent accomplice on the\r\nspot, he made a second attempt to leave the library; and made it for the\r\nsecond time in vain. Arnold had more unwelcome inquiries to make, and\r\nmore advice to give unasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow have you arranged about meeting Miss Silvester?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t go to the hotel in the character of her husband. I have prevented\r\nthat. Where else are you to meet her? She is all alone; she must be\r\nweary of waiting, poor thing. Can you manage matters so as to see her\r\nto-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter staring hard at Arnold while he was speaking, Geoffrey burst out\r\nlaughing when he had done. A disinterested anxiety for the welfare of\r\nanother person was one of those refinements of feeling which a muscular\r\neducation had not fitted him to understand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, old boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he burst out, \xe2\x80\x9cyou seem to take an extraordinary\r\ninterest in Miss Silvester! You haven\xe2\x80\x99t fallen in love with her\r\nyourself--have you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! come!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold, seriously. \xe2\x80\x9cNeither she nor I deserve to\r\nbe sneered at, in that way. I have made a sacrifice to your interests,\r\nGeoffrey--and so has she.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s face became serious again. His secret was in Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s hands;\r\nand his estimate of Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s character was founded, unconsciously,\r\non his experience of himself. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, by way of timely\r\napology and concession. \xe2\x80\x9cI was only joking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs much joking as you please, when you have married her,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nArnold. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems serious enough, to my mind, till then.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nstopped--considered--and laid his hand very earnestly on Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind!\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not to breathe a word to any living soul,\r\nof my having been near the inn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve promised to hold my tongue, once already. What do you want more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am anxious, Geoffrey. I was at Craig Fernie, remember, when Blanche\r\ncame there! She has been telling me all that happened, poor darling, in\r\nthe firm persuasion that I was miles off at the time. I swear I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlook her in the face! What would she think of me, if she knew the truth?\r\nPray be careful! pray be careful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s patience began to fail him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had all this out,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9con the way here from the station.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of going over the ground again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold, good-humoredly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is--I\xe2\x80\x99m out\r\nof sorts, this morning. My mind misgives me--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Geoffrey, in high contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s flesh--that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe matter with _you._ You\xe2\x80\x99re nigh on a stone over your right weight.\r\nMind he hanged! A man in healthy training don\xe2\x80\x99t know that he has got\r\na mind. Take a turn with the dumb-bells, and a run up hill with a\r\ngreat-coat on. Sweat it off, Arnold! Sweat it off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that excellent advice, he turned to leave the room for the third\r\ntime. Fate appeared to have determined to keep him imprisoned in the\r\nlibrary, that morning. On this occasion, it was a servant who got in the\r\nway--a servant, with a letter and a message. \xe2\x80\x9cThe man waits for answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey looked at the letter. It was in his brother\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting.\r\nHe had left Julius at the junction about three hours since. What could\r\nJulius possibly have to say to him now?\r\n\r\nHe opened the letter. Julius had to announce that Fortune was favoring\r\nthem already. He had heard news of Mrs. Glenarm, as soon as he reached\r\nhome. She had called on his wife, during his absence in London--she\r\nhad been inv ited to the house--and she had promised to accept the\r\ninvitation early in the week. \xe2\x80\x9cEarly in the week,\xe2\x80\x9d Julius wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cmay\r\nmean to-morrow. Make your apologies to Lady Lundie; and take care not\r\nto offend her. Say that family reasons, which you hope soon to have\r\nthe pleasure of confiding to her, oblige you to appeal once more to her\r\nindulgence--and come to-morrow, and help us to receive Mrs. Glenarm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven Geoffrey was startled, when he found himself met by a sudden\r\nnecessity for acting on his own decision. Anne knew where his brother\r\nlived. Suppose Anne (not knowing where else to find him) appeared at\r\nhis brother\xe2\x80\x99s house, and claimed him in the presence of Mrs. Glenarm? He\r\ngave orders to have the messenger kept waiting, and said he would send\r\nback a written reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Craig Fernie?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arnold, pointing to the letter in his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey looked up with a frown. He had just opened his lips to answer\r\nthat ill-timed reference to Anne, in no very friendly terms, when a\r\nvoice, calling to Arnold from the lawn outside, announced the appearance\r\nof a third person in the library, and warned the two gentlemen that\r\ntheir private interview was at an end.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE EIGHTEENTH.\r\n\r\nNEARER STILL.\r\n\r\nBLANCHE stepped lightly into the room, through one of the open French\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Arnold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. I was just going to look for you in the garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe garden is insufferable, this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d Saying those words, she\r\nfanned herself with her handkerchief, and noticed Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s presence\r\nin the room with a look of very thinly-concealed annoyance at the\r\ndiscovery. \xe2\x80\x9cWait till I am married!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Delamayn will be\r\ncleverer than I take him to be, if he gets much of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s company\r\n_then!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA trifle too hot--eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey, seeing her eyes fixed on him, and\r\nsupposing that he was expected to say something.\r\n\r\nHaving performed that duty he walked away without waiting for a reply;\r\nand seated himself with his letter, at one of the writing-tables in the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick is quite right about the young men of the present day,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Blanche, turning to Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is this one asks me a question,\r\nand doesn\xe2\x80\x99t wait for an answer. There are three more of them, out in\r\nthe garden, who have been talking of nothing, for the last hour, but the\r\npedigrees of horses and the muscles of men. When we are married, Arnold,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t present any of your male friends to me, unless they have turned\r\nfifty. What shall we do till luncheon-time? It\xe2\x80\x99s cool and quiet in here\r\namong the books. I want a mild excitement--and I have got absolutely\r\nnothing to do. Suppose you read me some poetry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile _he_ is here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arnold, pointing to the personified\r\nantithesis of poetry--otherwise to Geoffrey, seated with his back to\r\nthem at the farther end of the library.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s only an animal in the room. We needn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind _him!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re as bitter, this morning, as Sir\r\nPatrick himself. What will you say to Me when we are married if you talk\r\nin that way of my friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche stole her hand into Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s hand and gave it a little\r\nsignificant squeeze. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall always be nice to _you,_\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwhispered--with a look that contained a host of pretty promises in\r\nitself. Arnold returned the look (Geoffrey was unquestionably in the\r\nway!). Their eyes met tenderly (why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t the great awkward brute\r\nwrite his letters somewhere else?). With a faint little sigh, Blanche\r\ndropped resignedly into one of the comfortable arm-chairs--and asked\r\nonce more for \xe2\x80\x9csome poetry,\xe2\x80\x9d in a voice that faltered softly, and with a\r\ncolor that was brighter than usual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose poetry am I to read?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Arnold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny body\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is another of my impulses. I am dying\r\nfor some poetry. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whose poetry. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold went straight to the nearest book-shelf, and took down the first\r\nvolume that his hand lighted on--a solid quarto, bound in sober brown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you found?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold opened the volume, and conscientiously read the title exactly as\r\nit stood:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParadise Lost. A Poem. By John Milton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never read Milton,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother instance of sympathy between us. No educated person ought to be\r\nignorant of Milton. Let us be educated persons. Please begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the beginning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course! Stop! You musn\xe2\x80\x99t sit all that way off--you must sit where\r\nI can look at you. My attention wanders if I don\xe2\x80\x99t look at people while\r\nthey read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold took a stool at Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s feet, and opened the \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Book\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\nParadise Lost. His \xe2\x80\x9csystem\xe2\x80\x9d as a reader of blank verse was simplicity\r\nitself. In poetry we are some of us (as many living poets can testify)\r\nall for sound; and some of us (as few living poets can testify) all for\r\nsense. Arnold was for sound. He ended every line inexorably with a\r\nfull stop; and he got on to his full stop as fast as the inevitable\r\nimpediment of the words would let him. He began:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cOf Man\xe2\x80\x99s first disobedience and the fruit.\r\n     Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste.\r\n     Brought death into the world and all our woe.\r\n     With loss of Eden till one greater Man.\r\n     Restore us and regain the blissful seat.\r\n     Sing heavenly Muse--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a shame it seems to have had Milton all\r\nthis time in the library and never to have read him yet! We will have\r\nMornings with Milton, Arnold. He seems long; but we are both young, and\r\nwe _may_ live to get to the end of him. Do you know dear, now I look\r\nat you again, you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have come back to Windygates in good\r\nspirits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t I? I can\xe2\x80\x99t account for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can. It\xe2\x80\x99s sympathy with Me. I am out of spirits too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. After what I saw at Craig Fernie, I grow more and more uneasy\r\nabout Anne. You will understand that, I am sure, after what I told you\r\nthis morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold looked back, in a violent hurry, from Blanche to Milton. That\r\nrenewed reference to events at Craig Fernie was a renewed reproach to\r\nhim for his conduct at the inn. He attempted to silence her by pointing\r\nto Geoffrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there is somebody in the room\r\nbesides ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche shrugged her shoulders contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does _he_ matter?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does _he_ know or care about\r\nAnne?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was only one other chance of diverting her from the delicate\r\nsubject. Arnold went on reading headlong, two lines in advance of the\r\nplace at which he had left off, with more sound and less sense than\r\never:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cIn the beginning how the heavens and earth.\r\n     Rose out of Chaos or if Sion hill--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt \xe2\x80\x9cSion hill,\xe2\x80\x9d Blanche interrupted him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo wait a little, Arnold. I can\xe2\x80\x99t have Milton crammed down my throat\r\nin that way. Besides I had something to say. Did I tell you that I\r\nconsulted my uncle about Anne? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I did. I caught him alone\r\nin this very room. I told him all I have told you. I showed him Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter. And I said, \xe2\x80\x98What do you think?\xe2\x80\x99 He took a little time (and a\r\ngreat deal of snuff) before he would say what he thought. When he did\r\nspeak, he told me I might quite possibly be right in suspecting Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhusband to be a very abominable person. His keeping himself out of my\r\nway was (just as I thought) a suspicious circumstance, to begin with.\r\nAnd then there was the sudden extinguishing of the candles, when I first\r\nwent in. I thought (and Mrs. Inchbare thought) it was done by the wind.\r\nSir Patrick suspects it was done by the horrid man himself, to prevent\r\nme from seeing him when I entered the room. I am firmly persuaded Sir\r\nPatrick is right. What do _you_ think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we had better go on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold, with his head down over his\r\nbook. \xe2\x80\x9cWe seem to be forgetting Milton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you do worry about Milton! That last bit wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as interesting as\r\nthe other. Is there any love in Paradise Lost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps we may find some if we go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then. Go on. And be quick about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold was _so_ quick about it that he lost his place. Instead of going\r\non he went back. He read once more:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cIn the beginning how the heavens and earth.\r\n     Rose out of  Chaos or if Sion hill--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou read that before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you did. When you said \xe2\x80\x98Sion hill\xe2\x80\x99 I recollect I thought of\r\nthe Methodists directly. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought of the Methodists, if\r\nyou hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said \xe2\x80\x98Sion hill.\xe2\x80\x99 It stands to reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try the next page,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t have read that\r\nbefore--for I haven\xe2\x80\x99t turned over yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche threw herself back in her chair, and flung her handkerchief\r\nresignedly over her face. \xe2\x80\x9cThe flies,\xe2\x80\x9d she explained. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to\r\nsleep. Try the next page. Oh, dear me, try the next page!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold proceeded:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cSay first for heaven hides nothing from thy view.\r\n     Nor the deep tract of hell say first what cause.\r\n     Moved our grand parents in that happy state--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche suddenly threw the handkerchief off again, and sat bolt upright\r\nin her chair. \xe2\x80\x9cShut it up,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t bear any more. Leave\r\noff, Arnold--leave off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s, the matter now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98That happy state,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does \xe2\x80\x98that happy state\xe2\x80\x99 mean?\r\nMarriage, of course! And marriage reminds me of Anne. I won\xe2\x80\x99t have any\r\nmore. Paradise Lost is painful. Shut it up. Well, my next question to\r\nSir Patrick was, of course, to know what he thought Anne\xe2\x80\x99s husband had\r\ndone. The wretch had behaved infamously to her in some way. In what way?\r\nWas it any thing to do with her marriage? My uncle considered again. He\r\nthought it quite possible. Private marriages were dangerous things (he\r\nsaid)--especially in Scotland. He asked me if they had been married in\r\nScotland. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell him--I only said, \xe2\x80\x98Suppose they were? What\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s barely possible, in that case,\xe2\x80\x99 says Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x98that\r\nMiss Silvester may be feeling uneasy about her marriage. She may even\r\nhave reason--or may think she has reason--to doubt whether it is a\r\nmarriage at all.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold started, and looked round at Geoffrey still sitting at the\r\nwriting-table with his back turned on them. Utterly as Blanche and Sir\r\nPatrick were mistaken in their estimate of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s position at Craig\r\nFernie, they had drifted, nevertheless, into discussing the very\r\nquestion in which Geoffrey and Miss Silvester were interested--the\r\nquestion of marriage in Scotland. It was impossible in Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence to tell Geoffrey that he might do well to listen to Sir\r\nPatrick\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, even at second-hand. Perhaps the words had found\r\ntheir way to him? perhaps he was listening already, of his own accord?\r\n\r\n(He _was_ listening. Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s last words had found their way to him,\r\nwhile he was pondering over his half-finished letter to his brother. He\r\nwaited to hear more--without moving, and with the pen suspended in his\r\nhand.)\r\n\r\nBlanche proceeded, absently winding her fingers in and out of Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhair as he sat at her feet:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt flashed on me instantly that Sir Patrick had discovered the\r\ntruth. Of course I told him so. He laughed, and said I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t jump at\r\nconclusions We were guessing quite in the dark; and all the distressing\r\nthings I had noticed at the inn might admit of some totally different\r\nexplanation. He would have gone on splitting straws in that provoking\r\nway the whole morning if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped him. I was strictly logical.\r\nI said _I_ had seen Anne, and _he_ hadn\xe2\x80\x99t--and that made all the\r\ndifference. I said, \xe2\x80\x98Every thing that puzzled and frightened me in the\r\npoor darling is accounted for now. The law must, and shall, reach\r\nthat man, uncle--and I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay for it!\xe2\x80\x99 I was so much in earnest that\r\nI believe I cried a little. What do you think the dear old man did? He\r\ntook me on his knee and gave me a kiss; and he said, in the nicest way,\r\nthat he would adopt my view, for the present, if I would promise not to\r\ncry any more; and--wait! the cream of it is to come!--that he would put\r\nthe view in quite a new light to me as soon as I was composed again. You\r\nmay imagine how soon I dried my eyes, and what a picture of composure I\r\npresented in the course of half a minute. \xe2\x80\x98Let us take it for granted,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsays Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x98that this man unknown has really tried to deceive\r\nMiss Silvester, as you and I suppose. I can tell you one thing: it\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\nlikely as not that, in trying to overreach _her,_ he may (without in the\r\nleast suspecting it) have ended in overreaching himself.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(Geoffrey held his breath. The pen dropped unheeded from his fingers. It\r\nwas coming. The light that his brother couldn\xe2\x80\x99t throw on the subject was\r\ndawning on it at last!)\r\n\r\nBlanche resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was so interested, and it made such a tremendous impression on me,\r\nthat I haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten a word. \xe2\x80\x98I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t make that poor little head\r\nof yours ache with Scotch law,\xe2\x80\x99 my uncle said; \xe2\x80\x98I must put it plainly.\r\nThere are marriages allowed in Scotland, Blanche, which are called\r\nIrregular Marriages--and very abominable things they are. But they have\r\nthis accidental merit in the present case. It is extremely difficult for\r\na man to pretend to marry in Scotland, and not really to do it. And it\r\nis, on the other hand, extremely easy for a man to drift into marrying\r\nin Scotland without feeling the slightest suspicion of having done it\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x99 That was exactly what he said, Arnold. When _we_ are married,\r\nit sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be in Scotland!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s ruddy color paled. If this was true he might be caught\r\nhimself in the trap which he had schemed to set for Anne! Blanche went\r\non with her narrative. He waited and listened.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy uncle asked me if I understood him so far. It was as plain as the\r\nsun at noonday, of course I understood him! \xe2\x80\x98Very well, then--now for\r\nthe application!\xe2\x80\x99 says Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x98Once more supposing our guess to be\r\nthe right one, Miss Silvester may be making herself very unhappy without\r\nany real cause. If this invisible man at Craig Fernie has actually\r\nmeddled, I won\xe2\x80\x99t say with marrying her, but only with pretending to make\r\nher his wife, and if he has attempted it in Scotland, the chances are\r\nnine to one (though _he_ may not believe it, and though _she_ may not\r\nbelieve it) that he has really married her, after all.\xe2\x80\x99 My uncle\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nwords again! Quite needless to say that, half an hour after they were\r\nout of his lips, I had sent them to Craig Fernie in a letter to Anne!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s stolidly-staring eyes suddenly brightened. A light of\r\nthe devil\xe2\x80\x99s own striking illuminated him. An idea of the devil\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nbringing entered his mind. He looked stealthily round at the man whose\r\nlife he had saved--at the man who had devotedly served him in return. A\r\nhideous cunning leered at his mouth and peeped out of his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cArnold\r\nBrinkworth pretended to be married to her at the inn. By the lord Harry!\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s a way out of it that never struck me before!\xe2\x80\x9d With that thought\r\nin his heart he turned back again to his half-finished letter to Julius.\r\nFor once in his life he was strongly, fiercely agitated. For once in\r\nhis life he was daunted--and that by his Own Thought! He had written to\r\nJulius under a strong sense of the necessity of gaining time to delude\r\nAnne into leaving Scotland before he ventured on paying his addresses to\r\nMrs. Glenarm. His letter contained a string of clumsy excuses, intended\r\nto delay his return to his brother\xe2\x80\x99s house. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, as\r\nhe read it again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever else may do--_this_ won\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d He looked round\r\nonce more at Arnold, and slowly tore the letter into fragments as he\r\nlooked.)\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Blanche had not done yet. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when Arnold\r\nproposed an adjournment to the garden; \xe2\x80\x9cI have something more to say,\r\nand you are interested in it, this time.\xe2\x80\x9d Arnold resigned himself to\r\nlisten, and worse still to answer, if there was no help for it, in the\r\ncharacter of an innocent stranger who had never been near the Craig\r\nFernie inn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Blanche resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cand what do you think has come of my letter to\r\nAnne?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing has come of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely nothing! I know she received the letter yesterday morning. I\r\nought to have had the answer to-day at breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she thought it didn\xe2\x80\x99t require an answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought that, for reasons that I know of. Besides, in\r\nmy letter yesterday I implored her to tell me (if it was one line only)\r\nwhether, in guessing at what her trouble was, Sir Patrick and I had not\r\nguessed right. And here is the day getting on, and no answer! What am I\r\nto conclude?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really can\xe2\x80\x99t say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible, Arnold, that we have _not_ guessed right, after all?\r\nIs the wickedness of that man who blew the candles out wickedness beyond\r\nour discovering? The doubt is so dreadful that I have made up my mind\r\nnot to bear it after to-day. I count on your sympathy and assistance\r\nwhen to-morrow comes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s heart sank. Some new complication was evidently gathering round\r\nhim. He waited in silence to hear the worst. Blanche bent forward, and\r\nwhispered to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a secret,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf that creature at the writing-table has\r\nears for any thing but rowing and racing, he mustn\xe2\x80\x99t hear this! Anne\r\nmay come to me privately to-day while you are all at luncheon. If she\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t come and if I don\xe2\x80\x99t hear from her, then the mystery of her\r\nsilence must be cleared up; and You must do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make difficulties! If you can\xe2\x80\x99t find your way to Craig Fernie, I\r\ncan help you. As for Anne, you know what a charming person she is, and\r\nyou know she will receive you perfectly, for my sake. I must and will\r\nhave some news of her. I can\xe2\x80\x99t break the laws of the household a second\r\ntime. Sir Patrick sympathizes, but he won\xe2\x80\x99t stir. Lady Lundie is a\r\nbitter enemy. The servants are threatened with the loss of their places\r\nif any one of them goes near Anne. There is nobody but you. And to Anne\r\nyou go to-morrow, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t see her or hear from her to-day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis to the man who had passed as Anne\xe2\x80\x99s husband at the inn, and who had\r\nbeen forced into the most intimate knowledge of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s miserable secret!\r\nArnold rose to put Milton away, with the composure of sheer despair.\r\nAny other secret he might, in the last resort, have confided to the\r\ndiscretion of a third person. But a woman\xe2\x80\x99s secret--with a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreputation depending on his keeping it--was not to be confided to any\r\nbody, under any stress of circumstances whatever. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Geoffrey doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget me out of _this,_,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall have no choice but to leave\r\nWindygates to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he replaced the book on the shelf, Lady Lundie entered the library\r\nfrom the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her step-daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImproving my mind,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Brinkworth and I have been\r\nreading Milton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you condescend so far, after reading Milton all the morning, as to\r\nhelp me with the invitations for the dinner next week?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf _you_ can condescend, Lady Lundie, after feeding the poultry all the\r\nmorning, I must be humility itself after only reading Milton!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that little interchange of the acid amenities of feminine\r\nintercourse, step-mother and step-daughter withdrew to a writing-table,\r\nto put the virtue of hospitality in practice together.\r\n\r\nArnold joined his friend at the other end of the library.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey was sitting with his elbows on the desk, and his clenched fists\r\ndug into his cheeks. Great drops of perspiration stood on his forehead,\r\nand the fragments of a torn letter lay scattered all round him. He\r\nexhibited symptoms of nervous sensibility for the first time in his\r\nlife--he started when Arnold spoke to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Geoffrey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA letter to answer. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Miss Silvester?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arnold, dropping his voice so as to prevent\r\nthe ladies at the other end of the room from hearing him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Geoffrey, in a lower voice still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard what Blanche has been saying to me about Miss\r\nSilvester?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear Blanche say that she meant to send me to Craig Fernie\r\nto-morrow, if she failed to get news from Miss Silvester to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you know it now. That is what Blanche has just said to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--there\xe2\x80\x99s a limit to what a man can expect even from his best\r\nfriend. I hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t ask me to be Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s messenger to-morrow. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t, and won\xe2\x80\x99t, go back to the inn as things are now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have had enough of it--eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had enough of distressing Miss Silvester, and more than enough\r\nof deceiving Blanche.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by \xe2\x80\x98distressing Miss Silvester?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take the same easy view that you and I do, Geoffrey, of my\r\npassing her off on the people of the inn as my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey absently took up a paper-knife. Still with his head down, he\r\nbegan shaving off the topmost layer of paper from the blotting-pad under\r\nhis hand. Still with his head down, he abruptly broke the silence in a\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you manage to pass her off as your wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI told you how, as we were driving from the station here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of something else. Tell me again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold told him once more what had happened at the inn. Geoffrey\r\nlistened, without making any remark. He balanced the paper-knife\r\nvacantly on one of his fingers. He was strangely sluggish and strangely\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll _that_ is done and ended,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold shaking him by the shoulder.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt rests with you now to get me out of the difficulty I\xe2\x80\x99m placed in\r\nwith Blanche. Things must be settled with Miss Silvester to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThings _shall_ be settled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall be? What are you waiting for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m waiting to do what you told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I told you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me to consult Sir Patrick before I married her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure! so I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--I am waiting for a chance with Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then--\xe2\x80\x9d He looked at Arnold for the first time. \xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou may consider it settled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe suddenly looked down again at the blotting-pad. \xe2\x80\x9cYes--the marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold offered his hand in congratulation. Geoffrey never noticed it.\r\nHis eyes were off the blotting-pad again. He was looking out of the\r\nwindow near him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t I hear voices outside?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe our friends are in the garden,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick may\r\nbe among them. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe instant his back was turned Geoffrey snatched up a sheet of\r\nnote-paper. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore I forget it!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. He wrote the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMemorandum\xe2\x80\x9d at the top of the page, and added these lines beneath it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe asked for her by the name of his wife at the door. He said, at\r\ndinner, before the landlady and the waiter, \xe2\x80\x98I take these rooms for my\r\nwife.\xe2\x80\x99 He made _her_ say he was her husband at the same time. After\r\nthat he stopped all night. What do the lawyers call this in\r\nScotland?--(Query: a marriage?)\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter folding up the paper he hesitated for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t do to trust to what Miss Lundie said about it. I can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\ncertain till I have consulted Sir Patrick himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put the paper away in his pocket, and wiped the heavy perspiration\r\nfrom his forehead. He was pale--for _him,_ strikingly pale--when Arnold\r\ncame back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny thing wrong, Geoffrey?--you\xe2\x80\x99re as white as ashes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the heat. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Sir Patrick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may see for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold pointed to the window. Sir Patrick was crossing the lawn, on\r\nhis way to the library with a newspaper in his hand; and the guests at\r\nWindygates were accompanying him. Sir Patrick was smiling, and saying\r\nnothing. The guests were talking excitedly at the tops of their voices.\r\nThere had apparently been a collision of some kind between the old\r\nschool and the new. Arnold directed Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s attention to the state of\r\naffairs on the lawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you to consult Sir Patrick with all those people about him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll consult Sir Patrick, if I take him by the scruff of the neck and\r\ncarry him into the next county!\xe2\x80\x9d He rose to his feet as he spoke those\r\nwords, and emphasized them under his breath with an oath.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick entered the library, with the guests at his heels.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE NINETEENTH.\r\n\r\nCLOSE ON IT.\r\n\r\nTHE object of the invasion of the library by the party in the garden\r\nappeared to be twofold.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick had entered the room to restore the newspaper to the place\r\nfrom which he had taken it. The guests, to the number of five, had\r\nfollowed him, to appeal in a body to Geoffrey Delamayn. Between these\r\ntwo apparently dissimilar motives there was a connection, not visible on\r\nthe surface, which was now to assert itself.\r\n\r\nOf the five guests, two were middle-aged gentlemen belonging to that\r\nlarge, but indistinct, division of the human family whom the hand of\r\nNature has painted in unobtrusive neutral tint. They had absorbed the\r\nideas of their time with such receptive capacity as they possessed;\r\nand they occupied much the same place in society which the chorus in an\r\nopera occupies on the stage. They echoed the prevalent sentiment of the\r\nmoment; and they gave the solo-talker time to fetch his breath.\r\n\r\nThe three remaining guests were on the right side of thirty. All\r\nprofoundly versed in horse-racing, in athletic sports, in pipes, beer,\r\nbilliards, and betting. All profoundly ignorant of every thing else\r\nunder the sun. All gentlemen by birth, and all marked as such by the\r\nstamp of \xe2\x80\x9ca University education.\xe2\x80\x9d They may be personally described as\r\nfaint reflections of Geoffrey; and they may be numerically distinguished\r\n(in the absence of all other distinction) as One, Two, and Three.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick laid the newspaper on the table and placed himself in one of\r\nthe comfortable arm-chairs. He was instantly assailed, in his domestic\r\ncapacity, by his irrepressible sister-in-law. Lady Lundie dispatched\r\nBlanche to him with the list of her guests at the dinner. \xe2\x80\x9cFor your\r\nuncle\xe2\x80\x99s approval, my dear, as head of the family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Sir Patrick was looking over the list, and while Arnold was making\r\nhis way to Blanche, at the back of her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s chair, One, Two, and\r\nThree--with the Chorus in attendance on them--descended in a body on\r\nGeoffrey, at the other end of the room, and appealed in rapid succession\r\nto his superior authority, as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Delamayn. We want You. Here is Sir Patrick running a regular\r\nMuck at us. Calls us aboriginal Britons. Tells us we ain\xe2\x80\x99t educated.\r\nDoubts if we could read, write, and cipher, if he tried us. Swears he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsick of fellows showing their arms and legs, and seeing which fellow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhardest, and who\xe2\x80\x99s got three belts of muscle across his wind, and who\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t, and the like of that. Says a most infernal thing of a chap.\r\nSays--because a chap likes a healthy out-of-door life, and trains for\r\nrowing and running, and the rest of it, and don\xe2\x80\x99t see his way to stewing\r\nover his books--_therefore_ he\xe2\x80\x99s safe to commit all the crimes in the\r\ncalendar, murder included. Saw your name down in the newspaper for the\r\nFoot-Race; and said, when we asked him if he\xe2\x80\x99d taken the odds, he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlay any odds we liked against you in the other Race at the\r\nUniversity--meaning, old boy, your Degree. Nasty, that about the\r\nDegree--in the opinion of Number One. Bad taste in Sir Patrick to rake\r\nup what we never mention among ourselves--in the opinion of Number Two.\r\nUn-English to sneer at a man in that way behind his back--in the opinion\r\nof Number Three. Bring him to book, Delamayn. Your name\xe2\x80\x99s in the papers;\r\nhe can\xe2\x80\x99t ride roughshod over You.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two choral gentlemen agreed (in the minor key) with the general\r\nopinion. \xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s views are certainly extreme, Smith?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI think,\r\nJones, it\xe2\x80\x99s desirable to hear Mr. Delamayn on the other side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey looked from one to the other of his admirers with an expression\r\non his face which was quite new to them, and with something in his\r\nmanner which puzzled them all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t argue with Sir Patrick yourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand you want me\r\nto do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne, Two, Three, and the Chorus all answered, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne, Two, Three, and the Chorus all asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Geoffrey, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re all wrong. And Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot astonishment only, but downright stupefaction, struck the deputation\r\nfrom the garden speechless.\r\n\r\nWithout saying a word more to any of the persons standing near him,\r\nGeoffrey walked straight up to Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s arm-chair, and personally\r\naddressed him. The satellites followed, and listened (as well they\r\nmight) in wonder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will lay any odds, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey \xe2\x80\x9cagainst me taking my\r\nDegree? You\xe2\x80\x99re quite right. I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t take my Degree. You doubt whether\r\nI, or any of those fellows behind me, could read, write, and cipher\r\ncorrectly if you tried us. You\xe2\x80\x99re right again--we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. You say you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know why men like Me, and men like Them, may not begin with rowing\r\nand running and the like of that, and end in committing all the crimes\r\nin the calendar: murder included. Well! you may be right again there.\r\nWho\xe2\x80\x99s to know what may happen to him? or what he may not end in doing\r\nbefore he dies? It may be Another, or it may be Me. How do I know?\r\nand how do you?\xe2\x80\x9d He suddenly turned on the deputation, standing\r\nthunder-struck behind him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to know what I think, there it\r\nis for you, in plain words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something, not only in the shamelessness of the declaration\r\nitself, but in the fierce pleasure that the speaker seemed to feel in\r\nmaking it, which struck the circle of listeners, Sir Patrick included,\r\nwith a momentary chill.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the silence a sixth guest appeared on the lawn, and\r\nstepped into the library--a silent, resolute, unassuming, elderly man\r\nwho had arrived the day before on a visit to Windygates, and who\r\nwas well known, in and out of London, as one of the first consulting\r\nsurgeons of his time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA discussion going on?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I in the way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no discussion--we are all agreed,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Geoffrey, answering\r\nboisterously for the rest. \xe2\x80\x9cThe more the merrier, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a glance at Geoffrey, the surgeon suddenly checked himself on the\r\npoint of advancing to the inner part of the room, and remained standing\r\nat the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick, addressing himself to Geoffrey,\r\nwith a grave dignity which was quite new in Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s experience of him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not all agreed. I decline, Mr. Delamayn, to allow you to connect\r\nme with such an expression of feeling on your part as we have just\r\nheard. The language you have used leaves me no alternative but to meet\r\nyour statement of what you suppose me to have said by my statement\r\nof what I really did say. It is not my fault if the discussion in the\r\ngarden is revived before another audience in this room--it is yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked as he spoke to Arnold and Blanche, and from them to the\r\nsurgeon standing at the window.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon had found an occupation for himself which completely\r\nisolated him among the rest of the guests. Keeping his own face in\r\nshadow, he was studying Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s face, in the full flood of light\r\nthat fell on it, with a steady attention which must have been generally\r\nremarked, if all eyes had not been turned toward Sir Patrick at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIt was not an easy face to investigate at that moment.\r\n\r\nWhile Sir Patrick had been speaking Geoffrey had seated himself near the\r\nwindow, doggedly impenetrable to the reproof of which he was the object.\r\nIn his impatience to consult the one authority competent to decide\r\nthe question of Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s position toward Anne, he had sided with Sir\r\nPatrick, as a means of ridding himself of the unwelcome presence of his\r\nfriends--and he had defeated his own purpose, thanks to his own brutish\r\nincapability of bridling himself in the pursuit of it. Whether he was\r\nnow discouraged under these circumstances, or whether he was simply\r\nresigned to bide his time till his time came, it was impossible, judging\r\nby outward appearances, to say. With a heavy dropping at the corners of\r\nhis mouth, with a stolid indifference staring dull in his eyes, there\r\nhe sat, a man forearmed, in his own obstinate neutrality, against all\r\ntemptation to engage in the conflict of opinions that was to come.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick took up the newspaper which he had brought in from the\r\ngarden, and looked once more to see if the surgeon was attending to him.\r\n\r\nNo! The surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s attention was absorbed in his own subject. There he\r\nwas in the same position, with his mind still hard at work on something\r\nin Geoffrey which at once interested and puzzled it! \xe2\x80\x9cThat man,\xe2\x80\x9d he was\r\nthinking to himself, \xe2\x80\x9chas come here this morning after traveling from\r\nLondon all night. Does any ordinary fatigue explain what I see in his\r\nface? No!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur little discussion in the garden,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Sir Patrick, answering\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s inquiring look as she bent over him, \xe2\x80\x9cbegan, my dear, in a\r\nparagraph here announcing Mr. Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s forthcoming appearance in a\r\nfoot-race in the neighborhood of London. I hold very unpopular opinions\r\nas to the athletic displays which are so much in vogue in England just\r\nnow. And it is possible that I may have expressed those opinions a\r\nlittle too strongly, in the heat of discussion, with gentlemen who\r\nare opposed to me--I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt, conscientiously opposed--on this\r\nquestion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA low groan of protest rose from One, Two, and Three, in return for the\r\nlittle compliment which Sir Patrick had paid to them. \xe2\x80\x9cHow about rowing\r\nand running ending in the Old Bailey and the gallows? You said that,\r\nSir--you know you did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two choral gentlemen looked at each other, and agreed with the\r\nprevalent sentiment. \xe2\x80\x9cIt came to that, I think, Smith.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Jones, it\r\ncertainly came to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe only two men who still cared nothing about it were Geoffrey and the\r\nsurgeon. There sat the first, stolidly neutral--indifferent alike to\r\nthe attack and the defense. There stood the second, pursuing his\r\ninvestigation--with the growing interest in it of a man who was\r\nbeginning to see his way to the end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear my defense, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Sir Patrick, as courteously\r\nas ever. \xe2\x80\x9cYou belong, remember, to a nation which especially claims to\r\npractice the rules of fair play. I must beg to remind you of what I said\r\nin the garden. I started with a concession. I admitted--as every person\r\nof the smallest sense must admit--that a man will, in the great majority\r\nof cases, be all the fitter for mental exercise if he wisely combines\r\nphysical exercise along with it. The whole question between the two is a\r\nquestion of proportion and degree, and my complaint of the present time\r\nis that the present time doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see it. Popular opinion in England\r\nseems to me to be, not only getting to consider the cultivation of the\r\nmuscles as of equal importance with the cultivation of the mind, but to\r\nbe actually extending--in practice, if not in theory--to the absurd\r\nand dangerous length of putting bodily training in the first place of\r\nimportance, and mental training in the second. To take a case in point:\r\nI can discover no enthusiasm in the nation any thing like so genuine and\r\nany thing like so general as the enthusiasm excited by your University\r\nboat-race. Again: I see this Athletic Education of yours made a\r\nmatter of public celebration in schools and colleges; and I ask any\r\nunprejudiced witness to tell me which excites most popular enthusiasm,\r\nand which gets the most prominent place in the public journals--the\r\nexhibition, indoors (on Prize-day), of what the boys can do with their\r\nminds? or the exhibition, out of doors (on Sports-day), of what the\r\nboys can do with their bodies? You know perfectly well which performance\r\nexcites the loudest cheers, which occupies the prominent place in the\r\nnewspapers, and which, as a necessary consequence, confers the highest\r\nsocial honors on the hero of the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother murmur from One, Two, and Three. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have nothing to say to\r\nthat, Sir; have it all your own way, so far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother ratification of agreement with the prevalent opinion between\r\nSmith and Jones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are all of one mind as to which\r\nway the public feeling sets. If it is a feeling to be respected and\r\nencouraged, show me the national advantage which has resulted from it.\r\nWhere is the influence of this modern outburst of manly enthusiasm on\r\nthe serious concerns of life? and how has it improved the character of\r\nthe people at large? Are we any of us individually readier than we ever\r\nwere to sacrifice our own little private interests to the public good?\r\nAre we dealing with the serious social questions of our time in a\r\nconspicuously determined, downright, and definite way? Are we becoming a\r\nvisibly and indisputably purer people in our code of commercial morals?\r\nIs there a healthier and higher tone in those public amusements which\r\nfaithfully reflect in all countries the public taste? Produce me\r\naffirmative answers to these questions, which rest on solid proof, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll accept the present mania for athletic sports as something better\r\nthan an outbreak of our insular boastfulness and our insular barbarity\r\nin a new form.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuestion! question!\xe2\x80\x9d in a general cry, from One, Two, and Three.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuestion! question!\xe2\x80\x9d in meek reverberation, from Smith and Jones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the question,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cYou admit the existence\r\nof the public feeling and I ask, what good does it do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat harm does it do?\xe2\x80\x9d from One, Two, and Three.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear! hear!\xe2\x80\x9d from Smith and Jones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fair challenge,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cI am bound to meet you\r\non that new ground. I won\xe2\x80\x99t point, gentlemen, by way of answer, to the\r\ncoarseness which I can see growing on our national manners, or to the\r\ndeterioration which appears to me to be spreading more and more widely\r\nin our national tastes. You may tell me with perfect truth that I am too\r\nold a man to be a fair judge of manners and tastes which have got beyond\r\nmy standards. We will try the issue, as it now stands between us, on its\r\nabstract merits only. I assert that a state of public feeling which does\r\npractically place physical training, in its estimation, above moral and\r\nmental training, is a positively bad and dangerous state of feeling in\r\nthis, that it encourages the inbred reluctance in humanity to submit to\r\nthe demands which moral and mental cultivation must inevitably make on\r\nit. Which am I, as a boy, naturally most ready to do--to try how high I\r\ncan jump? or to try how much I can learn? Which training comes easiest\r\nto me as a young man? The training which teaches me to handle an oar?\r\nor the training which teaches me to return good for evil, and to love\r\nmy neighbor as myself? Of those two experiments, of those two trainings,\r\nwhich ought society in England to meet with the warmest encouragement?\r\nAnd which does society in England practically encourage, as a matter of\r\nfact?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say yourself just now?\xe2\x80\x9d from One, Two, and Three.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemarkably well put!\xe2\x80\x9d from Smith and Jones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a man will go all the better\r\nto his books for his healthy physical exercise. And I say that\r\nagain--provided the physical exercise be restrained within fit limits.\r\nBut when public feeling enters into the question, and directly exalts\r\nthe bodily exercises above the books--then I say public feeling is in a\r\ndangerous extreme. The bodily exercises, in that case, will be uppermost\r\nin the youth\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts, will have the strongest hold on his\r\ninterest, will take the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of his time, and will, by those\r\nmeans--barring the few purely exceptional instances--slowly and surely\r\nend in leaving him, to all good moral and mental purpose, certainly an\r\nuncultivated, and, possibly, a dangerous man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA cry from the camp of the adversaries: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got to it at last! A man\r\nwho leads an out-of-door life, and uses the strength that God has given\r\nto him, is a dangerous man. Did any body ever hear the like of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCry reverberated, with variations, by the two human echoes: \xe2\x80\x9cNo! Nobody\r\never heard the like of that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClear your minds of cant, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nagricultural laborer leads an out-of-door life, and uses the strength\r\nthat God has given to him. The sailor in the merchant service does the\r\nname. Both are an uncultivated, a shamefully uncultivated, class--and\r\nsee the result! Look at the Map of Crime, and you will find the most\r\nhideous offenses in the calendar, committed--not in the towns, where the\r\naverage man doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lead an out-of-door life, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t as a rule, use his\r\nstrength, but is, as a rule, comparatively cultivated--not in the towns,\r\nbut in the agricultural districts. As for the English sailor--except\r\nwhen the Royal Navy catches and cultivates him--ask Mr. Brinkworth,\r\nwho has served in the merchant navy, what sort of specimen of the moral\r\ninfluence of out-of-door life and muscular cultivation _he_ is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn nine cases out of ten,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold, \xe2\x80\x9che is as idle and vicious as\r\nruffian as walks the earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother cry from the Opposition: \xe2\x80\x9cAre _we_ agricultural laborers? Are\r\n_we_ sailors in the merchant service?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA smart reverberation from the human echoes: \xe2\x80\x9cSmith! am I a laborer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cJones! am I a sailor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray let us not be personal, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nspeaking generally, and I can only meet extreme objections by pushing\r\nmy argument to extreme limits. The laborer and the sailor have served my\r\npurpose. If the laborer and the sailor offend you, by all means let them\r\nwalk off the stage! I hold to the position which I advanced just now. A\r\nman may be well born, well off, well dressed, well fed--but if he is an\r\nuncultivated man, he is (in spite of all those advantages) a man with\r\nspecial capacities for evil in him, on that very account. Don\xe2\x80\x99t mistake\r\nme! I am far from saving that the present rage for exclusively muscular\r\naccomplishments must lead inevitably downward to the lowest deep of\r\ndepravity. Fortunately for society, all special depravity is more or\r\nless certainly the result, in the first instance, of special temptation.\r\nThe ordinary mass of us, thank God, pass through life without being\r\nexposed to other than ordinary temptations. Thousands of the young\r\ngentlemen, devoted to the favorite pursuits of the present time, will\r\nget through existence with no worse consequences to themselves than\r\na coarse tone of mind and manners, and a lamentable incapability of\r\nfeeling any of those higher and gentler influences which sweeten and\r\npurify the lives of more cultivated men. But take the other case (which\r\nmay occur to any body), the case of a special temptation trying a modern\r\nyoung man of your prosperous class and of mine. And let me beg Mr.\r\nDelamayn to honor with his attention what I have now to say, because it\r\nrefers to the opinion which I did really express--as distinguished from\r\nthe opinion which he affects to agree with, and which I never advanced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s indifference showed no signs of giving way. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid--and still sat looking straight before him, with heavy eyes, which\r\nnoticed nothing, and expressed nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake the example which we have now in view,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Sir Patrick--\xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nexample of an average young gentleman of our time, blest with every\r\nadvantage that physical cultivation can bestow on him. Let this man be\r\ntried by a temptation which insidiously calls into action, in his own\r\ninterests, the savage instincts latent in humanity--the instincts of\r\nself-seeking and cruelty which are at the bottom of all crime. Let this\r\nman be placed toward some other person, guiltless of injuring him, in a\r\nposition which demands one of two sacrifices: the sacrifice of the other\r\nperson, or the sacrifice of his own interests and his own desires.\r\nHis neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s happiness, or his neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s life, stands, let us say,\r\nbetween him and the attainment of something that he wants. He can wreck\r\nthe happiness, or strike down the life, without, to his knowledge, any\r\nfear of suffering for it himself. What is to prevent him, being the man\r\nhe is, from going straight to his end, on those conditions? Will the\r\nskill in rowing, the swiftness in running, the admirable capacity and\r\nendurance in other physical exercises, which he has attained, by a\r\nstrenuous cultivation in this kind that has excluded any similarly\r\nstrenuous cultivation in other kinds--will these physical attainments\r\nhelp him to win a purely moral victory over his own selfishness and his\r\nown cruelty? They won\xe2\x80\x99t even help him to see that it _is_ selfishness,\r\nand that it _is_ cruelty. The essential principle of his rowing and\r\nracing (a harmless principle enough, if you can be sure of applying it\r\nto rowing and racing only) has taught him to take every advantage of\r\nanother man that his superior strength and superior cunning can suggest.\r\nThere has been nothing in his training to soften the barbarous hardness\r\nin his heart, and to enlighten the barbarous darkness in his mind.\r\nTemptation finds this man defenseless, when temptation passes his way.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t care who he is, or how high he stands accidentally in the social\r\nscale--he is, to all moral intents and purposes, an Animal, and nothing\r\nmore. If my happiness stands in his way--and if he can do it with\r\nimpunity to himself--he will trample down my happiness. If my life\r\nhappens to be the next obstacle he encounters--and if he can do it with\r\nimpunity to himself--he will trample down my life. Not, Mr. Delamayn, in\r\nthe character of a victim to irresistible fatality, or to blind chance;\r\nbut in the character of a man who has sown the seed, and reaps the\r\nharvest. That, Sir, is the case which I put as an extreme case only,\r\nwhen this discussion began. As an extreme case only--but as a perfectly\r\npossible case, at the same time--I restate it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore the advocates of the other side of the question could open their\r\nlips to reply, Geoffrey suddenly flung off his indifference, and started\r\nto his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, threatening the others, in his fierce impatience to\r\nanswer for himself, with his clenched fist.\r\n\r\nThere was a general silence.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey turned and looked at Sir Patrick, as if Sir Patrick had\r\npersonally insulted him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is this anonymous man, who finds his way to his own ends, and\r\npities nobody and sticks at nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cGive him a name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quoting an example,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not attacking a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat right have you,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Geoffrey--utterly forgetful, in the strange\r\nexasperation that had seized on him, of the interest that he had in\r\ncontrolling himself before Sir Patrick--\xe2\x80\x9cwhat right have you to pick out\r\nan example of a rowing man who is an infernal scoundrel--when it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nquite as likely that a rowing man may be a good fellow: ay! and a better\r\nfellow, if you come to that, than ever stood in your shoes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the one case is quite as likely to occur as the other (which I\r\nreadily admit),\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cI have surely a right to choose\r\nwhich case I please for illustration. (Wait, Mr. Delamayn! These are\r\nthe last words I have to say and I mean to say them.) I have taken\r\nthe example--not of a specially depraved man, as you erroneously\r\nsuppose--but of an average man, with his average share of the mean,\r\ncruel, and dangerous qualities, which are part and parcel of unreformed\r\nhuman nature--as your religion tells you, and as you may see for\r\nyourself, if you choose to look at your untaught fellow-creatures any\r\nwhere. I suppose that man to be tried by a temptation to wickedness, out\r\nof the common; and I show, to the best of my ability, how completely the\r\nmoral and mental neglect of himself, which the present material tone\r\nof public feeling in England has tacitly encouraged, leaves him at the\r\nmercy of all the worst instincts in his nature; and how surely, under\r\nthose conditions, he _must_ go down (gentleman as he is) step by\r\nstep--as the lowest vagabond in the streets goes down under _his_\r\nspecial temptation--from the beginning in ignorance to the end in crime.\r\nIf you deny my right to take such an example as that, in illustration of\r\nthe views I advocate, you must either deny that a special temptation to\r\nwickedness can assail a man in the position of a gentleman, or you must\r\nassert that gentlemen who are naturally superior to all temptation are\r\nthe only gentlemen who devote themselves to athletic pursuits. There\r\nis my defense. In stating my case, I have spoken out of my own sincere\r\nrespect for the interests of virtue and of learning; out of my own\r\nsincere admiration for those young men among us who are resisting the\r\ncontagion of barbarism about them. In _their_ future is the future hope\r\nof England. I have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAngrily ready with a violent personal reply, Geoffrey found himself\r\nchecked, in his turn by another person with something to say, and with a\r\nresolution to say it at that particular moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some little time past the surgeon had discontinued his steady\r\ninvestigation of Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s face, and had given all his attention to the\r\ndiscussion, with the air of a man whose self-imposed task had come to\r\nan end. As the last sentence fell from the last speaker\xe2\x80\x99s lips, he\r\ninterposed so quickly and so skillfully between Geoffrey and Sir\r\nPatrick, that Geoffrey himself was taken by surprise,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is something still wanting to make Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s statement of the\r\ncase complete,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I can supply it, from the result of\r\nmy own professional experience. Before I say what I have to say, Mr.\r\nDelamayn will perhaps excuse me, if I venture on giving him a caution to\r\ncontrol himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre _you_ going to make a dead set at me, too?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Geoffrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am recommending you to keep your temper--nothing more. There are\r\nplenty of men who can fly into a passion without doing themselves any\r\nparticular harm. You are not one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think the state of your health, Mr. Delamayn, is quite so\r\nsatisfactory as you may be disposed to consider it yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey turned to his admirers and adherents with a roar of derisive\r\nlaughter. The admirers and adherents all echoed him together. Arnold\r\nand Blanche smiled at each other. Even Sir Patrick looked as if he\r\ncould hardly credit the evidence of his own ears. There stood the modern\r\nHercules, self-vindicated as a Hercules, before all eyes that looked at\r\nhim. And there, opposite, stood a man whom he could have killed with one\r\nblow of his fist, telling him, in serious earnest, that he was not in\r\nperfect health!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a rare fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey, half in jest and half in anger.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have undertaken to give you, what I believe to be, a necessary\r\ncaution,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the surgeon. \xe2\x80\x9cI have _not_ undertaken to tell\r\nyou what I think is the matter with you. That may be a question for\r\nconsideration some little time hence. In the meanwhile, I should like\r\nto put my impression about you to the test. Have you any objection to\r\nanswer a question on a matter of no particular importance relating to\r\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s hear the question first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have noticed something in your behavior while Sir Patrick was\r\nspeaking. You are as much interested in opposing his views as any of\r\nthose gentlemen about you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand your sitting in\r\nsilence, and leaving it entirely to the others to put the case on your\r\nside--until Sir Patrick said something which happened to irritate you.\r\nHad you, all the time before that, no answer ready in your own mind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had as good answers in my mind as any that have been made here\r\nto-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet you didn\xe2\x80\x99t give them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t give them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you felt--though you knew your objections to be good ones--that\r\nit was hardly worth while to take the trouble of putting them into\r\nwords? In short, you let your friends answer for you, rather than make\r\nthe effort of answering for yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey looked at his medical adviser with a sudden curiosity and a\r\nsudden distrust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you come to know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in my\r\nmind--without my telling you of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my business to find out what is going on in people\xe2\x80\x99s bodies--and\r\nto do that it is sometimes necessary for me to find out (if I can) what\r\nis going on in their minds. If I have rightly interpreted what was going\r\non in _your_ mind, there is no need for me to press my question. You\r\nhave answered it already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned to Sir Patrick next\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a side to this subject,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich you have not touched\r\non yet. There is a Physical objection to the present rage for muscular\r\nexercises of all sorts, which is quite as strong, in its way, as the\r\nMoral objection. You have stated the consequences as they _may_ affect\r\nthe mind. I can state the consequences as they _do_ affect the body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom your own experience?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom my own experience. I can tell you, as a medical man, that a\r\nproportion, and not by any means a small one, of the young men who are\r\nnow putting themselves to violent athletic tests of their strength and\r\nendurance, are taking that course to the serious and permanent injury of\r\ntheir own health. The public who attend rowing-matches, foot-races, and\r\nother exhibitions of that sort, see nothing but the successful results\r\nof muscular training. Fathers and mothers at home see the failures.\r\nThere are households in England--miserable households, to be counted,\r\nSir Patrick, by more than ones and twos--in which there are young men\r\nwho have to thank the strain laid on their constitutions by the popular\r\nphysical displays of the present time, for being broken men, and\r\ninvalided men, for the rest of their lives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick, looking at Geoffrey.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey carelessly nodded his head. His irritation had had time to\r\nsubside; the stolid indifference had got possession of him again. He had\r\nresumed his chair--he sat, with outstretched legs, staring stupidly\r\nat the pattern on the carpet. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it matter to Me?\xe2\x80\x9d was the\r\nsentiment expressed all over him, from head to foot.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can see no remedy for this sad state of things,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cas long\r\nas the public feeling remains what the public feeling is now. A fine\r\nhealthy-looking young man, with a superb muscular development,\r\nlongs (naturally enough) to distinguish himself like others. The\r\ntraining-authorities at his college, or elsewhere, take him in hand\r\n(naturally enough again) on the strength of outward appearances. And\r\nwhether they have been right or wrong in choosing him is more than they\r\ncan say, until the experiment has been tried, and the mischief has been,\r\nin many cases, irretrievably done. How many of them are aware of the\r\nimportant physiological truth, that the muscular power of a man is no\r\nfair guarantee of his vital power? How many of them know that we all\r\nhave (as a great French writer puts it) two lives in us--the surface\r\nlife of the muscles, and the inner life of the heart, lungs, and brain?\r\nEven if they did know this--even with medical men to help them--it would\r\nbe in the last degree doubtful, in most cases, whether any previous\r\nexamination would result in any reliable discovery of the vital fitness\r\nof the man to undergo the stress of muscular exertion laid on him. Apply\r\nto any of my brethren; and they will tell you, as the result of their\r\nown professional observation, that I am, in no sense, overstating this\r\nserious evil, or exaggerating the deplorable and dangerous consequences\r\nto which it leads. I have a patient at this moment, who is a young man\r\nof twenty, and who possesses one of the finest muscular developments\r\nI ever saw in my life. If that young man had consulted me, before\r\nhe followed the example of the other young men about him, I can not\r\nhonestly say that I could have foreseen the results. As things are,\r\nafter going through a certain amount of muscular training, after\r\nperforming a certain number of muscular feats, he suddenly fainted one\r\nday, to the astonishment of his family and friends. I was called in and\r\nI have watched the case since. He will probably live, but he will never\r\nrecover. I am obliged to take precautions with this youth of twenty\r\nwhich I should take with an old man of eighty. He is big enough and\r\nmuscular enough to sit to a painter as a model for Samson--and only last\r\nweek I saw him swoon away like a young girl, in his mother\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cName!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s admirers, still fighting the battle on their\r\nside, in the absence of any encouragement from Geoffrey himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not in the habit of mentioning my patients\xe2\x80\x99 names,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\nsurgeon. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you insist on my producing an example of a man broken\r\nby athletic exercises, I can do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo it! Who is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou all know him perfectly well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he in the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s hands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a pause of breathless silence--with the eyes of every person in the\r\nroom eagerly fastened on him--the surgeon lifted his hand and pointed to\r\nGeoffrey Delamayn.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE TWENTIETH.\r\n\r\nTOUCHING IT.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the general stupefaction was allayed, the general incredulity\r\nasserted itself as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nThe man who first declared that \xe2\x80\x9cseeing\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cbelieving\xe2\x80\x9d laid his finger\r\n(whether he knew it himself or not) on one of the fundamental follies\r\nof humanity. The easiest of all evidence to receive is the evidence\r\nthat requires no other judgment to decide on it than the judgment of\r\nthe eye--and it will be, on that account, the evidence which humanity is\r\nmost ready to credit, as long as humanity lasts. The eyes of every\r\nbody looked at Geoffrey; and the judgment of every body decided, on\r\nthe evidence there visible, that the surgeon must be wrong. Lady Lundie\r\nherself (disturbed over her dinner invitations) led the general protest.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Delamayn in broken health!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, appealing to the better\r\nsense of her eminent medical guest. \xe2\x80\x9cReally, now, you can\xe2\x80\x99t expect us to\r\nbelieve that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStung into action for the second time by the startling assertion of\r\nwhich he had been made the subject, Geoffrey rose, and looked the\r\nsurgeon, steadily and insolently, straight in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean what you say?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou point me out before all these people--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne moment, Mr. Delamayn. I admit that I may have been wrong in\r\ndirecting the general attention to you. You have a right to complain of\r\nmy having answered too publicly the public challenge offered to me by\r\nyour friends. I apologize for having done that. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t retract a\r\nsingle word of what I have said on the subject of your health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou stick to it that I\xe2\x80\x99m a broken-down man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you were twenty years younger, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d ask you to step out on the lawn there and I\xe2\x80\x99d show you whether I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\na broken-down man or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie looked at her brother-in-law. Sir Patrick instantly\r\ninterfered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Delamayn,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou were invited here in the character of a\r\ngentleman, and you are a guest in a lady\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! no!\xe2\x80\x9d said the surgeon, good humoredly. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Delamayn is using a\r\nstrong argument, Sir Patrick--and that is all. If I _were_ twenty years\r\nyounger,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, addressing himself to Geoffrey, \xe2\x80\x9cand if I _did_\r\nstep out on the lawn with you, the result wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t affect the question\r\nbetween us in the least. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that the violent bodily exercises\r\nin which you are famous have damaged your muscular power. I assert that\r\nthey have damaged your vital power. In what particular way they have\r\naffected it I don\xe2\x80\x99t consider myself bound to tell you. I simply give\r\nyou a warning, as a matter of common humanity. You will do well to\r\nbe content with the success you have already achieved in the field of\r\nathletic pursuits, and to alter your mode of life for the future.\r\nAccept my excuses, once more, for having said this publicly instead of\r\nprivately--and don\xe2\x80\x99t forget my warning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned to move away to another part of the room. Geoffrey fairly\r\nforced him to return to the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have had your innings. My turn now. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngive it words as you do; but I can come to the point. And, by the Lord,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll fix you to it! In ten days or a fortnight from this I\xe2\x80\x99m going into\r\ntraining for the Foot-Race at Fulham. Do you say I shall break down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will probably get through your training.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I get through the race?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may _possibly_ get through the race. But if you do--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will never run another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd never row in another match?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been asked to row in the Race, next spring; and I have said I\r\nwill. Do you tell me, in so many words, that I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t be able to do\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--in so many words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPositively?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPositively.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBack your opinion!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Geoffrey, tearing his betting-book out of his\r\npocket. \xe2\x80\x9cI lay you an even hundred I\xe2\x80\x99m in fit condition to row in the\r\nUniversity Match next spring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t bet, Mr. Delamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that final reply the surgeon walked away to the other end of the\r\nlibrary. Lady Lundie (taking Blanche in custody) withdrew, at the same\r\ntime, to return to the serious business of her invitations for the\r\ndinner. Geoffrey turned defiantly, book in hand, to his college friends\r\nabout him. The British blood was up; and the British resolution to bet,\r\nwhich successfully defies common decency and common-law from one end of\r\nthe country to the other, was not to be trifled with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cBack the doctor, one of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick rose in undisguised disgust, and followed the surgeon. One,\r\nTwo, and Three, invited to business by their illustrious friend, shook\r\ntheir thick heads at him knowingly, and answered with one accord, in one\r\neloquent word--\xe2\x80\x9cGammon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of _you_ back him!\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Geoffrey, appealing to the two choral\r\ngentlemen in the back-ground, with his temper fast rising to fever heat.\r\nThe two choral gentlemen compared notes, as usual. \xe2\x80\x9cWe weren\xe2\x80\x99t born\r\nyesterday, Smith?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNot if we know it, Jones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmith!\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey, with a sudden assumption of politeness ominous\r\nof something unpleasant to come.\r\n\r\nSmith said \xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d--with a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJones!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJones said \xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d--with a reflection of Smith.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a couple of infernal cads--and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a hundred pound\r\nbetween you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome! come!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold, interfering for the first time. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\nshameful, Geoffrey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy the\xe2\x80\x9d--(never mind what!)--\xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t they any of them take the bet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you must be a fool,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Arnold, a little irritably on his\r\nside, \xe2\x80\x9cand if nothing else will keep you quiet, _I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ take the bet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn even hundred on the doctor!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cDone with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis highest aspirations were satisfied; his temper was in perfect order\r\nagain. He entered the bet in his book; and made his excuses to Smith and\r\nJones in the heartiest way. \xe2\x80\x9cNo offense, old chaps! Shake hands!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n The two choral gentlemen were enchanted with him. \xe2\x80\x9cThe English\r\naristocracy--eh, Smith?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBlood and breeding--ah, Jones!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had spoken, Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s conscience reproached him: not for\r\nbetting (who is ashamed of _that_ form of gambling in England?) but for\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbacking the doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d With the best intention toward his friend, he was\r\nspeculating on the failure of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s health. He anxiously assured\r\nGeoffrey that no man in the room could be more heartily persuaded that\r\nthe surgeon was wrong than himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t cry off from the bet,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear fellow, pray understand that I only take it to\r\nplease _you._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBother all that!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Geoffrey, with the steady eye to business,\r\nwhich was one of the choicest virtues in his character. \xe2\x80\x9cA bet\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nbet--and hang your sentiment!\xe2\x80\x9d He drew Arnold by the arm out of ear-shot\r\nof the others. \xe2\x80\x9cI say!\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, anxiously. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I\xe2\x80\x99ve set the\r\nold fogy\xe2\x80\x99s back up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean Sir Patrick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey nodded, and went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t put that little matter to him yet--about marrying in\r\nScotland, you know. Suppose he cuts up rough with me if I try him now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n His eye wandered cunningly, as he put the question, to the farther end\r\nof the room. The surgeon was looking over a port-folio of prints. The\r\nladies were still at work on their notes of invitation. Sir Patrick was\r\nalone at the book-shelves immersed in a volume which he had just taken\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake an apology,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick may be a little\r\nirritable and bitter; but he\xe2\x80\x99s a just man and a kind man. Say you were\r\nnot guilty of any intentional disrespect toward him--and you will say\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick, deep in an old Venetian edition of The Decameron, found\r\nhimself suddenly recalled from medieval Italy to modern England, by no\r\nless a person than Geoffrey Delamayn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to make an apology,\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cLet by-gones be\r\nby-gones--and that sort of thing. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t guilty of any intentional\r\ndisrespect toward you. Forgive and forget. Not half a bad motto,\r\nSir--eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was clumsily expressed--but still it was an apology. Not even\r\nGeoffrey could appeal to Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s courtesy and Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconsideration in vain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word more, Mr. Delamayn!\xe2\x80\x9d said the polite old man. \xe2\x80\x9cAccept my\r\nexcuses for any thing which I may have said too sharply, on my side; and\r\nlet us by all means forget the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving met the advance made to him, in those terms, he paused,\r\nexpecting Geoffrey to leave him free to return to the Decameron. To\r\nhis unutterable astonishment, Geoffrey suddenly stooped over him, and\r\nwhispered in his ear, \xe2\x80\x9cI want a word in private with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick started back, as if Geoffrey had tried to bite him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Mr. Delamayn--what did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould you give me a word in private?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick put back the Decameron; and bowed in freezing silence. The\r\nconfidence of the Honorable Geoffrey Delamayn was the last confidence in\r\nthe world into which he desired to be drawn. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the secret of the\r\napology!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can he possibly want with Me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about a friend of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Geoffrey; leading the way toward\r\none of the windows. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s in a scrape, my friend is. And I want to ask\r\nyour advice. It\xe2\x80\x99s strictly private, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d There he came to a full\r\nstop--and looked to see what impression he had produced, so far.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick declined, either by word or gesture, to exhibit the\r\nslightest anxiety to hear a word more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you mind taking a turn in the garden?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Geoffrey.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick pointed to his lame foot. \xe2\x80\x9cI have had my allowance of\r\nwalking this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet my infirmity excuse me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey looked about him for a substitute for the garden, and led the\r\nway back again toward one of the convenient curtained recesses opening\r\nout of the inner wall of the library. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall be private enough here,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick made a final effort to escape the proposed conference--an\r\nundisguised effort, this time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray forgive me, Mr. Delamayn. Are you quite sure that you apply to the\r\nright person, in applying to _me?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a Scotch lawyer, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you understand about Scotch marriages--eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s manner suddenly altered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs _that_ the subject you wish to consult me on?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not me. It\xe2\x80\x99s my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour friend, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It\xe2\x80\x99s a scrape with a woman. Here in Scotland. My friend don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhether he\xe2\x80\x99s married to her or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am at your service, Mr. Delamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s relief--by no means unmixed with surprise--Sir Patrick not\r\nonly showed no further reluctance to be consulted by him, but actually\r\nadvanced to meet his wishes, by leading the way to the recess that was\r\nnearest to them. The quick brain of the old lawyer had put Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napplication to him for assistance, and Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s application to him for\r\nassistance, together; and had built its own theory on the basis thus\r\nobtained. \xe2\x80\x9cDo I see a connection between the present position of\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s governess, and the present position of Mr. Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x98friend?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d thought Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cStranger extremes than _that_ have met\r\nme in my experience. Something may come out of this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two strangely-assorted companions seated themselves, one on each\r\nside of a little table in the recess. Arnold and the other guests had\r\nidled out again on to the lawn. The surgeon with his prints, and the\r\nladies with their invitations, were safely absorbed in a distant part\r\nof the library. The conference between the two men, so trifling in\r\nappearance, so terrible in its destined influence, not over Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfuture only, but over the future of Arnold and Blanche, was, to all\r\npractical purposes, a conference with closed doors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is the question?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe question,\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey, \xe2\x80\x9cis whether my friend is married to her\r\nor not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he mean to marry her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe being a single man, and she being a single woman, at the time? And\r\nboth in Scotland?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Now tell me the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey hesitated. The art of stating circumstances implies the\r\ncultivation of a very rare gift--the gift of arranging ideas. No one\r\nwas better acquainted with this truth than Sir Patrick. He was purposely\r\npuzzling Geoffrey at starting, under the firm conviction that his\r\nclient had something to conceal from him. The one process that could be\r\ndepended on for extracting the truth, under those circumstances, was\r\nthe process of interrogation. If Geoffrey was submitted to it, at the\r\noutset, his cunning might take the alarm. Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s object was\r\nto make the man himself invite interrogation. Geoffrey invited it\r\nforthwith, by attempting to state the circumstances, and by involving\r\nthem in the usual confusion. Sir Patrick waited until he had thoroughly\r\nlost the thread of his narrative--and then played for the winning trick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould it be easier to you if I asked a few questions?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired,\r\ninnocently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch easier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am quite at your service. Suppose we clear the ground to begin with?\r\nAre you at liberty to mention names?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlaces?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDates?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want me to be particular?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe as particular as you can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it do, if I say the present year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Were your friend and the lady--at some time in the present\r\nyear--traveling together in Scotland?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiving together in Scotland?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _were_ they doing together in Scotland?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--they were meeting each other at an inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh? They were meeting each other at an inn. Which was first at the\r\nrendezvous?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe woman was first. Stop a bit! We are getting to it now.\xe2\x80\x9d He produced\r\nfrom his pocket the written memorandum of Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings at Craig\r\nFernie, which he had taken down from Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s own lips. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bit\r\nof note here,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you\xe2\x80\x99d like to have a look at it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick took the note--read it rapidly through to himself--then\r\nre-read it, sentence by sentence, to Geoffrey; using it as a text to\r\nspeak from, in making further inquiries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98He asked for her by the name of his wife, at the door,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d read\r\nSir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cMeaning, I presume, the door of the inn? Had the lady\r\npreviously given herself out as a married woman to the people of the\r\ninn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long had she been at the inn before the gentleman joined her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly an hour or so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she give a name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t be quite sure--I should say not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid the gentleman give a name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I\xe2\x80\x99m certain _he_ didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick returned to the memorandum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98He said at dinner, before the landlady and the waiter, I take these\r\nrooms for my wife. He made _her_ say he was her husband, at the same\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x99 Was that done jocosely, Mr. Delamayn--either by the lady or the\r\ngentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. It was done in downright earnest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean it was done to look like earnest, and so to deceive the\r\nlandlady and the waiter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick returned to the memorandum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98After that, he stopped all night.\xe2\x80\x99 Stopped in the rooms he had taken\r\nfor himself and his wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what happened the next day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went away. Wait a bit! Said he had business for an excuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say, he kept up the deception with the people of the inn?\r\nand left the lady behind him, in the character of his wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he go back to the inn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long did the lady stay there, after he had gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe staid--well, she staid a few days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your friend has not seen her since?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre your friend and the lady English or Scotch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth English.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the time when they met at the inn, had they either of them arrived\r\nin Scotland, from the place in which they were previously living, within\r\na period of less than twenty-one days?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey hesitated. There could be no difficulty in answering for Anne.\r\nLady Lundie and her domestic circle had occupied Windygates for a much\r\nlonger period than three weeks before the date of the lawn-party. The\r\nquestion, as it affected Arnold, was the only question that required\r\nreflection. After searching his memory for details of the conversation\r\nwhich had taken place between them, when he and Arnold had met at the\r\nlawn-party, Geoffrey recalled a certain reference on the part of his\r\nfriend to a performance at the Edinburgh theatre, which at once decided\r\nthe question of time. Arnold had been necessarily detained in Edinburgh,\r\nbefore his arrival at Windygates, by legal business connected with his\r\ninheritance; and he, like Anne, had certainly been in Scotland, before\r\nthey met at Craig Fernie, for a longer period than a period of three\r\nweeks He accordingly informed Sir Patrick that the lady and gentleman\r\nhad been in Scotland for more than twenty-one days--and then added a\r\nquestion on his own behalf: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let me hurry you, Sir--but, shall you\r\nsoon have done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have done, after two more questions,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sir Patrick.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to understand that the lady claims, on the strength of the\r\ncircumstances which you have mentioned to me, to be your friend\xe2\x80\x99s wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey made an affirmative reply. The readiest means of obtaining Sir\r\nPatrick\xe2\x80\x99s opinion was, in this case, to answer, Yes. In other words,\r\nto represent Anne (in the character of \xe2\x80\x9cthe lady\xe2\x80\x9d) as claiming to be\r\nmarried to Arnold (in the character of \xe2\x80\x9chis friend\xe2\x80\x9d).\r\n\r\nHaving made this concession to circumstances, he was, at the same time,\r\nquite cunning enough to see that it was of vital importance to the\r\npurpose which he had in view, to confine himself strictly to this one\r\nperversion of the truth. There could be plainly no depending on the\r\nlawyer\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, unless that opinion was given on the facts exactly a\r\ns they had occurred at the inn. To the facts he had, thus far, carefully\r\nadhered; and to the facts (with the one inevitable departure from them\r\nwhich had been just forced on him) he determined to adhere to the end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid no letters pass between the lady and gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Sir\r\nPatrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone that I know of,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Geoffrey, steadily returning to the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done, Mr. Delamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? and what\xe2\x80\x99s your opinion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore I give my opinion I am bound to preface it by a personal\r\nstatement which you are not to take, if you please, as a statement of\r\nthe law. You ask me to decide--on the facts with which you have supplied\r\nme--whether your friend is, according to the law of Scotland, married or\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy experience, Mr. Delamayn, is that any single man, in Scotland, may\r\nmarry any single woman, at any time, and under any circumstances. In\r\nshort, after thirty years\xe2\x80\x99 practice as a lawyer, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is\r\n_not_ a marriage in Scotland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn plain English,\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey, \xe2\x80\x9cyou mean she\xe2\x80\x99s his wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn spite of his cunning; in spite of his self-command, his eyes\r\nbrightened as he said those words. And the tone in which he\r\nspoke--though too carefully guarded to be a tone of triumph--was, to a\r\nfine ear, unmistakably a tone of relief.\r\n\r\nNeither the look nor the tone was lost on Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\nHis first suspicion, when he sat down to the conference, had been\r\nthe obvious suspicion that, in speaking of \xe2\x80\x9chis friend,\xe2\x80\x9d Geoffrey was\r\nspeaking of himself. But, like all lawyers, he habitually distrusted\r\nfirst impressions, his own included. His object, thus far, had been\r\nto solve the problem of Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s true position and Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s real\r\nmotive. He had set the snare accordingly, and had caught his bird.\r\n\r\nIt was now plain to his mind--first, that this man who was consulting\r\nhim, was, in all probability, really speaking of the case of another\r\nperson: secondly, that he had an interest (of what nature it was\r\nimpossible yet to say) in satisfying his own mind that \xe2\x80\x9chis friend\xe2\x80\x9d was,\r\nby the law of Scotland, indisputably a married man. Having penetrated\r\nto that extent the secret which Geoffrey was concealing from him,\r\nhe abandoned the hope of making any further advance at that present\r\nsitting. The next question to clear up in the investigation, was the\r\nquestion of who the anonymous \xe2\x80\x9clady\xe2\x80\x9d might be. And the next discovery\r\nto make was, whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe lady\xe2\x80\x9d could, or could not, be identified with\r\nAnne Silvester. Pending the inevitable delay in reaching that result,\r\nthe straight course was (in Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s present state of uncertainty)\r\nthe only course to follow in laying down the law. He at once took the\r\nquestion of the marriage in hand--with no concealment whatever, as to\r\nthe legal bearings of it, from the client who was consulting him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t rush to conclusions, Mr. Delamayn,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have only told\r\nyou what my general experience is thus far. My professional opinion on\r\nthe special case of your friend has not been given yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s face clouded again. Sir Patrick carefully noted the new\r\nchange in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe law of Scotland,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cso far as it relates to Irregular\r\nMarriages, is an outrage on common decency and common-sense. If you\r\nthink my language in thus describing it too strong--I can refer you\r\nto the language of a judicial authority. Lord Deas delivered a recent\r\njudgment of marriage in Scotland, from the bench, in these words:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Consent makes marriage. No form or ceremony, civil or religious; no\r\nnotice before, or publication after; no cohabitation, no writing, no\r\nwitnesses even, are essential to the constitution of this, the most\r\nimportant contract which two persons can enter into.\xe2\x80\x99--There is a Scotch\r\njudge\xe2\x80\x99s own statement of the law that he administers! Observe, at the\r\nsame time, if you please, that we make full legal provision in Scotland\r\nfor contracts affecting the sale of houses and lands, horses and dogs.\r\nThe only contract which we leave without safeguards or precautions of\r\nany sort is the contract that unites a man and a woman for life. As\r\nfor the authority of parents, and the innocence of children, our law\r\nrecognizes no claim on it either in the one case or in the other. A\r\ngirl of twelve and a boy of fourteen have nothing to do but to cross the\r\nBorder, and to be married--without the interposition of the slightest\r\ndelay or restraint, and without the slightest attempt to inform their\r\nparents on the part of the Scotch law. As to the marriages of men and\r\nwomen, even the mere interchange of consent which, as you have just\r\nheard, makes them man and wife, is not required to be directly proved:\r\nit may be proved by inference. And, more even than that, whatever the\r\nlaw for its consistency may presume, men and women are, in point of\r\nfact, held to be married in Scotland where consent has never been\r\ninterchanged, and where the parties do not even know that they are\r\nlegally held to be married persons. Are you sufficiently confused about\r\nthe law of Irregular Marriages in Scotland by this time, Mr. Delamayn?\r\nAnd have I said enough to justify the strong language I used when I\r\nundertook to describe it to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s that \xe2\x80\x98authority\xe2\x80\x99 you talked of just now?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Geoffrey.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I ask _him?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might find him flatly contradicted, if you did ask him by another\r\nauthority equally learned and equally eminent,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sir Patrick.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not joking--I am only stating facts. Have you heard of the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nCommission?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen listen to this. In March, \xe2\x80\x98sixty-five, the Queen appointed a\r\nCommission to inquire into the Marriage-Laws of the United Kingdom. The\r\nReport of that Commission is published in London; and is accessible to\r\nany body who chooses to pay the price of two or three shillings for\r\nit. One of the results of the inquiry was, the discovery that high\r\nauthorities were of entirely contrary opinions on one of the vital\r\nquestions of Scottish marriage-law. And the Commissioners, in announcing\r\nthat fact, add that the question of which opinion is right is still\r\ndisputed, and has never been made the subject of legal decision.\r\nAuthorities are every where at variance throughout the Report. A haze of\r\ndoubt and uncertainty hangs in Scotland over the most important contract\r\nof civilized life. If no other reason existed for reforming the Scotch\r\nmarriage-law, there would be reason enough afforded by that one fact. An\r\nuncertain marriage-law is a national calamity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can tell me what you think yourself about my friend\xe2\x80\x99s case--can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey, still holding obstinately to the end that he had in\r\nview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. Now that I have given you due warning of the danger of\r\nimplicitly relying on any individual opinion, I may give my opinion with\r\na clear conscience. I say that there has not been a positive marriage in\r\nthis case. There has been evidence in favor of possibly establishing a\r\nmarriage--nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe distinction here was far too fine to be appreciated by Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind. He frowned heavily, in bewilderment and disgust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot married!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen they said they were man and wife,\r\nbefore witnesses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a common popular error,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I have already\r\ntold you, witnesses are not legally necessary to make a marriage in\r\nScotland. They are only valuable--as in this case--to help, at some\r\nfuture time, in proving a marriage that is in dispute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey caught at the last words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe landlady and the waiter _might_ make it out to be a marriage,\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And, remember, if you choose to apply to one of my professional\r\ncolleagues, he might possibly tell you they were married already. A\r\nstate of the law which allows the interchange of matrimonial consent\r\nto be proved by inference leaves a wide door open to conjecture. Your\r\nfriend refers to a certain lady, in so many words, as his wife. The lady\r\nrefers to your friend, in so many words, as her husband. In the rooms\r\nwhich they have taken, as man and wife, they remain, as man and wife,\r\ntill the next morning. Your friend goes away, without undeceiving any\r\nbody. The lady stays at the inn, for some days after, in the character\r\nof his wife. And all these circumstances take place in the presence o f\r\ncompetent witnesses. Logically--if not legally--there is apparently an\r\ninference of the interchange of matrimonial consent here. I stick to\r\nmy own opinion, nevertheless. Evidence in proof of a marriage (I\r\nsay)--nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Sir Patrick had been speaking, Geoffrey had been considering with\r\nhimself. By dint of hard thinking he had found his way to a decisive\r\nquestion on his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, dropping his heavy hand down on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cI want\r\nto bring you to book, Sir! Suppose my friend had another lady in his\r\neye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs things are now--would you advise him to marry her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs things are now--certainly not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey got briskly on his legs, and closed the interview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor him and for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words he walked back, without ceremony, into the main\r\nthoroughfare of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know who your friend is,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Sir Patrick, looking after\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if your interest in the question of his marriage is an honest\r\nand a harmless interest, I know no more of human nature than the babe\r\nunborn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nImmediately on leaving Sir Patrick, Geoffrey was encountered by one of\r\nthe servants in search of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d began the man. \xe2\x80\x9cThe groom from the Honorable\r\nMr. Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes? The fellow who brought me a note from my brother this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s expected back, Sir--he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid he mustn\xe2\x80\x99t wait any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the answer for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led the way to the writing-table, and referred to Julius\xe2\x80\x99s letter\r\nagain. He ran his eye carelessly over it, until he reached the final\r\nlines: \xe2\x80\x9cCome to-morrow, and help us to receive Mrs. Glenarm.\xe2\x80\x9d For a\r\nwhile he paused, with his eye fixed on that sentence; and with the\r\nhappiness of three people--of Anne, who had loved him; of Arnold, who\r\nhad served him; of Blanche, guiltless of injuring him--resting on the\r\ndecision that guided his movements for the next day. After what had\r\npassed that morning between Arnold and Blanche, if he remained at Lady\r\nLundie\xe2\x80\x99s, he had no alternative but to perform his promise to Anne. If\r\nhe returned to his brother\xe2\x80\x99s house, he had no alternative but to desert\r\nAnne, on the infamous pretext that she was Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly tossed the letter away from him on the table, and snatched\r\na sheet of note-paper out of the writing-case. \xe2\x80\x9cHere goes for Mrs.\r\nGlenarm!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself; and wrote back to his brother, in\r\none line: \xe2\x80\x9cDear Julius, Expect me to-morrow. G. D.\xe2\x80\x9d The impassible\r\nman-servant stood by while he wrote, looking at his magnificent breadth\r\nof chest, and thinking what a glorious \xe2\x80\x9cstaying-power\xe2\x80\x9d was there for the\r\nlast terrible mile of the coming race.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you are!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and handed his note to the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Geoffrey?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a friendly voice behind him.\r\n\r\nHe turned--and saw Arnold, anxious for news of the consultation with Sir\r\nPatrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     ------------ NOTE.--There are certain readers who feel a\r\n     disposition to doubt Facts, when they meet with them in a work of\r\n     fiction. Persons of this way of thinking may be profitably\r\n     referred to the book which first suggested to me the idea of\r\n     writing the present Novel. The book is the Report of the Royal\r\n     Commissioners on The Laws of Marriage. Published by the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n     Printers For her Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s Stationery Office. (London, 1868.)\r\n     What Sir Patrick says professionally of Scotch Marriages in this\r\n     chapter is taken from this high authority. What the lawyer (in\r\n     the Prologue) says professionally of Irish Marriages is also\r\n     derived from the same source. It is needless to encumber these\r\n     pages with quotations. But as a means of satisfying my readers\r\n     that they may depend on me, I subjoin an extract from my list of\r\n     references to the Report of the Marriage Commission, which any\r\n     persons who may be so inclined can verify for themselves.\r\n\r\n     _Irish Marriages_ (In the Prologue).--See Report, pages XII.,\r\n     XIII., XXIV.\r\n\r\n     _Irregular Marriages in Scotland._--Statement of the law by Lord\r\n     Deas.

In spite of the arguments\r\n     advanced before them in favor of not interfering with Irregular\r\n     Marriages in Scotland, the Commissioners declare their opinion\r\n     that \xe2\x80\x9cSuch marriages ought not to continue.\xe2\x80\x9d (Report, page\r\n     XXXIV.)\r\n\r\n     In reference to the arguments (alluded to above) in favor of\r\n     allowing the present disgraceful state of things to continue, I\r\n     find them resting mainly on these grounds: That Scotland doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n     like being interfered with by England (!). That Irregular\r\n     Marriages cost nothing (!!). That they are diminishing in number,\r\n     and may therefore be trusted, in course of time, to exhaust\r\n     themselves (!!!). That they act, on certain occasions, in the\r\n     capacity of a moral trap to catch a profligate man (!!!!). Such\r\n     is the elevated point of view from which the Institution of\r\n     Marriage is regarded by some of the most pious and learned men in\r\n     Scotland. A legal enactment providing for the sale of your wife,\r\n     when you have done with her, or of your husband; when you \xe2\x80\x9creally\r\n     can\xe2\x80\x99t put up with him any longer,\xe2\x80\x9d appears to be all that is\r\n     wanting to render this North British estimate of the \xe2\x80\x9cEstate of\r\n     Matrimony\xe2\x80\x9d practically complete. It is only fair to add that, of\r\n     the witnesses giving evidence--oral and written--before the\r\n     Commissioners, fully one-half regard the Irregular Marriages of\r\n     Scotland from the Christian and the civilized point of view, and\r\n     entirely agree with the authoritative conclusion already\r\n     cited--that such marriages ought to be abolished.\r\n\r\n     W. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIRST.\r\n\r\nDONE!\r\n\r\nARNOLD was a little surprised by the curt manner in which Geoffrey\r\nanswered him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Sir Patrick said any thing unpleasant?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick has said just what I wanted him to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo difficulty about the marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo fear of Blanche--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe won\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to go to Craig Fernie--I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer for that!\xe2\x80\x9d He said\r\nthe words with a strong emphasis on them, took his brother\xe2\x80\x99s letter from\r\nthe table, snatched up his hat, and went out.\r\n\r\nHis friends, idling on the lawn, hailed him. He passed by them quickly\r\nwithout answering, without so much as a glance at them over his\r\nshoulder. Arriving at the rose-garden, he stopped and took out his pipe;\r\nthen suddenly changed his mind, and turned back again by another path.\r\nThere was no certainty, at that hour of the day, of his being left alone\r\nin the rose-garden. He had a fierce and hungry longing to be by himself;\r\nhe felt as if he could have been the death of any body who came and\r\nspoke to him at that moment. With his head down and his brows knit\r\nheavily, he followed the path to see what it ended in. It ended in a\r\nwicket-gate which led into a kitchen-garden. Here he was well out of\r\nthe way of interruption: there was nothing to attract visitors in the\r\nkitchen-garden. He went on to a walnut-tree planted in the middle of the\r\ninclosure, with a wooden bench and a broad strip of turf running round\r\nit. After first looking about him, he seated himself and lit his pipe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish it was done!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nHe sat, with his elbows on his knees, smoking and thinking. Before long\r\nthe restlessness that had got possession of him forced him to his feet\r\nagain. He rose, and paced round and round the strip of greensward under\r\nthe walnut-tree, like a wild beast in a cage.\r\n\r\nWhat was the meaning of this disturbance in the inner man? Now that he\r\nhad committed himself to the betrayal of the friend who had trusted and\r\nserved him, was he torn by remorse?\r\n\r\nHe was no more torn by remorse than you are while your eye is passing\r\nover this sentence. He was simply in a raging fever of impatience to see\r\nhimself safely la nded at the end which he had in view.\r\n\r\nWhy should he feel remorse? All remorse springs, more or less directly,\r\nfrom the action of two sentiments, which are neither of them inbred in\r\nthe natural man. The first of these sentiments is the product of the\r\nrespect which we learn to feel for ourselves. The second is the product\r\nof the respect which we learn to feel for others. In their highest\r\nmanifestations, these two feelings exalt themselves, until the first he\r\ncomes the love of God, and the second the love of Man. I have injured\r\nyou, and I repent of it when it is done. Why should I repent of it if\r\nI have gained something by it for my own self and if you can\xe2\x80\x99t make me\r\nfeel it by injuring Me? I repent of it because there has been a sense\r\nput into me which tells me that I have sinned against Myself, and sinned\r\nagainst You. No such sense as that exists among the instincts of the\r\nnatural man. And no such feelings as these troubled Geoffrey Delamayn;\r\nfor Geoffrey Delamayn was the natural man.\r\n\r\nWhen the idea of his scheme had sprung to life in his mind, the\r\nnovelty of it had startled him--the enormous daring of it, suddenly\r\nself-revealed, had daunted him. The signs of emotion which he had\r\nbetrayed at the writing-table in the library were the signs of mere\r\nmental perturbation, and of nothing more.\r\n\r\nThat first vivid impression past, the idea had made itself familiar\r\nto him. He had become composed enough to see such difficulties as it\r\ninvolved, and such consequences as it implied. These had fretted him\r\nwith a passing trouble; for these he plainly discerned. As for the\r\ncruelty and the treachery of the thing he meditated doing--that\r\nconsideration never crossed the limits of his mental view. His position\r\ntoward the man whose life he had preserved was the position of a dog.\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cnoble animal\xe2\x80\x9d who has saved you or me from drowning will fly at\r\nyour throat or mine, under certain conditions, ten minutes afterward.\r\nAdd to the dog\xe2\x80\x99s unreasoning instinct the calculating cunning of a man;\r\nsuppose yourself to be in a position to say of some trifling thing,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurious! at such and such a time I happened to pick up such and such\r\nan object; and now it turns out to be of some use to me!\xe2\x80\x9d--and there you\r\nhave an index to the state of Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s feeling toward his friend when\r\nhe recalled the past or when he contemplated the future. When Arnold\r\nhad spoken to him at the critical moment, Arnold had violently irritated\r\nhim; and that was all.\r\n\r\nThe same impenetrable insensibility, the same primitively natural\r\ncondition of the moral being, prevented him from being troubled by the\r\nslightest sense of pity for Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s out of my way!\xe2\x80\x9d was his first\r\nthought. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s provided for, without any trouble to Me!\xe2\x80\x9d was his second.\r\nHe was not in the least uneasy about her. Not the slightest doubt\r\ncrossed his mind that, when once she had realized her own situation,\r\nwhen once she saw herself placed between the two alternatives of facing\r\nher own ruin or of claiming Arnold as a last resource, she would claim\r\nArnold. She would do it as a matter of course; because _he_ would have\r\ndone it in her place.\r\n\r\nBut he wanted it over. He was wild, as he paced round and round the\r\nwalnut-tree, to hurry on the crisis and be done with it. Give me my\r\nfreedom to go to the other woman, and to train for the foot-race--that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat I want. _They_ injured? Confusion to them both! It\xe2\x80\x99s I who am\r\ninjured by them. They are the worst enemies I have! They stand in my\r\nway.\r\n\r\nHow to be rid of them? There was the difficulty. He had made up his mind\r\nto be rid of them that day. How was he to begin?\r\n\r\nThere was no picking a quarrel with Arnold, and so beginning with _him._\r\nThis course of proceeding, in Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s position toward Blanche, would\r\nlead to a scandal at the outset--a scandal which would stand in the way\r\nof his making the right impression on Mrs. Glenarm. The woman--lonely\r\nand friendless, with her sex and her position both against her if _she_\r\ntried to make a scandal of it--the woman was the one to begin with.\r\nSettle it at once and forever with Anne; and leave Arnold to hear of it\r\nand deal with it, sooner or later, no matter which.\r\n\r\nHow was he to break it to her before the day was out?\r\n\r\nBy going to the inn and openly addressing her to her face as Mrs. Arnold\r\nBrinkworth? No! He had had enough, at Windygates, of meeting her face\r\nto face. The easy way was to write to her, and send the letter, by the\r\nfirst messenger he could find, to the inn. She might appear afterward at\r\nWindygates; she might follow him to his brother\xe2\x80\x99s; she might appeal to\r\nhis father. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter; he had got the whip-hand of her now. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nare a married woman.\xe2\x80\x9d There was the one sufficient answer, which was\r\nstrong enough to back him in denying any thing!\r\n\r\nHe made out the letter in his own mind. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething like this would do,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he thought, as he went round and round the walnut-tree: \xe2\x80\x9cYou may be\r\nsurprised not to have seen me. You have only yourself to thank for it.\r\nI know what took place between you and him at the inn. I have had a\r\nlawyer\xe2\x80\x99s advice. You are Arnold Brinkworth\xe2\x80\x99s wife. I wish you joy, and\r\ngood-by forever.\xe2\x80\x9d Address those lines: \xe2\x80\x9cTo Mrs. Arnold Brinkworth;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n instruct the messenger to leave the letter late that night, without\r\nwaiting for an answer; start the first thing the next morning for his\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s house; and behold, it was done!\r\n\r\nBut even here there was an obstacle--one last exasperating\r\nobstacle--still in the way.\r\n\r\nIf she was known at the inn by any name at all, it was by the name of\r\nMrs. Silvester. A letter addressed to \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Arnold Brinkworth\xe2\x80\x9d would\r\nprobably not be taken in at the door; or if it was admitted and if\r\nit was actually offered to her, she might decline to receive it, as a\r\nletter not addressed to herself. A man of readier mental resources would\r\nhave seen that the name on the outside of the letter mattered little or\r\nnothing, so long as the contents were read by the person to whom they\r\nwere addressed. But Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s was the order of mind which expresses\r\ndisturbance by attaching importance to trifles. He attached an absurd\r\nimportance to preserving absolute consistency in his letter, outside and\r\nin. If he declared her to be Arnold Brinkworth\xe2\x80\x99s wife, he must direct\r\nto her as Arnold Brinkworth\xe2\x80\x99s wife; or who could tell what the law might\r\nsay, or what scrape he might not get himself into by a mere scratch of\r\nthe pen! The more he thought of it, the more persuaded he felt of his\r\nown cleverness here, and the hotter and the angrier he grew.\r\n\r\nThere is a way out of every thing. And there was surely a way out of\r\nthis, if he could only see it.\r\n\r\nHe failed to see it. After dealing with all the great difficulties, the\r\nsmall difficulty proved too much for him. It struck him that he might\r\nhave been thinking too long about it--considering that he was not\r\naccustomed to thinking long about any thing. Besides, his head was\r\ngetting giddy, with going mechanically round and round the tree. He\r\nirritably turned his back on the tree and struck into another path:\r\nresolved to think of something else, and then to return to his\r\ndifficulty, and see it with a new eye.\r\n\r\nLeaving his thoughts free to wander where they liked, his thoughts\r\nnaturally busied themselves with the next subject that was uppermost\r\nin his mind, the subject of the Foot-Race. In a week\xe2\x80\x99s time his\r\narrangements ought to be made. Now, as to the training, first.\r\n\r\nHe decided on employing two trainers this time. One to travel to\r\nScotland, and begin with him at his brother\xe2\x80\x99s house. The other to take\r\nhim up, with a fresh eye to him, on his return to London. He turned over\r\nin his mind the performances of the formidable rival against whom he was\r\nto be matched. That other man was the swiftest runner of the two.\r\nThe betting in Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s favor was betting which calculated on the\r\nunparalleled length of the race, and on Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s prodigious powers of\r\nendurance. How long he should \xe2\x80\x9cwait on\xe2\x80\x9d the man? Whereabouts it would\r\nbe safe to \xe2\x80\x9cpick the man up?\xe2\x80\x9d How near the end to calculate the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexhaustion to a nicety, and \xe2\x80\x9cput on the spurt,\xe2\x80\x9d and pass him? These were\r\nnice points to decide. The deliberations of a pedestrian-privy-council\r\nwould be required to help him under this heavy responsibility. What men\r\ncould he trust? He could trust A. and B.--both of them authorities:\r\nboth of them stanch. Query about C.? As an authority, unexceptionable;\r\nas a man, doubtful. The problem relating to C. brought him to a\r\nstandstill--and declined to be solved, even then. Never mind! he could\r\nalways take the advice of A. and B. In the mean time devote C. to the\r\ninfernal regions; and, thus dismissing him, try and think of something\r\nelse. What else? Mrs. Glenarm? Oh, bother the women! one of them is the\r\nsame as another. They all waddle when they run; and they all fill their\r\nstomachs before dinner with sloppy tea. That\xe2\x80\x99s the only difference\r\nbetween women and men--the rest is nothing but a weak imitation of Us.\r\nDevote the women to the infernal regions; and, so dismissing _them,_ try\r\nand think of something else. Of what? Of something worth thinking of,\r\nthis time--of filling another pipe.\r\n\r\nHe took out his tobacco-pouch; and suddenly suspended operations at the\r\nmoment of opening it.\r\n\r\nWhat was the object he saw, on the other side of a row of dwarf\r\npear-trees, away to the right? A woman--evidently a servant by her\r\ndress--stooping down with her back to him, gathering something: herbs\r\nthey looked like, as well as he could make them out at the distance.\r\n\r\nWhat was that thing hanging by a string at the woman\xe2\x80\x99s side? A slate?\r\nYes. What the deuce did she want with a slate at her side? He was in\r\nsearch of something to divert his mind--and here it was found. \xe2\x80\x9cAny\r\nthing will do for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I \xe2\x80\x98chaff\xe2\x80\x99 her a little about\r\nher slate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe called to the woman across the pear-trees. \xe2\x80\x9cHullo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman raised herself, and advanced toward him slowly--looking at\r\nhim, as she came on, with the sunken eyes, the sorrow-stricken face, the\r\nstony tranquillity of Hester Dethridge.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey was staggered. He had not bargained for exchanging the dullest\r\nproducible vulgarities of human speech (called in the language of slang,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChaff\xe2\x80\x9d) with such a woman as this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that slate for?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, not knowing what else to say, to\r\nbegin with.\r\n\r\nThe woman lifted her hand to her lips--touched them--and shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDumb?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman bowed her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman wrote on her slate, and handed it to him over the pear-trees.\r\nHe read:--\xe2\x80\x9cI am the cook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, cook, were you born dumb?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat struck you dumb?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman wrote on her slate:--\xe2\x80\x9cA blow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho gave you the blow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head again.\r\n\r\nHer eyes had rested on his face while he was questioning her; staring\r\nat him, cold, dull, and changeless as the eyes of a corpse. Firm as his\r\nnerves were--dense as he was, on all ordinary occasions, to any thing in\r\nthe shape of an imaginative impression--the eyes of the dumb cook slowly\r\npenetrated him with a stealthy inner chill. Something crept at the\r\nmarrow of his back, and shuddered under the roots of his hair. He felt\r\na sudden impulse to get away from her. It was simple enough; he had only\r\nto say good-morning, and go on. He did say good-morning--but he never\r\nmoved. He put his hand into his pocket, and offered her some money, as a\r\nway of making _her_ go. She stretched out her hand across the pear-trees\r\nto take it--and stopped abruptly, with her arm suspended in the air. A\r\nsinister change passed over the deathlike tranquillity of her face. Her\r\nclosed lips slowly dropped apart. Her dull eyes slowly dilated; looked\r\naway, sideways, from _his_ eyes; stopped again; and stared, rigid and\r\nglittering, over his shoulder--stared as if they saw a sight of horror\r\nbehind him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil are you looking at?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked--and turned\r\nround quickly, with a start. There was neither person nor thing to be\r\nseen behind him. He turned back again to the woman. The woman had left\r\nhim, under the influence of some sudden panic. She was hurrying away\r\nfrom him--running, old as she was--flying the sight of him, as if the\r\nsight of him was the pestilence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMad!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought--and turned his back on the sight of her.\r\n\r\nHe found himself (hardly knowing how he had got there) under the\r\nwalnut-tree once more. In a few minutes his hardy nerves had recovered\r\nthemselves--he could laugh over the remembrance of the strange\r\nimpression that had been produced on him. \xe2\x80\x9cFrightened for the first time\r\nin my life,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought--\xe2\x80\x9cand that by an old woman! It\xe2\x80\x99s time I went\r\ninto training again, when things have come to this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch. It was close on the luncheon hour up at the\r\nhouse; and he had not decided yet what to do about his letter to Anne.\r\nHe resolved to decide, then and there.\r\n\r\nThe woman--the dumb woman, with the stony face and the horrid\r\neyes--reappeared in his thoughts, and got in the way of his decision.\r\nPooh! some crazed old servant, who might once have been cook; who was\r\nkept out of charity now. Nothing more important than that. No more of\r\nher! no more of her!\r\n\r\nHe laid himself down on the grass, and gave his mind to the serious\r\nquestion. How to address Anne as \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Arnold Brinkworth?\xe2\x80\x9d and how to\r\nmake sure of her receiving the letter?\r\n\r\nThe dumb old woman got in his way again.\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes impatiently, and tried to shut her out in a darkness\r\nof his own making.\r\n\r\nThe woman showed herself through the darkness. He saw her, as if he\r\nhad just asked her a question, writing on her slate. What she wrote he\r\nfailed to make out. It was all over in an instant. He started up, with\r\na feeling of astonishment at himself--and, at the same moment his brain\r\ncleared with the suddenness of a flash of light. He saw his way, without\r\na conscious effort on his own part, through the difficulty that had\r\ntroubled him. Two envelopes, of course: an inner one, unsealed, and\r\naddressed to \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Arnold Brinkworth;\xe2\x80\x9d an outer one, sealed, and\r\naddressed to \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Silvester:\xe2\x80\x9d and there was the problem solved! Surely\r\nthe simplest problem that had ever puzzled a stupid head.\r\n\r\nWhy had he not seen it before? Impossible to say.\r\n\r\nHow came he to have seen it now?\r\n\r\nThe dumb old woman reappeared in his thoughts--as if the answer to the\r\nquestion lay in something connected with _her._\r\n\r\nHe became alarmed about himself, for the first time in his life. Had\r\nthis persistent impression, produced by nothing but a crazy old woman,\r\nany thing to do with the broken health which the surgeon had talked\r\nabout? Was his head on the turn? Or had he smoked too much on an empty\r\nstomach, and gone too long (after traveling all night) without his\r\ncustomary drink of ale?\r\n\r\nHe left the garden to put that latter theory to the test forthwith. The\r\nbetting would have gone dead against him if the public had seen him at\r\nthat moment. He looked haggard and anxious--and with good reason too.\r\nHis nervous system had suddenly forced itself on his notice, without the\r\nslightest previous introduction, and was saying (in an unknown tongue),\r\nHere I am!\r\n\r\nReturning to the purely ornamental part of the grounds, Geoffrey\r\nencountered one of the footmen giving a message to one of the gardeners.\r\nHe at once asked for the butler--as the only safe authority to consult\r\nin the present emergency.\r\n\r\nConducted to the butler\xe2\x80\x99s pantry, Geoffrey requested that functionary to\r\nproduce a jug of his oldest ale, with appropriate solid nourishment in\r\nthe shape of \xe2\x80\x9ca hunk of bread and cheese.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe butler stared. As a form of condescension among the upper classes\r\nthis was quite new to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuncheon will be ready directly, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there for lunch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe butler ran over an appetizing list of good dishes and rare wines.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil take your kickshaws!\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me my old ale, and\r\nmy hunk of bread and cheese.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere will you take them, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, to be sure! And the sooner the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe butler issued the necessary orders with all needful alacrity. He\r\nspread the simple refreshment demanded, before his distinguished guest,\r\nin a state of blank bewilderment. Here was a nobleman\xe2\x80\x99s son, and a\r\npublic celebrity into the bargain, filling himself with bread and cheese\r\nand ale, in at once the most voracious and the most unpretending\r\nmanner, at _his_ table! The butler ventured on a little complimentary\r\nfamiliarity. He smiled, and touched the betting-book in his\r\nbreast-pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve put six pound on you, Sir, for the Race.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAll\r\nright, old boy! you shall win your money!\xe2\x80\x9d With those noble words the\r\nhonorable gentleman clapped him on the back, and held out his tumbler\r\nfor some more ale. The butler felt trebly an Englishman as he filled the\r\nfoaming glass. Ah! foreign nations may have their revolutions! foreign\r\naristocracies may tumble down! The British aristocracy lives in the\r\nhearts of the people, and lives forever!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother!\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey, presenting his empty glass. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s luck!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ntossed off his liquor at a draught, and nodded to the butler, and went\r\nout.\r\n\r\nHad the experiment succeeded? Had he proved his own theory about himself\r\nto be right? Not a doubt of it! An empty stomach, and a determination of\r\ntobacco to the head--these were the true causes of that strange state of\r\nmind into which he had fallen in the kitchen-garden. The dumb woman\r\nwith the stony face vanished as if in a mist. He felt nothing now but\r\na comfortable buzzing in his head, a genial warmth all over him, and an\r\nunlimited capacity for carrying any responsibility that could rest on\r\nmortal shoulders. Geoffrey was himself again.\r\n\r\nHe went round toward the library, to write his letter to Anne--and so\r\nhave done with that, to begin with. The company had collected in the\r\nlibrary waiting for the luncheon-bell. All were idly talking; and some\r\nwould be certain, if he showed himself, to fasten on _him._ He turned\r\nback again, without showing himself. The only way of writing in peace\r\nand quietness would be to wait until they were all at luncheon, and then\r\nreturn to the library. The same opportunity would serve also for finding\r\na messenger to take the letter, without exciting attention, and for\r\ngoing away afterward, unseen, on a long walk by himself. An absence of\r\ntwo or three hours would cast the necessary dust in Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s eyes;\r\nfor it would be certainly interpreted by him as meaning absence at an\r\ninterview with Anne.\r\n\r\nHe strolled idly through the grounds, farther and farther away from the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe talk in the library--aimless and empty enough, for the most\r\npart--was talk to the purpose, in one corner of the room, in which Sir\r\nPatrick and Blanche were sitting together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle! I have been watching you for the last minute or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt my age, Blanche? that is paying me a very pretty compliment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what I have seen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have seen an old gentleman in want of his lunch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen an old gentleman with something on his mind. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppressed gout, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat won\xe2\x80\x99t do! I am not to be put off in that way. Uncle! I want to\r\nknow--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop there, Blanche! A young lady who says she \xe2\x80\x98wants to know,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nexpresses very dangerous sentiments. Eve \xe2\x80\x98wanted to know\xe2\x80\x99--and see what\r\nit led to. Faust \xe2\x80\x98wanted to know\xe2\x80\x99--and got into bad company, as the\r\nnecessary result.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are feeling anxious about something,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\r\nwhat is more, Sir Patrick, you behaved in a most unaccountable manner a\r\nlittle while since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you went and hid yourself with Mr. Delamayn in that snug corner\r\nthere. I saw you lead the way in, while I was at work on Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nodious dinner-invitations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you call that being at work, do you? I wonder whether there was\r\never a woman yet who could give the whole of her mind to any earthly\r\nthing that she had to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind the women! What subject in common could you and Mr. Delamayn\r\npossibly have to talk about? And why do I see a wrinkle between your\r\neyebrows, now you have done with him?--a wrinkle which certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthere before you had that private conference together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore answering, Sir Patrick considered whether he should take Blanche\r\ninto his confidence or not. The attempt to identify Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s unnamed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clady,\xe2\x80\x9d which he was determined to make, would lead him to Craig Fernie,\r\nand would no doubt end in obliging him to address himself to Anne.\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s intimate knowledge of her friend might unquestionably be made\r\nuseful to him under these circumstances; and Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s discretion was\r\nto be trusted in any matter in which Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s interests were\r\nconcerned. On the other hand, caution was imperatively necessary, in\r\nthe present imperfect state of his information--and caution, in Sir\r\nPatrick\xe2\x80\x99s mind, carried the day. He decided to wait and see what came\r\nfirst of his investigation at the inn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Delamayn consulted me on a dry point of law, in which a friend of\r\nhis was interested,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have wasted your curiosity,\r\nmy dear, on a subject totally unworthy of a lady\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s penetration was not to be deceived on such easy terms as\r\nthese. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not say at once that you won\xe2\x80\x99t tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d she rejoined.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ shutting yourself up with Mr. Delamayn to talk law! _You_ looking\r\nabsent and anxious about it afterward! I am a very unhappy girl!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nBlanche, with a little, bitter sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is something in me that\r\nseems to repel the people I love. Not a word in confidence can I get\r\nfrom Anne. And not a word in confidence can I get from you. And I do so\r\nlong to sympathize! It\xe2\x80\x99s very hard. I think I shall go to Arnold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick took his niece\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a minute, Blanche. About Miss Silvester? Have you heard from her\r\nto-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I am more unhappy about her than words can say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose somebody went to Craig Fernie and tried to find out the cause\r\nof Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s silence? Would you believe that somebody sympathized\r\nwith you then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s face flushed brightly with pleasure and surprise. She raised\r\nSir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s hand gratefully to her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that _you_ would do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am certainly the last person who ought to do it--seeing that you went\r\nto the inn in flat rebellion against my orders, and that I only forgave\r\nyou, on your own promise of amendment, the other day. It is a miserably\r\nweak proceeding on the part of \xe2\x80\x98the head of the family\xe2\x80\x99 to be turning\r\nhis back on his own principles, because his niece happens to be anxious\r\nand unhappy. Still (if you could lend me your little carriage), I\r\n_might_ take a surly drive toward Craig Fernie, all by myself, and I\r\n_might_ stumble against Miss Silvester--in case you have any thing to\r\nsay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny thing to say?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Blanche. She put her arm round her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneck, and whispered in his ear one of the most interminable messages\r\nthat ever was sent from one human being to another. Sir Patrick\r\nlistened, with a growing interest in the inquiry on which he was\r\nsecretly bent. \xe2\x80\x9cThe woman must have some noble qualities,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwho can inspire such devotion as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Blanche was whispering to her uncle, a second private\r\nconference--of the purely domestic sort--was taking place between Lady\r\nLundie and the butler, in the hall outside the library door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to say, my lady, Hester Dethridge has broken out again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was all right, my lady, when she went into the kitchen-garden, some\r\ntime since. She\xe2\x80\x99s taken strange again, now she has come back. Wants the\r\nrest of the day to herself, your ladyship. Says she\xe2\x80\x99s overworked, with\r\nall the company in the house--and, I must say, does look like a person\r\ntroubled and worn out in body and mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk nonsense, Roberts! The woman is obstinate and idle and\r\ninsolent. She is now in the house, as you know, under a month\xe2\x80\x99s notice\r\nto leave. If she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t choose to do her duty for that month I shall\r\nrefuse to give her a character. Who is to cook the dinner to-day if I\r\ngive Hester Dethridge leave to go out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny way, my lady, I am afraid the kitchen-maid will have to do her\r\nbest to-day. Hester is very obstinate, when the fit takes her--as your\r\nladyship says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Hester Dethridge leaves the kitchen-maid to cook the dinner,\r\nRoberts, Hester Dethridge leaves my service to-day. I want no more words\r\nabout it. If she persists in setting my orders at defiance, let her\r\nbring her account-book into the library, while we are at lunch, and lay\r\nit out my desk. I shall be back in the library after luncheon--and if I\r\nsee the account-book I shall know what it means. In that case, you will\r\nreceive my directions to settle with her and send her away. Ring the\r\nluncheon-bell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe luncheon-bell rang. The guests all took the direction of the dining\r\n-room; Sir Patrick following, from the far end of the library, with\r\nBlanche on his arm. Arrived at the dining-room door, Blanche stopped,\r\nand asked her uncle to excuse her if she left him to go in by himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will be back directly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have forgotten something up\r\nstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick went in. The dining-room door closed; and Blanche returned\r\nalone to the library. Now on one pretense, and now on another, she had,\r\nfor three days past, faithfully fulfilled the engagement she had made at\r\nCraig Fernie to wait ten minutes after luncheon-time in the library, on\r\nthe chance of seeing Anne. On this, the fourth occasion, the faithful\r\ngirl sat down alone in the great room, and waited with her eyes fixed on\r\nthe lawn outside.\r\n\r\nFive minutes passed, and nothing living appeared but the birds hopping\r\nabout the grass.\r\n\r\nIn less than a minute more Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s quick ear caught the faint sound of\r\na woman\xe2\x80\x99s dress brushing over the lawn. She ran to the nearest window,\r\nlooked out, and clapped her hands with a cry of delight. There was\r\nthe well-known figure, rapidly approaching her! Anne was true to their\r\nfriendship--Anne had kept her engagement at last!\r\n\r\nBlanche hurried out, and drew her into the library in triumph. \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\nmakes amends, love for every thing! You answer my letter in the best of\r\nall ways--you bring me your own dear self.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe placed Anne in a chair, and, lifting her veil, saw her plainly in\r\nthe brilliant mid-day light.\r\n\r\nThe change in the whole woman was nothing less than dreadful to the\r\nloving eyes that rested on her. She looked years older than her real\r\nage. There was a dull calm in her face, a stagnant, stupefied submission\r\nto any thing, pitiable to see. Three days and nights of solitude and\r\ngrief, three days and nights of unresting and unpartaken suspense, had\r\ncrushed that sensitive nature, had frozen that warm heart. The animating\r\nspirit was gone--the mere shell of the woman lived and moved, a mockery\r\nof her former self.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Anne! Anne! What _can_ have happened to you? Are you frightened?\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s not the least fear of any body disturbing us. They are all at\r\nluncheon, and the servants are at dinner. We have the room entirely to\r\nourselves. My darling! you look so faint and strange! Let me get you\r\nsomething.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne drew Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s head down and kissed her. It was done in a dull,\r\nslow way--without a word, without a tear, without a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re tired--I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re tired. Have you walked here? You sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo back on foot; I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne roused herself at those words. She spoke for the first time. The\r\ntone was lower than was natural to her; sadder than was natural to\r\nher--but the charm of her voice, the native gentleness and beauty of it,\r\nseemed to have survived the wreck of all besides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t go back, Blanche. I have left the inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeft the inn? With your husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered the first question--not the second.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t go back,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe inn is no place for me. A curse seems\r\nto follow me, Blanche, wherever I go. I am the cause of quarreling\r\nand wretchedness, without meaning it, God knows. The old man who is\r\nhead-waiter at the inn has been kind to me, my dear, in his way, and\r\nhe and the landlady had hard words together about it. A quarrel, a\r\nshocking, violent quarrel. He has lost his place in consequence. The\r\nwoman, his mistress, lays all the blame of it to my door. She is a hard\r\nwoman; and she has been harder than ever since Bishopriggs went away. I\r\nhave missed a letter at the inn--I must have thrown it aside, I suppose,\r\nand forgotten it. I only know that I remembered about it, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfind it last night. I told the landlady, and she fastened a quarrel on\r\nme almost before the words were out of my mouth. Asked me if I charged\r\nher with stealing my letter. Said things to me--I can\xe2\x80\x99t repeat them.\r\nI am not very well, and not able to deal with people of that sort. I\r\nthought it best to leave Craig Fernie this morning. I hope and pray I\r\nshall never see Craig Fernie again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe told her little story with a total absence of emotion of any sort,\r\nand laid her head back wearily on the chair when it was done.\r\n\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s eyes filled with tears at the sight of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t tease you with questions, Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gently. \xe2\x80\x9cCome up\r\nstairs and rest in my room. You\xe2\x80\x99re not fit to travel, love. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take\r\ncare that nobody comes near us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stable-clock at Windygates struck the quarter to two. Anne raised\r\nherself in the chair with a start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time was that?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nBlanche told her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stay,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have come here to find something out if I\r\ncan. You won\xe2\x80\x99t ask me questions? Don\xe2\x80\x99t, Blanche, don\xe2\x80\x99t! for the sake of\r\nold times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche turned aside, heart-sick. \xe2\x80\x9cI will do nothing, dear, to annoy\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and took Anne\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and hid the tears that were\r\nbeginning to fall over her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know something, Blanche. Will you tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are the gentlemen staying in the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche looked round at her again, in sudden astonishment and alarm.\r\nA vague fear seized her that Anne\xe2\x80\x99s mind had given way under the heavy\r\nweight of trouble laid on it. Anne persisted in pressing her strange\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRun over their names, Blanche. I have a reason for wishing to know who\r\nthe gentlemen are who are staying in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche repeated the names of Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s guests, leaving to the last\r\nthe guests who had arrived last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo more came back this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cArnold Brinkworth and\r\nthat hateful friend of his, Mr. Delamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s head sank back once more on the chair. She had found her way\r\nwithout exciting suspicion of the truth, to the one discovery which she\r\nhad come to Windygates to make. He was in Scotland again, and he had\r\nonly arrived from London that morning. There was barely time for him to\r\nhave communicated with Craig Fernie before she left the inn--he, too,\r\nwho hated letter-writing! The circumstances were all in his favor: there\r\nwas no reason, there was really and truly no reason, so far, to believe\r\nthat he had deserted her. The heart of the unhappy woman bounded in\r\nher bosom, under the first ray of hope that had warmed it for four days\r\npast. Under that sudden revulsion of feeling, her weakened frame shook\r\nfrom head to foot. Her face flushed deep for a moment--then turned\r\ndeadly pale again. Blanche, anxiously watching her, saw the serious\r\nnecessity for giving some restorative to her instantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to get you some wine--you will faint, Anne, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake something. I shall be back in a moment; and I can manage it without\r\nany body being the wiser.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pushed Anne\xe2\x80\x99s chair close to the nearest open window--a window at\r\nthe upper end of the library--and ran out.\r\n\r\nBlanche had barely left the room, by the door that led into the hall,\r\nwhen Geoffrey entered it by one of the lower windows opening from the\r\nlawn.\r\n\r\nWith his mind absorbed in the letter that he was about to write, he\r\nslowly advanced up the room toward the nearest table. Anne, hearing\r\nthe sound of footsteps, started, and looked round. Her failing strength\r\nrallied in an instant, under the sudden relief of seeing him again. She\r\nrose and advanced eagerly, with a faint tinge of color in her cheeks. He\r\nlooked up. The two stood face to face together--alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeoffrey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at her without answering--without advancing a step, on his\r\nside. There was an evil light in his eyes; his silence was the brute\r\nsilence that threatens dumbly. He had made up his mind never to see her\r\nagain, and she had entrapped him into an interview. He had made up his\r\nmind to write, and there she stood forcing him to speak. The sum of\r\nher offenses against him was now complete. If there had ever been the\r\nfaintest hope of her raising even a passing pity in his heart, that hope\r\nwould have been annihilated now.\r\n\r\nShe failed to understand the full meaning of his silence. She made her\r\nexcuses, poor soul, for venturing back to Windygates--her excuses to the\r\nman whose purpose at that moment was to throw her helpless on the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray forgive me for coming here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have done nothing to\r\ncompromise you, Geoffrey. Nobody but Blanche knows I am at Windygates.\r\nAnd I have contrived to make my inquiries about you without allowing\r\nher to suspect our secret.\xe2\x80\x9d She stopped, and began to tremble. She saw\r\nsomething more in his face than she had read in it at first. \xe2\x80\x9cI got your\r\nletter,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, rallying her sinking courage. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t complain\r\nof its being so short: you don\xe2\x80\x99t like letter-writing, I know. But you\r\npromised I should hear from you again. And I have never heard. And oh,\r\nGeoffrey, it was so lonely at the inn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped again, and supported herself by resting her hand on the\r\ntable. The faintness was stealing back on her. She tried to go on again.\r\nIt was useless--she could only look at him now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, in the tone of a man who was putting an\r\nunimportant question to a total stranger.\r\n\r\nA last gleam of her old energy flickered up in her face, like a dying\r\nflame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am broken by what I have gone through,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t insult me by\r\nmaking me remind you of your promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat promise?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor shame, Geoffrey! for shame! Your promise to marry me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou claim my promise after what you have done at the inn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe steadied herself against the table with one hand, and put the other\r\nhand to her head. Her brain was giddy. The effort to think was too much\r\nfor her. She said to herself, vacantly, \xe2\x80\x9cThe inn? What did I do at the\r\ninn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s advice, mind! I know what I am talking about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe appeared not to have heard him. She repeated the words, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did\r\nI do at the inn?\xe2\x80\x9d and gave it up in despair. Holding by the table, she\r\ncame close to him and laid her hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you refuse to marry me?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nHe saw the vile opportunity, and said the vile words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re married already to Arnold Brinkworth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout a cry to warn him, without an effort to save herself, she\r\ndropped senseless at his feet; as her mother had dropped at his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeet in the by-gone time.\r\n\r\nHe disentangled himself from the folds of her dress. \xe2\x80\x9cDone!\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nlooking down at her as she lay on the floor.\r\n\r\nAs the word fell from his lips he was startled by a sound in the inner\r\npart of the house. One of the library doors had not been completely\r\nclosed. Light footsteps were audible, advancing rapidly across the hall.\r\n\r\nHe turned and fled, leaving the library, as he had entered it, by the\r\nopen window at the lower end of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE TWENTY-SECOND.\r\n\r\nGONE.\r\n\r\nBLANCHE came in, with a glass of wine in her hand, and saw the swooning\r\nwoman on the floor.\r\n\r\nShe was alarmed, but not surprised, as she knelt by Anne, and raised her\r\nhead. Her own previous observation of her friend necessarily prevented\r\nher from being at any loss to account for the fainting fit. The\r\ninevitable delay in getting the wine was--naturally to her mind--alone\r\nto blame for the result which now met her view.\r\n\r\nIf she had been less ready in thus tracing the effect to the cause,\r\nshe might have gone to the window to see if any thing had happened,\r\nout-of-doors, to frighten Anne--might have seen Geoffrey before he had\r\ntime to turn the corner of the house--and, making that one discovery,\r\nmight have altered the whole course of events, not in her coming\r\nlife only, but in the coming lives of others. So do we shape our own\r\ndestinies, blindfold. So do we hold our poor little tenure of happiness\r\nat the capricious mercy of Chance. It is surely a blessed delusion which\r\npersuades us that we are the highest product of the great scheme of\r\ncreation, and sets us doubting whether other planets are inhabited,\r\nbecause other planets are not surrounded by an atmosphere which _we_ can\r\nbreathe!\r\n\r\nAfter trying such simple remedies as were within her reach, and trying\r\nthem without success, Blanche became seriously alarmed. Anne lay, to all\r\noutward appearance, dead in her arms. She was on the point of calling\r\nfor help--come what might of the discovery which would ensue--when the\r\ndoor from the hall opened once more, and Hester Dethridge entered the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe cook had accepted the alternative which her mistress\xe2\x80\x99s message had\r\nplaced before her, if she insisted on having her own time at her own\r\nsole disposal for the rest of that day. Exactly as Lady Lundie had\r\ndesired, she intimated her resolution to carry her point by placing her\r\naccount-book on the desk in the library. It was only when this had been\r\ndone that Blanche received any answer to her entreaties for help. Slowly\r\nand deliberately Hester Dethridge walked up to the spot where the young\r\ngirl knelt with Anne\xe2\x80\x99s head on her bosom, and looked at the two without\r\na trace of human emotion in her stern and stony face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see what\xe2\x80\x99s happened?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you alive or dead?\r\nOh, Hester, I can\xe2\x80\x99t bring her to! Look at her! look at her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge looked at her, and shook her head. Looked again,\r\nthought for a while and wrote on her slate. Held out the slate over\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s body, and showed what she had written:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho has done it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou stupid creature!\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody has done it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe eyes of Hester Dethridge steadily read the worn white face, telling\r\nits own tale of sorrow mutely on Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s breast. The mind of Hester\r\nDethridge steadily looked back at her own knowledge of her own miserable\r\nmarried life. She again returned to writing on her slate--again showed\r\nthe written words to Blanche.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrought to it by a man. Let her be--and God will take her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou horrid unfeeling woman! how dare you write such an abominable\r\nthing!\xe2\x80\x9d With this natural outburst of indignation, Blanche looked\r\nback at Anne; and, daunted by the death-like persistency of the swoon,\r\nappealed again to the mercy of the immovable woman who was looking down\r\nat her. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Hester! for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake help me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cook dropped her slate at her side and bent her head gravely in\r\nsign that she submitted. She motioned to Blanche to loosen Anne\xe2\x80\x99s dress,\r\nand then--kneeling on one knee--took Anne to support her while it was\r\nbeing done.\r\n\r\nThe instant Hester Dethridge touched her, the swooning woman gave signs\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nA faint shudder ran through her from head to foot--her eyelids\r\ntrembled--half opened for a moment--and closed again. As they closed, a\r\nlow sigh fluttered feebly from her lips.\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge put her back in Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s arms--considered a little\r\nwith herself--returned to writing on her slate--and held out the written\r\nwords once more:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShivered when I touched her. That means I have been walking over her\r\ngrave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche turned from the sight of the slate, and from the sight of the\r\nwoman, in horror. \xe2\x80\x9cYou frighten me!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will frighten _her_\r\nif she sees you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to offend you; but--leave us, please leave\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge accepted her dismissal, as she accepted every thing\r\nelse. She bowed her head in sign that she understood--looked for the\r\nlast time at Anne--dropped a stiff courtesy to her young mistress--and\r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the butler had paid her, and she had left the house.\r\n\r\nBlanche breathed more freely when she found herself alone. She could\r\nfeel the relief now of seeing Anne revive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you hear me, darling?\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you let me leave you for\r\na moment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s eyes slowly opened and looked round her--in that torment and\r\nterror of reviving life which marks the awful protest of humanity\r\nagainst its recall to existence when mortal mercy has dared to wake it\r\nin the arms of Death.\r\n\r\nBlanche rested Anne\xe2\x80\x99s head against the nearest chair, and ran to the\r\ntable upon which she had placed the wine on entering the room.\r\n\r\nAfter swallowing the first few drops Anne begun to feel the effect of\r\nthe stimulant. Blanche persisted in making her empty the glass, and\r\nrefrained from asking or answering questions until her recovery under\r\nthe influence of the wine was complete.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have overexerted yourself this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, as soon as\r\nit seemed safe to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody has seen you, darling--nothing has\r\nhappened. Do you feel like yourself again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne made an attempt to rise and leave the library; Blanche placed her\r\ngently in the chair, and went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is not the least need to stir. We have another quarter of an\r\nhour to ourselves before any body is at all likely to disturb us. I have\r\nsomething to say, Anne--a little proposal to make. Will you listen to\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne took Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and p ressed it gratefully to her lips. She\r\nmade no other reply. Blanche proceeded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t ask any questions, my dear--I won\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to keep you here\r\nagainst your will--I won\xe2\x80\x99t even remind you of my letter yesterday. But\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t let you go, Anne, without having my mind made easy about you in\r\nsome way. You will relieve all my anxiety, if you will do one thing--one\r\neasy thing for my sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Blanche?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put that question with her mind far away from the subject before\r\nher. Blanche was too eager in pursuit of her object to notice the absent\r\ntone, the purely mechanical manner, in which Anne had spoken to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to consult my uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick is\r\ninterested in you; Sir Patrick proposed to me this very day to go and\r\nsee you at the inn. He is the wisest, the kindest, the dearest old man\r\nliving--and you can trust him as you could trust nobody else. Will you\r\ntake my uncle into your confidence, and be guided by his advice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith her mind still far away from the subject, Anne looked out absently\r\nat the lawn, and made no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cOne word isn\xe2\x80\x99t much to say. Is it Yes or No?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill looking out on the lawn--still thinking of something else--Anne\r\nyielded, and said \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche was enchanted. \xe2\x80\x9cHow well I must have managed it!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what my uncle means, when my uncle talks of \xe2\x80\x98putting it\r\nstrongly.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bent down over Anne, and gayly patted her on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the wisest \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 darling, you ever said in your life. Wait\r\nhere--and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go in to luncheon, or they will be sending to know what\r\nhas become of me. Sir Patrick has kept my place for me, next to himself.\r\nI shall contrive to tell him what I want; and _he_ will contrive (oh,\r\nthe blessing of having to do with a clever man; these are so few of\r\nthem!)--he will contrive to leave the table before the rest, without\r\nexciting any body\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions. Go away with him at once to the\r\nsummer-house (we have been at the summer-house all the morning; nobody\r\nwill go back to it now), and I will follow you as soon as I have\r\nsatisfied Lady Lundie by eating some lunch. Nobody will be any the\r\nwiser but our three selves. In five minutes or less you may expect Sir\r\nPatrick. Let me go! We haven\xe2\x80\x99t a moment to lose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne held her back. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s attention was concentrated on her now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going on happily with Arnold, Blanche?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArnold is nicer than ever, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the day fixed for your marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe day will be ages hence. Not till we are back in town, at the end of\r\nthe autumn. Let me go, Anne!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me a kiss, Blanche.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche kissed her, and tried to release her hand. Anne held it as if\r\nshe was drowning, as if her life depended on not letting it go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you always love me, Blanche, as you love me now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you ask me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ said Yes just now. _You_ say Yes too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche said it. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s eyes fastened on her face, with one long,\r\nyearning look, and then Anne\xe2\x80\x99s hand suddenly dropped hers.\r\n\r\nShe ran out of the room, more agitated, more uneasy, than she liked\r\nto confess to herself. Never had she felt so certain of the urgent\r\nnecessity of appealing to Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s advice as she felt at that\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe guests were still safe at the luncheon-table when Blanche entered\r\nthe dining-room.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie expressed the necessary surprise, in the properly graduated\r\ntone of reproof, at her step-daughter\xe2\x80\x99s want of punctuality. Blanche\r\nmade her apologies with the most exemplary humility. She glided into her\r\nchair by her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s side, and took the first thing that was offered to\r\nher. Sir Patrick looked at his niece, and found himself in the company\r\nof a model young English Miss--and marveled inwardly what it might mean.\r\n\r\nThe talk, interrupted for the moment (topics, Politics and Sport--and\r\nthen, when a change was wanted, Sport and Politics), was resumed\r\nagain all round the table. Under cover of the conversation, and in\r\nthe intervals of receiving the attentions of the gentlemen, Blanche\r\nwhispered to Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t start, uncle. Anne is in the library.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n (Polite Mr. Smith offered some ham. Gratefully declined.) \xe2\x80\x9cPray, pray,\r\npray go to her; she is waiting to see you--she is in dreadful trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n (Gallant Mr. Jones proposed fruit tart and cream. Accepted with thanks.)\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake her to the summer-house: I\xe2\x80\x99ll follow you when I get the chance.\r\nAnd manage it at once, uncle, if you love me, or you will be too late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore Sir Patrick could whisper back a word in reply, Lady Lundie,\r\ncutting a cake of the richest Scottish composition, at the other end of\r\nthe table, publicly proclaimed it to be her \xe2\x80\x9cown cake,\xe2\x80\x9d and, as such,\r\noffered her brother-in-law a slice. The slice exhibited an eruption of\r\nplums and sweetmeats, overlaid by a perspiration of butter. It has been\r\nsaid that Sir Patrick had reached the age of seventy--it is, therefore,\r\nneedless to add that he politely declined to commit an unprovoked\r\noutrage on his own stomach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY cake!\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Lady Lundie, elevating the horrible composition on\r\na fork. \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t that tempt you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick saw his way to slipping out of the room under cover of a\r\ncompliment to his sister-in-law. He summoned his courtly smile, and laid\r\nhis hand on his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fallible mortal,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis met by a temptation which he can not\r\npossibly resist. If he is a wise mortal, also, what does he do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe eats some of My cake,\xe2\x80\x9d said the prosaic Lady Lundie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick, with a look of unutterable devotion directed at\r\nhis sister-in-law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe flies temptation, dear lady--as I do now.\xe2\x80\x9d He bowed, and escaped,\r\nunsuspected, from the room.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie cast down her eyes, with an expression of virtuous\r\nindulgence for human frailty, and divided Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s compliment\r\nmodestly between herself and her cake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell aware that his own departure from the table would be followed in a\r\nfew minutes by the rising of the lady of the house, Sir Patrick hurried\r\nto the library as fast as his lame foot would let him. Now that he was\r\nalone, his manner became anxious, and his face looked grave. He entered\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nNot a sign of Anne Silvester was to be seen any where. The library was a\r\nperfect solitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cThis looks bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a moment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection he went back into the hall to get his hat.\r\nIt was possible that she might have been afraid of discovery if\r\nshe staid in the library, and that she might have gone on to the\r\nsummer-house by herself.\r\n\r\nIf she was not to be found in the summer-house, the quieting of\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s mind and the clearing up of her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions alike\r\ndepended on discovering the place in which Miss Silvester had taken\r\nrefuge. In this case time would be of importance, and the capacity of\r\nmaking the most of it would be a precious capacity at starting. Arriving\r\nrapidly at these conclusions, Sir Patrick rang the bell in the hall\r\nwhich communicated with the servants\xe2\x80\x99 offices, and summoned his own\r\nvalet--a person of tried discretion and fidelity, nearly as old as\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet your hat, Duncan,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when the valet appeared, \xe2\x80\x9cand come out\r\nwith me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaster and servant set forth together silently on their way through the\r\ngrounds. Arrived within sight of the summer-house, Sir Patrick ordered\r\nDuncan to wait, and went on by himself.\r\n\r\nThere was not the least need for the precaution that he had taken.\r\nThe summer-house was as empty as the library. He stepped out again\r\nand looked about him. Not a living creature was visible. Sir Patrick\r\nsummoned his servant to join him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo back to the stables, Duncan,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand say that Miss Lundie\r\nlends me her pony-carriage to-day. Let it be got ready at once and kept\r\nin the stable-yard. I want to attract as little notice as possible.\r\nYou are to go with me, and nobody else. Provide yourself with a railway\r\ntime-table. Have you got any money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you happen to see the governess (Miss Silvester) on the day when we\r\ncame here--the day of the lawn-party?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did, Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you know her again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought her a very distinguished-looking person, Sir Patrick. I\r\nshould certainly know her again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any reason to think she noticed you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe never even looked at me, Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. Put a change of linen into your bag, Duncan--I may possibly\r\nwant you to take a journey by railway. Wait for me in the stable-yard.\r\nThis is a matter in which every thing is trusted to my discretion, and\r\nto yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that acknowledgment of the compliment which had been just paid to\r\nhim, Duncan gravely went his way to the stables; and Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s master\r\nreturned to the summer-house, to wait there until he was joined by\r\nBlanche.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick showed signs of failing patience during the interval of\r\nexpectation through which he was now condemned to pass. He applied\r\nperpetually to the snuff-box in the knob of his cane. He fidgeted\r\nincessantly in and out of the summer-house. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance had\r\nplaced a serious obstacle in the way of further discovery; and there\r\nwas no attacking that obstacle, until precious time had been wasted in\r\nwaiting to see Blanche.\r\n\r\nAt last she appeared in view, from the steps of the summer-house;\r\nbreathless and eager, hasting to the place of meeting as fast as her\r\nfeet would take her to it.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick considerately advanced, to spare her the shock of making the\r\ninevitable discovery. \xe2\x80\x9cBlanche,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTry to prepare yourself, my\r\ndear, for a disappointment. I am alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you have let her go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor child! I have never seen her at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche pushed by him, and ran into the summer-house. Sir Patrick\r\nfollowed her. She came out again to meet him, with a look of blank\r\ndespair. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, uncle! I did so truly pity her! And see how little pity\r\nshe has for _me!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick put his arm round his niece, and softly patted the fair\r\nyoung head that dropped on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let us judge her harshly, my dear: we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what serious\r\nnecessity may not plead her excuse. It is plain that she can trust\r\nnobody--and that she only consented to see me to get you out of the room\r\nand spare you the pain of parting. Compose yourself, Blanche. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndespair of discovering where she has gone, if you will help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche lifted her head, and dried her tears bravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father himself wasn\xe2\x80\x99t kinder to me than you are,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly\r\ntell me, uncle, what I can do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to hear exactly what happened in the library,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForget nothing, my dear child, no matter how trifling it may be.\r\nTrifles are precious to us, and minutes are precious to us, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche followed her instructions to the letter, her uncle listening\r\nwith the closest attention. When she had completed her narrative,\r\nSir Patrick suggested leaving the summer-house. \xe2\x80\x9cI have ordered your\r\nchaise,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand I can tell you what I propose doing on our way to\r\nthe stable-yard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me drive you, uncle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, my dear, for saying No to that. Your step-mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuspicions are very easily excited--and you had better not be seen with\r\nme if my inquiries take me to the Craig Fernie inn. I promise, if you\r\nwill remain here, to tell you every thing when I come back. Join the\r\nothers in any plan they have for the afternoon--and you will prevent my\r\nabsence from exciting any thing more than a passing remark. You will do\r\nas I tell you? That\xe2\x80\x99s a good girl! Now you shall hear how I propose to\r\nsearch for this poor lady, and how your little story has helped me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, considering with himself whether he should begin by telling\r\nBlanche of his consultation with Geoffrey. Once more, he decided that\r\nquestion in the negative. Better to still defer taking her into his\r\nconfidence until he had performed the errand of investigation on which\r\nhe was now setting forth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you have told me, Blanche, divides itself, in my mind, into two\r\nheads,\xe2\x80\x9d began Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is what happened in the library before\r\nyour own eyes; and there is what Miss Silvester told you had happened at\r\nthe inn. As to the event in the library (in the first place), it is too\r\nlate now to inquire whether that fainting-fit was the result, as you\r\nsay, of mere exhaustion--or whether it was the result of something that\r\noccurred while you were out of the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat could have happened while I was out of the room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know no more than you do, my dear. It is simply one of the\r\npossibilities in the case, and, as such, I notice it. To get on to what\r\npractically concerns us; if Miss Silvester is in delicate health it is\r\nimpossible that she could get, unassisted, to any great distance from\r\nWindygates. She may have taken refuge in one of the cottages in our\r\nimmediate neighborhood. Or she may have met with some passing vehicle\r\nfrom one of the farms on its way to the station, and may have asked the\r\nperson driving to give her a seat in it. Or she may have walked as far\r\nas she can, and may have stopped to rest in some sheltered place, among\r\nthe lanes to the south of this house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll inquire at the cottages, uncle, while you are gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child, there must be a dozen cottages, at least, within a\r\ncircle of one mile from Windygates! Your inquiries would probably occupy\r\nyou for the whole afternoon. I won\xe2\x80\x99t ask what Lady Lundie would think of\r\nyour being away all that time by yourself. I will only remind you of two\r\nthings. You would be making a public matter of an investigation which\r\nit is essential to pursue as privately as possible; and, even if you\r\nhappened to hit on the right cottage your inquiries would be completely\r\nbaffled, and you would discover nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know the Scottish peasant better than you do, Blanche. In his\r\nintelligence and his sense of self-respect he is a very different being\r\nfrom the English peasant. He would receive you civilly, because you\r\nare a young lady; but he would let you see, at the same time, that\r\nhe considered you had taken advantage of the difference between your\r\nposition and his position to commit an intrusion. And if Miss Silvester\r\nhad appealed, in confidence, to his hospitality, and if he had granted\r\nit, no power on earth would induce him to tell any person living that\r\nshe was under his roof--without her express permission.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, uncle, if it\xe2\x80\x99s of no use making inquiries of any body, how are we\r\nto find her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say that nobody will answer our inquiries, my dear--I only say\r\nthe peasantry won\xe2\x80\x99t answer them, if your friend has trusted herself to\r\ntheir protection. The way to find her is to look on, beyond what Miss\r\nSilvester may be doing at the present moment, to what Miss Silvester\r\ncontemplates doing--let us say, before the day is out. We may assume,\r\nI think (after what has happened), that, as soon as she can leave this\r\nneighborhood, she assuredly will leave it. Do you agree, so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! yes! Go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. She is a woman, and she is (to say the least of it) not\r\nstrong. She can only leave this neighborhood either by hiring a vehicle\r\nor by traveling on the railway. I propose going first to the station.\r\nAt the rate at which your pony gets over the ground, there is a fair\r\nchance, in spite of the time we have lost, of my being there as soon as\r\nshe is--assuming that she leaves by the first train, up or down, that\r\npasses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a train in half an hour, uncle. She can never get there in\r\ntime for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe may be less exhausted than we think; or she may get a lift; or she\r\nmay not be alone. How do we know but somebody may have been waiting in\r\nthe lane--her husband, if there is such a person--to help her? No! I\r\nshall assume she is now on her way to the station; and I shall get there\r\nas fast as possible--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd stop her, if you find her there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I do, Blanche, must be left to my discretion. If I find her there,\r\nI must act for the best. If I don\xe2\x80\x99t find her there, I shall leave Duncan\r\n(who goes with me) on the watch for the remaining trains, until the last\r\nto-night. He knows Miss Silvester by sight, and he is sure that _she_\r\nhas never noticed _him._ Whether she goes north or south, early or late,\r\nDuncan will have my orders to follow her. He is thoroughly to be relied\r\non. If she takes the railway, I answer for it we shall know where she\r\ngoes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow clever of you to think of Duncan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least, my dear. Duncan is my factotum; and the course I am\r\ntaking is the obvious course which would have occurred to any body.\r\nLet us get to the re ally difficult part of it now. Suppose she hires a\r\ncarriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are none to be had, except at the station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are farmers about here--and farmers have light carts, or chaises,\r\nor something of the sort. It is in the last degree unlikely that\r\nthey would consent to let her have them. Still, women break through\r\ndifficulties which stop men. And this is a clever woman, Blanche--a\r\nwoman, you may depend on it, who is bent on preventing you from tracing\r\nher. I confess I wish we had somebody we could trust lounging about\r\nwhere those two roads branch off from the road that leads to the\r\nrailway. I must go in another direction; _I_ can\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArnold can do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick looked a little doubtful. \xe2\x80\x9cArnold is an excellent fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut can we trust to his discretion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is, next to you, the most perfectly discreet person I know,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n rejoined Blanche, in a very positive manner; \xe2\x80\x9cand, what is more, I have\r\ntold him every thing about Anne, except what has happened to-day. I am\r\nafraid I shall tell him _that,_ when I feel lonely and miserable,\r\nafter you have gone. There is something in Arnold--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nit is--that comforts me. Besides, do you think he would betray a secret\r\nthat I gave him to keep? You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how devoted he is to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Blanche, I am not the cherished object of his devotion; of\r\ncourse I don\xe2\x80\x99t know! You are the only authority on that point. I stand\r\ncorrected. Let us have Arnold, by all means. Caution him to be careful;\r\nand send him out by himself, where the roads meet. We have now only one\r\nother place left in which there is a chance of finding a trace of her. I\r\nundertake to make the necessary investigation at the Craig Fernie inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Craig Fernie inn? Uncle! you have forgotten what I told you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a little, my dear. Miss Silvester herself has left the inn, I\r\ngrant you. But (if we should unhappily fail in finding her by any other\r\nmeans) Miss Silvester has left a trace to guide us at Craig Fernie. That\r\ntrace must be picked up at once, in case of accidents. You don\xe2\x80\x99t seem\r\nto follow me? I am getting over the ground as fast as the pony gets\r\nover it. I have arrived at the second of those two heads into which your\r\nstory divides itself in my mind. What did Miss Silvester tell you had\r\nhappened at the inn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe lost a letter at the inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. She lost a letter at the inn; that is one event. And\r\nBishopriggs, the waiter, has quarreled with Mrs. Inchbare, and has left\r\nhis situation; that is another event. As to the letter first. It is\r\neither really lost, or it has been stolen. In either case, if we can\r\nlay our hands on it, there is at least a chance of its helping us to\r\ndiscover something. As to Bishopriggs, next--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not going to talk about the waiter, surely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am! Bishopriggs possesses two important merits. He is a link in my\r\nchain of reasoning; and he is an old friend of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA friend of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe live in days, my dear, when one workman talks of another workman as\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that gentleman.\xe2\x80\x99--I march with the age, and feel bound to mention my\r\nclerk as my friend. A few years since Bishopriggs was employed in the\r\nclerks\xe2\x80\x99 room at my chambers. He is one of the most intelligent and\r\nmost unscrupulous old vagabonds in Scotland; perfectly honest as to\r\nall average matters involving pounds, shillings, and pence; perfectly\r\nunprincipled in the pursuit of his own interests, where the violation\r\nof a trust lies on the boundary-line which marks the limit of the law. I\r\nmade two unpleasant discoveries when I had him in my employment. I found\r\nthat he had contrived to supply himself with a duplicate of my seal; and\r\nI had the strongest reason to suspect him of tampering with some papers\r\nbelonging to two of my clients. He had done no actual mischief, so far;\r\nand I had no time to waste in making out the necessary case against him.\r\nHe was dismissed from my service, as a man who was not to be trusted to\r\nrespect any letters or papers that happened to pass through his hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, uncle! I see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlain enough now--isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? If that missing letter of Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nis a letter of no importance, I am inclined to believe that it is merely\r\nlost, and may be found again. If, on the other hand, there is any thing\r\nin it that could promise the most remote advantage to any person in\r\npossession of it, then, in the execrable slang of the day, I will lay\r\nany odds, Blanche, that Bishopriggs has got the letter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he has left the inn! How unfortunate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunate as causing delay--nothing worse than that. Unless I am very\r\nmuch mistaken, Bishopriggs will come back to the inn. The old rascal\r\n(there is no denying it) is a most amusing person. He left a terrible\r\nblank when he left my clerks\xe2\x80\x99 room. Old customers at Craig Fernie\r\n(especially the English), in missing Bishopriggs, will, you may rely on\r\nit, miss one of the attractions of the inn. Mrs. Inchbare is not a woman\r\nto let her dignity stand in the way of her business. She and Bishopriggs\r\nwill come together again, sooner or later, and make it up. When I have\r\nput certain questions to her, which may possibly lead to very important\r\nresults, I shall leave a letter for Bishopriggs in Mrs. Inchbare\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands. The letter will tell him I have something for him to do, and will\r\ncontain an address at which he can write to me. I shall hear of him,\r\nBlanche and, if the letter is in his possession, I shall get it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t he be afraid--if he has stolen the letter--to tell you he has got\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well put, my child. He might hesitate with other people. But I\r\nhave my own way of dealing with him--and I know how to make him tell\r\nMe.--Enough of Bishopriggs till his time comes. There is one other\r\npoint, in regard to Miss Silvester. I may have to describe her. How\r\nwas she dressed when she came here? Remember, I am a man--and (if an\r\nEnglishwoman\xe2\x80\x99s dress _can_ be described in an Englishwoman\xe2\x80\x99s language)\r\ntell me, in English, what she had on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wore a straw hat, with corn-flowers in it, and a white veil.\r\nCorn-flowers at one side uncle, which is less common than cornflowers in\r\nfront. And she had on a light gray shawl. And a _Pique;_--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you go with your French! Not a word more! A straw hat, with a\r\nwhite veil, and with corn-flowers at one side of the hat. And a light\r\ngray shawl. That\xe2\x80\x99s as much as the ordinary male mind can take in; and\r\nthat will do. I have got my instructions, and saved precious time. So\r\nfar so good. Here we are at the end of our conference--in other words,\r\nat the gate of the stable-yard. You understand what you have to do while\r\nI am away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to send Arnold to the cross-roads. And I have to behave (if I\r\ncan) as if nothing had happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood child! Well put again! you have got what I call grasp of mind,\r\nBlanche. An invaluable faculty! You will govern the future domestic\r\nkingdom. Arnold will be nothing but a constitutional husband. Those are\r\nthe only husbands who are thoroughly happy. You shall hear every\r\nthing, my love, when I come lack. Got your bag, Duncan? Good. And the\r\ntime-table? Good. You take the reins--I won\xe2\x80\x99t drive. I want to think.\r\nDriving is incompatible with intellectual exertion. A man puts his\r\nmind into his horse, and sinks to the level of that useful animal--as a\r\nnecessary condition of getting to his destination without being upset.\r\nGod bless you, Blanche! To the station, Duncan! to the station!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE TWENTY-THIRD.\r\n\r\nTRACED.\r\n\r\nTHE chaise rattled our through the gates. The dogs barked furiously. Sir\r\nPatrick looked round, and waved his hand as he turned the corner of the\r\nroad. Blanche was left alone in the yard.\r\n\r\nShe lingered a little, absently patting the dogs. They had especial\r\nclaims on her sympathy at that moment; they, too, evidently thought it\r\nhard to be left behind at the house. After a while she roused herself.\r\nSir Patrick had left the responsibility of superintending the crossroads\r\non her shoulders. There was something to be done yet before the\r\narrangements for tracing Anne were complete. Blanche left the yard to do\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOn her way back to the house she met Arnold, dispatched by Lady Lundie\r\nin search of her.\r\n\r\nThe plan of occupation for the afternoon had been settled during\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s absence. Some demon had whispered to Lady Lundie to cultivate\r\na taste for feudal antiquities, and to insist on spreading that taste\r\namong her guests. She had proposed an excursion to an old baronial\r\ncastle among the hills--far to the westward (fortunately for Sir\r\nPatrick\xe2\x80\x99s chance of escaping discovery) of the hills at Craig Fernie.\r\nSome of the guests were to ride, and some to accompany their hostess in\r\nthe open carriage. Looking right and left for proselytes, Lady Lundie\r\nhad necessarily remarked the disappearance of certain members of her\r\ncircle. Mr. Delamayn had vanished, nobody knew where. Sir Patrick and\r\nBlanche had followed his example. Her ladyship had observed, upon this,\r\nwith some asperity, that if they were all to treat each other in\r\nthat unceremonious manner, the sooner Windygates was turned into a\r\nPenitentiary, on the silent system, the fitter the house would be for\r\nthe people who inhabited it. Under these circumstances, Arnold suggested\r\nthat Blanche would do well to make her excuses as soon as possible at\r\nhead-quarters, and accept the seat in the carriage which her step-mother\r\nwished her to take. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are in for the feudal antiquities, Blanche; and\r\nwe must help each other through as well as we can. If you will go in the\r\ncarriage, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are serious reasons for _my_ keeping up appearances,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall go in the carriage. You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t go at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold naturally looked a little surprised, and asked to be favored with\r\nan explanation.\r\n\r\nBlanche took his arm and hugged it close. Now that Anne was lost, Arnold\r\nwas more precious to her than ever. She literally hungered to hear at\r\nthat moment, from his own lips, how fond he was of her. It mattered\r\nnothing that she was already perfectly satisfied on this point. It was\r\nso nice (after he had said it five hundred times already) to make him\r\nsay it once more!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I had no explanation to give?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you stay behind\r\nby yourself to please me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would do any thing to please you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really love me as much as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were still in the yard; and the only witnesses present were\r\nthe dogs. Arnold answered in the language without words--which is\r\nnevertheless the most expressive language in use, between men and women,\r\nall over the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not doing my duty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche, penitently. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, oh Arnold,\r\nI am so anxious and so miserable! And it _is_ such a consolation to know\r\nthat _you_ won\xe2\x80\x99t turn your back on me too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that preface she told him what had happened in the library. Even\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of her lover\xe2\x80\x99s capacity for sympathizing with her was\r\nmore than realized by the effect which her narrative produced on Arnold.\r\nHe was not merely surprised and sorry for her. His face showed plainly\r\nthat he felt genuine concern and distress. He had never stood higher in\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s opinion than he stood at that moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHow does Sir Patrick propose to find\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche repeated Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s instructions relating to the crossroads,\r\nand also to the serious necessity of pursuing the investigation in the\r\nstrictest privacy. Arnold (relieved from all fear of being sent back\r\nto Craig Fernie) undertook to do every thing that was asked of him, and\r\npromised to keep the secret from every body.\r\n\r\nThey went back to the house, and met with an icy welcome from Lady\r\nLundie. Her ladyship repeated her remark on the subject of turning\r\nWindygates into a Penitentiary for Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s benefit. She received\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s petition to be excused from going to see the castle with the\r\nbarest civility. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, take your walk by all means! You may meet your\r\nfriend, Mr. Delamayn--who appears to have such a passion for walking\r\nthat he can\xe2\x80\x99t even wait till luncheon is over. As for Sir Patrick--Oh!\r\nSir Patrick has borrowed the pony-carriage? and gone out driving by\r\nhimself?--I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I never meant to offend my brother-in-law when I\r\noffered him a slice of my poor little cake. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me offend any\r\nbody else. Dispose of your afternoon, Blanche, without the slightest\r\nreference to me. Nobody seems inclined to visit the ruins--the most\r\ninteresting relic of feudal times in Perthshire, Mr. Brinkworth. It\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter--oh, dear me, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter! I can\xe2\x80\x99t force my guests\r\nto feel an intelligent curiosity on the subject of Scottish Antiquities.\r\nNo! no! my dear Blanche!--it won\xe2\x80\x99t be the first time, or the last, that\r\nI have driven out alone. I don\xe2\x80\x99t at all object to being alone. \xe2\x80\x98My\r\nmind to me a kingdom is,\xe2\x80\x99 as the poet says.\xe2\x80\x9d So Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s outraged\r\nself-importance asserted its violated claims on human respect, until\r\nher distinguished medical guest came to the rescue and smoothed his\r\nhostess\xe2\x80\x99s ruffled plumes. The surgeon (he privately detested ruins)\r\nbegged to go. Blanche begged to go. Smith and Jones (profoundly\r\ninterested in feudal antiquities) said they would sit behind, in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9crumble\xe2\x80\x9d--rather than miss this unexpected treat. One, Two, and Three\r\ncaught the infection, and volunteered to be the escort on horseback.\r\nLady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s celebrated \xe2\x80\x9csmile\xe2\x80\x9d (warranted to remain unaltered on her\r\nface for hours together) made its appearance once more. She issued her\r\norders with the most charming amiability. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll take the guidebook,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said her ladyship, with the eye to mean economy, which is only to be met\r\nwith in very rich people, \xe2\x80\x9cand save a shilling to the man who shows the\r\nruins.\xe2\x80\x9d With that she went up stairs to array herself for the drive,\r\nand looked in the glass; and saw a perfectly virtuous, fascinating, and\r\naccomplished woman, facing her irresistibly in a new French bonnet!\r\n\r\nAt a private signal from Blanche, Arnold slipped out and repaired to his\r\npost, where the roads crossed the road that led to the railway.\r\n\r\nThere was a space of open heath on one side of him, and the stonewall\r\nand gates of a farmhouse inclosure on the other. Arnold sat down on\r\nthe soft heather--and lit a cigar--and tried to see his way through the\r\ndouble mystery of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s appearance and Anne\xe2\x80\x99s flight.\r\n\r\nHe had interpreted his friend\xe2\x80\x99s absence exactly as his friend had\r\nanticipated: he could only assume that Geoffrey had gone to keep a\r\nprivate appointment with Anne. Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s appearance at Windygates\r\nalone, and Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety to hear the names of the gentlemen\r\nwho were staying in the house, seemed, under these circumstances,\r\nto point to the plain conclusion that the two had, in some way,\r\nunfortunately missed each other. But what could be the motive of her\r\nflight? Whether she knew of some other place in which she might meet\r\nGeoffrey? or whether she had gone back to the inn? or whether she had\r\nacted under some sudden impulse of despair?--were questions which Arnold\r\nwas necessarily quite incompetent to solve. There was no choice but\r\nto wait until an opportunity offered of reporting what had happened to\r\nGeoffrey himself.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of half an hour, the sound of some approaching\r\nvehicle--the first sound of the sort that he had heard--attracted\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s attention. He started up, and saw the pony-chaise approaching\r\nhim along the road from the station. Sir Patrick, this time, was\r\ncompelled to drive himself--Duncan was not with him. On discovering\r\nArnold, he stopped the pony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo! so!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard all about it, I see?\r\nYou understand that this is to be a secret from every body, till further\r\nnotice? Very good, Has any thing happened since you have been here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. Have you made any discoveries, Sir Patrick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone. I got to the station before the train. No signs of Miss Silvester\r\nany where. I have left Duncan on the watch--with orders not to stir till\r\nthe last train has passed to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think she will turn up at the station,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cI fancy\r\nshe has gone back to Craig Fernie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite possible. I am now on my way to Craig Fernie, to make inquiries\r\nabout her. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long I may be detained, or what it may\r\nlead to. If you see Blanche before I do tell her I have instructed the\r\nstation-master to let me know (if Miss Silvester does take the railway)\r\nwhat place she books for. Thanks to that arrangement, we sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nto wait for news till Duncan can telegraph that he has seen her to her\r\njourney\xe2\x80\x99s end. In the mean time, you understand what you are wanted to\r\ndo here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlanche has explained every thing to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStick to your post, and make good use of your eyes. You were accustomed\r\nto that, you know, when you were at sea. It\xe2\x80\x99s no great hardship to pass\r\na few hours in this delicious summer air. I see you have contracted the\r\nvile modern habit of smoking--that will be occupation enough to amuse\r\nyou, no doubt! Keep the roads in view; and, if she does come your\r\nway, don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to stop her--you can\xe2\x80\x99t do that. Speak to her (quite\r\ninnocently, mind!), by way of getting time enough to notice the face of\r\nthe man who is driving her, and the name (if there is one) on his cart.\r\nDo that, and you will do enough. Pah! how that cigar poisons the air!\r\nWhat will have become of your stomach when you get to my age?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t complain, Sir Patrick, if I can eat as good a dinner as you\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat reminds me! I met somebody I knew at the station. Hester Dethridge\r\nhas left her place, and gone to London by the train. We may feed at\r\nWindygates--we have done with dining now. It has been a final quarrel\r\nthis time between the mistress and the cook. I have given Hester my\r\naddress in London, and told her to let me know before she decides on\r\nanother place. A woman who _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ talk, and a woman who _can_ cook, is\r\nsimply a woman who has arrived at absolute perfection. Such a treasure\r\nshall not go out of the family, if I can help it. Did you notice the\r\nBechamel sauce at lunch? Pooh! a young man who smokes cigars\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t know the difference between Bechamel sauce and melted\r\nbutter. Good afternoon! good afternoon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe slackened the reins, and away he went to Craig Fernie. Counting by\r\nyears, the pony was twenty, and the pony\xe2\x80\x99s driver was seventy. Counting\r\nby vivacity and spirit, two of the most youthful characters in Scotland\r\nhad got together that afternoon in the same chaise.\r\n\r\nAn hour more wore itself slowly out; and nothing had passed Arnold on\r\nthe cross-roads but a few stray foot-passengers, a heavy wagon, and a\r\ngig with an old woman in it. He rose again from the heather, weary of\r\ninaction, and resolved to walk backward and forward, within view of his\r\npost, for a change. At the second turn, when his face happened to be set\r\ntoward the open heath, he noticed another foot-passenger--apparently a\r\nman--far away in the empty distance. Was the person coming toward him?\r\n\r\nHe advanced a little. The stranger was doubtless advancing too, so\r\nrapidly did his figure now reveal itself, beyond all doubt, as the\r\nfigure of a man. A few minutes more and Arnold fancied he recognized it.\r\nYet a little longer, and he was quite sure. There was no mistaking the\r\nlithe strength and grace of _that_ man, and the smooth easy swiftness\r\nwith which he covered his ground. It was the hero of the coming\r\nfoot-race. It was Geoffrey on his way back to Windygates House.\r\n\r\nArnold hurried forward to meet him. Geoffrey stood still, poising\r\nhimself on his stick, and let the other come up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard what has happened at the house?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arnold.\r\n\r\nHe instinctively checked the next question as it rose to his lips.\r\nThere was a settled defiance in the expression of Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s face, which\r\nArnold was quite at a loss to understand. He looked like a man who\r\nhad made up his mind to confront any thing that could happen, and to\r\ncontradict any body who spoke to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething seems to have annoyed you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s up at the house?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Geoffrey, with his loudest voice and\r\nhis hardest look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Silvester has been at the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho saw her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody but Blanche.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she was miserably weak and ill, so ill that she fainted, poor\r\nthing, in the library. Blanche brought her to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were all at lunch at the time. Blanche left the library, to speak\r\nprivately to her uncle. When she went back Miss Silvester was gone, and\r\nnothing has been seen of her since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA row at the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody knows of it at the house, except Blanche--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you? And how many besides?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Sir Patrick. Nobody else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody else? Any thing more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold remembered his promise to keep the investigation then on foot\r\na secret from every body. Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s manner made him--unconsciously to\r\nhimself--readier than he might otherwise have been to consider Geoffrey\r\nas included in the general prohibition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing more,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey dug the point of his stick deep into the soft, sandy ground.\r\nHe looked at the stick, then suddenly pulled it out of the ground and\r\nlooked at Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-afternoon!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and went on his way again\r\nby himself.\r\n\r\nArnold followed, and stopped him. For a moment the two men looked at\r\neach other without a word passing on either side. Arnold spoke first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re out of humor, Geoffrey. What has upset you in this way? Have you\r\nand Miss Silvester missed each other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen her since she left Windygates?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know where Miss Silvester is now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill no reply. Still the same mutely-insolent defiance of look and\r\nmanner. Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s dark color began to deepen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you answer me?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I have had enough of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough of what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough of being worried about Miss Silvester. Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nbusiness--not yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGently, Geoffrey! Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that I have been mixed up in that\r\nbusiness--without seeking it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no fear of my forgetting. You have cast it in my teeth often\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCast it in your teeth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! Am I never to hear the last of my obligation to you? The devil\r\ntake the obligation! I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of the sound of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a spirit in Arnold--not easily brought to the surface,\r\nthrough the overlying simplicity and good-humor of his ordinary\r\ncharacter--which, once roused, was a spirit not readily quelled.\r\nGeoffrey had roused it at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you come to your senses,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll remember old times--and\r\nreceive your apology. Till you _do_ come to your senses, go your way by\r\nyourself. I have no more to say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey set his teeth, and came one step nearer. Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s eyes met his,\r\nwith a look which steadily and firmly challenged him--though he was\r\nthe stronger man of the two--to force the quarrel a step further, if he\r\ndared. The one human virtue which Geoffrey respected and understood\r\nwas the virtue of courage. And there it was before him--the undeniable\r\ncourage of the weaker man. The callous scoundrel was touched on the\r\none tender place in his whole being. He turned, and went on his way in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nLeft by himself, Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s head dropped on his breast. The friend who had\r\nsaved his life--the one friend he possessed, who was associated with\r\nhis earliest and happiest remembrances of old days--had grossly insulted\r\nhim: and had left him deliberately, without the slightest expression of\r\nregret. Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s affectionate nature--simple, loyal, clinging where\r\nit once fastened--was wounded to the quick. Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s fast-retreating\r\nfigure, in the open view before him, became blurred and indistinct. He\r\nput his hand over his eyes, and hid, with a boyish shame, the hot tears\r\nthat told of the heartache, and that honored the man who shed them.\r\n\r\nHe was still struggling with the emotion which had overpowered him, when\r\nsomething happened at the place where the roads met.\r\n\r\nThe four roads pointed as nearly as might be toward the four points of\r\nthe compass. Arnold was now on the road to the eastward, having advanced\r\nin that direction to meet Geoffrey, between two and three hundred yards\r\nfrom the farm-house inclosure before which he had kept his watch. The\r\nroad to the westward, curving away behind the farm, led to the nearest\r\nmarket-town. The road to the south was the way to the station. And the\r\nroad to the north led back to Windygates House.\r\n\r\nWhile Geoffrey was still fifty yards from the turning which would take\r\nhim back to Windygates--while the tears were still standing thickly in\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s eyes--the gate of the farm inclosure opened. A light four-wheel\r\nchaise came out with a man driving, and a woman sitting by his side. The\r\nwoman was Anne Silvester, and the man was the owner of the farm.\r\n\r\nInstead of taking the way which led to the station, the chaise pursued\r\nthe westward road to the market-town. Proceeding in this direction, the\r\nbacks of the persons in the vehicle were necessarily turned on Geoffrey,\r\nadvancing behind them from the eastward. He just carelessly noticed\r\nthe shabby little chaise, and then turned off north on his way to\r\nWindygates.\r\n\r\nBy the time Arnold was composed enough to look round him, the chaise\r\nhad taken the curve in the road which wound behind the farmhouse. He\r\nreturned--faithful to the engagement which he had undertaken--to his\r\npost before the inclosure. The chaise was then a speck in the distance.\r\nIn a minute more it was a speck out of sight.\r\n\r\nSo (to use Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s phrase) had the woman broken through\r\ndifficulties which would have stopped a man. So, in her sore need, had\r\nAnne Silvester won the sympathy which had given her a place, by the\r\nfarmer\xe2\x80\x99s side, in the vehicle that took him on his own business to the\r\nmarket-town. And so, by a hair\xe2\x80\x99s-breadth, did she escape the treble risk\r\nof discovery which threatened her--from Geoffrey, on his way back; from\r\nArnold, at his post; and from the valet, on the watch for her appearance\r\nat the station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe afternoon wore on. The servants at Windygates, airing themselves\r\nin the grounds--in the absence of their mistress and her guests--were\r\ndisturbed, for the moment, by the unexpected return of one of \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\ngentlefolks.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn reappeared at the house alone; went\r\nstraight to the smoking-room; and calling for another supply of the old\r\nale, settled himself in an arm-chair with the newspaper, and began to\r\nsmoke.\r\n\r\nHe soon tired of reading, and fell into thinking of what had happened\r\nduring the latter part of his walk.\r\n\r\nThe prospect before him had more than realized the most sanguine\r\nanticipations that he could have formed of it. He had braced\r\nhimself--after what had happened in the library--to face the outbreak\r\nof a serious scandal, on his return to the house. And here--when he came\r\nback--was nothing to face! Here were three people (Sir Patrick, Arnold,\r\nand Blanche) who must at least know that Anne was in some serious\r\ntrouble keeping the secret as carefully as if they felt that his\r\ninterests were at stake! And, more wonderful still, here was Anne\r\nherself--so far from raising a hue and cry after him--actually taking\r\nflight without saying a word that could compromise him with any living\r\nsoul!\r\n\r\nWhat in the name of wonder did it mean? He did his best to find his way\r\nto an explanation of some sort; and he actually contrived to account for\r\nthe silence of Blanche and her uncle, and Arnold. It was pretty clear\r\nthat they must have all three combined to keep Lady Lundie in ignorance\r\nof her runaway governess\xe2\x80\x99s return to the house.\r\n\r\nBut the secret of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s silence completely baffled him.\r\n\r\nHe was simply incapable of conceiving that the horror of seeing herself\r\nset up as an obstacle to Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s marriage might have been vivid\r\nenough to overpower all sense of her own wrongs, and to hurry her away,\r\nresolute, in her ignorance of what else to do, never to return again,\r\nand never to let living eyes rest on her in the character of Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s clean beyond _my_ making out,\xe2\x80\x9d was the final conclusion at\r\nwhich Geoffrey arrived. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s her interest to hold her tongue, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmy interest to hold mine, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of it for the present!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put up his feet on a chair, and rested his magnificent muscles after\r\nhis walk, and filled another pipe, in thorough contentment with himself.\r\nNo interference to dread from Anne, no more awkward questions (on the\r\nterms they were on now) to come from Arnold. He looked back at the\r\nquarrel on the heath with a certain complacency--he did his friend\r\njustice; though they _had_ disagreed. \xe2\x80\x9cWho would have thought the fellow\r\nhad so much pluck in him!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself as he struck the match and\r\nlit his second pipe.\r\n\r\nAn hour more wore on; and Sir Patrick was the next person who returned.\r\n\r\nHe was thoughtful, but in no sense depressed. Judging by appearances,\r\nhis errand to Craig Fernie had certainly not ended in disappointment.\r\nThe old gentleman hummed his favorite little Scotch air--rather\r\nabsently, perhaps--and took his pinch of snuff from the knob of his\r\nivory cane much as usual. He went to the library bell and summoned a\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny body been here for me?\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cNo letters?\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nSir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Come up stairs to my room, and help me on\r\nwith my dressing-gown.\xe2\x80\x9d The man helped him to his dressing-gown and\r\nslippers \xe2\x80\x9cIs Miss Lundie at home?\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir Patrick. They\xe2\x80\x99re all away\r\nwith my lady on an excursion.\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. Get me a cup of coffee; and\r\nwake me half an hour before dinner, in case I take a nap.\xe2\x80\x9d The servant\r\nwent out. Sir Patrick stretched himself on the sofa. \xe2\x80\x9cAy! ay! a little\r\naching in the back, and a certain stiffness in the legs. I dare say\r\nthe pony feels just as I do. Age, I suppose, in both cases? Well! well!\r\nwell! let\xe2\x80\x99s try and be young at heart. \xe2\x80\x98The rest\xe2\x80\x99 (as Pope says) \xe2\x80\x98is\r\nleather and prunella.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d He returned resignedly to his little Scotch air.\r\nThe servant came in with the coffee. And then the room was quiet, except\r\nfor the low humming of insects and the gentle rustling of the creepers\r\nat the window. For five minutes or so Sir Patrick sipped his coffee, and\r\nmeditated--by no means in the character of a man who was depressed by\r\nany recent disappointment. In five minutes more he was asleep.\r\n\r\nA little later, and the party returned from the ruins.\r\n\r\nWith the one exception of their lady-leader, the whole expedition was\r\ndepressed--Smith and Jones, in particular, being quite speechless. Lady\r\nLundie alone still met feudal antiquities with a cheerful front. She\r\nhad cheated the man who showed the ruins of his shilling, and she was\r\nthoroughly well satisfied with herself. Her voice was flute-like in\r\nits melody, and the celebrated \xe2\x80\x9csmile\xe2\x80\x9d had never been in better order.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeeply interesting!\xe2\x80\x9d said her ladyship, descending from the carriage\r\nwith ponderous grace, and addressing herself to Geoffrey, lounging under\r\nthe portico of the house. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have had a loss, Mr. Delamayn. The next\r\ntime you go out for a walk, give your hostess a word of warning, and you\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t repent it.\xe2\x80\x9d Blanche (looking very weary and anxious) questioned\r\nthe servant, the moment she got in, about Arnold and her uncle. Sir\r\nPatrick was invisible up stairs. Mr. Brinkworth had not come back. It\r\nwanted only twenty minutes of dinner-time; and full evening-dress was\r\ninsisted on at Windygates. Blanche, nevertheless, still lingered in the\r\nhall in the hope of seeing Arnold before she went up stairs. The hope\r\nwas realized. As the clock struck the quarter he came in. And he, too,\r\nwas out of spirits like the rest!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen her?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Blanche.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold, in the most perfect good faith. \xe2\x80\x9cThe way she has\r\nescaped by is not the way by the cross-roads--I answer for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey separated to dress. When the party assembled again, in the library,\r\nbefore dinner, Blanche found her way, the moment he entered the room, to\r\nSir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNews, uncle! I\xe2\x80\x99m dying for news.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood news, my dear--so far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have found Anne?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard of her at Craig Fernie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have made some important discoveries at Craig Fernie, Blanche. Hush!\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s your step-mother. Wait till after dinner, and you may hear more\r\nthan I can tell you now. There may be news from the station between this\r\nand then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dinner was a wearisome ordeal to at least two other persons\r\npresent besides Blanche. Arnold, sitting opposite to Geoffrey, without\r\nexchanging a word with him, felt the altered relations between his\r\nformer friend and himself very painfully. Sir Patrick, missing the\r\nskilled hand of Hester Dethridge in every dish that was offered to\r\nhim, marked the dinner among the wasted opportunities of his life, and\r\nresented his sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s flow of spirits as something simply inhuman\r\nunder present circumstances. Blanche followed Lady Lundie into the\r\ndrawing-room in a state of burning impatience for the rising of\r\nthe gentlemen from their wine. Her step-mother--mapping out a new\r\nantiquarian excursion for the next day, and finding Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s ears\r\nclosed to her occasional remarks on baronial Scotland five hundred years\r\nsince--lamented, with satirical emphasis, the absence of an intelligent\r\ncompanion of her own sex; and stretched her majestic figure on the sofa\r\nto wait until an audience worthy of her flowed in from the dining-room.\r\nBefore very long--so soothing is the influence of an after-dinner\r\nview of feudal antiquities, taken through the medium of an approving\r\nconscience--Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s eyes closed; and from Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s nose\r\nthere poured, at intervals, a sound, deep like her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s learning;\r\nregular, like her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s habits--a sound associated with nightcaps\r\nand bedrooms, evoked alike by Nature, the leveler, from high and\r\nlow--the sound (oh, Truth what enormities find publicity in thy\r\nname!)--the sound of a Snore.\r\n\r\nFree to do as she pleased, Blanche left the echoes of the drawing-room\r\nin undisturbed enjoyment of Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s audible repose.\r\n\r\nShe went into the library, and turned over the novels. Went out again,\r\nand looked across the hall at the dining-room door. Would the men never\r\nhave done talking their politics and drinking their wine? She went up to\r\nher own room, and changed her ear-rings, and scolded her maid. Descended\r\nonce more--and made an alarming discovery in a dark corner of the hall.\r\n\r\nTwo men were standing there, hat in hand whispering to the butler. The\r\nbutler, leaving them, went into the dining-room--came out again with Sir\r\nPatrick--and said to the two men, \xe2\x80\x9cStep this way, please.\xe2\x80\x9d The two men\r\ncame out into the light. Murdoch, the station-master; and Duncan, the\r\nvalet! News of Anne!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, uncle, let me stay!\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Blanche.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick hesitated. It was impossible to say--as matters stood at\r\nthat moment--what distressing intelligence the two men might not have\r\nbrought of the missing woman. Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s return, accompanied by the\r\nstation-master, looked serious. Blanche instantly penetrated the secret\r\nof her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation. She turned pale, and caught him by the\r\narm. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t send me away,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cI can bear any thing but\r\nsuspense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut with it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick, holding his niece\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x9cIs she found\r\nor not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s gone by the up-train,\xe2\x80\x9d said the station-master. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we know\r\nwhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick breathed freely; Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s color came back. In different\r\nways, the relief to both of them was equally great.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had my orders to follow her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick to Duncan. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy have\r\nyou come back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour man is not to blame, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the station-master. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nlady took the train at Kirkandrew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick started and looked at the station-master. \xe2\x80\x9cAy? ay? The next\r\nstation--the market-town. Inexcusably stupid of me. I never thought of\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took the liberty of telegraphing your description of the lady to\r\nKirkandrew, Sir Patrick, in case of accidents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI stand corrected, Mr. Murdoch. Your head, in this matter, has been the\r\nsharper head of the two. Well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the answer, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick and Blanche read the telegram together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKirkandrew. Up train. 7.40 P.M. Lady as described. No luggage. Bag in\r\nher hand. Traveling alone. Ticket--second-class. Place--Edinburgh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdinburgh!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, uncle! we shall lose her in a great\r\nplace like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall find her, my dear; and you shall see how. Duncan, get me\r\npen, ink, and paper. Mr. Murdoch, you are going back to the station, I\r\nsuppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will give you a telegram, to be sent at once to Edinburgh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wrote a carefully-worded telegraphic message, and addressed it to The\r\nSheriff of Mid-Lothian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Sheriff is an old friend of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained to his niece. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nhe is now in Edinburgh. Long before the train gets to the terminus\r\nhe will receive this personal description of Miss Silvester, with my\r\nrequest to have all her movements carefully watched till further notice.\r\nThe police are entirely at his disposal; and the best men will be\r\nselected for the purpose. I have asked for an answer by telegraph. Keep\r\na special messenger ready for it at the station, Mr. Murdoch. Thank you;\r\ngood-evening. Duncan, get your supper, and make yourself comfortable.\r\nBlanche, my dear, go back to the drawing-room, and expect us in to tea\r\nimmediately. You will know where your friend is before you go to bed\r\nto-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those comforting words he returned to the gentlemen. In ten minutes\r\nmore they all appeared in the drawing-room; and Lady Lundie (firmly\r\npersuaded that she had never closed her eyes) was back again in baronial\r\nScotland five hundred years since.\r\n\r\nBlanche, watching her opportunity, caught her uncle alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow for your promise,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have made some important\r\ndiscoveries at Craig Fernie. What are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s eye turned toward Geoffrey, dozing in an arm-chair in a\r\ncorner of the room. He showed a certain disposition to trifle with the\r\ncuriosity of his niece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the discovery we have already made,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t you wait, my\r\ndear, till we get the telegram from Edinburgh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is just what it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible for me to do! The telegram won\xe2\x80\x99t come\r\nfor hours yet. I want something to go on with in the mean time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seated herself on a sofa in the corner opposite Geoffrey, and\r\npointed to the vacant place by her side.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick had promised--Sir Patrick had no choice but to keep his\r\nword. After another look at Geoffrey, he took the vacant place by his\r\nniece.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE TWENTY-FOURTH.\r\n\r\nBACKWARD.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWELL?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Blanche, taking her uncle confidentially by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick, with a spark of his satirical humor flashing\r\nout at his niece, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to do a very rash thing. I am going to\r\nplace a serious trust in the hands of a girl of eighteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe girl\xe2\x80\x99s hands will keep it, uncle--though she _is_ only eighteen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must run the risk, my dear; your intimate knowledge of Miss Silvester\r\nmay be of the greatest assistance to me in the next step I take. You\r\nshall know all that I can tell you, but I must warn you first. I\r\ncan only admit you into my confidence by startling you with a great\r\nsurprise. Do you follow me, so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you fail to control yourself, you place an obstacle in the way of\r\nmy being of some future use to Miss Silvester. Remember that, and now\r\nprepare for the surprise. What did I tell you before dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said you had made discoveries at Craig Fernie. What have you found\r\nout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have found out that there is a certain person who is in full\r\npossession of the information which Miss Silvester has concealed from\r\nyou and from me. The person is within our reach. The person is in this\r\nneighborhood. The person is in this room!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe caught up Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s hand, resting on his arm, and pressed it\r\nsignificantly. She looked at him with the cry of surprise suspended\r\non her lips--waited a little with her eyes fixed on Fir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface--struggled resolutely, and composed herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoint the person out.\xe2\x80\x9d She said the words with a self-possession which\r\nwon her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s hearty approval. Blanche had done wonders for a girl in\r\nher teens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick; \xe2\x80\x9cand tell me what you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see Lady Lundie, at the other end of the room, with the map of\r\nPerthshire and the Baronial Antiquities of Scotland on the table. And I\r\nsee every body but you and me obliged to listen to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery body?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche looked carefully round the room, and noticed Geoffrey in the\r\nopposite corner; fast asleep by this time in his arm-chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle! you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is the man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Delamayn--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Delamayn knows every thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche held mechanically by her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and looked at the sleeping\r\nman as if her eyes could never see enough of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw me in the library in private consultation with Mr. Delamayn,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n resumed Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cI have to acknowledge, my dear, that you were\r\nquite right in thinking this a suspicious circumstance, And I am now\r\nto justify myself for having purposely kept you in the dark up to the\r\npresent time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those introductory words, he briefly reverted to the earlier\r\noccurrences of the day, and then added, by way of commentary, a\r\nstatement of the conclusions which events had suggested to his own mind.\r\n\r\nThe events, it may be remembered, were three in number. First,\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s private conference with Sir Patrick on the subject of\r\nIrregular Marriages in Scotland. Secondly, Anne Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s appearance\r\nat Windygates. Thirdly, Anne\xe2\x80\x99s flight.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions which had thereupon suggested themselves to Sir\r\nPatrick\xe2\x80\x99s mind were six in number.\r\n\r\nFirst, that a connection of some sort might possibly exist between\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledged difficulty about his friend, and Miss\r\nSilvester\xe2\x80\x99s presumed difficulty about herself. Secondly, that Geoffrey\r\nhad really put to Sir Patrick--not his own case--but the case of a\r\nfriend. Thirdly, that Geoffrey had some interest (of no harmless kind)\r\nin establishing the fact of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s marriage. Fourthly, that Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanxiety (as described by Blanche) to hear the names of the gentlemen who\r\nwere staying at Windygates, pointed, in all probability, to Geoffrey.\r\nFifthly, that this last inference disturbed the second conclusion, and\r\nreopened the doubt whether Geoffrey had not been stating his own case,\r\nafter all, under pretense of stating the case of a friend. Sixthly, that\r\nthe one way of obtaining any enlightenment on this point, and on all the\r\nother points involved in mystery, was to go to Craig Fernie, and consult\r\nMrs. Inchbare\xe2\x80\x99s experience during the period of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s residence at the\r\ninn. Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s apology for keeping all this a secret from his niece\r\nfollowed. He had shrunk from agitating her on the subject until he\r\ncould be sure of proving his conclusions to be true. The proof had been\r\nobtained; and he was now, therefore, ready to open his mind to Blanche\r\nwithout reserve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cfor those necessary\r\nexplanations which are also the necessary nuisances of human\r\nintercourse. You now know as much as I did when I arrived at Craig\r\nFernie--and you are, therefore, in a position to appreciate the value of\r\nmy discoveries at the inn. Do you understand every thing, so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. I drove up to the inn; and--behold me closeted with Mrs.\r\nInchbare in her own private parlor! (My reputation may or may not\r\nsuffer, but Mrs. Inchbare\xe2\x80\x99s bones are above suspicion!) It was a long\r\nbusiness, Blanche. A more sour-tempered, cunning, and distrustful\r\nwitness I never examined in all my experience at the Bar. She would have\r\nupset the temper of any mortal man but a lawyer. We have such wonderful\r\ntempers in our profession; and we can be so aggravating when we like! In\r\nshort, my dear, Mrs. Inchbare was a she-cat, and I was a he-cat--and I\r\nclawed the truth out of her at last. The result was well worth\r\narriving at, as you shall see. Mr. Delamayn had described to me certain\r\nremarkable circumstances as taking place between a lady and a gentleman\r\nat an inn: the object of the parties being to pass themselves off at\r\nthe time as man and wife. Every one of those circumstances, Blanche,\r\noccurred at Craig Fernie, between a lady and a gentleman, on the day\r\nwhen Miss Silvester disappeared from this house And--wait!--being\r\npressed for her name, after the gentleman had left her behind him at the\r\ninn, the name the lady gave was, \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Silvester.\xe2\x80\x99 What do you think of\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink! I\xe2\x80\x99m bewildered--I can\xe2\x80\x99t realize it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a startling discovery, my dear child--there is no denying that.\r\nShall I wait a little, and let you recover yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! no! Go on! The gentleman, uncle? The gentleman who was with Anne?\r\nWho is he? Not Mr. Delamayn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot Mr. Delamayn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I have proved nothing else, I\r\nhave proved that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat need was there to prove it? Mr. Delamayn went to London on the day\r\nof the lawn-party. And Arnold--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Arnold went with him as far as the second station from this. Quite\r\ntrue! But how was I to know what Mr. Delamayn might have done after\r\nArnold had left him? I could only make sure that he had not gone back\r\nprivately to the inn, by getting the proof from Mrs. Inchbare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you get it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked her to describe the gentleman who was with Miss Silvester.\r\nMrs. Inchbare\xe2\x80\x99s description (vague as you will presently find it to be)\r\ncompletely exonerates that man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick, pointing to Geoffrey\r\nstill asleep in his chair. \xe2\x80\x9c_He_ is not the person who passed Miss\r\nSilvester off as his wife at Craig Fernie. He spoke the truth when he\r\ndescribed the case to me as the case of a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who is the friend?\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to know, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me exactly, uncle, what Mrs. Inchbare said. I have lived with Anne\r\nall my life. I _must_ have seen the man somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can identify him by Mrs. Inchbare\xe2\x80\x99s description,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nSir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will be a great deal cleverer than I am. Here is the\r\npicture of the man, as painted by the landlady: Young; middle-sized;\r\ndark hair, eyes, and complexion; nice temper, pleasant way of speaking.\r\nLeave out \xe2\x80\x98young,\xe2\x80\x99 and the rest is the exact contrary of Mr. Delamayn.\r\nSo far, Mrs. Inchbare guides us plainly enough. But how are we to\r\napply her description to the right person? There must be, at the\r\nlowest computation, five hundred thousand men in England who are young,\r\nmiddle-sized, dark, nice-tempered, and pleasant spoken. One of the\r\nfootmen here answers that description in every particular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Arnold answers it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche--as a still stronger instance of\r\nthe provoking vagueness of the description.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Arnold answers it,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Sir Patrick, quite agreeing with her.\r\n\r\nThey had barely said those words when Arnold himself appeared,\r\napproaching Sir Patrick with a pack of cards in his hand.\r\n\r\nThere--at the very moment when they had both guessed the truth, without\r\nfeeling the slightest suspicion of it in their own minds--there stood\r\nDiscovery, presenting itself unconsciously to eyes incapable of seeing\r\nit, in the person of the man who had passed Anne Silvester off as\r\nhis wife at the Craig Fernie inn! The terrible caprice of Chance, the\r\nmerciless irony of Circumstance, could go no further than this. The\r\nthree had their feet on the brink of the precipice at that moment. And\r\ntwo of them were smiling at an odd coincidence; and one of them was\r\nshuffling a pack of cards!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have done with the Antiquities at last!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold; \xe2\x80\x9cand we are\r\ngoing to play at Whist. Sir Patrick, will you choose a card?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo soon after dinner, my good fellow, for _me_. Play the first rubber,\r\nand then give me another chance. By-the-way,\xe2\x80\x9d he added \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Silvester\r\nhas been traced to Kirkandrew. How is it that you never saw her go by?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe can\xe2\x80\x99t have gone my way, Sir Patrick, or I must have seen her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving justified himself in those terms, he was recalled to the other\r\nend of the room by the whist-party, impatient for the cards which he had\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were we talking of when he interrupted us?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick to\r\nBlanche.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the man, uncle, who was with Miss Silvester at the inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s useless to pursue that inquiry, my dear, with nothing better than\r\nMrs. Inchbare\xe2\x80\x99s description to help us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche looked round at the sleeping Geoffrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _he_ knows!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s maddening, uncle, to look at the brute\r\nsnoring in his chair!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick held up a warning hand. Before a word more could be said\r\nbetween them they were silenced again by another interruption.\r\n\r\nThe whist-party comprised Lady Lundie and the surgeon, playing as\r\npartners against Smith and Jones. Arnold sat behind the surgeon, taking\r\na lesson in the game. One, Two, and Three, thus left to their own\r\ndevices, naturally thought of the billiard-table; and, detecting\r\nGeoffrey asleep in his corner, advanced to disturb his slumbers, under\r\nthe all-sufficing apology of \xe2\x80\x9cPool.\xe2\x80\x9d Geoffrey roused himself, and rubbed\r\nhis eyes, and said, drowsily, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d As he rose, he looked at\r\nthe opposite corner in which Sir Patrick and his niece were sitting.\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s self-possession, resolutely as she struggled to preserve it,\r\nwas not strong enough to keep her eyes from turning toward Geoffrey with\r\nan expression which betrayed the reluctant interest that she now felt in\r\nhim. He stopped, noticing something entirely new in the look with which\r\nthe young lady was regarding him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish to speak to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s face flushed all over. Her uncle came to the rescue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Lundie and I hope you have slept well Mr. Delamayn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir\r\nPatrick, jocosely. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh? That\xe2\x80\x99s all?\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey still looking at Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cBeg your\r\npardon again. Deuced long walk, and deuced heavy dinner. Natural\r\nconsequence--a nap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick eyed him closely. It was plain that he had been honestly\r\npuzzled at finding himself an object of special attention on Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart. \xe2\x80\x9cSee you in the billiard-room?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, carelessly, and followed\r\nhis companions out of the room--as usual, without waiting for an answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind what you are about,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick to his niece. \xe2\x80\x9cThat man is\r\nquicker than he looks. We commit a serious mistake if we put him on his\r\nguard at starting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t happen again, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cBut think of _his_\r\nbeing in Anne\xe2\x80\x99s confidence, and of _my_ being shut out of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn his friend\xe2\x80\x99s confidence, you mean, my dear; and (if we only avoid\r\nawakening his suspicion) there is no knowing how soon he may say or do\r\nsomething which may show us who his friend is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he is going back to his brother\xe2\x80\x99s to-morrow--he said so at\r\ndinner-time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better. He will be out of the way of seeing strange things\r\nin a certain young lady\xe2\x80\x99s face. His brother\xe2\x80\x99s house is within easy reach\r\nof this; and I am his legal adviser. My experience tells me that he has\r\nnot done consulting me yet--and that he will let out something more\r\nnext time. So much for our chance of seeing the light through Mr.\r\nDelamayn--if we can\xe2\x80\x99t see it in any other way. And that is not our only\r\nchance, remember. I have something to tell you about Bishopriggs and the\r\nlost letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it found?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I satisfied myself about that--I had it searched for, under my own\r\neye. The letter is stolen, Blanche; and Bishopriggs has got it. I have\r\nleft a line for him, in Mrs. Inchbare\xe2\x80\x99s care. The old rascal is missed\r\nalready by the visitors at the inn, just as I told you he would be. His\r\nmistress is feeling the penalty of having been fool enough to vent her\r\nill temper on her head-waiter. She lays the whole blame of the quarrel\r\non Miss Silvester, of course. Bishopriggs neglected every body at\r\nthe inn to wait on Miss Silvester. Bishopriggs was insolent on being\r\nremonstrated with, and Miss Silvester encouraged him--and so on. The\r\nresult will be--now Miss Silvester has gone--that Bishopriggs will\r\nreturn to Craig Fernie before the autumn is over. We are sailing with\r\nwind and tide, my dear. Come, and learn to play whist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe rose to join the card-players. Blanche detained him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t told me one thing yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhoever the man may be,\r\nis Anne married to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever the man may be,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9che had better not\r\nattempt to marry any body else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the niece unconsciously put the question, and so the uncle\r\nunconsciously gave the answer on which depended the whole happiness of\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s life to come, The \xe2\x80\x9cman!\xe2\x80\x9d How lightly they both talked of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cman!\xe2\x80\x9d Would nothing happen to rouse the faintest suspicion--in their\r\nminds or in Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s mind--that Arnold was the \xe2\x80\x9cman\xe2\x80\x9d himself?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that she _is_ married?\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t go as far as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that she is _not_ married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t go so far as _that._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! the law!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProvoking, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, my dear? I can tell you, professionally, that (in\r\nmy opinion) she has grounds to go on if she claims to be the man\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\nThat is what I meant by my answer; and, until we know more, that is all\r\nI can say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen shall we know more? When shall we get the telegram?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for some hours yet. Come, and learn to play whist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I would rather talk to Arnold, uncle, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy all means! But don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to him about what I have been telling you\r\nto-night. He and Mr. Delamayn are old associates, remember; and he might\r\nblunder into telling his friend what his friend had better not know. Sad\r\n(isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?) for me to be instilling these lessons of duplicity into the\r\nyouthful mind. A wise person once said, \xe2\x80\x98The older a man gets the\r\nworse he gets.\xe2\x80\x99 That wise person, my dear, had me in his eye, and was\r\nperfectly right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe mitigated the pain of that confession with a pinch of snuff, and went\r\nto the whist table to wait until the end of the rubber gave him a place\r\nat the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIFTH.\r\n\r\nFORWARD.\r\n\r\nBLANCHE found her lover as attentive as usual to her slightest wish, but\r\nnot in his customary good spirits. He pleaded fatigue, after his long\r\nwatch at the cross-roads, as an excuse for his depression. As long as\r\nthere was any hope of a reconciliation with Geoffrey, he was unwilling\r\nto tell Blanche what had happened that afternoon. The hope grew fainter\r\nand fainter as the evening advanced. Arnold purposely suggested a\r\nvisit to the billiard-room, and joined the game, with Blanche, to give\r\nGeoffrey an opportunity of saying the few gracious words which would\r\nhave made them friends again. Geoffrey never spoke the words; he\r\nobstinately ignored Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s presence in the room.\r\n\r\nAt the card-table the whist went on interminably. Lady Lundie, Sir\r\nPatrick, and the surgeon, were all inveterate players, evenly matched.\r\nSmith and Jones (joining the game alternately) were aids to whist,\r\nexactly as they were aids to conversation. The same safe and modest\r\nmediocrity of style distinguished the proceedings of these two gentlemen\r\nin all the affairs of life.\r\n\r\nThe time wore on to midnight. They went to bed late and they rose late\r\nat Windygates House. Under that hospitable roof, no intrusive hints, in\r\nthe shape of flat candlesticks exhibiting themselves with ostentatious\r\nvirtue on side-tables, hurried the guest to his room; no vile bell\r\nrang him ruthlessly out of bed the next morning, and insisted on his\r\nbreakfasting at a given hour. Life has surely hardships enough that\r\nare inevitable without gratuitously adding the hardship of absolute\r\ngovernment, administered by a clock?\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter past twelve when Lady Lundie rose blandly from the\r\nwhist-table, and said that she supposed somebody must set the example of\r\ngoing to bed. Sir Patrick and Smith, the surgeon and Jones, agreed on a\r\nlast rubber. Blanche vanished while her stepmother\xe2\x80\x99s eye was on her;\r\nand appeared again in the drawing-room, when Lady Lundie was safe in the\r\nhands of her maid. Nobody followed the example of the mistress of the\r\nhouse but Arnold. He left the billiard-room with the certainty that it\r\nwas all over now between Geoffrey and himself. Not even the attraction\r\nof Blanche proved strong enough to detain him that night. He went his\r\nway to bed.\r\n\r\nIt was past one o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The final rubber was at an end, the accounts\r\nwere settled at the card-table; the surgeon had strolled into the\r\nbilliard-room, and Smith and Jones had followed him, when Duncan came\r\nin, at last, with the telegram in his hand.\r\n\r\nBlanche turned from the broad, calm autumn moonlight which had drawn her\r\nto the window, and looked over her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder while he opened the\r\ntelegram.\r\n\r\nShe read the first line--and that was enough. The whole scaffolding of\r\nhope built round that morsel of paper fell to the ground in an instant.\r\nThe train from Kirkandrew had reached Edinburgh at the usual time. Every\r\npassenger in it had passed under the eyes of the police, and nothing had\r\nbeen seen of any person who answered the description given of Anne!\r\n\r\nSir Patrick pointed to the two last sentences in the telegram:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInquiries telegraphed to Falkirk. If with any result, you shall know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must hope for the best, Blanche. They evidently suspect her of\r\nhaving got out at the junction of the two railways for the purpose\r\nof giving the telegraph the slip. There is no help for it. Go to bed,\r\nchild--go to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche kissed her uncle in silence and went away. The bright young face\r\nwas sad with the first hopeless sorrow which the old man had yet seen in\r\nit. His niece\xe2\x80\x99s parting look dwelt painfully on his mind when he was up\r\nin his room, with the faithful Duncan getting him ready for his bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a bad business, Duncan. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to say so to Miss Lundie;\r\nbut I greatly fear the governess has baffled us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems likely, Sir Patrick. The poor young lady looks quite\r\nheart-broken about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou noticed that too, did you? She has lived all her life, you see,\r\nwith Miss Silvester; and there is a very strong attachment between them.\r\nI am uneasy about my niece, Duncan. I am afraid this disappointment will\r\nhave a serious effect on her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s young, Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my friend, she\xe2\x80\x99s young; but the young (when they are good for any\r\nthing) have warm hearts. Winter hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stolen on _them,_ Duncan! And\r\nthey feel keenly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think there\xe2\x80\x99s reason to hope, Sir, that Miss Lundie may get over it\r\nmore easily than you suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat reason, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA person in my position can hardly venture to speak freely, Sir, on a\r\ndelicate matter of this kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s temper flashed out, half-seriously, half-whimsically, as\r\nusual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that a snap at Me, you old dog? If I am not your friend, as well as\r\nyour master, who is? Am _I_ in the habit of keeping any of my harmless\r\nfellow-creatures at a distance? I despise the cant of modern Liberalism;\r\nbut it\xe2\x80\x99s not the less true that I have, all my life, protested against\r\nthe inhuman separation of classes in England. We are, in that respect,\r\nbrag as we may of our national virtue, the most unchristian people in\r\nthe civilized world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Sir Patrick--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod help me! I\xe2\x80\x99m talking polities at this time of night! It\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nfault, Duncan. What do you mean by casting my station in my teeth,\r\nbecause I can\xe2\x80\x99t put my night-cap on comfortably till you have brushed\r\nmy hair? I have a good mind to get up and brush yours. There! there! I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nuneasy about my niece--nervous irritability, my good fellow, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s hear what you have to say about Miss Lundie. And go on with my\r\nhair. And don\xe2\x80\x99t be a humbug.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was about to remind you, Sir Patrick, that Miss Lundie has another\r\ninterest in her life to turn to. If this matter of Miss Silvester ends\r\nbadly--and I own it begins to look as if it would--I should hurry my\r\nniece\xe2\x80\x99s marriage, Sir, and see if _that_ wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t console her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick started under the gentle discipline of the hair-brush in\r\nDuncan\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s very sensibly put,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cDuncan! you are,\r\nwhat I call, a clear-minded man. Well worth thinking of, old Truepenny!\r\nIf the worst comes to the worst, well worth thinking of!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time that Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s steady good sense had struck\r\nlight, under the form of a new thought, in his master\xe2\x80\x99s mind. But never\r\nyet had he wrought such mischief as the mischief which he had innocently\r\ndone now. He had sent Sir Patrick to bed with the fatal idea of\r\nhastening the marriage of Arnold and Blanche.\r\n\r\nThe situation of affairs at Windygates--now that Anne had apparently\r\nobliterated all trace of herself--was becoming serious. The one chance\r\non which the discovery of Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s position depended, was the chance\r\nthat accident might reveal the truth in the lapse of time. In this\r\nposture of circumstances, Sir Patrick now resolved--if nothing happened\r\nto relieve Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety in the course of the week--to advance the\r\ncelebration of the marriage from the end of the autumn (as originally\r\ncontemplated) to the first fortnight of the ensuing month. As dates\r\nthen stood, the change led (so far as free scope for the development of\r\naccident was concerned) to this serious result. It abridged a lapse of\r\nthree months into an interval of three weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning came; and Blanche marked it as a memorable morning,\r\nby committing an act of imprudence, which struck away one more of\r\nthe chances of discovery that had existed, before the arrival of the\r\nEdinburgh telegram on the previous day.\r\n\r\nShe had passed a sleepless night; fevered in mind and body; thinking,\r\nhour after hour, of nothing but Anne. At sunrise she could endure it no\r\nlonger. Her power to control herself was completely exhausted; her own\r\nimpulses led her as they pleased. She got up, determined not to let\r\nGeoffrey leave the house without risking an effort to make him reveal\r\nwhat he knew about Anne. It was nothing less than downright treason to\r\nSir Patrick to act on her own responsibility in this way. She knew it\r\nwas wrong; she was heartily ashamed of herself for doing it. But the\r\ndemon that possesses women with a recklessness all their own, at the\r\ncritical moments of their lives, had got her--and she did it.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey had arranged overnight, to breakfast early, by himself, and to\r\nwalk the ten miles to his brother\xe2\x80\x99s house; sending a servant to fetch\r\nhis luggage later in the day.\r\n\r\nHe had got on his hat; he was standing in the hall, searching his pocket\r\nfor his second self, the pipe--when Blanche suddenly appeared from the\r\nmorning-room, and placed herself between him and the house door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp early--eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m off to my brother\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made no reply. He looked at her closer. The girl\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were trying\r\nto read his face, with an utter carelessness of concealment, which\r\nforbade (even to his mind) all unworthy interpretation of her motive for\r\nstopping him on his way out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny commands for me?\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired\r\n\r\nThis time she answered him. \xe2\x80\x9cI have something to ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHe smiled graciously, and opened his tobacco-pouch. He was fresh and\r\nstrong after his night\xe2\x80\x99s sleep--healthy and handsome and good-humored.\r\nThe house-maids had had a peep at him that morning, and had wished--like\r\nDesdemona, with a difference--that \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven had made all three of them\r\nsuch a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe put her question, without a single word of preface--purposely to\r\nsurprise him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Delamayn,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know where Anne Silvester is this\r\nmorning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was filling his pipe as she spoke, and he dropped some of the tobacco\r\non the floor. Instead of answering before he picked up the tobacco he\r\nanswered after--in surly self-possession, and in one word--\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know nothing about her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe devoted himself doggedly to the filling of his pipe. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn your word of honor, as a gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my word of honor, as a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put back his tobacco-pouch in his pocket. His handsome face was as\r\nhard as stone. His clear blue eyes defied all the girls in England put\r\ntogether to see into _his_ mind. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you done, Miss Lundie?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked,\r\nsuddenly changing to a bantering politeness of tone and manner.\r\n\r\nBlanche saw that it was hopeless--saw that she had compromised her own\r\ninterests by her own headlong act. Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s warning words came\r\nback reproachfully to her now when it was too late. \xe2\x80\x9cWe commit a serious\r\nmistake if we put him on his guard at starting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was but one course to take now. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy turn now,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to know where Miss Silvester\r\nis. Why do you ask Me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche did all that could be done toward repairing the error that she\r\nhad committed. She kept Geoffrey as far away as Geoffrey had kept _her_\r\nfrom the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI happen to know,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied \xe2\x80\x9cthat Miss Silvester left the place\r\nat which she had been staying about the time when you went out walking\r\nyesterday. And I thought you might have seen her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh? That\xe2\x80\x99s the reason--is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey, with a smile.\r\n\r\nThe smile stung Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s sensitive temper to the quick. She made a\r\nfinal effort to control herself, before her indignation got the better\r\nof her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no more to say, Mr. Delamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d With that reply she turned her\r\nback on him, and closed the door of the morning-room between them.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey descended the house steps and lit his pipe. He was not at the\r\nslightest loss, on this occasion, to account for what had happened. He\r\nassumed at once that Arnold had taken a mean revenge on him after his\r\nconduct of the day before, and had told the whole secret of his errand\r\nat Craig Fernie to Blanche. The thing would get next, no doubt, to Sir\r\nPatrick\xe2\x80\x99s ears; and Sir Patrick would thereupon be probably the first\r\nperson who revealed to Arnold the position in which he had placed\r\nhimself with Anne. All right! Sir Patrick would be an excellent witness\r\nto appeal to, when the scandal broke out, and when the time came for\r\nrepudiating Anne\xe2\x80\x99s claim on him as the barefaced imposture of a woman\r\nwho was married already to another man. He puffed away unconcernedly at\r\nhis pipe, and started, at his swinging, steady pace, for his brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nBlanche remained alone in the morning-room. The prospect of getting at\r\nthe truth, by means of what Geoffrey might say on the next occasion when\r\nhe consulted Sir Patrick, was a prospect that she herself had closed\r\nfrom that moment. She sat down in despair by the window. It commanded a\r\nview of the little side-terrace which had been Anne\xe2\x80\x99s favorite walk at\r\nWindygates. With weary eyes and aching heart the poor child looked at\r\nthe familiar place; and asked herself, with the bitter repentance that\r\ncomes too late, if she had destroyed the last chance of finding Anne!\r\n\r\nShe sat passively at the window, while the hours of the morning wore on,\r\nuntil the postman came. Before the servant could take the letter bag she\r\nwas in the hall to receive it. Was it possible to hope that the bag had\r\nbrought tidings of Anne? She sorted the letters; and lighted suddenly\r\non a letter to herself. It bore the Kirkandrew postmark, and It was\r\naddressed to her in Anne\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting.\r\n\r\nShe tore the letter open, and read these lines:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have left you forever, Blanche. God bless and reward you! God make\r\nyou a happy woman in all your life to come! Cruel as you will think me,\r\nlove, I have never been so truly your sister as I am now. I can only\r\ntell you this--I can never tell you more. Forgive me, and forget me, our\r\nlives are parted lives from this day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoing down to breakfast about his usual hour, Sir Patrick missed\r\nBlanche, whom he was accustomed to see waiting for him at the table at\r\nthat time. The room was empty; the other members of the household having\r\nall finished their morning meal. Sir Patrick disliked breakfasting\r\nalone. He sent Duncan with a message, to be given to Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s maid.\r\n\r\nThe maid appeared in due time Miss Lundie was unable to leave her room.\r\nShe sent a letter to her uncle, with her love--and begged he would read\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick opened the letter and saw what Anne had written to Blanche.\r\n\r\nHe waited a little, reflecting, with evident pain and anxiety, on what\r\nhe had read--then opened his own letters, and hurriedly looked at the\r\nsignatures. There was nothing for him from his friend, the sheriff,\r\nat Edinburgh, and no communication from the railway, in the shape of a\r\ntelegram. He had decided, overnight, on waiting till the end of the week\r\nbefore he interfered in the matter of Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s marriage. The events of\r\nthe morning determined him on not waiting another day. Duncan returned\r\nto the breakfast-room to pour out his master\xe2\x80\x99s coffee. Sir Patrick sent\r\nhim away again with a second message,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know where Lady Lundie is, Duncan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy compliments to her ladyship. If she is not otherwise engaged, I\r\nshall be glad to speak to her privately in an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE TWENTY-SIXTH.\r\n\r\nDROPPED.\r\n\r\nSIR PATRICK made a bad breakfast. Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s absence fretted him, and\r\nAnne Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s letter puzzled him.\r\n\r\nHe read it, short as it was, a second time, and a third. If it meant any\r\nthing, it meant that the motive at the bottom of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s flight was to\r\naccomplish the sacrifice of herself to the happiness of Blanche. She had\r\nparted for life from his niece for his niece\xe2\x80\x99s sake! What did this mean?\r\nAnd how was it to be reconciled with Anne\xe2\x80\x99s position--as described to\r\nhim by Mrs. Inchbare during his visit to Craig Fernie?\r\n\r\nAll Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s ingenuity, and all Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s experience, failed to\r\nfind so much as the shadow of an answer to that question.\r\n\r\nWhile he was still pondering over the letter, Arnold and the surgeon\r\nentered the breakfast-room together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard about Blanche?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arnold, excitedly. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is in no\r\ndanger, Sir Patrick--the worst of it is over now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe surgeon interposed before Sir Patrick could appeal to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Brinkworth\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the young lady a little exaggerates the\r\nstate of the case,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen her, at Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s request;\r\nand I can assure you that there is not the slightest reason for any\r\npresent alarm. Miss Lundie has had a nervous attack, which has yielded\r\nto the simplest domestic remedies. The only anxiety you need feel is\r\nconnected with the management of her in the future. She is suffering\r\nfrom some mental distress, which it is not for me, but for her friends,\r\nto alleviate and remove. If you can turn her thoughts from the painful\r\nsubject--whatever it may be--on which they are dwelling now, you will do\r\nall that needs to be done.\xe2\x80\x9d He took up a newspaper from the table, and\r\nstrolled out into the garden, leaving Sir Patrick and Arnold together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou heard that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he right, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arnold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight? Do you suppose a man gets _his_ reputation by making mistakes?\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re one of the new generation, Master Arnold. You can all of you\r\nstare at a famous man; but you haven\xe2\x80\x99t an atom of respect for his fame.\r\nIf Shakspeare came to life again, and talked of playwriting, the first\r\npretentious nobody who sat opposite at dinner would differ with him as\r\ncomposedly as he might differ with you and me. Veneration is dead among\r\nus; the present age has buried it, without a stone to mark the place. So\r\nmuch for that! Let\xe2\x80\x99s get back to Blanche. I suppose you can guess what\r\nthe painful subject is that\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling on her mind? Miss Silvester has\r\nbaffled me, and baffled the Edinburgh police. Blanche discovered that we\r\nhad failed last night and Blanche received that letter this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pushed Anne\xe2\x80\x99s letter across the breakfast-table.\r\n\r\nArnold read it, and handed it back without a word. Viewed by the new\r\nlight in which he saw Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s character after the quarrel on the\r\nheath, the letter conveyed but one conclusion to his mind. Geoffrey had\r\ndeserted her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you understand what it means?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s wretchedness when she read it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said no more than that. It was plain that no information which he\r\ncould afford--even if he had considered himself at liberty to give\r\nit--would be of the slightest use in assisting Sir Patrick to trace\r\nMiss Silvester, under present circumstances, There was--unhappily--no\r\ntemptation to induce him to break the honorable silence which he\r\nhad maintained thus far. And--more unfortunately still--assuming the\r\ntemptation to present itself, Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to resist it had never\r\nbeen so strong a capacity as it was now.\r\n\r\nTo the two powerful motives which had hitherto tied his tongue--respect\r\nfor Anne\xe2\x80\x99s reputation, and reluctance to reveal to Blanche the deception\r\nwhich he had been compelled to practice on her at the inn--to these\r\ntwo motives there was now added a third. The meanness of betraying the\r\nconfidence which Geoffrey had reposed in him would be doubled meanness\r\nif he proved false to his trust after Geoffrey had personally insulted\r\nhim. The paltry revenge which that false friend had unhesitatingly\r\nsuspected him of taking was a revenge of which Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s nature was\r\nsimply incapable. Never had his lips been more effectually sealed\r\nthan at this moment--when his whole future depended on Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndiscovering the part that he had played in past events at Craig Fernie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! yes!\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Sir Patrick, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s distress is\r\nintelligible enough. But here is my niece apparently answerable for this\r\nunhappy woman\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance. Can you explain what my niece has got to\r\ndo with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI! Blanche herself is completely mystified. How should _I_ know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnswering in those terms, he spoke with perfect sincerity. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s vague\r\ndistrust of the position in which they had innocently placed themselves\r\nat the inn had produced no corresponding effect on Arnold at the time.\r\nHe had not regarded it; he had not even understood it. As a necessary\r\nresult, not the faintest suspicion of the motive under which Anne was\r\nacting existed in his mind now.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick put the letter into his pocket-book, and abandoned all\r\nfurther attempt at interpreting the meaning of it in despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough, and more than enough, of groping in the dark,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOne\r\npoint is clear to me after what has happened up stairs this morning. We\r\nmust accept the position in which Miss Silvester has placed us. I shall\r\ngive up all further effort to trace her from this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely that will be a dreadful disappointment to Blanche, Sir Patrick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it. We must face that result.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are sure there is nothing else to be done, I suppose we must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure of anything of the sort, Master Arnold! There are two\r\nchances still left of throwing light on this matter, which are both of\r\nthem independent of any thing that Miss Silvester can do to keep it in\r\nthe dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why not try them, Sir? It seems hard to drop Miss Silvester when\r\nshe is in trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t help her against her own will,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nwe can\xe2\x80\x99t run the risk, after that nervous attack this morning, of\r\nsubjecting Blanche to any further suspense. I have thought of my niece\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninterests throughout this business; and if I now change my mind, and\r\ndecline to agitate her by more experiments, ending (quite possibly) in\r\nmore failures, it is because I am thinking of her interests still. I\r\nhave no other motive. However numerous my weaknesses may be, ambition\r\nto distinguish myself as a detective policeman is not one of them. The\r\ncase, from the police point of view, is by no means a lost case. I\r\ndrop it, nevertheless, for Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s sake. Instead of encouraging her\r\nthoughts to dwell on this melancholy business, we must apply the remedy\r\nsuggested by our medical friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is that to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arnold.\r\n\r\nThe sly twist of humor began to show itself in Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas she nothing to think of in the future, which is a pleasanter\r\nsubject of reflection than the loss of her friend?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are\r\ninterested, my young gentleman, in the remedy that is to cure Blanche.\r\nYou are one of the drugs in the moral prescription. Can you guess what\r\nit is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold started to his feet, and brightened into a new being.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you object to be hurried?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObject! If Blanche will only consent, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take her to church as soon\r\nas she comes down stairs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick, dryly. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Arnold Brinkworth, may you\r\nalways be as ready to take Time by the forelock as you are now! Sit down\r\nagain; and don\xe2\x80\x99t talk nonsense. It is just possible--if Blanche consents\r\n(as you say), and if we can hurry the lawyers--that you may be married\r\nin three weeks\xe2\x80\x99 or a month\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have the lawyers got to do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good fellow, this is not a marriage in a novel! This is the most\r\nunromantic affair of the sort that ever happened. Here are a young\r\ngentleman and a young lady, both rich people; both well matched in birth\r\nand character; one of age, and the other marrying with the full consent\r\nand approval of her guardian. What is the consequence of this purely\r\nprosaic state of things? Lawyers and settlements, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome into the library, Sir Patrick; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll soon settle the\r\nsettlements! A bit of paper, and a dip of ink. \xe2\x80\x98I hereby give every\r\nblessed farthing I have got in the world to my dear Blanche.\xe2\x80\x99 Sign that;\r\nstick a wafer on at the side; clap your finger on the wafer; \xe2\x80\x98I deliver\r\nthis as my act and deed;\xe2\x80\x99 and there it is--done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it, really? You are a born legislator. You create and codify your\r\nown system all in a breath. Moses-Justinian-Mahomet, give me your arm!\r\nThere is one atom of sense in what you have just said. \xe2\x80\x98Come into the\r\nlibrary\xe2\x80\x99--is a suggestion worth attending to. Do you happen, among your\r\nother superfluities, to have such a thing as a lawyer about you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have got two. One in London, and one in Edinburgh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will take the nearest of the two, because we are in a hurry. Who is\r\nthe Edinburgh lawyer? Pringle of Pitt Street? Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a better man.\r\nCome and write to him. You have given me your abstract of a marriage\r\nsettlement with the brevity of an ancient Roman. I scorn to be outdone\r\nby an amateur lawyer. Here is _my_ abstract: You are just and generous\r\nto Blanche; Blanche is just and generous to you; and you both combine\r\nto be just and generous together to your children. There is a model\r\nsettlement! and there are your instructions to Pringle of Pitt Street!\r\nCan you do it by yourself? No; of course you can\xe2\x80\x99t. Now don\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nslovenly-minded! See the points in their order as they come. You are\r\ngoing to be married; you state to whom, you add that I am the lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nguardian; you give the name and address of my lawyer in Edinburgh; you\r\nwrite your instructions plainly in the fewest words, and leave details\r\nto your legal adviser; you refer the lawyers to each other; you request\r\nthat the draft settlements be prepared as speedily as possible, and you\r\ngive your address at this house. There are the heads. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you do it\r\nnow? Oh, the rising generation! Oh, the progress we are making in these\r\nenlightened modern times! There! there! you can marry Blanche, and make\r\nher happy, and increase the population--and all without knowing how\r\nto write the English language. One can only say with the learned\r\nBevorskius, looking out of his window at the illimitable loves of the\r\nsparrows, \xe2\x80\x98How merciful is Heaven to its creatures!\xe2\x80\x99 Take up the pen.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll dictate! I\xe2\x80\x99ll dictate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick read the letter over, approved of it, and saw it safe in the\r\nbox for the post. This done, he peremptorily forbade Arnold to speak to\r\nhis niece on the subject of the marriage without his express permission.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s consent to be got,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbesides Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconsent and mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Lundie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Lundie. Strictly speaking, I am the only authority. But my\r\nsister-in-law is Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s step-mother, and she is appointed guardian in\r\nthe event of my death. She has a right to be consulted--in courtesy, if\r\nnot in law. Would you like to do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s face fell. He looked at Sir Patrick in silent dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you can\xe2\x80\x99t even speak to such a perfectly pliable person as Lady\r\nLundie? You may have been a very useful fellow at sea. A more helpless\r\nyoung man I never met with on shore. Get out with you into the garden\r\namong the other sparrows! Somebody must confront her ladyship. And if\r\nyou won\xe2\x80\x99t--I must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pushed Arnold out of the library, and applied meditatively to the\r\nknob of his cane. His gayety disappeared, now that he was alone. His\r\nexperience of Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s character told him that, in attempting to\r\nwin her approval to any scheme for hurrying Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s marriage, he was\r\nundertaking no easy task. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d mused Sir Patrick, thinking of\r\nhis late brother--\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose poor Tom had some way of managing her. How\r\ndid he do it, I wonder? If she had been the wife of a bricklayer, she\r\nis the sort of woman who would have been kept in perfect order by a\r\nvigorous and regular application of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s fist. But Tom wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\na bricklayer. I wonder how Tom did it?\xe2\x80\x9d After a little hard thinking on\r\nthis point Sir Patrick gave up the problem as beyond human solution. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nmust be done,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd my own mother-wit must help me to do\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn that resigned frame of mind he knocked at the door of Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboudoir.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE TWENTY-SEVENTH.\r\n\r\nOUTWITTED.\r\n\r\nSIR PATRICK found his sister-in-law immersed in domestic business. Her\r\nladyship\xe2\x80\x99s correspondence and visiting list, her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s household\r\nbills and ledgers; her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s Diary and Memorandum-book (bound in\r\nscarlet morocco); her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s desk, envelope-case, match-box, and\r\ntaper candlestick (all in ebony and silver); her ladyship herself,\r\npresiding over her responsibilities, and wielding her materials, equal\r\nto any calls of emergency, beautifully dressed in correct morning\r\ncostume, blessed with perfect health both of the secretions and the\r\nprinciples; absolutely void of vice, and formidably full of virtue,\r\npresented, to every properly-constituted mind, the most imposing\r\nspectacle known to humanity--the British Matron on her throne, asking\r\nthe world in general, When will you produce the like of Me?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I disturb you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a perfectly idle\r\nperson. Shall I look in a little later?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie put her hand to her head, and smiled faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little pressure _here,_ Sir Patrick. Pray sit down. Duty finds me\r\nearnest; Duty finds me cheerful; Duty finds me accessible. From a poor,\r\nweak woman, Duty must expect no more. Now what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d (Her ladyship\r\nconsulted her scarlet memorandum-book.) \xe2\x80\x9cI have got it here, under\r\nits proper head, distinguished by initial letters. P.--the poor.\r\nNo. H.M.--heathen missions. No. V.T.A.--Visitors to arrive. No. P. I.\r\nP.--Here it is: private interview with Patrick. Will you forgive me the\r\nlittle harmless familiarity of omitting your title? Thank you! You are\r\nalways so good. I am quite at your service when you like to begin. If\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s any thing painful, pray don\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate. I am quite prepared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that intimation her ladyship threw herself back in her chair, with\r\nher elbows on the arms, and her fingers joined at the tips, as if\r\nshe was receiving a deputation. \xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, interrogatively. Sir\r\nPatrick paid a private tribute of pity to his late brother\xe2\x80\x99s memory, and\r\nentered on his business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t call it a painful matter,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us say it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter\r\nof domestic anxiety. Blanche--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie emitted a faint scream, and put her hand over her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Must_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried her ladyship, in a tone of touching remonstrance.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Sir Patrick, _must_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I must.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s magnificent eyes looked up at that hidden court of human\r\nappeal which is lodged in the ceiling. The hidden court looked down at\r\nLady Lundie, and saw--Duty advertising itself in the largest capital\r\nletters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, Sir Patrick. The motto of woman is Self-sacrifice. You sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee how you distress me. Go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick went on impenetrably--without betraying the slightest\r\nexpression of sympathy or surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was about to refer to the nervous attack from which Blanche has\r\nsuffered this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask whether you have been\r\ninformed of the cause to which the attack is attributable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lady Lundie with a sudden bound in her chair, and a\r\nsudden development of vocal power to correspond. \xe2\x80\x9cThe one thing I shrank\r\nfrom speaking of! the cruel, cruel, cruel behavior I was prepared to\r\npass over! And Sir Patrick hints on it! Innocently--don\xe2\x80\x99t let me do an\r\ninjustice--innocently hints on it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHints on what, my dear Madam?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s conduct to me this morning. Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s heartless secrecy.\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s undutiful silence. I repeat the words: Heartless secrecy.\r\nUndutiful silence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me for one moment, Lady Lundie--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow _me,_ Sir Patrick! Heaven knows how unwilling I am to speak of\r\nit. Heaven knows that not a word of reference to it escaped _my_ lips.\r\nBut you leave me no choice now. As mistress of the household, as a\r\nChristian woman, as the widow of your dear brother, as a mother to this\r\nmisguided girl, I must state the facts. I know you mean well; I know you\r\nwish to spare me. Quite useless! I must state the facts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick bowed, and submitted. (If he had only been a bricklayer! and\r\nif Lady Lundie had not been, what her ladyship unquestionably was, the\r\nstrongest person of the two!)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPermit me to draw a veil, for your sake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Lundie, \xe2\x80\x9cover the\r\nhorrors--I can not, with the best wish to spare you, conscientiously\r\ncall them by any other name--the horrors that took place up stairs. The\r\nmoment I heard that Blanche was ill I was at my post. Duty will always\r\nfind me ready, Sir Patrick, to my dying day. Shocking as the whole thing\r\nwas, I presided calmly over the screams and sobs of my step-daughter.\r\nI closed my ears to the profane violence of her language. I set\r\nthe necessary example, as an English gentlewoman at the head of her\r\nhousehold. It was only when I distinctly heard the name of a person,\r\nnever to be mentioned again in my family circle, issue (if I may use\r\nthe expression) from Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s lips that I began to be really alarmed. I\r\nsaid to my maid: \xe2\x80\x98Hopkins, this is not Hysteria. This is a possession of\r\nthe devil. Fetch the chloroform.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChloroform, applied in the capacity of an exorcism, was entirely new to\r\nSir Patrick. He preserved his gravity with considerable difficulty. Lady\r\nLundie went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHopkins is an excellent person--but Hopkins has a tongue. She met our\r\ndistinguished medical guest in the corridor, and told him. He was so\r\ngood as to come to the door. I was shocked to trouble him to act in his\r\nprofessional capacity while he was a visitor, an honored visitor, in my\r\nhouse. Besides, I considered it more a case for a clergyman than for a\r\nmedical man. However, there was no help for it after Hopkins\xe2\x80\x99s tongue.\r\nI requested our eminent friend to favor us with--I think the exact\r\nscientific term is--a Prognosis. He took the purely material view\r\nwhich was only to be expected from a person in his profession. He\r\nprognosed--_am_ I right? Did he prognose? or did he diagnose? A habit of\r\nspeaking correctly is _so_ important, Sir Patrick! and I should be _so_\r\ngrieved to mislead you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, Lady Lundie! I have heard the medical report. Don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble\r\nyourself to repeat it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t trouble myself to repeat it?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Lady Lundie--with her\r\ndignity up in arms at the bare prospect of finding her remarks abridged.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, Sir Patrick! that little constitutional impatience of yours!--Oh,\r\ndear me! how often you must have given way to it, and how often you must\r\nhave regretted it, in your time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear lady! if you wish to repeat the report, why not say so, in\r\nplain words? Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me hurry you. Let us have the prognosis, by all\r\nmeans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie shook her head compassionately, and smiled with angelic\r\nsadness. \xe2\x80\x9cOur little besetting sins!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat slaves we are to\r\nour little besetting sins! Take a turn in the room--do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAny ordinary man would have lost his temper. But the law (as Sir Patrick\r\nhad told his niece) has a special temper of its own. Without\r\nexhibiting the smallest irritation, Sir Patrick dextrously applied his\r\nsister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s blister to his sister-in-law herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an eye you have!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was impatient. I _am_ impatient. I\r\nam dying to know what Blanche said to you when she got better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe British Matron froze up into a matron of stone on the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing!\xe2\x80\x9d answered her ladyship, with a vicious snap of her teeth, as\r\nif she had tried to bite the word before it escaped her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Lady Lundie, with her most formidable emphasis of\r\nlook and tone. \xe2\x80\x9cI applied all the remedies with my own hands; I cut her\r\nlaces with my own scissors, I completely wetted her head through with\r\ncold water; I remained with her until she was quite exhausted--I took\r\nher in my arms, and folded her to my bosom; I sent every body out of the\r\nroom; I said, \xe2\x80\x98Dear child, confide in me.\xe2\x80\x99 And how were my advances--my\r\nmotherly advances--met? I have already told you. By heartless secrecy.\r\nBy undutiful silence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick pressed the blister a little closer to the skin. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was\r\nprobably afraid to speak,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid? Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lady Lundie, distrusting the evidence of her own\r\nsenses. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t have said that? I have evidently misapprehended you.\r\nYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t really say, afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said she was probably afraid--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop! I can\xe2\x80\x99t be told to my face that I have failed to do my duty by\r\nBlanche. No, Sir Patrick! I can bear a great deal; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear\r\nthat. After having been more than a mother to your dear brother\xe2\x80\x99s child;\r\nafter having been an elder sister to Blanche; after having toiled--I say\r\n_toiled,_ Sir Patrick!--to cultivate her intelligence (with the sweet\r\nlines of the poet ever present to my memory: \xe2\x80\x98Delightful task to rear\r\nthe tender mind, and teach the young idea how to shoot!\xe2\x80\x99); after having\r\ndone all I have done--a place in the carriage only yesterday, and a\r\nvisit to the most interesting relic of feudal times in Perthshire--after\r\nhaving sacrificed all I have sacrificed, to be told that I have behaved\r\nin such a manner to Blanche as to frighten her when I ask her to confide\r\nin me, is a little too cruel. I have a sensitive--an unduly sensitive\r\nnature, dear Sir Patrick. Forgive me for wincing when I am wounded.\r\nForgive me for feeling it when the wound is dealt me by a person whom I\r\nrevere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer ladyship put her handkerchief to her eyes. Any other man would have\r\ntaken off the blister. Sir Patrick pressed it harder than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou quite mistake me,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI meant that Blanche was afraid to\r\ntell you the true cause of her illness. The true cause is anxiety about\r\nMiss Silvester.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie emitted another scream--a loud scream this time--and closed\r\nher eyes in horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can run out of the house,\xe2\x80\x9d cried her ladyship, wildly. \xe2\x80\x9cI can fly to\r\nthe uttermost corners of the earth; but I can _not_ hear that person\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname mentioned! No, Sir Patrick! not in my presence! not in my room!\r\nnot while I am mistress at Windygates House!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to say any thing that is disagreeable to you, Lady Lundie.\r\nBut the nature of my errand here obliges me to touch--as lightly as\r\npossible--on something which has happened in your house without your\r\nknowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie suddenly opened her eyes, and became the picture of\r\nattention. A casual observer might have supposed her ladyship to be not\r\nwholly inaccessible to the vulgar emotion of curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA visitor came to Windygates yesterday, while we were all at lunch,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n proceeded Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cShe--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie seized the scarlet memorandum-book, and stopped her\r\nbrother-in-law, before he could get any further. Her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s next\r\nwords escaped her lips spasmodically, like words let at intervals out of\r\na trap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI undertake--as a woman accustomed to self-restraint, Sir Patrick--I\r\nundertake to control myself, on one condition. I won\xe2\x80\x99t have the name\r\nmentioned. I won\xe2\x80\x99t have the sex mentioned. Say, \xe2\x80\x98The Person,\xe2\x80\x99 if\r\nyou please. \xe2\x80\x98The Person,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d continued Lady Lundie, opening her\r\nmemorandum-book and taking up her pen, \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted an audacious invasion\r\nof my premises yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick bowed. Her ladyship made a note--a fiercely-penned note\r\nthat scratched the paper viciously--and then proceeded to examine her\r\nbrother-in-law, in the capacity of witness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat part of my house did \xe2\x80\x98The Person\xe2\x80\x99 invade? Be very careful, Sir\r\nPatrick! I propose to place myself under the protection of a justice of\r\nthe peace; and this is a memorandum of my statement. The library--did I\r\nunderstand you to say? Just so--the library.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdd,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick, with another pressure on the blister, \xe2\x80\x9cthat The\r\nPerson had an interview with Blanche in the library.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s pen suddenly stuck in the paper, and scattered a little\r\nshower of ink-drops all round it. \xe2\x80\x9cThe library,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated her ladyship,\r\nin a voice suggestive of approaching suffocation. \xe2\x80\x9cI undertake to\r\ncontrol myself, Sir Patrick! Any thing missing from the library?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing missing, Lady Lundie, but The Person herself. She--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir Patrick! I won\xe2\x80\x99t have it! In the name of my own sex, I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray pardon me--I forgot that \xe2\x80\x98she\xe2\x80\x99 was a prohibited pronoun on the\r\npresent occasion. The Person has written a farewell letter to Blanche,\r\nand has gone nobody knows where. The distress produced by these events\r\nis alone answerable for what has happened to Blanche this morning. If\r\nyou bear that in mind--and if you remember what your own opinion is of\r\nMiss Silvester--you will understand why Blanche hesitated to admit you\r\ninto her confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere he waited for a reply. Lady Lundie was too deeply absorbed in\r\ncompleting her memorandum to be conscious of his presence in the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Carriage to be at the door at two-thirty,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Lundie,\r\nrepeating the final words of the memorandum while she wrote them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Inquire for the nearest justice of the peace, and place the privacy\r\nof Windygates under the protection of the law.\xe2\x80\x99--I beg your pardon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n exclaimed her ladyship, becoming conscious again of Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I missed any thing particularly painful? Pray mention it\r\nif I have!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have missed nothing of the slightest importance,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sir\r\nPatrick. \xe2\x80\x9cI have placed you in possession of facts which you had a right\r\nto know; and we have now only to return to our medical friend\xe2\x80\x99s report\r\non Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s health. You were about to favor me, I think, with the\r\nPrognosis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiagnosis!\xe2\x80\x9d said her ladyship, spitefully. \xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten at the\r\ntime--I remember now. Prognosis is entirely wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sit corrected, Lady Lundie. Diagnosis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have informed me, Sir Patrick, that you were already acquainted\r\nwith the Diagnosis. It is quite needless for me to repeat it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was anxious to correct my own impression, my dear lady, by comparing\r\nit with yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very good. You are a learned man. I am only a poor ignorant\r\nwoman. Your impression can not possibly require correcting by mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy impression, Lady Lundie, was that our so friend recommended moral,\r\nrather than medical, treatment for Blanche. If we can turn her thoughts\r\nfrom the painful subject on which they are now dwelling, we shall do all\r\nthat is needful. Those were his own words, as I remember them. Do you\r\nconfirm me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan _I_ presume to dispute with you, Sir Patrick? You are a master of\r\nrefined irony, I know. I am afraid it\xe2\x80\x99s all thrown away on poor me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(The law kept its wonderful temper! The law met the most exasperating of\r\nliving women with a counter-power of defensive aggravation all its own!)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take that as confirming me, Lady Lundie. Thank you. Now, as to the\r\nmethod of carrying out our friend\xe2\x80\x99s advice. The method seems plain. All\r\nwe can do to divert Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s mind is to turn Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s attention to\r\nsome other subject of reflection less painful than the subject which\r\noccupies her now. Do you agree, so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy place the whole responsibility on my shoulders?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Lady\r\nLundie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of profound deference for your opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sir Patrick.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrictly speaking, no doubt, any serious responsibility rests with me.\r\nI am Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s guardian--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lady Lundie, with a perfect explosion of pious\r\nfervor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear an outburst of devout thankfulness,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cAm\r\nI to take it as expressing--let me say--some little doubt, on your\r\npart, as to the prospect of managing Blanche successfully, under present\r\ncircumstances?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s temper began to give way again--exactly as her\r\nbrother-in-law had anticipated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are to take it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cas expressing my conviction that I\r\nsaddled myself with the charge of an incorrigibly heartless, obstinate\r\nand perverse girl, when I undertook the care of Blanche.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you say \xe2\x80\x98incorrigibly?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said \xe2\x80\x98incorrigibly.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the case is as hopeless as that, my dear Madam--as Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nguardian, I ought to find means to relieve you of the charge of\r\nBlanche.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody shall relieve _me_ of a duty that I have once undertaken!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n retorted Lady Lundie. \xe2\x80\x9cNot if I die at my post!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose it was consistent with your duty,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nbe relieved at your post? Suppose it was in harmony with that\r\n\xe2\x80\x98self-sacrifice\xe2\x80\x99 which is \xe2\x80\x98the motto of women?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you, Sir Patrick. Be so good as to explain\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick assumed a new character--the character of a hesitating man.\r\nHe cast a look of respectful inquiry at his sister-in-law, sighed, and\r\nshook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be asking too much. Even with your high\r\nstandard of duty, it would be asking too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing which you can ask me in the name of duty is too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! no! Let me remind you. Human nature has its limits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Christian gentlewoman\xe2\x80\x99s sense of duty knows no limits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, surely yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick! after what I have just said your perseverance in doubting\r\nme amounts to something like an insult!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that! Let me put a case. Let\xe2\x80\x99s suppose the future interests\r\nof another person depend on your saying, Yes--when all your own most\r\ncherished ideas and opinions urge you to say, No. Do you really mean to\r\ntell me that you could trample your own convictions under foot, if\r\nit could be shown that the purely abstract consideration of duty was\r\ninvolved in the sacrifice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lady Lundie, mounting the pedestal of her virtue on the\r\nspot. \xe2\x80\x9cYes--without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sit corrected, Lady Lundie. You embolden me to proceed. Allow me to\r\nask (after what I just heard)--whether it is not your duty to act\r\non advice given for Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s benefit, by one the highest medical\r\nauthorities in England?\xe2\x80\x9d Her ladyship admitted that it was her\r\nduty; pending a more favorable opportunity for contradicting her\r\nbrother-in-law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cAssuming that Blanche is like most\r\nother human beings, and has some prospect of happiness to contemplate,\r\nif she could only be made to see it--are we not bound to make her see\r\nit, by our moral obligation to act on the medical advice?\xe2\x80\x9d He cast a\r\ncourteously-persuasive look at her ladyship, and paused in the most\r\ninnocent manner for a reply.\r\n\r\nIf Lady Lundie had not been bent--thanks to the irritation fomented by\r\nher brother-in-law--on disputing the ground with him, inch by inch, she\r\nmust have seen signs, by this time, of the snare that was being set\r\nfor her. As it was, she saw nothing but the opportunity of disparaging\r\nBlanche and contradicting Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf my step-daughter had any such prospect as you describe,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI should of course say, Yes. But Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s is an\r\nill-regulated mind. An ill-regulated mind has no prospect of happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cBlanche _has_ a prospect of happiness.\r\nIn other words, Blanche has a prospect of being married. And what is\r\nmore, Arnold Brinkworth is ready to marry her as soon as the settlements\r\ncan be prepared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie started in her chair--turned crimson with rage--and opened\r\nher lips to speak. Sir Patrick rose to his feet, and went on before she\r\ncould utter a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg to relieve you, Lady Lundie--by means which you have just\r\nacknowledged it to be your duty to accept--of all further charge of an\r\nincorrigible girl. As Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s guardian, I have the honor of proposing\r\nthat her marriage be advanced to a day to be hereafter named in the\r\nfirst fortnight of the ensuing month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn those words he closed the trap which he had set for his\r\nsister-in-law, and waited to see what came of it.\r\n\r\nA thoroughly spiteful woman, thoroughly roused, is capable of\r\nsubordinating every other consideration to the one imperative necessity\r\nof gratifying her spite. There was but one way now of turning the tables\r\non Sir Patrick--and Lady Lundie took it. She hated him, at that moment,\r\nso intensely, that not even the assertion of her own obstinate will\r\npromised her more than a tame satisfaction, by comparison with the\r\npriceless enjoyment of beating her brother-in-law with his own weapons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Sir Patrick!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a little silvery laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have\r\nwasted much precious time and many eloquent words in trying to entrap\r\nme into giving my consent, when you might have had it for the asking.\r\nI think the idea of hastening Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s marriage an excellent one. I am\r\ncharmed to transfer the charge of such a person as my step-daughter to\r\nthe unfortunate young man who is willing to take her off my hands. The\r\nless he sees of Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s character the more satisfied I shall feel of\r\nhis performing his engagement to marry her. Pray hurry the lawyers, Sir\r\nPatrick, and let it be a week sooner rather than a week later, if you\r\nwish to please Me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer ladyship rose in her grandest proportions, and made a courtesy\r\nwhich was nothing less than a triumph of polite satire in dumb show. Sir\r\nPatrick answered by a profound bow and a smile which said, eloquently,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe every word of that charming answer. Admirable woman--adieu!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the one person in the family circle, whose opposition might have\r\nforced Sir Patrick to submit to a timely delay, was silenced by adroit\r\nmanagement of the vices of her own character. So, in despite of herself,\r\nLady Lundie was won over to the project for hurrying the marriage of\r\nArnold and Blanche.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE TWENTY-EIGHTH.\r\n\r\nSTIFLED.\r\n\r\nIT is the nature of Truth to struggle to the light. In more than one\r\ndirection, the truth strove to pierce the overlying darkness, and to\r\nreveal itself to view, during the interval between the date of Sir\r\nPatrick\xe2\x80\x99s victory and the date of the wedding-day.\r\n\r\nSigns of perturbation under the surface, suggestive of some hidden\r\ninfluence at work, were not wanting, as the time passed on. The one\r\nthing missing was the prophetic faculty that could read those signs\r\naright at Windygates House.\r\n\r\nOn the very day when Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s dextrous treatment of his\r\nsister-in-law had smoothed the way to the hastening of the marriage,\r\nan obstacle was raised to the new arrangement by no less a person than\r\nBlanche herself. She had sufficiently recovered, toward noon, to be able\r\nto receive Arnold in her own little sitting-room. It proved to be a very\r\nbrief interview. A quarter of an hour later, Arnold appeared before Sir\r\nPatrick--while the old gentleman was sunning himself in the garden--with\r\na face of blank despair. Blanche had indignantly declined even to think\r\nof such a thing as her marriage, at a time when she was heart-broken by\r\nthe discovery that Anne had left her forever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou gave me leave to mention it, Sir Patrick--didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick shifted round a little, so as to get the sun on his back,\r\nand admitted that he had given leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had only known, I would rather have cut my tongue out than have\r\nsaid a word about it. What do you think she did? She burst out crying,\r\nand ordered me to leave the room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely morning--a cool breeze tempered the heat of the sun; the\r\nbirds were singing; the garden wore its brightest look. Sir Patrick was\r\nsupremely comfortable. The little wearisome vexations of this mortal\r\nlife had retired to a respectful distance from him. He positively\r\ndeclined to invite them to come any nearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is a world,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, getting the sun a little more\r\nbroadly on his back, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich a merciful Creator has filled with lovely\r\nsights, harmonious sounds, delicious scents; and here are creatures\r\nwith faculties expressly made for enjoyment of those sights, sounds, and\r\nscents--to say nothing of Love, Dinner, and Sleep, all thrown into the\r\nbargain. And these same creatures hate, starve, toss sleepless on their\r\npillows, see nothing pleasant, hear nothing pleasant, smell nothing\r\npleasant--cry bitter tears, say hard words, contract painful illnesses;\r\nwither, sink, age, die! What does it mean, Arnold? And how much longer\r\nis it all to go on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fine connecting link between the blindness of Blanche to the\r\nadvantage of being married, and the blindness of humanity to the\r\nadvantage of being in existence, though sufficiently perceptible no\r\ndoubt to venerable Philosophy ripening in the sun, was absolutely\r\ninvisible to Arnold. He deliberately dropped the vast question opened by\r\nSir Patrick; and, reverting to Blanche, asked what was to be done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you do with a fire, when you can\xe2\x80\x99t extinguish it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir\r\nPatrick. \xe2\x80\x9cYou let it blaze till it goes out. What do you do with a woman\r\nwhen you can\xe2\x80\x99t pacify her? Let _her_ blaze till she goes out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold failed to see the wisdom embodied in that excellent advice. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought you would have helped me to put things right with Blanche,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _am_ helping you. Let Blanche alone. Don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of the marriage\r\nagain, the next time you see her. If she mentions it, beg her pardon,\r\nand tell her you won\xe2\x80\x99t press the question any more. I shall see her in\r\nan hour or two, and I shall take exactly the same tone myself. You have\r\nput the idea into her mind--leave it there to ripen. Give her distress\r\nabout Miss Silvester nothing to feed on. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stimulate it by\r\ncontradiction; don\xe2\x80\x99t rouse it to defend itself by disparagement of her\r\nlost friend. Leave Time to edge her gently nearer and nearer to the\r\nhusband who is waiting for her--and take my word for it, Time will have\r\nher ready when the settlements are ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nToward the luncheon hour Sir Patrick saw Blanche, and put in practice\r\nthe principle which he had laid down. She was perfectly tranquil before\r\nher uncle left her. A little later, Arnold was forgiven. A little later\r\nstill, the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s sharp observation noted that his niece was\r\nunusually thoughtful, and that she looked at Arnold, from time to time,\r\nwith an interest of a new kind--an interest which shyly hid itself\r\nfrom Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s view. Sir Patrick went up to dress for dinner, with a\r\ncomfortable inner conviction that the difficulties which had beset him\r\nwere settled at last. Sir Patrick had never been more mistaken in his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe business of the toilet was far advanced. Duncan had just placed the\r\nglass in a good light; and Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s master was at that turning point in\r\nhis daily life which consisted in attaining, or not attaining, absolute\r\nperfection in the tying of his white cravat--when some outer barbarian,\r\nignorant of the first principles of dressing a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s throat,\r\npresumed to knock at the bedroom door. Neither master nor servant moved\r\nor breathed until the integrity of the cravat was placed beyond the\r\nreach of accident. Then Sir Patrick cast the look of final criticism in\r\nthe glass, and breathed again when he saw that it was done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little labored in style, Duncan. But not bad, considering the\r\ninterruption?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means, Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee who it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan went to the door; and returned, to his master, with an excuse for\r\nthe interruption, in the shape of a telegram!\r\n\r\nSir Patrick started at the sight of that unwelcome message. \xe2\x80\x9cSign the\r\nreceipt, Duncan,\xe2\x80\x9d he said--and opened the envelope. Yes! Exactly as he\r\nhad anticipated! News of Miss Silvester, on the very day when he had\r\ndecided to abandon all further attempt at discovering her. The telegram\r\nran thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMessage received from Falkirk this morning. Lady, as described, left\r\nthe train at Falkirk last night. Went on, by the first train this\r\nmorning, to Glasgow. Wait further instructions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the messenger to take any thing back, Sir Patrick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I must consider what I am to do. If I find it necessary I will send\r\nto the station. Here is news of Miss Silvester, Duncan,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Sir\r\nPatrick, when the messenger had gone. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has been traced to Glasgow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlasgow is a large place, Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Even if they have telegraphed on and had her watched (which\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear), she may escape us again at Glasgow. I am the last man\r\nin the world, I hope, to shrink from accepting my fair share of any\r\nresponsibility. But I own I would have given something to have kept this\r\ntelegram out of the house. It raises the most awkward question I have\r\nhad to decide on for many a long day past. Help me on with my coat. I\r\nmust think of it! I must think of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick went down to dinner in no agreeable frame of mind. The\r\nunexpected recovery of the lost trace of Miss Silvester--there is no\r\ndisguising it--seriously annoyed him.\r\n\r\nThe dinner-party that day, assembling punctually at the stroke of the\r\nbell, had to wait a quarter of an hour before the hostess came down\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s apology, when she entered the library, informed her\r\nguests that she had been detained by some neighbors who had called at\r\nan unusually late hour. Mr. and Mrs. Julius Delamayn, finding themselves\r\nnear Windygates, had favored her with a visit, on their way home, and\r\nhad left cards of invitation for a garden-party at their house.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie was charmed with her new acquaintances. They had included\r\nevery body who was staying at Windygates in their invitation. They had\r\nbeen as pleasant and easy as old friends. Mrs. Delamayn had brought the\r\nkindest message from one of her guests--Mrs. Glenarm--to say that she\r\nremembered meeting Lady Lundie in London, in the time of the late Sir\r\nThomas, and was anxious to improve the acquaintance. Mr. Julius Delamayn\r\nhad given a most amusing account of his brother. Geoffrey had sent to\r\nLondon for a trainer; and the whole household was on the tip-toe of\r\nexpectation to witness the magnificent spectacle of an athlete preparing\r\nhimself for a foot-race. The ladies, with Mrs. Glenarm at their head,\r\nwere hard at work, studying the profound and complicated question of\r\nhuman running--the muscles employed in it, the preparation required for\r\nit, the heroes eminent in it. The men had been all occupied that morning\r\nin assisting Geoffrey to measure a mile, for his exercising-ground, in a\r\nremote part of the park--where there was an empty cottage, which was\r\nto be fitted with all the necessary appliances for the reception of\r\nGeoffrey and his trainer. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will see the last of my brother,\xe2\x80\x9d Julius\r\nhad said, \xe2\x80\x9cat the garden-party. After that he retires into athletic\r\nprivacy, and has but one interest in life--the interest of watching the\r\ndisappearance of his own superfluous flesh.\xe2\x80\x9d Throughout the dinner Lady\r\nLundie was in oppressively good spirits, singing the praises of her new\r\nfriends. Sir Patrick, on the other hand, had never been so silent within\r\nthe memory of mortal man. He talked with an effort; and he listened with\r\na greater effort still. To answer or not to answer the telegram in his\r\npocket? To persist or not to persist in his resolution to leave Miss\r\nSilvester to go her own way? Those were the questions which insisted on\r\ncoming round to him as regularly as the dishes themselves came round in\r\nthe orderly progression of the dinner.\r\n\r\nBlanche---who had not felt equal to taking her place at the\r\ntable--appeared in the drawing-room afterward.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick came in to tea, with the gentlemen, still uncertain as to\r\nthe right course to take in the matter of the telegram. One look at\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s sad face and Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s altered manner decided him. What would\r\nbe the result if he roused new hopes by resuming the effort to trace\r\nMiss Silvester, and if he lost the trace a second time? He had only to\r\nlook at his niece and to see. Could any consideration justify him in\r\nturning her mind back on the memory of the friend who had left her at\r\nthe moment when it was just beginning to look forward for relief to the\r\nprospect of her marriage? Nothing could justify him; and nothing should\r\ninduce him to do it.\r\n\r\nReasoning--soundly enough, from his own point of view--on that basis,\r\nSir Patrick determined on sending no further instructions to his friend\r\nat Edinburgh. That night he warned Duncan to preserve the strictest\r\nsilence as to the arrival of the telegram. He burned it, in case of\r\naccidents, with his own hand, in his own room.\r\n\r\nRising the next day and looking out of his window, Sir Patrick saw\r\nthe two young people taking their morning walk at a moment when\r\nthey happened to cross the open grassy space which separated the two\r\nshrubberies at Windygates. Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s arm was round Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s waist, and\r\nthey were talking confidentially with their heads close together.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is coming round already!\xe2\x80\x9d thought the old gentleman, as the two\r\ndisappeared again in the second shrubbery from view. \xe2\x80\x9cThank Heaven!\r\nthings are running smoothly at last!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAmong the ornaments of Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s bed room there was a view (taken\r\nfrom above) of one of the Highland waterfalls. If he had looked at the\r\npicture when he turned away from his window, he might have remarked that\r\na river which is running with its utmost smoothness at one moment may be\r\na river which plunges into its most violent agitation at another; and he\r\nmight have remembered, with certain misgivings, that the progress of a\r\nstream of water has been long since likened, with the universal consent\r\nof humanity, to the progress of the stream of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH SCENE.--GLASGOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE TWENTY-NINTH.\r\n\r\nANNE AMONG THE LAWYERS.\r\n\r\nON the day when Sir Patrick received the second of the two telegrams\r\nsent to him from Edinburgh, four respectable inhabitants of the City of\r\nGlasgow were startled by the appearance of an object of interest on the\r\nmonotonous horizon of their daily lives.\r\n\r\nThe persons receiving this wholesome shock were--Mr. and Mrs. Karnegie\r\nof the Sheep\xe2\x80\x99s Head Hotel--and Mr. Camp, and Mr. Crum, attached as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWriters\xe2\x80\x9d to the honorable profession of the Law.\r\n\r\nIt was still early in the day when a lady arrived, in a cab from the\r\nrailway, at the Sheep\xe2\x80\x99s Head Hotel. Her luggage consisted of a black\r\nbox, and of a well-worn leather bag which she carried in her hand. The\r\nname on the box (recently written on a new luggage label, as the color\r\nof the ink and paper showed) was a very good name in its way, common\r\nto a very great number of ladies, both in Scotland and England. It was\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Graham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEncountering the landlord at the entrance to the hotel, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n asked to be accommodated with a bedroom, and was transferred in due\r\ncourse to the chamber-maid on duty at the time. Returning to the little\r\nroom behind the bar, in which the accounts were kept, Mr. Karnegie\r\nsurprised his wife by moving more briskly, and looking much brighter\r\nthan usual. Being questioned, Mr. Karnegie (who had cast the eye of\r\na landlord on the black box in the passage) announced that one \xe2\x80\x9cMrs.\r\nGraham\xe2\x80\x9d had just arrived, and was then and there to be booked as\r\ninhabiting Room Number Seventeen. Being informed (with considerable\r\nasperity of tone and manner) that this answer failed to account for\r\nthe interest which appeared to have been inspired in him by a total\r\nstranger, Mr. Karnegie came to the point, and confessed that \xe2\x80\x9cMrs.\r\nGraham\xe2\x80\x9d was one of the sweetest-looking women he had seen for many a\r\nlong day, and that he feared she was very seriously out of health.\r\n\r\nUpon that reply the eyes of Mrs. Karnegie developed in size, and the\r\ncolor of Mrs. Karnegie deepened in tint. She got up from her chair and\r\nsaid that it might be just as well if she personally superintended the\r\ninstallation of \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x9d in her room, and personally satisfied\r\nherself that \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x9d was a fit inmate to be received at the\r\nSheep\xe2\x80\x99s Head Hotel. Mr. Karnegie thereupon did what he always did--he\r\nagreed with his wife.\r\n\r\nMrs. Karnegie was absent for some little time. On her return her eyes\r\nhad a certain tigerish cast in them when they rested on Mr. Karnegie.\r\nShe ordered tea and some light refreshment to be taken to Number\r\nSeventeen. This done--without any visible provocation to account for the\r\nremark--she turned upon her husband, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Karnegie you are\r\na fool.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Karnegie asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Karnegie snapped\r\nher fingers, and said, \xe2\x80\x9c_That_ for her good looks! You don\xe2\x80\x99t know a\r\ngood-looking woman when you see her.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Karnegie agreed with his wife.\r\n\r\nNothing more was said until the waiter appeared at the bar with\r\nhis tray. Mrs. Karnegie, having first waived the tray off, without\r\ninstituting her customary investigation, sat down suddenly with a thump,\r\nand said to her husband (who had not uttered a word in the interval),\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk to Me about her being out of health! _That_ for her health!\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s trouble on her mind.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Karnegie said, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it now?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Karnegie\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I have said, It is, I consider myself insulted if another\r\nperson says, Is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Karnegie agreed with his wife.\r\n\r\nThere was another interval. Mrs. Karnegie added up a bill, with a\r\nface of disgust. Mr. Karnegie looked at her with a face of wonder. Mrs.\r\nKarnegie suddenly asked him why he wasted his looks on _her_,  when he\r\nwould have \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x9d to look at before long. Mr. Karnegie, upon\r\nthat, attempted to compromise the matter by looking, in the interim, at\r\nhis own boots. Mrs. Karnegie wished to know whether after twenty years\r\nof married life, she was considered to be not worth answering by her own\r\nhusband. Treated with bare civility (she expected no more), she might\r\nhave gone on to explain that \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x9d was going out. She might also\r\nhave been prevailed on to mention that \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x9d had asked her a\r\nvery remarkable question of a business nature, at the interview between\r\nthem up stairs. As it was, Mrs. Karnegie\xe2\x80\x99s lips were sealed, and let\r\nMr. Karnegie deny if he dared, that he richly deserved it. Mr. Karnegie\r\nagreed with his wife.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour more, \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x9d came down stairs; and a cab was sent\r\nfor. Mr. Karnegie, in fear of the consequences if he did otherwise, kept\r\nin a corner. Mrs. Karnegie followed him into the corner, and asked him\r\nhow he dared act in that way? Did he presume to think, after twenty\r\nyears of married life, that his wife was jealous? \xe2\x80\x9cGo, you brute, and\r\nhand Mrs. Graham into the cab!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Karnegie obeyed. He asked, at the cab window, to what part of\r\nGlasgow he should tell the driver to go. The reply informed him that the\r\ndriver was to take \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x9d to the office of Mr. Camp, the lawyer.\r\nAssuming \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x9d to be a stranger in Glasgow, and remembering that\r\nMr. Camp was Mr. Karnegie\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, the inference appeared to be, that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d remarkable question, addressed to the landlady, had\r\nrelated to legal business, and to the discovery of a trust-worthy person\r\ncapable of transacting it for her.\r\n\r\nReturning to the bar, Mr. Karnegie found his eldest daughter in charge\r\nof the books, the bills, and the waiters. Mrs. Karnegie had retired to\r\nher own room, justly indignant with her husband for his infamous conduct\r\nin handing \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x9d into the cab before her own eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the old\r\nstory, Pa,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Miss Karnegie, with the most perfect composure.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMa told you to do it, of course; and then Ma says you\xe2\x80\x99ve insulted her\r\nbefore all the servants. I wonder how you bear it?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Karnegie looked\r\nat his boots, and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder, too, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Karnegie\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not going to Ma, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Karnegie looked up from his\r\nboots, and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI must, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Camp sat in his private room, absorbed over his papers.\r\nMultitudinous as those documents were, they appeared to be not\r\nsufficiently numerous to satisfy Mr. Camp. He rang his bell, and ordered\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe clerk appearing with a new pile of papers, appeared also with a\r\nmessage. A lady, recommended by Mrs. Karnegie, of the Sheep\xe2\x80\x99s Head,\r\nwished to consult Mr. Camp professionally. Mr. Camp looked at his watch,\r\ncounting out precious time before him, in a little stand on the table,\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cShow the lady in, in ten minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes the lady appeared. She took the client\xe2\x80\x99s chair and lifted\r\nher veil. The same effect which had been produced on Mr. Karnegie was\r\nonce more produced on Mr. Camp. For the first time, for many a long year\r\npast, he felt personally interested in a total stranger. It might have\r\nbeen something in her eyes, or it might have been something in her\r\nmanner. Whatever it was, it took softly hold of him, and made him, to\r\nhis own exceeding surprise, unmistakably anxious to hear what she had to\r\nsay!\r\n\r\nThe lady announced--in a low sweet voice touched with a quiet\r\nsadness--that her business related to a question of marriage (as\r\nmarriage is understood by Scottish law), and that her own peace of mind,\r\nand the happiness of a person very dear to her, were concerned alike\r\nin the opinion which Mr. Camp might give when he had been placed in\r\npossession of the facts.\r\n\r\nShe then proceeded to state the facts, without mentioning names:\r\nrelating in every particular precisely the same succession of events\r\nwhich Geoffrey Delamayn had already related to Sir Patrick Lundie--with\r\nthis one difference, that she acknowledged herself to be the woman who\r\nwas personally concerned in knowing whether, by Scottish law, she was\r\nnow held to be a married woman or not.\r\n\r\nMr. Camp\xe2\x80\x99s opinion given upon this, after certain questions had been\r\nasked and answered, differed from Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, as given at\r\nWindygates. He too quoted the language used by the eminent judge--Lord\r\nDeas--but he drew an inference of his own from it. \xe2\x80\x9cIn Scotland, consent\r\nmakes marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand consent may be proved by inference. I see\r\na plain inference of matrimonial consent in the circumstances which you\r\nhave related to me and I say you are a married woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe effect produced on the lady, when sentence was pronounced on her in\r\nthose terms, was so distressing that Mr. Camp sent a message up stairs\r\nto his wife; and Mrs. Camp appeared in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s private room,\r\nin business hours, for the first time in her life. When Mrs. Camp\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservices had in some degree restored the lady to herself, Mr. Camp\r\nfollowed with a word of professional comfort. He, like Sir Patrick,\r\nacknowledged the scandalous divergence of opinions produced by the\r\nconfusion and uncertainty of the marriage-law of Scotland. He, like\r\nSir Patrick, declared it to be quite possible that another lawyer might\r\narrive at another conclusion. \xe2\x80\x9cGo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, giving her his card, with a\r\nline of writing on it, \xe2\x80\x9cto my colleague, Mr. Crum; and say I sent you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady gratefully thanked Mr. Camp and his wife, and went next to the\r\noffice of Mr. Crum.\r\n\r\nMr. Crum was the older lawyer of the two, and the harder lawyer of the\r\ntwo; but he, too, felt the influence which the charm that there was in\r\nthis woman exercised, more or less, over every man who came in contact\r\nwith her. He listened with a patience which was rare with him: he put\r\nhis questions with a gentleness which was rarer still; and when _he_\r\nwas in possession of the circumstances---behold, _his_ opinion flatly\r\ncontradicted the opinion of Mr. Camp!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo marriage, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, positively. \xe2\x80\x9cEvidence in favor of perhaps\r\nestablishing a marriage, if you propose to claim the man. But that, as I\r\nunderstand it, is exactly what you don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe relief to the lady, on hearing this, almost overpowered her. For\r\nsome minutes she was unable to speak. Mr. Crum did, what he had never\r\ndone yet in all his experience as a lawyer. He patted a client on the\r\nshoulder, and, more extraordinary still, he gave a client permission\r\nto waste his time. \xe2\x80\x9cWait, and compose yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nCrum--administering the law of humanity. The lady composed herself. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmust ask you some questions, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Crum--administering the\r\nlaw of the land. The lady bowed, and waited for him to begin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, thus far, that you decline to claim the gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nCram. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know now whether the gentleman is likely to claim\r\n_you._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe answer to this was given in the most positive terms. The gentleman\r\nwas not even aware of the position in which he stood. And, more yet, he\r\nwas engaged to be married to the dearest friend whom the lady had in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nMr. Crum opened his eyes--considered--and put another question as\r\ndelicately as he could. \xe2\x80\x9cWould it be painful to you to tell me how the\r\ngentleman came to occupy the awkward position in which he stands now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady acknowledged that it would be indescribably painful to her to\r\nanswer that question.\r\n\r\nMr. Crum offered a suggestion under the form of an inquiry:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould it be painful to you to reveal the circumstances--in the\r\ninterests of the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s future prospects--to some discreet person\r\n(a legal person would be best) who is not, what I am, a stranger to you\r\nboth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady declared herself willing to make any sacrifice, on those\r\nconditions--no matter how painful it might be--for her friend\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\nMr. Crum considered a little longer, and then delivered his word of\r\nadvice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the present stage of the affair,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI need only tell you\r\nwhat is the first step that you ought to take under the circumstances.\r\nInform the gentleman at once--either by word of mouth or by writing--of\r\nthe position in which he stands: and authorize him to place the case in\r\nthe hands of a person known to you both, who is competent to decide on\r\nwhat you are to do next. Do I understand that you know of such a person\r\nso qualified?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady answered that she knew of such a person.\r\n\r\nMr. Crum asked if a day had been fixed for the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s marriage.\r\n\r\nThe lady answered that she had made this inquiry herself on the last\r\noccasion when she had seen the gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s betrothed wife. The marriage\r\nwas to take place, on a day to be hereafter chosen, at the end of the\r\nautumn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Crum, \xe2\x80\x9cis a fortunate circumstance. You have time\r\nbefore you. Time is, here, of very great importance. Be careful not to\r\nwaste it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady said she would return to her hotel and write by that night\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npost, to warn the gentleman of the position in which he stood, and to\r\nauthorize him to refer the matter to a competent and trust-worthy friend\r\nknown to them both.\r\n\r\nOn rising to leave the room she was seized with giddiness, and with some\r\nsudden pang of pain, which turned her deadly pale and forced her to\r\ndrop back into her chair. Mr. Crum had no wife; but he possessed a\r\nhousekeeper--and he offered to send for her. The lady made a sign in the\r\nnegative. She drank a little water, and conquered the pain. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry\r\nto have alarmed you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nothing--I am better now.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nCrum gave her his arm, and put her into the cab. She looked so pale and\r\nfaint that he proposed sending his housekeeper with her. No: it was only\r\nfive minutes\xe2\x80\x99 drive to the hotel. The lady thanked him--and went her way\r\nback by herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letter!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, when she was alone. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I can only live long\r\nenough to write the letter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRTIETH.\r\n\r\nANNE IN THE NEWSPAPERS.\r\n\r\nMRS. KARNEGIE was a woman of feeble intelligence and violent temper;\r\nprompt to take offense, and not, for the most part, easy to appease. But\r\nMrs. Karnegie being--as we all are in our various degrees--a compound of\r\nmany opposite qualities, possessed a character with more than one side\r\nto it, and had her human merits as well as her human faults. Seeds of\r\nsound good feeling were scattered away in the remoter corners of her\r\nnature, and only waited for the fertilizing occasion that was to help\r\nthem to spring up. The occasion exerted that benign influence when the\r\ncab brought Mr. Crum\xe2\x80\x99s client back to the hotel. The face of the weary,\r\nheart-sick woman, as she slowly crossed the hall, roused all that was\r\nheartiest and best in Mrs. Karnegie\xe2\x80\x99s nature, and said to her, as if in\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cJealous of this broken creature? Oh, wife and mother is there no\r\nappeal to your common womanhood _here?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you have overtired yourself, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Let me send you\r\nsomething up stairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend me pen, ink, and paper,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cI must write a letter. I\r\nmust do it at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was useless to remonstrate with her. She was ready to accept any\r\nthing proposed, provided the writing materials were supplied first. Mrs.\r\nKarnegie sent them up, and then compounded a certain mixture of eggs and\r\nhot wine for which The Sheep\xe2\x80\x99s Head was famous, with her own hands. In\r\nfive minutes or so it was ready--and Miss Karnegie was dispatched by\r\nher mother (who had other business on hand at the time) to take it up\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of a few moments a cry of alarm was heard from the upper\r\nlanding. Mrs. Karnegie recognized her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s voice, and hastened to\r\nthe bedroom floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, mamma! Look at her! look at her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe letter was on the table with the first lines written. The woman was\r\non the sofa with her handkerchief twisted between her set teeth, and her\r\ntortured face terrible to look at. Mrs. Karnegie raised her a little,\r\nexamined her closely--then suddenly changed color, and sent her daughter\r\nout of the room with directions to dispatch a messenger instantly for\r\nmedical help.\r\n\r\nLeft alone with the sufferer, Mrs. Karnegie carried her to her bed. As\r\nshe was laid down her left hand fell helpless over the side of the bed.\r\nMrs. Karnegie suddenly checked the word of sympathy as it rose to her\r\nlips--suddenly lifted the hand, and looked, with a momentary sternness\r\nof scrutiny, at the third finger. There was a ring on it. Mrs.\r\nKarnegie\xe2\x80\x99s face softened on the instant: the word of pity that had been\r\nsuspended the moment before passed her lips freely now. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor soul!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said the respectable landlady, taking appearances for granted. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyour husband, dear? Try and tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor made his appearance, and went up to the patient.\r\n\r\nTime passed, and Mr. Karnegie and his daughter, carrying on the business\r\nof the hotel, received a message from up stairs which was ominous of\r\nsomething out of the common. The message gave the name and address of an\r\nexperienced nurse--with the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s compliments, and would Mr. Karnegie\r\nhave the kindness to send for her immediately.\r\n\r\nThe nurse was found and sent up stairs.\r\n\r\nTime went on, and the business of the hotel went on, and it was getting\r\nto be late in the evening, when Mrs. Karnegie appeared at last in the\r\nparlor behind the bar. The landlady\xe2\x80\x99s face was grave, the landlady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmanner was subdued. \xe2\x80\x9cVery, very ill,\xe2\x80\x9d was the only reply she made to her\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries. When she and her husband were together, a little\r\nlater, she told the news from up stairs in greater detail. \xe2\x80\x9cA child born\r\ndead,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Karnegie, in gentler tones than were customary with\r\nher. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the mother dying, poor thing, so far as _I_ can see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA little later the doctor came down. Dead? No.--Likely to live?\r\nImpossible to say. The doctor returned twice in the course of the night.\r\nBoth times he had but one answer. \xe2\x80\x9cWait till to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next day came. She rallied a little. Toward the afternoon she began\r\nto speak. She expressed no surprise at seeing strangers by her bedside:\r\nher mind wandered. She passed again into insensibility. Then back to\r\ndelirium once more. The doctor said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis may last for weeks. Or it may\r\nend suddenly in death. It\xe2\x80\x99s time you did something toward finding her\r\nfriends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(Her friends! She had left the one friend she had forever!)\r\n\r\nMr. Camp was summoned to give his advice. The first thing he asked for\r\nwas the unfinished letter.\r\n\r\nIt was blotted, it was illegible in more places than one. With pains and\r\ncare they made out the address at the beginning, and here and there some\r\nfragments of the lines that followed. It began: \xe2\x80\x9cDear Mr. Brinkworth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Then the writing got, little by little, worse and worse. To the eyes of\r\nthe strangers who looked at it, it ran thus: \xe2\x80\x9cI should ill requite * *\r\n* Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s interests * * * For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake! * * * don\xe2\x80\x99t think of _me_ *\r\n* *\xe2\x80\x9d There was a little more, but not so much as one word, in those last\r\nlines, was legible.\r\n\r\nThe names mentioned in the letter were reported by the doctor and the\r\nnurse to be also the names on her lips when she spoke in her wanderings.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Brinkworth\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cBlanche\xe2\x80\x9d--her mind ran incessantly on those two\r\npersons. The one intelligible thing that she mentioned in connection\r\nwith them was the letter. She was perpetually trying, trying, trying to\r\ntake that unfinished letter to the post; and she could never get there.\r\nSometimes the post was across the sea. Sometimes it was at the top of an\r\ninaccessible mountain. Sometimes it was built in by prodigious walls all\r\nround it. Sometimes a man stopped her cruelly at the moment when she was\r\nclose at the post, and forced her back thousands of miles away from it.\r\nShe once or twice mentioned this visionary man by his name. They made it\r\nout to be \xe2\x80\x9cGeoffrey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFinding no clew to her identity either in the letter that she had tried\r\nto write or in the wild words that escaped her from time to time, it was\r\ndecided to search her luggage, and to look at the clothes which she had\r\nworn when she arrived at the hotel.\r\n\r\nHer black box sufficiently proclaimed itself as recently purchased. On\r\nopening it the address of a Glasgow trunk-maker was discovered inside.\r\nThe linen was also new, and unmarked. The receipted shop-bill was found\r\nwith it. The tradesmen, sent for in each case and questioned, referred\r\nto their books. It was proved that the box and the linen had both been\r\npurchased on the day when she appeared at the hotel.\r\n\r\nHer black bag was opened next. A sum of between eighty and ninety pounds\r\nin Bank of England notes; a few simple articles belonging to the toilet;\r\nmaterials for needle-work; and a photographic portrait of a young\r\nlady, inscribed, \xe2\x80\x9cTo Anne, from Blanche,\xe2\x80\x9d were found in the bag--but no\r\nletters, and nothing whatever that could afford the slightest clew by\r\nwhich the owner could be traced. The pocket in her dress was searched\r\nnext. It contained a purse, an empty card-case, and a new handkerchief\r\nunmarked.\r\n\r\nMr. Camp shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA woman\xe2\x80\x99s luggage without any letters in it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9csuggests to\r\nmy mind a woman who has a motive of her own for keeping her movements\r\na secret. I suspect she has destroyed her letters, and emptied her\r\ncard-case, with that view.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Karnegie\xe2\x80\x99s report, after examining the\r\nlinen which the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Graham\xe2\x80\x9d had worn when she arrived at\r\nthe inn, proved the soundness of the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s opinion. In every case the\r\nmarks had been cut out. Mrs. Karnegie began to doubt whether the ring\r\nwhich she had seen on the third finger of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s left hand had been\r\nplaced there with the sanction of the law.\r\n\r\nThere was but one chance left of discovering--or rather of attempting to\r\ndiscover--her friends. Mr. Camp drew out an advertisement to be inserted\r\nin the Glasgow newspapers. If those newspapers happened to be seen by\r\nany member of her family, she would, in all probability, be claimed.\r\nIn the contrary event there would be nothing for it but to wait for her\r\nrecovery or her death--with the money belonging to her sealed up, and\r\ndeposited in the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s strongbox.\r\n\r\nThe advertisement appeared. They waited for three days afterward, and\r\nnothing came of it. No change of importance occurred, during the same\r\nperiod, in the condition of the suffering woman. Mr. Camp looked in,\r\ntoward evening, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have done our best. There is no help for\r\nit but to wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFar away in Perthshire that third evening was marked as a joyful\r\noccasion at Windygates House. Blanche had consented at last to listen\r\nto Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s entreaties, and had sanctioned the writing of a letter to\r\nLondon to order her wedding-dress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTH SCENE.--SWANHAVEN LODGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRTY-FIRST\r\n\r\nSEEDS OF THE FUTURE (FIRST SOWING).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNOT SO large as Windygates. But--shall we say snug, Jones?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd comfortable, Smith. I quite agree with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch was the judgment pronounced by the two choral gentlemen on Julius\r\nDelamayn\xe2\x80\x99s house in Scotland. It was, as usual with Smith and Jones, a\r\nsound judgment--as far as it went. Swanhaven Lodge was not half the\r\nsize of Windygates; but it had been inhabited for two centuries when\r\nthe foundations of Windygates were first laid--and it possessed the\r\nadvantages, without inheriting the drawbacks, of its age. There is in an\r\nold house a friendly adaptation to the human character, as there is in\r\nan old hat a friendly adaptation to the human head. The visitor who left\r\nSwanhaven quitted it with something like a sense of leaving home. Among\r\nthe few houses not our own which take a strong hold on our sympathies\r\nthis was one. The ornamental grounds were far inferior in size and\r\nsplendor to the grounds at Windygates. But the park was beautiful--less\r\ncarefully laid out, but also less monotonous than an English park. The\r\nlake on the northern boundary of the estate, famous for its breed of\r\nswans, was one of the curiosities of the neighborhood; and the house had\r\na history, associating it with more than one celebrated Scottish name,\r\nwhich had been written and illustrated by Julius Delamayn. Visitors\r\nto Swanhaven Lodge were invariably presented with a copy of the volume\r\n(privately printed). One in twenty read it. The rest were \xe2\x80\x9ccharmed,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nlooked at the pictures.\r\n\r\nThe day was the last day of August, and the occasion was the\r\ngarden-party given by Mr. and Mrs. Delamayn.\r\n\r\nSmith and Jones--following, with the other guests at Windygates, in Lady\r\nLundie\xe2\x80\x99s train--exchanged their opinions on the merits of the house,\r\nstanding on a terrace at the back, near a flight of steps which led down\r\ninto the garden. They formed the van-guard of the visitors, appearing by\r\ntwos and threes from the reception rooms, and all bent on going to see\r\nthe swans before the amusements of the day began. Julius Delamayn came\r\nout with the first detachment, recruited Smith and Jones, and other\r\nwandering bachelors, by the way, and set forth for the lake. An interval\r\nof a minute or two passed--and the terrace remained empty. Then two\r\nladies--at the head of a second detachment of visitors--appeared under\r\nthe old stone porch which sheltered the entrance on that side of the\r\nhouse. One of the ladies was a modest, pleasant little person, very\r\nsimply dressed. The other was of the tall and formidable type of \xe2\x80\x9cfine\r\nwomen,\xe2\x80\x9d clad in dazzling array. The first was Mrs. Julius Delamayn. The\r\nsecond was Lady Lundie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExquisite!\xe2\x80\x9d cried her ladyship, surveying the old mullioned windows\r\nof the house, with their framing of creepers, and the grand stone\r\nbuttresses projecting at intervals from the wall, each with its bright\r\nlittle circle of flowers blooming round the base. \xe2\x80\x9cI am really grieved\r\nthat Sir Patrick should have missed this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you said, Lady Lundie, that Sir Patrick had been called to\r\nEdinburgh by family business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBusiness, Mrs. Delamayn, which is any thing but agreeable to me, as one\r\nmember of the family. It has altered all my arrangements for the autumn.\r\nMy step-daughter is to be married next week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it so near as that? May I ask who the gentleman is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Arnold Brinkworth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely I have some association with that name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have probably heard of him, Mrs. Delamayn, as the heir to Miss\r\nBrinkworth\xe2\x80\x99s Scotch property?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly! Have you brought Mr. Brinkworth here to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bring his apologies, as well as Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s. They went to Edinburgh\r\ntogether the day before yesterday. The lawyers engage to have the\r\nsettlements ready in three or four days more, if a personal consultation\r\ncan be managed. Some formal question, I believe, connected with\r\ntitle-deeds. Sir Patrick thought the safest way and the speediest\r\nway would be to take Mr. Brinkworth with him to Edinburgh--to get the\r\nbusiness over to-day--and to wait until we join them, on our way south,\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou leave Windygates, in this lovely weather?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost unwillingly! The truth is, Mrs. Delamayn, I am at my\r\nstep-daughter\xe2\x80\x99s mercy. Her uncle has the authority, as her guardian--and\r\nthe use he makes of it is to give her her own way in every thing. It was\r\nonly on Friday last that she consented to let the day be fixed--and even\r\nthen she made it a positive condition that the marriage was not to take\r\nplace in Scotland. Pure willfulness! But what can I do? Sir Patrick\r\nsubmits; and Mr. Brinkworth submits. If I am to be present at\r\nthe marriage I must follow their example. I feel it my duty to be\r\npresent--and, as a matter of course, I sacrifice myself. We start for\r\nLondon to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Miss Lundie to be married in London at this time of year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. We only pass through, on our way to Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s place in\r\nKent--the place that came to him with the title; the place associated\r\nwith the last days of my beloved husband. Another trial for _me!_ The\r\nmarriage is to be solemnized on the scene of my bereavement. My old\r\nwound is to be reopened on Monday next--simply because my step-daughter\r\nhas taken a dislike to Windygates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis day week, then, is the day of the marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. This day week. There have been reasons for hurrying it which\r\nI need not trouble you with. No words can say how I wish it was\r\nover.--But, my dear Mrs. Delamayn, how thoughtless of me to assail\r\n_you_ with my family worries! You are so sympathetic. That is my only\r\nexcuse. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me keep you from your guests. I could linger in this\r\nsweet place forever! Where is Mrs. Glenarm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I missed her when we came out on the terrace. She\r\nwill very likely join us at the lake. Do you care about seeing the lake,\r\nLady Lundie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI adore the beauties of Nature, Mrs. Delamayn--especially lakes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have something to show you besides; we have a breed of swans on the\r\nlake, peculiar to the place. My husband has gone on with some of our\r\nfriends; and I believe we are expected to follow, as soon as the rest of\r\nthe party--in charge of my sister--have seen the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what a house, Mrs. Delamayn! Historical associations in every\r\ncorner of it! It is _such_ a relief to my mind to take refuge in the\r\npast. When I am far away from this sweet place I shall people Swanhaven\r\nwith its departed inmates, and share the joys and sorrows of centuries\r\nsince.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Lady Lundie announced, in these terms, her intention of adding to the\r\npopulation of the past, the last of the guests who had been roaming over\r\nthe old house appeared under the porch. Among the members forming this\r\nfinal addition to the garden-party were Blanche, and a friend of her own\r\nage whom she had met at Swanhaven. The two girls lagged behind the rest,\r\ntalking confidentially, arm in arm--the subject (it is surely needless\r\nto add) being the coming marriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, dearest Blanche, why are you not to be married at Windygates?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI detest Windygates, Janet. I have the most miserable associations with\r\nthe place. Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me what they are! The effort of my life is not to\r\nthink of them now. I long to see the last of Windygates. As for being\r\nmarried there, I have made it a condition that I am not to be married in\r\nScotland at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has poor Scotland done to forfeit your good opinion, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Scotland, Janet, is a place where people don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether they\r\nare married or not. I have heard all about it from my uncle. And I\r\nknow somebody who has been a victim--an innocent victim--to a Scotch\r\nmarriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsurd, Blanche! You are thinking of runaway matches, and making\r\nScotland responsible for the difficulties of people who daren\xe2\x80\x99t own the\r\ntruth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not at all absurd. I am thinking of the dearest friend I have. If\r\nyou only knew--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear! _I_ am Scotch, remember! You can be married just as well--I\r\nreally must insist on that--in Scotland as in England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate Scotland!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlanche!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never was so unhappy in my life as I have been in Scotland. I never\r\nwant to see it again. I am determined to be married in England--from the\r\ndear old house where I used to live when I was a little girl. My uncle\r\nis quite willing. _He_ understands me and feels for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that as much as to say that _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you and feel for\r\nyou? Perhaps I had better relieve you of my company, Blanche?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are going to speak to me in that way, perhaps you had!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to hear my native country run down and not to say a word in\r\ndefense of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you Scotch people make such a fuss about your native country!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_We_ Scotch people! you are of Scotch extraction yourself, and you\r\nought to be ashamed to talk in that way. I wish you good-morning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you a better temper!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA minute since the two young ladies had been like twin roses on one\r\nstalk. Now they parted with red cheeks and hostile sentiments and\r\ncutting words. How ardent is the warmth of youth! how unspeakably\r\ndelicate the fragility of female friendship!\r\n\r\nThe flock of visitors followed Mrs. Delamayn to the shores of the lake.\r\nFor a few minutes after the terrace was left a solitude. Then there\r\nappeared under the porch a single gentleman, lounging out with a flower\r\nin his mouth and his hands in his pockets. This was the strongest man at\r\nSwanhaven--otherwise, Geoffrey Delamayn.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment a lady appeared behind him, walking softly, so as not to\r\nbe heard. She was superbly dressed after the newest and the most\r\ncostly Parisian design. The brooch on her bosom was a single diamond of\r\nresplendent water and great size. The fan in her hand was a master-piece\r\nof the finest Indian workmanship. She looked what she was, a person\r\npossessed of plenty of superfluous money, but not additionally blest\r\nwith plenty of superfluous intelligence to correspond. This was the\r\nchildless young widow of the great ironmaster--otherwise, Mrs. Glenarm.\r\n\r\nThe rich woman tapped the strong man coquettishly on the shoulder with\r\nher fan. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! you bad boy!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a slightly-labored archness\r\nof look and manner. \xe2\x80\x9cHave I found you at last?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey sauntered on to the terrace--keeping the lady behind him with\r\na thoroughly savage superiority to all civilized submission to the\r\nsex--and looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said I\xe2\x80\x99d come here when I\xe2\x80\x99d got half an hour to myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled,\r\nturning the flower carelessly between his teeth. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got half an hour,\r\nand here I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you come for the sake of seeing the visitors, or did you come for\r\nthe sake of seeing Me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey smiled graciously, and gave the flower another turn in his\r\nteeth. \xe2\x80\x9cYou. Of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe iron-master\xe2\x80\x99s widow took his arm, and looked up at him--as only a\r\nyoung woman would have dared to look up--with the searching summer light\r\nstreaming in its full brilliancy on her face.\r\n\r\nReduced to the plain expression of what it is really worth, the average\r\nEnglish idea of beauty in women may be summed up in three words--youth,\r\nhealth, plumpness. The more spiritual charm of intelligence and\r\nvivacity, the subtler attraction of delicacy of line and fitness of\r\ndetail, are little looked for and seldom appreciated by the mass of\r\nmen in this island. It is impossible otherwise to account for the\r\nextraordinary blindness of perception which (to give one instance only)\r\nmakes nine Englishmen out of ten who visit France come back declaring\r\nthat they have not seen a single pretty Frenchwoman, in or out of Paris,\r\nin the whole country. Our popular type of beauty proclaims itself, in\r\nits fullest material development, at every shop in which an illustrated\r\nperiodical is sold. The same fleshy-faced girl, with the same inane\r\nsmile, and with no other expression whatever, appears under every form\r\nof illustration, week after week, and month after month, all the year\r\nround. Those who wish to know what Mrs. Glenarm was like, have only to\r\ngo out and stop at any bookseller\xe2\x80\x99s or news-vendor\xe2\x80\x99s shop, and there\r\nthey will see her in the first illustration, with a young woman in it,\r\nwhich they discover in the window. The one noticeable peculiarity in\r\nMrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s purely commonplace and purely material beauty, which\r\nwould have struck an observant and a cultivated man, was the curious\r\ngirlishness of her look and manner. No stranger speaking to this\r\nwoman--who had been a wife at twenty, and who was now a widow at\r\ntwenty-four--would ever have thought of addressing her otherwise than as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the use you make of a flower when I give it to you?\xe2\x80\x9d she said\r\nto Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cMumbling it in your teeth, you wretch, as if you were a\r\nhorse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you come to that,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Geoffrey, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m more a horse than a man.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going to run in a race, and the public are betting on me. Haw! haw!\r\nFive to four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive to four! I believe he thinks of nothing but betting. You great\r\nheavy creature, I can\xe2\x80\x99t move you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see I want to go like the\r\nrest of them to the lake? No! you\xe2\x80\x99re not to let go of my arm! You\xe2\x80\x99re to\r\ntake me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t do it. Must be back with Perry in half an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(Perry was the trainer from London. He had arrived sooner than he had\r\nbeen expected, and had entered on his functions three days since.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me about Perry! A little vulgar wretch. Put him off. You\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t? Do you mean to say you are such a brute that you would rather be\r\nwith Perry than be with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe betting\xe2\x80\x99s at five to four, my dear. And the race comes off in a\r\nmonth from this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! go away to your beloved Perry! I hate you. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll lose the\r\nrace. Stop in your cottage. Pray don\xe2\x80\x99t come back to the house. And--mind\r\nthis!--don\xe2\x80\x99t presume to say \xe2\x80\x98my dear\xe2\x80\x99 to me again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t presuming half far enough, is it? Wait a bit. Give me till the\r\nrace is run--and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll presume to marry you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou! You will be as old as Methuselah, if you wait till I am your wife.\r\nI dare say Perry has got a sister. Suppose you ask him? She would be\r\njust the right person for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey gave the flower another turn in his teeth, and looked as if he\r\nthought the idea worth considering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAny thing to be agreeable to you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask\r\nPerry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned away, as if he was going to do it at once. Mrs. Glenarm put\r\nout a little hand, ravishingly clothed in a blush-colored glove, and\r\nlaid it on the athlete\xe2\x80\x99s mighty arm. She pinched those iron muscles (the\r\npride and glory of England) gently. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a man you are!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nnever met with any body like you before!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe whole secret of the power that Geoffrey had acquired over her was in\r\nthose words.\r\n\r\nThey had been together at Swanhaven for little more than ten days; and\r\nin that time he had made the conquest of Mrs. Glenarm. On the day\r\nbefore the garden-party--in one of the leisure intervals allowed him by\r\nPerry--he had caught her alone, had taken her by the arm, and had asked\r\nher, in so many words, if she would marry him. Instances on record of\r\nwomen who have been wooed and won in ten days are--to speak it with all\r\npossible respect--not wanting. But an instance of a woman willing to\r\nhave it known still remains to be discovered. The iron-master\xe2\x80\x99s widow\r\nexacted a promise of secrecy before the committed herself When Geoffrey\r\nhad pledged his word to hold his tongue in public until she gave\r\nhim leave to speak, Mrs. Glenarm, without further hesitation, said\r\nYes--having, be it observed, said No, in the course of the last two\r\nyears, to at least half a dozen men who were Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s superiors in\r\nevery conceivable respect, except personal comeliness and personal\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nThere is a reason for every thing; and there was a reason for this.\r\n\r\nHowever persistently the epicene theorists of modern times may deny it,\r\nit is nevertheless a truth plainly visible in the whole past history of\r\nthe sexes that the natural condition of a woman is to find her master in\r\na man. Look in the face of any woman who is in no direct way dependent\r\non a man: and, as certainly as you see the sun in a cloudless sky,\r\nyou see a woman who is not happy. The want of a master is their\r\ngreat unknown want; the possession of a master is--unconsciously to\r\nthemselves--the only possible completion of their lives. In ninety-nine\r\ncases out of a hundred this one primitive instinct is at the bottom of\r\nthe otherwise inexplicable sacrifice, when we see a woman, of her own\r\nfree will, throw herself away on a man who is unworthy of her. This\r\none primitive instinct was at the bottom of the otherwise inexplicable\r\nfacility of self-surrender exhibited by Mrs. Glenarm.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of her meeting with Geoffrey, the young widow had\r\ngathered but one experience in her intercourse with the world--the\r\nexperience of a chartered tyrant. In the brief six months of her married\r\nlife with the man whose grand-daughter she might have been--and ought to\r\nhave been--she had only to lift her finger to be obeyed. The doting old\r\nhusband was the willing slave of the petulant young wife\xe2\x80\x99s slightest\r\ncaprice. At a later period, when society offered its triple welcome to\r\nher birth, her beauty, and her wealth--go where she might, she found\r\nherself the object of the same prostrate admiration among the suitors\r\nwho vied with each other in the rivalry for her hand. For the first time\r\nin her life she encountered a man with a will of his own when she met\r\nGeoffrey Delamayn at Swanhaven Lodge.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s occupation of the moment especially favored the conflict\r\nbetween the woman\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of her influence and the man\xe2\x80\x99s assertion\r\nof his will.\r\n\r\nDuring the days that had intervened between his return to his brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse and the arrival of the trainer, Geoffrey had submitted himself\r\nto all needful preliminaries of the physical discipline which was to\r\nprepare him for the race. He knew, by previous experience, what exercise\r\nhe ought to take, what hours he ought to keep, what temptations at the\r\ntable he was bound to resist. Over and over again Mrs. Glenarm tried to\r\nlure him into committing infractions of his own discipline--and over\r\nand over again the influence with men which had never failed her before\r\nfailed her now. Nothing she could say, nothing she could do, would move\r\n_this_ man. Perry arrived; and Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s defiance of every attempted\r\nexercise of the charming feminine tyranny, to which every one else had\r\nbowed, grew more outrageous and more immovable than ever. Mrs. Glenarm\r\nbecame as jealous of Perry as if Perry had been a woman. She flew\r\ninto passions; she burst into tears; she flirted with other men; she\r\nthreatened to leave the house. All quite useless! Geoffrey never once\r\nmissed an appointment with Perry; never once touched any thing to eat\r\nor drink that she could offer him, if Perry had forbidden it. No other\r\nhuman pursuit is so hostile to the influence of the sex as the pursuit\r\nof athletic sports. No men are so entirely beyond the reach of women as\r\nthe men whose lives are passed in the cultivation of their own physical\r\nstrength. Geoffrey resisted Mrs. Glenarm without the slightest effort.\r\nHe casually extorted her admiration, and undesignedly forced her\r\nrespect. She clung to him, as a hero; she recoiled from him, as a brute;\r\nshe struggled with him, submitted to him, despised him, adored him, in a\r\nbreath. And the clew to it all, confused and contradictory as it seemed,\r\nlay in one simple fact--Mrs. Glenarm had found her master.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake me to the lake, Geoffrey!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with a little pleading\r\npressure of the blush-colored hand.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey looked at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cPerry expects me in twenty minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerry again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenarm raised her fan, in a sudden outburst of fury, and broke it\r\nwith one smart blow on Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, with a stamp of her foot. \xe2\x80\x9cMy poor fan broken! You\r\nmonster, all through you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey coolly took the broken fan and put it in his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwrite to London,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand get you another. Come along! Kiss, and\r\nmake it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked over each shoulder, to make sure that they were alone then\r\nlifted her off the ground (she was no light weight), held her up in the\r\nair like a baby, and gave her a rough loud-sounding kiss on each\r\ncheek. \xe2\x80\x9cWith kind compliments from yours truly!\xe2\x80\x9d he said--and burst out\r\nlaughing, and put her down again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you do that?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Glenarm. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall claim Mrs.\r\nDelamayn\xe2\x80\x99s protection if I am to be insulted in this way! I will never\r\nforgive you, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d As she said those indignant words she shot a look at\r\nhim which flatly contradicted them. The next moment she was leaning on\r\nhis arm, and was looking at him wonderingly, for the thousandth time, as\r\nan entire novelty in her experience of male human kind. \xe2\x80\x9cHow rough\r\nyou are, Geoffrey!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, softly. He smiled in recognition of that\r\nartless homage to the manly virtue of his character. She saw the smile,\r\nand instantly made another effort to dispute the hateful supremacy of\r\nPerry. \xe2\x80\x9cPut him off!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the daughter of Eve, determined to lure\r\nAdam into taking a bite of the apple. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Geoffrey, dear, never mind\r\nPerry, this once. Take me to the lake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey looked at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cPerry expects me in a quarter of an\r\nhour,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s indignation assumed a new form. She burst out crying.\r\nGeoffrey surveyed her for a moment with a broad stare of surprise--and\r\nthen took her by both arms, and shook her!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you coach me through my\r\ntraining?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would if I could!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to do with it! Can you turn me out, fit, on the day of\r\nthe race? Yes? or No?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen dry your eyes and let Perry do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenarm dried her eyes, and made another effort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not fit to be seen,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so agitated, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nto do. Come indoors, Geoffrey--and have a cup of tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cPerry forbids tea,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cin the middle of\r\nthe day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou brute!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Glenarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want me to lose the race?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Geoffrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that answer she left him at last, and ran back into the house.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey took a turn on the terrace--considered a little--stopped--and\r\nlooked at the porch under which the irate widow had disappeared from\r\nhis view. \xe2\x80\x9cTen thousand a year,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, thinking of the matrimonial\r\nprospect which he was placing in peril. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd devilish well earned,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, going into the house, under protest, to appease Mrs. Glenarm.\r\n\r\nThe offended lady was on a sofa, in the solitary drawing-room. Geoffrey\r\nsat down by her. She declined to look at him. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be a fool!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Geoffrey, in his most persuasive manner. Mrs. Glenarm put her\r\nhandkerchief to her eyes. Geoffrey took it away again without ceremony.\r\nMrs. Glenarm rose to leave the room. Geoffrey stopped her by main force.\r\nMrs. Glenarm threatened to summon the servants. Geoffrey said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll\r\nright! I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if the whole house knows I\xe2\x80\x99m fond of you!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nGlenarm looked at the door, and whispered \xe2\x80\x9cHush! for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Geoffrey put her arm in his, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cCome along with me: I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nsomething to say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Glenarm drew back, and shook her head.\r\nGeoffrey put his arm round her waist, and walked her out of the room,\r\nand out of the house--taking the direction, not of the terrace, but of\r\na fir plantation on the opposite side of the grounds. Arrived among the\r\ntrees, he stopped and held up a warning forefinger before the offended\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re just the sort of woman I like,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand there\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t a man living who\xe2\x80\x99s half as sweet on you as I am. You leave off\r\nbullying me about Perry, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do--I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you\r\nsee me take a Sprint.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew back a step, and fixed his big blue eyes on her, with a look\r\nwhich said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a highly-favored woman, if ever there was one yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Curiosity instantly took the leading place among the emotions of Mrs.\r\nGlenarm. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a Sprint, Geoffrey?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA short run, to try me at the top of my speed. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t another\r\nliving soul in all England that I\xe2\x80\x99d let see it but you. _Now_ am I a\r\nbrute?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenarm was conquered again, for the hundredth time at least. She\r\nsaid, softly, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Geoffrey, if you could only be always like this!\xe2\x80\x9d Her\r\neyes lifted themselves admiringly to his. She took his arm again of her\r\nown accord, and pressed it with a loving clasp. Geoffrey prophetically\r\nfelt the ten thousand a year in his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you really love me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n whispered Mrs. Glenarm. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t I!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the hero. The peace was\r\nmade, and the two walked on again.\r\n\r\nThey passed through the plantation, and came out on some open ground,\r\nrising and falling prettily, in little hillocks and hollows. The last\r\nof the hillocks sloped down into a smooth level plain, with a fringe of\r\nsheltering trees on its farther side--with a snug little stone cottage\r\namong the trees--and with a smart little man, walking up and down before\r\nthe cottage, holding his hands behind him. The level plain was the\r\nhero\xe2\x80\x99s exercising ground; the cottage was the hero\xe2\x80\x99s retreat; and the\r\nsmart little man was the hero\xe2\x80\x99s trainer.\r\n\r\nIf Mrs. Glenarm hated Perry, Perry (judging by appearances) was in\r\nno danger of loving Mrs. Glenarm. As Geoffrey approached with his\r\ncompanion, the trainer came to a stand-still, and stared silently at the\r\nlady. The lady, on her side, declined to observe that any such person\r\nas the trainer was then in existence, and present in bodily form on the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about time?\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey.\r\n\r\nPerry consulted an elaborate watch, constructed to mark time to the\r\nfifth of a second, and answered Geoffrey, with his eye all the while on\r\nMrs. Glenarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got five minutes to spare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow me where you run, I\xe2\x80\x99m dying to see it!\xe2\x80\x9d said the eager widow,\r\ntaking possession of Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s arm with both hands.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey led her back to a place (marked by a sapling with a little\r\nflag attached to it) at some short distance from the cottage. She glided\r\nalong by his side, with subtle undulations of movement which appeared\r\nto complete the exasperation of Perry. He waited until she was out of\r\nhearing--and then he invoked (let us say) the blasts of heaven on the\r\nfashionably-dressed head of Mrs. Glenarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou take your place there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey, posting her by the sapling.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I pass you--\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped, and surveyed her with a good-humored\r\nmasculine pity. \xe2\x80\x9cHow the devil am I to make you understand it?\xe2\x80\x9d he went\r\non. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here! when I pass you, it will be at what you would call (if\r\nI was a horse) full gallop. Hold your tongue--I haven\xe2\x80\x99t done yet. You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nto look on after me as I leave you, to where the edge of the cottage\r\nwall cuts the trees. When you have lost sight of me behind the wall,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll have seen me run my three hundred yards from this flag. You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nin luck\xe2\x80\x99s way! Perry tries me at the long Sprint to-day. You understand\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re to stop here? Very well then--let me go and get my toggery on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t I see you again, Geoffrey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t I just told you that you\xe2\x80\x99ll see me run?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--but after that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter that, I\xe2\x80\x99m sponged and rubbed down--and rest in the cottage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll come to us this evening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded, and left her. The face of Perry looked unutterable things\r\nwhen he and Geoffrey met at the door of the cottage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a question to ask you, Mr. Delamayn,\xe2\x80\x9d said the trainer. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou want me? or don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I want you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I say when I first come here?\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Perry, sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t have nobody a looking on at a man I\xe2\x80\x99m training. These\r\nhere ladies and gentlemen may all have made up their minds to see you.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve made up my mind not to have no lookers-on. I won\xe2\x80\x99t have you timed\r\nat your work by nobody but me. I won\xe2\x80\x99t have every blessed yard of ground\r\nyou cover put in the noospapers. I won\xe2\x80\x99t have a living soul in\r\nthe secret of what you can do, and what you can\xe2\x80\x99t, except our two\r\nselves.\xe2\x80\x99--Did I say that, Mr. Delamayn? or didn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I say it? or didn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you did!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen don\xe2\x80\x99t you bring no more women here. It\xe2\x80\x99s clean against rules. And\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAny other living creature adopting this tone of remonstrance would\r\nprobably have had reason to repent it. But Geoffrey himself was afraid\r\nto show his temper in the presence of Perry. In view of the coming race,\r\nthe first and foremost of British trainers was not to be trifled with,\r\neven by the first and foremost of British athletes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe won\xe2\x80\x99t come again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s going away from Swanhaven\r\nin two days\xe2\x80\x99 time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve put every shilling I\xe2\x80\x99m worth in the world on you,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Perry,\r\nrelapsing into tenderness. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I tell you I felt it! It cut me to the\r\nheart when I see you coming along with a woman at your heels. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nfraud on his backers, I says to myself--that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is, a fraud on\r\nhis backers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShut up!\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd come and help me to win your money.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nkicked open the door of the cottage--and athlete and trainer disappeared\r\nfrom view.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting a few minutes by the little flag, Mrs. Glenarm saw the\r\ntwo men approaching her from the cottage. Dressed in a close-fitting\r\ncostume, light and elastic, adapting itself to every movement, and made\r\nto answer every purpose required by the exercise in which he was abo\r\nut to engage, Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s physical advantages showed themselves in their\r\nbest and bravest aspect. His head sat proud and easy on his firm, white\r\nthroat, bared to the air. The rising of his mighty chest, as he drew in\r\ndeep draughts of the fragrant summer breeze; the play of his lithe and\r\nsupple loins; the easy, elastic stride of his straight and shapely\r\nlegs, presented a triumph of physical manhood in its highest type. Mrs.\r\nGlenarm\xe2\x80\x99s eyes devoured him in silent admiration. He looked like a\r\nyoung god of mythology--like a statue animated with color and life. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nGeoffrey!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, softly, as he went by. He neither answered,\r\nnor looked: he had other business on hand than listening to soft\r\nnonsense. He was gathering himself up for the effort; his lips were set;\r\nhis fists were lightly clenched. Perry posted himself at his place, grim\r\nand silent, with the watch in his hand. Geoffrey walked on beyond the\r\nflag, so as to give himself start enough to reach his full speed as he\r\npassed it. \xe2\x80\x9cNow then!\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry. In an instant more, he flew by (to\r\nMrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s excited imagination) like an arrow from a bow. His action\r\nwas perfect. His speed, at its utmost rate of exertion, preserved its\r\nrare underlying elements of strength and steadiness. Less and less and\r\nless he grew to the eyes that followed his course; still lightly flying\r\nover the ground, still firmly keeping the straight line. A moment\r\nmore, and the runner vanished behind the wall of the cottage, and the\r\nstop-watch of the trainer returned to its place in his pocket.\r\n\r\nIn her eagerness to know the result, Mrs. Glenarm forget her jealousy of\r\nPerry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long has he been?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a good many besides you would be glad to know that,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPerry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Delamayn will tell me, you rude man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat depends, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, on whether _I_ tell _him._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith this reply, Perry hurried back to the cottage.\r\n\r\nNot a word passed while the trainer was attending to his man, and while\r\nthe man was recovering his breath. When Geoffrey had been carefully\r\nrubbed down, and clothed again in his ordinary garments, Perry pulled\r\na comfortable easy-chair out of a corner. Geoffrey fell into the\r\nchair, rather than sat down in it. Perry started, and looked at him\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cHow about the time? Long? short? or middling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you say the lady was going, Mr. Delamayn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn two days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Sir. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you \xe2\x80\x98how long\xe2\x80\x99 when the lady\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey made no attempt to insist on an immediate reply. He smiled\r\nfaintly. After an interval of less than ten minutes he stretched out his\r\nlegs and closed his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing to sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey opened his eyes with an effort. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The word had\r\nhardly passed his lips before his eyes closed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo!\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry, watching him. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went closer to the chair. There was no doubt about it. The man was\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nPerry emitted a long whistle under his breath. He stooped and laid two\r\nof his fingers softly on Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s pulse. The beat was slow, heavy, and\r\nlabored. It was unmistakably the pulse of an exhausted man.\r\n\r\nThe trainer changed color, and took a turn in the room. He opened a\r\ncupboard, and produced from it his diary of the preceding year. The\r\nentries relating to the last occasion on which he had prepared Geoffrey\r\nfor a foot-race included the fullest details. He turned to the report\r\nof the first trial, at three hundred yards, full speed. The time was,\r\nby one or two seconds, not so good as the time on this occasion. But the\r\nresult, afterward, was utterly different. There it was, in Perry\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nwords: \xe2\x80\x9cPulse good. Man in high spirits. Ready, if I would have let him,\r\nto run it over again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerry looked round at the same man, a year afterward--utterly worn out,\r\nand fast asleep in the chair.\r\n\r\nHe fetched pen, ink, and paper out of the cupboard, and wrote two\r\nletters--both marked \xe2\x80\x9cPrivate.\xe2\x80\x9d The first was to a medical man, a great\r\nauthority among trainers. The second was to Perry\xe2\x80\x99s own agent in\r\nLondon, whom he knew he could trust. The letter pledged the agent to the\r\nstrictest secrecy, and directed him to back Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s opponent in the\r\nFoot-Race for a sum equal to the sum which Perry had betted on Geoffrey\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have got any money of your own on him,\xe2\x80\x9d the letter\r\nconcluded, \xe2\x80\x9cdo as I do. \xe2\x80\x98Hedge\xe2\x80\x99--and hold your tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother of \xe2\x80\x98em gone stale!\xe2\x80\x9d said the trainer, looking round again at\r\nthe sleeping man. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll lose the race.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRTY-SECOND.\r\n\r\nSEEDS OF THE FUTURE (SECOND SOWING).\r\n\r\nAND what did the visitors say of the Swans?\r\n\r\nThey said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a number of them!\xe2\x80\x9d--which was all that was to be\r\nsaid by persons ignorant of the natural history of aquatic birds.\r\n\r\nAnd what did the visitors say of the lake?\r\n\r\nSome of them said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow solemn!\xe2\x80\x9d Some of them said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow romantic!\xe2\x80\x9d Some\r\nof them said nothing--but privately thought it a dismal scene.\r\n\r\nHere again the popular sentiment struck the right note at starting. The\r\nlake was hidden in the centre of a fir wood. Except in the middle, where\r\nthe sunlight reached them, the waters lay black under the sombre shadow\r\nof the trees. The one break in the plantation was at the farther end of\r\nthe lake. The one sign of movement and life to be seen was the ghostly\r\ngliding of the swans on the dead-still surface of the water. It was\r\nsolemn--as they said; it was romantic--as they said. It was dismal--as\r\nthey thought. Pages of description could express no more. Let pages of\r\ndescription be absent, therefore, in this place.\r\n\r\nHaving satiated itself with the swans, having exhausted the lake, the\r\ngeneral curiosity reverted to the break in the trees at the farther\r\nend--remarked a startlingly artificial object, intruding itself on the\r\nscene, in the shape of a large red curtain, which hung between two of\r\nthe tallest firs, and closed the prospect beyond from view--requested an\r\nexplanation of the curtain from Julius Delamayn--and received for answer\r\nthat the mystery should be revealed on the arrival of his wife with the\r\ntardy remainder of the guests who had loitered about the house.\r\n\r\nOn the appearance of Mrs. Delamayn and the stragglers, the united party\r\ncoasted the shore of the lake, and stood assembled in front of the\r\ncurtain. Pointing to the silken cords hanging at either side of it,\r\nJulius Delamayn picked out two little girls (children of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsister), and sent them to the cords, with instructions to pull, and\r\nsee what happened. The nieces of Julius pulled with the eager hands\r\nof children in the presence of a mystery--the curtains parted in the\r\nmiddle, and a cry of universal astonishment and delight saluted the\r\nscene revealed to view.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a broad avenue of firs a cool green glade spread its\r\ngrassy carpet in the midst of the surrounding plantation. The ground\r\nat the farther end of the glade rose; and here, on the lower slopes,\r\na bright little spring of water bubbled out between gray old granite\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nAlong the right-hand edge of the turf ran a row of tables, arrayed in\r\nspotless white, and covered with refreshments waiting for the guests. On\r\nthe opposite side was a band of music, which burst into harmony at the\r\nmoment when the curtains were drawn. Looking back through the avenue,\r\nthe eye caught a distant glimpse of the lake, where the sunlight played\r\non the water, and the plumage of the gliding swans flashed softly in\r\nbrilliant white. Such was the charming surprise which Julius Delamayn\r\nhad arranged for his friends. It was only at moments like these--or when\r\nhe and his wife were playing Sonatas in the modest little music-room\r\nat Swanhaven--that Lord Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s eldest son was really happy.\r\nHe secretly groaned over the duties which his position as a landed\r\ngentleman imposed upon him; and he suffered under some of the highest\r\nprivileges of his rank and station as under social martyrdom in its\r\ncruelest form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll dine first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julius, \xe2\x80\x9cand dance afterward. There is the\r\nprogramme!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led the way to the tables, with the two ladies nearest to\r\nhim--utterly careless whether they were or were not among the ladies of\r\nthe highest rank then present. To Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment he took the\r\nfirst seat he came to, without appearing to care what place he occupied\r\nat his own feast. The guests, following his example, sat where they\r\npleased, reckless of precedents and dignities. Mrs. Delamayn, feeling\r\na special interest in a young lady who was shortly to be a bride, took\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s arm. Lady Lundie attached herself resolutely to her hostess\r\non the other side. The three sat together. Mrs. Delamayn did her best to\r\nencourage Blanche to talk, and Blanche did her best to meet the advances\r\nmade to her. The experiment succeeded but poorly on either side. Mrs.\r\nDelamayn gave it up in despair, and turned to Lady Lundie, with a\r\nstrong suspicion that some unpleasant subject of reflection was preying\r\nprivately on the bride\xe2\x80\x99s mind. The conclusion was soundly drawn.\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s little outbreak of temper with her friend on the terrace, and\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s present deficiency of gayety and spirit, were attributable to\r\nthe same cause. She hid it from her uncle, she hid it from Arnold--but\r\nshe was as anxious as ever, and as wretched as ever, about Anne; and she\r\nwas still on the watch (no matter what Sir Patrick might say or do) to\r\nseize the first opportunity of renewing the search for her lost friend.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the eating, the drinking, and the talking went merrily on.\r\nThe band played its liveliest melodies; the servants kept the glasses\r\nconstantly filled: round all the tables gayety and freedom reigned\r\nsupreme. The one conversation in progress, in which the talkers were\r\nnot in social harmony with each other, was the conversation at Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside, between her step-mother and Mrs. Delamayn.\r\n\r\nAmong Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s other accomplishments the power of making\r\ndisagreeable discoveries ranked high. At the dinner in the glade she had\r\nnot failed to notice--what every body else had passed over--the absence\r\nat the festival of the hostess\xe2\x80\x99s brother-in-law; and more remarkable\r\nstill, the disappearance of a lady who was actually one of the guests\r\nstaying in the house: in plainer words, the disappearance of Mrs.\r\nGlenarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I mistaken?\xe2\x80\x9d said her ladyship, lifting her eye-glass, and looking\r\nround the tables. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely there is a member of our party missing? I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeoffrey promised to be here. But he is not particularly attentive, as\r\nyou may have noticed, to keeping engagements of this sort. Every thing\r\nis sacrificed to his training. We only see him at rare intervals now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that reply Mrs. Delamayn attempted to change the subject. Lady\r\nLundie lifted her eye-glass, and looked round the tables for the second\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted her ladyship--\xe2\x80\x9cbut is it possible that I have\r\ndiscovered another absentee? I don\xe2\x80\x99t see Mrs. Glenarm. Yet surely she\r\nmust be here! Mrs. Glenarm is not training for a foot-race. Do you see\r\nher? _I_ don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI missed her when we went out on the terrace, and I have not seen her\r\nsince.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it very odd, dear Mrs. Delamayn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur guests at Swanhaven, Lady Lundie, have perfect liberty to do as\r\nthey please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn those words Mrs. Delamayn (as she fondly imagined) dismissed the\r\nsubject. But Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s robust curiosity proved unassailable by even\r\nthe broadest hint. Carried away, in all probability, by the infection\r\nof merriment about her, her ladyship displayed unexpected reserves of\r\nvivacity. The mind declines to realize it; but it is not the less true\r\nthat this majestic woman actually simpered!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we put two and two together?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Lundie, with a ponderous\r\nplayfulness wonderful to see. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, on the one hand, is Mr. Geoffrey\r\nDelamayn--a young single man. And here, on the other, is Mrs. Glenarm--a\r\nyoung widow. Rank on the side of the young single man; riches on the\r\nside of the young widow. And both mysteriously absent at the same time,\r\nfrom the same pleasant party. Ha, Mrs. Delamayn! should I guess wrong,\r\nif I guessed that _you_ will have a marriage in the family, too, before\r\nlong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Delamayn looked a little annoyed. She had entered, with all her\r\nheart, into the conspiracy for making a match between Geoffrey and Mrs.\r\nGlenarm. But she was not prepared to own that the lady\xe2\x80\x99s facility\r\nhad (in spite of all attempts to conceal it from discovery) made the\r\nconspiracy obviously successful in ten days\xe2\x80\x99 time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not in the secrets of the lady and gentleman whom you mention,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she replied, dryly.\r\n\r\nA heavy body is slow to acquire movement--and slow to abandon movement,\r\nwhen once acquired. The playfulness of Lady Lundie, being essentially\r\nheavy, followed the same rule. She still persisted in being as lively as\r\never.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a diplomatic answer!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed her ladyship. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I can\r\ninterpret it, though, for all that. A little bird tells me that I shall\r\nsee a Mrs. Geoffrey Delamayn in London, next season. And I, for one,\r\nshall not be surprised to find myself congratulating Mrs. Glenarm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you persist in letting your imagination run away with you, Lady\r\nLundie, I can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly help it. I can only request permission to keep\r\nthe bridle on _mine._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time, even Lady Lundie understood that it would be wise to say\r\nno more. She smiled and nodded, in high private approval of her own\r\nextraordinary cleverness. If she had been asked at that moment who was\r\nthe most brilliant Englishwoman living, she would have looked inward on\r\nherself--and would have seen, as in a glass brightly, Lady Lundie, of\r\nWindygates.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when the talk at her side entered on the subject of\r\nGeoffrey Delamayn and Mrs. Glenarm--and throughout the brief period\r\nduring which it remained occupied with that topic--Blanche became\r\nconscious of a strong smell of some spirituous liquor wafted down on\r\nher, as she fancied, from behind and from above. Finding the odor grow\r\nstronger and stronger, she looked round to see whether any special\r\nmanufacture of grog was proceeding inexplicably at the back of her\r\nchair. The moment she moved her head, her attention was claimed by a\r\npair of tremulous gouty old hands, offering her a grouse pie, profusely\r\nsprinkled with truffles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, my bonny Miss!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered a persuasive voice at her ear, \xe2\x80\x9cye\xe2\x80\x99re\r\njoost stairving in a land o\xe2\x80\x99 plenty. Tak\xe2\x80\x99 my advice, and ye\xe2\x80\x99ll tak\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nbest thing at tebble--groose-poy, and trufflers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche looked up.\r\n\r\nThere he was--the man of the canny eye, the fatherly manner, and the\r\nmighty nose--Bishopriggs--preserved in spirits and ministering at the\r\nfestival at Swanhaven Lodge!\r\n\r\nBlanche had only seen him for a moment on the memorable night of the\r\nstorm, when she had surprised Anne at the inn. But instants passed in\r\nthe society of Bishopriggs were as good as hours spent in the company of\r\ninferior men. Blanche instantly recognized him; instantly called to\r\nmind Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s conviction that he was in possession of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlost letter; instantly rushed to the conclusion that, in discovering\r\nBishopriggs, she had discovered a chance of tracing Anne. Her first\r\nimpulse was to claim acquaintance with him on the spot. But the eyes of\r\nher neighbors were on her, warning her to wait. She took a little of the\r\npie, and looked hard at Bishopriggs. That discreet man, showing no sign\r\nof recognition on his side, bowed respectfully, and went on round the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder whether he has got the letter about him?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Blanche.\r\n\r\nHe had not only got the letter about him--but, more than that, he was\r\nactually then on the look-out for the means of turning the letter to\r\nprofitable pecuniary account.\r\n\r\nThe domestic establishment of Swanhaven Lodge included no formidable\r\narray of servants. When Mrs. Delamayn gave a large party, she depended\r\nfor such additional assistance as was needed partly on the contributions\r\nof her friends, partly on the resources of the principal inn at\r\nKirkandrew. Mr. Bishopriggs, serving at the time (in the absence of any\r\nbetter employment) as a supernumerary at the inn, made one among the\r\nwaiters who could be spared to assist at the garden-party. The name of\r\nthe gentleman by whom he was to be employed for the day had struck him,\r\nwhen he first heard it, as having a familiar sound. He had made his\r\ninquiries; and had then betaken himself for additional information, to\r\nthe letter which he had picked up from the parlor floor at Craig Fernie.\r\n\r\nThe sheet of note-paper, lost by Anne, contained, it may be remembered,\r\ntwo letters--one signed by herself; the other signed by Geoffrey--and\r\nboth suggestive, to a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s eye, of relations between the writers\r\nwhich they were interested in concealing from the public view.\r\n\r\nThinking it just possible--if he kept his eyes and ears well open at\r\nSwanhaven--that he might improve his prospect of making a marketable\r\ncommodity of the stolen correspondence, Mr. Bishopriggs had put the\r\nletter in his pocket when he left Kirkandrew. He had recognized Blanche,\r\nas a friend of the lady at the inn--and as a person who might perhaps be\r\nturned to account, in that capacity. And he had, moreover, heard every\r\nword of the conversation between Lady Lundie and Mrs. Delamayn on the\r\nsubject of Geoffrey and Mrs. Glenarm. There were hours to be passed\r\nbefore the guests would retire, and before the waiters would be\r\ndismissed. The conviction was strong in the mind of Mr. Bishopriggs that\r\nhe might find good reason yet for congratulating himself on the chance\r\nwhich had associated him with the festivities at Swanhaven Lodge.\r\n\r\nIt was still early in the afternoon when the gayety at the dinner-table\r\nbegan, in certain quarters, to show signs of wearing out.\r\n\r\nThe younger members of the party--especially the ladies--grew restless\r\nwith the appearance of the dessert. One after another they looked\r\nlongingly at the smooth level of elastic turf in the middle of the\r\nglade. One after another they beat time absently with their fingers\r\nto the waltz which the musicians happened to be playing at the moment.\r\nNoticing these symptoms, Mrs. Delamayn set the example of rising; and\r\nher husband sent a message to the band. In ten minutes more the\r\nfirst quadrille was in progress on the grass; the spectators were\r\npicturesquely grouped round, looking on; and the servants and waiters,\r\nno longer wanted, had retired out of sight, to a picnic of their own.\r\n\r\nThe last person to leave the deserted tables was the venerable\r\nBishopriggs. He alone, of the men in attendance, had contrived to\r\ncombine a sufficient appearance of waiting on the company with a\r\nclandestine attention to his own personal need of refreshment. Instead\r\nof hurrying away to the servants\xe2\x80\x99 dinner with the rest, he made the\r\nround of the tables, apparently clearing away the crumbs--actually,\r\nemptying the wine-glasses. Immersed in this occupation, he was startled\r\nby a lady\xe2\x80\x99s voice behind him, and, turning as quickly as he could, found\r\nhimself face to face with Miss Lundie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want some cold water,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cBe so good as to get me some\r\nfrom the spring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the bubbling rivulet at the farther end of the glade.\r\n\r\nBishopriggs looked unaffectedly shocked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord\xe2\x80\x99s sake, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed \xe2\x80\x9cd\xe2\x80\x99ye relly mean to offend yer stomach\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 cauld water--when there\xe2\x80\x99s wine to be had for the asking!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche gave him a look. Slowness of perception was not on the list of\r\nthe failings of Bishopriggs. He took up a tumbler, winked with his\r\none available eye, and led the way to the rivulet. There was nothing\r\nremarkable in the spectacle of a young lady who wanted a glass of\r\nspring-water, or of a waiter who was getting it for her. Nobody was\r\nsurprised; and (with the band playing) nobody could by any chance\r\noverhear what might be said at the spring-side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember me at the inn on the night of the storm?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nBlanche.\r\n\r\nMr. Bishopriggs had his reasons (carefully inclosed in his pocketbook)\r\nfor not being too ready to commit himself with Blanche at starting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no\xe2\x80\x99 saying I canna remember ye, miss. Whar\xe2\x80\x99s the man would mak\xe2\x80\x99 sic\r\nan answer as that to a bonny young leddy like you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy way of assisting his memory Blanche took out her purse. Bishopriggs\r\nbecame absorbed in the scenery. He looked at the running water with the\r\neye of a man who thoroughly distrusted it, viewed as a beverage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere ye go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing himself to the rivulet, \xe2\x80\x9cbubblin\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\nyer ain annihilation in the loch yonder! It\xe2\x80\x99s little I know that\xe2\x80\x99s gude\r\naboot ye, in yer unconvairted state. Ye\xe2\x80\x99re a type o\xe2\x80\x99 human life, they\r\nsay. I tak\xe2\x80\x99 up my testimony against _that._ Ye\xe2\x80\x99re a type o\xe2\x80\x99 naething\r\nat all till ye\xe2\x80\x99re heated wi\xe2\x80\x99 fire, and sweetened wi\xe2\x80\x99 sugar, and\r\nstrengthened wi\xe2\x80\x99 whusky; and then ye\xe2\x80\x99re a type o\xe2\x80\x99 toddy--and human life\r\n(I grant it) has got something to say to ye in that capacity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard more about you, since I was at the inn,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded\r\nBlanche, \xe2\x80\x9cthan you may suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d (She opened her purse: Mr. Bishopriggs\r\nbecame the picture of attention.) \xe2\x80\x9cYou were very, very kind to a lady\r\nwho was staying at Craig Fernie,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cI know that\r\nyou have lost your place at the inn, because you gave all your attention\r\nto that lady. She is my dearest friend, Mr. Bishopriggs. I want to thank\r\nyou. I do thank you. Please accept what I have got here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the girl\xe2\x80\x99s heart was in her eyes and in her voice as she emptied her\r\npurse into the gouty (and greedy) old hand of Bishopriggs.\r\n\r\nA young lady with a well-filled purse (no matter how rich the young\r\nlady may be) is a combination not often witnessed in any country on the\r\ncivilized earth. Either the money is always spent, or the money has\r\nbeen forgotten on the toilet-table at home. Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s purse contained a\r\nsovereign and some six or seven shillings in silver. As pocket-money for\r\nan heiress it was contemptible. But as a gratuity to Bishopriggs it was\r\nmagnificent. The old rascal put the money into his pocket with one hand,\r\nand dashed away the tears of sensibility, which he had _not_ shed, with\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCast yer bread on the waters,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Bishopriggs, with his one eye\r\nraised devotionally to the sky, \xe2\x80\x9cand ye sall find it again after monny\r\ndays! Heeh! hech! didna I say when I first set eyes on that puir leddy,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I feel like a fether to ye?\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s seemply mairvelous to see hoo a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nain gude deeds find him oot in this lower warld o\xe2\x80\x99 ours. If ever I heard\r\nthe voice o\xe2\x80\x99 naitural affection speaking in my ain breast,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mr.\r\nBishopriggs, with his eye fixed in uneasy expectation on Blanche, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\njoost spak\xe2\x80\x99 trumpet-tongued when that winsome creature first lookit at\r\nme. Will it be she now that told ye of the wee bit sairvice I rendered\r\nto her in the time when I was in bondage at the hottle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--she told me herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight I mak\xe2\x80\x99 sae bauld as to ask whar\xe2\x80\x99 she may be at the present time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Mr. Bishopriggs. I am more miserable about it than I can\r\nsay. She has gone away--and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOw! ow! that\xe2\x80\x99s bad. And the bit husband-creature danglin\xe2\x80\x99 at her\r\npetticoat\xe2\x80\x99s tail one day, and awa\xe2\x80\x99 wi\xe2\x80\x99 the sunrise next mornin\xe2\x80\x99--have\r\nthey baith taken leg-bail together?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing of him; I never saw him. You saw him. Tell me--what was\r\nhe like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! he was joost a puir weak creature. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t know a glass o\xe2\x80\x99 good\r\nsherry-wine when he\xe2\x80\x99d got it. Free wi\xe2\x80\x99 the siller--that\xe2\x80\x99s a\xe2\x80\x99 ye can say\r\nfor him--free wi\xe2\x80\x99 the siller!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFinding it impossible to extract from Mr. Bishopriggs any clearer\r\ndescription of the man who had been with Anne at the inn than this,\r\nBlanche approached the main object of the interview. Too anxious to\r\nwaste time in circumlocution, she turned the conversation at once to the\r\ndelicate and doubtful subject of the lost letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is something else that I want to say to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nfriend had a loss while she was staying at the inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe clouds of doubt rolled off the mind of Mr. Bishopriggs. The lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriend knew of the lost letter. And, better still, the lady\xe2\x80\x99s friend\r\nlooked as if she wanted it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! ay!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with all due appearance of carelessness. \xe2\x80\x9cLike\r\neneugh. From the mistress downward, they\xe2\x80\x99re a\xe2\x80\x99 kittle cattle at the inn\r\nsince I\xe2\x80\x99ve left \xe2\x80\x98em. What may it ha\xe2\x80\x99 been that she lost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe lost a letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe look of uneasy expectation reappeared in the eye of Mr. Bishopriggs.\r\nIt was a question--and a serious question, from his point of\r\nview--whether any suspicion of theft was attached to the disappearance\r\nof the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen ye say \xe2\x80\x98lost,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cd\xe2\x80\x99ye mean stolen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche was quite quick enough to see the necessity of quieting his mind\r\non this point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no!\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cNot stolen. Only lost. Did you hear about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWherefore suld _I_ ha\xe2\x80\x99 heard aboot it?\xe2\x80\x9d He looked hard at Blanche--and\r\ndetected a momentary hesitation in her face. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me this, my young\r\nleddy,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, advancing warily near to the point. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen ye\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nspeering for news o\xe2\x80\x99 your friend\xe2\x80\x99s lost letter--what sets ye on comin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nto _me?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose words were decisive. It is hardly too much to say that Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfuture depended on Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s answer to that question.\r\n\r\nIf she could have produced the money; and if she had said, boldly, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nhave got the letter, Mr. Bishopriggs: I pledge my word that no questions\r\nshall be asked, and I offer you ten pounds for it\xe2\x80\x9d--in all probability\r\nthe bargain would have been struck; and the whole course of coming\r\nevents would, in that case, have been altered. But she had no money\r\nleft; and there were no friends, in the circle at Swanhaven, to whom she\r\ncould apply, without being misinterpreted, for a loan of ten pounds,\r\nto be privately intrusted to her on the spot. Under stress of sheer\r\nnecessity Blanche abandoned all hope of making any present appeal of a\r\npecuniary nature to the confidence of Bishopriggs.\r\n\r\nThe one other way of attaining her object that she could see was to arm\r\nherself with the influence of Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s name. A man, placed in her\r\nposition, would have thought it mere madness to venture on such a\r\nrisk as this. But Blanche--with one act of rashness already on her\r\nconscience--rushed, woman-like, straight to the commission of another.\r\nThe same headlong eagerness to reach her end, which had hurried her into\r\nquestioning Geoffrey before he left Windygates, now drove her, just\r\nas recklessly, into taking the management of Bishopriggs out of Sir\r\nPatrick\xe2\x80\x99s skilled and practiced hands. The starving sisterly love in her\r\nhungered for a trace of Anne. Her heart whispered, Risk it! And Blanche\r\nrisked it on the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick set me on coming to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThe opening hand of Mr. Bishopriggs--ready to deliver the letter, and\r\nreceive the reward--closed again instantly as she spoke those words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Paitrick?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated \xe2\x80\x9cOw! ow! ye\xe2\x80\x99ve een tauld Sir Paitrick aboot\r\nit, have ye? There\xe2\x80\x99s a chiel wi\xe2\x80\x99 a lang head on his shouthers, if ever\r\nthere was ane yet! What might Sir Paitrick ha\xe2\x80\x99 said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche noticed a change in his tone. Blanche was rigidly careful (when\r\nit was too late) to answer him in guarded terms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick thought you might have found the letter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nmight not have remembered about it again until after you had left the\r\ninn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBishopriggs looked back into his own personal experience of his old\r\nmaster--and drew the correct conclusion that Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s view of\r\nhis connection with the disappearance of the letter was not the purely\r\nunsuspicious view reported by Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cThe dour auld deevil,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cknows me better than _that!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Blanche, impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cIs Sir Patrick right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRicht?\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Bishopriggs, briskly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s as far awa\xe2\x80\x99 from the truth\r\nas John o\xe2\x80\x99 Groat\xe2\x80\x99s House is from Jericho.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know nothing of the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeil a bit I know o\xe2\x80\x99 the letter. The first I ha\xe2\x80\x99 heard o\xe2\x80\x99 it is what I\r\nhear noo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s heart sank within her. Had she defeated her own object, and\r\ncut the ground from under Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s feet, for the second time?\r\nSurely not! There was unquestionably a chance, on this occasion, that\r\nthe man might be prevailed upon to place the trust in her uncle which\r\nhe was too cautious to confide to a stranger like herself. The one wise\r\nthing to do now was to pave the way for the exertion of Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuperior influence, and Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s superior skill. She resumed the\r\nconversation with that object in view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to hear that Sir Patrick has guessed wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend was anxious to recover the letter when I last saw her; and I\r\nhoped to hear news of it from you. However, right or wrong, Sir Patrick\r\nhas some reasons for wishing to see you--and I take the opportunity of\r\ntelling you so. He has left a letter to wait for you at the Craig Fernie\r\ninn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m thinking the letter will ha\xe2\x80\x99 lang eneugh to wait, if it waits till\r\nI gae back for it to the hottle,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Bishopriggs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche, promptly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou had better give me an\r\naddress at which Sir Patrick can write to you. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, I suppose,\r\nwish me to say that I had seen you here, and that you refused to\r\ncommunicate with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever think it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bishopriggs, fervently. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s ain thing\r\nmair than anither that I\xe2\x80\x99m carefu\xe2\x80\x99 to presairve intact, it\xe2\x80\x99s joost the\r\nrespectful attention that I owe to Sir Paitrick. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make sae bauld,\r\nmiss, au to chairge ye wi\xe2\x80\x99 that bit caird. I\xe2\x80\x99m no\xe2\x80\x99 settled in ony place\r\nyet (mair\xe2\x80\x99s the pity at my time o\xe2\x80\x99 life!), but Sir Paitrick may hear o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nme, when Sir Paitrick has need o\xe2\x80\x99 me, there.\xe2\x80\x9d He handed a dirty\r\nlittle card to Blanche containing the name and address of a butcher in\r\nEdinburgh. \xe2\x80\x9cSawmuel Bishopriggs,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, glibly. \xe2\x80\x9cCare o\xe2\x80\x99 Davie\r\nDow, flesher; Cowgate; Embro. My Patmos in the weelderness, miss, for\r\nthe time being.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche received the address with a sense of unspeakable relief. If\r\nshe had once more ventured on taking Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s place, and once\r\nmore failed in justifying her rashness by the results, she had at\r\nleast gained some atoning advantage, this time, by opening a means of\r\ncommunication between her uncle and Bishopriggs. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will hear from Sir\r\nPatrick,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and nodded kindly, and returned to her place among\r\nthe guests.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from Sir Paitrick, wull I?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Bishopriggs when he was\r\nleft by himself. \xe2\x80\x9cSir Paitrick will wark naething less than a meeracle\r\nif he finds Sawmuel Bishopriggs at the Cowgate, Embro!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed softly over his own cleverness; and withdrew to a lonely\r\nplace in the plantation, in which he could consult the stolen\r\ncorrespondence without fear of being observed by any living creature.\r\nOnce more the truth had tried to struggle into light, before the day of\r\nthe marriage, and once more Blanche had innocently helped the darkness\r\nto keep it from view.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRTY-THIRD.\r\n\r\nSEEDS OF THE FUTURE (THIRD SOWING).\r\n\r\nAFTER a new and attentive reading of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s letter to Geoffrey, and of\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s letter to Anne, Bishopriggs laid down comfortably under a\r\ntree, and set himself the task of seeing his position plainly as it was\r\nat that moment.\r\n\r\nThe profitable disposal of the correspondence to Blanche was no longer\r\namong the possibilities involved in the case. As for treating with Sir\r\nPatrick, Bishopriggs determined to keep equally dear of the Cowgate,\r\nEdinburgh, and of Mrs. Inchbare\xe2\x80\x99s inn, so long as there was the faintest\r\nchance of his pushing his own interests in any other quarter. No person\r\nliving would be capable of so certainly extracting the correspondence\r\nfrom him, on such ruinously cheap terms as his old master. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll no\xe2\x80\x99 put\r\nmyself under Sir Paitrick\xe2\x80\x99s thumb,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Bishopriggs, \xe2\x80\x9ctill I\xe2\x80\x99ve gane\r\nmy ain rounds among the lave o\xe2\x80\x99 them first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRendered into intelligible English, this resolution pledged him to hold\r\nno communication with Sir Patrick--until he had first tested his success\r\nin negotiating with other persons, who might be equally interested in\r\ngetting possession of the correspondence, and more liberal in giving\r\nhush-money to the thief who had stolen it.\r\n\r\nWho were the \xe2\x80\x9cother persons\xe2\x80\x9d at his disposal, under these circumstances?\r\n\r\nHe had only to recall the conversation which he had overheard between\r\nLady Lundie and Mrs. Delamayn to arrive at the discovery of one person,\r\nto begin with, who was directly interested in getting possession of his\r\nown letter. Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn was in a fair way of being married to\r\na lady named Mrs. Glenarm. And here was this same Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn\r\nin matrimonial correspondence, little more than a fortnight since, with\r\nanother lady--who signed herself \xe2\x80\x9cAnne Silvester.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhatever his position between the two women might be, his interest in\r\npossessing himself of the correspondence was plain beyond all doubt. It\r\nwas equally clear that the first thing to be done by Bishopriggs was\r\nto find the means of obtaining a personal interview with him. If the\r\ninterview led to nothing else, it would decide one important question\r\nwhich still remained to be solved. The lady whom Bishopriggs had waited\r\non at Craig Fernie might well be \xe2\x80\x9cAnne Silvester.\xe2\x80\x9d Was Mr. Geoffrey\r\nDelamayn, in that case, the gentleman who had passed as her husband at\r\nthe inn?\r\n\r\nBishopriggs rose to his gouty feet with all possible alacrity, and\r\nhobbled away to make the necessary inquiries, addressing himself, not to\r\nthe men-servants at the dinner-table, who would be sure to insist on\r\nhis joining them, but to the women-servants left in charge of the empty\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nHe easily obtained the necessary directions for finding the cottage. But\r\nhe was warned that Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s trainer allowed nobody to see\r\nhis patron at exercise, and that he would certainly be ordered off again\r\nthe moment he appeared on the scene.\r\n\r\nBearing this caution in mind, Bishopriggs made a circuit, on reaching\r\nthe open ground, so as to approach the cottage at the back, under\r\nshelter of the trees behind it. One look at Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn was\r\nall that he wanted in the first instance. They were welcome to order him\r\noff again, as long as he obtained that.\r\n\r\nHe was still hesitating at the outer line of the trees, when he heard a\r\nloud, imperative voice, calling from the front of the cottage, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mr.\r\nGeoffrey! Time\xe2\x80\x99s up!\xe2\x80\x9d Another voice answered, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right!\xe2\x80\x9d and, after an\r\ninterval, Geoffrey Delamayn appeared on the open ground, proceeding to\r\nthe point from which he was accustomed to walk his measured mile.\r\n\r\nAdvancing a few steps to look at his man more closely, Bishopriggs\r\nwas instantly detected by the quick eye of the trainer. \xe2\x80\x9cHullo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nPerry, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you want here?\xe2\x80\x9d Bishopriggs opened his lips to make an\r\nexcuse. \xe2\x80\x9cWho the devil are you?\xe2\x80\x9d roared Geoffrey. The trainer answered\r\nthe question out of the resources of his own experience. \xe2\x80\x9cA spy,\r\nSir--sent to time you at your work.\xe2\x80\x9d Geoffrey lifted his mighty fist,\r\nand sprang forward a step. Perry held his patron back. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nthat, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthe man\xe2\x80\x99s too old. No fear of his turning up\r\nagain--you\xe2\x80\x99ve scared him out of his wits.\xe2\x80\x9d The statement was strictly\r\ntrue. The terror of Bishopriggs at the sight of Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s fist restored\r\nto him the activity of his youth. He ran for the first time for twenty\r\nyears; and only stopped to remember his infirmities, and to catch his\r\nbreath, when he was out of sight of the cottage, among the trees.\r\n\r\nHe sat down to rest and recover himself, with the comforting inner\r\nconviction that, in one respect at least, he had gained his point.\r\nThe furious savage, with the eyes that darted fire and the fist that\r\nthreatened destruction, was a total stranger to him. In other words,\r\n_not_ the man who had passed as the lady\xe2\x80\x99s husband at the inn.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it was equally certain that he _was_ the man involved\r\nin the compromising correspondence which Bishopriggs possessed. To\r\nappeal, however, to his interest in obtaining the letter was entirely\r\nincompatible (after the recent exhibition of his fist) with the strong\r\nregard which Bishopriggs felt for his own personal security. There was\r\nno alternative now but to open negotiations with the one other person\r\nconcerned in the matter (fortunately, on this occasion, a person of\r\nthe gentler sex), who was actually within reach. Mrs. Glenarm was at\r\nSwanhaven. She had a direct interest in clearing up the question of a\r\nprior claim to Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn on the part of another woman. And\r\nshe could only do that by getting the correspondence into her own hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPraise Providence for a\xe2\x80\x99 its mercies!\xe2\x80\x9d said Bishopriggs, getting on his\r\nfeet again. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got twa strings, as they say, to my boo. I trow the\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s the canny string o\xe2\x80\x99 the twa--and we\xe2\x80\x99ll een try the twanging of\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe set forth on his road back again, to search among the company at the\r\nlake for Mrs. Glenarm.\r\n\r\nThe dance had reached its climax of animation when Bishopriggs\r\nreappeared on the scene of his duties; and the ranks of the company had\r\nbeen recruited, in his absence, by the very person whom it was now his\r\nforemost object to approach.\r\n\r\nReceiving, with supple submission, a reprimand for his prolonged absence\r\nfrom the chief of the servants, Bishopriggs--keeping his one observant\r\neye carefully on the look-out--busied himself in promoting the\r\ncirculation of ices and cool drinks.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus occupied, his attention was attracted by two persons\r\nwho, in very different ways, stood out prominently as marked characters\r\namong the rank and file of the guests.\r\n\r\nThe first person was a vivacious, irascible old gentleman, who\r\npersisted in treating the undeniable fact of his age on the footing of a\r\nscandalous false report set afloat by Time. He was superbly strapped\r\nand padded. His hair, his teeth, and his complexion were triumphs of\r\nartificial youth. When he was not occupied among the youngest women\r\npresent--which was very seldom--he attached himself exclusively to the\r\nyoungest men. He insisted on joining every dance. Twice he measured his\r\nlength upon the grass, but nothing daunted him. He was waltzing again,\r\nwith another young woman, at the next dance, as if nothing had happened.\r\nInquiring who this effervescent old gentleman might be, Bishopriggs\r\ndiscovered that he was a retired officer in the navy; commonly known\r\n(among his inferiors) as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Tartar;\xe2\x80\x9d more formally described in\r\nsociety as Captain Newenden, the last male representative of one of the\r\noldest families in England.\r\n\r\nThe second person, who appeared to occupy a position of distinction at\r\nthe dance in the glade, was a lady.\r\n\r\nTo the eye of Bishopriggs, she was a miracle of beauty, with a small\r\nfortune for a poor man carried about her in silk, lace, and jewelry. No\r\nwoman present was the object of such special attention among the men as\r\nthis fascinating and priceless creature. She sat fanning herself with\r\na matchless work of art (supposed to be a handkerchief) representing an\r\nisland of cambric in the midst of an ocean of lace. She was surrounded\r\nby a little court of admirers, who fetched and carried at her slightest\r\nnod, like well-trained dogs. Sometimes they brought refreshments, which\r\nshe had asked for, only to decline taking them when they came. Sometimes\r\nthey brought information of what was going on among the dancers, which\r\nthe lady had been eager to receive when they went away, and in which she\r\nhad ceased to feel the smallest interest when they came back. Every body\r\nburst into ejaculations of distress when she was asked to account for\r\nher absence from the dinner, and answered, \xe2\x80\x9cMy poor nerves.\xe2\x80\x9d Every body\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat should we have done without you!\xe2\x80\x9d--when she doubted if she\r\nhad done wisely in joining the party at all. Inquiring who this favored\r\nlady might be, Bishopriggs discovered that she was the niece of the\r\nindomitable old gentleman who _would_ dance--or, more plainly still, no\r\nless a person than his contemplated customer, Mrs. Glenarm.\r\n\r\nWith all his enormous assurance Bishopriggs was daunted when he found\r\nhimself facing the question of what he was to do next.\r\n\r\nTo open negotiations with Mrs. Glenarm, under present circumstances,\r\nwas, for a man in his position, simply impossible. But, apart from this,\r\nthe prospect of profitably addressing himself to that lady in the future\r\nwas, to say the least of it, beset with difficulties of no common kind.\r\n\r\nSupposing the means of disclosing Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s position to her to be\r\nfound--what would she do, when she received her warning? She would in\r\nall probability apply to one of two formidable men, both of whom were\r\ninterested in the matter. If she went straight to the man accused\r\nof attempting to marry her, at a time when he was already engaged to\r\nanother woman--Bishopriggs would find himself confronted with the owner\r\nof that terrible fist, which had justly terrified him even on a distant\r\nand cursory view. If, on the other hand she placed her interests in the\r\ncare of her uncle--Bishopriggs had only to look at the captain, and to\r\ncalculate his chance of imposing terms on a man who owed Life a bill of\r\nmore than sixty years\xe2\x80\x99 date, and who openly defied time to recover the\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nWith these serious obstacles standing in the way, what was to be done?\r\nThe only alternative left was to approach Mrs. Glenarm under shelter of\r\nthe dark.\r\n\r\nReaching this conclusion, Bishopriggs decided to ascertain from the\r\nservants what the lady\xe2\x80\x99s future movements might be; and, thus informed,\r\nto startle her by anonymous warnings, conveyed through the post, and\r\nclaiming their answer through the advertising channel of a newspaper.\r\nHere was the certainty of alarming her, coupled with the certainty of\r\nsafety to himself! Little did Mrs. Glenarm dream, when she capriciously\r\nstopped a servant going by with some glasses of lemonade, that the\r\nwretched old creature who offered the tray contemplated corresponding\r\nwith her before the week was out, in the double character of her\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell-Wisher\xe2\x80\x9d and her \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe evening advanced. The shadows lengthened. The waters of the lake\r\ngrew pitchy black. The gliding of the ghostly swans became rare and more\r\nrare. The elders of the party thought of the drive home. The juniors\r\n(excepting Captain Newenden) began to flag at the dance. Little by\r\nlittle the comfortable attractions of the house--tea, coffee, and\r\ncandle-light in snug rooms--resumed their influence. The guests\r\nabandoned the glade; and the fingers and lungs of the musicians rested\r\nat last.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie and her party were the first to send for the carriage and\r\nsay farewell; the break-up of the household at Windygates on the next\r\nday, and the journey south, being sufficient apologies for setting the\r\nexample of retreat. In an hour more the only visitors left were the\r\nguests staying at Swanhaven Lodge.\r\n\r\nThe company gone, the hired waiters from Kirkandrew were paid and\r\ndismissed.\r\n\r\nOn the journey back the silence of Bishopriggs created some surprise\r\namong his comrades.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got my ain concerns to think of,\xe2\x80\x9d was the only answer he\r\nvouchsafed to the remonstrances addressed to him. The \xe2\x80\x9cconcerns\xe2\x80\x9d alluded\r\nto, comprehended, among other changes of plan, his departure from\r\nKirkandrew the next day--with a reference, in case of inquiries, to his\r\nconvenient friend at the Cowgate, Edinburgh. His actual destination--to\r\nbe kept a secret from every body--was Perth. The neighborhood of this\r\ntown--as stated on the authority of her own maid--was the part of\r\nScotland to which the rich widow contemplated removing when she left\r\nSwanhaven in two days\xe2\x80\x99 time. At Perth, Bishopriggs knew of more than\r\none place in which he could get temporary employment--and at Perth he\r\ndetermined to make his first anonymous advances to Mrs. Glenarm.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the evening passed quietly enough at the Lodge.\r\n\r\nThe guests were sleepy and dull after the excitement of the day. Mrs.\r\nGlenarm retired early. At eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock Julius Delamayn was the only\r\nperson left up in the house. He was understood to be in his study,\r\npreparing an address to the electors, based on instructions sent from\r\nLondon by his father. He was actually occupied in the music-room--now\r\nthat there was nobody to discover him--playing exercises softly on his\r\nbeloved violin.\r\n\r\nAt the trainer\xe2\x80\x99s cottage a trifling incident occured, that night, which\r\nafforded materials for a note in Perry\xe2\x80\x99s professional diary.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey had sustained the later trial of walking for a given time and\r\ndistance, at his full speed, without showing any of those symptoms of\r\nexhaustion which had followed the more serious experiment of running,\r\nto which he had been subjected earlier in the day. Perry, honestly\r\nbent--though he had privately hedged his own bets--on doing his best\r\nto bring his man in good order to the post on the day of the race, had\r\nforbidden Geoffrey to pay his evening visit to the house, and had sent\r\nhim to bed earlier than usual. The trainer was alone, looking over\r\nhis own written rules, and considering what modifications he should\r\nintroduce into the diet and exercises of the next day, when he was\r\nstartled by a sound of groaning from the bedroom in which his patron lay\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nHe went in, and found Geoffrey rolling to and fro on the pillow, with\r\nhis face contorted, with his hands clenched, and with the perspiration\r\nstanding thick on his forehead--suffering evidently under the nervous\r\noppression produced by the phantom-terrors of a dream.\r\n\r\nPerry spoke to him, and pulled him up in the bed. He woke with a scream.\r\nHe stared at his trainer in vacant terror, and spoke to his trainer in\r\nwild words. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are your horrid eyes looking at over my shoulder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he cried out. \xe2\x80\x9cGo to the devil--and take your infernal slate with you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Perry spoke to him once more. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been dreaming of somebody, Mr.\r\nDelamayn. What\xe2\x80\x99s to do about a slate?\xe2\x80\x9d Geoffrey looked eagerly round the\r\nroom, and heaved a heavy breath of relief. \xe2\x80\x9cI could have sworn she was\r\nstaring at me over the dwarf pear-trees,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I know\r\nwhere I am now.\xe2\x80\x9d Perry (attributing the dream to nothing more important\r\nthan a passing indigestion) administered some brandy and water, and left\r\nhim to drop off again to sleep. He fretfully forbade the extinguishing\r\nof the light. \xe2\x80\x9cAfraid of the dark?\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry, with a laugh. No. He was\r\nafraid of dreaming again of the dumb cook at Windygates House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVENTH SCENE.--HAM FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRTY-FOURTH.\r\n\r\nTHE NIGHT BEFORE.\r\n\r\nTHE time was the night before the marriage. The place was Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse in Kent.\r\n\r\nThe lawyers had kept their word. The settlements had been forwarded, and\r\nhad been signed two days since.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the surgeon and one of the three young gentlemen\r\nfrom the University, who had engagements elsewhere, the visitors at\r\nWindygates had emigrated southward to be present at the marriage.\r\nBesides these gentlemen, there were some ladies among the guests invited\r\nby Sir Patrick--all of them family connections, and three of them\r\nappointed to the position of Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s bridesmaids. Add one or two\r\nneighbors to be invited to the breakfast--and the wedding-party would be\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing architecturally remarkable about Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse. Ham Farm possessed neither the splendor of Windygates nor the\r\npicturesque antiquarian attraction of Swanhaven. It was a perfectly\r\ncommonplace English country seat, surrounded by perfectly commonplace\r\nEnglish scenery. Snug monotony welcomed you when you went in, and snug\r\nmonotony met you again when you turned to the window and looked out.\r\n\r\nThe animation and variety wanting at Ham Farm were far from being\r\nsupplied by the company in the house. It was remembered, at an\r\nafter-period, that a duller wedding-party had never been assembled\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick, having no early associations with the place, openly\r\nadmitted that his residence in Kent preyed on his spirits, and that he\r\nwould have infinitely preferred a room at the inn in the village. The\r\neffort to sustain his customary vivacity was not encouraged by persons\r\nand circumstances about him. Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s fidelity to the memory of the\r\nlate Sir Thomas, on the scene of his last illness and death, persisted\r\nin asserting itself, under an ostentation of concealment which tried\r\neven the trained temper of Sir Patrick himself. Blanche, still depressed\r\nby her private anxieties about Anne, was in no condition of mind to\r\nlook gayly at the last memorable days of her maiden life. Arnold,\r\nsacrificed--by express stipulation on the part of Lady Lundie--to the\r\nprurient delicacy which forbids the bridegroom, before marriage, to\r\nsleep in the same house with the bride, found himself ruthlessly shut\r\nout from Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s hospitality, and exiled every night to a bedroom\r\nat the inn. He accepted his solitary doom with a resignation which\r\nextended its sobering influence to his customary flow of spirits. As for\r\nthe ladies, the elder among them existed in a state of chronic protest\r\nagainst Lady Lundie, and the younger were absorbed in the essentially\r\nserious occupation of considering and comparing their wedding-dresses.\r\nThe two young gentlemen from the University performed prodigies of\r\nyawning, in the intervals of prodigies of billiard playing. Smith said,\r\nin despair, \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no making things pleasant in this house, Jones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n And Jones sighed, and mildly agreed with him.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday evening--which was the evening before the marriage--the\r\ndullness, as a matter of course, reached its climax.\r\n\r\nBut two of the occupations in which people may indulge on week days are\r\nregarded as harmless on Sunday by the obstinately anti-Christian tone of\r\nfeeling which prevails in this matter among the Anglo-Saxon race. It is\r\nnot sinful to wrangle in religious controversy; and it is not sinful\r\nto slumber over a religious book. The ladies at Ham Farm practiced the\r\npious observance of the evening on this plan. The seniors of the sex\r\nwrangled in Sunday controversy; and the juniors of the sex slumbered\r\nover Sunday books. As for the men, it is unnecessary to say that the\r\nyoung ones smoked when they were not yawning, and yawned when they were\r\nnot smoking. Sir Patrick staid in the library, sorting old letters and\r\nexamining old accounts. Every person in the house felt the oppression of\r\nthe senseless social prohibitions which they had imposed on themselves.\r\nAnd yet every person in the house would have been scandalized if the\r\nplain question had been put: You know this is a tyranny of your own\r\nmaking, you know you don\xe2\x80\x99t really believe in it, you know you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreally like it--why do you submit? The freest people on the civilized\r\nearth are the only people on the civilized earth who dare not face that\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe evening dragged its slow length on; the welcome time drew nearer and\r\nnearer for oblivion in bed. Arnold was silently contemplating, for the\r\nlast time, his customary prospects of banishment to the inn, when he\r\nbecame aware that Sir Patrick was making signs to him. He rose and\r\nfollowed his host into the empty dining-room. Sir Patrick carefully\r\nclosed the door. What did it mean?\r\n\r\nIt meant--so far as Arnold was concerned--that a private conversation\r\nwas about to diversify the monotony of the long Sunday evening at Ham\r\nFarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a word to say to you, Arnold,\xe2\x80\x9d the old gentleman began, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore\r\nyou become a married man. Do you remember the conversation at dinner\r\nyesterday, about the dancing-party at Swanhaven Lodge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember what Lady Lundie said while the topic was on the\r\ntable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe told me, what I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe, that Geoffrey Delamayn was going to\r\nbe married to Mrs. Glenarm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly! I observed that you appeared to be startled by what my\r\nsister-in-law had said; and when you declared that appearances must\r\ncertainly have misled her, you looked and spoke (to my mind) like a man\r\nanimated by a strong feeling of indignation. Was I wrong in drawing that\r\nconclusion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir Patrick. You were right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any objection to tell me why you felt indignant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are probably at a loss to know what interest _I_ can feel in the\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold admitted it with his customary frankness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cI had better go on at once with\r\nthe matter in hand--leaving you to see for yourself the connection\r\nbetween what I am about to say, and the question that I have just put.\r\nWhen I have done, you shall then reply to me or not, exactly as you\r\nthink right. My dear boy, the subject on which I want to speak to you\r\nis--Miss Silvester.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold started. Sir Patrick looked at him with a moment\xe2\x80\x99s attention, and\r\nwent on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy niece has her faults of temper and her failings of judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she has one atoning quality (among many others) which ought\r\nto make--and which I believe will make--the happiness of your married\r\nlife. In the popular phrase, Blanche is as true as steel. Once her\r\nfriend, always her friend. Do you see what I am coming to? She has\r\nsaid nothing about it, Arnold; but she has not yielded one inch in\r\nher resolution to reunite herself to Miss Silvester. One of the first\r\nquestions you will have to determine, after to-morrow, will be the\r\nquestion of whether you do, or not, sanction your wife in attempting to\r\ncommunicate with her lost friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold answered without the slightest reserve\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am heartily sorry for Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s lost friend, Sir Patrick. My\r\nwife will have my full approval if she tries to bring Miss Silvester\r\nback--and my best help too, if I can give it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose words were earnestly spoken. It was plain that they came from his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you are wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cI, too, am sorry for Miss\r\nSilvester. But I am convinced that she has not left Blanche without a\r\nserious reason for it. And I believe you will be encouraging your wife\r\nin a hopeless effort, if you encourage her to persist in the search for\r\nher lost friend. However, it is your affair, and not mine. Do you wish\r\nme to offer you any facilities for tracing Miss Silvester which I may\r\nhappen to possess?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you _can_ help us over any obstacles at starting, Sir Patrick, it\r\nwill be a kindness to Blanche, and a kindness to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. I suppose you remember what I said to you, one morning, when\r\nwe were talking of Miss Silvester at Windygates?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said you had determined to let her go her own way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right! On the evening of the day when I said that I received\r\ninformation that Miss Silvester had been traced to Glasgow. You won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrequire me to explain why I never mentioned this to you or to\r\nBlanche. In mentioning it now, I communicate to you the only positive\r\ninformation, on the subject of the missing woman, which I possess. There\r\nare two other chances of finding her (of a more speculative kind) which\r\ncan only be tested by inducing two men (both equally difficult to deal\r\nwith) to confess what they know. One of those two men is--a person named\r\nBishopriggs, formerly waiter at the Craig Fernie inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold started, and changed color. Sir Patrick (silently noticing him)\r\nstated the circumstances relating to Anne\xe2\x80\x99s lost letter, and to the\r\nconclusion in his own mind which pointed to Bishopriggs as the person in\r\npossession of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to add,\xe2\x80\x9d he proceeded, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Blanche, unfortunately, found an\r\nopportunity of speaking to Bishopriggs at Swanhaven. When she and Lady\r\nLundie joined us at Edinburgh she showed me privately a card which had\r\nbeen given to her by Bishopriggs. He had described it as the address at\r\nwhich he might be heard of--and Blanche entreated me, before we started\r\nfor London, to put the reference to the test. I told her that she had\r\ncommitted a serious mistake in attempting to deal with Bishopriggs on\r\nher own responsibility; and I warned her of the result in which I was\r\nfirmly persuaded the inquiry would end. She declined to believe that\r\nBishopriggs had deceived her. I saw that she would take the matter\r\ninto her own hands again unless I interfered; and I went to the place.\r\nExactly as I had anticipated, the person to whom the card referred me\r\nhad not heard of Bishopriggs for years, and knew nothing whatever about\r\nhis present movements. Blanche had simply put him on his guard, and\r\nshown him the propriety of keeping out of the way. If you should ever\r\nmeet with him in the future--say nothing to your wife, and communicate\r\nwith me. I decline to assist you in searching for Miss Silvester; but I\r\nhave no objection to assist in recovering a stolen letter from a thief.\r\nSo much for Bishopriggs.--Now as to the other man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour friend, Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold sprang to his feet in ungovernable surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI appear to astonish you,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\nArnold sat down again, and waited, in speechless suspense, to hear what\r\nwas coming next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have reason to know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Mr. Delamayn is\r\nthoroughly well acquainted with the nature of Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s present\r\ntroubles. What his actual connection is with them, and how he came into\r\npossession of his information, I have not found out. My discovery begins\r\nand ends with the simple fact that he has the information.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask one question, Sir Patrick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you find out about Geoffrey Delamayn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would occupy a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cto tell you\r\nhow--and it is not at all necessary to our purpose that you should know.\r\nMy present obligation merely binds me to tell you--in strict confidence,\r\nmind!--that Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s secrets are no secrets to Mr. Delamayn. I\r\nleave to your discretion the use you may make of that information. You\r\nare now entirely on a par with me in relation to your knowledge of the\r\ncase of Miss Silvester. Let us return to the question which I asked\r\nyou when we first came into the room. Do you see the connection, now,\r\nbetween that question, and what I have said since?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold was slow to see the connection. His mind was running on Sir\r\nPatrick\xe2\x80\x99s discovery. Little dreaming that he was indebted to Mrs. Inchb\r\nare\xe2\x80\x99s incomplete description of him for his own escape from detection,\r\nhe was wondering how it had happened that _he_ had remained unsuspected,\r\nwhile Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s position had been (in part at least) revealed to view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked you,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Sir Patrick, attempting to help him, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy the\r\nmere report that your friend was likely to marry Mrs. Glenarm roused\r\nyour indignation, and you hesitated at giving an answer. Do you hesitate\r\nstill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to give an answer, Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us put it in another way. I assume that your view of the report\r\ntakes its rise in some knowledge, on your part, of Mr. Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprivate affairs, which the rest of us don\xe2\x80\x99t possess.--Is that conclusion\r\ncorrect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite correct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs what you know about Mr. Delamayn connected with any thing that you\r\nknow about Miss Silvester?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Arnold had felt himself at liberty to answer that question, Sir\r\nPatrick\xe2\x80\x99s suspicions would have been aroused, and Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresolution would have forced a full disclosure from him before he left\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nIt was getting on to midnight. The first hour of the wedding-day was\r\nat hand, as the Truth made its final effort to struggle into light. The\r\ndark Phantoms of Trouble and Terror to come were waiting near them both\r\nat that moment. Arnold hesitated again--hesitated painfully. Sir Patrick\r\npaused for his answer. The clock in the hall struck the quarter to\r\ntwelve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a secret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommitted to your honor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoubly committed to my honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that Geoffrey and I have quarreled since he took me into his\r\nconfidence. I am doubly bound to respect his confidence after that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the cause of your quarrel a secret also?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick looked Arnold steadily in the face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have felt an inveterate distrust of Mr. Delamayn from the first,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnswer me this. Have you any reason to think--since we first\r\ntalked about your friend in the summer-house at Windygates--that my\r\nopinion of him might have been the right one after all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has bitterly disappointed me,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cI can say no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have had very little experience of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Sir\r\nPatrick. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have just acknowledged that you have had reason to\r\ndistrust your experience of your friend. Are you quite sure that you are\r\nacting wisely in keeping his secret from _me?_ Are you quite sure that\r\nyou will not repent the course you are taking to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d He laid a\r\nmarked emphasis on those last words. \xe2\x80\x9cThink, Arnold,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, kindly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink before you answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel bound in honor to keep his secret,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cNo thinking\r\ncan alter that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick rose, and brought the interview to an end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing more to be said.\xe2\x80\x9d With those words he gave Arnold his\r\nhand, and, pressing it cordially, wished him good-night.\r\n\r\nGoing out into the hall, Arnold found Blanche alone, looking at the\r\nbarometer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe glass is at Set Fair, my darling,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night for\r\nthe last time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took her in his arms, and kissed her. At the moment when he released\r\nher Blanche slipped a little note into his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead it,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you are alone at the inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they parted on the eve of their wedding day.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRTY-FIFTH.\r\n\r\nTHE DAY.\r\n\r\nTHE promise of the weather-glass was fulfilled. The sun shone on\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s marriage.\r\n\r\nAt nine in the morning the first of the proceedings of the day began. It\r\nwas essentially of a clandestine nature. The bride and bridegroom\r\nevaded the restraints of lawful authority, and presumed to meet together\r\nprivately, before they were married, in the conservatory at Ham Farm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have read my letter, Arnold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come here to answer it, Blanche. But why not have told me? Why\r\nwrite?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I put off telling you so long; and because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nyou might take it; and for fifty other reasons. Never mind! I\xe2\x80\x99ve made my\r\nconfession. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t a single secret now which is not your secret too.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s time to say No, Arnold, if you think I ought to have no room\r\nin my heart for any body but you. My uncle tells me I am obstinate and\r\nwrong in refusing to give Anne up. If you agree with him, say the word,\r\ndear, before you make me your wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I tell you what I said to Sir Patrick last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout _this?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. The confession (as you call it) which you make in your pretty\r\nnote, is the very thing that Sir Patrick spoke to me about in the\r\ndining-room before I went away. He told me your heart was set on finding\r\nMiss Silvester. And he asked me what I meant to do about it when we were\r\nmarried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you said--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold repeated his answer to Sir Patrick, with fervid embellishments\r\nof the original language, suitable to the emergency. Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s delight\r\nexpressed itself in the form of two unblushing outrages on propriety,\r\ncommitted in close succession. She threw her arms round Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s neck;\r\nand she actually kissed him three hours before the consent of State and\r\nChurch sanctioned her in taking that proceeding. Let us shudder--but let\r\nus not blame her. These are the consequences of free institutions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s my turn to take to pen and ink. I have a\r\nletter to write before we are married as well as you. Only there\xe2\x80\x99s this\r\ndifference between us--I want you to help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you going to write to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo my lawyer in Edinburgh. There will be no time unless I do it now. We\r\nstart for Switzerland this afternoon--don\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. I want to relieve your mind, my darling before we go.\r\nWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you like to know--while we are away--that the right people are\r\non the look-out for Miss Silvester? Sir Patrick has told me of the last\r\nplace that she has been traced to--and my lawyer will set the right\r\npeople at work. Come and help me to put it in the proper language, and\r\nthe whole thing will be in train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Arnold! can I ever love you enough to reward you for this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see, Blanche--in Switzerland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey audaciously penetrated, arm in arm, into Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nstudy--entirely at their disposal, as they well knew, at that hour\r\nof the morning. With Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s pens and Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s paper\r\nthey produced a letter of instructions, deliberately reopening the\r\ninvestigation which Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s superior wisdom had closed. Neither\r\npains nor money were to be spared by the lawyer in at once taking\r\nmeasures (beginning at Glasgow) to find Anne. The report of the result\r\nwas to be addressed to Arnold, under cover to Sir Patrick at Ham Farm.\r\nBy the time the letter was completed the morning had advanced to\r\nten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Blanche left Arnold to array herself in her bridal\r\nsplendor--after another outrage on propriety, and more consequences of\r\nfree institutions.\r\n\r\nThe next proceedings were of a public and avowable nature, and strictly\r\nfollowed the customary precedents on such occasions.\r\n\r\nVillage nymphs strewed flowers on the path to the church door (and sent\r\nin the bill the same day). Village swains rang the joy-bells (and got\r\ndrunk on their money the same evening). There was the proper and awful\r\npause while the bridegroom was kept waiting at the church. There was the\r\nproper and pitiless staring of all the female spectators when the bride\r\nwas led to the altar. There was the clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s preliminary look at\r\nthe license--which meant official caution. And there was the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npreliminary look at the bridegroom--which meant official fees. All the\r\nwomen appeared to be in their natural element; and all the men appeared\r\nto be out of it.\r\n\r\nThen the service began--rightly-considered, the most terrible, surely,\r\nof all mortal ceremonies--the service which binds two human beings, who\r\nknow next to nothing of each other\xe2\x80\x99s natures, to risk the tremendous\r\nexperiment of living together till death parts them--the service\r\nwhich says, in effect if not in words, Take your leap in the dark: we\r\nsanctify, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t insure, it!\r\n\r\nThe ceremony went on, without the slightest obstacle to mar its effect.\r\nThere were no unforeseen interruptions. There were no ominous mistakes.\r\n\r\nThe last words were spoken, and the book was closed. They signed their\r\nnames on the register; the husband was congratulated; the wife was\r\nembraced. They went back aga in to the house, with more flowers strewn\r\nat their feet. The wedding-breakfast was hurried; the wedding-speeches\r\nwere curtailed: there was no time to be wasted, if the young couple were\r\nto catch the tidal train.\r\n\r\nIn an hour more the carriage had whirled them away to the station,\r\nand the guests had given them the farewell cheer from the steps of the\r\nhouse. Young, happy, fondly attached to each other, raised securely\r\nabove all the sordid cares of life, what a golden future was theirs!\r\nMarried with the sanction of the Family and the blessing of the\r\nChurch--who could suppose that the time was coming, nevertheless, when\r\nthe blighting question would fall on them, in the spring-time of their\r\nlove: Are you Man and Wife?\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRTY-SIXTH.\r\n\r\nTHE TRUTH AT LAST.\r\n\r\nTwo days after the marriage--on Wednesday, the ninth of September\r\na packet of letters, received at Windygates, was forwarded by Lady\r\nLundie\xe2\x80\x99s steward to Ham Farm.\r\n\r\nWith one exception, the letters were all addressed either to Sir Patrick\r\nor to his sister-in-law. The one exception was directed to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArnold Brinkworth, Esq., care of Lady Lundie, Windygates House,\r\nPerthshire\xe2\x80\x9d--and the envelope was specially protected by a seal.\r\n\r\nNoticing that the post-mark was \xe2\x80\x9cGlasgow,\xe2\x80\x9d Sir Patrick (to whom the\r\nletter had been delivered) looked with a certain distrust at the\r\nhandwriting on the address. It was not known to him--but it was\r\nobviously the handwriting of a woman. Lady Lundie was sitting opposite\r\nto him at the table. He said, carelessly, \xe2\x80\x9cA letter for Arnold\xe2\x80\x9d--and\r\npushed it across to her. Her ladyship took up the letter, and dropped\r\nit, the instant she looked at the handwriting, as if it had burned her\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Person again!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Lady Lundie. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Person, presuming to\r\naddress Arnold Brinkworth, at My house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Silvester?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said her ladyship, shutting her teeth with a snap. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Person may\r\ninsult me by addressing a letter to my care. But the Person\xe2\x80\x99s name shall\r\nnot pollute my lips. Not even in your house, Sir Patrick. Not even to\r\nplease _you._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick was sufficiently answered. After all that had\r\nhappened--after her farewell letter to Blanche--here was Miss Silvester\r\nwriting to Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s husband, of her own accord! It was unaccountable,\r\nto say the least of it. He took the letter back, and looked at it again.\r\nLady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s steward was a methodical man. He had indorsed each\r\nletter received at Windygates with the date of its delivery. The\r\nletter addressed to Arnold had been delivered on Monday, the seventh of\r\nSeptember--on Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s wedding day.\r\n\r\nWhat did it mean?\r\n\r\nIt was pure waste of time to inquire. Sir Patrick rose to lock the\r\nletter up in one of the drawers of the writing-table behind him. Lady\r\nLundie interfered (in the interest of morality).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you consider it your duty to open that letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear lady! what can you possibly be thinking of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe most virtuous of living women had her answer ready on the spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Lundie, \xe2\x80\x9cof Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s moral welfare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick smiled. On the long list of those respectable disguises\r\nunder which we assert our own importance, or gratify our own love of\r\nmeddling in our neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s affairs, a moral regard for the welfare of\r\nothers figures in the foremost place, and stands deservedly as number\r\none.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall probably hear from Arnold in a day or two,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick,\r\nlocking the letter up in the drawer. \xe2\x80\x9cHe shall have it as soon as I know\r\nwhere to send it to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next morning brought news of the bride and bridegroom.\r\n\r\nThey reported themselves to be too supremely happy to care where they\r\nlived, so long as they lived together. Every question but the question\r\nof Love was left in the competent hands of their courier. This sensible\r\nand trust-worthy man had decided that Paris was not to be thought of as\r\na place of residence by any sane human being in the month of September.\r\nHe had arranged that they were to leave for Baden--on their way to\r\nSwitzerland--on the tenth. Letters were accordingly to be addressed to\r\nthat place, until further notice. If the courier liked Baden, they would\r\nprobably stay there for some time. If the courier took a fancy for the\r\nmountains, they would in that case go on to Switzerland. In the mean\r\nwhile nothing mattered to Arnold but Blanche--and nothing mattered to\r\nBlanche but Arnold.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick re-directed Anne Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s letter to Arnold, at the\r\nPoste Restante, Baden. A second letter, which had arrived that morning\r\n(addressed to Arnold in a legal handwriting, and bearing the post-mark\r\nof Edinburgh), was forwarded in the same way, and at the same time.\r\n\r\nTwo days later Ham Farm was deserted by the guests. Lady Lundie had\r\ngone back to Windygates. The rest had separated in their different\r\ndirections. Sir Patrick, who also contemplated returning to Scotland,\r\nremained behind for a week--a solitary prisoner in his own country\r\nhouse. Accumulated arrears of business, with which it was impossible for\r\nhis steward to deal single-handed, obliged him to remain at his estates\r\nin Kent for that time. To a man without a taste for partridge-shooting\r\nthe ordeal was a trying one. Sir Patrick got through the day with the\r\nhelp of his business and his books. In the evening the rector of a\r\nneighboring parish drove over to dinner, and engaged his host at the\r\nnoble but obsolete game of Piquet. They arranged to meet at each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouses on alternate days. The rector was an admirable player; and Sir\r\nPatrick, though a born Presbyterian, blessed the Church of England from\r\nthe bottom of his heart.\r\n\r\nThree more days passed. Business at Ham Farm began to draw to an end.\r\nThe time for Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s journey to Scotland came nearer. The two\r\npartners at Piquet agreed to meet for a final game, on the next night,\r\nat the rector\xe2\x80\x99s house. But (let us take comfort in remembering it)\r\nour superiors in Church and State are as completely at the mercy of\r\ncircumstances as the humblest and the poorest of us. That last game of\r\nPiquet between the baronet and the parson was never to be played.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the fourth day Sir Patrick came in from a drive, and\r\nfound a letter from Arnold waiting for him, which had been delivered by\r\nthe second post.\r\n\r\nJudged by externals only, it was a letter of an unusually\r\nperplexing--possibly also of an unusually interesting--kind. Arnold was\r\none of the last persons in the world whom any of his friends would have\r\nsuspected of being a lengthy correspondent. Here, nevertheless, was\r\na letter from him, of three times the customary bulk and weight--and,\r\napparently, of more than common importance, in the matter of news,\r\nbesides. At the top the envelope was marked \xe2\x80\x9c_Immediate._.\xe2\x80\x9d And at one\r\nside (also underlined) was the ominous word, \xe2\x80\x9c_Private._.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing wrong, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d thought Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\nHe opened the envelope.\r\n\r\nTwo inclosures fell out on the table. He looked at them for a moment.\r\nThey were the two letters which he had forwarded to Baden. The third\r\nletter remaining in his hand and occupying a double sheet, was from\r\nArnold himself. Sir Patrick read Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s letter first. It was dated\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBaden,\xe2\x80\x9d and it began as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Dear Sir Patrick,--Don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed, if you can possibly help it. I\r\nam in a terrible mess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick looked up for a moment from the letter. Given a young man\r\nwho dates from \xe2\x80\x9cBaden,\xe2\x80\x9d and declares himself to be in \xe2\x80\x9ca terrible\r\nmess,\xe2\x80\x9d as representing the circumstances of the case--what is the\r\ninterpretation to be placed on them? Sir Patrick drew the inevitable\r\nconclusion. Arnold had been gambling.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, and went on with the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must say, dreadful as it is, that I am not to blame--nor she either,\r\npoor thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick paused again. \xe2\x80\x9cShe?\xe2\x80\x9d Blanche had apparently been gambling\r\ntoo? Nothing was wanting to complete the picture but an announcement in\r\nthe next sentence, presenting the courier as carried away, in his turn,\r\nby the insatiate passion for play. Sir Patrick resumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can not, I am sure, expect _me_ to have known the law. And as for\r\npoor Miss Silvester--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Silvester?\xe2\x80\x9d What had Miss Silvester to do with it? And what could\r\nbe the meaning of the reference to \xe2\x80\x9cthe law?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick had re ad the letter, thus far, standing up. A vague\r\ndistrust stole over him at the appearance of Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nin connection with the lines which had preceded it. He felt nothing\r\napproaching to a clear prevision of what was to come. Some indescribable\r\ninfluence was at work in him, which shook his nerves, and made him\r\nfeel the infirmities of his age (as it seemed) on a sudden. It went no\r\nfurther than that. He was obliged to sit down: he was obliged to wait a\r\nmoment before he went on.\r\n\r\nThe letter proceeded, in these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, as for poor Miss Silvester, though she felt, as she reminds me,\r\nsome misgivings--still, she never could have foreseen, being no lawyer\r\neither, how it was to end. I hardly know the best way to break it to\r\nyou. I can\xe2\x80\x99t, and won\xe2\x80\x99t, believe it myself. But even if it should be\r\ntrue, I am quite sure you will find a way out of it for us. I will stick\r\nat nothing, and Miss Silvester (as you will see by her letter) will\r\nstick at nothing either, to set things right. Of course, I have not\r\nsaid one word to my darling Blanche, who is quite happy, and suspects\r\nnothing. All this, dear Sir Patrick, is very badly written, I am afraid,\r\nbut it is meant to prepare you, and to put the best side on matters at\r\nstarting. However, the truth must be told--and shame on the Scotch\r\nlaw is what _I_ say. This it is, in short: Geoffrey Delamayn is even a\r\ngreater scoundrel than you think him; and I bitterly repent (as things\r\nhave turned out) having held my tongue that night when you and I had\r\nour private talk at Ham Farm. You will think I am mixing two things up\r\ntogether. But I am not. Please to keep this about Geoffrey in your mind,\r\nand piece it together with what I have next to say. The worst is still\r\nto come. Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s letter (inclosed) tells me this terrible\r\nthing. You must know that I went to her privately, as Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmessenger, on the day of the lawn-party at Windygates. Well--how it\r\ncould have happened, Heaven only knows--but there is reason to fear that\r\nI married her, without being aware of it myself, in August last, at the\r\nCraig Fernie inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe letter dropped from Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s hand. He sank back in the chair,\r\nstunned for the moment, under the shock that had fallen on him.\r\n\r\nHe rallied, and rose bewildered to his feet. He took a turn in the room.\r\nHe stopped, and summoned his will, and steadied himself by main force.\r\nHe picked up the letter, and read the last sentence again. His face\r\nflushed. He was on the point of yielding himself to a useless out burst\r\nof anger against Arnold, when his better sense checked him at the last\r\nmoment. \xe2\x80\x9cOne fool in the family is, enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9c_My_ business in\r\nthis dreadful emergency is to keep my head clear for Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited once more, to make sure of his own composure--and turned again\r\nto the letter, to see what the writer had to say for himself, in the way\r\nof explanation and excuse.\r\n\r\nArnold had plenty to say--with the drawback of not knowing how to\r\nsay it. It was hard to decide which quality in his letter was most\r\nmarked--the total absence of arrangement, or the total absence of\r\nreserve. Without beginning, middle, or end, he told the story of his\r\nfatal connection with the troubles of Anne Silvester, from the memorable\r\nday when Geoffrey Delamayn sent him to Craig Fernie, to the equally\r\nmemorable night when Sir Patrick had tried vainly to make him open his\r\nlips at Ham Farm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI own I have behaved like a fool,\xe2\x80\x9d the letter concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cin keeping\r\nGeoffrey Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s secret for him--as things have turned out. But how\r\ncould I tell upon him without compromising Miss Silvester? Read her\r\nletter, and you will see what she says, and how generously she releases\r\nme. It\xe2\x80\x99s no use saying I am sorry I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t more cautious. The mischief\r\nis done. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stick at nothing--as I have said before--to undo it. Only\r\ntell me what is the first step I am to take; and, as long as it don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npart me from Blanche, rely on my taking it. Waiting to hear from you, I\r\nremain, dear Sir Patrick, yours in great perplexity, Arnold Brinkworth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick folded the letter, and looked at the two inclosures lying on\r\nthe table. His eye was hard, his brow was frowning, as he put his hand\r\nto take up Anne\xe2\x80\x99s letter. The letter from Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s agent in Edinburgh\r\nlay nearer to him. As it happened, he took that first.\r\n\r\nIt was short enough, and clearly enough written, to invite a reading\r\nbefore he put it down again. The lawyer reported that he had made the\r\nnecessary inquiries at Glasgow, with this result. Anne had been traced\r\nto The Sheep\xe2\x80\x99s Head Hotel. She had lain there utterly helpless, from\r\nillness, until the beginning of September. She had been advertised,\r\nwithout result, in the Glasgow newspapers. On the 5th of September she\r\nhad sufficiently recovered to be able to leave the hotel. She had been\r\nseen at the railway station on the same day--but from that point all\r\ntrace of her had been lost once more. The lawyer had accordingly stopped\r\nthe proceedings, and now waited further instructions from his client.\r\n\r\nThis letter was not without its effect in encouraging Sir Patrick to\r\nsuspend the harsh and hasty judgment of Anne, which any man, placed\r\nin his present situation, must have been inclined to form. Her illness\r\nclaimed its small share of sympathy. Her friendless position--so plainly\r\nand so sadly revealed by the advertising in the newspapers--pleaded\r\nfor merciful construction of faults committed, if faults there were.\r\nGravely, but not angrily, Sir Patrick opened her letter--the letter that\r\ncast a doubt on his niece\xe2\x80\x99s marriage.\r\n\r\nThus Anne Silvester wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGLASGOW, _September_ 5.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR MR. BRINKWORTH,--Nearly three weeks since I attempted to write to\r\nyou from this place. I was seized by sudden illness while I was engaged\r\nover my letter; and from that time to this I have laid helpless in\r\nbed--very near, as they tell me, to death. I was strong enough to be\r\ndressed, and to sit up for a little while yesterday and the day before.\r\nTo-day, I have made a better advance toward recovery. I can hold my pen\r\nand control my thoughts. The first use to which I put this improvement\r\nis to write these lines.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going (so far as I know) to surprise--possibly to alarm--you.\r\nThere is no escaping from it, for you or for me; it must be done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThinking of how best to introduce what I am now obliged to say, I can\r\nfind no better way than this. I must ask you to take your memory back to\r\na day which we have both bitter reason to regret--the day when Geoffrey\r\nDelamayn sent you to see me at the inn at Craig Fernie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may possibly not remember--it unhappily produced no impression\r\non you at the time--that I felt, and expressed, more than once on that\r\noccasion, a very great dislike to your passing me off on the people of\r\nthe inn as your wife. It was necessary to my being permitted to remain\r\nat Craig Fernie that you should do so. I knew this; but still I shrank\r\nfrom it. It was impossible for me to contradict you, without involving\r\nyou in the painful consequences, and running the risk of making a\r\nscandal which might find its way to Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s ears. I knew this also;\r\nbut still my conscience reproached me. It was a vague feeling. I was\r\nquite unaware of the actual danger in which you were placing yourself,\r\nor I would have spoken out, no matter what came of it. I had what is\r\ncalled a presentiment that you were not acting discreetly--nothing\r\nmore. As I love and honor my mother\xe2\x80\x99s memory--as I trust in the mercy of\r\nGod--this is the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou left the inn the next morning, and we have not met since.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few days after you went away my anxieties grew more than I could bear\r\nalone. I went secretly to Windygates, and had an interview with Blanche.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was absent for a few minutes from the room in which we had met.\r\nIn that interval I saw Geoffrey Delamayn for the first time since I\r\nhad left him at Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s lawn-party. He treated me as if I was a\r\nstranger. He told me that he had found out all that had passed between\r\nus at the inn. He said he had taken a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s opinion. Oh, Mr.\r\nBrinkworth! how can I break it to you? how can I write the words which\r\nrepeat what he said to me next? It must be done. Cruel as it is, it\r\nmust be done. He refused to my face to marr y me. He said I was married\r\nalready. He said I was your wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you know why I have referred you to what I felt (and confessed\r\nto feeling) when we were together at Craig Fernie. If you think hard\r\nthoughts, and say hard words of me, I can claim no right to blame you. I\r\nam innocent--and yet it is my fault.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy head swims, and the foolish tears are rising in spite of me. I must\r\nleave off, and rest a little.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been sitting at the window, and watching the people in the\r\nstreet as they go by. They are all strangers. But, somehow, the sight\r\nof them seems to rest my mind. The hum of the great city gives me heart,\r\nand helps me to go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can not trust myself to write of the man who has betrayed us both.\r\nDisgraced and broken as I am, there is something still left in me which\r\nlifts me above _him._ If he came repentant, at this moment, and offered\r\nme all that rank and wealth and worldly consideration can give, I would\r\nrather be what I am now than be his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me speak of you; and (for Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s sake) let me speak of myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought, no doubt, to have waited to see you at Windygates, and to have\r\ntold you at once of what had happened. But I was weak and ill and the\r\nshock of hearing what I heard fell so heavily on me that I fainted.\r\nAfter I came to myself I was so horrified, when I thought of you and\r\nBlanche that a sort of madness possessed me. I had but one idea--the\r\nidea of running away and hiding myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mind got clearer and quieter on the way to this place; and, arrived\r\nhere, I did what I hope and believe was the best thing I could do. I\r\nconsulted two lawyers. They differed in opinion as to whether we were\r\nmarried or not--according to the law which decides on such things in\r\nScotland. The first said Yes. The second said No--but advised me to\r\nwrite immediately and tell you the position in which you stood. I\r\nattempted to write the same day, and fell ill as you know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God, the delay that has happened is of no consequence. I asked\r\nBlanche, at Windygates, when you were to be married--and she told me not\r\nuntil the end of the autumn. It is only the fifth of September now. You\r\nhave plenty of time before you. For all our sakes, make good use of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you to do?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo at once to Sir Patrick Lundie, and show him this letter. Follow\r\nhis advice--no matter how it may affect _me._ I should ill requite your\r\nkindness, I should be false indeed to the love I bear to Blanche, if\r\nI hesitated to brave any exposure that may now be necessary in your\r\ninterests and in hers. You have been all that is generous, all that is\r\ndelicate, all that is kind in this matter. You have kept my disgraceful\r\nsecret--I am quite sure of it--with the fidelity of an honorable man who\r\nhas had a woman\xe2\x80\x99s reputation placed in his charge. I release you, with\r\nmy whole heart, dear Mr. Brinkworth, from your pledge. I entreat you, on\r\nmy knees, to consider yourself free to reveal the truth. I will make any\r\nacknowledgment, on my side, that is needful under the circumstances--no\r\nmatter how public it may be. Release yourself at any price; and then,\r\nand not till then, give back your regard to the miserable woman who has\r\nladen you with the burden of her sorrow, and darkened your life for a\r\nmoment with the shadow of her shame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is any painful sacrifice involved in this. The\r\nquieting of my own mind is involved in it--and that is all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has life left for _me?_ Nothing but the barren necessity of\r\nliving. When I think of the future now, my mind passes over the years\r\nthat may be left to me in this world. Sometimes I dare to hope that the\r\nDivine Mercy of Christ--which once pleaded on earth for a woman like\r\nme--may plead, when death has taken me, for my spirit in Heaven.\r\nSometimes I dare to hope that I may see my mother, and Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s mother,\r\nin the better world. Their hearts were bound together as the hearts of\r\nsisters while they were here; and they left to their children the legacy\r\nof their love. Oh, help me to say, if we meet again, that not in vain\r\nI promised to be a sister to Blanche! The debt I owe to her is the\r\nhereditary debt of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s gratitude. And what am I now? An obstacle\r\nin the way of the happiness of her life. Sacrifice me to that happiness,\r\nfor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake! It is the one thing I have left to live for. Again\r\nand again I say it--I care nothing for myself. I have no right to be\r\nconsidered; I have no wish to be considered. Tell the whole truth about\r\nme, and call me to bear witness to it as publicly as you please!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have waited a little, once more, trying to think, before I close my\r\nletter, what there may be still left to write.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can not think of any thing left but the duty of informing you how you\r\nmay find me if you wish to write--or if it is thought necessary that we\r\nshould meet again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word before I tell you this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible for me to guess what you will do, or what you will be\r\nadvised to do by others, when you get my letter. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know that\r\nyou may not already have heard of what your position is from Geoffrey\r\nDelamayn himself. In this event, or in the event of your thinking it\r\ndesirable to take Blanche into your confidence, I venture to suggest\r\nthat you should appoint some person whom you can trust to see me on\r\nyour behalf--or, if you can not do this that you should see me in the\r\npresence of a third person. The man who has not hesitated to betray us\r\nboth, will not hesitate to misrepresent us in the vilest way, if he can\r\ndo it in the future. For your own sake, let us be careful to give lying\r\ntongues no opportunity of assailing your place in Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s estimation.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t act so as to risk putting yourself in a false position _again!_\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t let it be possible that a feeling unworthy of her should be roused\r\nin the loving and generous nature of your future wife!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis written, I may now tell you how to communicate with me after I\r\nhave left this place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will find on the slip of paper inclosed the name and address of the\r\nsecond of the two lawyers whom I consulted in Glasgow. It is arranged\r\nbetween us that I am to inform him, by letter, of the next place to\r\nwhich I remove, and that he is to communicate the information either to\r\nyou or to Sir Patrick Lundie, on your applying for it personally or by\r\nwriting. I don\xe2\x80\x99t yet know myself where I may find refuge. Nothing is\r\ncertain but that I can not, in my present state of weakness, travel far.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wonder why I move at all until I am stronger, I can only give a\r\nreason which may appear fanciful and overstrained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been informed that I was advertised in the Glasgow newspapers\r\nduring the time when I lay at this hotel, a stranger at the point of\r\ndeath. Trouble has perhaps made me morbidly suspicious. I am afraid of\r\nwhat may happen if I stay here, after my place of residence has been\r\nmade publicly known. So, as soon as I can move, I go away in secret. It\r\nwill be enough for me, if I can find rest and peace in some quiet place,\r\nin the country round Glasgow. You need feel no anxiety about my means\r\nof living. I have money enough for all that I need--and, if I get well\r\nagain, I know how to earn my bread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI send no message to Blanche--I dare not till this is over. Wait till\r\nshe is your happy wife; and then give her a kiss, and say it comes from\r\nAnne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry and forgive me, dear Mr. Brinkworth. I have said all. Yours\r\ngratefully,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cANNE SILVESTER.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Patrick put the letter down with unfeigned respect for the woman who\r\nhad written it.\r\n\r\nSomething of the personal influence which Anne exercised more or less\r\nover all the men with whom she came in contact seemed to communicate\r\nitself to the old lawyer through the medium of her letter. His thoughts\r\nperversely wandered away from the serious and pressing question of his\r\nniece\xe2\x80\x99s position into a region of purely speculative inquiry relating to\r\nAnne. What infatuation (he asked himself) had placed that noble creature\r\nat the mercy of such a man as Geoffrey Delamayn?\r\n\r\nWe have all, at one time or another in our lives, been perplexed as Sir\r\nPatrick was perplexed now.\r\n\r\nIf we know any thing by experience, we know that women cast themselves\r\naway impulsively on unworthy men, and that men ruin themselves headlong\r\nfor unworthy w omen. We have the institution of Divorce actually among\r\nus, existing mainly because the two sexes are perpetually placing\r\nthemselves in these anomalous relations toward each other. And yet,\r\nat every fresh instance which comes before us, we persist in being\r\nastonished to find that the man and the woman have not chosen each other\r\non rational and producible grounds! We expect human passion to act on\r\nlogical principles; and human fallibility--with love for its guide--to\r\nbe above all danger of making a mistake! Ask the wisest among Anne\r\nSilvester\xe2\x80\x99s sex what they saw to rationally justify them in choosing the\r\nmen to whom they have given their hearts and their lives, and you will\r\nbe putting a question to those wise women which they never once\r\nthought of putting to themselves. Nay, more still. Look into your own\r\nexperience, and say frankly, Could you justify your own excellent\r\nchoice at the time when you irrevocably made it? Could you have put your\r\nreasons on paper when you first owned to yourself that you loved him?\r\nAnd would the reasons have borne critical inspection if you had?\r\n\r\nSir Patrick gave it up in despair. The interests of his niece were at\r\nstake. He wisely determined to rouse his mind by occupying himself with\r\nthe practical necessities of the moment. It was essential to send an\r\napology to the rector, in the first place, so as to leave the evening\r\nat his disposal for considering what preliminary course of conduct he\r\nshould advise Arnold to pursue.\r\n\r\nAfter writing a few lines of apology to his partner at Piquet--assigning\r\nfamily business as the excuse for breaking his engagement--Sir Patrick\r\nrang the bell. The faithful Duncan appeared, and saw at once in his\r\nmaster s face that something had happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend a man with this to the Rectory,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t dine\r\nout to-day. I must have a chop at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid, Sir Patrick--if I may be excused for remarking it--you\r\nhave had some bad news?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe worst possible news, Duncan. I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you about it now. Wait\r\nwithin hearing of the bell. In the mean time let nobody interrupt me. If\r\nthe steward himself comes I can\xe2\x80\x99t see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter thinking it over carefully, Sir Patrick decided that there was no\r\nalternative but to send a message to Arnold and Blanche, summoning them\r\nback to England in the first place. The necessity of questioning Arnold,\r\nin the minutest detail, as to every thing that had happened between\r\nAnne Silvester and himself at the Craig Fernie inn, was the first and\r\nforemost necessity of the case.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it appeared to be desirable, for Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s sake, to\r\nkeep her in ignorance, for the present at least, of what had happened.\r\nSir Patrick met this difficulty with characteristic ingenuity and\r\nreadiness of resource.\r\n\r\nHe wrote a telegram to Arnold, expressed in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour letter and inclosures received. Return to Ham Farm as soon as you\r\nconveniently can. Keep the thing still a secret from Blanche. Tell her,\r\nas the reason for coming back, that the lost trace of Anne Silvester\r\nhas been recovered, and that there may be reasons for her returning to\r\nEngland before any thing further can be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan having been dispatched to the station with this message, Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmaster proceeded to calculate the question of time.\r\n\r\nArnold would in all probability receive the telegram at Baden, on the\r\nnext day, September the seventeenth. In three days more he and Blanche\r\nmight be expected to reach Ham Farm. During the interval thus placed\r\nat his disposal Sir Patrick would have ample time in which to recover\r\nhimself, and to see his way to acting for the best in the alarming\r\nemergency that now confronted him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the nineteenth Sir Patrick received a telegram informing him that\r\nhe might expect to see the young couple late in the evening on the\r\ntwentieth.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening the sound of carriage-wheels was audible on the\r\ndrive; and Sir Patrick, opening the door of his room, heard the familiar\r\nvoices in the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Blanche, catching sight of him at the door, \xe2\x80\x9cis Anne\r\nfound?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot just yet, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there news of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I in time to be of use?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn excellent time. You shall hear all about it to-morrow. Go and take\r\noff your traveling-things, and come down again to supper as soon as you\r\ncan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche kissed him, and went on up stairs. She had, as her uncle thought\r\nin the glimpse he had caught of her, been improved by her marriage. It\r\nhad quieted and steadied her. There were graces in her look and manner\r\nwhich Sir Patrick had not noticed before. Arnold, on his side, appeared\r\nto less advantage. He was restless and anxious; his position with Miss\r\nSilvester seemed to be preying on his mind. As soon as his young wife\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nback was turned, he appealed to Sir Patrick in an eager whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly dare ask you what I have got it on my mind to say,\xe2\x80\x9d he began.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must bear it if you are angry with me, Sir Patrick. But--only tell me\r\none thing. Is there a way out of it for us? Have you thought of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can not trust myself to speak of it clearly and composedly to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cBe satisfied if I tell you that I have thought it all\r\nout--and wait for the rest till to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOther persons concerned in the coming drama had had past difficulties\r\nto think out, and future movements to consider, during the interval\r\noccupied by Arnold and Blanche on their return journey to England.\r\nBetween the seventeenth and the twentieth of September Geoffrey Delamayn\r\nhad left Swanhaven, on the way to his new training quarters in the\r\nneighborhood in which the Foot-Race at Fulham was to be run. Between\r\nthe same dates, also, Captain Newenden had taken the opportunity, while\r\npassing through London on his way south, to consult his solicitors. The\r\nobject of the conference was to find means of discovering an anonymous\r\nletter-writer in Scotland, who had presumed to cause serious annoyance\r\nto Mrs. Glenarm.\r\n\r\nThus, by ones and twos, converging from widely distant quarters, they\r\nwere now beginning to draw together, in the near neighborhood of the\r\ngreat city which was soon destined to assemble them all, for the first\r\nand the last time in this world, face to face.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRTY-SEVENTH.\r\n\r\nTHE WAY OUT.\r\n\r\nBREAKFAST was just over. Blanche, seeing a pleasantly-idle morning\r\nbefore her, proposed to Arnold to take a stroll in the grounds.\r\n\r\nThe garden was blight with sunshine, and the bride was bright with\r\ngood-humor. She caught her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s eye, looking at her admiringly, and\r\npaid him a little compliment in return. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have no idea,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chow nice it is to be back at Ham Farm!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am to understand then,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am forgiven for\r\ninterrupting the honey-moon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are more than forgiven for interrupting it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche--\xe2\x80\x9cyou are\r\nthanked. As a married woman,\xe2\x80\x9d she proceeded, with the air of a matron of\r\nat least twenty years\xe2\x80\x99 standing, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking the subject over;\r\nand I have arrived at the conclusion that a honey-moon which takes the\r\nform of a tour on the Continent, is one of our national abuses which\r\nstands in need of reform. When you are in love with each other (consider\r\na marriage without love to be no marriage at all), what do you want with\r\nthe excitement of seeing strange places? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it excitement enough, and\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t it strange enough, to a newly-married woman to see such a total\r\nnovelty as a husband? What is the most interesting object on the face\r\nof creation to a man in Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s position? The Alps? Certainly not! The\r\nmost interesting object is the wife. And the proper time for a bridal\r\ntour is the time--say ten or a dozen years later--when you are beginning\r\n(not to get tired of each other, that\xe2\x80\x99s out of the question) but to\r\nget a little too well used to each other. Then take your tour to\r\nSwitzerland--and you give the Alps a chance. A succession of honey-moon\r\ntrips, in the autumn of married life--there is my proposal for an\r\nimprovement on the present state of things! Come into the garden,\r\nArnold; and let us calculate how long it will be before we get weary of\r\neach other, and want the beauties of nature to keep us company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold looked appealingly to Sir Patrick. Not a word had passed between\r\nthem, as yet, on the serious subject of Anne Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s letter. Sir\r\nPatrick undertook the responsibility of making the necessary excuses to\r\nBlanche.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif I ask leave to interfere with your monopoly\r\nof Arnold for a little while. I have something to say to him about\r\nhis property in Scotland. Will you leave him with me, if I promise to\r\nrelease him as soon as possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche smiled graciously. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have him as long as you like,\r\nuncle. There\xe2\x80\x99s your hat,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, tossing it to her husband, gayly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI brought it in for you when I got my own. You will find me on the\r\nlawn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded, and went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me hear the worst at once, Sir Patrick,\xe2\x80\x9d Arnold began. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it\r\nserious? Do you think I am to blame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will answer your last question first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cDo I think\r\nyou are to blame? Yes--in this way. You committed an act of unpardonable\r\nrashness when you consented to go, as Geoffrey Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s messenger,\r\nto Miss Silvester at the inn. Having once placed yourself in that false\r\nposition, you could hardly have acted, afterward, otherwise than you\r\ndid. You could not be expected to know the Scotch law. And, as an\r\nhonorable man, you were bound to keep a secret confided to you, in which\r\nthe reputation of a woman was concerned. Your first and last error\r\nin this matter, was the fatal error of involving yourself in\r\nresponsibilities which belonged exclusively to another man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man had saved my life.\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Arnold--\xe2\x80\x9cand I believed I was\r\ngiving service for service to my dearest friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to your other question,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cDo I consider your\r\nposition to be a serious one? Most assuredly, I do! So long as we are\r\nnot absolutely certain that Blanche is your lawful wife, the position is\r\nmore than serious: it is unendurable. I maintain the opinion, mind,\r\nout of which (thanks to your honorable silence) that scoundrel Delamayn\r\ncontrived to cheat me. I told him, what I now tell you--that your\r\nsayings and doings at Craig Fernie, do _not_ constitute a marriage,\r\naccording to Scottish law. But,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Sir Patrick, holding up a\r\nwarning forefinger at Arnold, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have read it in Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter, and you may now take it also as a result of my experience, that\r\nno individual opinion, in a matter of this kind, is to be relied on.\r\nOf two lawyers, consulted by Miss Silvester at Glasgow, one draws a\r\ndirectly opposite conclusion to mine, and decides that you and she are\r\nmarried. I believe him to be wrong, but in our situation, we have no\r\nother choice than to boldly encounter the view of the case which he\r\nrepresents. In plain English, we must begin by looking the worst in the\r\nface.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold twisted the traveling hat which Blanche had thrown to him,\r\nnervously, in both hands. \xe2\x80\x9cSupposing the worst comes to the worst,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat will happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not easy to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout entering into the legal\r\naspect of the case. I shall only puzzle you if I do that. Suppose we\r\nlook at the matter in its social bearings--I mean, as it may possibly\r\naffect you and Blanche, and your unborn children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold gave the hat a tighter twist than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cI never thought of the\r\nchildren,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a look of consternation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe children may present themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sir Patrick, dryly, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nall that. Now listen. It may have occurred to your mind that the\r\nplain way out of our present dilemma is for you and Miss Silvester,\r\nrespectively, to affirm what we know to be the truth--namely, that you\r\nnever had the slightest intention of marrying each other. Beware of\r\nfounding any hopes on any such remedy as that! If you reckon on it, you\r\nreckon without Geoffrey Delamayn. He is interested, remember, in proving\r\nyou and Miss Silvester to be man and wife. Circumstances may arise--I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t waste time in guessing at what they may be--which will enable a\r\nthird person to produce the landlady and the waiter at Craig Fernie\r\nin evidence against you--and to assert that your declaration and Miss\r\nSilvester\xe2\x80\x99s declaration are the result of collusion between you two.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t start! Such things have happened before now. Miss Silvester is\r\npoor; and Blanche is rich. You may be made to stand in the awkward\r\nposition of a man who is denying his marriage with a poor woman,\r\nin order to establish his marriage with an heiress: Miss Silvester\r\npresumably aiding the fraud, with two strong interests of her own as\r\ninducements--the interest of asserting the claim to be the wife of a man\r\nof rank, and the interest of earning her reward in money for resigning\r\nyou to Blanche. There is a case which a scoundrel might set up--and with\r\nsome appearance of truth too--in a court of justice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, the law wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow him to do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe law will argue any thing, with any body who will pay the law for\r\nthe use of its brains and its time. Let that view of the matter alone\r\nnow. Delamayn can set the case going, if he likes, without applying to\r\nany lawyer to help him. He has only to cause a report to reach Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nears which publicly asserts that she is not your lawful wife. With her\r\ntemper, do you suppose she would leave us a minute\xe2\x80\x99s peace till the\r\nmatter was cleared up? Or take it the other way. Comfort yourself, if\r\nyou will, with the idea that this affair will trouble nobody in the\r\npresent. How are we to know it may not turn up in the future under\r\ncircumstances which may place the legitimacy of your children in doubt?\r\nWe have a man to deal with who sticks at nothing. We have a state of\r\nthe law which can only be described as one scandalous uncertainty from\r\nbeginning to end. And we have two people (Bishopriggs and Mrs. Inchbare)\r\nwho can, and will, speak to what took place between you and Anne\r\nSilvester at the inn. For Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and for the sake of your\r\nunborn children, we must face this matter on the spot--and settle it at\r\nonce and forever. The question before us now is this. Shall we open the\r\nproceedings by communicating with Miss Silvester or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that important point in the conversation they were interrupted by the\r\nreappearance of Blanche. Had she, by any accident, heard what they had\r\nbeen saying?\r\n\r\nNo; it was the old story of most interruptions. Idleness that considers\r\nnothing, had come to look at Industry that bears every thing. It is\r\na law of nature, apparently, that the people in this world who have\r\nnothing to do can not support the sight of an uninterrupted occupation\r\nin the hands of their neighbors. Blanche produced a new specimen from\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s collection of hats. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking about it in the\r\ngarden,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, quite seriously. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is the brown one with the high\r\ncrown. You look better in this than in the white one with the low crown.\r\nI have come to change them, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d She changed the hats with\r\nArnold, and went on, without the faintest suspicion that she was in the\r\nway. \xe2\x80\x9cWear the brown one when you come out--and come soon, dear. I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstay an instant longer, uncle--I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t interrupt you for the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n She kissed her hand to Sir Patrick, and smiled at her husband, and went\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were we saying?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s awkward to be interrupted in\r\nthis way, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I know any thing of female human nature,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sir Patrick,\r\ncomposedly, \xe2\x80\x9cyour wife will be in and out of the room, in that way, the\r\nwhole morning. I give her ten minutes, Arnold, before she changes her\r\nmind again on the serious and weighty subject of the white hat and the\r\nbrown. These little interruptions--otherwise quite charming--raised\r\na doubt in my mind. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be wise (I ask myself), if we made a\r\nvirtue of necessity, and took Blanche into the conversation? What do you\r\nsay to calling her back and telling her the truth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold started, and changed color.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are difficulties in the way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good fellow! at every step of this business there are difficulties\r\nin the way. Sooner or later, your wife must know what has happened. The\r\ntime for telling her is, no doubt, a matter for your decision, not mine.\r\nAll I say is this. Consider whether the disclosure won\xe2\x80\x99t come from you\r\nwith a better grace, if you make it before you are fairly driven to the\r\nwall, and obliged to open your lips.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold rose to his fee t--took a turn in the room--sat down again--and\r\nlooked at Sir Patrick, with the expression of a thoroughly bewildered\r\nand thoroughly helpless man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt beats me altogether. The truth\r\nis, Sir Patrick, I was fairly forced, at Craig Fernie, into deceiving\r\nBlanche--in what might seem to her a very unfeeling, and a very\r\nunpardonable way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds awkward! What do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try and tell you. You remember when you went to the inn to see\r\nMiss Silvester? Well, being there privately at the time, of course I was\r\nobliged to keep out of your way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see! And, when Blanche came afterward, you were obliged to hide from\r\nBlanche, exactly as you had hidden from me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWorse even than that! A day or two later, Blanche took me into her\r\nconfidence. She spoke to me of her visit to the inn, as if I was a\r\nperfect stranger to the circumstances. She told me to my face, Sir\r\nPatrick, of the invisible man who had kept so strangely out of her\r\nway--without the faintest suspicion that I was the man. And I never\r\nopened my lips to set her right! I was obliged to be silent, or I must\r\nhave betrayed Miss Silvester. What will Blanche think of me, if I tell\r\nher now? That\xe2\x80\x99s the question!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s name had barely passed her husband\xe2\x80\x99s lips before Blanche\r\nherself verified Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s prediction, by reappearing at the open\r\nFrench window, with the superseded white hat in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you done yet!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI am shocked, uncle, to\r\ninterrupt you again--but these horrid hats of Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s are beginning to\r\nweigh upon my mind. On reconsideration, I think the white hat with the\r\nlow crown is the most becoming of the two. Change again, dear. Yes! the\r\nbrown hat is hideous. There\xe2\x80\x99s a beggar at the gate. Before I go quite\r\ndistracted, I shall give him the brown hat, and have done with the\r\ndifficulty in that manner. Am I very much in the way of business? I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nafraid I must appear restless? Indeed, I _am_ restless. I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine\r\nwhat is the matter with me this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick, in his gravest and dryest manner.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are suffering, Blanche, from a malady which is exceedingly\r\ncommon among the young ladies of England. As a disease it is quite\r\nincurable--and the name of it is Nothing-to-Do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche dropped her uncle a smart little courtesy. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might have told\r\nme I was in the way in fewer words than that.\xe2\x80\x9d She whisked round, kicked\r\nthe disgraced brown hat out into the veranda before her, and left the\r\ntwo gentlemen alone once more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour position with your wife, Arnold,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Sir Patrick, returning\r\ngravely to the matter in hand, \xe2\x80\x9cis certainly a difficult one.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\npaused, thinking of the evening when he and Blanche had illustrated\r\nthe vagueness of Mrs. Inchbare\xe2\x80\x99s description of the man at the inn, by\r\nciting Arnold himself as being one of the hundreds of innocent people\r\nwho answered to it! \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cthe situation is even more\r\ndifficult than you suppose. It would have been certainly easier for\r\n_you_--and it would have looked more honorable in _her_ estimation--if\r\nyou had made the inevitable confession before your marriage. I am, in\r\nsome degree, answerable for your not having done this--as well as for\r\nthe far more serious dilemma with Miss Silvester in which you now\r\nstand. If I had not innocently hastened your marriage with Blanche,\r\nMiss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s admirable letter would have reached us in ample time to\r\nprevent mischief. It\xe2\x80\x99s useless to dwell on that now. Cheer up, Arnold!\r\nI am bound to show you the way out of the labyrinth, no matter what the\r\ndifficulties may be--and, please God, I will do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pointed to a table at the other end of the room, on which writing\r\nmaterials were placed. \xe2\x80\x9cI hate moving the moment I have had my\r\nbreakfast,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t go into the library. Bring me the pen and\r\nink here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to write to Miss Silvester?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the question before us which we have not settled yet. Before\r\nI decide, I want to be in possession of the facts--down to the smallest\r\ndetail of what took place between you and Miss Silvester at the inn.\r\nThere is only one way of getting at those facts. I am going to examine\r\nyou as if I had you before me in the witness-box in court.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that preface, and with Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s letter from Baden in his hand as a\r\nbrief to speak from, Sir Patrick put his questions in clear and endless\r\nsuccession; and Arnold patiently and faithfully answered them all.\r\n\r\nThe examination proceeded uninterruptedly until it had reached that\r\npoint in the progress of events at which Anne had crushed Geoffrey\r\nDelamayn\xe2\x80\x99s letter in her hand, and had thrown it from her indignantly to\r\nthe other end of the room. There, for the first time, Sir Patrick\r\ndipped his pen in the ink, apparently intending to take a note. \xe2\x80\x9cBe very\r\ncareful here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know every thing that you can tell me\r\nabout that letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letter is lost,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe letter has been stolen by Bishopriggs,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nis in the possession of Bishopriggs at this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you know more about it than I do!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Arnold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sincerely hope not. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what was inside the letter. Do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Part of it at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPart of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were two letters written, on the same sheet of paper,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nArnold. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of them was written by Geoffrey Delamayn--and that is the\r\none I know about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick started. His face brightened; he made a hasty note. \xe2\x80\x9cGo on,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cHow came the letters to be written on the same sheet?\r\nExplain that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold explained that Geoffrey, in the absence of any thing else to\r\nwrite his excuses on to Anne, had written to her on the fourth or blank\r\npage of a letter which had been addressed to him by Anne herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you read that letter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might have read it if I had liked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you didn\xe2\x80\x99t read it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of delicacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s carefully trained temper was not proof against this.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the most misplaced act of delicacy I ever heard of in my life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n cried the old gentleman, warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind! it\xe2\x80\x99s useless to regret\r\nit now. At any rate, you read Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s answer to Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRepeat it--as nearly as you can remember at this distance of time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was so short,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there is hardly any thing to\r\nrepeat. As well as I remember, Geoffrey said he was called away to\r\nLondon by his father\xe2\x80\x99s illness. He told Miss Silvester to stop where she\r\nwas; and he referred her to me, as messenger. That\xe2\x80\x99s all I recollect of\r\nit now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCudgel your brains, my good fellow! this is very important. Did he make\r\nno allusion to his engagement to marry Miss Silvester at Craig Fernie?\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t he try to pacify her by an apology of some sort?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question roused Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s memory to make another effort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cGeoffrey said something about being true to his\r\nengagement, or keeping his promise or words to that effect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re sure of what you say now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am certain of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick made another note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas the letter signed?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, when he had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd dated?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s memory made a second effort, after he had given his\r\nsecond affirmative answer. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a little,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember\r\nsomething else about the letter. It was not only dated. The time of day\r\nat which it was written was put as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow came he to do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suggested it. The letter was so short I felt ashamed to deliver it\r\nas it stood. I told him to put the time--so as to show her that he was\r\nobliged to write in a hurry. He put the time when the train started; and\r\n(I think) the time when the letter was written as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you delivered that letter to Miss Silvester, with your own hand, as\r\nsoon as you saw her at the inn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick made a third note, and pushed the paper away from him with\r\nan air of supreme satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always suspected that lost letter to be an important document,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid--\xe2\x80\x9cor Bishopriggs would never have stolen it. We must get possession\r\nof it, Arnold, at any sacrifice. The first thing to be done (exactly\r\nas I anticipated), is to write to the Glasgow lawyer, and find Miss\r\nSilvester.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a little!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a voice at the veranda. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget that I\r\nhave come back from Baden to help you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick and Arnold both looked up. This time Blanche had heard the\r\nlast words that had passed between them. She sat down at the table by\r\nSir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s side, and laid her hand caressingly on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite right, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI _am_ suffering this morning\r\nfrom the malady of having nothing to do. Are you going to write to Anne?\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t. Let me write instead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick declined to resign the pen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe person who knows Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s address,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis a lawyer\r\nin Glasgow. I am going to write to the lawyer. When he sends us word\r\nwhere she is--then, Blanche, will be the time to employ your good\r\noffices in winning back your friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drew the writing materials once more with in his reach, and,\r\nsuspending the remainder of Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s examination for the present, began\r\nhis letter to Mr. Crum.\r\n\r\nBlanche pleaded hard for an occupation of some sort. \xe2\x80\x9cCan nobody give\r\nme something to do?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cGlasgow is such a long way off, and\r\nwaiting is such weary work. Don\xe2\x80\x99t sit there staring at me, Arnold! Can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou suggest something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold, for once, displayed an unexpected readiness of resource.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to write,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou owe Lady Lundie a letter. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthree days since you heard from her--and you haven\xe2\x80\x99t answered her yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick paused, and looked up quickly from his writing-desk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Lundie?\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered, inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite true; I owe her a letter. And of course\r\nI ought to tell her we have come back to England. She will be finely\r\nprovoked when she hears why!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe prospect of provoking Lady Lundie seemed to rouse Blanche s dormant\r\nenergies. She took a sheet of her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s note-paper, and began writing\r\nher answer then and there.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick completed his communication to the lawyer--after a look at\r\nBlanche, which expressed any thing rather than approval of her present\r\nemployment. Having placed his completed note in the postbag, he silently\r\nsigned to Arnold to follow him into the garden. They went out together,\r\nleaving Blanche absorbed over her letter to her step-mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs my wife doing any thing wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arnold, who had noticed the\r\nlook which Sir Patrick had cast on Blanche.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour wife is making mischief as fast as her fingers can spread it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold stared. \xe2\x80\x9cShe must answer Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s letter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnquestionably.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she must tell Lady Lundie we have come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what is the objection to her writing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick took a pinch of snuff--and pointed with his ivory cane to\r\nthe bees humming busily about the flower-beds in the sunshine of the\r\nautumn morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the objection,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose Blanche told one of\r\nthose inveterately intrusive insects that the honey in the flowers\r\nhappens, through an unexpected accident, to have come to an end--do\r\nyou think he would take the statement for granted? No. He would plunge\r\nhead-foremost into the nearest flower, and investigate it for himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--there is Blanche in the breakfast-room telling Lady Lundie that\r\nthe bridal tour happens, through an unexpected accident, to have come\r\nto an end. Do you think Lady Lundie is the sort of person to take the\r\nstatement for granted? Nothing of the sort! Lady Lundie, like the\r\nbee, will insist on investigating for herself. How it will end, if she\r\ndiscovers the truth--and what new complications she may not introduce\r\ninto a matter which, Heaven knows, is complicated enough already--I\r\nleave you to imagine. _My_ poor powers of prevision are not equal to\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore Arnold could answer, Blanche joined them from the breakfast-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was an awkward letter to write--and it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ncomfort to have it over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have done it, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Sir Patrick, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it may\r\nbe a comfort. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, Blanche, we shall hear from your step-mother by return of\r\npost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRTY-EIGHTH.\r\n\r\nTHE NEWS FROM GLASGOW.\r\n\r\nTHE letters to Lady Lundie and to Mr. Crum having been dispatched\r\non Monday, the return of the post might be looked for on Wednesday\r\nafternoon at Ham Farm.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick and Arnold held more than one private consultation, during\r\nthe interval, on the delicate and difficult subject of admitting Blanche\r\nto a knowledge of what had happened. The wise elder advised and the\r\ninexperienced junior listened. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick; \xe2\x80\x9cand do\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d And Arnold thought of it--and left it undone.\r\n\r\nLet those who feel inclined to blame him remember that he had only been\r\nmarried a fortnight. It is hard, surely, after but two weeks\xe2\x80\x99 possession\r\nof your wife, to appear before her in the character of an offender on\r\ntrial--and to find that an angel of retribution has been thrown into the\r\nbargain by the liberal destiny which bestowed on you the woman whom you\r\nadore!\r\n\r\nThey were all three at home on the Wednesday afternoon, looking out for\r\nthe postman.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence delivered included (exactly as Sir Patrick had\r\nforeseen) a letter from Lady Lundie. Further investigation, on the\r\nfar more interesting subject of the expected news from Glasgow,\r\nrevealed--nothing. The lawyer had not answered Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry by\r\nreturn of post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that a bad sign?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Blanche.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a sign that something has happened,\xe2\x80\x9d answered her uncle. \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nCrum is possibly expecting to receive some special information, and is\r\nwaiting on the chance of being able to communicate it. We must hope, my\r\ndear, in to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s post.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s letter in the mean time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you\r\nsure it is for you--and not for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about it. Her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s reply was ominously\r\naddressed to her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s brother-in-law. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what that means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Blanche, eying her uncle eagerly while he was reading the letter.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mention Anne\xe2\x80\x99s name you insult my step-mother. I have mentioned\r\nit freely. Lady Lundie is mortally offended with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRash judgment of youth! A lady who takes a dignified attitude, in\r\na family emergency, is never mortally offended--she is only deeply\r\ngrieved. Lady Lundie took a dignified attitude. \xe2\x80\x9cI well know,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote\r\nthis estimable and Christian woman, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have been all along regarded\r\nin the light of an intruder by the family connections of my late beloved\r\nhusband. But I was hardly prepared to find myself entirely shut out\r\nfrom all domestic confidence, at a time when some serious domestic\r\ncatastrophe has but too evidently taken place. I have no desire, dear\r\nSir Patrick, to intrude. Feeling it, however, to be quite inconsistent\r\nwith a due regard for my own position--after what has happened--to\r\ncorrespond with Blanche, I address myself to the head of the family,\r\npurely in the interests of propriety. Permit me to ask whether--under\r\ncircumstances which appear to be serious enough to require the recall of\r\nmy step-daughter and her husband from their wedding tour--you think it\r\nDECENT to keep the widow of the late Sir Thomas Lundie entirely in the\r\ndark? Pray consider this--not at all out of regard for Me!--but out of\r\nregard for your own position with Society. Curiosity is, as you know,\r\nforeign to my nature. But when this dreadful scandal (whatever it may\r\nbe) comes out--which, dear Sir Patrick, it can not fail to do--what will\r\nthe world think, when it asks for Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s, opinion, and hears that\r\nLady Lundie knew nothing about it? Whichever way you may decide I shall\r\ntake no offense. I may possibly be wounded--but that won\xe2\x80\x99t matter. My\r\nlittle round of duties will find me still earnest, still cheerful.\r\nAnd even if you shut me out, my best wishes will find their way,\r\nnevertheless, to Ham Farm. May I add--without encountering a sneer--that\r\nthe prayers of a lonely woman are offered for the welfare of all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick folded up the letter, and put it in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have your step-mother\xe2\x80\x99s best wishes, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d Having answered in\r\nthose terms, he bowed to his niece with his best grace, and walked out\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I think it decent,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated to himself, as he closed the door,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cto leave the widow of the late Sir Thomas Lundie in the dark? When a\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s temper is a little ruffled, I think it more than decent, I think\r\nit absolutely desirable, to let that lady have the last word.\xe2\x80\x9d He went\r\ninto the library, and dropped his sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s remonstrance into a\r\nbox, labeled \xe2\x80\x9cUnanswered Letters.\xe2\x80\x9d Having got rid of it in that way, he\r\nhummed his favorite little Scotch air--and put on his hat, and went out\r\nto sun himself in the garden.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Blanche was not quite satisfied with Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s reply. She\r\nappealed to her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is something wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d she said--\xe2\x80\x9cand my\r\nuncle is hiding it from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold could have desired no better opportunity than she had offered to\r\nhim, in those words, for making the long-deferred disclosure to her of\r\nthe truth. He lifted his eyes to Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s face. By an unhappy fatality\r\nshe was looking charmingly that morning. How would she look if he told\r\nher the story of the hiding at the inn? Arnold was still in love with\r\nher--and Arnold said nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day\xe2\x80\x99s post brought not only the anticipated letter from Mr.\r\nCrum, but an unexpected Glasgow newspaper as well.\r\n\r\nThis time Blanche had no reason to complain that her uncle kept his\r\ncorrespondence a secret from her. After reading the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s letter,\r\nwith an interest and agitation which showed that the contents had taken\r\nhim by surprise, he handed it to Arnold and his niece. \xe2\x80\x9cBad news there,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must share it together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter acknowledging the receipt of Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s letter of inquiry,\r\nMr. Crum began by stating all that he knew of Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmovements--dating from the time when she had left the Sheep\xe2\x80\x99s Head\r\nHotel. About a fortnight since he had received a letter from her\r\ninforming him that she had found a suitable place of residence in a\r\nvillage near Glasgow. Feeling a strong interest in Miss Silvester, Mr.\r\nCrum had visited her some few days afterward. He had satisfied himself\r\nthat she was lodging with respectable people, and was as comfortably\r\nsituated as circumstances would permit. For a week more he had heard\r\nnothing from the lady. At the expiration of that time he had received\r\na letter from her, telling him that she had read something in a Glasgow\r\nnewspaper, of that day\xe2\x80\x99s date, which seriously concerned herself, and\r\nwhich would oblige her to travel northward immediately as fast as her\r\nstrength would permit. At a later period, when she would be more certain\r\nof her own movements, she engaged to write again, and let Mr. Crum know\r\nwhere he might communicate with her if necessary. In the mean time, she\r\ncould only thank him for his kindness, and beg him to take care of any\r\nletters or messages which might be left for her. Since the receipt of\r\nthis communication the lawyer had heard nothing further. He had waited\r\nfor the morning\xe2\x80\x99s post in the hope of being able to report that he had\r\nreceived some further intelligence. The hope had not been realized. He\r\nhad now stated all that he knew himself thus far--and he had forwarded\r\na copy of the newspaper alluded to by Miss Silvester, on the chance\r\nthat an examination of it by Sir Patrick might possibly lead to further\r\ndiscoveries. In conclusion, he pledged himself to write again the moment\r\nhe had any information to send.\r\n\r\nBlanche snatched up the newspaper, and opened it. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me look!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cI can find what Anne saw here if any body can!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ran her eye eagerly over column after column and page after\r\npage--and dropped the newspaper on her lap with a gesture of despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing any where, that I can see, to\r\ninterest Anne. Nothing to interest any body--except Lady Lundie,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwent on, brushing the newspaper off her lap. \xe2\x80\x9cIt turns out to be all\r\ntrue, Arnold, at Swanhaven. Geoffrey Delamayn is going to marry Mrs.\r\nGlenarm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Arnold; the idea instantly flashing on him that this was\r\nthe news which Anne had seen.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick gave him a warning look, and picked up the newspaper from\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may as well run through it, Blanche, and make quite sure that you\r\nhave missed nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe report to which Blanche had referred was among the paragraphs\r\narranged under the heading of \xe2\x80\x9cFashionable News.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cA matrimonial\r\nalliance\xe2\x80\x9d (the Glasgow journal announced) \xe2\x80\x9cwas in prospect between the\r\nHonorable Geoffrey Delamayn and the lovely and accomplished relict of\r\nthe late Mathew Glenarm, Esq., formerly Miss Newenden.\xe2\x80\x9d The marriage\r\nwould, in all probability, \xe2\x80\x9cbe solemnized in Scotland, before the end of\r\nthe present autumn;\xe2\x80\x9d and the wedding breakfast, it was whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cwould\r\ncollect a large and fashionable party at Swanhaven Lodge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick handed the newspaper silently to Arnold. It was plain to any\r\none who knew Anne Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s story that those were the words which had\r\nfound their fatal way to her in her place of rest. The inference that\r\nfollowed seemed to be hardly less clear. But one intelligible object,\r\nin the opinion of Sir Patrick, could be at the end of her journey to\r\nthe north. The deserted woman had rallied the last relics of her old\r\nenergy--and had devoted herself to the desperate purpose of stopping the\r\nmarriage of Mrs. Glenarm.\r\n\r\nBlanche was the first to break the silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems like a fatality,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cPerpetual failure! Perpetual\r\ndisappointment! Are Anne and I doomed never to meet again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at her uncle. Sir Patrick showed none of his customary\r\ncheerfulness in the face of disaster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has promised to write to Mr. Crum,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. Crum has\r\npromised to let us know when he hears from her. That is the only\r\nprospect before us. We must accept it as resignedly as we can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche wandered out listlessly among the flowers in the conservatory.\r\nSir Patrick made no secret of the impression produced upon him by Mr.\r\nCrum\xe2\x80\x99s letter, when he and Arnold were left alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no denying,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat matters have taken a very serious\r\nturn. My plans and calculations are all thrown out. It is impossible to\r\nforesee what new mischief may not come of it, if those two women meet;\r\nor what desperate act Delamayn may not commit, if he finds himself\r\ndriven to the wall. As things are, I own frankly I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to\r\ndo next. A great light of the Presbyterian Church,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with\r\na momentary outbreak of his whimsical humor, \xe2\x80\x9conce declared, in my\r\nhearing, that the invention of printing was nothing more or less than a\r\nproof of the intellectual activity of the Devil. Upon my honor, I feel\r\nfor the first time in my life inclined to agree with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe mechanically took up the Glasgow journal, which Arnold had laid\r\naside, while he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, as a name caught his eye in the first line\r\nof the newspaper at which he happened to look. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Glenarm again! Are\r\nthey turning the iron-master\xe2\x80\x99s widow into a public character?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere the name of the widow was, unquestionably; figuring for the\r\nsecond time in type, in a letter of the gossiping sort, supplied by an\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOccasional Correspondent,\xe2\x80\x9d and distinguished by the title of \xe2\x80\x9cSayings\r\nand Doings in the North.\xe2\x80\x9d After tattling pleasantly of the prospects\r\nof the shooting season, of the fashions from Paris, of an accident to a\r\ntourist, and of a scandal in the Scottish Kirk, the writer proceeded\r\nto the narrative of a case of interest, relating to a marriage in the\r\nsphere known (in the language of footmen) as the sphere of \xe2\x80\x9chigh life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nConsiderable sensation (the correspondent announced) had been caused in\r\nPerth and its neighborhood, by the exposure of an anonymous attempt\r\nat extortion, of which a lady of distinction had lately been made\r\nthe object. As her name had already been publicly mentioned in an\r\napplication to the magistrates, there could be no impropriety in stating\r\nthat the lady in question was Mrs. Glenarm--whose approaching union with\r\nthe Honorable Geoffrey Delamayn was alluded to in another column of the\r\njournal.\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenarm had, it appeared, received an anonymous letter, on the\r\nfirst day of her arrival as guest at the house of a friend, residing\r\nin the neighborhood of Perth. The letter warned her that there was an\r\nobstacle, of which she was herself probably not aware, in the way of\r\nher projected marriage with Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn. That gentleman had\r\nseriously compromised himself with another lady; and the lady would\r\noppose his marriage to Mrs. Glenarm, with proof in writing to produce in\r\nsupport of her claim. The proof was contained in two letters exchanged\r\nbetween the parties, and signed by their names; and the correspondence\r\nwas placed at Mrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s disposal, on two conditions, as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst, that she should offer a sufficiently liberal price to induce the\r\npresent possessor of the letters to part with them. Secondly, that she\r\nshould consent to adopt such a method of paying the money as should\r\nsatisfy the person that he was in no danger of finding himself brought\r\nwithin reach of the law. The answer to these two proposals was\r\ndirected to be made through the medium of an advertisement in the local\r\nnewspaper--distinguished by this address, \xe2\x80\x9cTo a Friend in the Dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCertain turns of expression, and one or two mistakes in spelling,\r\npointed to this insolent letter as being, in all probability, the\r\nproduction of a Scotchman, in the lower ranks of life. Mrs. Glenarm had\r\nat once shown it to her nearest relative, Captain Newenden. The captain\r\nhad sought legal advice in Perth. It had been decided, after due\r\nconsideration, to insert the advertisement demanded, and to\r\ntake measures to entrap the writer of the letter into revealing\r\nhimself--without, it is needless to add, allowing the fellow really to\r\nprofit by his attempted act of extortion.\r\n\r\nThe cunning of the \xe2\x80\x9cFriend in the Dark\xe2\x80\x9d (whoever he might be) had, on\r\ntrying the proposed experiment, proved to be more than a match for the\r\nlawyers. He had successfully eluded not only the snare first set for\r\nhim, but others subsequently laid. A second, and a third, anonymous\r\nletter, one more impudent than the other had been received by Mrs.\r\nGlenarm, assuring that lady and the friends who were acting for her that\r\nthey were only wasting time and raising the price which would be asked\r\nfor the correspondence, by the course they were taking. Captain Newenden\r\nhad thereupon, in default of knowing what other course to pursue,\r\nappealed publicly to the city magistrates, and a reward had been\r\noffered, under the sanction of the municipal authorities, for the\r\ndiscovery of the man. This proceeding also having proved quite\r\nfruitless, it was understood that the captain had arranged, with the\r\nconcurrence of his English solicitors, to place the matter in the hands\r\nof an experienced officer of the London police.\r\n\r\nHere, so far as the newspaper correspondent was aware, the affair rested\r\nfor the present.\r\n\r\nIt was only necessary to add, that Mrs. Glenarm had left the\r\nneighborhood of Perth, in order to escape further annoyance; and had\r\nplaced herself under the protection of friends in another part of the\r\ncounty. Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn, whose fair fame had been assailed (it\r\nwas needless, the correspondent added in parenthesis, to say how\r\ngroundlessly), was understood to have expressed, not only the\r\nindignation natural under the circumstances but also his extreme regret\r\nat not finding himself in a position to aid Captain Newenden\xe2\x80\x99s efforts\r\nto bring the anonymous slanderer to justice. The honorable gentleman\r\nwas, as the sporting public were well aware, then in course of strict\r\ntraining for his forthcoming appearance at the Fulham Foot-Race. So\r\nimportant was it considered that his mind should not be harassed by\r\nannoyances, in his present responsible position, that his trainer and\r\nhis principal backers had thought it desirable to hasten his removal to\r\nthe neighborhood of Fulham--where the exercises which were to prepare\r\nhim for the race were now being continued on the spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mystery seems to thicken,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sir Patrick, briskly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe mystery is\r\nclearing fast--thanks to the Glasgow newspaper. I shall be spared\r\nthe trouble of dealing with Bishopriggs for the stolen letter. Miss\r\nSilvester has gone to Perth, to recover her correspondence with Geoffrey\r\nDelamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she would recognize it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold, pointing to the\r\nnewspaper, \xe2\x80\x9cin the account given of it here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly! And she could hardly fail, in my opinion, to get a step\r\nfarther than that. Unless I am entirely mistaken, the authorship of the\r\nanonymous letters has not mystified _her._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could she guess at that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this way, as I think. Whatever she may have previously thought, she\r\nmust suspect, by this time, that the missing correspondence has been\r\nstolen, and not lost. Now, there are only two persons whom she can think\r\nof, as probably guilty of the theft--Mrs. Inchbare or Bishopriggs. The\r\nnewspaper description of the style of the anonymous letters declares\r\nit to be the style of a Scotchman in the lower ranks of life--in other\r\nwords, points plainly to Bishopriggs. You see that? Very well. Now\r\nsuppose she recovers the stolen property. What is likely to happen then?\r\nShe will be more or less than woman if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make her way next,\r\nprovided with her proofs in writing, to Mrs. Glenarm. She may innocently\r\nhelp, or she may innocently frustrate, the end we have in view--either\r\nway, our course is clear before us again. Our interest in communicating\r\nwith Miss Silvester remains precisely the same interest that it was\r\nbefore we received the Glasgow newspaper. I propose to wait till Sunday,\r\non the chance that Mr. Crum may write again. If we don\xe2\x80\x99t hear from him,\r\nI shall start for Scotland on Monday morning, and take my chance of\r\nfinding my way to Miss Silvester, through Mrs. Glenarm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeaving me behind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeaving you behind. Somebody must stay with Blanche. After having only\r\nbeen a fortnight married, must I remind you of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think Mr. Crum will write before Monday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be such a fortunate circumstance for us, if he does write, that\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t venture to anticipate it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are down on our luck, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI detest slang, Arnold. But slang, I own, expresses my state of mind,\r\nin this instance, with an accuracy which almost reconciles me to the use\r\nof it--for once in a way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery body\xe2\x80\x99s luck turns sooner or later,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp thinking our luck is on the turn at last. Would you mind taking a\r\nbet, Sir Patrick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApply at the stables. I leave betting, as I leave cleaning the horses,\r\nto my groom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that crabbed answer he closed the conversation for the day.\r\n\r\nThe hours passed, and time brought the post again in due course--and the\r\npost decided in Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s favor! Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s want of confidence in the\r\nfavoring patronage of Fortune was practically rebuked by the arrival of\r\na second letter from the Glasgow lawyer on the next day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the pleasure of announcing\xe2\x80\x9d (Mr. Crum wrote) \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have heard\r\nfrom Miss Silvester, by the next postal delivery ensuing, after I had\r\ndispatched my letter to Ham Farm. She writes, very briefly, to inform\r\nme that she has decided on establishing her next place of residence in\r\nLondon. The reason assigned for taking this step--which she certainly\r\ndid not contemplate when I last saw her--is that she finds herself\r\napproaching the end of her pecuniary resources. Having already decided\r\non adopting, as a means of living, the calling of a concert-singer, she\r\nhas arranged to place her interests in the hands of an old friend of\r\nher late mother (who appears to have belonged also to the musical\r\nprofession): a dramatic and musical agent long established in the\r\nmetropolis, and well known to her as a trustworthy and respectable man.\r\nShe sends me the name and address of this person--a copy of which you\r\nwill find on the inclosed slip of paper--in the event of my having\r\noccasion to write to her, before she is settled in London. This is the\r\nwhole substance of her letter. I have only to add, that it does not\r\ncontain the slightest allusion to the nature of the errand on which she\r\nleft Glasgow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Patrick happened to be alone when he opened Mr. Crum\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\r\n\r\nHis first proceeding, after reading it, was to consult the railway\r\ntime-table hanging in the hall. Having done this, he returned to\r\nthe library--wrote a short note of inquiry, addressed to the musical\r\nagent--and rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Silvester is expected in London, Duncan. I want a discreet person\r\nto communicate with her. You are the person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDuncan bowed. Sir Pa trick handed him the note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you start at once you will be in time to catch the train. Go to that\r\naddress, and inquire for Miss Silvester. If she has arrived, give her\r\nmy compliments, and say I will have the honor of calling on her (on\r\nMr. Brinkworth\xe2\x80\x99s behalf) at the earliest date which she may find it\r\nconvenient to appoint. Be quick about it--and you will have time to get\r\nback before the last train. Have Mr. and Mrs. Brinkworth returned from\r\ntheir drive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPending the return of Arnold and Blanche, Sir Patrick looked at Mr.\r\nCrum\xe2\x80\x99s letter for the second time.\r\n\r\nHe was not quite satisfied that the pecuniary motive was really\r\nthe motive at the bottom of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s journey south. Remembering that\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s trainers had removed him to the neighborhood of London, he\r\nwas inclined to doubt whether some serious quarrel had not taken\r\nplace between Anne and Mrs. Glenarm--and whether some direct appeal to\r\nGeoffrey himself might not be in contemplation as the result. In that\r\nevent, Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s advice and assistance would be placed, without\r\nscruple, at Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s disposal. By asserting her claim, in\r\nopposition to the claim of Mrs. Glenarm, she was also asserting herself\r\nto be an unmarried woman, and was thus serving Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s interests as\r\nwell as her own. \xe2\x80\x9cI owe it to Blanche to help her,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Sir Patrick.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I owe it to myself to bring Geoffrey Delamayn to a day of reckoning\r\nif I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe barking of the dogs in the yard announced the return of the\r\ncarriage. Sir Patrick went out to meet Arnold and Blanche at the gate,\r\nand tell them the news.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPunctual to the time at which he was expected, the discreet Duncan\r\nreappeared with a note from the musical agent.\r\n\r\nMiss Silvester had not yet reached London; but she was expected to\r\narrive not later than Tuesday in the ensuing week. The agent had already\r\nbeen favored with her instructions to pay the strictest attention to any\r\ncommands received from Sir Patrick Lundie. He would take care that\r\nSir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s message should be given to Miss Silvester as soon as she\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nAt last, then, there was news to be relied on! At last there was a\r\nprospect of seeing her! Blanche was radiant with happiness, Arnold was\r\nin high spirits for the first time since his return from Baden.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick tried hard to catch the infection of gayety from his young\r\nfriends; but, to his own surprise, not less than to theirs, the effort\r\nproved fruitless. With the tide of events turning decidedly in his\r\nfavor--relieved of the necessity of taking a doubtful journey to\r\nScotland; assured of obtaining his interview with Anne in a few days\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntime--he was out of spirits all through the evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill down on our luck!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Arnold, as he and his host finished\r\ntheir last game of billiards, and parted for the night. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely, we\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wish for a more promising prospect than _our_ prospect next\r\nweek?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick laid his hand on Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us look indulgently together,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in his whimsically grave\r\nway, \xe2\x80\x9cat the humiliating spectacle of an old man\xe2\x80\x99s folly. I feel, at\r\nthis moment, Arnold, as if I would give every thing that I possess in\r\nthe world to have passed over next week, and to be landed safely in the\r\ntime beyond it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is the folly! I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell why. With every reason to be in\r\nbetter spirits than usual, I am unaccountably, irrationally, invincibly\r\ndepressed. What are we to conclude from that? Am I the object of a\r\nsupernatural warning of misfortune to come? Or am I the object of\r\na temporary derangement of the functions of the liver? There is the\r\nquestion. Who is to decide it? How contemptible is humanity, Arnold,\r\nrightly understood! Give me my candle, and let\xe2\x80\x99s hope it\xe2\x80\x99s the liver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTH SCENE--THE PANTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRTY-NINTH.\r\n\r\nANNE WINS A VICTORY.\r\n\r\nON a certain evening in the month of September (at that period of the\r\nmonth when Arnold and Blanche were traveling back from Baden to Ham\r\nFarm) an ancient man--with one eye filmy and blind, and one eye moist\r\nand merry--sat alone in the pantry of the Harp of Scotland Inn, Perth,\r\npounding the sugar softly in a glass of whisky-punch. He has hitherto\r\nbeen personally distinguished in these pages as the self-appointed\r\nfather of Anne Silvester and the humble servant of Blanche at the dance\r\nat Swanhaven Lodge. He now dawns on the view in amicable relations with\r\na third lady--and assumes the mystic character of Mrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cFriend\r\nin the Dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArriving in Perth the day after the festivities at Swanhaven,\r\nBishopriggs proceeded to the Harp of Scotland--at which establishment\r\nfor the reception of travelers he possessed the advantage of being known\r\nto the landlord as Mrs. Inchbare\xe2\x80\x99s right-hand man, and of standing high\r\non the head-waiter\xe2\x80\x99s list of old and intimate friends.\r\n\r\nInquiring for the waiter first by the name of Thomas (otherwise Tammy)\r\nPennyquick, Bishopriggs found his friend in sore distress of body and\r\nmind. Contending vainly against the disabling advances of rheumatism,\r\nThomas Pennyquick ruefully contemplated the prospect of being laid up\r\nat home by a long illness--with a wife and children to support, and with\r\nthe emoluments attached to his position passing into the pockets of the\r\nfirst stranger who could be found to occupy his place at the inn.\r\n\r\nHearing this doleful story, Bishopriggs cunningly saw his way to serving\r\nhis own private interests by performing the part of Thomas Pennyquick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngenerous and devoted friend.\r\n\r\nHe forthwith offered to fill the place, without taking the emoluments,\r\nof the invalided headwaiter--on the understanding, as a matter of\r\ncourse, that the landlord consented to board and lodge him free of\r\nexpense at the inn. The landlord having readily accepted this condition,\r\nThomas Pennyquick retired to the bosom of his family. And there was\r\nBishopriggs, doubly secured behind a respectable position and a virtuous\r\naction against all likelihood of suspicion falling on him as a stranger\r\nin Perth--in the event of his correspondence with Mrs. Glenarm being\r\nmade the object of legal investigation on the part of her friends!\r\n\r\nHaving opened the campaign in this masterly manner, the same sagacious\r\nforesight had distinguished the operations of Bishopriggs throughout.\r\n\r\nHis correspondence with Mrs. Glenarm was invariably written with the\r\nleft hand--the writing thus produced defying detection, in all cases,\r\nas bearing no resemblance of character whatever to writing produced by\r\npersons who habitually use the other hand. A no less far-sighted cunning\r\ndistinguished his proceedings in answering the advertisements which the\r\nlawyers duly inserted in the newspaper. He appointed hours at which he\r\nwas employed on business-errands for the inn, and places which lay\r\non the way to those errands, for his meetings with Mrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrepresentatives: a pass-word being determined on, as usual in such\r\ncases, by exchanging which the persons concerned could discover each\r\nother. However carefully the lawyers might set the snare--whether they\r\nhad their necessary \xe2\x80\x9cwitness\xe2\x80\x9d disguised as an artist sketching in the\r\nneighborhood, or as an old woman selling fruit, or what not--the wary\r\neye of Bishopriggs detected it. He left the pass-word unspoken; he\r\nwent his way on his errand; he was followed on suspicion; and he was\r\ndiscovered to be only \xe2\x80\x9ca respectable person,\xe2\x80\x9d charged with a message by\r\nthe landlord of the Harp of Scotland Inn!\r\n\r\nTo a man intrenched behind such precautions as these, the chance of\r\nbeing detected might well be reckoned among the last of all the chances\r\nthat could possibly happen.\r\n\r\nDiscovery was, nevertheless, advancing on Bishopriggs from a quarter\r\nwhich had not been included in his calculations. Anne Silvester was in\r\nPerth; forewarned by the newspaper (as Sir Patrick had guessed) that the\r\nletters offered to Mrs. Glenarm were the letters between Geoffrey and\r\nherself, which she had lost at Craig Fernie, and bent on clearing up the\r\nsuspicion which pointed to Bishopriggs as the person who was trying to\r\nturn the correspondence to pecuniary account. The inquiries made for\r\nhim, at Anne\xe2\x80\x99s request, as soon as she arrived in the town, openly\r\ndescribed his name, and his former position as headwaiter at Craig\r\nFernie--and thu s led easily to the discovery of him, in his publicly\r\navowed character of Thomas Pennyquick\xe2\x80\x99s devoted friend. Toward\r\nevening, on the day after she reached Perth, the news came to Anne that\r\nBishopriggs was in service at the inn known as the Harp of Scotland.\r\nThe landlord of the hotel at which she was staying inquired whether he\r\nshould send a message for her. She answered, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I will take my message\r\nmyself. All I want is a person to show me the way to the inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecluded in the solitude of the head-waiter\xe2\x80\x99s pantry, Bishopriggs sat\r\npeacefully melting the sugar in his whisky-punch.\r\n\r\nIt was the hour of the evening at which a period of tranquillity\r\ngenerally occurred before what was called \xe2\x80\x9cthe night-business\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\nhouse began. Bishopriggs was accustomed to drink and meditate daily in\r\nthis interval of repose. He tasted the punch, and smiled contentedly as\r\nhe set down his glass. The prospect before him looked fairly enough. He\r\nhad outwitted the lawyers in the preliminary negotiations thus far. All\r\nthat was needful now was to wait till the terror of a public scandal\r\n(sustained by occasional letters from her \xe2\x80\x9cFriend in the Dark\xe2\x80\x9d) had\r\nits due effect on Mrs. Glenarm, and hurried her into paying the\r\npurchase-money for the correspondence with her own hand. \xe2\x80\x9cLet it breed\r\nin the brain,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cand the siller will soon come out o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\npurse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis reflections were interrupted by the appearance of a slovenly\r\nmaid-servant, with a cotton handkerchief tied round her head, and an\r\nuncleaned sauce-pan in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, Maister Bishopriggs,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the girl, \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s a braw young leddy\r\nspeerin\xe2\x80\x99 for ye by yer ain name at the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA leddy?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Bishopriggs, with a look of virtuous disgust. \xe2\x80\x9cYe\r\ndonnert ne\xe2\x80\x99er-do-weel, do you come to a decent, \xe2\x80\x98sponsible man like me,\r\nwi\xe2\x80\x99 sic a Cyprian overture as that? What d\xe2\x80\x99ye tak\xe2\x80\x99 me for? Mark Antony\r\nthat lost the world for love (the mair fule he!)? or Don Jovanny that\r\ncounted his concubines by hundreds, like the blessed Solomon himself?\r\nAwa\xe2\x80\x99 wi\xe2\x80\x99 ye to yer pots and pans; and bid the wandering Venus that sent\r\nye go spin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore the girl could answer she was gently pulled aside from the\r\ndoorway, and Bishopriggs, thunder-struck, saw Anne Silvester standing in\r\nher place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better tell the servant I am no stranger to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne,\r\nlooking toward the kitchen-maid, who stood in the passage staring at her\r\nin stolid amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy ain sister\xe2\x80\x99s child!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Bishopriggs, lying with his customary\r\nreadiness. \xe2\x80\x9cGo yer ways, Maggie. The bonny lassie\xe2\x80\x99s my ain kith and kin.\r\nThe tongue o\xe2\x80\x99 scandal, I trow, has naething to say against that.--Lord\r\nsave us and guide us!\xe2\x80\x9d he added In another tone, as the girl closed the\r\ndoor on them, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat brings ye here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have something to say to you. I am not very well; I must wait a\r\nlittle first. Give me a chair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBishopriggs obeyed in silence. His one available eye rested on Anne,\r\nas he produced the chair, with an uneasy and suspicious attention. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nwanting to know one thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBy what meeraiculous means, young\r\nmadam, do ye happen to ha\xe2\x80\x99 fund yer way to this inn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne told him how her inquiries had been made and what the result had\r\nbeen, plainly and frankly. The clouded face of Bishopriggs began to\r\nclear again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHech! hech!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, recovering all his native impudence, \xe2\x80\x9cI hae\r\nhad occasion to remark already, to anither leddy than yersel\xe2\x80\x99, that it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nseemply mairvelous hoo a man\xe2\x80\x99s ain gude deeds find him oot in this lower\r\nwarld o\xe2\x80\x99 ours. I hae dune a gude deed by pure Tammy Pennyquick, and\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s a\xe2\x80\x99 Pairth ringing wi the report o\xe2\x80\x99 it; and Sawmuel Bishopriggs\r\nsae weel known that ony stranger has only to ask, and find him.\r\nUnderstand, I beseech ye, that it\xe2\x80\x99s no hand o\xe2\x80\x99 mine that pets this new\r\nfeather in my cap. As a gude Calvinist, my saul\xe2\x80\x99s clear o\xe2\x80\x99 the smallest\r\nfigment o\xe2\x80\x99 belief in Warks. When I look at my ain celeebrity I joost\r\nask, as the Psawmist asked before me, \xe2\x80\x98Why do the heathen rage, and the\r\npeople imagine a vain thing?\xe2\x80\x99 It seems ye\xe2\x80\x99ve something to say to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, suddenly reverting to the object of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s visit. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it humanly\r\npossible that ye can ha\xe2\x80\x99 come a\xe2\x80\x99 the way to Pairth for naething but\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe expression of suspicion began to show itself again in his face.\r\nConcealing as she best might the disgust that he inspired in her, Anne\r\nstated her errand in the most direct manner, and in the fewest possible\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come here to ask you for something,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy? ay? What may it be ye\xe2\x80\x99re wanting of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want the letter I lost at Craig Fernie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven the solidly-founded self-possession of Bishopriggs himself was\r\nshaken by the startling directness of that attack on it. His glib tongue\r\nwas paralyzed for the moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI dinna ken what ye\xe2\x80\x99re drivin\xe2\x80\x99 at,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, after an interval, with a sullen consciousness that he had been\r\nall but tricked into betraying himself.\r\n\r\nThe change in his manner convinced Anne that she had found in\r\nBishopriggs the person of whom she was in search.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have got my letter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, sternly insisting on the truth. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nyou are trying to turn it to a disgraceful use. I won\xe2\x80\x99t allow you to\r\nmake a market of my private affairs. You have offered a letter of mine\r\nfor sale to a stranger. I insist on your restoring it to me before I\r\nleave this room!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBishopriggs hesitated again. His first suspicion that Anne had been\r\nprivately instructed by Mrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers returned to his mind as\r\na suspicion confirmed. He felt the vast importance of making a cautious\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll no\xe2\x80\x99 waste precious time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s consideration\r\nwith himself, \xe2\x80\x9cin brushing awa\xe2\x80\x99 the fawse breath o\xe2\x80\x99 scandal, when it\r\npasses my way. It blaws to nae purpose, my young leddy, when it blaws on\r\nan honest man like me. Fie for shame on ye for saying what ye\xe2\x80\x99ve joost\r\nsaid--to me that was a fether to ye at Craig Fernie! Wha\xe2\x80\x99 set ye on to\r\nit? Will it be man or woman that\xe2\x80\x99s misca\xe2\x80\x99ed me behind my back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne took the Glasgow newspaper from the pocket of her traveling cloak,\r\nand placed it before him, open at the paragraph which described the act\r\nof extortion attempted on Mrs. Glenarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have found there,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9call that I want to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay a\xe2\x80\x99 the tribe o\xe2\x80\x99 editors, preenters, paper-makers, news-vendors,\r\nand the like, bleeze together in the pit o\xe2\x80\x99 Tophet!\xe2\x80\x9d With this devout\r\naspiration--internally felt, not openly uttered--Bishopriggs put on his\r\nspectacles, and read the passage pointed out to him. \xe2\x80\x9cI see naething\r\nhere touching the name o\xe2\x80\x99 Sawmuel Bishopriggs, or the matter o\xe2\x80\x99 ony loss\r\nye may or may not ha\xe2\x80\x99 had at Craig Fernie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when he had done;\r\nstill defending his position, with a resolution worthy of a better\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s pride recoiled at the prospect of prolonging the discussion with\r\nhim. She rose to her feet, and said her last words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have learned enough by this time,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cto know that the\r\none argument that prevails with you is the argument of money. If money\r\nwill spare me the hateful necessity of disputing with you--poor as I\r\nam, money you shall have. Be silent, if you please. You are personally\r\ninterested in what I have to say next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe opened her purse, and took a five-pound note from it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you choose to own the truth, and produce the letter,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will give you this, as your reward for finding, and restoring to me,\r\nsomething that I had lost. If you persist in your present prevarication,\r\nI can, and will, make that sheet of note-paper you have stolen from me\r\nnothing but waste paper in your hands. You have threatened Mrs. Glenarm\r\nwith my interference. Suppose I go to Mrs. Glenarm? Suppose I interfere\r\nbefore the week is out? Suppose I have other letters of Mr. Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin my possession, and produce them to speak for me? What has Mrs.\r\nGlenarm to purchase of you _then?_ Answer me that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe color rose on her pale face. Her eyes, dim and weary when\r\nshe entered the room, looked him brightly through and through in\r\nimmeasurable contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cAnswer me that!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, with a burst\r\nof her old energy which revealed the fire and passion of the woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnature, not quenched even yet!\r\n\r\nIf Bishopriggs had a merit, it was a rare merit, as men go, of\r\nknowing when he was beaten. If he had an accomplishment, it was the\r\naccomplishment of retiring defeated, with all the honors of war.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy presairve us!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, in the most innocent manner. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it\r\neven You Yersel\xe2\x80\x99 that writ the letter to the man ca\xe2\x80\x99ed Jaffray Delamayn,\r\nand got the wee bit answer in pencil on the blank page? Hoo, in Heeven\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname, was I to know _that_ was the letter ye were after when ye cam\xe2\x80\x99 in\r\nhere? Did ye ever tell me ye were Anne Silvester, at the hottle? Never\r\nance! Was the puir feckless husband-creature ye had wi\xe2\x80\x99 ye at the inn,\r\nJaffray Delamayn? Jaffray wad mak\xe2\x80\x99 twa o\xe2\x80\x99 him, as my ain eyes ha\xe2\x80\x99 seen.\r\nGi\xe2\x80\x99 ye back yer letter? My certie! noo I know it is yer letter, I\xe2\x80\x99ll gi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nit back wi\xe2\x80\x99 a\xe2\x80\x99 the pleasure in life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe opened his pocket-book, and took it out, with an alacrity worthy of\r\nthe honestest man in Christendom--and (more wonderful still) he looked\r\nwith a perfectly assumed expression of indifference at the five-pound\r\nnote in Anne\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoot! toot!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no\xe2\x80\x99 that clear in my mind that I\xe2\x80\x99m free to\r\ntak\xe2\x80\x99 yer money. Eh, weel! weel! I\xe2\x80\x99ll een receive it, if ye like, as a\r\nbit Memento o\xe2\x80\x99 the time when I was o\xe2\x80\x99 some sma\xe2\x80\x99 sairvice to ye at the\r\nhottle. Ye\xe2\x80\x99ll no\xe2\x80\x99 mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, suddenly returning to business,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwritin\xe2\x80\x99 me joost a line--in the way o\xe2\x80\x99 receipt, ye ken--to clear me o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nony future suspicion in the matter o\xe2\x80\x99 the letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne threw down the bank-note on the table near which they were\r\nstanding, and snatched the letter from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou need no receipt,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThere shall be no letter to bear\r\nwitness against you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe lifted her other hand to tear it in pieces. Bishopriggs caught her\r\nby both wrists, at the same moment, and held her fast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBide a wee!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYe don\xe2\x80\x99t get the letter, young madam, without\r\nthe receipt. It may be a\xe2\x80\x99 the same to _you,_ now ye\xe2\x80\x99ve married the other\r\nman, whether Jaffray Delamayn ance promised ye fair in the by-gone time,\r\nor no. But, my certie! it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter o\xe2\x80\x99 some moment to _me,_ that ye\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nchairged wi\xe2\x80\x99 stealin\xe2\x80\x99 the letter, and making a market o\xe2\x80\x99t, and Lord\r\nknows what besides, that I suld hae yer ain acknowledgment for it in\r\nblack and white. Gi\xe2\x80\x99 me my bit receipt--and een do as ye will with yer\r\nletter after that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s hold of the letter relaxed. She let Bishopriggs repossess himself\r\nof it as it dropped on the floor between them, without making an effort\r\nto prevent him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be a\xe2\x80\x99 the same to _you,_ now ye\xe2\x80\x99ve married the other man,\r\nwhether Jaffray Delamayn ance promised ye fair in the by-gone time,\r\nor no.\xe2\x80\x9d Those words presented Anne\xe2\x80\x99s position before her in a light in\r\nwhich she had not seen it yet. She had truly expressed the loathing that\r\nGeoffrey now inspired in her, when she had declared, in her letter to\r\nArnold, that, even if he offered her marriage, in atonement for the\r\npast, she would rather be what she was than be his wife. It had never\r\noccurred to her, until this moment, that others would misinterpret the\r\nsensitive pride which had prompted the abandonment of her claim on the\r\nman who had ruined her. It had never been brought home to her until now,\r\nthat if she left him contemptuously to go his own way, and sell himself\r\nto the first woman who had money enough to buy him, her conduct would\r\nsanction the false conclusion that she was powerless to interfere,\r\nbecause she was married already to another man. The color that had risen\r\nin her face vanished, and left it deadly pale again. She began to see\r\nthat the purpose of her journey to the north was not completed yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will give you your receipt,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me what to write, and it\r\nshall be written.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBishopriggs dictated the receipt. She wrote and signed it. He put it in\r\nhis pocket-book with the five-pound note, and handed her the letter in\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTear it if ye will,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt matters naething to _me._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment she hesitated. A sudden shuddering shook her from head to\r\nfoot--the forewarning, it might be, of the influence which that letter,\r\nsaved from destruction by a hair\xe2\x80\x99s-breadth, was destined to exercise on\r\nher life to come. She recovered herself, and folded her cloak closer to\r\nher, as if she had felt a passing chill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI will keep the letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe folded it and put it in the pocket of her dress. Then turned to\r\ngo--and stopped at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing more,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know Mrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s present\r\naddress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe\xe2\x80\x99re no\xe2\x80\x99 reely going to Mistress Glenarm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is no concern of yours. You can answer my question or not, as you\r\nplease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, my leddy! yer temper\xe2\x80\x99s no\xe2\x80\x99 what it used to be in the auld times at\r\nthe hottle. Aweel! aweel! ye ha\xe2\x80\x99 gi\xe2\x80\x99en me yer money, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll een gi\xe2\x80\x99\r\nye back gude measure for it, on my side. Mistress Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s awa\xe2\x80\x99 in\r\nprivate--incog, as they say--to Jaffray Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s brither at Swanhaven\r\nLodge. Ye may rely on the information, and it\xe2\x80\x99s no\xe2\x80\x99 that easy to come\r\nat either. They\xe2\x80\x99ve keepit it a secret as they think from a\xe2\x80\x99 the warld.\r\nHech! hech! Tammy Pennyquick\xe2\x80\x99s youngest but twa is page-boy at the hoose\r\nwhere the leddy\xe2\x80\x99s been veesitin\xe2\x80\x99, on the outskirts o\xe2\x80\x99 Pairth. Keep a\r\nsecret if ye can frae the pawky ears o\xe2\x80\x99 yer domestics in the servants\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhall!--Eh! she\xe2\x80\x99s aff, without a word at parting!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, as Anne\r\nleft him without ceremony in the middle of his dissertation on secrets\r\nand servants\xe2\x80\x99 halls. \xe2\x80\x9cI trow I ha\xe2\x80\x99 gaen out for wool, and come back\r\nshorn,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, reflecting grimly on the disastrous overthrow of the\r\npromising speculation on which he had embarked. \xe2\x80\x9cMy certie! there was\r\nnaething left for\xe2\x80\x99t, when madam\xe2\x80\x99s fingers had grippit me, but to slip\r\nthrough them as cannily as I could. What\xe2\x80\x99s Jaffray\xe2\x80\x99s marrying, or no\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmarrying, to do wi\xe2\x80\x99 _her?_\xe2\x80\x9d he wondered, reverting to the question which\r\nAnne had put to him at parting. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd whar\xe2\x80\x99s the sense o\xe2\x80\x99 her errand, if\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s reely bent on finding her way to Mistress Glenarm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhatever the sense of her errand might be, Anne\xe2\x80\x99s next proceeding proved\r\nthat she was really bent on it. After resting two days, she left Perth\r\nby the first train in the morning, for Swanhaven Lodge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNINTH SCENE.--THE MUSIC-ROOM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FORTIETH.\r\n\r\nJULIUS MAKES MISCHIEF.\r\n\r\nJULIUS DELAMAYN was alone, idly sauntering to and fro, with his violin\r\nin his hand, on the terrace at Swanhaven Lodge.\r\n\r\nThe first mellow light of evening was in the sky. It was the close of\r\nthe day on which Anne Silvester had left Perth.\r\n\r\nSome hours earlier, Julius had sacrificed himself to the duties of his\r\npolitical position--as made for him by his father. He had submitted to\r\nthe dire necessity of delivering an oration to the electors, at a public\r\nmeeting in the neighboring town of Kirkandrew. A detestable atmosphere\r\nto breathe; a disorderly audience to address; insolent opposition to\r\nconciliate; imbecile inquiries to answer; brutish interruptions to\r\nendure; greedy petitioners to pacify; and dirty hands to shake: these\r\nare the stages by which the aspiring English gentleman is compelled\r\nto travel on the journey which leads him from the modest obscurity of\r\nprivate life to the glorious publicity of the House of Commons. Julius\r\npaid the preliminary penalties of a political first appearance, as\r\nexacted by free institutions, with the necessary patience; and returned\r\nto the welcome shelter of home, more indifferent, if possible, to the\r\nattractions of Parliamentary distinction than when he set out. The\r\ndiscord of the roaring \xe2\x80\x9cpeople\xe2\x80\x9d (still echoing in his ears) had\r\nsharpened his customary sensibility to the poetry of sound, as composed\r\nby Mozart, and as interpreted by piano and violin. Possessing himself of\r\nhis beloved instrument, he had gone out on the terrace to cool himself\r\nin the evening air, pending the arrival of the servant whom he had\r\nsummoned by the music-room bell. The man appeared at the glass door\r\nwhich led into the room; and reported, in answer to his master\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninquiry, that Mrs. Julius Delamayn was out paying visits, and was not\r\nexpected to return for another hour at least.\r\n\r\nJulius groaned in spirit. The finest music which Mozart has written for\r\nthe violin associates that instrument with the piano. Without the wife\r\nto help him, the husband was mute. After an instant\xe2\x80\x99s consideration,\r\nJulius hit on an idea which promised, in some degree, to remedy the\r\ndisaster of Mrs. Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s absence from home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas Mrs. Glenarm gone out, too?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy compliments. If Mrs. Glenarm has nothing else to do, will she be so\r\nkind as to come to me in the music-room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant went away with his message. Julius seated himself on one of\r\nthe terrace-benches, and began to tune his violin.\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenarm--rightly reported by Bishopriggs as having privately\r\ntaken refuge from her anonymous correspondent at Swanhaven Lodge--was,\r\nmusically speaking, far from being an efficient substitute for Mrs.\r\nDelamayn. Julius possessed, in his wife, one of the few players on\r\nthe piano-forte under whose subtle touch that shallow and soulless\r\ninstrument becomes inspired with expression not its own, and produces\r\nmusic instead of noise. The fine organization which can work this\r\nmiracle had not been bestowed on Mrs. Glenarm. She had been carefully\r\ntaught; and she was to be trusted to play correctly--and that was all.\r\nJulius, hungry for music, and reigned to circumstances, asked for no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe servant returned with his answer. Mrs. Glenarm would join Mr.\r\nDelamayn in the music-room in ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99 time.\r\n\r\nJulius rose, relieved, and resumed his sauntering walk; now playing\r\nlittle snatches of music, now stopping to look at the flowers on the\r\nterrace, with an eye that enjoyed their beauty, and a hand that fondled\r\nthem with caressing touch. If Imperial Parliament had seen him at that\r\nmoment, Imperial Parliament must have given notice of a question to\r\nhis illustrious father: Is it possible, my lord, that _you_ can have\r\nbegotten such a Member as this?\r\n\r\nAfter stopping for a moment to tighten one of the strings of his violin,\r\nJulius, raising his head from the instrument, was surprised to see\r\na lady approaching him on the terrace. Advancing to meet her, and\r\nperceiving that she was a total stranger to him, he assumed that she\r\nwas, in all probability, a visitor to his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I the honor of speaking to a friend of Mrs. Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife is not at home, I am sorry to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a stranger to Mrs. Delamayn,\xe2\x80\x9d the lady answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThe servant\r\ninformed me that she had gone out; and that I should find Mr. Delamayn\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulius bowed--and waited to hear more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must beg you to forgive my intrusion,\xe2\x80\x9d the stranger went on. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nobject is to ask permission to see a lady who is, I have been informed,\r\na guest in your house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary formality of the request rather puzzled Julius.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean Mrs. Glenarm?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t think any permission necessary. A friend of Mrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmay take her welcome for granted in this house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not a friend of Mrs. Glenarm. I am a total stranger to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis made the ceremonious request preferred by the lady a little more\r\nintelligible--but it left the lady\xe2\x80\x99s object in wishing to speak to Mrs.\r\nGlenarm still in the dark. Julius politely waited, until it pleased her\r\nto proceed further, and explain herself The explanation did not appear\r\nto be an easy one to give. Her eyes dropped to the ground. She hesitated\r\npainfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name--if I mention it,\xe2\x80\x9d she resumed, without looking up, \xe2\x80\x9cmay\r\npossibly inform you--\xe2\x80\x9d She paused. Her color came and went. She\r\nhesitated again; struggled with her agitation, and controlled it. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nAnne Silvester,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, suddenly raising her pale face, and suddenly\r\nsteadying her trembling voice.\r\n\r\nJulius started, and looked at her in silent surprise.\r\n\r\nThe name was doubly known to him. Not long since, he had heard it from\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s lips, at his father\xe2\x80\x99s bedside. Lord Holchester had charged\r\nhim, had earnestly charged him, to bear that name in mind, and to help\r\nthe woman who bore it, if the woman ever applied to him in time to come.\r\nAgain, he had heard the name, more lately, associated scandalously with\r\nthe name of his brother. On the receipt of the first of the anonymous\r\nletters sent to her, Mrs. Glenarm had not only summoned Geoffrey himself\r\nto refute the aspersion cast upon him, but had forwarded a private copy\r\nof the letter to his relatives at Swanhaven. Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s defense had not\r\nentirely satisfied Julius that his brother was free from blame. As\r\nhe now looked at Anne Silvester, the doubt returned upon him\r\nstrengthened--almost confirmed. Was this woman--so modest, so gentle, so\r\nsimply and unaffectedly refined--the shameless adventuress denounced\r\nby Geoffrey, as claiming him on the strength of a foolish flirtation;\r\nknowing herself, at the time, to be privately married to another man?\r\nWas this woman--with the voice of a lady, the look of a lady, the manner\r\nof a lady--in league (as Geoffrey had declared) with the illiterate\r\nvagabond who was attempting to extort money anonymously from Mrs.\r\nGlenarm? Impossible! Making every allowance for the proverbial\r\ndeceitfulness of appearances, impossible!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour name has been mentioned to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julius, answering her after\r\na momentary pause. His instincts, as a gentleman, made him shrink from\r\nreferring to the association of her name with the name of his brother.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father mentioned you,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, considerately explaining his\r\nknowledge of her in _that_ way, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I last saw him in London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour father!\xe2\x80\x9d She came a step nearer, with a look of distrust as\r\nwell as a look of astonishment in her face. \xe2\x80\x9cYour father is Lord\r\nHolchester--is he not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat made him speak of _me?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was ill at the time,\xe2\x80\x9d Julius answered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he had been thinking of\r\nevents in his past life with which I am entirely unacquainted. He said\r\nhe had known your father and mother. He desired me, if you were ever in\r\nwant of any assistance, to place my services at your disposal. When he\r\nexpressed that wish, he spoke very earnestly--he gave me the impression\r\nthat there was a feeling of regret associated with the recollections on\r\nwhich he had been dwelling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSlowly, and in silence, Anne drew back to the low wall of the terrace\r\nclose by. She rested one hand on it to support herself. Julius had said\r\nwords of terrible import without a suspicion of what he had done. Never\r\nuntil now had Anne Silvester known that the man who had betrayed her was\r\nthe son of that other man whose discovery of the flaw in the marriage\r\nhad ended in the betrayal of her mother before her. She felt the shock\r\nof the revelation with a chill of superstitious dread. Was the chain of\r\na fatality wound invisibly round her? Turn which way she might was she\r\nstill going darkly on, in the track of her dead mother, to an appointed\r\nand hereditary doom? Present things passed from her view as the awful\r\ndoubt cast its shadow over her mind. She lived again for a moment in\r\nthe time when she was a child. She saw the face of her mother once more,\r\nwith the wan despair on it of the bygone days when the title of wife was\r\ndenied her, and the social prospect was closed forever.\r\n\r\nJulius approached, and roused her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I get you any thing?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are looking very ill. I hope I\r\nhave said nothing to distress you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question failed to attract her attention. She put a question herself\r\ninstead of answering it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you say you were quite ignorant of what your father was thinking of\r\nwhen he spoke to you about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite ignorant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your brother likely to know more about it than you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe paused, absorbed once more in her own thoughts. Startled, on the\r\nmemorable day when they had first met, by Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s family name, she\r\nhad put the question to him whether there had not been some acquaintance\r\nbetween their parents in the past time. Deceiving her in all else,\r\nhe had not deceived in this. He had spoken in good faith, when he had\r\ndeclared that he had never heard her father or her mother mentioned at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThe curiosity of Julius was aroused. He attempted to lead her on into\r\nsaying more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou appear to know what my father was thinking of when he spoke to me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe interrupted him with a gesture of entreaty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t ask! It\xe2\x80\x99s past and over--it can have no interest for you--it\r\nhas nothing to do with my errand here. I must return,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on,\r\nhurriedly, \xe2\x80\x9cto my object in trespassing on your kindness. Have you heard\r\nme mentioned, Mr. Delamayn, by another member of your family besides\r\nyour father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulius had not anticipated that sh e would approach, of her own accord,\r\nthe painful subject on which he had himself forborne to touch. He was a\r\nlittle disappointed. He had expected more delicacy of feeling from her\r\nthan she had shown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, coldly, \xe2\x80\x9cto enter on that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe blood rose again in Anne\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it had not been necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think I could have\r\nforced myself to mention it to _you?_ Let me remind you that I am here\r\non sufferance. If I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak plainly (no matter at what sacrifice\r\nto my own feelings), I make my situation more embarrassing than it is\r\nalready. I have something to tell Mrs. Glenarm relating to the anonymous\r\nletters which she has lately received. And I have a word to say to her,\r\nnext, about her contemplated marriage. Before you allow me to do this,\r\nyou ought to know who I am. (I have owned it.) You ought to have heard\r\nthe worst that can be said of my conduct. (Your face tells me you have\r\nheard the worst.) After the forbearance you have shown to me, as a\r\nperfect stranger, I will not commit the meanness of taking you by\r\nsurprise. Perhaps, Mr. Delamayn, you understand, _now,_ why I felt\r\nmyself obliged to refer to your brother. Will you trust me with\r\npermission to speak to Mrs. Glenarm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was simply and modestly said--with an unaffected and touching\r\nresignation of look and manner. Julius gave her back the respect and the\r\nsympathy which, for a moment, he had unjustly withheld from her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have placed a confidence in me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said \xe2\x80\x9cwhich most persons in\r\nyour situation would have withheld. I feel bound, in return to place\r\nconfidence in you. I will take it for granted that your motive in\r\nthis matter is one which it is my duty to respect. It will be for Mrs.\r\nGlenarm to say whether she wishes the interview to take place or not.\r\nAll that I can do is to leave you free to propose it to her. You _are_\r\nfree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the sound of the piano reached them from the music-room.\r\nJulius pointed to the glass door which opened on to the terrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have only to go in by that door,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand you will find Mrs.\r\nGlenarm alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne bowed, and left him. Arrived at the short flight of steps which led\r\nup to the door, she paused to collect her thoughts before she went in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA sudden reluctance to go on and enter the room took possession of\r\nher, as she waited with her foot on the lower step. The report of Mrs.\r\nGlenarm\xe2\x80\x99s contemplated marriage had produced no such effect on her as\r\nSir Patrick had supposed: it had found no love for Geoffrey left to\r\nwound, no latent jealousy only waiting to be inflamed. Her object in\r\ntaking the journey to Perth was completed when her correspondence with\r\nGeoffrey was in her own hands again. The change of purpose which\r\nhad brought her to Swanhaven was due entirely to the new view of her\r\nposition toward Mrs. Glenarm which the coarse commonsense of Bishopriggs\r\nhad first suggested to her. If she failed to protest against Mrs.\r\nGlenarm\xe2\x80\x99s marriage, in the interests of the reparation which Geoffrey\r\nowed to her, her conduct would only confirm Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s audacious\r\nassertion that she was a married woman already. For her own sake\r\nshe might still have hesitated to move in the matter. But Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninterests were concerned as well as her own; and, for Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s sake,\r\nshe had resolved on making the journey to Swanhaven Lodge.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, feeling toward Geoffrey as she felt now--conscious as\r\nshe was of not really desiring the reparation on which she was about\r\nto insist--it was essential to the preservation of her own self-respect\r\nthat she should have some purpose in view which could justify her to her\r\nown conscience in assuming the character of Mrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s rival.\r\n\r\nShe had only to call to mind the critical situation of Blanche--and to\r\nsee her purpose before her plainly. Assuming that she could open the\r\ncoming interview by peaceably proving that her claim on Geoffrey was\r\nbeyond dispute, she might then, without fear of misconception, take the\r\ntone of a friend instead of an enemy, and might, with the best grace,\r\nassure Mrs. Glenarm that she had no rivalry to dread, on the one easy\r\ncondition that she engaged to make Geoffrey repair the evil that he had\r\ndone. \xe2\x80\x9cMarry him without a word against it to dread from _me_--so long\r\nas he unsays the words and undoes the deeds which have thrown a doubt\r\non the marriage of Arnold and Blanche.\xe2\x80\x9d If she could but bring the\r\ninterview to this end--there was the way found of extricating Arnold, by\r\nher own exertions, from the false position in which she had innocently\r\nplaced him toward his wife! Such was the object before her, as she now\r\nstood on the brink of her interview with Mrs. Glenarm.\r\n\r\nUp to this moment, she had firmly believed in her capacity to realize\r\nher own visionary project. It was only when she had her foot on the step\r\nthat a doubt of the success of the coming experiment crossed her mind.\r\nFor the first time, she saw the weak point in her own reasoning. For\r\nthe first time, she felt how much she had blindly taken for granted, in\r\nassuming that Mrs. Glenarm would have sufficient sense of justice and\r\nsufficient command of temper to hear her patiently. All her hopes of\r\nsuccess rested on her own favorable estimate of a woman who was a total\r\nstranger to her! What if the first words exchanged between them proved\r\nthe estimate to be wrong?\r\n\r\nIt was too late to pause and reconsider the position. Julius Delamayn\r\nhad noticed her hesitation, and was advancing toward her from the end\r\nof the terrace. There was no help for it but to master her own\r\nirresolution, and to run the risk boldly. \xe2\x80\x9cCome what may, I have gone\r\ntoo far to stop _here._\xe2\x80\x9d With that desperate resolution to animate her,\r\nshe opened the glass door at the top of the steps, and went into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenarm rose from the piano. The two women--one so richly, the\r\nother so plainly dressed; one with her beauty in its full bloom, the\r\nother worn and blighted; one with society at her feet, the other an\r\noutcast living under the bleak shadow of reproach--the two women stood\r\nface to face, and exchanged the cold courtesies of salute between\r\nstrangers, in silence.\r\n\r\nThe first to meet the trivial necessities of the situation was Mrs.\r\nGlenarm. She good-humoredly put an end to the embarrassment--which the\r\nshy visitor appeared to feel acutely--by speaking first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid the servants have not told you?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Delamayn\r\nhas gone out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon--I have not called to see Mrs. Delamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenarm looked a little surprised. She went on, however, as amiably\r\nas before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Delamayn, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d she suggested. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect him here every\r\nmoment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne explained again. \xe2\x80\x9cI have just parted from Mr. Delamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nGlenarm opened her eyes in astonishment. Anne proceeded. \xe2\x80\x9cI have come\r\nhere, if you will excuse the intrusion--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated--at a loss how to end the sentence. Mrs. Glenarm,\r\nbeginning by this time to feel a strong curiosity as to what might be\r\ncoming next, advanced to the rescue once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t apologize,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I understand that you are\r\nso good as to have come to see _me._ You look tired. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you take a\r\nchair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne could stand no longer. She took the offered chair. Mrs. Glenarm\r\nresumed her place on the music-stool, and ran her fingers idly over the\r\nkeys of the piano. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you see Mr. Delamayn?\xe2\x80\x9d she went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nmost irresponsible of men, except when he has got his fiddle in his\r\nhand! Is he coming in soon? Are we going to have any music? Have you\r\ncome to play with us? Mr. Delamayn is a perfect fanatic in music, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhe? Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t he here to introduce us? I suppose you like the classical\r\nstyle, too? Did you know that I was in the music-room? Might I ask your\r\nname?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrivolous as they were, Mrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s questions were not without their\r\nuse. They gave Anne time to summon her resolution, and to feel the\r\nnecessity of explaining herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am speaking, I believe, to Mrs. Glenarm?\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\r\n\r\nThe good-humored widow smiled and bowed graciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come here, Mrs. Glenarm--by Mr. Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s permission--to ask\r\nleave to speak to you on a matter in which you are interested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s many-ringed fingers paused over the keys of the piano.\r\nMrs. Gle narm\xe2\x80\x99s plump face turned on the stranger with a dawning\r\nexpression of surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed? I am interested in so many matters. May I ask what _this_\r\nmatter is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe flippant tone of the speaker jarred on Anne. If Mrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnature was as shallow as it appeared to be on the surface, there was\r\nlittle hope of any sympathy establishing itself between them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wished to speak to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cabout something that happened\r\nwhile you were paying a visit in the neighborhood of Perth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dawning surprise in Mrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s face became intensified into\r\nan expression of distrust. Her hearty manner vanished under a veil\r\nof conventional civility, drawn over it suddenly. She looked at Anne.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever at the best of times a beauty,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cWretchedly out of\r\nhealth now. Dressed like a servant, and looking like a lady. What _does_\r\nit mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last doubt was not to be borne in silence by a person of Mrs.\r\nGlenarm\xe2\x80\x99s temperament. She addressed herself to the solution of it with\r\nthe most unblushing directness--dextrously excused by the most winning\r\nfrankness of manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy memory for faces is a bad one; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink you heard me just now, when I asked for your name. Have we ever\r\nmet before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet--if I understand what you are referring to--you wish to speak\r\nto me about something which is only interesting to myself and my most\r\nintimate friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou understand me quite correctly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to speak to you\r\nabout some anonymous letters--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the third time, will you permit me to ask for your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall hear it directly--if you will first allow me to finish what\r\nI wanted to say. I wish--if I can--to persuade you that I come here as a\r\nfriend, before I mention my name. You will, I am sure, not be very sorry\r\nto hear that you need dread no further annoyance--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me once more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Glenarm, interposing for the second\r\ntime. \xe2\x80\x9cI am at a loss to know to what I am to attribute this kind\r\ninterest in my affairs on the part of a total stranger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time, her tone was more than politely cold--it was politely\r\nimpertinent. Mrs. Glenarm had lived all her life in good society, and\r\nwas a perfect mistress of the subtleties of refined insolence in her\r\nintercourse with those who incurred her displeasure.\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s sensitive nature felt the wound--but Anne\xe2\x80\x99s patient courage\r\nsubmitted. She put away from her the insolence which had tried to sting,\r\nand went on, gently and firmly, as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe person who wrote to you anonymously,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9calluded to a\r\ncorrespondence. He is no longer in possession of it. The correspondence\r\nhas passed into hands which may be trusted to respect it. It will be put\r\nto no base use in the future--I answer for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou answer for that?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Glenarm. She suddenly leaned\r\nforward over the piano, and fixed her eyes in unconcealed scrutiny on\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s face. The violent temper, so often found in combination with the\r\nweak nature, began to show itself in her rising color, and her lowering\r\nbrow. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do _you_ know what the person wrote?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do\r\n_you_ know that the correspondence has passed into other hands? Who are\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d Before Anne could answer her, she sprang to her feet, electrified\r\nby a new idea. \xe2\x80\x9cThe man who wrote to me spoke of something else besides\r\na correspondence. He spoke of a woman. I have found you out!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nexclaimed, with a burst of jealous fury. \xe2\x80\x9c_You_ are the woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne rose on her side, still in firm possession of her self-control.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Glenarm,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cI warn--no, I entreat you--not to\r\ntake that tone with me. Compose yourself; and I promise to satisfy you\r\nthat you are more interested than you are willing to believe in what I\r\nhave still to say. Pray bear with me for a little longer. I admit that\r\nyou have guessed right. I own that I am the miserable woman who has been\r\nruined and deserted by Geoffrey Delamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s false!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Glenarm. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wretch! Do you come to _me_ with\r\nyour trumped-up story? What does Julius Delamayn mean by exposing me\r\nto this?\xe2\x80\x9d Her indignation at finding herself in the same room with Anne\r\nbroke its way through, not the restraints only, but the common decencies\r\nof politeness. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll ring for the servants!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have you\r\nturned out of the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe tried to cross the fire-place to ring the bell. Anne, who was\r\nstanding nearest to it, stepped forward at the same moment. Without\r\nsaying a word, she motioned with her hand to the other woman to stand\r\nback. There was a pause. The two waited, with their eyes steadily fixed\r\non one another--each with her resolution laid bare to the other\xe2\x80\x99s view.\r\nIn a moment more, the finer nature prevailed. Mrs. Glenarm drew back a\r\nstep in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to you?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mrs. Glenarm. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have no right to be in this\r\nhouse. You have no right to force yourself in here. Leave the room!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s patience--so firmly and admirably preserved thus far--began to\r\nfail her at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care, Mrs. Glenarm!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, still struggling with herself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not naturally a patient woman. Trouble has done much to tame my\r\ntemper--but endurance has its limits. You have reached the limits of\r\nmine. I have a claim to be heard--and after what you have said to me, I\r\n_will_ be heard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no claim! You shameless woman, you are married already. I know\r\nthe man\xe2\x80\x99s name. Arnold Brinkworth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Geoffrey Delamayn tell you that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI decline to answer a woman who speaks of Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn in that\r\nfamiliar way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne advanced a step nearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Geoffrey Delamayn tell you that?\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\r\nThere was a light in her eyes, there was a ring in her voice, which\r\nshowed that she was roused at last. Mrs. Glenarm answered her, this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe lied!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did _not!_ He knew. I believe _him._ I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe _you._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he told you that I was any thing but a single woman--if he told\r\nyou that Arnold Brinkworth was married to any body but Miss Lundie of\r\nWindygates--I say again he lied!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say again--I believe _him,_ and not you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou believe I am Arnold Brinkworth\xe2\x80\x99s wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am certain of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou tell me that to my face?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you to your face--you may have been Geoffrey Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmistress; you are Arnold Brinkworth\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt those words the long restrained anger leaped up in Anne--all the more\r\nhotly for having been hitherto so steadily controlled. In one breathless\r\nmoment the whirlwind of her indignation swept away, not only all\r\nremembrance of the purpose which had brought her to Swanhaven, but\r\nall sense even of the unpardonable wrong which she had suffered at\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s hands. If he had been there, at that moment, and had offered\r\nto redeem his pledge, she would have consented to marry him, while Mrs.\r\nGlenarm s eye was on her--no matter whether she destroyed herself in her\r\nfirst cool moment afterward or not. The small sting had planted itself\r\nat last in the great nature. The noblest woman is only a woman, after\r\nall!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forbid your marriage to Geoffrey Delamayn! I insist on his performing\r\nthe promise he gave me, to make me his wife! I have got it here in his\r\nown words, in his own writing. On his soul, he swears it to me--he will\r\nredeem his pledge. His mistress, did you say? His wife, Mrs. Glenarm,\r\nbefore the week is out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn those wild words she cast back the taunt--with the letter held in\r\ntriumph in her hand.\r\n\r\nDaunted for the moment by the doubt now literally forced on her, that\r\nAnne might really have the claim on Geoffrey which she advanced, Mrs.\r\nGlenarm answered nevertheless with the obstinacy of a woman brought to\r\nbay--with a resolution not to be convinced by conviction itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t give him up!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYour letter is a forgery. You have\r\nno proof. I won\xe2\x80\x99t, I won\xe2\x80\x99t, I won\xe2\x80\x99t give him up!\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, with the\r\nimpotent iteration of an angry child.\r\n\r\nAnne pointed disdainfully to the letter that she held. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is his\r\npledged and written word,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile I live, you will never be\r\nhis wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be his wife the day after the race. I am going to him in\r\nLondon--to warn him against You!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will find me in London, before you--with this in my hand. Do you\r\nknow his writing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held up the letter, open. Mrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s hand flew out with the\r\nstealthy rapidity of a cat\xe2\x80\x99s paw, to seize and destroy it. Quick as she\r\nwas, her rival was quicker still. For an instant they faced each other\r\nbreathless--one with the letter held behind her; one with her hand still\r\nstretched out.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment--before a word more had passed between them--the\r\nglass door opened; and Julius Delamayn appeared in the room.\r\n\r\nHe addressed himself to Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe decided, on the terrace,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you should speak\r\nto Mrs. Glenarm, if Mrs. Glenarm wished it. Do you think it desirable\r\nthat the interview should be continued any longer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s head drooped on her breast. The fiery anger in her was quenched\r\nin an instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been cruelly provoked, Mr. Delamayn,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have\r\nno right to plead that.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked up at him for a moment. The hot\r\ntears of shame gathered in her eyes, and fell slowly over her cheeks.\r\nShe bent her head again, and hid them from him. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only atonement I\r\ncan make,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cis to ask your pardon, and to leave the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn silence, she turned away to the door. In silence, Julius Delamayn\r\npaid her the trifling courtesy of opening it for her. She went out.\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s indignation--suspended for the moment--transferred itself\r\nto Julius.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I have been entrapped into seeing that woman, with your approval,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said, haughtily, \xe2\x80\x9cI owe it to myself, Mr. Delamayn, to follow her\r\nexample, and to leave your house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI authorized her to ask you for an interview, Mrs. Glenarm. If she has\r\npresumed on the permission that I gave her, I sincerely regret it, and I\r\nbeg you to accept my apologies. At the same time, I may venture to add,\r\nin defense of my conduct, that I thought her--and think her still--a\r\nwoman to be pitied more than to be blamed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be pitied did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Glenarm, doubtful whether her\r\nears had not deceived her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be pitied,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Julius.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You_ may find it convenient, Mr. Delamayn, to forget what your brother\r\nhas told us about that person. _I_ happen to remember it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I, Mrs. Glenarm. But, with my experience of Geoffrey--\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nhesitated, and ran his fingers nervously over the strings of his violin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t believe him?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Glenarm.\r\n\r\nJulius declined to admit that he doubted his brother\xe2\x80\x99s word, to the lady\r\nwho was about to become his brother\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite go that length,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI find it difficult to\r\nreconcile what Geoffrey has told us, with Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s manner and\r\nappearance--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer appearance!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Glenarm, in a transport of astonishment and\r\ndisgust. \xe2\x80\x9c_Her_ appearance! Oh, the men! I beg your pardon--I ought to\r\nhave remembered that there is no accounting for tastes. Go on--pray go\r\non!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we compose ourselves with a little music?\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Julius.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI particularly request you will go on,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Glenarm,\r\nemphatically. \xe2\x80\x9cYou find it \xe2\x80\x98impossible to reconcile\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said \xe2\x80\x98difficult.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well. Difficult to reconcile what Geoffrey told us, with Miss\r\nSilvester\xe2\x80\x99s manner and appearance. What next? You had something else to\r\nsay, when I was so rude as to interrupt you. What was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julius. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t find it easy to understand Sir\r\nPatrick Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in permitting Mr. Brinkworth to commit bigamy\r\nwith his niece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute! The marriage of that horrible woman to Mr. Brinkworth\r\nwas a private marriage. Of course, Sir Patrick knew nothing about it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulius owned that this might be possible, and made a second attempt to\r\nlead the angry lady back to the piano. Useless, once more! Though she\r\nshrank from confessing it to herself, Mrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s belief in the\r\ngenuineness of her lover\xe2\x80\x99s defense had been shaken. The tone taken by\r\nJulius--moderate as it was--revived the first startling suspicion of the\r\ncredibility of Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s statement which Anne\xe2\x80\x99s language and conduct\r\nhad forced on Mrs. Glenarm. She dropped into the nearest chair, and\r\nput her handkerchief to her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou always hated poor Geoffrey,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, with a burst of tears. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you\xe2\x80\x99re defaming him to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulius managed her admirably. On the point of answering her seriously,\r\nhe checked himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI always hated poor Geoffrey,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, with\r\na smile. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to be the last person to say that, Mrs. Glenarm!\r\nI brought him all the way from London expressly to introduce him to\r\n_you._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I wish you had left him in London!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs. Glenarm,\r\nshifting suddenly from tears to temper. \xe2\x80\x9cI was a happy woman before I\r\nmet your brother. I can\xe2\x80\x99t give him up!\xe2\x80\x9d she burst out, shifting back\r\nagain from temper to tears. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care if he _has_ deceived me.\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t let another woman have him! I _will_ be his wife!\xe2\x80\x9d She threw\r\nherself theatrically on her knees before Julius. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, _do_ help me to\r\nfind out the truth!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Julius, pity me! I am so fond of\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was genuine distress in her face, there was true feeling in her\r\nvoice. Who would have believed that there were reserves of merciless\r\ninsolence and heartless cruelty in this woman--and that they had been\r\nlavishly poured out on a fallen sister not five minutes since?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do all I can,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julius, raising her. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us talk of it when\r\nyou are more composed. Try a little music,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cjust to quiet\r\nyour nerves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould _you_ like me to play?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Glenarm, becoming a model of\r\nfeminine docility at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\r\n\r\nJulius opened the Sonatas of Mozart, and shouldered his violin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s try the Fifteenth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, placing Mrs. Glenarm at the piano.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will begin with the Adagio. If ever there was divine music written\r\nby mortal man, there it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey began. At the third bar Mrs. Glenarm dropped a note--and the bow of\r\nJulius paused shuddering on the strings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t play!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am so agitated; I am so anxious. How _am_ I\r\nto find out whether that wretch is really married or not? Who can I ask?\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t go to Geoffrey in London--the trainers won\xe2\x80\x99t let me see him. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t appeal to Mr. Brinkworth himself--I am not even acquainted with\r\nhim. Who else is there? Do think, and tell me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was but one chance of making her return to the Adagio--the chance\r\nof hitting on a suggestion which would satisfy and quiet her. Julius\r\nlaid his violin on the piano, and considered the question before him\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are the witnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s story is to be\r\ndepended on, the landlady and the waiter at the inn can speak to the\r\nfacts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLow people!\xe2\x80\x9d objected Mrs. Glenarm. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. People who\r\nmight take advantage of my situation, and be insolent to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulius considered once more; and made another suggestion. With the fatal\r\ningenuity of innocence, he hit on the idea of referring Mrs. Glenarm to\r\nno less a person than Lady Lundie herself!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is our good friend at Windygates,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSome whisper of the\r\nmatter may have reached Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s ears. It may be a little awkward\r\nto call on her (if she _has_ heard any thing) at the time of a serious\r\nfamily disaster. You are the best judge of that, however. All I can do\r\nis to throw out the notion. Windygates isn\xe2\x80\x99t very far off--and something\r\nmight come of it. What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething might come of it! Let it be remembered that Lady Lundie had\r\nbeen left entirely in the dark--that she had written to Sir Patrick in\r\na tone which plainly showed that her self-esteem was wounded and her\r\nsuspicion roused--and that her first intimation of the serious dilemma\r\nin which Arnold Brinkworth stood was now likely, thanks to Julius\r\nDelamayn, to reach her from the lips of a mere acquaintance. Let this\r\nbe remembered; and then let the estimate be formed of what might come of\r\nit--not at Windygates only, but also at Ham Farm!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Julius.\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenarm was enchanted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe very person to go to!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\nam not let in I can easily write--and explain my object as an apology.\r\nLady Lundie is so right-minded, so sympathetic. If she sees no one\r\nelse--I have only to confide my anxieties to her, and I am sure she will\r\nsee me. You will lend me a carriage, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Windygates\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulius took his violin off the pi ano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think me very troublesome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said coaxingly. \xe2\x80\x9cBetween this and\r\nto-morrow we have nothing to do. And it is _such_ music, if you once get\r\ninto the swing of it! Would you mind trying again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenarm was willing to do any thing to prove her gratitude, after\r\nthe invaluable hint which she had just received. At the second trial the\r\nfair pianist\xe2\x80\x99s eye and hand were in perfect harmony. The lovely melody\r\nwhich the Adagio of Mozart\xe2\x80\x99s Fifteenth Sonata has given to violin and\r\npiano flowed smoothly at last--and Julius Delamayn soared to the seventh\r\nheaven of musical delight.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day Mrs. Glenarm and Mrs. Delamayn went together to Windygates\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTENTH SCENE--THE BEDROOM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FORTY-FIRST.\r\n\r\nLADY LUNDIE DOES HER DUTY.\r\n\r\nTHE scene opens on a bedroom--and discloses, in broad daylight, a lady\r\nin bed.\r\n\r\nPersons with an irritable sense of propriety, whose self-appointed duty\r\nit is to be always crying out, are warned to pause before they cry out\r\non this occasion. The lady now presented to view being no less a person\r\nthan Lady Lundie herself, it follows, as a matter of course, that the\r\nutmost demands of propriety are, by the mere assertion of that fact,\r\nabundantly and indisputably satisfied. To say that any thing short of\r\ndirect moral advantage could, by any possibility, accrue to any living\r\ncreature by the presentation of her ladyship in a horizontal, instead\r\nof a perpendicular position, is to assert that Virtue is a question of\r\nposture, and that Respectability ceases to assert itself when it ceases\r\nto appear in morning or evening dress. Will any body be bold enough to\r\nsay that? Let nobody cry out, then, on the present occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Lundie was in bed.\r\n\r\nHer ladyship had received Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s written announcement of the\r\nsudden stoppage of the bridal tour; and had penned the answer to Sir\r\nPatrick--the receipt of which at Ham Farm has been already described.\r\nThis done, Lady Lundie felt it due to herself to take a becoming\r\nposition in her own house, pending the possible arrival of Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreply. What does a right-minded woman do, when she has reason to believe\r\nthat she is cruelly distrusted by the members of her own family? A\r\nright-minded woman feels it so acutely that she falls ill. Lady Lundie\r\nfell ill accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe case being a serious one, a medical practitioner of the highest\r\ngrade in the profession was required to treat it. A physician from the\r\nneighboring town of Kirkandrew was called in.\r\n\r\nThe physician came in a carriage and pair, with the necessary bald head,\r\nand the indispensable white cravat. He felt her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s pulse, and\r\nput a few gentle questions. He turned his back solemnly, as only a great\r\ndoctor can, on his own positive internal conviction that his patient had\r\nnothing whatever the matter with her. He said, with every appearance of\r\nbelieving in himself, \xe2\x80\x9cNerves, Lady Lundie. Repose in bed is essentially\r\nnecessary. I will write a prescription.\xe2\x80\x9d He prescribed, with perfect\r\ngravity: Aromatic Spirits of Ammonia--16 drops. Spirits of Red\r\nLavender--10 drops. Syrup of Orange Peel--2 drams. Camphor Julep--1\r\nounce. When he had written, Misce fiat Hanstus (instead of Mix a\r\nDraught)--when he had added, Ter die Sumendus (instead of To be taken\r\nThree times a day)--and when he had certified to his own Latin, by\r\nputting his initials at the end, he had only to make his bow; to slip\r\ntwo guineas into his pocket; and to go his way, with an approving\r\nprofessional conscience, in the character of a physician who had done\r\nhis duty.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie was in bed. The visible part of her ladyship was perfectly\r\nattired, with a view to the occasion. A fillet of superb white lace\r\nencircled her head. She wore an adorable invalid jacket of white\r\ncambric, trimmed with lace and pink ribbons. The rest was--bed-clothes.\r\nOn a table at her side stood the Red Lavender Draught--in color soothing\r\nto the eye; in flavor not unpleasant to the taste. A book of devotional\r\ncharacter was near it. The domestic ledgers, and the kitchen report\r\nfor the day, were ranged modestly behind the devout book. (Not even\r\nher ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s nerves, observe, were permitted to interfere with her\r\nladyship\xe2\x80\x99s duty.) A fan, a smelling-bottle, and a handkerchief lay\r\nwithin reach on the counterpane. The spacious room was partially\r\ndarkened. One of the lower windows was open, affording her ladyship the\r\nnecessary cubic supply of air. The late Sir Thomas looked at his widow,\r\nin effigy, from the wall opposite the end of the bed. Not a chair was\r\nout of its place; not a vestige of wearing apparel dared to show itself\r\noutside the sacred limits of the wardrobe and the drawers. The sparkling\r\ntreasures of the toilet-table glittered in the dim distance, The jugs\r\nand basins were of a rare and creamy white; spotless and beautiful to\r\nsee. Look where you might, you saw a perfect room. Then look at the\r\nbed--and you saw a perfect woman, and completed the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the day after Anne\xe2\x80\x99s appearance at Swanhaven--toward the end of\r\nthe afternoon.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s own maid opened the door noiselessly, and stole on tip-toe\r\nto the bedside. Her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were closed. Her ladyship suddenly\r\nopened them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot asleep, Hopkins. Suffering. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHopkins laid two cards on the counterpane. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Delamayn, my lady--and\r\nMrs. Glenarm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were told I was ill, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my lady. Mrs. Glenarm sent for me. She went into the library,\r\nand wrote this note.\xe2\x80\x9d Hopkins produced the note, neatly folded in\r\nthree-cornered form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave they gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my lady. Mrs. Glenarm told me Yes or No would do for answer, if you\r\ncould only have the goodness to read this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThoughtless of Mrs. Glenarm--at a time when the doctor insists on\r\nperfect repose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Lundie. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. One sacrifice\r\nmore or less is of very little consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe fortified herself by an application of the smelling-bottle, and\r\nopened the note. It ran thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo grieved, dear Lady Lundie, to hear that you are a prisoner in your\r\nroom! I had taken the opportunity of calling with Mrs. Delamayn, in the\r\nhope that I might be able to ask you a question. Will your inexhaustible\r\nkindness forgive me if I ask it in writing? Have you had any unexpected\r\nnews of Mr. Arnold Brinkworth lately? I mean, have you heard any thing\r\nabout him, which has taken you very much by surprise? I have a serious\r\nreason for asking this. I will tell you what it is, the moment you are\r\nable to see me. Until then, one word of answer is all I expect. Send\r\nword down--Yes, or No. A thousand apologies--and pray get better soon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe singular question contained in this note suggested one of two\r\ninferences to Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Either Mrs. Glenarm had heard a report\r\nof the unexpected return of the married couple to England--or she was in\r\nthe far more interesting and important position of possessing a clew\r\nto the secret of what was going on under the surface at Ham Farm. The\r\nphrase used in the note, \xe2\x80\x9cI have a serious reason for asking this,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n appeared to favor the latter of the two interpretations. Impossible as\r\nit seemed to be that Mrs. Glenarm could know something about Arnold of\r\nwhich Lady Lundie was in absolute ignorance, her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity\r\n(already powerfully excited by Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s mysterious letter) was only\r\nto be quieted by obtaining the necessary explanation forthwith, at a\r\npersonal interview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHopkins,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI must see Mrs. Glenarm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHopkins respectfully held up her hands in horror. Company in the bedroom\r\nin the present state of her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s health!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA matter of duty is involved in this, Hopkins. Give me the glass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHopkins produced an elegant little hand-mirror. Lady Lundie carefully\r\nsurveyed herself in it down to the margin of the bedclothes. Above\r\ncriticism in every respect? Yes--even when the critic was a woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow Mrs. Glenarm up here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a minute or two more the iron-master\xe2\x80\x99s widow fluttered into\r\nthe room--a little over-dressed as usual; and a little profuse in\r\nexpressions of gratitude for her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s kindness, and of anxiety\r\nabout her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s health. Lady Lundie endured it as long as she\r\ncould--then stopped it with a gesture of polite remonstrance, and came\r\nto the point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my dear--about this question in your note? Is it possible you have\r\nheard already that Arnold Brinkworth and his wife have come back from\r\nBaden?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Glenarm opened her eyes in astonishment. Lady Lundie put it\r\nmore plainly. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were to have gone on to Switzerland, you know, for\r\ntheir wedding tour, and they suddenly altered their minds, and came back\r\nto England on Sunday last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Lady Lundie, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that! Have you heard nothing about Mr.\r\nBrinkworth except what you have just told me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Mrs. Glenarm toyed hesitatingly with her parasol.\r\nLady Lundie leaned forward in the bed, and looked at her attentively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have _you_ heard about him?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenarm was embarrassed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so difficult to say,\xe2\x80\x9d she began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can bear any thing but suspense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Lundie. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me the\r\nworst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenarm decided to risk it. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you never heard,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat Mr. Brinkworth might possibly have committed himself with another\r\nlady before he married Miss Lundie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer ladyship first closed her eyes in horror and then searched blindly\r\non the counterpane for the smelling-bottle. Mrs. Glenarm gave it to her,\r\nand waited to see how the invalid bore it before she said any more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are things one _must_ hear,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Lady Lundie. \xe2\x80\x9cI see an act\r\nof duty involved in this. No words can describe how you astonish me. Who\r\ntold you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Geoffrey Delamayn told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer ladyship applied for the second time to the smelling-bottle. \xe2\x80\x9cArnold\r\nBrinkworth\xe2\x80\x99s most intimate friend!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe ought to know if\r\nany body does. This is dreadful. Why should Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn tell\r\n_you?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to marry him,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mrs. Glenarm. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is my excuse,\r\ndear Lady Lundie, for troubling you in this matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie partially opened her eyes in a state of faint bewilderment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake explain yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you heard about the anonymous letters?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Glenarm.\r\n\r\nYes. Lady Lundie had heard about the letters. But only what the public\r\nin general had heard. The name of the lady in the background not\r\nmentioned; and Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn assumed to be as innocent as the\r\nbabe unborn. Any mistake in that assumption? \xe2\x80\x9cGive me your hand, my poor\r\ndear, and confide it all to _me!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not quite innocent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Glenarm. \xe2\x80\x9cHe owned to a foolish\r\nflirtation--all _her_ doing, no doubt. Of course, I insisted on a\r\ndistinct explanation. Had she really any claim on him? Not the shadow of\r\na claim. I felt that I only had his word for that--and I told him so.\r\nHe said he could prove it--he said he knew her to be privately married\r\nalready. Her husband had disowned and deserted her; she was at the\r\nend of her resources; she was desperate enough to attempt any thing. I\r\nthought it all very suspicious--until Geoffrey mentioned the man\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n_That_ certainly proved that he had cast off his wife; for I myself knew\r\nthat he had lately married another person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie suddenly started up from her pillow--honestly agitated;\r\ngenuinely alarmed by this time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Delamayn told you the man\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie fell back on the pillow.\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenarm rose to ring for help. Before she could touch the bell, her\r\nladyship had rallied again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI can confirm it! It\xe2\x80\x99s true, Mrs. Glenarm! it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntrue! Open the silver box on the toilet-table--you will find the key in\r\nit. Bring me the top letter. Here! Look at it. I got this from Blanche.\r\nWhy have they suddenly given up their bridal tour? Why have they gone\r\nback to Sir Patrick at Ham Farm? Why have they put me off with an\r\ninfamous subterfuge to account for it? I felt sure something dreadful\r\nhad happened. Now I know what it is!\xe2\x80\x9d She sank back again, with closed\r\neyes, and repeated the words, in a fierce whisper, to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I\r\nknow what it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenarm read the letter. The reason given for the suspiciously\r\nsudden return of the bride and bridegroom was palpably a\r\nsubterfuge--and, more remarkable still, the name of Anne Silvester was\r\nconnected with it. Mrs. Glenarm became strongly agitated on her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis _is_ a confirmation,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Brinkworth has been found\r\nout--the woman _is_ married to him--Geoffrey is free. Oh, my dear\r\nfriend, what a load of anxiety you have taken off my mind! That vile\r\nwretch--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie suddenly opened her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cthe woman who is at the bottom of all the\r\nmischief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I saw her yesterday. She forced herself in at Swanhaven. She\r\ncalled him Geoffrey Delamayn. She declared herself a single woman. She\r\nclaimed him before my face in the most audacious manner. She shook my\r\nfaith, Lady Lundie--she shook my faith in Geoffrey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Mrs. Glenarm. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you even know that? Why her name is\r\nrepeated half a dozen times in this letter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie uttered a scream that rang through the room. Mrs. Glenarm\r\nstarted to her feet. The maid appeared at the door in terror. Her\r\nladyship motioned to the woman to withdraw again instantly, and then\r\npointed to Mrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me have a minute or two of quiet. I want\r\nnothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe silence in the room was unbroken until Lady Lundie spoke again.\r\nShe asked for Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s letter. After reading it carefully, she laid it\r\naside, and fell for a while into deep thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done Blanche an injustice!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cMy poor Blanche!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think she knows nothing about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am certain of it! You forget, Mrs. Glenarm, that this horrible\r\ndiscovery casts a doubt on my step-daughter\xe2\x80\x99s marriage. Do you think, if\r\nshe knew the truth, she would write of a wretch who has mortally injured\r\nher as she writes here? They have put her off with the excuse that\r\nshe innocently sends to _me._ I see it as plainly as I see you! Mr.\r\nBrinkworth and Sir Patrick are in league to keep us both in the dark.\r\nDear child! I owe her an atonement. If nobody else opens her eyes, I\r\nwill do it. Sir Patrick shall find that Blanche has a friend in Me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA smile--the dangerous smile of an inveterately vindictive woman\r\nthoroughly roused--showed itself with a furtive suddenness on her face.\r\nMrs. Glenarm was a little startled. Lady Lundie below the surface--as\r\ndistinguished from Lady Lundie _on_ the surface--was not a pleasant\r\nobject to contemplate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray try to compose yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Glenarm. \xe2\x80\x9cDear Lady Lundie,\r\nyou frighten me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bland surface of her ladyship appeared smoothly once more; drawn\r\nback, as it were, over the hidden inner self, which it had left for the\r\nmoment exposed to view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me for feeling it!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with the patient sweetness which\r\nso eminently distinguished her in times of trial. \xe2\x80\x9cIt falls a little\r\nheavily on a poor sick woman--innocent of all suspicion, and insulted by\r\nthe most heartless neglect. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me distress you. I shall rally, my\r\ndear; I shall rally! In this dreadful calamity--this abyss of crime and\r\nmisery and deceit--I have no one to depend on but myself. For Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake, the whole thing must be cleared up--probed, my dear, probed to the\r\ndepths. Blanche must take a position that is worthy of her. Blanche must\r\ninsist on her rights, under My protection. Never mind what I suffer, or\r\nwhat I sacrifice. There is a work of justice for poor weak Me to do.\r\nIt shall be done!\xe2\x80\x9d said her ladyship, fanning herself with an aspect of\r\nillimitable resolution. \xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Lady Lundie what can you do? They are all away in the south. And\r\nas for that abominable woman--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie touched Mrs. Glenarm on the shoulder with her fan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have my surprise in store, dear friend, as well as you. That\r\nabominable woman was employed as Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s governess in this house.\r\nWait! that is not all. She left us suddenly--ran away--on the pretense\r\nof being privately married. I know where she went. I can trace what\r\nshe did. I can find out who was with her. I can follow Mr. Brinkworth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproceedings, behind Mr. Brinkworth\xe2\x80\x99s back. I can search out the truth,\r\nwithout depending on people compromised in this black business, whose\r\ninterest it is to deceive me. And I will do it to-day!\xe2\x80\x9d She closed the\r\nfan with a sharp snap of triumph, and settled herself on the pillow in\r\nplacid enjoyment of her dear friend\xe2\x80\x99s surprise.\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenarm drew confidentially closer to the bedside. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you\r\nmanage it?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, eagerly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think me curious. I have my\r\ninterest, too, in getting at the truth. Don\xe2\x80\x99t leave me out of it, pray!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you come back to-morrow, at this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! yes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, then--and you shall know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I be of any use?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan my uncle be of any use?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know where to communicate with Captain Newenden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--he is staying with some friends in Sussex.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe may possibly want his assistance. I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell yet. Don\xe2\x80\x99t keep Mrs.\r\nDelamayn waiting any longer, my dear. I shall expect you to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey exchanged an affectionate embrace. Lady Lundie was left alone.\r\n\r\nHer ladyship resigned herself to meditation, with frowning brow and\r\nclose-shut lips. She looked her full age, and a year or two more, as she\r\nlay thinking, with her head on her hand, and her elbow on the pillow.\r\nAfter committing herself to the physician (and to the red lavender\r\ndraught) the commonest regard for consistency made it necessary that\r\nshe should keep her bed for that day. And yet it was essential that the\r\nproposed inquiries should be instantly set on foot. On the one hand, the\r\nproblem was not an easy one to solve; on the other, her ladyship was\r\nnot an easy one to beat. How to send for the landlady at Craig Fernie,\r\nwithout exciting any special suspicion or remark--was the question\r\nbefore her. In less than five minutes she had looked back into her\r\nmemory of current events at Windygates--and had solved it.\r\n\r\nHer first proceeding was to ring the bell for her maid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I frightened you, Hopkins. The state of my nerves. Mrs.\r\nGlenarm was a little sudden with some news that surprised me. I am\r\nbetter now--and able to attend to the household matters. There is a\r\nmistake in the butcher\xe2\x80\x99s account. Send the cook here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took up the domestic ledger and the kitchen report; corrected the\r\nbutcher; cautioned the cook; and disposed of all arrears of domestic\r\nbusiness before Hopkins was summoned again. Having, in this way,\r\ndextrously prevented the woman from connecting any thing that her\r\nmistress said or did, after Mrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s departure, with any thing\r\nthat might have passed during Mrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s visit, Lady Lundie felt\r\nherself at liberty to pave the way for the investigation on which she\r\nwas determined to enter before she slept that night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much for the indoor arrangements,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must be my prime\r\nminister, Hopkins, while I lie helpless here. Is there any thing wanted\r\nby the people out of doors? The coachman? The gardener?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just seen the gardener, my lady. He came with last week\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccounts. I told him he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see your ladyship to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right. Had he any report to make?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, there was something I wanted to say to him--or to somebody\r\nelse? My memorandum-book, Hopkins. In the basket, on that chair. Why\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t the basket placed by my bedside?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHopkins brought the memorandum-book. Lady Lundie consulted it (without\r\nthe slightest necessity), with the same masterly gravity exhibited\r\nby the doctor when he wrote her prescription (without the slightest\r\nnecessity also).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, recovering the lost remembrance. \xe2\x80\x9cNot the\r\ngardener, but the gardener\xe2\x80\x99s wife. A memorandum to speak to her about\r\nMrs. Inchbare. Observe, Hopkins, the association of ideas. Mrs. Inchbare\r\nis associated with the poultry; the poultry are associated with\r\nthe gardener\xe2\x80\x99s wife; the gardener\xe2\x80\x99s wife is associated with the\r\ngardener--and so the gardener gets into my head. Do you see it? I am\r\nalways trying to improve your mind. You do see it? Very well. Now about\r\nMrs. Inchbare? Has she been here again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not at all sure, Hopkins, that I was right in declining to\r\nconsider the message Mrs. Inchbare sent to me about the poultry. Why\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she offer to take any fowls that I can spare off my hands? She\r\nis a respectable woman; and it is important to me to live on good terms\r\nwith al my neighbors, great and small. Has she got a poultry-yard of her\r\nown at Craig Fernie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my lady. And beautifully kept, I am told.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really don\xe2\x80\x99t see--on reflection, Hopkins--why I should hesitate to\r\ndeal with Mrs. Inchbare. (I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it beneath me to sell the game\r\nkilled on my estate to the poulterer.) What was it she wanted to buy?\r\nSome of my black Spanish fowls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my lady. Your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s black Spaniards are famous all round the\r\nneighborhood. Nobody has got the breed. And Mrs. Inchbare--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWants to share the distinction of having the breed with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady\r\nLundie. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t appear ungracious. I will see her myself, as soon as I\r\nam a little better, and tell her that I have changed my mind. Send\r\none of the men to Craig Fernie with a message. I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep a trifling\r\nmatter of this sort in my memory--send him at once, or I may forget it.\r\nHe is to say I am willing to see Mrs. Inchbare, about the fowls, the\r\nfirst time she finds it convenient to come this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid, my lady--Mrs. Inchbare\xe2\x80\x99s heart is so set on the black\r\nSpaniards--she will find it convenient to come this way at once as fast\r\nas her feet can carry her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, you must take her to the gardener\xe2\x80\x99s wife. Say she is to\r\nhave some eggs--on condition, of course, of paying the price for them.\r\nIf she does come, mind I hear of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHopkins withdrew. Hopkins\xe2\x80\x99s mistress reclined on her comfortable pillows\r\nand fanned herself gently. The vindictive smile reappeared on her face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy I shall be well enough to see Mrs. Inchbare,\xe2\x80\x9d she thought to\r\nherself. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is just possible that the conversation may get beyond\r\nthe relative merits of her poultry-yard and mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA lapse of little more than two hours proved Hopkins\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of the\r\nlatent enthusiasm in Mrs. Inchbare\xe2\x80\x99s character to have been correctly\r\nformed. The eager landlady appeared at Windygates on the heels of the\r\nreturning servant. Among the long list of human weaknesses, a passion\r\nfor poultry seems to have its practical advantages (in the shape\r\nof eggs) as compared with the more occult frenzies for collecting\r\nsnuff-boxes and fiddles, and amassing autographs and old postage-stamps.\r\nWhen the mistress of Craig Fernie was duly announced to the mistress of\r\nWindygates, Lady Lundie developed a sense of humor for the first time\r\nin her life. Her ladyship was feebly merry (the result, no doubt, of the\r\nexhilarating properties of the red lavender draught) on the subject of\r\nMrs. Inchbare and the Spanish fowls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost ridiculous, Hopkins! This poor woman must be suffering from\r\na determination of poultry to the brain. Ill as I am, I should have\r\nthought that nothing could amuse me. But, really, this good creature\r\nstarting up, and rushing here, as you say, as fast as her feet can carry\r\nher--it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to resist it! I positively think I must see\r\nMrs. Inchbare. With my active habits, this imprisonment to my room is\r\ndreadful. I can neither sleep nor read. Any thing, Hopkins, to divert my\r\nmind from myself: It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to get rid of her if she is too much for me.\r\nSend her up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Inchbare made her appearance, courtesying deferentially; amazed at\r\nthe condescension which admitted her within the hallowed precincts of\r\nLady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake a chair,\xe2\x80\x9d said her ladyship, graciously. \xe2\x80\x9cI am suffering from\r\nillness, as you perceive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy certie! sick or well, yer leddyship\xe2\x80\x99s a braw sight to see!\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nMrs. Inchbare profoundly impressed by the elegant costume which illness\r\nassumes when illness appears in the regions of high life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am far from being in a fit state to receive any body,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Lady\r\nLundie. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I had a motive for wishing to speak to you when you next\r\ncame to my house. I failed to treat a proposal you made to me, a short\r\ntime since, in a friendly and neighborly way. I beg you to understand\r\nthat I regret having forgotten the consideration due from a person in\r\nmy position to a person in yours. I am obliged to say this under very\r\nunusual circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d added her ladyship, with a glance round her\r\nmagnificent bedroom, \xe2\x80\x9cthrough your unexpected promptitude in favoring me\r\nwith a call. You have lost no time, Mrs. Inchbare, in profiting by the\r\nmessage which I had the pleasure of sending to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, my leddy, I wasna\xe2\x80\x99 that sure (yer leddyship having ance changed yer\r\nmind) but that ye might e\xe2\x80\x99en change again if I failed to strike, as they\r\nsay, while the iron\xe2\x80\x99s het. I crave yer pardon, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, if I ha\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbeen ower hasty. The pride o\xe2\x80\x99 my hairt\xe2\x80\x99s in my powltry--and the black\r\nSpaniards\xe2\x80\x99 (as they ca\xe2\x80\x99 them) are a sair temptation to me to break the\r\ntenth commandment, sae lang as they\xe2\x80\x99re a\xe2\x80\x99 in yer leddyship\xe2\x80\x99s possession,\r\nand nane o\xe2\x80\x99 them in mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am shocked to hear that I have been the innocent cause of your\r\nfalling into temptation, Mrs. Inchbare! Make your proposal--and I shall\r\nbe happy to meet it, if I can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must e\xe2\x80\x99en be content wi\xe2\x80\x99 what yer leddyship will condescend on. A\r\nhaitch o\xe2\x80\x99 eggs if I can come by naething else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is something else you would prefer to a hatch of eggs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wad prefer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Inchbare, modestly, \xe2\x80\x9ca cock and twa pullets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOpen the case on the table behind you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Lundie, \xe2\x80\x9cand you will\r\nfind some writing paper inside. Give me a sheet of it--and the pencil\r\nout of the tray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEagerly watched by Mrs. Inchbare, she wrote an order to the\r\npoultry-woman, and held it out with a gracious smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake that to the gardener\xe2\x80\x99s wife. If you agree with her about the\r\nprice, you can have the cock and the two pullets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Inchbare opened her lips--no doubt to express the utmost extremity\r\nof human gratitude. Before she had said three words, Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nimpatience to reach the end which she had kept in view from the\r\ntime when Mrs. Glenarm had left the house burst the bounds which had\r\nsuccessfully restrained it thus far. Stopping the landlady without\r\nceremony, she fairly forced the conversation to the subject of Anne\r\nSilvester\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings at the Craig Fernie inn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you getting on at the hotel, Mrs. Inchbare? Plenty of tourists,\r\nI suppose, at this time of year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFull, my leddy (praise Providence), frae the basement to the ceiling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had a visitor, I think, some time since of whom I know something? A\r\nperson--\xe2\x80\x9d She paused, and put a strong constraint on herself. There was\r\nno alternative but to yield to the hard necessity of making her inquiry\r\nintelligible. \xe2\x80\x9cA lady,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cwho came to you about the middle of\r\nlast month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould yer leddyship condescend on her name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie put a still stronger constraint on herself. \xe2\x80\x9cSilvester,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresairve us a\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Inchbare. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will never be the same that\r\ncam\xe2\x80\x99 driftin\xe2\x80\x99 in by hersel\xe2\x80\x99--wi\xe2\x80\x99 a bit bag in her hand, and a husband\r\nleft daidling an hour or mair on the road behind her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt it is the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill she be a freend o\xe2\x80\x99 yer leddyship\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Inchbare, feeling\r\nher ground cautiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Lundie. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt a passing curiosity about\r\nher--nothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Inchbare looked relieved. \xe2\x80\x9cTo tell ye truth, my leddy, there was\r\nnae love lost between us. She had a maisterfu\xe2\x80\x99 temper o\xe2\x80\x99 her ain--and I\r\nwas weel pleased when I\xe2\x80\x99d seen the last of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can quite understand that, Mrs. Inchbare--I know something of her\r\ntemper myself. Did I understand you to say that she came to your hotel\r\nalone, and that her husband joined her shortly afterward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cE\xe2\x80\x99en sae, yer leddyship. I was no\xe2\x80\x99 free to gi\xe2\x80\x99 her house-room in the\r\nhottle till her husband daidled in at her heels and answered for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy I must have seen her husband,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Lundie. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of\r\na man was he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Inchbare replied in much the same words which she had used in\r\nanswering the similar question put by Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh! he was ower young for the like o\xe2\x80\x99 _her._ A pratty man, my\r\nleddy--betwixt tall and short; wi\xe2\x80\x99 bonny brown eyes and cheeks, and fine\r\ncoal-blaik hair. A nice douce-spoken lad. I hae naething to say against\r\nhim--except that he cam\xe2\x80\x99 late one day, and took leg-bail betimes the\r\nnext morning, and left madam behind, a load on my hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe answer produced precisely the same effect on Lady Lundie which it\r\nhad produced on Sir Patrick. She, also, felt that it was too vaguely\r\nlike too many young men of no uncommon humor and complexion to be\r\nrelied on. But her ladyship possessed one immense advantage over her\r\nbrother-in-law in attempting to arrive at the truth. _She_ suspected\r\nArnold--and it was possible, in her case, to assist Mrs. Inchbare\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmemory by hints contributed from her own superior resources of\r\nexperience and observation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad he any thing about him of the look and way of a sailor?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you notice, when you spoke to him, that he had a habit of\r\nplaying with a locket on his watch-chain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he is, het aff to a T!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mrs. Inchbare. \xe2\x80\x9cYer leddyship\xe2\x80\x99s weel\r\nacquented wi\xe2\x80\x99 him--there\xe2\x80\x99s nae doot o\xe2\x80\x99 that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I had seen him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Lundie. \xe2\x80\x9cA modest, well-behaved\r\nyoung man, Mrs. Inchbare, as you say. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me keep you any longer\r\nfrom the poultry-yard. I am transgressing the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s orders in seeing\r\nany body. We quite understand each other now, don\xe2\x80\x99t we? Very glad to\r\nhave seen you. Good-evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo she dismissed Mrs. Inchbare, when Mrs. Inchbare had served her\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nMost women, in her position, would have been content with the\r\ninformation which she had now obtained. But Lady Lundie--having a man\r\nlike Sir Patrick to deal with--determined to be doubly sure of her facts\r\nbefore she ventured on interfering at Ham Farm. She had learned from\r\nMrs. Inchbare that the so-called husband of Anne Silvester had joined\r\nher at Craig Fernie on the day when she arrived at the inn, and had left\r\nher again the next morning. Anne had made her escape from Windygates\r\non the occasion of the lawn-party--that is to say, on the fourteenth of\r\nAugust. On the same day Arnold Brinkworth had taken his departure for\r\nthe purpose of visiting the Scotch property left to him by his aunt. If\r\nMrs. Inchbare was to be depended on, he must have gone to Craig Fernie\r\ninstead of going to his appointed destination--and must, therefore, have\r\narrived to visit his house and lands one day later than the day which he\r\nhad originally set apart for that purpose. If this fact could be proved,\r\non the testimony of a disinterested witness, the case against Arnold\r\nwould be strengthened tenfold; and Lady Lundie might act on her\r\ndiscovery with something like a certainty that her information was to be\r\nrelied on.\r\n\r\nAfter a little consideration she decided on sending a messenger with a\r\nnote of inquiry addressed to Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s steward. The apology she invented\r\nto excuse and account for the strangeness of the proposed question,\r\nreferred it to a little family discussion as to the exact date of\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s arrival at his estate, and to a friendly wager in which the\r\ndifference of opinion had ended. If the steward could state whether his\r\nemployer had arrived on the fourteenth or on the fifteenth of August,\r\nthat was all that would be wanted to decide the question in dispute.\r\n\r\nHaving written in those terms, Lady Lundie gave the necessary directions\r\nfor having the note delivered at the earliest possible hour on the next\r\nmorning; the messenger being ordered to make his way back to Windygates\r\nby the first return train on the same day.\r\n\r\nThis arranged, her ladyship was free to refresh herself with another\r\ndose of the red lavender draught, and to sleep the sleep of the just who\r\nclose their eyes with the composing conviction that they have done their\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe events of the next day at Windygates succeeded each other in due\r\ncourse, as follows:\r\n\r\nThe post arrived, and brought no reply from Sir Patrick. Lady Lundie\r\nentered that incident on her mental register of debts owed by her\r\nbrother-in-law--to be paid, with interest, when the day of reckoning\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nNext in order occurred the return of the messenger with the steward\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nHe had referred to his Diary; and he had discovered that Mr. Brinkworth\r\nhad written beforehand to announce his arrival at his estate for the\r\nfourteenth of August--but that he had not actually appeared until the\r\nfifteenth. The one discovery needed to substantiate Mrs. Inchbare\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nevidence being now in Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s possession, she decided to allow\r\nanother day to pass--on the chance that Sir Patrick might al ter his\r\nmind, and write to her. If no letter arrived, and if nothing more was\r\nreceived from Blanche, she resolved to leave Windygates by the next\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x99s train, and to try the bold experiment of personal interference\r\nat Ham Farm.\r\n\r\nThe third in the succession of events was the appearance of the doctor\r\nto pay his professional visit.\r\n\r\nA severe shock awaited him. He found his patient cured by the draught!\r\nIt was contrary to all rule and precedent; it savored of quackery--the\r\nred lavender had no business to do what the red lavender had done--but\r\nthere she was, nevertheless, up and dressed, and contemplating a journey\r\nto London on the next day but one. \xe2\x80\x9cAn act of duty, doctor, is involved\r\nin this--whatever the sacrifice, I must go!\xe2\x80\x9d No other explanation could\r\nbe obtained. The patient was plainly determined--nothing remained for\r\nthe physician but to retreat with unimpaired dignity and a paid fee.\r\nHe did it. \xe2\x80\x9cOur art,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained to Lady Lundie in confidence, \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nnothing, after all, but a choice between alternatives. For instance. I\r\nsee you--not cured, as you think--but sustained by abnormal excitement.\r\nI have to ask which is the least of the two evils--to risk letting\r\nyou travel, or to irritate you by keeping you at home. With your\r\nconstitution, we must risk the journey. Be careful to keep the window of\r\nthe carriage up on the side on which the wind blows. Let the extremities\r\nbe moderately warm, and the mind easy--and pray don\xe2\x80\x99t omit to provide\r\nyourself with a second bottle of the Mixture before you start.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nmade his bow, as before--he slipped two guineas into his pocket, as\r\nbefore--and he went his way, as before, with an approving conscience,\r\nin the character of a physician who had done his duty. (What an enviable\r\nprofession is Medicine! And why don\xe2\x80\x99t we all belong to it?)\r\n\r\nThe last of the events was the arrival of Mrs. Glenarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d she began, eagerly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat news?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe narrative of her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s discoveries--recited at full length;\r\nand the announcement of her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s resolution--declared in the most\r\nuncompromising terms--raised Mrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s excitement to the highest\r\npitch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou go to town on Saturday?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will go with you. Ever since\r\nthat woman declared she should be in London before me, I have been dying\r\nto hasten my journey--and it is such an opportunity to go with you! I\r\ncan easily manage it. My uncle and I were to have met in London, early\r\nnext week, for the foot-race. I have only to write and tell him of my\r\nchange of plans.--By-the-by, talking of my uncle, I have heard, since I\r\nsaw you, from the lawyers at Perth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore anonymous letters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne more--received by the lawyers this time. My unknown correspondent\r\nhas written to them to withdraw his proposal, and to announce that\r\nhe has left Perth. The lawyers recommended me to stop my uncle from\r\nspending money uselessly in employing the London police. I have\r\nforwarded their letter to the captain; and he will probably be in town\r\nto see his solicitors as soon as I get there with you. So much for\r\nwhat _I_ have done in this matter. Dear Lady Lundie--when we are at our\r\njourney\xe2\x80\x99s end, what do _you_ mean to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy course is plain,\xe2\x80\x9d answered her ladyship, calmly. \xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick will\r\nhear from me, on Sunday morning next, at Ham Farm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTelling him what you have found out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not! Telling him that I find myself called to London by\r\nbusiness, and that I propose paying him a short visit on Monday next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, he must receive you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think there is no doubt of that. Even _his_ hatred of his\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s widow can hardly go to the length--after leaving my letter\r\nunanswered--of closing his doors against me next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow will you manage it when you get there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I get there, my dear, I shall be breathing an atmosphere of\r\ntreachery and deceit; and, for my poor child\xe2\x80\x99s sake (abhorrent as all\r\ndissimulation is to me), I must be careful what I do. Not a word will\r\nescape my lips until I have first seen Blanche in private. However\r\npainful it may be, I shall not shrink from my duty, if my duty compels\r\nme to open her eyes to the truth. Sir Patrick and Mr. Brinkworth will\r\nhave somebody else besides an inexperienced young creature to deal with\r\non Monday next. I shall be there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that formidable announcement, Lady Lundie closed the conversation;\r\nand Mrs. Glenarm rose to take her leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe meet at the Junction, dear Lady Lundie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the Junction, on Saturday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELEVENTH SCENE.--SIR PATRICK\xe2\x80\x99S HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FORTY-SECOND.\r\n\r\nTHE SMOKING-ROOM WINDOW.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI CAN\xe2\x80\x99T believe it! I won\xe2\x80\x99t believe it! You\xe2\x80\x99re trying to part me from\r\nmy husband--you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to set me against my dearest friend. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninfamous. It\xe2\x80\x99s horrible. What have I done to you? Oh, my head! my head!\r\nAre you trying to drive me mad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPale and wild; her hands twisted in her hair; her feet hurrying her\r\naimlessly to and fro in the room--so Blanche answered her step-mother,\r\nwhen the object of Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s pilgrimage had been accomplished, and\r\nthe cruel truth had been plainly told.\r\n\r\nHer ladyship sat, superbly composed, looking out through the window at\r\nthe placid landscape of woods and fields which surrounded Ham Farm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was prepared for this outbreak,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, sadly. \xe2\x80\x9cThese wild words\r\nrelieve your over-burdened heart, my poor child. I can wait, Blanche--I\r\ncan wait!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche stopped, and confronted Lady Lundie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou and I never liked each other,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wrote you a pert letter\r\nfrom this place. I have always taken Anne\xe2\x80\x99s part against you. I have\r\nshown you plainly--rudely, I dare say--that I was glad to be married and\r\nget away from you. This is not your revenge, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Blanche, Blanche, what thoughts to think! what words to say! I can\r\nonly pray for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am mad, Lady Lundie. You bear with mad people. Bear with me. I\r\nhave been hardly more than a fortnight married. I love _him_--I love\r\n_her_--with all my heart. Remember what you have told me about them.\r\nRemember! remember! remember!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe reiterated the words with a low cry of pain. Her hands went up to\r\nher head again; and she returned restlessly to pacing this way and that\r\nin the room.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie tried the effect of a gentle remonstrance. \xe2\x80\x9cFor your own\r\nsake,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t persist in estranging yourself from me. In this\r\ndreadful trial, I am the only friend you have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche came back to her step-mother\xe2\x80\x99s chair; and looked at her\r\nsteadily, in silence. Lady Lundie submitted to inspection--and bore it\r\nperfectly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook into my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBlanche! it bleeds for you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche heard, without heeding. Her mind was painfully intent on its\r\nown thoughts. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a religious woman,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, abruptly. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you\r\nswear on your Bible, that what you told me is true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_My_ Bible!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Lady Lundie with sorrowful emphasis. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my\r\nchild! have _you_ no part in that precious inheritance? Is it not _your_\r\nBible, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA momentary triumph showed itself in Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cYou daren\xe2\x80\x99t swear\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s enough for me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned away scornfully. Lady Lundie caught her by the hand, and drew\r\nher sharply back. The suffering saint disappeared, and the woman who was\r\nno longer to be trifled with took her place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere must be an end to this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t believe what I have\r\ntold you. Have you courage enough to put it to the test?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche started, and released her hand. She trembled a little. There\r\nwas a horrible certainty of conviction expressed in Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s sudden\r\nchange of manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see. Tell me the truth, on your side, first. Where is Sir\r\nPatrick? Is he really out, as his servant told me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. He is out with the farm bailiff. You have taken us all by\r\nsurprise. You wrote that we were to expect you by the next train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen does the next train arrive? It is eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetween one and two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick will not be back till then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot till then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Mr. Brinkworth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour husband--if you like. Is he out, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is in the smoking-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean the long room, built out from the back of the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome down stairs at once with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche advanced a step--and drew back. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want of me?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked, inspired by a sudden distrust.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie turned round, and looked at her impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you see yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, sharply, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your interest and my\r\ninterest in this matter are one? What have I told you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t repeat it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must repeat it! I have told you that Arnold Brinkworth was privately\r\nat Craig Fernie, with Miss Silvester, in the acknowledged character of\r\nher husband--when we supposed him to be visiting the estate left him\r\nby his aunt. You refuse to believe it--and I am about to put it to\r\nthe proof. Is it your interest or is it not, to know whether this man\r\ndeserves the blind belief that you place in him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche trembled from head to foot, and made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going into the garden, to speak to Mr. Brinkworth through the\r\nsmoking-room window,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued her ladyship. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you the courage to\r\ncome with me; to wait behind out of sight; and to hear what he says with\r\nhis own lips? I am not afraid of putting it to that test. Are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone in which she asked the question roused Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s spirit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I believed him to be guilty,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, resolutely, \xe2\x80\x9cI should _not_\r\nhave the courage. I believe him to be innocent. Lead the way, Lady\r\nLundie, as soon as you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey left the room--Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s own room at Ham Farm--and descended to the\r\nhall. Lady Lundie stopped, and consulted the railway time-table hanging\r\nnear the house-door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a train to London at a quarter to twelve,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long\r\ndoes it take to walk to the station?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will soon know. Answer my question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a walk of twenty minutes to the station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie referred to her watch. \xe2\x80\x9cThere will be just time,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime for what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome into the garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that answer, she led the way out\r\n\r\nThe smoking-room projected at right angles from the wall of the house,\r\nin an oblong form--with a bow-window at the farther end, looking into\r\nthe garden. Before she turned the corner, and showed herself within the\r\nrange of view from the window Lady Lundie looked back, and signed to\r\nBlanche to wait behind the angle of the wall. Blanche waited.\r\n\r\nThe next instant she heard the voices in conversation through the open\r\nwindow. Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s voice was the first that spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Lundie! Why, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect you till luncheon time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie was ready with her answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was able to leave town earlier than I had anticipated. Don\xe2\x80\x99t put out\r\nyour cigar; and don\xe2\x80\x99t move. I am not coming in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe quick interchange of question and answer went on; every word being\r\naudible in the perfect stillness of the place. Arnold was the next to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen Blanche?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlanche is getting ready to go out with me. We mean to have a walk\r\ntogether. I have many things to say to her. Before we go, I have\r\nsomething to say to _you._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it any thing very serious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is most serious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout you. I know where you went on the evening of my lawn-party at\r\nWindygates--you went to Craig Fernie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Heavens! how did you find out--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know whom you went to meet--Miss Silvester. I know what is said of\r\nyou and of her--you are man and wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! don\xe2\x80\x99t speak so loud. Somebody may hear you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it matter if they do? I am the only person whom you have kept\r\nout of the secret. You all of you know it here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of the sort! Blanche doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Neither you nor Sir Patrick has told Blanche of the situation you\r\nstand in at this moment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet. Sir Patrick leaves it to me. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to bring\r\nmyself to do it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t say a word, I entreat you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nBlanche may interpret it. Her friend is expected in London to-morrow. I\r\nwant to wait till Sir Patrick can bring them together. Her friend will\r\nbreak it to her better than I can. It\xe2\x80\x99s _my_ notion. Sir Patrick thinks\r\nit a good one. Stop! you\xe2\x80\x99re not going away already?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will be here to look for me if I stay any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word! I want to know--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall know later in the day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHer ladyship appeared again round the angle of the wall. The next words\r\nthat passed were words spoken in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you satisfied now, Blanche?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you mercy enough left, Lady Lundie, to take me away from this\r\nhouse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child! Why else did I look at the time-table in the hall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FORTY-THIRD.\r\n\r\nTHE EXPLOSION.\r\n\r\nARNOLD\xe2\x80\x99S mind was far from easy when he was left by himself again in the\r\nsmoking-room.\r\n\r\nAfter wasting some time in vainly trying to guess at the source from\r\nwhich Lady Lundie had derived her information, he put on his hat, and\r\ntook the direction which led to Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s favorite walk at Ham Farm.\r\nWithout absolutely distrusting her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s discretion, the idea\r\nhad occurred to him that he would do well to join his wife and her\r\nstep-mother. By making a third at the interview between them, he might\r\nprevent the conversation from assuming a perilously confidential turn.\r\n\r\nThe search for the ladies proved useless. They had not taken the\r\ndirection in which he supposed them to have gone.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the smoking-room, and composed himself to wait for events\r\nas patiently as he might. In this passive position--with his\r\nthoughts still running on Lady Lundie--his memory reverted to a brief\r\nconversation between Sir Patrick and himself, occasioned, on the\r\nprevious day, by her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s announcement of her proposed visit to\r\nHam Farm. Sir Patrick had at once expressed his conviction that his\r\nsister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s journey south had some acknowledged purpose at the\r\nbottom of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not at all sure, Arnold\xe2\x80\x9d (he had said), \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have done wisely\r\nin leaving her letter unanswered. And I am strongly disposed to think\r\nthat the safest course will be to take her into the secret when she\r\ncomes to-morrow. We can\xe2\x80\x99t help the position in which we are placed.\r\nIt was impossible (without admitting your wife to our confidence) to\r\nprevent Blanche from writing that unlucky letter to her--and, even if\r\nwe had prevented it, she must have heard in other ways of your return to\r\nEngland. I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt my own discretion, so far; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt the\r\nconvenience of keeping her in the dark, as a means of keeping her from\r\nmeddling in this business of yours, until I have had time to set it\r\nright. But she may, by some unlucky accident, discover the truth for\r\nherself--and, in that case, I strongly distrust the influence which she\r\nmight attempt to exercise on Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose were the words--and what had happened on the day after they had\r\nbeen spoken? Lady Lundie _had_ discovered the truth; and she was, at\r\nthat moment, alone somewhere with Blanche. Arnold took up his hat once\r\nmore, and set forth on the search for the ladies in another direction.\r\n\r\nThe second expedition was as fruitless as the first. Nothing was to be\r\nseen, and nothing was to be heard, of Lady Lundie and Blanche.\r\n\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s watch told him that it was not far from the time when Sir\r\nPatrick might be expected to return. In all probability, while he had\r\nbeen looking for them, the ladies had gone back by some other way to the\r\nhouse. He entered the rooms on the ground-floor, one after another. They\r\nwere all empty. He went up stairs, and knocked at the door of Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom. There was no answer. He opened the door and looked in. The room\r\nwas empty, like the rooms down stairs. But, close to the entrance, there\r\nwas a trifling circumstance to attract notice, in the shape of a note\r\nlying on the carpet. He picked it up, and saw that it was addressed to\r\nhim in the handwriting of his wife.\r\n\r\nHe opened it. The note began, without the usual form of address, in\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know the abominable secret that you and my uncle have hidden from\r\nme. I know _your_ infamy, and _her_ infamy, and the position in which,\r\nthanks to you and to her, I now stand. Reproaches would be wasted words,\r\naddressed to such a man as you are. I write these lines to tell you that\r\nI have placed myself under my step-mother\xe2\x80\x99s protection in London. It\r\nis useless to attempt to follow me. Others will find out whether the\r\nceremony of marriage which you went through with me is binding on you or\r\nnot. For myself, I know enough already. I have gone, never to come back,\r\nand never to let you see me again.--Blanche.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHurrying headlong down the stairs with but one clear idea in his\r\nmind--the idea of instantly following his wife--Arnold encountered Sir\r\nPatrick, standing by a table in the hall, on which cards and notes left\r\nby visitors were usually placed, with an open letter in his hand. Seeing\r\nin an instant what had happened, he threw one of his arms round Arnold,\r\nand stopped him at the house-door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cBear it like a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s head fell on the shoulder of his kind old friend. He burst into\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick let the irrepressible outbreak of grief have its way. In\r\nthose first moments, silence was mercy. He said nothing. The letter\r\nwhich he had been reading (from Lady Lundie, it is needless to say),\r\ndropped unheeded at his feet.\r\n\r\nArnold lifted his head, and dashed away the tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ashamed of myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrong, my poor fellow--doubly wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is\r\nno shame in shedding such tears as those. And there is nothing to be\r\ndone by leaving _me._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must and will see her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick, pointing to the letter on the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cSee\r\nyour wife? Your wife is with the woman who has written those lines. Read\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold read them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR SIR PATRICK,--If you had honored me with your confidence, I should\r\nhave been happy to consult you before I interfered to rescue Blanche\r\nfrom the position in which Mr. Brinkworth has placed her. As it is, your\r\nlate brother\xe2\x80\x99s child is under my protection at my house in London. If\r\n_you_ attempt to exercise your authority, it must be by main force--I\r\nwill submit to nothing less. If Mr. Brinkworth attempts to exercise\r\n_his_ authority, he shall establish his right to do so (if he can) in a\r\npolice-court.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery truly yours, JULIA LUNDIE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s resolution was not to be shaken even by this. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I care,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he burst out, hotly, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether I am dragged through the streets by\r\nthe police or not! I _will_ see my wife. I _will_ clear myself of the\r\nhorrible suspicion she has about me. You have shown me your letter. Look\r\nat mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s clear sense saw the wild words that Blanche had written in\r\ntheir true light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hold your wife responsible for that letter?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI see\r\nher step-mother in every line of it. You descend to something unworthy\r\nof you, if you seriously defend yourself against _this!_ You can\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nit? You persist in holding to your own view? Write, then. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nto her--your letter may. No! When you leave this house, you leave it\r\nwith me. I have conceded something on my side, in allowing you to write.\r\nI insist on your conceding something, on your side, in return. Come into\r\nthe library! I answer for setting things right between you and Blanche,\r\nif you will place your interests in my hands. Do you trust me or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold yielded. They went into the library together. Sir Patrick pointed\r\nto the writing-table. \xe2\x80\x9cRelieve your mind there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd let me\r\nfind you a reasonable man again when I come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to the library the letter was written; and Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind was so far relieved--for the time at least.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall take your letter to Blanche myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cby the\r\ntrain that leaves for London in half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will let me go with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to-day. I shall be back this evening to dinner. You shall hear all\r\nthat has happened; and you shall accompany me to London to-morrow--if\r\nI find it necessary to make any lengthened stay there. Between this and\r\nthen, after the shock that you have suffered, you will do well to be\r\nquiet here. Be satisfied with my assurance that Blanche shall have your\r\nletter. I will force my authority on her step-mother to that extent (if\r\nher step-mother resists) without scruple. The respect in which I hold\r\nthe sex only lasts as long as the sex deserves it--and does _not_ extend\r\nto Lady Lundie. There is no advantage that a man can take of a woman\r\nwhich I am not fully prepared to take of my sister-in-law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that characteristic farewell, he shook hands with Arnold, and\r\ndeparted for the station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the dinner was on the table. At seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock Sir\r\nPatrick came down stairs to eat it, as perfectly dressed as usual, and\r\nas composed as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has got your letter,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, as he took Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and\r\nled him into the dining-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she say any thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did she look?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs she ought to look--sorry for what she has done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dinner began. As a matter of necessity, the subject of Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexpedition was dropped while the servants were in the room--to be\r\nregularly taken up again by Arnold in the intervals between the courses.\r\nHe began when the soup was taken away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI confess I had hoped to see Blanche come back with you!\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nsadly enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn other words,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cyou forgot the native obstinacy\r\nof the sex. Blanche is beginning to feel that she has been wrong. What\r\nis the necessary consequence? She naturally persists in being wrong.\r\nLet her alone, and leave your letter to have its effect. The serious\r\ndifficulties in our way don\xe2\x80\x99t rest with Blanche. Content yourself with\r\nknowing that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fish came in, and Arnold was silenced--until his next opportunity\r\ncame with the next interval in the course of the dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are the difficulties?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe difficulties are my difficulties and yours,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sir Patrick.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy difficulty is, that I can\xe2\x80\x99t assert my authority, as guardian, if\r\nI assume my niece (as I do) to be a married woman. Your difficulty\r\nis, that you can\xe2\x80\x99t assert your authority as her husband, until it is\r\ndistinctly proved that you and Miss Silvester are not man and wife. Lady\r\nLundie was perfectly aware that she would place us in that position,\r\nwhen she removed Blanche from this house. She has cross-examined Mrs.\r\nInchbare; she has written to your steward for the date of your arrival\r\nat your estate; she has done every thing, calculated every thing, and\r\nforeseen every thing--except my excellent temper. The one mistake she\r\nhas made, is in thinking she could get the better of _that._ No, my dear\r\nboy! My trump card is my temper. I keep it in my hand, Arnold--I keep it\r\nin my hand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next course came in--and there was an end of the subject again.\r\nSir Patrick enjoyed his mutton, and entered on a long and interesting\r\nnarrative of the history of some rare white Burgundy on the table\r\nimported by himself. Arnold resolutely resumed the discussion with the\r\ndeparture of the mutton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to be a dead lock,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo slang!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Sir, consider my anxiety, and tell me what you\r\npropose to do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI propose to take you to London with me to-morrow, on this\r\ncondition--that you promise me, on your word of honor, not to attempt to\r\nsee your wife before Saturday next.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall see her then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you give me your promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do! I do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next course came in. Sir Patrick entered on the question of the\r\nmerits of the partridge, viewed as an eatable bird, \xe2\x80\x9cBy himself,\r\nArnold--plainly roasted, and tested on his own merits--an overrated\r\nbird. Being too fond of shooting him in this country, we become too fond\r\nof eating him next. Properly understood, he is a vehicle for sauce and\r\ntruffles--nothing more. Or no--that is hardly doing him justice. I am\r\nbound to add that he is honorably associated with the famous French\r\nreceipt for cooking an olive. Do you know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an end of the bird; there was an end of the jelly. Arnold got\r\nhis next chance--and took it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to be done in London to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cis a memorable day in our calendar.\r\nTo-morrow is Tuesday--the day on which I am to see Miss Silvester.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold set down the glass of wine which he was just raising to his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter what has happened,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI can hardly bear to hear her name\r\nmentioned. Miss Silvester has parted me from my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Silvester may atone for that, Arnold, by uniting you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has been the ruin of me so far.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe may be the salvation of you yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cheese came in; and Sir Patrick returned to the Art of Cookery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the receipt for cooking an olive, Arnold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _does_ the new generation know? It knows how to row, how to shoot,\r\nhow to play at cricket, and how to bat. When it has lost its muscle and\r\nlost its money--that is to say, when it has grown old--what a generation\r\nit will be! It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter: I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t live to see it. Are you\r\nlistening, Arnold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow to cook an olive! Put an olive into a lark, put a lark into a\r\nquail; put a quail into a plover; put a plover into a partridge; put a\r\npartridge into a pheasant; put a pheasant into a turkey. Good. First,\r\npartially roast, then carefully stew--until all is thoroughly done down\r\nto the olive. Good again. Next, open the window. Throw out the turkey,\r\nthe pheasant, the partridge, the plover, the quail, and the lark. _Then,\r\neat the olive._ The dish is expensive, but (we have it on the highest\r\nauthority) well worth the sacrifice. The quintessence of the flavor of\r\nsix birds, concentrated in one olive. Grand idea! Try another glass of\r\nthe white Burgundy, Arnold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last the servants left them--with the wine and dessert on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have borne it as long as I can, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold. \xe2\x80\x9cAdd to all your\r\nkindness to me by telling me at once what happened at Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a chilly evening. A bright wood fire was burning in the room. Sir\r\nPatrick drew his chair to the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is exactly what happened,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI found company at Lady\r\nLundie\xe2\x80\x99s, to begin with. Two perfect strangers to me. Captain Newenden,\r\nand his niece, Mrs. Glenarm. Lady Lundie offered to see me in another\r\nroom; the two strangers offered to withdraw. I declined both proposals.\r\nFirst check to her ladyship! She has reckoned throughout, Arnold, on our\r\nbeing afraid to face public opinion. I showed her at starting that we\r\nwere as ready to face it as she was. \xe2\x80\x98I always accept what the French\r\ncall accomplished facts,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98You have brought matters to a crisis,\r\nLady Lundie. So let it be. I have a word to say to my niece (in\r\nyour presence, if you like); and I have another word to say to you\r\nafterward--without presuming to disturb your guests.\xe2\x80\x99 The guests sat\r\ndown again (both naturally devoured by curiosity). Could her ladyship\r\ndecently refuse me an interview with my own niece, while two witnesses\r\nwere looking on? Impossible. I saw Blanche (Lady Lundie being present,\r\nit is needless to say) in the back drawing-room. I gave her your\r\nletter; I said a good word for you; I saw that she was sorry, though\r\nshe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t own it--and that was enough. We went back into the front\r\ndrawing-room. I had not spoken five words on our side of the question\r\nbefore it appeared, to my astonishment and delight, that Captain\r\nNewenden was in the house on the very question that had brought me into\r\nthe house--the question of you and Miss Silvester. My business, in the\r\ninterests of _my_ niece, was to deny your marriage to the lady. His\r\nbusiness, in the interests of _his_ niece, was to assert your marriage\r\nto the lady. To the unutterable disgust of the two women, we joined\r\nissue, in the most friendly manner, on the spot. \xe2\x80\x98Charmed to have the\r\npleasure of meeting you, Captain Newenden.\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98Delighted to have the\r\nhonor of making your acquaintance, Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98I think we can settle\r\nthis in two minutes?\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98My own idea perfectly expressed.\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98State your\r\nposition, Captain.\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98With the greatest pleasure. Here is my niece,\r\nMrs. Glenarm, engaged to marry Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn. All very well,\r\nbut there happens to be an obstacle--in the shape of a lady. Do I put\r\nit plainly?\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98You put it admirably, Captain; but for the loss to the\r\nBritish navy, you ought to have been a lawyer. Pray, go on.\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98You are\r\ntoo good, Sir Patrick. I resume. Mr. Delamayn asserts that this person\r\nin the back-ground has no claim on him, and backs his assertion by\r\ndeclaring that she is married already to Mr. Arnold Brinkworth. Lady\r\nLundie and my niece assure me, on evidence which satisfies _them,_ that\r\nthe assertion is true. The evidence does not satisfy _me._ \xe2\x80\x98I hope, Sir\r\nPatrick, I don\xe2\x80\x99t strike you as being an excessively obstinate man?\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98My\r\ndear Sir, you impress me with the highest opinion of your capacity\r\nfor sifting human testimony! May I ask, next, what course you mean to\r\ntake?\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98The very thing I was going to mention, Sir Patrick! This is\r\nmy course. I refuse to sanction my niece\xe2\x80\x99s engagement to Mr. Delamayn,\r\nuntil Mr. Delamayn has actually proved his statement by appeal to\r\nwitnesses of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s marriage. He refers me to two witnesses; but\r\ndeclines acting at once in the matter for himself, on the ground that\r\nhe is in training for a foot-race. I admit that that is an obstacle, and\r\nconsent to arrange for bringing the two witnesses to London myself. By\r\nthis post I have written to my lawyers in Perth to look the witnesses\r\nup; to offer them the necessary terms (at Mr. Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s expense) for\r\nthe use of their time; and to produce them by the end of the week. The\r\nfootrace is on Thursday next. Mr. Delamayn will be able to attend after\r\nthat, and establish his own assertion by his own witnesses. What do you\r\nsay, Sir Patrick, to Saturday next (with Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s permission) in\r\nthis room?\xe2\x80\x99--There is the substance of the captain\xe2\x80\x99s statement. He is\r\nas old as I am and is dressed to look like thirty; but a very pleasant\r\nfellow for all that. I struck my sister-in-law dumb by accepting the\r\nproposal without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation. Mrs. Glenarm and Lady Lundie\r\nlooked at each other in mute amazement. Here was a difference about\r\nwhich two women would have mortally quarreled; and here were two men\r\nsettling it in the friendliest possible manner. I wish you had seen\r\nLady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s face, when I declared myself deeply indebted to Captain\r\nNewenden for rendering any prolonged interview with her ladyship quite\r\nunnecessary. \xe2\x80\x98Thanks to the captain,\xe2\x80\x99 I said to her, in the most cordial\r\nmanner, \xe2\x80\x98we have absolutely nothing to discuss. I shall catch the next\r\ntrain, and set Arnold Brinkworth\xe2\x80\x99s mind quite at ease.\xe2\x80\x99 To come back to\r\nserious things, I have engaged to produce you, in the presence of every\r\nbody--your wife included--on Saturday next. I put a bold face on it\r\nbefore the others. But I am bound to tell _you_ that it is by no means\r\neasy to say--situated as we are now--what the result of Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninquiry will be. Every thing depends on the issue of my interview with\r\nMiss Silvester to-morrow. It is no exaggeration to say, Arnold, that\r\nyour fate is in her hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to heaven I had never set eyes on her!\xe2\x80\x9d said Arnold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLay the saddle on the right horse,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cWish you had\r\nnever set eyes on Geoffrey Delamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArnold hung his head. Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s sharp tongue had got the better of\r\nhim once more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWELFTH SCENE.--DRURY LANE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FORTY-FOURTH.\r\n\r\nTHE LETTER AND THE LAW.\r\n\r\nTHE many-toned murmur of the current of London life--flowing through the\r\nmurky channel of Drury Lane--found its muffled way from the front room\r\nto the back. Piles of old music lumbered the dusty floor. Stage masks\r\nand weapons, and portraits of singers and dancers, hung round the walls.\r\nAn empty violin case in one corner faced a broken bust of Rossini in\r\nanother. A frameless print, representing the Trial of Queen Caroline,\r\nwas pasted over the fireplace. The chairs were genuine specimens of\r\nancient carving in oak. The table was an equally excellent example of\r\ndirty modern deal. A small morsel of drugget was on the floor; and a\r\nlarge deposit of soot was on the ceiling. The scene thus presented,\r\nrevealed itself in the back drawing-room of a house in Drury Lane,\r\ndevoted to the transaction of musical and theatrical business of the\r\nhumbler sort. It was late in the afternoon, on Michaelmas-day. Two\r\npersons were seated together in the room: they were Anne Silvester and\r\nSir Patrick Lundie.\r\n\r\nThe opening conversation between them--comprising, on one side, the\r\nnarrative of what had happened at Perth and at Swanhaven; and, on the\r\nother, a statement of the circumstances attending the separation of\r\nArnold and Blanche--had come to an end. It rested with Sir Patrick\r\nto lead the way to the next topic. He looked at his companion, and\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you feel strong enough to go on?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you would prefer to\r\nrest a little, pray say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Sir Patrick. I am more than ready, I am eager to go on. No\r\nwords can say how anxious I feel to be of some use to you, if I can. It\r\nrests entirely with your experience to show me how.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can only do that, Miss Silvester, by asking you without ceremony\r\nfor all the information that I want. Had you any object in traveling to\r\nLondon, which you have not mentioned to me yet? I mean, of course, any\r\nobject with which I have a claim (as Arnold Brinkworth\xe2\x80\x99s representative)\r\nto be acquainted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had an object, Sir Patrick. And I have failed to accomplish it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask what it was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was to see Geoffrey Delamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick started. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have attempted to see _him!_ When?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you only arrived in London last night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only arrived,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cafter waiting many days on the journey. I\r\nwas obliged to rest at Edinburgh, and again at York--and I was afraid\r\nI had given Mrs. Glenarm time enough to get to Geoffrey Delamayn before\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cI understood that you had no serious\r\nintention of disputing the scoundrel with Mrs. Glenarm. What motive\r\ncould possibly have taken you _his_ way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same motive which took me to Swanhaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! the idea that it rested with Delamayn to set things right? and\r\nthat you might bribe him to do it, by consenting to release him, so far\r\nas your claims were concerned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBear with my folly, Sir Patrick, as patiently as you can! I am always\r\nalone now; and I get into a habit of brooding over things. I have been\r\nbrooding over the position in which my misfortunes have placed Mr.\r\nBrinkworth. I have been obstinate--unreasonably obstinate--in believing\r\nthat I could prevail with Geoffrey Delamayn, after I had failed with\r\nMrs. Glenarm. I am obstinate about it still. If he would only have heard\r\nme, my madness in going to Fulham might have had its excuse.\xe2\x80\x9d She sighed\r\nbitterly, and said no more.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick took her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _has_ its excuse,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cYour motive is beyond reproach.\r\nLet me add--to quiet your mind--that, even if Delamayn had been willing\r\nto hear you, and had accepted the condition, the result would still\r\nhave been the same. You are quite wrong in supposing that he has only to\r\nspeak, and to set this matter right. It has passed entirely beyond\r\nhis control. The mischief was done when Arnold Brinkworth spent those\r\nunlucky hours with you at Craig Fernie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Sir Patrick, if I had only known that, before I went to Fulham this\r\nmorning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shuddered as she said the words. Something was plainly associated\r\nwith her visit to Geoffrey, the bare remembrance of which shook her\r\nnerves. What was it? Sir Patrick resolved to obtain an answer to that\r\nquestion, before he ventured on proceeding further with the main object\r\nof the interview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have told me your reason for going to Fulham,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I have\r\nnot heard what happened there yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it necessary for me to trouble you about that?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked--with evident reluctance to enter on the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is absolutely necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause Delamayn is\r\nconcerned in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne summoned her resolution, and entered on her narrative in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe person who carries on the business here discovered the address for\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d she began. \xe2\x80\x9cI had some difficulty, however, in finding the house.\r\nIt is little more than a cottage; and it is quite lost in a great\r\ngarden, surrounded by high walls. I saw a carriage waiting. The coachman\r\nwas walking his horses up and down--and he showed me the door. It was a\r\nhigh wooden door in the wall, with a grating in it. I rang the bell. A\r\nservant-girl opened the grating, and looked at me. She refused to let\r\nme in. Her mistress had ordered her to close the door on all\r\nstrangers--especially strangers who were women. I contrived to pass some\r\nmoney to her through the grating, and asked to speak to her mistress.\r\nAfter waiting some time, I saw another face behind the bars--and it\r\nstruck me that I recognized it. I suppose I was nervous. It startled me.\r\nI said, \xe2\x80\x98I think we know each other.\xe2\x80\x99 There was no answer. The door was\r\nsuddenly opened--and who do you think stood before me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it somebody I know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMan? or woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was Hester Dethridge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHester Dethridge!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Dressed just as usual, and looking just as usual--with her slate\r\nhanging at her side.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAstonishing! Where did I last see her? At the Windygates station, to\r\nbe sure--going to London, after she had left my sister-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s service.\r\nHas she accepted another place--without letting me know first, as I told\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is living at Fulham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn service?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. As mistress of her own house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Hester Dethridge in possession of a house of her own? Well! well!\r\nwhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she have a rise in the world like other people? Did she\r\nlet you in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe stood for some time looking at me, in that dull strange way that\r\nshe has. The servants at Windygates always said she was not in her right\r\nmind--and you will say, Sir Patrick, when you hear what happened, that\r\nthe servants were not mistaken. She must be mad. I said, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nremember me?\xe2\x80\x99 She lifted her slate, and wrote, \xe2\x80\x98I remember you, in a\r\ndead swoon at Windygates House.\xe2\x80\x99 I was quite unaware that she had been\r\npresent when I fainted in the library. The discovery startled me--or\r\nthat dreadful, dead-cold look that she has in her eyes startled me--I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know which. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to her just at first. She wrote on\r\nher slate again--the strangest question--in these words: \xe2\x80\x98I said, at the\r\ntime, brought to it by a man. Did I say true?\xe2\x80\x99 If the question had been\r\nput in the usual way, by any body else, I should have considered it too\r\ninsolent to be noticed. Can you understand my answering it, Sir Patrick?\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t understand it myself, now--and yet I did answer. She forced me\r\nto it with her stony eyes. I said \xe2\x80\x98yes.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid all this take place at the door?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did she let you in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next thing she did was to let me in. She took me by the arm, in\r\na rough way, and drew me inside the door, and shut it. My nerves are\r\nbroken; my courage is gone. I crept with cold when she touched me. She\r\ndropped my arm. I stood like a child, waiting for what it pleased her to\r\nsay or do next. She rested her two hands on her sides, and took a long\r\nlook at me. She made a horrid dumb sound--not as if she was angry;\r\nmore, if such a thing could be, as if she was satisfied--pleased even,\r\nI should have said, if it had been any body but Hester Dethridge. Do you\r\nunderstand it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet. Let me get nearer to understanding it by asking something\r\nbefore you go on. Did she show any attachment to you, when you were both\r\nat Windygates?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the least. She appeared to be incapable of attachment to me, or to\r\nany body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she write any more questions on her slate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. She wrote another question under what she had written just before.\r\nHer mind was still running on my fainting fit, and on the \xe2\x80\x98man\xe2\x80\x99 who had\r\n\xe2\x80\x98brought me to it.\xe2\x80\x99 She held up the slate; and the words were these:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me how he served you, did he knock you down?\xe2\x80\x99 Most people would\r\nhave laughed at the question. _I_ was startled by it. I told her, No.\r\nShe shook her head as if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe me. She wrote on her slate,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are loth to own it when they up with their fists and beat us--ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwe?\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98You are quite wrong.\xe2\x80\x99 She went on obstinately with her\r\nwriting. \xe2\x80\x98Who is the man?\xe2\x80\x99--was her next question. I had control enough\r\nover myself to decline telling her that. She opened the door, and\r\npointed to me to go out. I made a sign entreating her to wait a\r\nlittle. She went back, in her impenetrable way, to the writing on the\r\nslate--still about the \xe2\x80\x98man.\xe2\x80\x99 This time, the question was plainer still.\r\nShe had evidently placed her own interpretation of my appearance at the\r\nhouse. She wrote, \xe2\x80\x98Is it the man who lodges here?\xe2\x80\x99 I saw that she would\r\nclose the door on me if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer. My only chance with her was\r\nto own that she had guessed right. I said \xe2\x80\x98Yes. I want to see him.\xe2\x80\x99 She\r\ntook me by the arm, as roughly as before--and led me into the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI begin to understand her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember hearing, in\r\nmy brother\xe2\x80\x99s time, that she had been brutally ill-used by her husband.\r\nThe association of id eas, even in _her_ confused brain, becomes plain,\r\nif you bear that in mind. What is her last remembrance of you? It is the\r\nremembrance of a fainting woman at Windygates.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe makes you acknowledge that she has guessed right, in guessing that\r\na man was, in some way, answerable for the condition in which she found\r\nyou. A swoon produced by a shock indicted on the mind, is a swoon that\r\nshe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand. She looks back into her own experience, and\r\nassociates it with the exercise of actual physical brutality on the part\r\nof the man. And she sees, in you, a reflection of her own sufferings\r\nand her own case. It\xe2\x80\x99s curious--to a student of human nature. And it\r\nexplains, what is otherwise unintelligible--her overlooking her own\r\ninstructions to the servant, and letting you into the house. What\r\nhappened next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe took me into a room, which I suppose was her own room. She made\r\nsigns, offering me tea. It was done in the strangest way--without the\r\nleast appearance of kindness. After what you have just said to me, I\r\nthink I can in some degree interpret what was going on in her mind.\r\nI believe she felt a hard-hearted interest in seeing a woman whom she\r\nsupposed to be as unfortunate as she had once been herself. I declined\r\ntaking any tea, and tried to return to the subject of what I wanted in\r\nthe house. She paid no heed to me. She pointed round the room; and then\r\ntook me to a window, and pointed round the garden--and then made a sign\r\nindicating herself. \xe2\x80\x98My house; and my garden\xe2\x80\x99--that was what she meant.\r\nThere were four men in the garden--and Geoffrey Delamayn was one of\r\nthem. I made another attempt to tell her that I wanted to speak to him.\r\nBut, no! She had her own idea in her mind. After beckoning to me to\r\nleave the window, she led the way to the fire-place, and showed me a\r\nsheet of paper with writing on it, framed and placed under a glass, and\r\nhung on the wall. She seemed, I thought, to feel some kind of pride in\r\nher framed manuscript. At any rate, she insisted on my reading it. It\r\nwas an extract from a will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe will under which she had inherited the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Her brother\xe2\x80\x99s will. It said, that he regretted, on his death-bed,\r\nhis estrangement from his only sister, dating from the time when she had\r\nmarried in defiance of his wishes and against his advice. As a proof\r\nof his sincere desire to be reconciled with her, before he died, and as\r\nsome compensation for the sufferings that she had endured at the hands\r\nof her deceased husband, he left her an income of two hundred pounds a\r\nyear, together with the use of his house and garden, for her lifetime.\r\nThat, as well as I remember, was the substance of what it said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCreditable to her brother, and creditable to herself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir\r\nPatrick. \xe2\x80\x9cTaking her odd character into consideration, I understand her\r\nliking it to be seen. What puzzles me, is her letting lodgings with an\r\nincome of her own to live on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the very question which I put to her myself. I was obliged\r\nto be cautious, and to begin by asking about the lodgers first--the men\r\nbeing still visible out in the garden, to excuse the inquiry. The rooms\r\nto let in the house had (as I understood her) been taken by a person\r\nacting for Geoffrey Delamayn--his trainer, I presume. He had surprised\r\nHester Dethridge by barely noticing the house, and showing the most\r\nextraordinary interest in the garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is quite intelligible, Miss Silvester. The garden you have\r\ndescribed would be just the place he wanted for the exercises of his\r\nemployer--plenty of space, and well secured from observation by the high\r\nwalls all round. What next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext, I got to the question of why she should let her house in lodgings\r\nat all. When I asked her that, her face turned harder than ever. She\r\nanswered me on her slate in these dismal words: \xe2\x80\x98I have not got a friend\r\nin the world. I dare not live alone.\xe2\x80\x99 There was her reason! Dreary and\r\ndreadful, Sir Patrick, was it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDreary indeed! How did it end? Did you get into the garden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--at the second attempt. She seemed suddenly to change her mind; she\r\nopened the door for me herself. Passing the window of the room in which\r\nI had left her, I looked back. She had taken her place, at a table\r\nbefore the window, apparently watching for what might happen. There was\r\nsomething about her, as her eyes met mine (I can\xe2\x80\x99t say what), which made\r\nme feel uneasy at the time. Adopting your view, I am almost inclined to\r\nthink now, horrid as the idea is, that she had the expectation of seeing\r\nme treated as _she_ had been treated in former days. It was actually a\r\nrelief to me--though I knew I was going to run a serious risk--to lose\r\nsight of her. As I got nearer to the men in the garden, I heard two of\r\nthem talking very earnestly to Geoffrey Delamayn. The fourth person, an\r\nelderly gentleman, stood apart from the rest at some little distance. I\r\nkept as far as I could out of sight, waiting till the talk was over.\r\nIt was impossible for me to help hearing it. The two men were trying\r\nto persuade Geoffrey Delamayn to speak to the elderly gentleman. They\r\npointed to him as a famous medical man. They reiterated over and over\r\nagain, that his opinion was well worth having--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick interrupted her. \xe2\x80\x9cDid they mention his name?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. They called him Mr. Speedwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man himself! This is even more interesting, Miss Silvester, than\r\nyou suppose. I myself heard Mr. Speedwell warn Delamayn that he was in\r\nbroken health, when we were visiting together at Windygates House\r\nlast month. Did he do as the other men wished him? Did he speak to the\r\nsurgeon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. He sulkily refused--he remembered what you remember. He said, \xe2\x80\x98See\r\nthe man who told me I was broken down?--not I!\xe2\x80\x99 After confirming it\r\nwith an oath, he turned away from the others. Unfortunately, he took the\r\ndirection in which I was standing, and discovered me. The bare sight\r\nof me seemed to throw him instantly into a state of frenzy. He--it is\r\nimpossible for me to repeat the language that he used: it is bad enough\r\nto have heard it. I believe, Sir Patrick, but for the two men, who ran\r\nup and laid hold of him, that Hester Dethridge would have seen what she\r\nexpected to see. The change in him was so frightful--even to me, well as\r\nI thought I knew him in his fits of passion--I tremble when I think of\r\nit. One of the men who had restrained him was almost as brutal, in his\r\nway. He declared, in the foulest language, that if Delamayn had a fit,\r\nhe would lose the race, and that I should be answerable for it. But for\r\nMr. Speedwell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I should have done. He came forward\r\ndirectly. \xe2\x80\x98This is no place either for you, or for me,\xe2\x80\x99 he said--and\r\ngave me his arm, and led me back to the house. Hester Dethridge met us\r\nin the passage, and lifted her hand to stop me. Mr. Speedwell asked her\r\nwhat she wanted. She looked at me, and then looked toward the garden,\r\nand made the motion of striking a blow with her clenched fist. For the\r\nfirst time in my experience of her--I hope it was my fancy--I thought I\r\nsaw her smile. Mr. Speedwell took me out. \xe2\x80\x98They are well matched in that\r\nhouse,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98The woman is as complete a savage as the men.\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\ncarriage which I had seen waiting at the door was his. He called it up,\r\nand politely offered me a place in it. I said I would only trespass on\r\nhis kindness as far as to the railway station. While we were talking,\r\nHester Dethridge followed us to the door. She made the same motion again\r\nwith her clenched hand, and looked back toward the garden--and then\r\nlooked at me, and nodded her head, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x98He will do it\r\nyet!\xe2\x80\x99 No words can describe how glad I was to see the last of her. I\r\nhope and trust I shall never set eyes on her again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear how Mr. Speedwell came to be at the house? Had he gone of\r\nhis own accord? or had he been sent for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had been sent for. I ventured to speak to him about the persons whom\r\nI had seen in the garden. Mr. Speedwell explained everything which I was\r\nnot able of myself to understand, in the kindest manner. One of the two\r\nstrange men in the garden was the trainer; the other was a doctor, whom\r\nthe trainer was usually in the habit of consulting. It seems that the\r\nreal reason for their bringing Geof frey Delamayn away from Scotland\r\nwhen they did, was that the trainer was uneasy, and wanted to be near\r\nLondon for medical advice. The doctor, on being consulted, owned that he\r\nwas at a loss to understand the symptoms which he was asked to treat.\r\nHe had himself fetched the great surgeon to Fulham, that morning. Mr.\r\nSpeedwell abstained from mentioning that he had foreseen what would\r\nhappen, at Windygates. All he said was, \xe2\x80\x98I had met Mr. Delamayn in\r\nsociety, and I felt interest enough in the case to pay him a visit--with\r\nwhat result, you have seen yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he tell you any thing about Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s health?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said that he had questioned the doctor on the way to Fulham, and\r\nthat some of the patient\xe2\x80\x99s symptoms indicated serious mischief. What the\r\nsymptoms were I did not hear. Mr. Speedwell only spoke of changes for\r\nthe worse in him which a woman would be likely to understand. At one\r\ntime, he would be so dull and heedless that nothing could rouse him. At\r\nanother, he flew into the most terrible passions without any apparent\r\ncause. The trainer had found it almost impossible (in Scotland) to keep\r\nhim to the right diet; and the doctor had only sanctioned taking\r\nthe house at Fulham, after being first satisfied, not only of the\r\nconvenience of the garden, but also that Hester Dethridge could be\r\nthoroughly trusted as a cook. With her help, they had placed him on an\r\nentirely new diet. But they had found an unexpected difficulty even in\r\ndoing that. When the trainer took him to the new lodgings, it turned\r\nout that he had seen Hester Dethridge at Windygates, and had taken\r\nthe strongest prejudice against her. On seeing her again at Fulham, he\r\nappeared to be absolutely terrified.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTerrified? Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody knows why. The trainer and the doctor together could only\r\nprevent his leaving the house, by threatening to throw up the\r\nresponsibility of preparing him for the race, unless he instantly\r\ncontrolled himself, and behaved like a man instead of a child. Since\r\nthat time, he has become reconciled, little by little, to his new\r\nabode--partly through Hester Dethridge\xe2\x80\x99s caution in keeping herself\r\nalways out of his way; and partly through his own appreciation of the\r\nchange in his diet, which Hester\xe2\x80\x99s skill in cookery has enabled the\r\ndoctor to make. Mr. Speedwell mentioned some things which I have\r\nforgotten. I can only repeat, Sir Patrick, the result at which he has\r\narrived in his own mind. Coming from a man of his authority, the opinion\r\nseems to me to be startling in the last degree. If Geoffrey Delamayn\r\nruns in the race on Thursday next, he will do it at the risk of his\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the risk of dying on the ground?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s face became thoughtful. He waited a little before he spoke\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have not wasted our time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cin dwelling on what happened\r\nduring your visit to Fulham. The possibility of this man\xe2\x80\x99s death\r\nsuggests to my mind serious matter for consideration. It is very\r\ndesirable, in the interests of my niece and her husband, that I should\r\nbe able to foresee, if I can, how a fatal result of the race might\r\naffect the inquiry which is to be held on Saturday next. I believe you\r\nmay be able to help me in this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have only to tell me how, Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may count on your being present on Saturday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou thoroughly understand that, in meeting Blanche, you will meet a\r\nperson estranged from you, for the present--a friend and sister who has\r\nceased (under Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s influence mainly) to feel as a friend and\r\nsister toward you now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not quite unprepared, Sir Patrick, to hear that Blanche had\r\nmisjudged me. When I wrote my letter to Mr. Brinkworth, I warned him\r\nas delicately as I could, that his wife\xe2\x80\x99s jealousy might be very easily\r\nroused. You may rely on my self-restraint, no matter how hardly it may\r\nbe tried. Nothing that Blanche can say or do will alter my grateful\r\nremembrance of the past. While I live, I love her. Let that assurance\r\nquiet any little anxiety that you may have felt as to my conduct--and\r\ntell me how I can serve those interests which I have at heart as well as\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can serve them, Miss Silvester, in this way. You can make me\r\nacquainted with the position in which you stood toward Delamayn at the\r\ntime when you went to the Craig Fernie inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut any questions to me that you think right, Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will begin by recalling something which you have already told me.\r\nDelamayn has promised you marriage--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver and over again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn words?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn writing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see what I am coming to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHardly yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou referred, when we first met in this room, to a letter which you\r\nrecovered from Bishopriggs, at Perth. I have ascertained from Arnold\r\nBrinkworth that the sheet of note-paper stolen from you contained two\r\nletters. One was written by you to Delamayn--the other was written by\r\nDelamayn to you. The substance of this last Arnold remembered. Your\r\nletter he had not read. It is of the utmost importance, Miss Silvester,\r\nto let me see that correspondence before we part to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne made no answer. She sat with her clasped hands on her lap. Her eyes\r\nlooked uneasily away from Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s face, for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it not be enough,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, after an interval, \xe2\x80\x9cif I tell you\r\nthe substance of my letter, without showing it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will _not_ be enough,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sir Patrick, in the plainest manner.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hinted--if you remember--at the propriety of my seeing the letter,\r\nwhen you first mentioned it, and I observed that you purposely abstained\r\nfrom understanding me, I am grieved to put you, on this occasion, to a\r\npainful test. But if you _are_ to help me at this serious crisis, I have\r\nshown you the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne rose from her chair, and answered by putting the letter into Sir\r\nPatrick\xe2\x80\x99s hands. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember what he has done, since I wrote that,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd try to excuse me, if I own that I am ashamed to show it to\r\nyou now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words she walked aside to the window. She stood there, with\r\nher hand pressed on her breast, looking out absently on the murky London\r\nview of house roof and chimney, while Sir Patrick opened the letter.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to the right appreciation of events, that other\r\neyes besides Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s should follow the brief course of the\r\ncorrespondence in this place.\r\n\r\n1. _From Anne Silvester to Geoffrey Delamayn._\r\n\r\nWINDYGATES HOUSE. _August_ 19, 1868.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGEOFFREY DELAMAYN,--I have waited in the hope that you would ride over\r\nfrom your brother\xe2\x80\x99s place, and see me--and I have waited in vain. Your\r\nconduct to me is cruelty itself; I will bear it no longer. Consider! in\r\nyour own interests, consider--before you drive the miserable woman who\r\nhas trusted you to despair. You have promised me marriage by all that is\r\nsacred. I claim your promise. I insist on nothing less than to be\r\nwhat you vowed I should be--what I have waited all this weary time to\r\nbe--what I _am,_ in the sight of Heaven, your wedded wife. Lady Lundie\r\ngives a lawn-party here on the 14th. I know you have been asked. I\r\nexpect you to accept her invitation. If I don\xe2\x80\x99t see you, I won\xe2\x80\x99t answer\r\nfor what may happen. My mind is made up to endure this suspense no\r\nlonger. Oh, Geoffrey, remember the past! Be faithful--be just--to your\r\nloving wife,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cANNE SILVESTER.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n2. _From Geoffrey Delamayn to Anne Silvester._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR ANNE,--Just called to London to my father. They have telegraphed\r\nhim in a bad way. Stop where you are, and I will write you. Trust the\r\nbearer. Upon my soul, I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep my promise. Your loving husband that is\r\nto be,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGEOFFREY DELAMAYN.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWINDYGATES HOUSE _Augt._ 14, 4 P. M.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a mortal hurry. The train starts 4.30.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Patrick read the correspondence with breathless attention to the\r\nend. At the last lines of the last letter he did what he had not done\r\nfor twenty years past--he sprang to his feet at a bound, and he crossed\r\na room without the help of his ivory cane.\r\n\r\nAnne started; and turning round from the window, looked at him in silent\r\nsurprise. He was under the influence of strong emotion; his face, his\r\nvoice, his manner, all showed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long had you been in Scotland, when you wrote this?\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed to\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s letter as he asked the question, put ting it so eagerly that he\r\nstammered over the first words. \xe2\x80\x9cMore than three weeks?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with\r\nhis bright black eyes fixed in absorbing interest on her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am certain of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can refer to persons who have seen you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEasily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned the sheet of note-paper, and pointed to Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s penciled\r\nletter on the fourth page.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long had _he_ been in Scotland, when _he_ wrote this? More than\r\nthree weeks, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne considered for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, be careful!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\ndepends on this, If your memory is not clear about it, say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy memory was confused for a moment. It is clear again now. He had been\r\nat his brother\xe2\x80\x99s in Perthshire three weeks before he wrote that. And\r\nbefore he went to Swanhaven, he spent three or four days in the valley\r\nof the Esk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know of any one who saw him in the valley of the Esk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know of a person who took a note to him, from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA person easily found?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite easily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick laid aside the letter, and seized in ungovernable agitation\r\non both her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole conspiracy against Arnold Brinkworth\r\nand you falls to the ground before that correspondence. When you and he\r\nmet at the inn--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused, and looked at her. Her hands were beginning to tremble in\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you and Arnold Brinkworth met at the inn,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe law of\r\nScotland had made you a married woman. On the day, and at the hour,\r\nwhen he wrote those lines at the back of your letter to him, you were\r\n_Geoffrey Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s wedded wife!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and looked at her again.\r\n\r\nWithout a word in reply, without the slightest movement in her from head\r\nto foot, she looked back at him. The blank stillness of horror was in\r\nher face. The deadly cold of horror was in her hands.\r\n\r\nIn silence, on his side, Sir Patrick drew back a step, with a faint\r\nreflection of _her_ dismay in his face. Married--to the villain who had\r\nnot hesitated to calumniate the woman whom he had ruined, and then to\r\ncast her helpless on the world. Married--to the traitor who had not\r\nshrunk from betraying Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s trust in him, and desolating Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhome. Married--to the ruffian who would have struck her that morning, if\r\nthe hands of his own friends had not held him back. And Sir Patrick had\r\nnever thought of it! Absorbed in the one idea of Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s future, he\r\nhad never thought of it, till that horror-stricken face looked at him,\r\nand said, Think of _my_ future, too!\r\n\r\nHe came back to her. He took her cold hand once more in his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor thinking first of Blanche.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s name seemed to rouse her. The life came back to her face; the\r\ntender brightness began to shine again in her eyes. He saw that he might\r\nventure to speak more plainly still: he went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see the dreadful sacrifice as _you_ see it. I ask myself, have I any\r\nright, has Blanche any right--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped him by a faint pressure of his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, softly, \xe2\x80\x9cif Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s happiness depends on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRTEENTH SCENE.--FULHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FORTY-FIFTH.\r\n\r\nTHE FOOT-RACE.\r\n\r\nA SOLITARY foreigner, drifting about London, drifted toward Fulham on\r\nthe day of the Foot-Race.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, he found himself involved in the current of a throng\r\nof impetuous English people, all flowing together toward one given\r\npoint, and all decorated alike with colors of two prevailing hues--pink\r\nand yellow. He drifted along with the stream of passengers on the\r\npavement (accompanied by a stream of carriages in the road) until they\r\nstopped with one accord at a gate--and paid admission money to a man in\r\noffice--and poured into a great open space of ground which looked like\r\nan uncultivated garden.\r\n\r\nArrived here, the foreign visitor opened his eyes in wonder at the scene\r\nrevealed to view. He observed thousands of people assembled, composed\r\nalmost exclusively of the middle and upper classes of society. They\r\nwere congregated round a vast inclosure; they were elevated on\r\namphitheatrical wooden stands, and they were perched on the roofs of\r\nhorseless carriages, drawn up in rows. From this congregation there rose\r\nsuch a roar of eager voices as he had never heard yet from any assembled\r\nmultitude in these islands. Predominating among the cries, he detected\r\none everlasting question. It began with, \xe2\x80\x9cWho backs--?\xe2\x80\x9d and it ended in\r\nthe alternate pronouncing of two British names unintelligible to foreign\r\nears. Seeing these extraordinary sights, and hearing these stirring\r\nsounds, he applied to a policeman on duty; and said, in his best\r\nproducible English, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, Sir, what is this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe policeman answered, \xe2\x80\x9cNorth against South--Sports.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe foreigner was informed, but not satisfied. He pointed all round the\r\nassembly with a circular sweep of his hand; and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe policeman declined to waste words on a man who could ask such a\r\nquestion as that. He lifted a large purple forefinger, with a broad\r\nwhite nail at the end of it, and pointed gravely to a printed Bill,\r\nposted on the wall behind him. The drifting foreigner drifted to the\r\nBill.\r\n\r\nAfter reading it carefully, from top to bottom, he consulted a polite\r\nprivate individual near at hand, who proved to be far more communicative\r\nthan the policeman. The result on his mind, as a person not thoroughly\r\nawakened to the enormous national importance of Athletic Sports, was\r\nmuch as follows:\r\n\r\nThe color of North is pink. The color of South is yellow. North produces\r\nfourteen pink men, and South produces thirteen yellow men. The meeting\r\nof pink and yellow is a solemnity. The solemnity takes its rise in\r\nan indomitable national passion for hardening the arms and legs, by\r\nthrowing hammers and cricket-balls with the first, and running and\r\njumping with the second. The object in view is to do this in public\r\nrivalry. The ends arrived at are (physically) an excessive development\r\nof the muscles, purchased at the expense of an excessive strain on the\r\nheart and the lungs--(morally), glory; conferred at the moment by the\r\npublic applause; confirmed the next day by a report in the newspapers.\r\nAny person who presumes to see any physical evil involved in these\r\nexercises to the men who practice them, or any moral obstruction in\r\nthe exhibition itself to those civilizing influences on which the true\r\ngreatness of all nations depends, is a person without a biceps, who is\r\nsimply incomprehensible. Muscular England develops itself, and takes no\r\nnotice of him.\r\n\r\nThe foreigner mixed with the assembly, and looked more closely at the\r\nsocial spectacle around him.\r\n\r\nHe had met with these people before. He had seen them (for instance) at\r\nthe theatre, and observed their manners and customs with considerable\r\ncuriosity and surprise. When the curtain was down, they were so little\r\ninterested in what they had come to see, that they had hardly spirit\r\nenough to speak to each other between the acts. When the curtain was up,\r\nif the play made any appeal to their sympathy with any of the higher and\r\nnobler emotions of humanity, they received it as something wearisome, or\r\nsneered at it as something absurd. The public feeling of the countrymen\r\nof Shakespeare, so far as they represented it, recognized but two duties\r\nin the dramatist--the duty of making them laugh, and the duty of getting\r\nit over soon. The two great merits of a stage proprietor, in England\r\n(judging by the rare applause of his cultivated customers), consisted\r\nin spending plenty of money on his scenery, and in hiring plenty of\r\nbrazen-faced women to exhibit their bosoms and their legs. Not at\r\ntheatres only; but among other gatherings, in other places, the\r\nforeigner had noticed the same stolid languor where any effort was\r\nexacted from genteel English brains, and the same stupid contempt where\r\nany appeal was made to genteel English hearts. Preserve us from enjoying\r\nany thing but jokes and scandal! Preserve us from respecting any thing\r\nbut rank and money! There were the social aspirations of these insular\r\nladies and gentlemen, as expressed under other circumstances, and as\r\nbetrayed amidst other scenes. Here, all was changed. Here was the strong\r\nfeeling, the breathless interest, the hearty enthusiasm, not visible\r\nelsewhere. Here were the superb gentlemen who were too weary to speak,\r\nwhen an Art was addressing them, shouting themselves hoarse with burst\r\non burst of genuine applause. Here were the fine ladies who yawned\r\nbehind their fans, at the bare idea of being called on to think or\r\nto feel, waving their handkerchiefs in honest delight, and actually\r\nflushing with excitement through their powder and their paint. And all\r\nfor what? All for running and jumping--all for throwing hammers and\r\nballs.\r\n\r\nThe foreigner looked at it, and tried, as a citizen of a civilized\r\ncountry, to understand it. He was still trying--when there occurred a\r\npause in the performances.\r\n\r\nCertain hurdles, which had served to exhibit the present satisfactory\r\nstate of civilization (in jumping) among the upper classes, were\r\nremoved. The privileged persons who had duties to perform within the\r\ninclosure, looked all round it; and disappeared one after another. A\r\ngreat hush of expectation pervaded the whole assembly. Something of no\r\ncommon interest and importance was evidently about to take place. On a\r\nsudden, the silence was broken by a roar of cheering from the mob in\r\nthe road outside the grounds. People looked at each other excitedly,\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cOne of them has come.\xe2\x80\x9d The silence prevailed again--and was\r\na second time broken by another roar of applause. People nodded to each\r\nother with an air of relief and said, \xe2\x80\x9cBoth of them have come.\xe2\x80\x9d Then the\r\ngreat hush fell on the crowd once more, and all eyes looked toward one\r\nparticular point of the ground, occupied by a little wooden pavilion,\r\nwith the blinds down over the open windows, and the door closed.\r\n\r\nThe foreigner was deeply impressed by the silent expectation of the\r\ngreat throng about him. He felt his own sympathies stirred, without\r\nknowing why. He believed himself to be on the point of understanding the\r\nEnglish people.\r\n\r\nSome ceremony of grave importance was evidently in preparation. Was a\r\ngreat orator going to address the assembly? Was a glorious anniversary\r\nto be commemorated? Was a religious service to be performed? He looked\r\nround him to apply for information once more. Two gentlemen--who\r\ncontrasted favorably, so far as refinement of manner was concerned, with\r\nmost of the spectators present--were slowly making their way, at that\r\nmoment, through the crowd near him. He respectfully asked what national\r\nsolemnity was now about to take place. They informed him that a pair\r\nof strong young men were going to run round the inclosure for a given\r\nnumber of turns, with the object of ascertaining which could run the\r\nfastest of the two.\r\n\r\nThe foreigner lifted his hands and eyes to heaven. Oh, multifarious\r\nProvidence! who would have suspected that the infinite diversities of\r\nthy creation included such beings as these! With that aspiration, he\r\nturned his back on the race-course, and left the place.\r\n\r\nOn his way out of the grounds he had occasion to use his handkerchief,\r\nand found that it was gone. He felt next for his purse. His purse was\r\nmissing too. When he was back again in his own country, intelligent\r\ninquiries were addressed to him on the subject of England. He had but\r\none reply to give. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole nation is a mystery to me. Of all the\r\nEnglish people I only understand the English thieves!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the two gentlemen, making their way through the crowd,\r\nreached a wicket-gate in the fence which surrounded the inclosure.\r\n\r\nPresenting a written order to the policeman in charge of the gate, they\r\nwere forthwith admitted within the sacred precincts The closely packed\r\nspectators, regarding them with mixed feelings of envy and curiosity,\r\nwondered who they might be. Were they referees appointed to act at\r\nthe coming race? or reporters for the newspapers? or commissioners of\r\npolice? They were neither the one nor the other. They were only Mr.\r\nSpeedwell, the surgeon, and Sir Patrick Lundie.\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen walked into the centre of the inclosure, and looked\r\nround them.\r\n\r\nThe grass on which they were standing was girdled by a broad smooth\r\npath, composed of finely-sifted ashes and sand--and this again was\r\nsurrounded by the fence and by the spectators ranked behind it. Above\r\nthe lines thus formed rose on one side the amphitheatres with their\r\ntiers of crowded benches, and on the other the long rows of carriages\r\nwith the sight-seers inside and out. The evening sun was shining\r\nbrightly, the light and shade lay together in grand masses, the varied\r\ncolors of objects blended softly one with the other. It was a splendid\r\nand an inspiriting scene.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick turned from the rows of eager faces all round him to his\r\nfriend the surgeon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there one person to be found in this vast crowd,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwho has\r\ncome to see the race with the doubt in his mind which has brought _us_\r\nto see it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Speedwell shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cNot one of them knows or cares what the\r\nstruggle may cost the men who engage in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick looked round him again. \xe2\x80\x9cI almost wish I had not come to see\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf this wretched man--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe surgeon interposed. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t dwell needlessly, Sir Patrick, on the\r\ngloomy view,\xe2\x80\x9d he rejoined. \xe2\x80\x9cThe opinion I have formed has, thus far, no\r\npositive grounds to rest on. I am guessing rightly, as I believe, but at\r\nthe same time I am guessing in the dark. Appearances _may_ have misled\r\nme. There may be reserves of vital force in Mr. Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s constitution\r\nwhich I don\xe2\x80\x99t suspect. I am here to learn a lesson--not to see a\r\nprediction fulfilled. I know his health is broken, and I believe he\r\nis going to run this race at his own proper peril. Don\xe2\x80\x99t feel too sure\r\nbeforehand of the event. The event may prove me to be wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the moment Sir Patrick dropped the subject. He was not in his usual\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nSince his interview with Anne had satisfied him that she was Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlawful wife, the conviction had inevitably forced itself on his mind\r\nthat the one possible chance for her in the future, was the chance of\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s death. Horrible as it was to him, he had been possessed by\r\nthat one idea--go where he might, do what he might, struggle as he might\r\nto force his thoughts in other directions. He looked round the broad\r\nashen path on which the race was to be run, conscious that he had a\r\nsecret interest in it which it was unutterably repugnant to him to feel.\r\nHe tried to resume the conversation with his friend, and to lead it to\r\nother topics. The effort was useless. In despite of himself, he returned\r\nto the one fatal subject of the struggle that was now close at hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many times must they go round this inclosure,\xe2\x80\x9d he inquired, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore\r\nthe race is ended?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Speedwell turned toward a gentleman who was approaching them at the\r\nmoment. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is somebody coming who can tell us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is one of my patients.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the two runners he is the most important personage on the ground.\r\nHe is the final authority--the umpire of the race.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe person thus described was a middle-aged man, with a prematurely\r\nwrinkled face, with prematurely white hair and with something of a\r\nmilitary look about him--brief in speech, and quick in manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe path measures four hundred and forty yards round,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when\r\nthe surgeon had repeated Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s question to him. \xe2\x80\x9cIn plainer\r\nwords, and not to put you to your arithmetic once round it is a quarter\r\nof a mile. Each round is called a \xe2\x80\x98Lap.\xe2\x80\x99 The men must run sixteen Laps\r\nto finish the race. Not to put you to your arithmetic again, they must\r\nrun four miles--the longest race of this kind which it is customary to\r\nattempt at Sports like these.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProfessional pedestrians exceed that limit, do they not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsiderably--on certain occasions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they a long-lived race?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFar from it. They are exceptions when they live to be old men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Speedwell looked at Sir Patrick. Sir Patrick put a question to the\r\numpire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have just told us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the two young men who appear\r\nto-day are going to run the longest distance yet attempted in their\r\nexperience. Is it generally thought, by persons who understand such\r\nthings, that they are both fit to bear the exertion demanded of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can judge for yourself, Sir. Here is one of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pointed toward the pavilion. At the same moment there rose a mighty\r\nclapping of hands from the great throng of spectators. Fleetwood,\r\nchampion of the North, decorated in his pink colors, descended the\r\npavilion steps and walked into the arena.\r\n\r\nYoung, lithe, and elegant, with supple strength expressed in every\r\nmovement of his limbs, with a bright smile on his resolute young face,\r\nthe man of the north won the women\xe2\x80\x99s hearts at starting. The murmur\r\nof eager talk rose among them on all sides. The men were\r\nquieter--especially the men who understood the subject. It was a serious\r\nquestion with these experts whether Fleetwood was not \xe2\x80\x9ca little too\r\nfine.\xe2\x80\x9d Superbly trained, it was admitted--but, possibly, a little\r\nover-trained for a four-mile race.\r\n\r\nThe northern hero was followed into the inclosure by his friends and\r\nbackers, and by his trainer. This last carried a tin can in his hand.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCold water,\xe2\x80\x9d the umpire explained. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he gets exhausted, his trainer\r\nwill pick him up with a dash of it as he goes by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA new burst of hand-clapping rattled all round the arena. Delamayn,\r\nchampion of the South, decorated in his yellow colors, presented himself\r\nto the public view.\r\n\r\nThe immense hum of voices rose louder and louder as he walked into the\r\ncentre of the great green space. Surprise at the extraordinary contrast\r\nbetween the two men was the prevalent emotion of the moment. Geoffrey\r\nwas more than a head taller than his antagonist, and broader in full\r\nproportion. The women who had been charmed with the easy gait and\r\nconfident smile of Fleetwood, were all more or less painfully impressed\r\nby the sullen strength of the southern man, as he passed before them\r\nslowly, with his head down and his brows knit, deaf to the applause\r\nshowered on him, reckless of the eyes that looked at him; speaking to\r\nnobody; concentrated in himself; biding his time. He held the men who\r\nunderstood the subject breathless with interest. There it was! the\r\nfamous \xe2\x80\x9cstaying power\xe2\x80\x9d that was to endure in the last terrible half-mile\r\nof the race, when the nimble and jaunty Fleetwood was run off his legs.\r\nWhispers had been spread abroad hinting at something which had gone\r\nwrong with Delamayn in his training. And now that all eyes could judge\r\nhim, his appearance suggested criticism in some quarters. It was exactly\r\nthe opposite of the criticism passed on his antagonist. The doubt as to\r\nDelamayn was whether he had been sufficiently trained. Still the\r\nsolid strength of the man, the slow, panther-like smoothness of his\r\nmovements--and, above all, his great reputation in the world of\r\nmuscle and sport--had their effect. The betting which, with occasional\r\nfluctuations, had held steadily in his favor thus far, held, now that he\r\nwas publicly seen, steadily in his favor still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFleetwood for shorter distances, if you like; but Delamayn for a\r\nfour-mile race.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think he sees us?\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Sir Patrick to the surgeon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe sees nobody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you judge of the condition he is in, at this distance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has twice the muscular strength of the other man. His trunk and\r\nlimbs are magnificent. It is useless to ask me more than that about his\r\ncondition. We are too far from him to see his face plainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conversation among the audience began to flag again; and the silent\r\nexpectation set in among them once more. One by one, the different\r\npersons officially connected with the race gathered together on the\r\ngrass. The trainer Perry was among them, with his can of water in his\r\nhand, in anxious whispering conversation with his principal--giving him\r\nthe last words of advice before the start. The trainer\xe2\x80\x99s doctor, leaving\r\nthem together, came up to pay his respects to his illustrious colleague.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow has he got on since I was at Fulham?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Speedwell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst-rate, Sir! It was one of his bad days when you saw him. He has\r\ndone wonders in the last eight-and-forty hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he going to win the race?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPrivately the doctor had done what Perry had done before him--he had\r\nbacked Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s antagonist. Publicly he was true to his colors. He\r\ncast a disparaging look at Fleetwood--and answered Yes, without the\r\nslightest hesitation.\r\n\r\nAt that point, the conversation was suspended by a sudden movement in\r\nthe inclosure. The runners were on their way to the starting-place. The\r\nmoment of the race had come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShoulder to shoulder, the two men waited--each with his foot touching\r\nthe mark. The firing of a pistol gave the signal for the start. At the\r\ninstant when the report sounded they were off.\r\n\r\nFleetwood at once took the lead, Delamayn following, at from two to\r\nthree yards behind him. In that order they ran the first round, the\r\nsecond, and the third--both reserving their strength; both watched with\r\nbreathless interest by every soul in the place. The trainers, with their\r\ncans in their hands, ran backward and forward over the grass, meeting\r\ntheir men at certain points, and eying them narrowly, in silence. The\r\nofficial persons stood together in a group; their eyes following the\r\nrunners round and round with the closest attention. The trainer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoctor, still attached to his illustrious colleague, offered the\r\nnecessary explanations to Mr. Speedwell and his friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing much to see for the first mile, Sir, except the \xe2\x80\x98style\xe2\x80\x99 of the\r\ntwo men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean they are not really exerting themselves yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Getting their wind, and feeling their legs. Pretty runner,\r\nFleetwood--if you notice Sir? Gets his legs a trifle better in front,\r\nand hardly lifts his heels quite so high as our man. His action\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nbest of the two; I grant that. But just look, as they come by, which\r\nkeeps the straightest line. There\xe2\x80\x99s where Delamayn has him! It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nsteadier, stronger, truer pace; and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see it tell when they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nhalf-way through.\xe2\x80\x9d So, for the first three rounds, the doctor expatiated\r\non the two contrasted \xe2\x80\x9cstyles\xe2\x80\x9d--in terms mercifully adapted to the\r\ncomprehension of persons unacquainted with the language of the running\r\nring.\r\n\r\nAt the fourth round--in other words, at the round which completed the\r\nfirst mile, the first change in the relative position of the runners\r\noccurred. Delamayn suddenly dashed to the front. Fleetwood smiled as the\r\nother passed him. Delamayn held the lead till they were half way through\r\nthe fifth round--when Fleetwood, at a hint from his trainer, forced the\r\npace. He lightly passed Delamayn in an instant; and led again to the\r\ncompletion of the sixth round.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the seventh, Delamayn forced the pace on his side. For\r\na few moments, they ran exactly abreast. Then Delamayn drew away inch\r\nby inch; and recovered the lead. The first burst of applause (led by the\r\nsouth) rang out, as the big man beat Fleetwood at his own tactics, and\r\nheaded him at the critical moment when the race was nearly half run.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt begins to look as if Delamayn _was_ going to win!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\nThe trainer\xe2\x80\x99s doctor forgot himself. Infected by the rising excitement\r\nof every body about him, he let out the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cFleetwood has got directions to let him\r\npass--Fleetwood is waiting to see what he can do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCunning, you see, Sir Patrick, is one of the elements in a manly\r\nsport,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Speedwell, quietly.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the seventh round, Fleetwood proved the doctor to be\r\nright. He shot past Delamayn like an arrow from a bow. At the end of the\r\neight round, he was leading by two yards. Half the race had then been\r\nrun. Time, ten minutes and thirty-three seconds.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the ninth round, the pace slackened a little; and\r\nDelamayn was in front again. He kept ahead, until the opening of the\r\neleventh round. At that point, Fleetwood flung up one hand in the air\r\nwith a gesture of triumph; and bounded past Delamayn with a shout of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHooray for the North!\xe2\x80\x9d The shout was echoed by the spectators. In\r\nproportion as the exertion began to tell upon the men, so the excitement\r\nsteadily rose among the people looking at them.\r\n\r\nAt the twelfth round, Fleetwood was leading by six yards. Cries of\r\ntriumph rose among the adherents of the north, met by counter-cries of\r\ndefiance from the south. At the next turn Delamayn resolutely lessened\r\nthe distance between his antagonist and himself. At the opening of the\r\nfourteenth round, they were coming sid e by side. A few yards more, and\r\nDelamayn was in front again, amidst a roar of applause from the whole\r\npublic voice. Yet a few yards further, and Fleetwood neared him, passed\r\nhim, dropped behind again, led again, and was passed again at the end\r\nof the round. The excitement rose to its highest pitch, as the\r\nrunners--gasping for breath; with dark flushed faces, and heaving\r\nbreasts--alternately passed and repassed each other. Oaths were heard\r\nnow as well as cheers. Women turned pale and men set their teeth, as the\r\nlast round but one began.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of it, Delamayn was still in advance. Before six yards\r\nmore had been covered, Fleetwood betrayed the purpose of his running in\r\nthe previous round, and electrified the whole assembly, by dashing past\r\nhis antagonist--for the first time in the race at the top of his speed.\r\nEvery body present could see, now, that Delamayn had been allowed to\r\nlead on sufferance--had been dextrously drawn on to put out his whole\r\npower--and had then, and not till then, been seriously deprived of the\r\nlead. He made another effort, with a desperate resolution that roused\r\nthe public enthusiasm to frenzy. While the voices were roaring; while\r\nthe hats and handkerchiefs were waving round the course; while\r\nthe actual event of the race was, for one supreme moment, still in\r\ndoubt--Mr. Speedwell caught Sir Patrick by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrepare yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the words passed his lips, Delamayn swerved on the path. His trainer\r\ndashed water over him. He rallied, and ran another step or two--swerved\r\nagain--staggered--lifted his arm to his mouth with a hoarse cry of\r\nrage--fastened his own teeth in his flesh like a wild beast--and fell\r\nsenseless on the course.\r\n\r\nA Babel of sounds arose. The cries of alarm in some places, mingling\r\nwith the shouts of triumph from the backers of Fleetwood in others--as\r\ntheir man ran lightly on to win the now uncontested race. Not the\r\ninclosure only, but the course itself was invaded by the crowd. In the\r\nmidst of the tumult the fallen man was drawn on to the grass--with Mr.\r\nSpeedwell and the trainer\xe2\x80\x99s doctor in attendance on him. At the terrible\r\nmoment when the surgeon laid his hand on the heart, Fleetwood passed the\r\nspot--a passage being forced for him through the people by his friends\r\nand the police--running the sixteenth and last round of the race.\r\n\r\nHad the beaten man fainted under it, or had he died under it? Every body\r\nwaited, with their eyes riveted on the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\nThe surgeon looked up from him, and called for water to throw over his\r\nface, for brandy to put into his mouth. He was coming to life again--he\r\nhad survived the race. The last shout of applause which hailed\r\nFleetwood\xe2\x80\x99s victory rang out as they lifted him from the ground to carry\r\nhim to the pavilion. Sir Patrick (admitted at Mr. Speedwell\xe2\x80\x99s request)\r\nwas the one stranger allowed to pass the door. At the moment when he was\r\nascending the steps, some one touched his arm. It was Captain Newenden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo the doctors answer for his life?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t get my\r\nniece to leave the ground till she is satisfied of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Speedwell heard the question and replied to it briefly from the top\r\nof the pavilion steps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the present--yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe captain thanked him, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThey entered the pavilion. The necessary restorative measures were\r\ntaken under Mr. Speedwell\xe2\x80\x99s directions. There the conquered athlete lay:\r\noutwardly an inert mass of strength, formidable to look at, even in its\r\nfall; inwardly, a weaker creature, in all that constitutes vital\r\nforce, than the fly that buzzed on the window-pane. By slow degrees the\r\nfluttering life came back. The sun was setting; and the evening light\r\nwas beginning to fail. Mr. Speedwell beckoned to Perry to follow him\r\ninto an unoccupied corner of the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn half an hour or less he will be well enough to be taken home. Where\r\nare his friends? He has a brother--hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis brother\xe2\x80\x99s in Scotland, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerry scratched his head. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom all I hear, Sir, he and his father don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nagree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Speedwell applied to Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know any thing of his family affairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery little. I believe what the man has told you to be the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs his mother living?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will write to her myself. In the mean time, somebody must take him\r\nhome. He has plenty of friends here. Where are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked out of the window as he spoke. A throng of people had gathered\r\nround the pavilion, waiting to hear the latest news. Mr. Speedwell\r\ndirected Perry to go out and search among them for any friends of his\r\nemployer whom he might know by sight. Perry hesitated, and scratched his\r\nhead for the second time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you waiting for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the surgeon, sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know his\r\nfriends by sight, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I shall find them outside,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey backed him heavily, Sir--and they have all lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDeaf to this unanswerable reason for the absence of friends, Mr.\r\nSpeedwell insisted on sending Perry out to search among the persons\r\nwho composed the crowd. The trainer returned with his report. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were\r\nright, Sir. There are some of his friends outside. They want to see\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet two or three of them in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThree came in. They stared at him. They uttered brief expressions of\r\npity in slang. They said to Mr. Speedwell, \xe2\x80\x9cWe wanted to see him. What\r\nis it--eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a break-down in his health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad training?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAthletic Sports.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Thank you. Good-evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Speedwell\xe2\x80\x99s answer drove them out like a flock of sheep before a\r\ndog. There was not even time to put the question to them as to who was\r\nto take him home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll look after him, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Perry. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can trust me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go too,\xe2\x80\x9d added the trainer\xe2\x80\x99s doctor; \xe2\x80\x9cand see him littered down\r\nfor the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(The only two men who had \xe2\x80\x9chedged\xe2\x80\x9d their bets, by privately backing his\r\nopponent, were also the only two men who volunteered to take him home!)\r\n\r\nThey went back to the sofa on which he was lying. His bloodshot\r\neyes were rolling heavily and vacantly about him, on the search for\r\nsomething. They rested on the doctor--and looked away again. They turned\r\nto Mr. Speedwell--and stopped, riveted on his face. The surgeon bent\r\nover him, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered with a thick accent and laboring breath--uttering a word at\r\na time: \xe2\x80\x9cShall--I--die?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked round him again. This time his eyes rested on the trainer.\r\nPerry came forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do for you, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reply came slowly as before. \xe2\x80\x9cMy--coat--pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis one, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe trainer felt in the pocket, and produced a betting-book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s to be done with this. Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe trainer held the book before him; open at the last two pages on\r\nwhich entries had been made. He rolled his head impatiently from side to\r\nside of the sofa pillow. It was plain that he was not yet sufficiently\r\nrecovered to be able to read what he had written.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I read for you, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe trainer read three entries, one after another, without result; they\r\nhad all been honestly settled. At the fourth the prostrate man said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d This was the first of the entries which still depended on a\r\nfuture event. It recorded the wager laid at Windygates, when Geoffrey\r\nhad backed himself (in defiance of the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s opinion) to row in the\r\nUniversity boat-race next spring--and had forced Arnold Brinkworth to\r\nbet against him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Sir? What\xe2\x80\x99s to be done about this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe collected his strength for the effort; and answered by a word at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite--brother--Julius. Pay--Arnold--wins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis lifted hand, solemnly emphasizing what he said, dropped at his side.\r\nHe closed his eyes; and fell into a heavy stertorous sleep. Give him his\r\ndue. Scoundrel as he was, give him his due. The awful moment, when his\r\nlife was trembling in the balance, found him true to the last living\r\nfaith left among the men of his tribe and time--the faith of the\r\nbetting-book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Patrick and Mr. Speedwell quitted the race-ground together; Geoffrey\r\nhaving been previously removed to his lodgings hard by. They met Arnold\r\nBrinkworth at the gate. He had, by his own desire, kept out of view\r\namong the crowd; and he decided on walking back by himself. The\r\nseparation from Blanche had changed him in all his habits. He asked but\r\ntwo favors during the interval which was to elapse before he saw his\r\nwife again--to be allowed to bear it in his own way, and to be left\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nRelieved of the oppression which had kept him silent while the race was\r\nin progress, Sir Patrick put a question to the surgeon as they drove\r\nhome, which had been in his mind from the moment when Geoffrey had lost\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hardly understand the anxiety you showed about Delamayn,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen you found that he had only fainted under the fatigue. Was it\r\nsomething more than a common fainting fit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is useless to conceal it now,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Speedwell. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has had a\r\nnarrow escape from a paralytic stroke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas that what you dreaded when you spoke to him at Windygates?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was what I saw in his face when I gave him the warning. I was\r\nright, so far. I was wrong in my estimate of the reserve of vital power\r\nleft in him. When he dropped on the race-course, I firmly believed we\r\nshould find him a dead man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it hereditary paralysis? His father\xe2\x80\x99s last illness was of that\r\nsort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Speedwell smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cHereditary paralysis?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy the man\r\nis (naturally) a phenomenon of health and strength--in the prime of his\r\nlife. Hereditary paralysis might have found him out thirty years\r\nhence. His rowing and his running, for the last four years, are alone\r\nanswerable for what has happened to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick ventured on a suggestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwith your name to compel attention to it, you ought\r\nto make this public--as a warning to others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be quite useless. Delamayn is far from being the first man\r\nwho has dropped at foot-racing, under the cruel stress laid on the vital\r\norgans. The public have a happy knack of forgetting these accidents.\r\nThey would be quite satisfied when they found the other man (who happens\r\nto have got through it) produced as a sufficient answer to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s future was still dwelling on Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s mind. His\r\nnext inquiry related to the serious subject of Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s prospect of\r\nrecovery in the time to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will never recover,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Speedwell. \xe2\x80\x9cParalysis is hanging over\r\nhim. How long he may live it is impossible for me to say. Much depends\r\non himself. In his condition, any new imprudence, any violent emotion,\r\nmay kill him at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf no accident happens,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cwill he be sufficiently\r\nhimself again to leave his bed and go out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has an appointment that I know of for Saturday next. Is it likely\r\nthat he will be able to keep it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite likely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick said no more. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s face was before him again at the\r\nmemorable moment when he had told her that she was Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTEENTH SCENE.--PORTLAND PLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FORTY-SIXTH.\r\n\r\nA SCOTCH MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\nIT was Saturday, the third of October--the day on which the assertion of\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s marriage to Anne Silvester was to be put to the proof.\r\n\r\nToward two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon Blanche and her step-mother entered\r\nthe drawing-room of Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s town house in Portland Place.\r\n\r\nSince the previous evening the weather had altered for the worse. The\r\nrain, which had set in from an early hour that morning, still fell.\r\nViewed from the drawing-room windows, the desolation of Portland Place\r\nin the dead season wore its aspect of deepest gloom. The dreary opposite\r\nhouses were all shut up; the black mud was inches deep in the roadway;\r\nthe soot, floating in tiny black particles, mixed with the falling rain,\r\nand heightened the dirty obscurity of the rising mist. Foot-passengers\r\nand vehicles, succeeding each other at rare intervals, left great gaps\r\nof silence absolutely uninterrupted by sound. Even the grinders of\r\norgans were mute; and the wandering dogs of the street were too wet to\r\nbark. Looking back from the view out of Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s state windows\r\nto the view in Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s state room, the melancholy that reigned\r\nwithout was more than matched by the melancholy that reigned within.\r\nThe house had been shut up for the season: it had not been considered\r\nnecessary, during its mistress\xe2\x80\x99s brief visit, to disturb the existing\r\nstate of things. Coverings of dim brown hue shrouded the furniture.\r\nThe chandeliers hung invisible in enormous bags. The silent clocks\r\nhibernated under extinguishers dropped over them two months since. The\r\ntables, drawn up in corners--loaded with ornaments at other times--had\r\nnothing but pen, ink, and paper (suggestive of the coming proceedings)\r\nplaced on them now. The smell of the house was musty; the voice of the\r\nhouse was still. One melancholy maid haunted the bedrooms up stairs,\r\nlike a ghost. One melancholy man, appointed to admit the visitors, sat\r\nsolitary in the lower regions--the last of the flunkies, mouldering\r\nin an extinct servants\xe2\x80\x99 hall. Not a word passed, in the drawing-room,\r\nbetween Lady Lundie and Blanche. Each waited the appearance of the\r\npersons concerned in the coming inquiry, absorbed in her own thoughts.\r\nTheir situation at the moment was a solemn burlesque of the situation\r\nof two ladies who are giving an evening party, and who are waiting to\r\nreceive their guests. Did neither of them see this? Or, seeing it, did\r\nthey shrink from acknowledging it? In similar positions, who does not\r\nshrink? The occasions are many on which we have excellent reason to\r\nlaugh when the tears are in our eyes; but only children are bold enough\r\nto follow the impulse. So strangely, in human existence, does the\r\nmockery of what is serious mingle with the serious reality itself, that\r\nnothing but our own self-respect preserves our gravity at some of the\r\nmost important emergencies in our lives. The two ladies waited the\r\ncoming ordeal together gravely, as became the occasion. The silent maid\r\nflitted noiseless up stairs. The silent man waited motionless in the\r\nlower regions. Outside, the street was a desert. Inside, the house was a\r\ntomb.\r\n\r\nThe church clock struck the hour. Two.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the first of the persons concerned in the\r\ninvestigation arrived.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie waited composedly for the opening of the drawing-room door.\r\nBlanche started, and trembled. Was it Arnold? Was it Anne?\r\n\r\nThe door opened--and Blanche drew a breath of relief. The first arrival\r\nwas only Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s solicitor--invited to attend the proceedings\r\non her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s behalf. He was one of that large class of purely\r\nmechanical and perfectly mediocre persons connected with the practice\r\nof the law who will probably, in a more advanced state of science,\r\nbe superseded by machinery. He made himself useful in altering the\r\narrangement of the tables and chairs, so as to keep the contending\r\nparties effectually separated from each other. He also entreated Lady\r\nLundie to bear in mind that he knew nothing of Scotch law, and that he\r\nwas there in the capacity of a friend only. This done, he sat down, and\r\nlooked out with silent interest at the rain--as if it was an operation\r\nof Nature which he had never had an opportunity of inspecting before.\r\n\r\nThe next knock at the door heralded the arrival of a visitor of a\r\ntotally different order. The melancholy man-servant announced Captain\r\nNewenden.\r\n\r\nPossibly, in deference to the occasion, possibly, in defiance of the\r\nweather, the captain had taken another backward step toward the days of\r\nhis youth. He was painted and padded, wigged and dressed, to represent\r\nthe abstract idea of a male human being of five-and twenty in robust\r\nhealth. There might have been a little stiffness in the region of\r\nthe waist, and a slight want of firmness in the eyelid and the\r\nchin. Otherwise there was the fiction of five-and twenty, founded in\r\nappearance on the fact of five-and-thirty--with the truth invisible\r\nbehind it, counting seventy years! Wearing a flower in his buttonhole,\r\nand carrying a jaunty little cane in his hand--brisk, rosy, smiling,\r\nperfumed--the captain\xe2\x80\x99s appearance brightened the dreary room. It was\r\npleasantly suggestive of a morning visit from an idle young man. He\r\nappeared to be a little surprised to find Blanche present on the scene\r\nof approaching conflict. Lady Lundie thought it due to herself to\r\nexplain. \xe2\x80\x9cMy step-daughter is here in direct defiance of my entreaties\r\nand my advice. Persons may present themselves whom it is, in my opinion,\r\nimproper she should see. Revelations will take place which no young\r\nwoman, in her position, should hear. She insists on it, Captain\r\nNewenden--and I am obliged to submit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain shrugged his shoulders, and showed his beautiful teeth.\r\n\r\nBlanche was far too deeply interested in the coming ordeal to care\r\nto defend herself: she looked as if she had not even heard what her\r\nstep-mother had said of her. The solicitor remained absorbed in the\r\ninteresting view of the falling rain. Lady Lundie asked after Mrs.\r\nGlenarm. The captain, in reply, described his niece\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety as\r\nsomething--something--something, in short, only to be indicated by\r\nshaking his ambrosial curls and waving his jaunty cane. Mrs. Delamayn\r\nwas staying with her until her uncle returned with the news. And where\r\nwas Julius? Detained in Scotland by election business. And Lord and Lady\r\nHolchester? Lord and Lady Holchester knew nothing about it.\r\n\r\nThere was another knock at the door. Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s pale face turned paler\r\nstill. Was it Arnold? Was it Anne? After a longer delay than usual, the\r\nservant announced Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn and Mr. Moy.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey, slowly entering first, saluted the two ladies in silence, and\r\nnoticed no one else. The London solicitor, withdrawing himself for a\r\nmoment from the absorbing prospect of the rain, pointed to the places\r\nreserved for the new-comer and for the legal adviser whom he had brought\r\nwith him. Geoffrey seated himself, without so much as a glance round the\r\nroom. Leaning his elbows on his knees, he vacantly traced patterns on\r\nthe carpet with his clumsy oaken walking-stick. Stolid indifference\r\nexpressed itself in his lowering brow and his loosely-hanging mouth.\r\nThe loss of the race, and the circumstances accompanying it, appeared\r\nto have made him duller than usual and heavier than usual--and that was\r\nall.\r\n\r\nCaptain Newenden, approaching to speak to him, stopped half-way,\r\nhesitated, thought better of it--and addressed himself to Mr. Moy.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s legal adviser--a Scotchman of the ruddy, ready, and convivial\r\ntype--cordially met the advance. He announced, in reply to the captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninquiry, that the witnesses (Mrs. Inchbare and Bishopriggs) were waiting\r\nbelow until they were wanted, in the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s room. Had there been\r\nany difficulty in finding them? Not the least. Mrs. Inchbare was, as\r\na matter of course, at her hotel. Inquiries being set on foot for\r\nBishopriggs, it appeared that he and the landlady had come to an\r\nunderstanding, and that he had returned to his old post of headwaiter at\r\nthe inn. The captain and Mr. Moy kept up the conversation between them,\r\nthus begun, with unflagging ease and spirit. Theirs were the only voices\r\nheard in the trying interval that elapsed before the next knock was\r\nheard at the door.\r\n\r\nAt last it came. There could be no doubt now as to the persons who might\r\nnext be expected to enter the room. Lady Lundie took her step-daughter\r\nfirmly by the hand. She was not sure of what Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s first impulse\r\nmight lead her to do. For the first time in her life, Blanche left her\r\nhand willingly in her step-mother\xe2\x80\x99s grasp.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and they came in.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick Lundie entered first, with Anne Silvester on his arm. Arnold\r\nBrinkworth followed them.\r\n\r\nBoth Sir Patrick and Anne bowed in silence to the persons assembled.\r\nLady Lundie ceremoniously returned her brother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s salute--and\r\npointedly abstained from noticing Anne\xe2\x80\x99s presence in the room. Blanche\r\nnever looked up. Arnold advanced to her, with his hand held out. Lady\r\nLundie rose, and motioned him back. \xe2\x80\x9cNot _yet,_ Mr. Brinkworth!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, in her most quietly merciless manner. Arnold stood, heedless of\r\nher, looking at his wife. His wife lifted her eyes to his; the tears\r\nrose in them on the instant. Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s dark complexion turned ashy pale\r\nunder the effort that it cost him to command himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t distress\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, gently--and turned back again to the table at which Sir\r\nPatrick and Anne were seated together apart from the rest. Sir Patrick\r\ntook his hand, and pressed it in silent approval.\r\n\r\nThe one person who took no part, even as spectator, in the events\r\nthat followed the appearance of Sir Patrick and his companions in the\r\nroom--was Geoffrey. The only change visible in him was a change in\r\nthe handling of his walking-stick. Instead of tracing patterns on the\r\ncarpet, it beat a tattoo. For the rest, there he sat with his heavy\r\nhead on his breast and his brawny arms on his knees--weary of it by\r\nanticipation before it had begun.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick broke the silence. He addressed himself to his\r\nsister-in-law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Lundie, are all the persons present whom you expected to see here\r\nto-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gathered venom in Lady Lundie seized the opportunity of planting its\r\nfirst sting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll whom I expected are here,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd more than I\r\nexpected,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with a look at Anne.\r\n\r\nThe look was not returned--was not even seen. From the moment when she\r\nhad taken her place by Sir Patrick, Anne\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had rested on\r\nBlanche. They never moved--they never for an instant lost their tender\r\nsadness--when the woman who hated her spoke. All that was beautiful\r\nand true in that noble nature seemed to find its one sufficient\r\nencouragement in Blanche. As she looked once more at the sister of the\r\nunforgotten days of old, its native beauty of expression shone out again\r\nin her worn and weary face. Every man in the room (but Geoffrey) looked\r\nat her; and every man (but Geoffrey) felt for her.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick addressed a second question to his sister-in-law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any one here to represent the interests of Mr. Geoffrey\r\nDelamayn?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie referred Sir Patrick to Geoffrey himself. Without looking\r\nup, Geoffrey motioned with his big brown hand to Mr. Moy, sitting by his\r\nside.\r\n\r\nMr. Moy (holding the legal rank in Scotland which corresponds to the\r\nrank held by solicitors in England) rose and bowed to Sir Patrick, with\r\nthe courtesy due to a man eminent in his time at the Scottish Bar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI represent Mr. Delamayn,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI congratulate myself, Sir\r\nPatrick, on having your ability and experience to appeal to in the\r\nconduct of the pending inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick returned the compliment as well as the bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I who should learn from you,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ have had time,\r\nMr. Moy, to forget what I once knew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie looked from one to the other with unconcealed impatience as\r\nthese formal courtesies were exchanged between the lawyers. \xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to\r\nremind you, gentlemen, of the suspense that we are suffering at this\r\nend of the room,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd permit me to ask when you propose to\r\nbegin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick looked invitingly at Mr. Moy. Mr. Moy looked invitingly at\r\nSir Patrick. More formal courtesies! a polite contest this time as to\r\nwhich of the two learned gentlemen should permit the other to speak\r\nfirst! Mr. Moy\xe2\x80\x99s modesty proving to be quite immovable, Sir Patrick\r\nended it by opening the proceedings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto act on behalf of my friend, Mr. Arnold\r\nBrinkworth. I beg to present him to you, Mr. Moy as the husband of my\r\nniece--to whom he was lawfully married on the seventh of September last,\r\nat the Church of Saint Margaret, in the parish of Hawley, Kent. I have a\r\ncopy of the marriage certificate here--if you wish to look at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Moy\xe2\x80\x99s modesty declined to look at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite needless, Sir Patrick! I admit that a marriage ceremony took\r\nplace on the date named, between the persons named; but I contend that\r\nit was not a valid marriage. I say, on behalf of my client here present\r\n(Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn), that Arnold Brinkworth was married at a date\r\nprior to the seventh of September last--namely, on the fourteenth of\r\nAugust in this year, and at a place called Craig Fernie, in Scotland--to\r\na lady named Anne Silvester, now living, and present among us (as I\r\nunderstand) at this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick presented Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the lady, Mr. Moy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Moy bowed, and made a suggestion. \xe2\x80\x9cTo save needless formalities, Sir\r\nPatrick, shall we take the question of identity as established on both\r\nsides?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick agreed with his learned friend. Lad y Lundie opened and\r\nshut her fan in undisguised impatience. The London solicitor was deeply\r\ninterested. Captain Newenden, taking out his handkerchief, and using\r\nit as a screen, yawned behind it to his heart\xe2\x80\x99s content. Sir Patrick\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou assert the prior marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his colleague. \xe2\x80\x9cIt rests\r\nwith you to begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Moy cast a preliminary look round him at the persons assembled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe object of our meeting here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis, if I am not mistaken,\r\nof a twofold nature. In the first place, it is thought desirable, by\r\na person who has a special interest in the issue of this inquiry\xe2\x80\x9d (he\r\nglanced at the captain--the captain suddenly became attentive), \xe2\x80\x9cto put\r\nmy client\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, relating to Mr. Brinkworth\xe2\x80\x99s marriage, to the\r\nproof. In the second place, we are all equally desirous--whatever\r\ndifference of opinion may otherwise exist--to make this informal inquiry\r\na means, if possible, of avoiding the painful publicity which would\r\nresult from an appeal to a Court of Law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt those words the gathered venom in Lady Lundie planted its second\r\nsting--under cover of a protest addressed to Mr. Moy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg to inform you, Sir, on behalf of my step-daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat we have nothing to dread from the widest publicity. We consent\r\nto be present at, what you call, \xe2\x80\x98this informal inquiry,\xe2\x80\x99 reserving our\r\nright to carry the matter beyond the four walls of this room. I am not\r\nreferring now to Mr. Brinkworth\xe2\x80\x99s chance of clearing himself from an\r\nodious suspicion which rests upon him, and upon another Person present.\r\nThat is an after-matter. The object immediately before us--so far as a\r\nwoman can pretend to understand it--is to establish my step-daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright to call Mr. Brinkworth to account in the character of his wife. If\r\nthe result, so far, fails to satisfy us in that particular, we shall not\r\nhesitate to appeal to a Court of Law.\xe2\x80\x9d She leaned back in her chair, and\r\nopened her fan, and looked round her with the air of a woman who called\r\nsociety to witness that she had done her duty.\r\n\r\nAn expression of pain crossed Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s face while her step-mother\r\nwas speaking. Lady Lundie took her hand for the second time. Blanche\r\nresolutely and pointedly withdrew it--Sir Patrick noticing the action\r\nwith special interest. Before Mr. Moy could say a word in answer, Arnold\r\ncentred the general attention on himself by suddenly interfering in the\r\nproceedings. Blanche looked at him. A bright flash of color appeared on\r\nher face--and left it again. Sir Patrick noted the change of color--and\r\nobserved her more attentively than ever. Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s letter to his wife,\r\nwith time to help it, had plainly shaken her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s influence over\r\nBlanche.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter what Lady Lundie has said, in my wife\xe2\x80\x99s presence,\xe2\x80\x9d Arnold burst\r\nout, in his straightforward, boyish way, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I ought to be allowed\r\nto say a word on my side. I only want to explain how it was I came to\r\ngo to Craig Fernie at all--and I challenge Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn to deny\r\nit, if he can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis voice rose at the last words, and his eyes brightened with\r\nindignation as he looked at Geoffrey.\r\n\r\nMr. Moy appealed to his learned friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith submission, Sir Patrick, to your better judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthis\r\nyoung gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s proposal seems to be a little out of place at the\r\npresent stage of the proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have yourself described\r\nthe proceedings as representing an informal inquiry. An informal\r\nproposal--with submission to _your_ better judgment, Mr. Moy--is hardly\r\nout of place, under those circumstances, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Moy\xe2\x80\x99s inexhaustible modesty gave way, without a struggle. The answer\r\nwhich he received had the effect of puzzling him at the outset of the\r\ninvestigation. A man of Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s experience must have known that\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s mere assertion of his own innocence could be productive of\r\nnothing but useless delay in the proceedings. And yet he sanctioned that\r\ndelay. Was he privately on the watch for any accidental circumstance\r\nwhich might help him to better a case that he knew to be a bad one?\r\n\r\nPermitted to speak, Arnold spoke. The unmistakable accent of truth was\r\nin every word that he uttered. He gave a fairly coherent account of\r\nevents, from the time when Geoffrey had claimed his assistance at the\r\nlawn-party to the time when he found himself at the door of the inn\r\nat Craig Fernie. There Sir Patrick interfered, and closed his lips. He\r\nasked leave to appeal to Geoffrey to confirm him. Sir Patrick amazed\r\nMr. Moy by sanctioning this irregularity also. Arnold sternly addressed\r\nhimself to Geoffrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you deny that what I have said is true?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nMr. Moy did his duty by his client. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not bound to answer,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cunless you wish it yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey slowly lifted his heavy head, and confronted the man whom he\r\nhad betrayed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI deny every word of it,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered--with a stolid defiance of tone\r\nand manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave we had enough of assertion and counter-assertion, Sir Patrick, by\r\nthis time?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Moy, with undiminished politeness.\r\n\r\nAfter first forcing Arnold--with some little difficulty--to control\r\nhimself, Sir Patrick raised Mr. Moy\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment to the culminating\r\npoint. For reasons of his own, he determined to strengthen the favorable\r\nimpression which Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s statement had plainly produced on his wife\r\nbefore the inquiry proceeded a step farther.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must throw myself on your indulgence, Mr. Moy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not\r\nhad enough of assertion and counter-assertion, even yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Moy leaned back in his chair, with a mixed expression of\r\nbewilderment and resignation. Either his colleague\xe2\x80\x99s intellect was in a\r\nfailing state--or his colleague had some purpose in view which had not\r\nopenly asserted itself yet. He began to suspect that the right reading\r\nof the riddle was involved in the latter of those two alternatives.\r\nInstead of entering any fresh protest, he wisely waited and watched.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick went on unblushingly from one irregularity to another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI request Mr. Moy\xe2\x80\x99s permission to revert to the alleged marriage, on\r\nthe fourteenth of August, at Craig Fernie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cArnold Brinkworth!\r\nanswer for yourself, in the presence of the persons here assembled. In\r\nall that you said, and all that you did, while you were at the inn, were\r\nyou not solely influenced by the wish to make Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s position\r\nas little painful to her as possible, and by anxiety to carry out the\r\ninstructions given to you by Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn? Is that the whole\r\ntruth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the whole truth, Sir Patrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the day when you went to Craig Fernie, had you not, a few hours\r\npreviously, applied for my permission to marry my niece?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI applied for your permission, Sir Patrick; and you gave it me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the moment when you entered the inn to the moment when you left\r\nit, were you absolutely innocent of the slightest intention to marry\r\nMiss Silvester?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo such thing as the thought of marrying Miss Silvester ever entered my\r\nhead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this you say, on your word of honor as a gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my word of honor as a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick turned to Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it a matter of necessity, Miss Silvester, that you should appear\r\nin the assumed character of a married woman--on the fourteenth of August\r\nlast, at the Craig Fernie inn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne looked away from Blanche for the first time. She replied to Sir\r\nPatrick quietly, readily, firmly--Blanche looking at her, and listening\r\nto her with eager interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went to the inn alone, Sir Patrick. The landlady refused, in the\r\nplainest terms, to let me stay there, unless she was first satisfied\r\nthat I was a married woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich of the two gentlemen did you expect to join you at the inn--Mr.\r\nArnold Brinkworth, or Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Geoffrey Delamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Mr. Arnold Brinkworth came in his place and said what was\r\nnecessary to satisfy the scruples of the landlady, you understood that\r\nhe was acting in your interests, from motives of kindness only, and\r\nunder the instructions of Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understood that; and I objected as strongly as I could to Mr.\r\nBrinkworth placing himself in a false position on my account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid your objection proceed from any knowledge of the Scottish law of\r\nmarriage, and of the position in which the peculiarities of that law\r\nmight place Mr. Brinkworth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no knowledge of the Scottish law. I had a vague dislike and dread\r\nof the deception which Mr. Brinkworth was practicing on the people\r\nof the inn. And I feared that it might lead to some possible\r\nmisinterpretation of me on the part of a person whom I dearly loved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat person being my niece?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou appealed to Mr. Brinkworth (knowing of his attachment to my niece),\r\nin her name, and for her sake, to leave you to shift for yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a gentleman who had given his promise to help and protect a lady,\r\nin the absence of the person whom she had depended on to join her, he\r\nrefused to leave you to shift by yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnhappily, he refused on that account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom first to last, you were absolutely innocent of the slightest\r\nintention to marry Mr. Brinkworth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI answer, Sir Patrick, as Mr. Brinkworth has answered. No such thing as\r\nthe thought of marrying him ever entered my head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this you say, on your oath as a Christian woman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn my oath as a Christian woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick looked round at Blanche. Her face was hidden in her hands.\r\nHer step-mother was vainly appealing to her to compose herself.\r\n\r\nIn the moment of silence that followed, Mr. Moy interfered in the\r\ninterests of his client.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI waive my claim, Sir Patrick, to put any questions on my side. I\r\nmerely desire to remind you, and to remind the company present, that all\r\nthat we have just heard is mere assertion--on the part of two persons\r\nstrongly interested in extricating themselves from a position which\r\nfatally compromises them both. The marriage which they deny I am\r\nnow waiting to prove--not by assertion, on my side, but by appeal to\r\ncompetent witnesses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a brief consultation with her own solicitor, Lady Lundie followed\r\nMr. Moy, in stronger language still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you to understand, Sir Patrick, before you proceed any farther,\r\nthat I shall remove my step-daughter from the room if any more attempts\r\nare made to harrow her feelings and mislead her judgment. I want words\r\nto express my sense of this most cruel and unfair way of conducting the\r\ninquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe London lawyer followed, stating his professional approval of his\r\nclient\xe2\x80\x99s view. \xe2\x80\x9cAs her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s legal adviser,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI support\r\nthe protest which her ladyship has just made.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven Captain Newenden agreed in the general disapproval of Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconduct. \xe2\x80\x9cHear, hear!\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, when the lawyer had spoken.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right. I must say, quite right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nApparently impenetrable to all due sense of his position, Sir Patrick\r\naddressed himself to Mr. Moy, as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish to produce your witnesses at once?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not\r\nthe least objection to meet your views--on the understanding that I am\r\npermitted to return to the proceedings as interrupted at this point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Moy considered. The adversary (there could be no doubt of it by this\r\ntime) had something in reserve--and the adversary had not yet shown his\r\nhand. It was more immediately important to lead him into doing this than\r\nto insist on rights and privileges of the purely formal sort. Nothing\r\ncould shake the strength of the position which Mr. Moy occupied. The\r\nlonger Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s irregularities delayed the proceedings, the more\r\nirresistibly the plain facts of the case would assert themselves--with\r\nall the force of contrast--out of the mouths of the witnesses who were\r\nin attendance down stairs. He determined to wait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReserving my right of objection, Sir Patrick,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI beg you\r\nto go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo the surprise of every body, Sir Patrick addressed himself directly\r\nto Blanche--quoting the language in which Lady Lundie had spoken to him,\r\nwith perfect composure of tone and manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know me well enough, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto be assured that I\r\nam incapable of willingly harrowing your feelings or misleading your\r\njudgment. I have a question to ask you, which you can answer or not,\r\nentirely as you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore he could put the question there was a momentary contest between\r\nLady Lundie and her legal adviser. Silencing her ladyship (not without\r\ndifficulty), the London lawyer interposed. He also begged leave to\r\nreserve the right of objection, so far as _his_ client was concerned.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick assented by a sign, and proceeded to put his question to\r\nBlanche.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard what Arnold Brinkworth has said, and what Miss Silvester\r\nhas said,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe husband who loves you, and the sisterly\r\nfriend who loves you, have each made a solemn declaration. Recall your\r\npast experience of both of them; remember what they have just said; and\r\nnow tell me--do you believe they have spoken falsely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche answered on the instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe, uncle, they have spoken the truth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth the lawyers registered their objections. Lady Lundie made another\r\nattempt to speak, and was stopped once more--this time by Mr. Moy as\r\nwell as by her own adviser. Sir Patrick went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you feel any doubt as to the entire propriety of your husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconduct and your friend\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, now you have seen them and heard\r\nthem, face to face?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche answered again, with the same absence of reserve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask them to forgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe I have done them both a\r\ngreat wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at her husband first--then at Anne. Arnold attempted to leave\r\nhis chair. Sir Patrick firmly restrained him. \xe2\x80\x9cWait!\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what is coming.\xe2\x80\x9d Having said that, he turned toward Anne.\r\nBlanche\xe2\x80\x99s look had gone to the heart of the faithful woman who loved\r\nher. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s face was turned away--the tears were forcing themselves\r\nthrough the worn weak hands that tried vainly to hide them.\r\n\r\nThe formal objections of the lawyers were registered once more. Sir\r\nPatrick addressed himself to his niece for the last time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou believe what Arnold Brinkworth has said; you believe what Miss\r\nSilvester has said. You know that not even the thought of marriage was\r\nin the mind of either of them, at the inn. You know--whatever else may\r\nhappen in the future--that there is not the most remote possibility of\r\neither of them consenting to acknowledge that they ever have been, or\r\never can be, Man and Wife. Is that enough for you? Are you willing,\r\nbefore this inquiry proceeds any farther to take your husband\xe2\x80\x99s hand;\r\nto return to your husband\xe2\x80\x99s protection; and to leave the rest to\r\nme--satisfied with my assurance that, on the facts as they happened, not\r\neven the Scotch Law can prove the monstrous assertion of the marriage at\r\nCraig Fernie to be true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie rose. Both the lawyers rose. Arnold sat lost in\r\nastonishment. Geoffrey himself--brutishly careless thus far of all that\r\nhad passed--lifted his head with a sudden start. In the midst of the\r\nprofound impression thus produced, Blanche, on whose decision the whole\r\nfuture course of the inquiry now turned, answered in these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will not think me ungrateful, uncle. I am sure that Arnold\r\nhas not, knowingly, done me any wrong. But I can\xe2\x80\x99t go back to him until\r\nI am first _certain_ that I am his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie embraced her step-daughter with a sudden outburst of\r\naffection. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear child!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed her ladyship, fervently. \xe2\x80\x9cWell\r\ndone, my own dear child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s head dropped on his breast. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Blanche! Blanche!\xe2\x80\x9d Arnold\r\nheard him whisper to himself; \xe2\x80\x9cif you only knew what you are forcing me\r\nto!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Moy put in his word, on Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s side of the question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must most respectfully express my approval also of the course which\r\nthe young lady has taken,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cA more dangerous compromise than\r\nthe compromise which we have just heard suggested it is difficult to\r\nimagine. With all deference to Sir Patrick Lundie, his opinion of the\r\nimpossibility of proving the marriage at Craig Fernie remains to be\r\nconfirmed as the right one. My own professional opinion is opposed\r\nto it. The opinion of another Scottish lawyer (in Glasgow) is, to my\r\ncertain knowledge, opposed to it. If the young lady had not acted with\r\na wisdom and courage which do her honor, she might have lived to see\r\nthe day when her reputation would have been destroyed, and her children\r\ndeclared illegitimate. Who is to say that circumstances may not happen\r\nin the future which may force Mr. Brinkworth or Miss Silvester--one or\r\nthe other--to assert the very marriage which they repudiate now? Who is\r\nto say that interested relatives (property being concerned here) may not\r\nin the lapse of years, discover motives of their own for questioning\r\nthe asserted marriage in Kent? I acknowledge that I envy the immense\r\nself-confidence which emboldens Sir Patrick to venture, what he is\r\nwilling to venture upon his own individual opinion on an undecided point\r\nof law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down amidst a murmur of approval, and cast a slyly-expectant look\r\nat his defeated adversary. \xe2\x80\x9cIf _that_ doesn\xe2\x80\x99t irritate him into showing\r\nhis hand,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mr. Moy, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing will!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick slowly raised his head. There was no irritation--there was\r\nonly distress in his face--when he spoke next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t propose, Mr. Moy, to argue the point with you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\ngently. \xe2\x80\x9cI can understand that my conduct must necessarily appear\r\nstrange and even blameworthy, not in your eyes only, but in the eyes of\r\nothers. My young friend here will tell you\xe2\x80\x9d (he looked toward Arnold)\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat the view which you express as to the future peril involved in this\r\ncase was once the view in my mind too, and that in what I have done thus\r\nfar I have acted in direct contradiction to advice which I myself gave\r\nat no very distant period. Excuse me, if you please, from entering (for\r\nthe present at least) into the motive which has influenced me from\r\nthe time when I entered this room. My position is one of unexampled\r\nresponsibility and of indescribable distress. May I appeal to that\r\nstatement to stand as my excuse, if I plead for a last extension of\r\nindulgence toward the last irregularity of which I shall be guilty, in\r\nconnection with these proceedings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie alone resisted the unaffected and touching dignity with\r\nwhich those words were spoken.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have had enough of irregularity,\xe2\x80\x9d she said sternly. \xe2\x80\x9cI, for one,\r\nobject to more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick waited patiently for Mr. Moy\xe2\x80\x99s reply. The Scotch lawyer and\r\nthe English lawyer looked at each other--and understood each other. Mr.\r\nMoy answered for both.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t presume to restrain you, Sir Patrick, by other limits than\r\nthose which, as a gentleman, you impose on yourself. Subject,\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\nthe cautious Scotchman, \xe2\x80\x9cto the right of objection which we have already\r\nreserved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you object to my speaking to your client?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll eyes turned on Geoffrey. He was sitting half asleep, as it\r\nseemed--with his heavy hands hanging listlessly over his knees, and his\r\nchin resting on the hooked handle of his stick.\r\n\r\nLooking toward Anne, when Sir Patrick pronounced Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s name, Mr.\r\nMoy saw a change in her. She withdrew her hands from her face, and\r\nturned suddenly toward her legal adviser. Was she in the secret of the\r\ncarefully concealed object at which his opponent had been aiming from\r\nthe first? Mr. Moy decided to put that doubt to the test. He invited\r\nSir Patrick, by a gesture, to proceed. Sir Patrick addressed himself to\r\nGeoffrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are seriously interested in this inquiry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand you have\r\ntaken no part in it yet. Take a part in it now. Look at this lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey never moved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen enough of her already,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, brutally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may well be ashamed to look at her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick, quietly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you might have acknowledged it in fitter words. Carry your memory\r\nback to the fourteenth of August. Do you deny that you promised to many\r\nMiss Silvester privately at the Craig Fernie inn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI object to that question,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Moy. \xe2\x80\x9cMy client is under no sort\r\nof obligation to answer it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s rising temper--ready to resent any thing--resented his\r\nadviser\xe2\x80\x99s interference. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall answer if I like,\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted,\r\ninsolently. He looked up for a moment at Sir Patrick, without moving his\r\nchin from the hook of his stick. Then he looked down again. \xe2\x80\x9cI do deny\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou deny that you have promised to marry Miss Silvester?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI asked you just now to look at her--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I told you I had seen enough of her already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at _me._ In my presence, and in the presence of the other persons\r\nhere, do you deny that you owe this lady, by your own solemn engagement,\r\nthe reparation of marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe suddenly lifted his head. His eyes, after resting for an instant only\r\non Sir Patrick, turned, little by little; and, brightening slowly, fixed\r\nthemselves with a hideous, tigerish glare on Anne\xe2\x80\x99s face. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what I\r\nowe her,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThe devouring hatred of his look was matched by the ferocious\r\nvindictiveness of his tone, as he spoke those words. It was horrible to\r\nsee him; it was horrible to hear him. Mr. Moy said to him, in a whisper,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cControl yourself, or I will throw up your case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout answering--without even listening--he lifted one of his hands,\r\nand looked at it vacantly. He whispered something to himself; and\r\ncounted out what he was whispering slowly; in divisions of his own, on\r\nthree of his fingers in succession. He fixed his eyes again on Anne with\r\nthe same devouring hatred in their look, and spoke (this time directly\r\naddressing himself to her) with the same ferocious vindictiveness in his\r\ntone. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for you, I should be married to Mrs. Glenarm. But for you,\r\nI should be friends with my father. But for you, I should have won\r\nthe race. I know what I owe you.\xe2\x80\x9d His loosely hanging hands stealthily\r\nclenched themselves. His head sank again on his broad breast. He said no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nNot a soul moved--not a word was spoken. The same common horror held\r\nthem all speechless. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s eyes turned once more on Blanche. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncourage upheld her, even at that moment.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick rose. The strong emotion which he had suppressed thus far,\r\nshowed itself plainly in his face--uttered itself plainly in his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome into the next room,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cI must speak to you\r\ninstantly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout noticing the astonishment that he caused; without paying\r\nthe smallest attention to the remonstrances addressed to him by his\r\nsister-in-law and by the Scotch lawyer, he took Anne by the arm, opened\r\nthe folding-doors at one end of the room--entered the room beyond with\r\nher--and closed the doors again.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie appealed to her legal adviser. Blanche rose--advanced a few\r\nsteps--and stood in breathless suspense, looking at the folding-doors.\r\nArnold advanced a step, to speak to his wife. The captain approached Mr.\r\nMoy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nMr. Moy answered, in strong agitation on his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means that I have not been properly instructed. Sir Patrick Lundie\r\nhas some evidence in his possession that seriously compromises Mr.\r\nDelamayn\xe2\x80\x99s case. He has shrunk from producing it hitherto--he finds\r\nhimself forced to produce it now. How is it,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lawyer, turning\r\nsternly on his client, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you have left me in the dark?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing about it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Geoffrey, without lifting his head.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie signed to Blanche to stand aside, and advanced toward the\r\nfolding-doors. Mr. Moy stopped her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI advise your ladyship to be patient. Interference is useless there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I not to interfere, Sir, in my own house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless I am entirely mistaken, madam, the end of the proceedings\r\nin your house is at hand. You will damage your own interests by\r\ninterfering. Let us know what we are about at last. Let the end come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie yielded, and returned to her place. They all waited in\r\nsilence for the opening of the doors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Patrick Lundie and Anne Silvester were alone in the room.\r\n\r\nHe took from the breast-pocket of his coat the sheet of note-paper which\r\ncontained Anne\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s reply. His hand trembled as he\r\nheld it; his voice faltered as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done all that can be done,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have left nothing\r\nuntried, to prevent the necessity of producing this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel your kindness gratefully, Sir Patrick. You must produce it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe woman\xe2\x80\x99s calmness presented a strange and touching contrast to\r\nthe man\xe2\x80\x99s emotion. There was no shrinking in her face, there was no\r\nunsteadiness in her voice as she answered him. He took her hand. Twice\r\nhe attempted to speak; and twice his own agitation overpowered him. He\r\noffered the letter to her in silence.\r\n\r\nIn silence, on her side, she put the letter away from her, wondering\r\nwhat he meant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it back,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t produce it! I daren\xe2\x80\x99t produce it!\r\nAfter what my own eyes have seen, after what my own ears have heard,\r\nin the next room--as God is my witness, I daren\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to declare\r\nyourself Geoffrey Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s wife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered him in one word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlanche!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head impatiently. \xe2\x80\x9cNot even in Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s interests! Not\r\neven for Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s sake! If there is any risk, it is a risk I am ready\r\nto run. I hold to my own opinion. I believe my own view to be right. Let\r\nit come to an appeal to the law! I will fight the case, and win it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you _sure_ of winning it, Sir Patrick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of replying, he pressed the letter on her. \xe2\x80\x9cDestroy it,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwhispered. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd rely on my silence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe took the letter from him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDestroy it,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cThey may open the doors. They may come in at\r\nany moment, and see it in your hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have something to ask you, Sir Patrick, before I destroy it. Blanche\r\nrefuses to go back to her husband, unless she returns with the certain\r\nassurance of being really his wife. If I produce this letter, she may\r\ngo back to him to-day. If I declare myself Geoffrey Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s wife, I\r\nclear Arnold Brinkworth, at once and forever of all suspicion of being\r\nmarried to me. Can you as certainly and effectually clear him in any\r\nother way? Answer me that, as a man of honor speaking to a woman who\r\nimplicitly trusts him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked him full in the face. His eyes dropped before hers--he made\r\nno reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am answered,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nWith those words, she passed him, and laid her hand on the door.\r\n\r\nHe checked her. The tears rose in his eyes as he drew her gently back\r\ninto the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should we wait?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cas a favor to _me._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seated herself calmly in the nearest chair, and rested her head on\r\nher hand, thinking.\r\n\r\nHe bent over her, and roused her, impatiently, almost angrily. The\r\nsteady resolution in her face was terrible to him, when he thought of\r\nthe man in the next room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake time to consider,\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be led away by your own\r\nimpulse. Don\xe2\x80\x99t act under a false excitement. Nothing binds you to this\r\ndreadful sacrifice of yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcitement! Sacrifice!\xe2\x80\x9d She smiled sadly as she repeated the words. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou know, Sir Patrick, what I was thinking of a moment since? Only of\r\nold times, when I was a little girl. I saw the sad side of life sooner\r\nthan most children see it. My mother was cruelly deserted. The hard\r\nmarriage laws of this country were harder on her than on me. She died\r\nbroken-hearted. But one friend comforted her at the last moment, and\r\npromised to be a mother to her child. I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember one unhappy day\r\nin all the after-time when I lived with that faithful woman and her\r\nlittle daughter--till the day that parted us. She went away with her\r\nhusband; and I and the little daughter were left behind. She said her\r\nlast words to me. Her heart was sinking under the dread of coming death.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I promised your mother that you should be like my own child to me,\r\nand it quieted her mind. Quiet _my_ mind, Anne, before I go. Whatever\r\nhappens in years to come--promise me to be always what you are now, a\r\nsister to Blanche.\xe2\x80\x99 Where is the false excitement, Sir Patrick, in old\r\nremembrances like these? And how can there be a sacrifice in any thing\r\nthat I do for Blanche?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose, and offered him her hand. Sir Patrick lifted it to his lips in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor both our sakes, let us not prolong this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned aside his head. It was no moment to let her see that she had\r\ncompletely unmanned him. She waited for him, with her hand on the lock.\r\nHe rallied his courage--he forced himself to face the horror of the\r\nsituation calmly. She opened the door, and led the way back into the\r\nother room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot a word was spoken by any of the persons present, as the two returned\r\nto their places. The noise of a carriage passing in the street was\r\npainfully audible. The chance banging of a door in the lower regions of\r\nthe house made every one start.\r\n\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s sweet voice broke the dreary silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust I speak for myself, Sir Patrick? Or will you (I ask it as a last\r\nand greatest favor) speak for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou insist on appealing to the letter in your hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am resolved to appeal to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill nothing induce you to defer the close of this inquiry--so far as\r\nyou are concerned--for four-and-twenty hours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEither you or I, Sir Patrick, must say what is to be said, and do what\r\nis to be done, before we leave this room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me the letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave it to him. Mr. Moy whispered to his client, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what\r\nthat is?\xe2\x80\x9d Geoffrey shook his head. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you really remember nothing about\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d Geoffrey answered in one surly word, \xe2\x80\x9cNothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick addressed himself to the assembled company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have to ask your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor abruptly leaving the room,\r\nand for obliging Miss Silvester to leave it with me. Every body present,\r\nexcept that man\xe2\x80\x9d (he pointed to Geoffrey), \xe2\x80\x9cwill, I believe, understand\r\nand forgive me, now that I am forced to make my conduct the subject\r\nof the plainest and the fullest explanation. I shall address that\r\nexplanation, for reasons which will presently appear, to my niece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche started. \xe2\x80\x9cTo me!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo you,\xe2\x80\x9d Sir Patrick answered.\r\n\r\nBlanche turned toward Arnold, daunted by a vague sense of something\r\nserious to come. The letter that she had received from her husband on\r\nher departure from Ham Farm had necessarily alluded to relations between\r\nGeoffrey and Anne, of which Blanche had been previously ignorant. Was\r\nany reference coming to those relations? Was there something yet to be\r\ndisclosed which Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s letter had not prepared her to hear?\r\n\r\nSir Patrick resumed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA short time since,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Blanche, \xe2\x80\x9cI proposed to you to return\r\nto your husband\xe2\x80\x99s protection--and to leave the termination of this\r\nmatter in my hands. You have refused to go back to him until you are\r\nfirst certainly assured that you are his wife. Thanks to a sacrifice\r\nto your interests and your happiness, on Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s part--which I\r\ntell you frankly I have done my utmost to prevent--I am in a position to\r\nprove positively that Arnold Brinkworth was a single man when he married\r\nyou from my house in Kent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Moy\xe2\x80\x99s experience forewarned him of what was coming. He pointed to\r\nthe letter in Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you claim on a promise of marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick rejoined by putting a question on his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember the famous decision at Doctors\xe2\x80\x99 Commons, which\r\nestablished the marriage of Captain Dalrymple and Miss Gordon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Moy was answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand you, Sir Patrick,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. After\r\na moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, he addressed his next words to Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd from the\r\nbottom of my heart, madam, I respect _you._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was said with a fervent sincerity of tone which wrought the interest\r\nof the other persons, who were still waiting for enlightenment, to the\r\nhighest pitch. Lady Lundie and Captain Newenden whispered to each other\r\nanxiously. Arnold turned pale. Blanche burst into tears.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick turned once more to his niece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome little time since,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI had occasion to speak to you of\r\nthe scandalous uncertainty of the marriage laws of Scotland. But for\r\nthat uncertainty (entirely without parallel in any other civilized\r\ncountry in Europe), Arnold Brinkworth would never have occupied the\r\nposition in which he stands here to-day--and these proceedings\r\nwould never have taken place. Bear that fact in mind. It is not only\r\nanswerable for the mischief that has been already done, but for the far\r\nmore serious evil which is still to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Moy took a note. Sir Patrick went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLoose and reckless as the Scotch law is, there happens, however, to be\r\none case in which the action of it has been confirmed and settled by the\r\nEnglish Courts. A written promise of marriage exchanged between a man\r\nand woman, in Scotland, marries that man and woman by Scotch law. An\r\nEnglish Court of Justice (sitting in judgment on the ease I have just\r\nmentioned to Mr. Moy) has pronounced that law to be good--and the\r\ndecision has since been confirmed by the supreme authority of the House\r\nof Lords. Where the persons therefore--living in Scotland at the\r\ntime--have promised each other marriage in writing, there is now no\r\nlonger any doubt they are certainly, and lawfully, Man and Wife.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nturned from his niece, and appealed to Mr. Moy. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite right, Sir Patrick, as to the facts. I own, however, that your\r\ncommentary on them surprises me. I have the highest opinion of our\r\nScottish marriage law. A man who has betrayed a woman under a promise of\r\nmarriage is forced by that law (in the interests of public morality) to\r\nacknowledge her as his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe persons here present, Mr. Moy, are now about to see the moral merit\r\nof the Scotch law of marriage (as approved by England) practically in\r\noperation before their own eyes. They will judge for themselves of the\r\nmorality (Scotch or English) which first forces a deserted woman back on\r\nthe villain who has betrayed her, and then virtuously leaves her to bear\r\nthe consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that answer, he turned to Anne, and showed her the letter, open in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the last time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you insist on my appealing to this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose, and bowed her head gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my distressing duty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cto declare, in this\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s name, and on the faith of written promises of marriage exchanged\r\nbetween the parties, then residing in Scotland, that she claims to\r\nbe now--and to have been on the afternoon of the fourteenth of August\r\nlast--Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s wedded wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA cry of horror from Blanche, a low murmur of dismay from the rest,\r\nfollowed the utterance of those words.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause of an instant.\r\n\r\nThen Geoffrey rose slowly to his feet, and fixed his eyes on the wife\r\nwho had claimed him.\r\n\r\nThe spectators of the terrible scene turned with one accord toward the\r\nsacrificed woman. The look which Geoffrey had cast on her--the words\r\nwhich Geoffrey had spoken to her--were present to all their minds. She\r\nstood, waiting by Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s side--her soft gray eyes resting sadly\r\nand tenderly on Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s face. To see that matchless courage and\r\nresignation was to doubt the reality of what had happened. They were\r\nforced to look back at the man to possess their minds with the truth.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of law and morality over him was complete. He never uttered\r\na word. His furious temper was perfectly and fearfully calm. With the\r\npromise of merciless vengeance written in the Devil s writing on his\r\nDevil-possessed face, he kept his eyes fixed on the hated woman whom he\r\nhad ruined--on the hated woman who was fastened to him as his wife.\r\n\r\nHis lawyer went over to the table at which Sir Patrick sat. Sir Patrick\r\nhanded him the sheet of note-paper.\r\n\r\nHe read the two letters contained in it with absorbed and deliberate\r\nattention. The moments that passed before he lifted his head from his\r\nreading seemed like hours. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you prove the handwritings?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd prove the residence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick took up a second morsel of paper lying ready under his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are the names of persons who can prove the writing, and prove\r\nthe residence,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of your two witnesses below stairs\r\n(otherwise useless) can speak to the hour at which Mr. Brinkworth\r\narrived at the inn, and so can prove that the lady for whom he asked\r\nwas, at that moment, Mrs. Geoffrey Delamayn. The indorsement on the back\r\nof the note-paper, also referring to the question of time, is in the\r\nhandwriting of the same witness--to whom I refer you, when it suits your\r\nconvenience to question him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will verify the references, Sir Patrick, as matter of form. In the\r\nmean time, not to interpose needless and vexatious delay, I am bound to\r\nsay that I can not resist the evidence of the marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving replied in those terms he addressed himself, with marked respect\r\nand sympathy, to Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the faith of the written promise of marriage exchanged between\r\nyou in Scotland,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou claim Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn as your\r\nhusband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe steadily repented the words after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI claim Mr. Geoffrey Delamayn as my husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Moy appealed to his client. Geoffrey broke silence at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it settled?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo all practical purposes, it is settled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went on, still looking at nobody but Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the law of Scotland made her my wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe law of Scotland has made her your wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe asked a third and last question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes the law tell her to go where her husband goes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laughed softly to himself, and beckoned to her to cross the room to\r\nthe place at which he was standing.\r\n\r\nShe obeyed. At the moment when she took the first step to approach him,\r\nSir Patrick caught her hand, and whispered to her, \xe2\x80\x9cRely on me!\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\ngently pressed his hand in token that she understood him, and advanced\r\nto Geoffrey. At the same moment, Blanche rushed between them, and flung\r\nher arms around Anne\xe2\x80\x99s neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Anne! Anne!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn hysterical passion of tears choked her utterance. Anne gently unwound\r\nthe arms that clung round her--gently lifted the head that lay helpless\r\non her bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappier days are coming, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think of _me._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kissed her--looked at her--kissed her again--and placed her in her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s arms. Arnold remembered her parting words at Craig Fernie,\r\nwhen they had wished each other good-night. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have not befriended an\r\nungrateful woman. The day may yet come when I shall prove it.\xe2\x80\x9d Gratitude\r\nand admiration struggled in him which should utter itself first, and\r\nheld him speechless.\r\n\r\nShe bent her head gently in token that she understood him. Then she went\r\non, and stood before Geoffrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you wish me to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA hideous smile parted his heavy lips. He offered her his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Geoffrey Delamayn,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cCome home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe picture of the lonely house, isolated amidst its high walls; the\r\nill-omened figure of the dumb woman with the stony eyes and the savage\r\nways--the whole scene, as Anne had pictured it to him but two days\r\nsince, rose vivid as reality before Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s mind. \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried\r\nout, carried away by the generous impulse of the moment. \xe2\x80\x9cIt shall _not_\r\nbe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey stood impenetrable--waiting with his offered arm. Pale and\r\nresolute, she lifted her noble head--called back the courage which had\r\nfaltered for a moment--and took his arm. He led her to the door. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet Blanche fret about me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, simply, to Arnold as they went by.\r\nThey passed Sir Patrick next. Once more his sympathy for her set\r\nevery other consideration at defiance. He started up to bar the way to\r\nGeoffrey. Geoffrey paused, and looked at Sir Patrick for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe law tells her to go with her husband,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe law forbids\r\nyou to part Man and Wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrue. Absolutely, undeniably true. The law sanctioned the sacrifice of\r\nher as unanswerably as it had sanctioned the sacrifice of her mother\r\nbefore her. In the name of Morality, let him take her! In the interests\r\nof Virtue, let her get out of it if she can!\r\n\r\nHer husband opened the door. Mr. Moy laid his hand on Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\nLady Lundie, Captain Newenden, the London lawyer, all left their places,\r\ninfluenced, for once, by the same interest; feeling, for once, the same\r\nsuspense. Arnold followed them, supporting his wife. For one memorable\r\ninstant Anne looked back at them all. Then she and her husband crossed\r\nthe threshold. They descended the stairs together. The opening and\r\nclosing of the house door was heard. They were gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDone, in the name of Morality. Done, in the interests of Virtue. Done,\r\nin an age of progress, and under the most perfect government on the face\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTEENTH SCENE.--HOLCHESTER HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FORTY-SEVENTH.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST CHANCE.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHIS lordship is dangerously ill, Sir. Her ladyship can receive no\r\nvisitors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe so good as to take that card to Lady Holchester. It is absolutely\r\nnecessary that your mistress should be made acquainted--in the interests\r\nof her younger son--with something which I can only mention to her\r\nladyship herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two persons speaking were Lord Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s head servant and Sir\r\nPatrick Lundie. At that time barely half an hour had passed since the\r\nclose of the proceedings at Portland Place.\r\n\r\nThe servant still hesitated with the card in his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall forfeit\r\nmy situation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif I do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will most assuredly forfeit your situation if you _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ do it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n returned Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cI warn you plainly, this is too serious a matter\r\nto be trifled with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone in which those words were spoken had its effect. The man went\r\nup stairs with his message.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick waited in the hall. Even the momentary delay of entering\r\none of the reception-rooms was more than he could endure at that moment.\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s happiness was hopelessly sacrificed already. The preservation\r\nof her personal safety--which Sir Patrick firmly believed to be in\r\ndanger--was the one service which it was possible to render to her\r\nnow. The perilous position in which she stood toward her husband--as\r\nan immovable obstacle, while she lived, between Geoffrey and Mrs.\r\nGlenarm--was beyond the reach of remedy. But it was still possible to\r\nprevent her from becoming the innocent cause of Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s pecuniary\r\nruin, by standing in the way of a reconciliation between father and son.\r\n\r\nResolute to leave no means untried of serving Anne\xe2\x80\x99s interests, Sir\r\nPatrick had allowed Arnold and Blanche to go to his own residence in\r\nLondon, alone, and had not even waited to say a farewell word to any of\r\nthe persons who had taken part in the inquiry. \xe2\x80\x9cHer life may depend on\r\nwhat I can do for her at Holchester House!\xe2\x80\x9d With that conviction in him,\r\nhe had left Portland Place. With that conviction in him, he had sent his\r\nmessage to Lady Holchester, and was now waiting for the reply.\r\n\r\nThe servant appeared again on the stairs. Sir Patrick went up to meet\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer ladyship will see you, Sir, for a few minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door of an upper room was opened; and Sir Patrick found himself in\r\nthe presence of Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s mother. There was only time to observe that\r\nshe possessed the remains of rare personal beauty, and that she\r\nreceived her visitor with a grace and courtesy which implied (under the\r\ncircumstances) a considerate regard for _his_ position at the expense of\r\nher own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have something to say to me, Sir Patrick, on the subject of my\r\nsecond son. I am in great affliction. If you bring me bad news, I will\r\ndo my best to bear it. May I trust to your kindness not to keep me in\r\nsuspense?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will help me to make my intrusion as little painful as possible\r\nto your ladyship,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cif I am permitted to ask a\r\nquestion. Have you heard of any obstacle to the contemplated marriage of\r\nMr. Geoffrey Delamayn and Mrs. Glenarm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven that distant reference to Anne produced an ominous change for the\r\nworse in Lady Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard of the obstacle to which you allude,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs.\r\nGlenarm is an intimate friend of mine. She has informed me that a person\r\nnamed Silvester, an impudent adventuress--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s pardon. You are doing a cruel wrong to the\r\nnoblest woman I have ever met with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can not undertake, Sir Patrick, to enter into your reasons for\r\nadmiring her. Her conduct toward my son has, I repeat, been the conduct\r\nof an impudent adventuress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose words showed Sir Patrick the utter hopelessness of shaking\r\nher prejudice against Anne. He decided on proceeding at once to the\r\ndisclosure of the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI entreat you so say no more,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYour ladyship is speaking\r\nof your son\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy son has married Miss Silvester?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned deadly pale. It appeared, for an instant, as if the shock had\r\ncompletely overwhelmed her. But the mother\xe2\x80\x99s weakness was only momentary\r\nThe virtuous indignation of the great lady had taken its place before\r\nSir Patrick could speak again. She rose to terminate the interview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI presume,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat your errand here is as an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick rose, on his side, resolute to do the duty which had brought\r\nhim to the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am compelled to trespass on your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s attention for a few\r\nminutes more,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThe circumstances attending the marriage of\r\nMr. Geoffrey Delamayn are of no common importance. I beg permission (in\r\nthe interests of his family) to state, very briefly, what they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a few clear sentences he narrated what had happened, that afternoon,\r\nin Portland Place. Lady Holchester listened with the steadiest and\r\ncoldest attention. So far as outward appearances were concerned, no\r\nimpression was produced upon her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you expect me,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cto espouse the interests of a person who\r\nhas prevented my son from marrying the lady of his choice, and of mine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Geoffrey Delamayn, unhappily, has that reason for resenting his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s innocent interference with interests of considerable, importance\r\nto him,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cI request your ladyship to consider\r\nwhether it is desirable--in view of your son\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in the future--to\r\nallow his wife to stand in the doubly perilous relation toward him of\r\nbeing also a cause of estrangement between his father and himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had put it with scrupulous caution. But Lady Holchester understood\r\nwhat he had refrained from saving as well as what he had actually said.\r\nShe had hitherto remained standing--she now sat down again. There was a\r\nvisible impression produced on her at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Lord Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s critical state of health,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndecline to take the responsibility of telling him what you have just\r\ntold me. My own influence has been uniformly exerted in my son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfavor--as long as my interference could be productive of any good\r\nresult. The time for my interference has passed. Lord Holchester has\r\naltered his will this morning. I was not present; and I have not yet\r\nbeen informed of what has been done. Even if I knew--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour ladyship would naturally decline,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\ncommunicate the information to a stranger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. At the same time, after what you have said, I do not feel\r\njustified in deciding on this matter entirely by myself. One of Lord\r\nHolchester\xe2\x80\x99s executors is now in the house. There can be no impropriety\r\nin your seeing him--if you wish it. You are at liberty to say, from me,\r\nthat I leave it entirely to his discretion to decide what ought to be\r\ndone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gladly accept your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s proposal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Holchester rang the bell at her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake Sir Patrick Lundie to Mr. Marchwood,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to the servant.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick started. The name was familiar to him, as the name of a\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Marchwood of Hurlbeck?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that brief answer, Lady Holchester dismissed her visitor. Following\r\nthe servant to the other end of the corridor, Sir Patrick was conducted\r\ninto a small room--the ante-chamber to the bedroom in which Lord\r\nHolchester lay. The door of communication was closed. A gentleman sat\r\nwriting at a table near the window. He rose, and held out his hand, with\r\na look of surprise, when the servant announced Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s name. This\r\nwas Mr. Marchwood.\r\n\r\nAfter the first explanations had been given, Sir Patrick patiently\r\nreverted to the object of his visit to Holchester House. On the first\r\noccasion when he mentioned Anne\xe2\x80\x99s name he observed that Mr. Marchwood\r\nbecame, from that moment, specially interested in what he was saying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you happen to be acquainted with the lady?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only know her as the cause of a very strange proceeding, this\r\nmorning, in that room.\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed to Lord Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom as he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you at liberty to mention what the proceeding was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHardly--even to an old friend like you--unless I felt it a matter of\r\nduty, on my part, to state the circumstances. Pray go on with what you\r\nwere saying to me. You were on the point of telling me what brought you\r\nto this house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout a word more of preface, Sir Patrick told him the news of\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s marriage to Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarried!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Marchwood. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure of what you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am one of the witnesses of the marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood Heavens! And Lord Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer has left the house!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I replace him? Have I, by any chance justified you in telling me\r\nwhat happened this morning in the next room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJustified me? You have left me no other alternative. The doctors are\r\nall agreed in dreading apoplexy--his lordship may die at any moment.\r\nIn the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s absence, I must take it on myself. Here are the facts.\r\nThere is the codicil to Lord Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s Will which is still unsigned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRelating to his second son?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRelating to Geoffrey Delamayn, and giving him (when it is once\r\nexecuted) a liberal provision for life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the object in the way of his executing it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lady whom you have just mentioned to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne Silvester!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnne Silvester--now (as you tell me) Mrs. Geoffrey Delamayn. I can\r\nonly explain the thing very imperfectly. There are certain painful\r\ncircumstances associated in his lordship\xe2\x80\x99s memory with this lady,\r\nor with some member of her family. We can only gather that he did\r\nsomething--in the early part of his professional career--which was\r\nstrictly within the limits of his duty, but which apparently led to very\r\nsad results. Some days since he unfortunately heard (either through Mrs.\r\nGlenarm or through Mrs. Julius Delamayn) of Miss Silvester\xe2\x80\x99s appearance\r\nat Swanhaven Lodge. No remark on the subject escaped him at the time.\r\nIt was only this morning, when the codicil giving the legacy to Geoffrey\r\nwas waiting to be executed, that his real feeling in the matter came\r\nout. To our astonishment, he refused to sign it. \xe2\x80\x98Find Anne Silvester\xe2\x80\x99\r\n(was the only answer we could get from him); \xe2\x80\x98and bring her to my\r\nbedside. You all say my son is guiltless of injuring her. I am lying on\r\nmy death-bed. I have serious reasons of my own--I owe it to the memory\r\nof the dead--to assure myself of the truth. If Anne Silvester herself\r\nacquits him of having wronged her, I will provide for Geoffrey. Not\r\notherwise.\xe2\x80\x99 We went the length of reminding him that he might die before\r\nMiss Silvester could be found. Our interference had but one result.\r\nHe desired the lawyer to add a second codicil to the Will--which he\r\nexecuted on the spot. It directs his executors to inquire into the\r\nrelations that have actually existed between Anne Silvester and his\r\nyounger son. If we find reason to conclude that Geoffrey has gravely\r\nwronged her, we are directed to pay her a legacy--provided that she is a\r\nsingle woman at the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd her marriage violates the provision!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. The codicil actually executed is now worthless. And the other\r\ncodicil remains unsigned until the lawyer can produce Miss Silvester. He\r\nhas left the house to apply to Geoffrey at Fulham, as the only means at\r\nour disposal of finding the lady. Some hours have passed--and he has not\r\nyet returned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is useless to wait for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile the lawyer was\r\non his way to Fulham, Lord Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s son was on his way to Portland\r\nPlace. This is even more serious than you suppose. Tell me, what under\r\nless pressing circumstances I should have no right to ask. Apart from\r\nthe unexecuted codicil what is Geoffrey Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s position in the\r\nwill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not even mentioned in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got the will?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Marchwood unlocked a drawer, and took it out.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick instantly rose from his chair. \xe2\x80\x9cNo waiting for the lawyer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he repeated, vehemently. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a matter of life and death. Lady\r\nHolchester bitterly resents her son\xe2\x80\x99s marriage. She speaks and feels as\r\na friend of Mrs. Glenarm. Do you think Lord Holchester would take the\r\nsame view if he knew of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt depends entirely on the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose I informed him--as I inform you in confidence--that his son\r\n_has_ gravely wronged Miss Silvester? And suppose I followed that up by\r\ntelling him that his son has made atonement by marrying her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the feeling that he has shown in the matter, I believe he would\r\nsign the codicil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, let me see him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must speak to the doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo it instantly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith the will in his hand, Mr. Marchwood advanced to the bedroom door.\r\nIt was opened from within before he could get to it. The doctor appeared\r\non the threshold. He held up his hand warningly when Mr. Marchwood\r\nattempted to speak to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo to Lady Holchester,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTEENTH SCENE.--SALT PATCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FORTY-EIGHTH.\r\n\r\nTHE PLACE.\r\n\r\nEARLY in the present century it was generally reported among the\r\nneighbors of one Reuben Limbrick that he was in a fair way to make a\r\ncomfortable little fortune by dealing in Salt.\r\n\r\nHis place of abode was in Staffordshire, on a morsel of freehold land\r\nof his own--appropriately called Salt Patch. Without being absolutely\r\na miser, he lived in the humblest manner, saw very little company;\r\nskillfully invested his money; and persisted in remaining a single man.\r\n\r\nToward eighteen hundred and forty he first felt the approach of the\r\nchronic malady which ultimately terminated his life. After trying what\r\nthe medical men of his own locality could do for him, with very poor\r\nsuccess, he met by accident with a doctor living in the western\r\nsuburbs of London, who thoroughly understood his complaint. After some\r\njourneying backward and forward to consult this gentleman, he decided\r\non retiring from business, and on taking up his abode within an easy\r\ndistance of his medical man.\r\n\r\nFinding a piece of freehold land to be sold in the neighborhood of\r\nFulham, he bought it, and had a cottage residence built on it, under his\r\nown directions. He surrounded the whole--being a man singularly jealous\r\nof any intrusion on his retirement, or of any chance observation of his\r\nways and habits--with a high wall, which cost a large sum of money,\r\nand which was rightly considered a dismal and hideous object by the\r\nneighbors. When the new residence was completed, he called it after\r\nthe name of the place in Staffordshire where he had made his money,\r\nand where he had lived during the happiest period of his life. His\r\nrelatives, failing to understand that a question of sentiment was\r\ninvolved in this proceeding, appealed to hard facts, and reminded him\r\nthat there were no salt mines in the neighborhood. Reuben Limbrick\r\nanswered, \xe2\x80\x9cSo much the worse for the neighborhood\xe2\x80\x9d--and persisted in\r\ncalling his property, \xe2\x80\x9cSalt Patch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cottage was so small that it looked quite lost in the large garden\r\nall round it. There was a ground-floor and a floor above it--and that\r\nwas all.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the passage, on the lower floor, were two rooms. At\r\nthe right-hand side, on entering by the front-door, there was a kitchen,\r\nwith its outhouses attached. The room next to the kitchen looked into\r\nthe garden. In Reuben Limbrick\xe2\x80\x99s time it was called the study\r\nand contained a small collection of books and a large store of\r\nfishing-tackle. On the left-hand side of the passage there was a\r\ndrawing-room situated at the back of the house, and communicating with\r\na dining-room in the front. On the upper floor there were five\r\nbedrooms--two on one side of the passage, corresponding in size with the\r\ndining-room and the drawing-room below, but not opening into each other;\r\nthree on the other side of the passage, consisting of one larger room\r\nin front, and of two small rooms at the back. All these were solidly and\r\ncompletely furnished. Money had not been spared, and workmanship had not\r\nbeen stinted. It was all substantial--and, up stairs and down stairs, it\r\nwas all ugly.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Salt Patch was lonely. The lands of the\r\nmarket-gardeners separated it from other houses. Jealously surrounded\r\nby its own high walls, the cottage suggested, even to the most\r\nunimaginative persons, the idea of an asylum or a prison. Reuben\r\nLimbrick\xe2\x80\x99s relatives, occasionally coming to stay with him, found the\r\nplace prey on their spirits, and rejoiced when the time came for going\r\nhome again. They were never pressed to stay against their will. Reuben\r\nLimbrick was not a hospitable or a sociable man. He set very little\r\nvalue on human sympathy, in his attacks of illness; and he bore\r\ncongratulations impatiently, in his intervals of health. \xe2\x80\x9cI care about\r\nnothing but fishing,\xe2\x80\x9d he used to say. \xe2\x80\x9cI find my dog very good company.\r\nAnd I am quite happy as long as I am free from pain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn his death-bed, he divided his money justly enough among his\r\nrelations. The only part of his Will which exposed itself to unfavorable\r\ncriticism, was a clause conferring a legacy on one of his sisters (then\r\na widow) who had estranged herself from her family by marrying beneath\r\nher. The family agreed in considering this unhappy person as undeserving\r\nof notice or benefit. Her name was Hester Dethridge. It proved to be\r\na great aggravation of Hester\xe2\x80\x99s offenses, in the eyes of Hester\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrelatives, when it was discovered that she possessed a life-interest in\r\nSalt Patch, and an income of two hundred a year.\r\n\r\nNot visited by the surviving members of her family, living, literally,\r\nby herself in the world, Hester decided, in spite of her comfortable\r\nlittle income, on letting lodgings. The explanation of this strange\r\nconduct which she had written on her slate, in reply to an inquiry from\r\nAnne, was the true one. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not got a friend in the world: I dare\r\nnot live alone.\xe2\x80\x9d In that desolate situation, and with that melancholy\r\nmotive, she put the house into an agent\xe2\x80\x99s hands. The first person in\r\nwant of lodgings whom the agent sent to see the place was Perry the\r\ntrainer; and Hester\xe2\x80\x99s first tenant was Geoffrey Delamayn.\r\n\r\nThe rooms which the landlady reserved for herself were the kitchen, the\r\nroom next to it, which had once been her brother\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstudy,\xe2\x80\x9d and the\r\ntwo small back bedrooms up stairs--one for herself, the other for the\r\nservant-girl whom she employed to help her. The whole of the rest of\r\nthe cottage was to let. It was more than the trainer wanted; but Hester\r\nDethridge refused to dispose of her lodgings--either as to the rooms\r\noccupied, or as to the period for which they were to be taken--on other\r\nthan her own terms. Perry had no alternative but to lose the advantage\r\nof the garden as a private training-ground, or to submit.\r\n\r\nBeing only two in number, the lodgers had three bedrooms to choose from.\r\nGeoffrey established himself in the back-room, over the drawing-room.\r\nPerry chose the front-room, placed on the other side of the cottage,\r\nnext to the two smaller apartments occupied by Hester and her maid.\r\nUnder this arrangement, the front bedroom, on the opposite side of the\r\npassage--next to the room in which Geoffrey slept--was left empty, and\r\nwas called, for the time being, the spare room. As for the lower floor,\r\nthe athlete and his trainer ate their meals in the dining-room; and left\r\nthe drawing-room, as a needless luxury, to take care of itself.\r\n\r\nThe Foot-Race once over, Perry\xe2\x80\x99s business at the cottage was at an end.\r\nHis empty bedroom became a second spare room. The term for which the\r\nlodgings had been taken was then still unexpired. On the day after the\r\nrace Geoffrey had to choose between sacrificing the money, or remaining\r\nin the lodgings by himself, with two spare bedrooms on his hands, and\r\nwith a drawing-room for the reception of his visitors--who called with\r\npipes in their mouths, and whose idea of hospitality was a pot of beer\r\nin the garden.\r\n\r\nTo use his own phrase, he was \xe2\x80\x9cout of sorts.\xe2\x80\x9d A sluggish reluctance to\r\nface change of any kind possessed him. He decided on staying at Salt\r\nPatch until his marriage to Mrs. Glenarm (which he then looked upon as\r\na certainty) obliged him to alter his habits completely, once for all.\r\nFrom Fulham he had gone, the next day, to attend the inquiry in Portland\r\nPlace. And to Fulham he returned, when he brought the wife who had been\r\nforced upon him to her \xe2\x80\x9chome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch was the position of the tenant, and such were the arrangements\r\nof the interior of the cottage, on the memorable evening when Anne\r\nSilvester entered it as Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s wife.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FORTY-NINTH.\r\n\r\nTHE NIGHT.\r\n\r\nON leaving Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s house, Geoffrey called the first empty cab that\r\npassed him. He opened the door, and signed to Anne to enter the vehicle.\r\nShe obeyed him mechanically. He placed himself on the seat opposite to\r\nher, and told the man to drive to Fulham.\r\n\r\nThe cab started on its journey; husband and wife preserving absolute\r\nsilence. Anne laid her head back wearily, and closed her eyes. Her\r\nstrength had broken down under the effort which had sustained her from\r\nthe beginning to the end of the inquiry. Her power of thinking was gone.\r\nShe felt nothing, knew nothing, feared nothing. Half in faintness, half\r\nin slumber, she had lost all sense of her own terrible position before\r\nthe first five minutes of the journey to Fulham had come to an end.\r\n\r\nSitting opposite to her, savagely self-concentrated in his own thoughts,\r\nGeoffrey roused himself on a sudden. An idea had sprung to life in\r\nhis sluggish brain. He put his head out of the window of the cab, and\r\ndirected the driver to turn back, and go to an hotel near the Great\r\nNorthern Railway.\r\n\r\nResuming his seat, he looked furtively at Anne. She neither moved nor\r\nopened her eyes--she was, to all appearance, unconscious of what had\r\nhappened. He observed her attentively. Was she really ill? Was the\r\ntime coming when he would be freed from her? He pondered over that\r\nquestion--watching her closely. Little by little the vile hope in him\r\nslowly died away, and a vile suspicion took its place. What, if this\r\nappearance of illness was a pretense? What, if she was waiting to throw\r\nhim off his guard, and escape from him at the first opportunity? He put\r\nhis head out of the window again, and gave another order to the driver.\r\nThe cab diverged from the direct route, and stopped at a public house in\r\nHolborn, kept (under an assumed name) by Perry the trainer.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey wrote a line in pencil on his card, and sent it into the house\r\nby the driver. After waiting some minutes, a lad appeared and touched\r\nhis hat. Geoffrey spoke to him, out of the window, in an under-tone. The\r\nlad took his place on the box by the driver. The cab turned back, and\r\ntook the road to the hotel near the Great Northern Railway.\r\n\r\nArrived at the place, Geoffrey posted the lad close at the door of the\r\ncab, and pointed to Anne, still reclining with closed eyes; still, as it\r\nseemed, too weary to lift her head, too faint to notice any thing that\r\nhappened. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she attempts to get out, stop her, and send for me.\xe2\x80\x9d With\r\nthose parting directions he entered the hotel, and asked for Mr. Moy.\r\n\r\nMr. Moy was in the house; he had just returned from Portland Place. He\r\nrose, and bowed coldly, when Geoffrey was shown into his sitting-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your business with me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had a notion come into my head,\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I want to\r\nspeak to you about it directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must request you to consult some one else. Consider me, if you\r\nplease, as having withdrawn from all further connection with your\r\naffairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey looked at him in stolid surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say you\xe2\x80\x99re going to leave me in the lurch?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to say that I will take no fresh step in any business of yours,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n answered Mr. Moy, firmly. \xe2\x80\x9cAs to the future, I have ceased to be your\r\nlegal adviser. As to the past, I shall carefully complete the formal\r\nduties toward you which remain to be done. Mrs. Inchbare and Bishopriggs\r\nare coming here by appointment, at six this evening, to receive the\r\nmoney due to them before they go back. I shall return to Scotland myself\r\nby the night mail. The persons referred to, in the matter of the promise\r\nof marriage, by Sir Patrick, are all in Scotland. I will take their\r\nevidence as to the handwriting, and as to the question of residence in\r\nthe North--and I will send it to you in written form. That done, I shall\r\nhave done all. I decline to advise you in any future step which you\r\npropose to take.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter reflecting for a moment, Geoffrey put a last question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said Bishopriggs and the woman would be here at six this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are they to be found before that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Moy wrote a few words on a slip of paper, and handed it to Geoffrey.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt their lodgings,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is the address.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey took the address, and left the room. Lawyer and client parted\r\nwithout a word on either side.\r\n\r\nReturning to the cab, Geoffrey found the lad steadily waiting at his\r\npost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas any thing happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lady hasn\xe2\x80\x99t moved, Sir, since you left her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Perry at the public house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at this time, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want a lawyer. Do you know who Perry\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where he is to be found?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up on the box, and tell the man where to drive to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe cab went on again along the Euston Road, and stopped at a house in\r\na side-street, with a professional brass plate on the door. The lad got\r\ndown, and came to the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is, Sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnock at the door, and see if he is at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe proved to be at home. Geoffrey entered the house, leaving his\r\nemissary once more on the watch. The lad noticed that the lady moved\r\nthis time. She shivered as if she felt cold--opened her eyes for a\r\nmoment wearily, and looked out through the window--sighed, and sank back\r\nagain in the corner of the cab.\r\n\r\nAfter an absence of more than half an hour Geoffrey came out again.\r\nHis interview with Perry\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer appeared to have relieved his mind of\r\nsomething that had oppressed it. He once more ordered the driver to\r\ngo to Fulham--opened the door to get into the cab--then, as it seemed,\r\nsuddenly recollected himself--and, calling the lad down from the box,\r\nordered him to get inside, and took his place by the driver.\r\n\r\nAs the cab started he looked over his shoulder at Anne through the front\r\nwindow. \xe2\x80\x9cWell worth trying,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the way to be\r\neven with her. And it\xe2\x80\x99s the way to be free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey arrived at the cottage. Possibly, repose had restored Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstrength. Possibly, the sight of the place had roused the instinct of\r\nself-preservation in her at last. To Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s surprise, she left the\r\ncab without assistance. When he opened the wooden gate, with his own\r\nkey, she recoiled from it, and looked at him for the first time.\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the entrance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn what terms?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, without stirring a step.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey dismissed the cab; and sent the lad in, to wait for further\r\norders. These things done, he answered her loudly and brutally the\r\nmoment they were alone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn any terms I please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing will induce me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, firmly, \xe2\x80\x9cto live with you as your\r\nwife. You may kill me--but you will never bend me to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe advanced a step--opened his lips--and suddenly checked himself. He\r\nwaited a while, turning something over in his mind. When he spoke again,\r\nit was with marked deliberation and constraint--with the air of a man\r\nwho was repeating words put into his lips, or words prepared beforehand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have something to tell you in the presence of witnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t ask you, or wish you, to see me in the cottage alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started at the change in him. His sudden composure, and his sudden\r\nnicety in the choice of words, tried her courage far more severely than\r\nit had been tried by his violence of the moment before.\r\n\r\nHe waited her decision, still pointing through the gate. She trembled\r\na little--steadied herself again--and went in. The lad, waiting in the\r\nfront garden, followed her.\r\n\r\nHe threw open the drawing-room door, on the left-hand side of the\r\npassage. She entered the room. The servant-girl appeared. He said to\r\nher, \xe2\x80\x9cFetch Mrs. Dethridge; and come back with her yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he\r\nwent into the room; the lad, by his own directions, following him in;\r\nand the door being left wide open.\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge came out from the kitchen with the girl behind her. At\r\nthe sight of Anne, a faint and momentary change passed over the stony\r\nstillness of her face. A dull light glimmered in her eyes. She slowly\r\nnodded her head. A dumb sound, vaguely expressive of something like\r\nexultation or relief, escaped her lips.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey spoke--once more, with marked deliberation and constraint;\r\nonce more, with the air of repeating something which had been prepared\r\nbeforehand. He pointed to Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis woman is my wife,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the presence of you three, as\r\nwitnesses, I tell her that I don\xe2\x80\x99t forgive her. I have brought her\r\nhere--having no other place in which I can trust her to be--to wait the\r\nissue of proceedings, undertaken in defense of my own honor and good\r\nname. While she stays here, she will live separate from me, in a room of\r\nher own. If it is necessary for me to communicate with her, I shall only\r\nsee her in the presence of a third person. Do you all understand me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge bowed her head. The other two answered, \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d--and\r\nturned to go out.\r\n\r\nAnne rose. At a sign from Geoffrey, the servant and the lad waited in\r\nthe room to hear what she had to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing in my conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, addressing herself to\r\nGeoffrey, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich justifies you in telling these people that you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nforgive me. Those words applied by you to me are an insult. I am equally\r\nignorant of what you mean when you speak of defending your good name.\r\nAll I understand is, that we are separate persons in this house, and\r\nthat I am to have a room of my own. I am grateful, whatever your motives\r\nmay be, for the arrangement that you have proposed. Direct one of these\r\ntwo women to show me my room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey turned to Hester Dethridge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake her up stairs,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cand let her pick which room she pleases.\r\nGive her what she wants to eat or drink. Bring down the address of the\r\nplace where her luggage is. The lad here will go back by railway, and\r\nfetch it. That\xe2\x80\x99s all. Be off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester went out. Anne followed her up the stairs. In the passage on the\r\nupper floor she stopped. The dull light flickered again for a moment\r\nin her eyes. She wrote on her slate, and held it up to Anne, with these\r\nwords on it: \xe2\x80\x9cI knew you would come back. It\xe2\x80\x99s not over yet between\r\nyou and him.\xe2\x80\x9d Anne made no reply. She went on writing, with something\r\nfaintly like a smile on her thin, colorless lips. \xe2\x80\x9cI know something of\r\nbad husbands. Yours is as bad a one as ever stood in shoes. He\xe2\x80\x99ll try\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d Anne made an effort to stop her. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see how tired I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said, gently. Hester Dethridge dropped the slate--looked with a\r\nsteady and uncompassionate attention in Anne\xe2\x80\x99s face--nodded her head,\r\nas much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI see it now\xe2\x80\x9d--and led the way into one of the empty\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\nIt was the front bedroom, over the drawing-room. The first glance\r\nround showed it to be scrupulously clean, and solidly and tastelessly\r\nfurnished. The hideous paper on the walls, the hideous carpet on the\r\nfloor, were both of the best quality. The great heavy mahogany bedstead,\r\nwith its curtains hanging from a hook in the ceiling, and with its\r\nclumsily carved head and foot on the same level, offered to the view the\r\nanomalous spectacle of French design overwhelmed by English execution.\r\nThe most noticeable thing in the room was the extraordinary attention\r\nwhich had been given to the defense of the door. Besides the usual lock\r\nand key, it possessed two solid bolts, fastening inside at the top and\r\nthe bottom. It had been one among the many eccentric sides of Reuben\r\nLimbrick\xe2\x80\x99s character to live in perpetual dread of thieves breaking into\r\nhis cottage at night. All the outer doors and all the window shutters\r\nwere solidly sheathed with iron, and had alarm-bells attached to them\r\non a new principle. Every one of the bedrooms possessed its two bolts\r\non the inner side of the door. And, to crown all, on the roof of the\r\ncottage was a little belfry, containing a bell large enough to make\r\nitself heard at the Fulham police station. In Reuben Limbrick\xe2\x80\x99s time the\r\nrope had communicated with his bedroom. It hung now against the wall, in\r\nthe passage outside.\r\n\r\nLooking from one to the other of the objects around her, Anne\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\nrested on the partition wall which divided the room from the room\r\nnext to it. The wall was not broken by a door of communication, it had\r\nnothing placed against it but a wash-hand-stand and two chairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho sleeps in the next room?\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne.\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge pointed down to the drawing-room in which they had left\r\nGeoffrey, Geoffrey slept in the room.\r\n\r\nAnne led the way out again into the passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow me the second room,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThe second room was also in front of the house. More ugliness (of\r\nfirst-rate quality) in the paper and the carpet. Another heavy mahogany\r\nbedstead; but, this time, a bedstead with a canopy attached to the head\r\nof it--supporting its own curtains. Anticipating Anne\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry, on\r\nthis occasion, Hester looked toward the next room, at the back of the\r\ncottage, and pointed to herself. Anne at once decided on choosing the\r\nsecond room; it was the farthest from Geoffrey. Hester waited while she\r\nwrote the address at which her luggage would be found (at the house\r\nof the musical agent), and then, having applied for, and received her\r\ndirections as to the evening meal which she should send up stairs,\r\nquitted the room.\r\n\r\nLeft alone, Anne secured the door, and threw herself on the bed. Still\r\ntoo weary to exert her mind, still physically incapable of realizing\r\nthe helplessness and the peril of her position, she opened a locket that\r\nhung from her neck, kissed the portrait of her mother and the portrait\r\nof Blanche placed opposite to each other inside it, and sank into a deep\r\nand dreamless sleep.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Geoffrey repeated his final orders to the lad, at the cottage\r\ngate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have got the luggage, you are to go to the lawyer. If he can\r\ncome here to-night, you will show him the way. If he can\xe2\x80\x99t come, you\r\nwill bring me a letter from him. Make any mistake in this, and it will\r\nbe the worst day\xe2\x80\x99s work you ever did in your life. Away with you, and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t lose the train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lad ran off. Geoffrey waited, looking after him, and turning over in\r\nhis mind what had been done up to that time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, so far,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t ride in the cab with\r\nher. I told her before witnesses I didn\xe2\x80\x99t forgive her, and why I had\r\nher in the house. I\xe2\x80\x99ve put her in a room by herself. And if I _must_ see\r\nher, I see her with Hester Dethridge for a witness. My part\xe2\x80\x99s done--let\r\nthe lawyer do his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe strolled round into the back garden, and lit his pipe. After a while,\r\nas the twilight faded, he saw a light in Hester\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room on the\r\nground-floor. He went to the window. Hester and the servant-girl were\r\nboth there at work. \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHow about the woman up stairs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Hester\xe2\x80\x99s slate, aided by the girl\xe2\x80\x99s tongue, told him all about \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x9d that was to be told. They had taken up to her room tea and an\r\nomelet; and they had been obliged to wake her from a sleep. She had\r\neaten a little of the omelet, and had drunk eagerly of the tea. They had\r\ngone up again to take the tray down. She had returned to the bed. She\r\nwas not asleep--only dull and heavy. Made no remark. Looked clean worn\r\nout. We left her a light; and we let her be. Such was the report. After\r\nlistening to it, without making any remark, Geoffrey filled a second\r\npipe, and resumed his walk. The time wore on. It began to feel chilly in\r\nthe garden. The rising wind swept audibly over the open lands round the\r\ncottage; the stars twinkled their last; nothing was to be seen overhead\r\nbut the black void of night. More rain coming. Geoffrey went indoors.\r\n\r\nAn evening newspaper was on the dining-room table. The candles were lit.\r\nHe sat down, and tried to read. No! There was nothing in the newspaper\r\nthat he cared about. The time for hearing from the lawyer was drawing\r\nnearer and nearer. Reading was of no use. Sitting still was of no use.\r\nHe got up, and went out in the front of the cottage--strolled to the\r\ngate--opened it--and looked idly up and down the road.\r\n\r\nBut one living creature was visible by the light of the gas-lamp over\r\nthe gate. The creature came nearer, and proved to be the postman going\r\nhis last round, with the last delivery for the night. He came up to the\r\ngate with a letter in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Honorable Geoffrey Delamayn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took the letter from the postman, and went back into the dining-room.\r\nLooking at the address by the light of the candles, he recognized the\r\nhandwriting of Mrs. Glenarm. \xe2\x80\x9cTo congratulate me on my marriage!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid to himself, bitterly, and opened the letter.\r\n\r\nMrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s congratulations were expressed in these terms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY ADORED GEOFFREY,--I have heard all. My beloved one! my own! you are\r\nsacrificed to the vilest wretch that walks the earth, and I have lost\r\nyou! How is it that I live after hearing it? How is it that I can think,\r\nand write, with my brain on fire, and my heart broken! Oh, my angel,\r\nthere is a purpose that supports me--pure, beautiful, worthy of us both.\r\nI live, Geoffrey--I live to dedicate myself to the adored idea of You.\r\nMy hero! my first, last, love! I will marry no other man. I will live\r\nand die--I vow it solemnly on my bended knees--I will live and die true\r\nto You. I am your Spiritual Wife. My beloved Geoffrey! _she_ can\xe2\x80\x99t come\r\nbetween us, there--_she_ can never rob you of my heart\xe2\x80\x99s unalterable\r\nfidelity, of my soul\xe2\x80\x99s unearthly devotion. I am your Spiritual Wife! Oh,\r\nthe blameless luxury of writing those words! Write back to me, beloved\r\none, and say you feel it too. Vow it, idol of my heart, as I have vowed\r\nit. Unalterable fidelity! unearthly devotion! Never, never will I be\r\nthe wife of any other man! Never, never will I forgive the woman who has\r\ncome between us! Yours ever and only; yours with the stainless passion\r\nthat burns on the altar of the heart; yours, yours, yours--E. G.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis outbreak of hysterical nonsense--in itself simply\r\nridiculous--assumed a serious importance in its effect on Geoffrey.\r\nIt associated the direct attainment of his own interests with\r\nthe gratification of his vengeance on Anne. Ten thousand a year\r\nself-dedicated to him--and nothing to prevent his putting out his hand\r\nand taking it but the woman who had caught him in her trap, the woman up\r\nstairs who had fastened herself on him for life!\r\n\r\nHe put the letter into his pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cWait till I hear from the lawyer,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cThe easiest way out of it is _that_ way. And it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked impatiently at his watch. As he put it back again in his\r\npocket there was a ring at the bell. Was it the lad bringing the\r\nluggage? Yes. And, with it, the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s report? No. Better than\r\nthat--the lawyer himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Geoffrey, meeting his visitor at the door.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer entered the dining-room. The candle-light revealed to view a\r\ncorpulent, full-lipped, bright-eyed man--with a strain of negro blood in\r\nhis yellow face, and with unmistakable traces in his look and manner of\r\nwalking habitually in the dirtiest professional by-ways of the law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a little place of my own in your neighborhood,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nI thought I would look in myself, Mr. Delamayn, on my way home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen the witnesses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have examined them both, Sir. First, Mrs. Inchbare and Mr.\r\nBishopriggs together. Next, Mrs. Inchbare and Mr. Bishopriggs\r\nseparately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Sir, the result is unfavorable, I am sorry to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither the one nor the other of them, Mr. Delamayn, can give the\r\nevidence we want. I have made sure of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMade sure of that? You have made an infernal mess of it! You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand the case!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe mulatto lawyer smiled. The rudeness of his client appeared only to\r\namuse him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you tell me where I am wrong about it? Here\r\nit is in outline only. On the fourteenth of August last your wife was\r\nat an inn in Scotland. A gentleman named Arnold Brinkworth joined her\r\nthere. He represented himself to be her husband, and he staid with her\r\ntill the next morning. Starting from those facts, the object you have\r\nin view is to sue for a Divorce from your wife. You make Mr. Arnold\r\nBrinkworth the co-respondent. And you produce in evidence the waiter and\r\nthe landlady of the inn. Any thing wrong, Sir, so far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing wrong. At one cowardly stroke to cast Anne disgraced on the\r\nworld, and to set himself free--there, plainly and truly stated, was\r\nthe scheme which he had devised, when he had turned back on the way to\r\nFulham to consult Mr. Moy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much for the case,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the lawyer. \xe2\x80\x9cNow for what I have done on\r\nreceiving your instructions. I have examined the witnesses; and I have\r\nhad an interview (not a very pleasant one) with Mr. Moy. The result of\r\nthose two proceedings is briefly this. First discovery: In assuming the\r\ncharacter of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s husband Mr. Brinkworth was acting under your\r\ndirections--which tells dead against _you._ Second discovery: Not the\r\nslightest impropriety of conduct, not an approach even to harmless\r\nfamiliarity, was detected by either of the witnesses, while the lady and\r\ngentleman were together at the inn. There is literally no evidence to\r\nproduce against them, except that they _were_ together--in two rooms.\r\nHow are you to assume a guilty purpose, when you can\xe2\x80\x99t prove an approach\r\nto a guilty act? You can no more take such a case as that into Court\r\nthan you can jump over the roof of this cottage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked hard at his client, expecting to receive a violent reply. His\r\nclient agreeably disappointed him. A very strange impression appeared\r\nto have been produced on this reckless and headstrong man. He got up\r\nquietly; he spoke with perfect outward composure of face and manner when\r\nhe said his next words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you given up the case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs things are at present, Mr. Delamayn, there is no case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd no hope of my getting divorced from her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment. Have your wife and Mr. Brinkworth met nowhere since they\r\nwere together at the Scotch inn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNowhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to the future, of course I can\xe2\x80\x99t say. As to the past, there is no\r\nhope of your getting divorced from her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Mr. Delamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFastened to her for life--and the law powerless to cut the knot.\r\n\r\nHe pondered over that result until he had thoroughly realized it and\r\nfixed it in his mind. Then he took out Mrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and read\r\nit through again, attentively, from beginning to end.\r\n\r\nNothing could shake her devotion to him. Nothing would induce her to\r\nmarry another man. There she was--in her own words--dedicated to him:\r\nwaiting, with her fortune at her own disposal, to be his wife. There\r\nalso was his father, waiting (so far as _he_ knew, in the absence of\r\nany tidings from Holchester House) to welcome Mrs. Glenarm as a\r\ndaughter-in-law, and to give Mrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s husband an income of his\r\nown. As fair a prospect, on all sides, as man could desire. And nothing\r\nin the way of it but the woman who had caught him in her trap--the woman\r\nup stairs who had fastened herself on him for life.\r\n\r\nHe went out in the garden in the darkness of the night.\r\n\r\nThere was open communication, on all sides, between the back garden and\r\nthe front. He walked round and round the cottage--now appearing in a\r\nstream of light from a window; now disappearing again in the darkness.\r\nThe wind blew refreshingly over his bare head. For some minutes he went\r\nround and round, faster and faster, without a pause. When he stopped\r\nat last, it was in front of the cottage. He lifted his head slowly, and\r\nlooked up at the dim light in the window of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the question. How?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went indoors again, and rang the bell. The servant-girl who answered\r\nit started back at the sight of him. His florid color was all gone. His\r\neyes looked at her without appearing to see her. The perspiration was\r\nstanding on his forehead in great heavy drops.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ill, Sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl.\r\n\r\nHe told her, with an oath, to hold her tongue and bring the brandy. When\r\nshe entered the room for the second time, he was standing with his back\r\nto her, looking out at the night. He never moved when she put the bottle\r\non the table. She heard him muttering as if he was talking to himself.\r\n\r\nThe same difficulty which had been present to his mind in secret under\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s window was present to his mind still.\r\n\r\nHow? That was the problem to solve. How?\r\n\r\nHe turned to the brandy, and took counsel of that.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIFTIETH.\r\n\r\nTHE MORNING.\r\n\r\nWHEN does the vain regret find its keenest sting? When is the doubtful\r\nfuture blackened by its darkest cloud? When is life least worth having,\r\nand death oftenest at the bedside? In the terrible morning hours,\r\nwhen the sun is rising in its glory, and the birds are singing in the\r\nstillness of the new-born day.\r\n\r\nAnne woke in the strange bed, and looked round her, by the light of the\r\nnew morning, at the strange room.\r\n\r\nThe rain had all fallen in the night. The sun was master in the clear\r\nautumn sky. She rose, and opened the window. The fresh morning air, keen\r\nand fragrant, filled the room. Far and near, the same bright stillness\r\npossessed the view. She stood at the window looking out. Her mind was\r\nclear again--she could think, she could feel; she could face the one\r\nlast question which the merciless morning now forced on her--How will it\r\nend?\r\n\r\nWas there any hope?--hope for instance, in what she might do for\r\nherself. What can a married woman do for herself? She can make her\r\nmisery public--provided it be misery of a certain kind--and can reckon\r\nsingle-handed with Society when she has done it. Nothing more.\r\n\r\nWas there hope in what others might do for her? Blanche might write to\r\nher--might even come and see her--if her husband allowed it; and that\r\nwas all. Sir Patrick had pressed her hand at parting, and had told her\r\nto rely on him. He was the firmest, the truest of friends. But what\r\ncould he do? There were outrages which her husband was privileged to\r\ncommit, under the sanction of marriage, at the bare thought of which her\r\nblood ran cold. Could Sir Patrick protect her? Absurd! Law and Society\r\narmed her husband with his conjugal rights. Law and Society had but one\r\nanswer to give, if she appealed to them--You are his wife.\r\n\r\nNo hope in herself; no hope in her friends; no hope any where on earth.\r\nNothing to be done but to wait for the end--with faith in the Divine\r\nMercy; with faith in the better world.\r\n\r\nShe took out of her trunk a little book of Prayers and Meditations--worn\r\nwith much use--which had once belonged to her mother. She sat by the\r\nwindow reading it. Now and then she looked up from it--thinking. The\r\nparallel between her mother\xe2\x80\x99s position and her own position was now\r\ncomplete. Both married to husbands who hated them; to husbands whose\r\ninterests pointed to mercenary alliances with other women; to husbands\r\nwhose one want and one purpose was to be free from their wives. Strange,\r\nwhat different ways had led mother and daughter both to the same\r\nfate! Would the parallel hold to the end? \xe2\x80\x9cShall I die,\xe2\x80\x9d she wondered,\r\nthinking of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s last moments, \xe2\x80\x9cin Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s arms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe time had passed unheeded. The morning movement in the house had\r\nfailed to catch her ear. She was first called out of herself to the\r\nsense of the present and passing events by the voice of the servant-girl\r\noutside the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe master wants you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, down stairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rose instantly and put away the little book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all the message?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, opening the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe followed the girl down stairs; recalling to her memory the strange\r\nwords addressed to her by Geoffrey, in the presence of the servants, on\r\nthe evening before. Was she now to know what those words really meant?\r\nThe doubt would soon be set at rest. \xe2\x80\x9cBe the trial what it may,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nthought to herself, \xe2\x80\x9clet me bear it as my mother would have borne it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant opened the door of the dining-room. Breakfast was on\r\nthe table. Geoffrey was standing at the window. Hester Dethridge\r\nwas waiting, posted near the door. He came forward--with the nearest\r\napproach to gentleness in his manner which she had ever yet seen in\r\nit--he came forward, with a set smile on his lips, and offered her his\r\nhand!\r\n\r\nShe had entered the room, prepared (as she believed) for any thing\r\nthat could happen. She was not prepared for this. She stood speechless,\r\nlooking at him.\r\n\r\nAfter one glance at her, when she came in, Hester Dethridge looked at\r\nhim, too--and from that moment never looked away again, as long as Anne\r\nremained in the room.\r\n\r\nHe broke the silence--in a voice that was not like his own; with a\r\nfurtive restraint in his manner which she had never noticed in it\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you shake hands with your husband,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen your husband\r\nasks you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe mechanically put her hand in his. He dropped it instantly, with a\r\nstart. \xe2\x80\x9cGod! how cold!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. His own hand was burning hot, and\r\nshook incessantly.\r\n\r\nHe pointed to a chair at the head of the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you make the tea?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nShe had given him her hand mechanically; she advanced a step\r\nmechanically--and then stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you prefer breakfasting by yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a minute. I have something to say before you go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe waited. He considered with himself; consulting his memory--visibly,\r\nunmistakably, consulting it before he spoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had the night to think in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe night has made a new\r\nman of me. I beg your pardon for what I said yesterday. I was not myself\r\nyesterday. I talked nonsense yesterday. Please to forget it, and forgive\r\nit. I wish to turn over a new leaf and make amends--make amends for\r\nmy past conduct. It shall be my endeavor to be a good husband. In the\r\npresence of Mrs. Dethridge, I request you to give me a chance. I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nforce your inclinations. We are married--what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of regretting\r\nit? Stay here, as you said yesterday, on your own terms. I wish to make\r\nit up. In the presence of Mrs. Dethridge, I say I wish to make it up. I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t detain you. I request you to think of it. Good-morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said those extraordinary words like a slow boy saying a hard\r\nlesson--his eyes on the ground, his fingers restlessly fastening and\r\nunfastening a button on his waistcoat.\r\n\r\nAnne left the room. In the passage she was obliged to wait, and support\r\nherself against the wall. His unnatural politeness was horrible; his\r\ncarefully asserted repentance chilled her to the soul with dread.\r\nShe had never felt--in the time of his fiercest anger and his foulest\r\nlanguage--the unutterable horror of him that she felt now.\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge came out, closing the door behind her. She looked\r\nattentively at Anne--then wrote on her slate, and held it out, with\r\nthese words on it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne pushed the slate away, and ran up stairs. She fastened the\r\ndoor--and sank into a chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is plotting something against me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sickening, physical sense of dread--entirely new in her experience of\r\nherself--made her shrink from pursuing the question. The sinking at her\r\nheart turned her faint. She went to get the air at the open window.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment there was a ring at the gate bell. Suspicious of any\r\nthing and every thing, she felt a sudden distrust of letting herself be\r\nseen. She drew back behind the curtain and looked out.\r\n\r\nA man-servant, in livery, was let in. He had a letter in his hand.\r\nHe said to the girl as he passed Anne\xe2\x80\x99s window, \xe2\x80\x9cI come from Lady\r\nHolchester; I must see Mr. Delamayn instantly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey went in. There was an interval. The footman reappeared, leaving the\r\nplace. There was another interval. Then there came a knock at the door.\r\nAnne hesitated. The knock was repeated, and the dumb murmuring of Hester\r\nDethridge was heard outside. Anne opened the door.\r\n\r\nHester came in with the breakfast. She pointed to a letter among other\r\nthings on the tray. It was addressed to Anne, in Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting,\r\nand it contained these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father died yesterday. Write your orders for your mourning. The\r\nboy will take them. You are not to trouble yourself to go to London.\r\nSomebody is to come here to you from the shop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne dropped the paper on her lap without looking up. At the same moment\r\nHester Dethridge\xe2\x80\x99s slate was passed stealthily between her eyes and the\r\nnote--with these words traced on it. \xe2\x80\x9cHis mother is coming to-day. His\r\nbrother has been telegraphed from Scotland. He was drunk last night.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s drinking again. I know what that means. Look out, missus--look\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne signed to her to leave the room. She went out, pulling the door to,\r\nbut not closing it behind her.\r\n\r\nThere was another ring at the gate bell. Once more Anne went to the\r\nwindow. Only the lad, this time; arriving to take his orders for the\r\nday. He had barely entered the garden when he was followed by the\r\npostman with letters. In a minute more Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s voice was heard in\r\nthe passage, and Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s heavy step ascended the wooden stairs. Anne\r\nhurried across the room to draw the bolts. Geoffrey met her before she\r\ncould close the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA letter for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, keeping scrupulously out of the room. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t wish to force your inclinations--I only request you to tell me who\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s from.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis manner was as carefully subdued as ever. But the unacknowledged\r\ndistrust in him (when he looked at her) betrayed itself in his eye.\r\n\r\nShe glanced at the handwriting on the address.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Blanche,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\nHe softly put his foot between the door and the post--and waited until\r\nshe had opened and read Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I see it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked--and put in his hand for it through the door.\r\n\r\nThe spirit in Anne which would once have resisted him was dead in her\r\nnow. She handed him the open letter.\r\n\r\nIt was very short. Excepting some brief expressions of fondness, it\r\nwas studiously confined to stating the purpose for which it had been\r\nwritten. Blanche proposed to visit Anne that afternoon, accompanied by\r\nher uncle, she sent word beforehand, to make sure of finding Anne at\r\nhome. That was all. The letter had evidently been written under Sir\r\nPatrick\xe2\x80\x99s advice.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey handed it back, after first waiting a moment to think.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father died yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy wife can\xe2\x80\x99t receive visitors\r\nbefore he is buried. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to force your inclinations. I only say\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t let visitors in here before the funeral--except my own family.\r\nSend a note down stairs. The lad will take it to your friend when he\r\ngoes to London.\xe2\x80\x9d With those words he left.\r\n\r\nAn appeal to the proprieties of life, in the mouth of Geoffrey Delamayn,\r\ncould only mean one of two things. Either he had spoken in brutal\r\nmockery--or he had spoken with some ulterior object in view. Had he\r\nseized on the event of his father\xe2\x80\x99s death as a pretext for isolating his\r\nwife from all communication with the outer world? Were there reasons,\r\nwhich had not yet asserted themselves, for his dreading the result, if\r\nhe allowed Anne to communicate with her friends?\r\n\r\nThe hour wore on, and Hester Dethridge appeared again. The lad was\r\nwaiting for Anne\xe2\x80\x99s orders for her mourning, and for her note to Mrs.\r\nArnold Brinkworth.\r\n\r\nAnne wrote the orders and the note. Once more the horrible slate\r\nappeared when she had done, between the writing paper and her eyes, with\r\nthe hard lines of warning pitilessly traced on it. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has locked the\r\ngate. When there\xe2\x80\x99s a ring we are to come to him for the key. He has\r\nwritten to a woman. Name outside the letter, Mrs. Glenarm. He has had\r\nmore brandy. Like my husband. Mind yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe one way out of the high walls all round the cottage locked. Friends\r\nforbidden to see her. Solitary imprisonment, with her husband for a\r\njailer. Before she had been four-and-twenty hours in the cottage it had\r\ncome to that. And what was to follow?\r\n\r\nShe went back mechanically to the window. The sight of the outer world,\r\nthe occasional view of a passing vehicle, helped to sustain her.\r\n\r\nThe lad appeared in the front garden departing to perform his errand to\r\nLondon. Geoffrey went with him to open the gate, and called after him,\r\nas he passed through it, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget the books!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cbooks?\xe2\x80\x9d What \xe2\x80\x9cbooks?\xe2\x80\x9d Who wanted them? The slightest thing now\r\nroused Anne\xe2\x80\x99s suspicion. For hours afterward the books haunted her mind.\r\n\r\nHe secured the gate and came back again. He stopped under Anne\xe2\x80\x99s window\r\nand called to her. She showed herself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you want air and exercise,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe back garden is at your own disposal.\xe2\x80\x9d He put the key of\r\nthe gate in his pocket and returned to the house.\r\n\r\nAfter some hesitation Anne decided on taking him at his word. In her\r\nstate of suspense, to remain within the four walls of the bedroom was\r\nunendurable. If some lurking snare lay hid under the fair-sounding\r\nproposal which Geoffrey had made, it was less repellent to her boldly to\r\nprove what it might be than to wait pondering over it with her mind\r\nin the dark. She put on her hat and went down into the garden. Nothing\r\nhappened out of the common. Wherever he was he never showed himself.\r\nShe wandered up and down, keeping on the side of the garden which was\r\nfarthest from the dining-room window. To a woman, escape from the place\r\nwas simply impossible. Setting out of the question the height of the\r\nwalls, they were armed at the top with a thick setting of jagged broken\r\nglass. A small back-door in the end wall (intended probably for the\r\ngardener\xe2\x80\x99s use) was bolted and locked--the key having been taken out.\r\nThere was not a house near. The lands of the local growers of vegetables\r\nsurrounded the garden on all sides. In the nineteenth century, and in\r\nthe immediate neighborhood of a great metropolis, Anne was as absolutely\r\nisolated from all contact with the humanity around her as if she lay in\r\nher grave.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of half an hour the silence was broken by a noise of\r\ncarriage wheels on the public road in front, and a ring at the bell.\r\nAnne kept close to the cottage, at the back; determined, if a chance\r\noffered, on speaking to the visitor, whoever the visitor might be.\r\n\r\nShe heard voices in the dining-room through the open window--Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice and the voice of a woman. Who was the woman? Not Mrs. Glenarm,\r\nsurely? After a while the visitor\xe2\x80\x99s voice was suddenly raised. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\r\nis she?\xe2\x80\x9d it said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to see her.\xe2\x80\x9d Anne instantly advanced to the\r\nback-door of the house--and found herself face to face with a lady who\r\nwas a total stranger to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you my son\xe2\x80\x99s wife?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am your son\xe2\x80\x99s prisoner,\xe2\x80\x9d Anne answered.\r\n\r\nLady Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s pale face turned paler still. It was plain that Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreply had confirmed some doubt in the mother s mind which had been\r\nalready suggested to it by the son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, in a whisper.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s heavy footsteps crossed the dining-room. There was no time to\r\nexplain. Anne whispered back,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell my friends what I have told you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey appeared at the dining-room door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cName one of your friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Holchester.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick Lundie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey heard the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about Sir Patrick Lundie?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to see Sir Patrick Lundie,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd your wife can\r\ntell me where to find him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne instantly understood that Lady Holchester would communicate with\r\nSir Patrick. She mentioned his London address. Lady Holchester turned to\r\nleave the cottage. Her son stopped her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s set things straight,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore you go. My mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwent on, addressing himself to Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s much\r\nchance for us two of living comfortably together. Bear witness to the\r\ntruth--will you? What did I tell you at breakfast-time? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I say it\r\nshould be my endeavor to make you a good husband? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I say--in Mrs.\r\nDethridge\xe2\x80\x99s presence--I wanted to make it up?\xe2\x80\x9d He waited until Anne had\r\nanswered in the affirmative, and then appealed to his mother. \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\r\nwhat do you think now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Holchester declined to reveal what she thought. \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see me,\r\nor hear from me, this evening,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Anne. Geoffrey attempted\r\nto repeat his unanswered question. His mother looked at him. His eyes\r\ninstantly dropped before hers. She gravely bent her head to Anne, and\r\ndrew her veil. Her son followed her out in silence to the gate.\r\n\r\nAnne returned to her room, sustained by the first sense of relief which\r\nshe had felt since the morning. \xe2\x80\x9cHis mother is alarmed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to\r\nherself. \xe2\x80\x9cA change will come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA change _was_ to come--with the coming night.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIFTY-FIRST.\r\n\r\nTHE PROPOSAL.\r\n\r\nTOWARD sunset, Lady Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s carriage drew up before the gate of the\r\ncottage.\r\n\r\nThree persons occupied the carriage: Lady Holchester, her eldest son\r\n(now Lord Holchester), and Sir Patrick Lundie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you wait in the carriage, Sir Patrick?\xe2\x80\x9d said Julius. \xe2\x80\x9cOr will\r\nyou come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will wait. If I can be of the least use to _her,_, send for me\r\ninstantly. In the mean time don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to make the stipulation which I\r\nhave suggested. It is the one certain way of putting your brother\xe2\x80\x99s real\r\nfeeling in this matter to the test.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servant had rung the bell without producing any result. He rang\r\nagain. Lady Holchester put a question to Sir Patrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I have an opportunity of speaking to my son\xe2\x80\x99s wife alone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chave you any message to give?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick produced a little note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I appeal to your ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s kindness to give her this?\xe2\x80\x9d The gate\r\nwas opened by the servant-girl, as Lady Holchester took the note.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember,\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated Sir Patrick, earnestly \xe2\x80\x9cif I can be of the\r\nsmallest service to her--don\xe2\x80\x99t think of my position with Mr. Delamayn.\r\nSend for me at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulius and his mother were conducted into the drawing-room. The girl\r\ninformed them that her master had gone up stairs to lie down, and that\r\nhe would be with them immediately.\r\n\r\nBoth mother and son were too anxious to speak. Julius wandered uneasily\r\nabout the room. Some books attracted his notice on a table in the\r\ncorner--four dirty, greasy volumes, with a slip of paper projecting from\r\nthe leaves of one of them, and containing this inscription, \xe2\x80\x9cWith Mr.\r\nPerry\xe2\x80\x99s respects.\xe2\x80\x9d Julius opened the volume. It was the ghastly popular\r\nrecord of Criminal Trials in England, called the Newgate Calendar.\r\nJulius showed it to his mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s taste in literature!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, with a faint smile.\r\n\r\nLady Holchester signed to him to put the book back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have seen Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s wife already--have you not?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nThere was no contempt now in her tone when she referred to Anne. The\r\nimpression produced on her by her visit to the cottage, earlier in the\r\nday, associated Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s wife with family anxieties of no trivial\r\nkind. She might still (for Mrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s sake) be a woman to be\r\ndisliked--but she was no longer a woman to be despised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw her when she came to Swanhaven,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julius. \xe2\x80\x9cI agree with Sir\r\nPatrick in thinking her a very interesting person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did Sir Patrick say to you about Geoffrey this afternoon--while I\r\nwas out of the room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly what he said to _you._ He thought their position toward each other\r\nhere a very deplorable one. He considered that the reasons were serious\r\nfor our interfering immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s own opinion, Julius, goes farther than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has not acknowledged it, that I know of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow _can_ he acknowledge it--to us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and Geoffrey entered the room.\r\n\r\nJulius eyed him closely as they shook hands. His eyes were bloodshot;\r\nhis face was flushed; his utterance was thick--the look of him was the\r\nlook of a man who had been drinking hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his mother. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat brings you back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJulius has a proposal to make to you,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Holchester answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\napprove of it; and I have come with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey turned to his brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can a rich man like you want with a poor devil like me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to do you justice, Geoffrey--if you will help me, by meeting me\r\nhalf-way. Our mother has told you about the will?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not down for a half-penny in the will. I expected as much. Go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are wrong--you _are_ down in it. There is liberal provision made\r\nfor you in a codicil. Unhappily, my father died without signing it. It\r\nis needless to say that I consider it binding on me for all that. I am\r\nready to do for you what your father would have done for you. And I only\r\nask for one concession in return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat may that be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are living here very unhappily, Geoffrey, with your wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho says so? I don\xe2\x80\x99t, for one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulius laid his hand kindly on his brother\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t trifle with such a serious matter as this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nmarriage is, in every sense of the word, a misfortune--not only to you\r\nbut to your wife. It is impossible that you can live together. I have\r\ncome here to ask you to consent to a separation. Do that--and the\r\nprovision made for you in the unsigned codicil is yours. What do you\r\nsay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey shook his brother\xe2\x80\x99s hand off his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say--No!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\nLady Holchester interfered for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour brother\xe2\x80\x99s generous offer deserves a better answer than that,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy answer,\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated Geoffrey, \xe2\x80\x9cis--No!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat between them with his clenched fists resting on his\r\nknees--absolutely impenetrable to any thing that either of them could\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn your situation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julius, \xe2\x80\x9ca refusal is sheer madness. I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\naccept it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo as you like about that. My mind\xe2\x80\x99s made up. I won\xe2\x80\x99t let my wife be\r\ntaken away from me. Here she stays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe brutal tone in which he had made that reply roused Lady Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not only behaving with the grossest\r\ningratitude toward your brother--you are forcing a suspicion into your\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s mind. You have some motive that you are hiding from us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned on his mother with a sudden ferocity which made Julius spring\r\nto his feet. The next instant his eyes were on the ground, and the devil\r\nthat possessed him was quiet again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome motive I\xe2\x80\x99m hiding from you?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, with his head down, and\r\nhis utterance thicker than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m ready to have my motive posted all\r\nover London, if you like. I\xe2\x80\x99m fond of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked up as he said the last words. Lady Holchester turned away\r\nher head--recoiling from her own son. So overwhelming was the shock\r\ninflicted on her that even the strongly rooted prejudice which Mrs.\r\nGlenarm had implanted in her mind yielded to it. At that moment she\r\nabsolutely pitied Anne!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor creature!\xe2\x80\x9d said Lady Holchester.\r\n\r\nHe took instant offense at those two words. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t have my wife pitied\r\nby any body.\xe2\x80\x9d With that reply, he dashed into the passage; and called\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x9cAnne! come down!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer soft voice answered; her light footfall was heard on the stairs. She\r\ncame into the room. Julius advanced, took her hand, and held it kindly\r\nin his. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are having a little family discussion,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, trying to\r\ngive her confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Geoffrey is getting hot over it, as usual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey appealed sternly to his mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at her!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIs she starved? Is she in rags? Is she covered\r\nwith bruises?\xe2\x80\x9d He turned to Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have come here to propose a\r\nseparation. They both believe I hate you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t hate you. I\xe2\x80\x99m a good\r\nChristian. I owe it to you that I\xe2\x80\x99m cut out of my father\xe2\x80\x99s will. I\r\nforgive you that. I owe it to you that I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost the chance of marrying\r\na woman with ten thousand a year. I forgive you _that._ I\xe2\x80\x99m not a man\r\nwho does things by halves. I said it should be my endeavor to make you a\r\ngood husband. I said it was my wish to make it up. Well! I am as good\r\nas my word. And what\xe2\x80\x99s the consequence? I am insulted. My mother comes\r\nhere, and my brother comes here--and they offer me money to part from\r\nyou. Money be hanged! I\xe2\x80\x99ll be beholden to nobody. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get my own\r\nliving. Shame on the people who interfere between man and wife!\r\nShame!--that\xe2\x80\x99s what I say--shame!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne looked, for an explanation, from her husband to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you proposed a separation between us?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--on terms of the utmost advantage to my son; arranged with every\r\npossible consideration toward you. Is there any objection on your side?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Lady Holchester! is it necessary to ask me? What does he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has refused.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRefused!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t go back from my word; I stick to what I\r\nsaid this morning. It\xe2\x80\x99s my endeavor to make you a good husband. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmy wish to make it up.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused, and then added his last reason: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nfond of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met as he said it to her. Julius felt Anne\xe2\x80\x99s hand suddenly\r\ntighten round his. The desperate grasp of the frail cold fingers, the\r\nimploring terror in the gentle sensitive face as it slowly turned his\r\nway, said to him as if in words, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t leave me friendless to-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you both stop here till domesday,\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\nnothing more out of me. You have had my reply.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, he seated himself doggedly in a corner of the room;\r\nwaiting--ostentatiously waiting--for his mother and his brother to take\r\ntheir leave. The position was serious. To argue the matter with him that\r\nnight was hopeless. To invite Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s interference would only be\r\nto provoke his savage temper to a new outbreak. On the other hand, to\r\nleave the helpless woman, after what had passed, without another effort\r\nto befriend her, was, in her situation, an act of downright inhumanity,\r\nand nothing less. Julius took the one way out of the difficulty that was\r\nleft--the one way worthy of him as a compassionate and an honorable man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will drop it for to-night, Geoffrey,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am not the\r\nless resolved, in spite of all that you have said, to return to the\r\nsubject to-morrow. It would save me some inconvenience--a second journey\r\nhere from town, and then going back again to my engagements--if I staid\r\nwith you to-night. Can you give me a bed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA look flashed on him from Anne, which thanked him as no words could\r\nhave thanked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive you a bed?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Geoffrey. He checked himself, on the point\r\nof refusing. His mother was watching him; his wife was watching him--and\r\nhis wife knew that the room above them was a room to spare. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he resumed, in another tone, with his eye on his mother. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nempty room up stairs. Have it, if you like. You won\xe2\x80\x99t find I\xe2\x80\x99ve changed\r\nmy mind to-morrow--but that\xe2\x80\x99s your look-out. Stop here, if the fancy\r\ntakes you. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no objection. It don\xe2\x80\x99t matter to Me.--Will you trust his\r\nlordship under my roof?\xe2\x80\x9d he added, addressing his mother. \xe2\x80\x9cI might have\r\nsome motive that I\xe2\x80\x99m hiding from you, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d Without waiting for an\r\nanswer, he turned to Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and tell old Dummy to put the sheets\r\non the bed. Say there\xe2\x80\x99s a live lord in the house--she\xe2\x80\x99s to send in\r\nsomething devilish good for supper!\xe2\x80\x9d He burst fiercely into a forced\r\nlaugh. Lady Holchester rose at the moment when Anne was leaving the\r\nroom. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not be here when you return,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me bid you\r\ngood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook hands with Anne--giving her Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s note, unseen, at the\r\nsame moment. Anne left the room. Without addressing another word to her\r\nsecond son, Lady Holchester beckoned to Julius to give her his arm. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nhave acted nobly toward your brother,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him. \xe2\x80\x9cMy one comfort\r\nand my one hope, Julius, are in you.\xe2\x80\x9d They went out together to the\r\ngate, Geoffrey following them with the key in his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be too\r\nanxious,\xe2\x80\x9d Julius whispered to his mother. \xe2\x80\x9cI will keep the drink out\r\nof his way to-night--and I will bring you a better account of him\r\nto-morrow. Explain every thing to Sir Patrick as you go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe handed Lady Holchester into the carriage; and re-entered, leaving\r\nGeoffrey to lock the gate. The brothers returned in silence to the\r\ncottage. Julius had concealed it from his mother--but he was seriously\r\nuneasy in secret. Naturally prone to look at all things on their\r\nbrighter side, he could place no hopeful interpretation on what Geoffrey\r\nhad said and done that night. The conviction that he was deliberately\r\nacting a part, in his present relations with his wife, for some\r\nabominable purpose of his own, had rooted itself firmly in Julius.\r\nFor the first time in his experience of his brother, the pecuniary\r\nconsideration was not the uppermost consideration in Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\nThey went back into the drawing-room. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you have to drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Geoffrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t keep me company over a drop of brandy-and-water?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. You have had enough brandy-and-water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a moment of frowning self-consideration in the glass, Geoffrey\r\nabruptly agreed with Julius \xe2\x80\x9cI look like it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll soon put\r\nthat right.\xe2\x80\x9d He disappeared, and returned with a wet towel tied round\r\nhis head. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do while the women are getting your bed ready?\r\nLiberty Hall here. I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken to cultivating my mind---I\xe2\x80\x99m a reformed\r\ncharacter, you know, now I\xe2\x80\x99m a married man. You do what you like. I\r\nshall read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned to the side-table, and, producing the volumes of the Newgate\r\nCalendar, gave one to his brother. Julius handed it back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t cultivate your mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwith such a book as that.\r\nVile actions recorded in vile English, make vile reading, Geoffrey, in\r\nevery sense of the word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will do for me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know good English when I see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that frank acknowledgment--to which the great majority of his\r\ncompanions at school and college might have subscribed without doing the\r\nslightest injustice to the present state of English education--Geoffrey\r\ndrew his chair to the table, and opened one of the volumes of his record\r\nof crime.\r\n\r\nThe evening newspaper was lying on the sofa. Julius took it up, and\r\nseated himself opposite to his brother. He noticed, with some surprise,\r\nthat Geoffrey appeared to have a special object in consulting his book.\r\nInstead of beginning at the first page, he ran the leaves through his\r\nfingers, and turned them down at certain places, before he entered on\r\nhis reading. If Julius had looked over his brother\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, instead\r\nof only looking at him across the table, he would have seen that\r\nGeoffrey passed by all the lighter crimes reported in the Calendar, and\r\nmarked for his own private reading the cases of murder only.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIFTY-SECOND.\r\n\r\nTHE APPARITION.\r\n\r\nTHE night had advanced. It was close on twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock when Anne heard\r\nthe servant\xe2\x80\x99s voice, outside her bedroom door, asking leave to speak\r\nwith her for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe gentleman down stairs wishes to see you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean Mr. Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Mr. Delamayn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut in the garden, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne went down stairs, and found Julius alone in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to disturb you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid Geoffrey is ill. The\r\nlandlady has gone to bed, I am told--and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where to apply for\r\nmedical assistance. Do you know of any doctor in the neighborhood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne, like Julius, was a perfect stranger to the neighborhood. She\r\nsuggested making inquiry of the servant. On speaking to the girl, it\r\nturned out that she knew of a medical man, living within ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwalk of the cottage. She could give plain directions enabling any person\r\nto find the place--but she was afraid, at that hour of the night and in\r\nthat lonely neighborhood, to go out by herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he seriously ill?\xe2\x80\x9d Anne asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is in such a state of nervous irritability,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julius, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t remain still for two moments together in the same place. It began\r\nwith incessant restlessness while he was reading here. I persuaded him\r\nto go to bed. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t lie still for an instant--he came down again,\r\nburning with fever, and more restless than ever. He is out in the garden\r\nin spite of every thing I could do to prevent him; trying, as he says,\r\nto \xe2\x80\x98run it off.\xe2\x80\x99 It appears to be serious to _me._. Come and judge for\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led Anne into the next room; and, opening the shutter, pointed to the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nThe clouds had cleared off; the night was fine. The clear starlight\r\nshowed Geoffrey, stripped to his shirt and drawers, running round and\r\nround the garden. He apparently believed himself to be contending at the\r\nFulham foot-race. At times, as the white figure circled round and\r\nround in the star-light, they heard him cheering for \xe2\x80\x9cthe South.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nslackening thump of his feet on the ground, the heavier and heavier\r\ngasps in which he drew his breath, as he passed the window, gave warning\r\nthat his strength was failing him. Exhaustion, if it led to no worse\r\nconsequences, would force him to return to the house. In the state of\r\nhis brain at that moment who could say what the result might be, if\r\nmedical help was not called in?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go for the doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julius, \xe2\x80\x9cif you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my leaving\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for Anne to set any apprehensions of her own against\r\nthe plain necessity for summoning assistance. They found the key of the\r\ngate in the pocket of Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s coat up stairs. Anne went with Julius\r\nto let him out. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can I thank you!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gratefully. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nshould I have done without _you!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t be a moment longer than I can help,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, and left her.\r\n\r\nShe secured the gate again, and went back to the cottage. The servant\r\nmet her at the door, and proposed calling up Hester Dethridge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the master may do while his brother\xe2\x80\x99s away,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe girl. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd one more of us isn\xe2\x80\x99t one too many, when we are only women\r\nin the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cWake your mistress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter ascending the stairs, they looked out into the garden, through the\r\nwindow at the end of the passage on the upper floor. He was still going\r\nround and round, but very slowly: his pace was fast slackening to a\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\nAnne went back to her room, and waited near the open door--ready to\r\nclose and fasten it instantly if any thing occurred to alarm her. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nchanged I am!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery thing frightens me, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe inference was the natural one--but not the true one. The change\r\nwas not in herself, but in the situation in which she was placed. Her\r\nposition during the investigation at Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s house had tried her\r\nmoral courage only. It had exacted from her one of those noble efforts\r\nof self-sacrifice which the hidden forces in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s nature are\r\nessentially capable of making. Her position at the cottage tried her\r\nphysical courage: it called on her to rise superior to the sense of\r\nactual bodily danger--while that danger was lurking in the dark. There,\r\nthe woman\xe2\x80\x99s nature sank under the stress laid on it--there, her courage\r\ncould strike no root in the strength of her love--there, the animal\r\ninstincts were the instincts appealed to; and the firmness wanted was\r\nthe firmness of a man.\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge\xe2\x80\x99s door opened. She walked straight into Anne\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\nThe yellow clay-cold color of her face showed a faint flush of warmth;\r\nits deathlike stillness was stirred by a touch of life. The stony eyes,\r\nfixed as ever in their gaze, shone strangely with a dim inner lustre.\r\nHer gray hair, so neatly arranged at other times, was in disorder under\r\nher cap. All her movements were quicker than usual. Something had roused\r\nthe stagnant vitality in the woman--it was working in her mind; it was\r\nforcing itself outward into her face. The servants at Windygates, in\r\npast times, had seen these signs, and had known them for a warning to\r\nleave Hester Dethridge to herself.\r\n\r\nAnne asked her if she had heard what had happened.\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind being disturbed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wrote on her slate: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to be disturbed. I have been dreaming\r\nbad dreams. It\xe2\x80\x99s good for me to be wakened, when sleep takes me backward\r\nin my life. What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with you? Frightened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wrote again, and pointed toward the garden with one hand, while she\r\nheld the slate up with the other: \xe2\x80\x9cFrightened of _him?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTerribly frightened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wrote for the third time, and offered the slate to Anne with a\r\nghastly smile: \xe2\x80\x9cI have been through it all. I know. You\xe2\x80\x99re only at the\r\nbeginning now. He\xe2\x80\x99ll put the wrinkles in your face, and the gray in your\r\nhair. There will come a time when you\xe2\x80\x99ll wish yourself dead and buried.\r\nYou will live through it, for all that. Look at Me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she read the last three words, Anne heard the garden door below\r\nopened and banged to again. She caught Hester Dethridge by the arm,\r\nand listened. The tramp of Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s feet, staggering heavily in the\r\npassage, gave token of his approach to the stairs. He was talking to\r\nhimself, still possessed by the delusion that he was at the foot-race.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive to four on Delamayn. Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s won. Three cheers for the South,\r\nand one cheer more. Devilish long race. Night already! Perry! where\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nPerry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe advanced, staggering from side to side of the passage. The stairs\r\nbelow creaked as he set his foot on them. Hester Dethridge dragged\r\nherself free from Anne, advanced, with her candle in her hand, and threw\r\nopen Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom door; returned to the head of the stairs; and\r\nstood there, firm as a rock, waiting for him. He looked up, as he set\r\nhis foot on the next stair, and met the view of Hester\xe2\x80\x99s face, brightly\r\nilluminated by the candle, looking down at him. On the instant he\r\nstopped, rooted to the place on which he stood. \xe2\x80\x9cGhost! witch! devil!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he cried out, \xe2\x80\x9ctake your eyes off me!\xe2\x80\x9d He shook his fist at her\r\nfuriously, with an oath--sprang back into the hall--and shut himself\r\ninto the dining-room from the sight of her. The panic which had seized\r\nhim once already in the kitchen-garden at Windygates, under the eyes\r\nof the dumb cook, had fastened its hold on him once more.\r\nFrightened--absolutely frightened--of Hester Dethridge!\r\n\r\nThe gate bell rang. Julius had returned with the doctor.\r\n\r\nAnne gave the key to the girl to let them in. Hester wrote on her\r\nslate, as composedly as if nothing had happened: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll find me in the\r\nkitchen, if they want me. I sha\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t go back to my bedroom. My bedroom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfull of bad dreams.\xe2\x80\x9d She descended the stairs. Anne waited in the upper\r\npassage, looking over into the hall below. \xe2\x80\x9cYour brother is in the\r\ndrawing-room,\xe2\x80\x9d she called down to Julius. \xe2\x80\x9cThe landlady is in the\r\nkitchen, if you want her.\xe2\x80\x9d She returned to her room, and waited for what\r\nmight happen next.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief interval she heard the drawing-room door open, and the\r\nvoices of the men out side. There seemed to be some difficulty in\r\npersuading Geoffrey to ascend the stairs; he persisted in declaring that\r\nHester Dethridge was waiting for him at the top of them. After a little\r\nthey persuaded him that the way was free. Anne heard them ascend the\r\nstairs and close his bedroom door.\r\n\r\nAnother and a longer interval passed before the door opened again.\r\nThe doctor was going away. He said his parting words to Julius in the\r\npassage. \xe2\x80\x9cLook in at him from time to time through the night, and give\r\nhim another dose of the sedative mixture if he wakes. There is nothing\r\nto b e alarmed about in the restlessness and the fever. They are only\r\nthe outward manifestations of some serious mischief hidden under them.\r\nSend for the medical man who has last attended him. Knowledge of the\r\npatient\xe2\x80\x99s constitution is very important knowledge in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Julius returned from letting the doctor out, Anne met him in the\r\nhall. She was at once struck by the worn look in his face, and by the\r\nfatigue which expressed itself in all his movements.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want rest,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cPray go to your room. I have heard what the\r\ndoctor said to you. Leave it to the landlady and to me to sit up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulius owned that he had been traveling from Scotland during the\r\nprevious night. But he was unwilling to abandon the responsibility of\r\nwatching his brother. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not strong enough, I am sure, to take my\r\nplace,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Geoffrey has some unreasoning horror of\r\nthe landlady which makes it very undesirable that he should see her\r\nagain, in his present state. I will go up to my room, and rest on the\r\nbed. If you hear any thing you have only to come and call me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn hour more passed.\r\n\r\nAnne went to Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s door and listened. He was stirring in his bed,\r\nand muttering to himself. She went on to the door of the next room,\r\nwhich Julius had left partly open. Fatigue had overpowered him; she\r\nheard, within, the quiet breathing of a man in a sound sleep. Anne\r\nturned back again resolved not to disturb him.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the stairs she hesitated--not knowing what to do. Her\r\nhorror of entering Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s room, by herself, was insurmountable.\r\nBut who else was to do it? The girl had gone to bed. The reason which\r\nJulius had given for not employing the assistance of Hester Dethridge\r\nwas unanswerable. She listened again at Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s door. No sound was\r\nnow audible in the room to a person in the passage outside. Would it be\r\nwell to look in, and make sure that he had only fallen asleep again?\r\nShe hesitated once more--she was still hesitating, when Hester Dethridge\r\nappeared from the kitchen.\r\n\r\nShe joined Anne at the top of the stairs--looked at her--and wrote a\r\nline on her slate: \xe2\x80\x9cFrightened to go in? Leave it to Me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe silence in the room justified the inference that he was asleep.\r\nIf Hester looked in, Hester could do no harm now. Anne accepted the\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you find any thing wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t disturb his brother.\r\nCome to me first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that caution she withdrew. It was then nearly two in the morning.\r\nShe, like Julius, was sinking from fatigue. After waiting a little, and\r\nhearing nothing, she threw herself on the sofa in her room. If any thing\r\nhappened, a knock at the door would rouse her instantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the mean while Hester Dethridge opened Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom door and\r\nwent in.\r\n\r\nThe movements and the mutterings which Anne had heard, had been\r\nmovements and mutterings in his sleep. The doctor\xe2\x80\x99s composing draught,\r\npartially disturbed in its operation for the moment only, had recovered\r\nits sedative influence on his brain. Geoffrey was in a deep and quiet\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nHester stood near the door, looking at him. She moved to go out\r\nagain--stopped--and fixed her eyes suddenly on one of the inner corners\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\nThe same sinister change which had passed over her once already in\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s presence, when they met in the kitchen-garden at Windygates,\r\nnow passed over her again. Her closed lips dropped apart. Her eyes\r\nslowly dilated--moved, inch by inch from the corner, following something\r\nalong the empty wall, in the direction of the bed--stopped at the head\r\nof the bed, exactly above Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping face--stared, rigid and\r\nglittering, as if they saw a sight of horror close over it. He sighed\r\nfaintly in his sleep. The sound, slight as it was, broke the spell that\r\nheld her. She slowly lifted her withered hands, and wrung them above her\r\nhead; fled back across the passage; and, rushing into her room, sank on\r\nher knees at the bedside.\r\n\r\nNow, in the dead of night, a strange thing happened. Now, in the silence\r\nand the darkness, a hideous secret was revealed.\r\n\r\nIn the sanctuary of her own room--with all the other inmates of the\r\nhouse sleeping round her--the dumb woman threw off the mysterious and\r\nterrible disguise under which she deliberately isolated herself among\r\nher fellow-creatures in the hours of the day. Hester Dethridge spoke. In\r\nlow, thick, smothered accents--in a wild litany of her own--she prayed.\r\nShe called upon the mercy of God for deliverance from herself; for\r\ndeliverance from the possession of the Devil; for blindness to fall on\r\nher, for death to strike her, so that she might never see that unnamed\r\nHorror more! Sobs shook the whole frame of the stony woman whom nothing\r\nhuman moved at other times. Tears poured over those clay-cold cheeks.\r\nOne by one, the frantic words of her prayer died away on her lips.\r\nFierce shuddering fits shook her from head to foot. She started up from\r\nher knees in the darkness. Light! light! light! The unnamed Horror was\r\nbehind her in his room. The unnamed Horror was looking at her through\r\nhis open door. She found the match-box, and lit the candle on her\r\ntable--lit the two other candles set for ornament only on the mantle\r\npiece--and looked all round the brightly lighted little room. \xe2\x80\x9cAha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she said to herself, wiping the cold sweat of her agony from her face.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCandles to other people. God\xe2\x80\x99s light to _me._ Nothing to be seen!\r\nnothing to be seen!\xe2\x80\x9d Taking one of the candles in her hand, she crossed\r\nthe passage, with her head down, turned her back on Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s open\r\ndoor, closed it quickly and softly, stretching out her hand behind her,\r\nand retreated again to her own room. She fastened the door, and took\r\nan ink-bottle and a pen from the mantle-piece. After considering for a\r\nmoment, she hung a handkerchief over the keyhole, and laid an old shawl\r\nlongwise at the bottom of the door, so as to hide the light in her room\r\nfrom the observation of any one in the house who might wake and come\r\nthat way. This done, she opened the upper part of her dress, and,\r\nslipping her fingers into a secret pocket hidden in the inner side of\r\nher stays, produced from it some neatly folded leaves of thin paper.\r\nSpread out on the table, the leaves revealed themselves--all but the\r\nlast--as closely covered with writing, in her own hand.\r\n\r\nThe first leaf was headed by this inscription: \xe2\x80\x9cMy Confession. To be put\r\ninto my coffin, and to be buried with me when I die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned the manuscript over, so as to get at the last page. The\r\ngreater part of it was left blank. A few lines of writing, at the top,\r\nbore the date of the day of the week and month on which Lady Lundie had\r\ndismissed her from her situation at Windygates. The entry was expressed\r\nin these terms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen IT again to-day. The first time for two months past. In\r\nthe kitchen-garden. Standing behind the young gentleman whose name is\r\nDelamayn. Resist the Devil, and he will flee from you. I have resisted.\r\nBy prayer. By meditation in solitude. By reading good books. I have left\r\nmy place. I have lost sight of the young gentleman for good. Who will\r\nIT stand behind? and point to next? Lord have mercy upon me! Christ have\r\nmercy upon me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnder this she now added the following lines, first carefully prefixing\r\nthe date:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen IT again to-night. I notice one awful change. IT has\r\nappeared twice behind the same person. This has never happened before.\r\nThis makes the temptation more terrible than ever. To-night, in his\r\nbedroom, between the bed-head and the wall, I have seen IT behind\r\nyoung Mr. Delamayn again. The head just above his face, and the finger\r\npointing downward at his throat. Twice behind this one man. And never\r\ntwice behind any other living creature till now. If I see IT a third\r\ntime behind him--Lord deliver me! Christ deliver me! I daren\xe2\x80\x99t think of\r\nit. He shall leave my cottage to-morrow. I would fain have drawn back\r\nfrom the bargain, when the stranger took the lodgings for his friend,\r\nand the friend proved to be Mr. Delamayn. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, even then.\r\nAfter the warning to-night, my mind is made up. He shall go. He may\r\nhave his money back, if he likes. He shall go. (Memorandum: Felt the\r\ntemptation whispering this time, and the terror tearing at me all the\r\nwhile, as I have never felt them yet. Resisted, as before, by prayer.\r\nAm now going down stairs to meditate against it in solitude--to fortify\r\nmyself against it by good books. Lord be merciful to me a sinner!)\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn those words she closed the entry, and put the manuscript back in the\r\nsecret pocket in her stays.\r\n\r\nShe went down to the little room looking on the garden, which had once\r\nbeen her brother\xe2\x80\x99s study. There she lit a lamp, and took some books from\r\na shelf that hung against the wall. The books were the Bible, a volume\r\nof Methodist sermons, and a set of collected Memoirs of Methodist\r\nsaints. Ranging these last carefully round her, in an order of her own,\r\nHester Dethridge sat down with the Bible on her lap to watch out the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIFTY-THIRD.\r\n\r\nWHAT had happened in the hours of darkness?\r\n\r\nThis was Anne\xe2\x80\x99s first thought, when the sunlight poured in at her\r\nwindow, and woke her the next morning.\r\n\r\nShe made immediate inquiry of the servant. The girl could only speak for\r\nherself. Nothing had occurred to disturb her after she had gone to bed.\r\nHer master was still, she believed, in his room. Mrs. Dethridge was at\r\nher work in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nAnne went to the kitchen. Hester Dethridge was at her usual occupation\r\nat that time--preparing the breakfast. The slight signs of animation\r\nwhich Anne had noticed in her when they last met appeared no more.\r\nThe dull look was back again in her stony eyes; the lifeless torpor\r\npossessed all her movements. Asked if any thing had happened in the\r\nnight, she slowly shook her stolid head, slowly made the sign with her\r\nhand which signified, \xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLeaving the kitchen, Anne saw Julius in the front garden. She went out\r\nand joined him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I have to thank your consideration for me for some hours of\r\nrest,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was five in the morning when I woke. I hope you\r\nhad no reason to regret having left me to sleep? I went into Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom, and found him stirring. A second dose of the mixture composed\r\nhim again. The fever has gone. He looks weaker and paler, but in other\r\nrespects like himself. We will return directly to the question of his\r\nhealth. I have something to say to you, first, about a change which may\r\nbe coming in your life here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he consented to the separation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. He is as obstinate about it as ever. I have placed the matter\r\nbefore him in every possible light. He still refuses, positively\r\nrefuses, a provision which would make him an independent man for life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it the provision he might have had, Lord Holchester, if--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he had married Mrs. Glenarm? No. It is impossible, consistently with\r\nmy duty to my mother, and with what I owe to the position in which my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s death has placed me, that I can offer him such a fortune as\r\nMrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s. Still, it is a handsome income which he is mad enough\r\nto refuse. I shall persist in pressing it on him. He must and shall take\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne felt no reviving hope roused in her by his last words. She turned\r\nto another subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had something to tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou spoke of a change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue. The landlady here is a very strange person; and she has done\r\na very strange thing. She has given Geoffrey notice to quit these\r\nlodgings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNotice to quit?\xe2\x80\x9d Anne repeated, in amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. In a formal letter. She handed it to me open, as soon as I was\r\nup this morning. It was impossible to get any explanation from her. The\r\npoor dumb creature simply wrote on her slate: \xe2\x80\x98He may have his money\r\nback, if he likes: he shall go!\xe2\x80\x99 Greatly to my surprise (for the woman\r\ninspires him with the strongest aversion) Geoffrey refuses to go until\r\nhis term is up. I have made the peace between them for to-day. Mrs.\r\nDethridge very reluctantly, consents to give him four-and-twenty hours.\r\nAnd there the matter rests at present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can her motive be?\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s useless to inquire. Her mind is evidently off its balance. One\r\nthing is clear, Geoffrey shall not keep you here much longer. The\r\ncoming change will remove you from this dismal place--which is one thing\r\ngained. And it is quite possible that new scenes and new surroundings\r\nmay have their influence on Geoffrey for good. His conduct--otherwise\r\nquite incomprehensible--may be the result of some latent nervous\r\nirritation which medical help might reach. I don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to disguise\r\nfrom myself or from you, that your position here is a most deplorable\r\none. But before we despair of the future, let us at least inquire\r\nwhether there is any explanation of my brother\xe2\x80\x99s present behavior to\r\nbe found in the present state of my brother\xe2\x80\x99s health. I have been\r\nconsidering what the doctor said to me last night. The first thing to do\r\nis to get the best medical advice on Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s case which is to be had.\r\nWhat do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daren\xe2\x80\x99t tell you what I think, Lord Holchester. I will try--it is\r\na very small return to make for your kindness--I will try to see my\r\nposition with your eyes, not with mine. The best medical advice that you\r\ncan obtain is the advice of Mr. Speedwell. It was he who first made the\r\ndiscovery that your brother was in broken health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very man for our purpose! I will send him here to-day or to-morrow.\r\nIs there any thing else I can do for you? I shall see Sir Patrick as\r\nsoon as I get to town. Have you any message for him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne hesitated. Looking attentively at her, Julius noticed that she\r\nchanged color when he mentioned Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you say that I gratefully thank him for the letter which Lady\r\nHolchester was so good us to give me last night,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd will\r\nyou entreat him, from me, not to expose himself, on my account,\r\nto--\xe2\x80\x9d she hesitated, and finished the sentence with her eyes on the\r\nground--\xe2\x80\x9cto what might happen, if he came here and insisted on seeing\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he propose to do that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated again. The little nervous contraction of her lips at one\r\nside of the mouth became more marked than usual. \xe2\x80\x9cHe writes that his\r\nanxiety is unendurable, and that he is resolved to see me,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered\r\nsoftly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is likely to hold to his resolution, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julius. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I\r\nsaw him yesterday, Sir Patrick spoke of you in terms of admiration--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped. The bright tears were glittering on Anne\xe2\x80\x99s eyelashes; one\r\nof her hands was toying nervously with something hidden (possibly Sir\r\nPatrick\xe2\x80\x99s letter) in the bosom of her dress. \xe2\x80\x9cI thank him with my whole\r\nheart,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in low, faltering tones. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it is best that he\r\nshould not come here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to write to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I should prefer your giving him my message.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulius understood that the subject was to proceed no further. Sir\r\nPatrick\xe2\x80\x99s letter had produced some impression on her, which the\r\nsensitive nature of the woman seemed to shrink from acknowledging, even\r\nto herself. They turned back to enter the cottage. At the door they were\r\nmet by a surprise. Hester Dethridge, with her bonnet on--dressed, at\r\nthat hour of the morning, to go out!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to market already?\xe2\x80\x9d Anne asked.\r\n\r\nHester shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you coming back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester wrote on her slate: \xe2\x80\x9cNot till the night-time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout another word of explanation she pulled her veil down over her\r\nface, and made for the gate. The key had been left in the dining-room by\r\nJulius, after he had let the doctor out. Hester had it in her hand. She\r\nopened he gate and closed the door after her, leaving the key in the\r\nlock. At the moment when the door banged to Geoffrey appeared in the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the key?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s gone out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis brother answered the question. He looked backward and forward\r\nsuspiciously between Julius and Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does she go out for at his\r\ntime?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHas she left the house to avoid Me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulius thought this the likely explanation. Geoffrey went down sulkily\r\nto the gate to lock it, and returned to them, with the key in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m obliged to be careful of the gate,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe neighborhood\r\nswarms with beggars and tramps. If you want to go out,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nturning pointedly to Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m at your service, as a good husband ought\r\nto be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a hurried breakfast Julius took his departure. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t accept\r\nyour refusal,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his brother, before Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will see me\r\nhere again.\xe2\x80\x9d Geoffrey obstinately repeated the refusal. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you come\r\nhere every day of your life,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit will be just the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gate closed on Julius. Anne returned again to the solitude of her\r\nown chamber. Geoffrey entered the drawing-room, placed the volumes of\r\nthe Newgate Calendar on the table before him, and resumed the reading\r\nwhich he had been unable to continue on the evening before.\r\n\r\nHour after hour he doggedly plodded through one case of murder after\r\nanother. He had read one good half of the horrid chronicle of crime\r\nbefore his power of fixing his attention began to fail him. Then he\r\nlit his pipe, and went out to think over it in the garden. However the\r\natrocities of which he had been reading might differ in other\r\nrespects, there was one terrible point of resemblance, which he had\r\nnot anticipated, and in which every one of the cases agreed. Sooner\r\nor later, there was the dead body always certain to be found; always\r\nbearing its dumb witness, in the traces of poison or in the marks of\r\nviolence, to the crime committed on it.\r\n\r\nHe walked to and fro slowly, still pondering over the problem which\r\nhad first found its way into his mind when he had stopped in the front\r\ngarden and had looked up at Anne\xe2\x80\x99s window in the dark. \xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d That had\r\nbeen the one question before him, from the time when the lawyer had\r\nannihilated his hopes of a divorce. It remained the one question still.\r\nThere was no answer to it in his own brain; there was no answer to it in\r\nthe book which he had been consulting. Every thing was in his favor if\r\nhe could only find out \xe2\x80\x9chow.\xe2\x80\x9d He had got his hated wife up stairs at his\r\nmercy--thanks to his refusal of the money which Julius had offered\r\nto him. He was living in a place absolutely secluded from public\r\nobservation on all sides of it--thanks to his resolution to remain at\r\nthe cottage, even after his landlady had insulted him by sending him\r\na notice to quit. Every thing had been prepared, every thing had been\r\nsacrificed, to the fulfillment of one purpose--and how to attain that\r\npurpose was still the same impenetrable mystery to him which it had been\r\nfrom the first!\r\n\r\nWhat was the other alternative? To accept the proposal which Julius had\r\nmade. In other words, to give up his vengeance on Anne, and to turn his\r\nback on the splendid future which Mrs. Glenarm\xe2\x80\x99s devotion still offered\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nNever! He would go back to the books. He was not at the end of them. The\r\nslightest hint in the pages which were still to be read might set his\r\nsluggish brain working in the right direction. The way to be rid of her,\r\nwithout exciting the suspicion of any living creature, in the house or\r\nout of it, was a way that might be found yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCould a man, in his position of life, reason in this brutal manner?\r\ncould he act in this merciless way? Surely the thought of what he was\r\nabout to do must have troubled him this time!\r\n\r\nPause for a moment--and look back at him in the past.\r\n\r\nDid he feel any remorse when he was plotting the betrayal of Arnold in\r\nthe garden at Windygates? The sense which feels remorse had not been put\r\ninto him. What he is now is the legitimate consequence of what he was\r\nthen. A far more serious temptation is now urging him to commit a far\r\nmore serious crime. How is he to resist? Will his skill in rowing\r\n(as Sir Patrick once put it), his swiftness in running, his admirable\r\ncapacity and endurance in other physical exercises, help him to win a\r\npurely moral victory over his own selfishness and his own cruelty? No!\r\nThe moral and mental neglect of himself, which the material tone of\r\npublic feeling about him has tacitly encouraged, has left him at the\r\nmercy of the worst instincts in his nature--of all that is most vile\r\nand of all that is most dangerous in the composition of the natural\r\nman. With the mass of his fellows, no harm out of the common has come of\r\nthis, because no temptation out of the common has passed their way. But\r\nwith _him,_ the case is reversed. A temptation out of the common has\r\npassed _his_ way. How does it find him prepared to meet it? It finds\r\nhim, literally and exactly, what his training has left him, in the\r\npresence of any temptation small or great--a defenseless man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeoffrey returned to the cottage. The servant stopped him in the\r\npassage, to ask at what time he wished to dine. Instead of answering, he\r\ninquired angrily for Mrs. Dethridge. Mrs. Dethridge not come back.\r\n\r\nIt was now late in the afternoon, and she had been out since the early\r\nmorning. This had never happened before. Vague suspicions of her, one\r\nmore monstrous than another, began to rise in Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s mind. Between\r\nthe drink and the fever, he had been (as Julius had told him) wandering\r\nin his mind during a part of the night. Had he let any thing out in that\r\ncondition? Had Hester heard it? And was it, by any chance, at the bottom\r\nof her long absence and her notice to quit? He determined--without\r\nletting her see that he suspected her--to clear up that doubt as soon as\r\nhis landlady returned to the house.\r\n\r\nThe evening came. It was past nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock before there was a ring at\r\nthe bell. The servant came to ask for the key. Geoffrey rose to go to\r\nthe gate himself--and changed his mind before he left the room. _Her_\r\nsuspicions might be roused (supposing it to be Hester who was waiting\r\nfor admission) if he opened the gate to her when the servant was there\r\nto do it. He gave the girl the key, and kept out of sight.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead tired!\xe2\x80\x9d--the servant said to herself, seeing her mistress by the\r\nlight of the lamp over the gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead tired!\xe2\x80\x9d--Geoffrey said to himself, observing Hester suspiciously\r\nas she passed him in the passage on her way up stairs to take off her\r\nbonnet in her own room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead tired!\xe2\x80\x9d--Anne said to herself, meeting Hester on the upper floor,\r\nand receiving from her a letter in Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s handwriting, delivered to\r\nthe mistress of the cottage by the postman, who had met her at her own\r\ngate.\r\n\r\nHaving given the letter to Anne, Hester Dethridge withdrew to her\r\nbedroom.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey closed the door of the drawing-room, in which the candles were\r\nburning, and went into the dining-room, in which there was no light.\r\nLeaving the door ajar, he waited to intercept his landlady on her way\r\nback to her supper in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nHester wearily secured her door, wearily lit the candles, wearily\r\nput the pen and ink on the table. For some minutes after this she was\r\ncompelled to sit down, and rally her strength and fetch her breath.\r\nAfter a little she was able to remove her upper clothing. This done she\r\ntook the manuscript inscribed, \xe2\x80\x9cMy Confession,\xe2\x80\x9d out of the secret pocket\r\nof her stays--turned to the last leaf as before--and wrote another\r\nentry, under the entry made on the previous night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning I gave him notice to quit, and offered him his money back\r\nif he wanted it. He refuses to go. He shall go to-morrow, or I will\r\nburn the place over his head. All through to-day I have avoided him by\r\nkeeping out of the house. No rest to ease my mind, and no sleep to close\r\nmy eyes. I humbly bear my cross as long as my strength will let me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt those words the pen dropped from her fingers. Her head nodded on\r\nher breast. She roused herself with a start. Sleep was the enemy she\r\ndreaded: sleep brought dreams.\r\n\r\nShe unfastened the window-shutters and looked out at the night. The\r\npeaceful moonlight was shining over the garden. The clear depths of the\r\nnight sky were soothing and beautiful to look at. What! Fading already?\r\nclouds? darkness? No! Nearly asleep once more. She roused herself again,\r\nwith a start. There was the moonlight, and there was the garden as\r\nbright under it as ever.\r\n\r\nDreams or no dreams, it was useless to fight longer against the\r\nweariness that overpowered her. She closed the shutters, and went back\r\nto the bed; and put her Confession in its customary place at night,\r\nunder her pillow.\r\n\r\nShe looked round the room--and shuddered. Every corner of it was filled\r\nwith the terrible memories of the past night. She might wake from the\r\ntorture of the dreams to find the terror of the Apparition watching at\r\nher bedside. Was there no remedy? no blessed safeguard under which she\r\nmight tranquilly resign herself to sleep? A thought crossed her mind.\r\nThe good book--the Bible. If she slept with the Bible under her pillow,\r\nthere was hope in the good book--the hope of sleeping in peace.\r\n\r\nIt was not worth while to put on the gown and the stays which she had\r\ntaken off. Her shawl would cover her. It was equally needless to take\r\nthe candle. The lower shutters would not be closed at that hour; and\r\nif they were, she could lay her hand on the Bible, in its place on the\r\nparlor book-shelf, in the dark.\r\n\r\nShe removed the Confession from under the pillow. Not even for a minute\r\ncould she prevail on herself to leave it in one room while she was away\r\nfrom it in another. With the manuscript folded up, and hidden in her\r\nhand, she slowly descended the stairs again. Her knees trembled under\r\nher. She was obliged to hold by the banister, with the hand that was\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey observed her from the dining-room, on her way down the stairs.\r\nHe waited to see what she did, before he showed himself, and spoke\r\nto her. Instead of going on into the kitchen, she stopped short, and\r\nentered the parlor. Another suspicious circumstance! What did she want\r\nin the parlor, without a candle, at that time of night?\r\n\r\nShe went to the book-case--her dark figure plainly visible in the\r\nmoonlight that flooded the little room. She staggered and put her\r\nhand to her head; giddy, to all appearance, from extreme fatigue. She\r\nrecovered herself, and took a book from the shelf. She leaned against\r\nthe wall after she had possessed herself of the book. Too weary, as it\r\nseemed, to get up stairs again without a little rest. Her arm-chair was\r\nnear her. Better rest, for a moment or two, to be had in that than could\r\nbe got by leaning against the wall. She sat down heavily in the chair,\r\nwith the book on her lap. One of her arms hung over the arm of the\r\nchair, with the hand closed, apparently holding something.\r\n\r\nHer head nodded on her breast--recovered itself--and sank gently on the\r\ncushion at the back of the chair. Asleep? Fast asleep.\r\n\r\nIn less than a minute the muscles of the closed hand that hung over\r\nthe arm of the chair slowly relaxed. Something white slipped out of her\r\nhand, and lay in the moonlight on the floor.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey took off his heavy shoes, and entered the room noiselessly in\r\nhis stockings. He picked up the white thing on the floor. It proved to\r\nbe a collection of several sheets of thin paper, neatly folded together,\r\nand closely covered with writing.\r\n\r\nWriting? As long as she was awake she had kept it hidden in her hand.\r\nWhy hide it?\r\n\r\nHad he let out any thing to compromise himself when he was light-headed\r\nwith the fever the night before? and had she taken it down in writing to\r\nproduce against him? Possessed by guilty distrust, even that monstrous\r\ndoubt assumed a look of probability to Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s mind. He left\r\nthe parlor as noiselessly as he had entered it, and made for the\r\ncandle-light in the drawing-room, determined to examine the manuscript\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\nAfter carefully smoothing out the folded leaves on the table, he turned\r\nto the first page, and read these lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIFTY-FOURTH.\r\n\r\nTHE MANUSCRIPT.\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY Confession: To be put into my coffin; and to be buried with me when\r\nI die.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the history of what I did in the time of my married life.\r\nHere--known to no other mortal creature, confessed to my Creator\r\nalone--is the truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the great day of the Resurrection, we shall all rise again in our\r\nbodies as we have lived. When I am called before the Judgment Seat I\r\nshall have this in my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, just and merciful Judge, Thou knowest what I have suffered. My\r\ntrust is in Thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the eldest of a large family, born of pious parents. We belonged\r\nto the congregation of the Primitive Methodists.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sisters were all married before me. I remained for some years the\r\nonly one at home. At the latter part of the time my mother\xe2\x80\x99s health\r\nfailed; and I managed the house in her place. Our spiritual pastor,\r\ngood Mr. Bapchild, used often to dine with us, on Sundays, between the\r\nservices. He approved of my management of the house, and, in particular,\r\nof my cooking. This was not pleasant to my mother, who felt a jealousy\r\nof my being, as it were, set over her in her place. My unhappiness at\r\nhome began in this way. My mother\xe2\x80\x99s temper got worse as her health got\r\nworse. My father was much away from us, traveling for his business. I\r\nhad to bear it all. About this time I began to think it would be well\r\nfor me if I could marry as my sisters had done; and have good Mr.\r\nBapchild to dinner, between the services, in a house of my own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this frame of mind I made acquaintance with a young man who attended\r\nservice at our chapel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis name was Joel Dethridge. He had a beautiful voice. When we\r\nsang hymns, he sang off the same book with me. By trade he was a\r\npaper-hanger. We had much serious talk together. I walked with him on\r\nSundays. He was a good ten years younger than I was; and, being only a\r\njourneyman, his worldly station was below mine. My mother found out the\r\nliking that had grown up between us. She told my father the next time\r\nhe was at home. Also my married sisters and my brothers. They all\r\njoined together to stop things from going further between me and Joel\r\nDethridge. I had a hard time of it. Mr. Bapchild expressed himself as\r\nfeeling much grieved at the turn things were taking. He introduced me\r\ninto a sermon--not by name, but I knew who it was meant for. Perhaps I\r\nmight have given way if they had not done one thing. They made inquiries\r\nof my young man\xe2\x80\x99s enemies, and brought wicked stories of him to me\r\nbehind his back. This, after we had sung off the same hymn-book, and\r\nwalked together, and agreed one with the other on religious subjects,\r\nwas too much to bear. I was of age to judge for myself. And I married\r\nJoel Dethridge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy relations all turned their backs on me. Not one of them was present\r\nat my marriage; my brother Reuben, in particular, who led the rest,\r\nsaying that they had done with me from that time forth. Mr. Bapchild was\r\nmuch moved; shed tears, and said he would pray for me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was married in London by a pastor who was a stranger; and we settled\r\nin London with fair prospects. I had a little fortune of my own--my\r\nshare of some money left to us girls by our aunt Hester, whom I was\r\nnamed after. It was three hundred pounds. Nearly one hundred of this I\r\nspent in buying furniture to fit up the little house we took to live in.\r\nThe rest I gave to my husband to put into the bank against the time when\r\nhe wanted it to set up in business for himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor three months, more or less, we got on nicely--except in one\r\nparticular. My husband never stirred in the matter of starting in\r\nbusiness for himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was once or twice cross with me when I said it seemed a pity to be\r\nspending the money in the bank (which might be afterward wanted) instead\r\nof earning more in business. Good Mr. Bapchild, happening about this\r\ntime to be in London, staid over Sunday, and came to dine with\r\nus between the services. He had tried to make my peace with my\r\nrelations--but he had not succeeded. At my request he spoke to my\r\nhusband about the necessity of exerting himself. My husband took it\r\nill. I then saw him seriously out of temper for the first time. Good Mr.\r\nBapchild said no more. He appeared to be alarmed at what had happened,\r\nand he took his leave early.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShortly afterward my husband went out. I got tea ready for him--but he\r\nnever came back. I got supper ready for him--but he never came back.\r\nIt was past twelve at night before I saw him again. I was very much\r\nstartled by the state he came home in. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak like himself, or\r\nlook like himself: he didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to know me--wandered in his mind, and\r\nfell all in a lump like on our bed. I ran out and fetched the doctor to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor pulled him up to the light, and looked at him; smelled his\r\nbreath, and dropped him down again on the bed; turned about, and stared\r\nat me. \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 I says. \xe2\x80\x98Do you mean to tell me you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know?\xe2\x80\x99 says the doctor. \xe2\x80\x98No, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 says I. \xe2\x80\x98Why what sort of a\r\nwoman are you,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98not to know a drunken man when you see him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nWith that he went away, and left me standing by the bedside, all in a\r\ntremble from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was how I first found out that I was the wife of a drunken man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have omitted to say any thing about my husband\xe2\x80\x99s family.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile we were keeping company together he told me he was an\r\norphan--with an uncle and aunt in Canada, and an only brother settled in\r\nScotland. Before we were married he gave me a letter from this brother.\r\nIt was to say that he was sorry he was not able to come to England, and\r\nbe present at my marriage, and to wish me joy and the rest of it. Good\r\nMr. Bapchild (to whom, in my distress, I wrote word privately of what\r\nhad happened) wrote back in return, telling me to wait a little, and see\r\nwhether my husband did it again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had not long to wait. He was in liquor again the next day, and the\r\nnext. Hearing this, Mr. Bapchild instructed me to send him the letter\r\nfrom my husband\xe2\x80\x99s brother. He reminded me of some of the stories about\r\nmy husband which I had refused to believe in the time before I was\r\nmarried; and he said it might be well to make inquiries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe end of the inquiries was this. The brother, at that very time,\r\nwas placed privately (by his own request) under a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s care to get\r\nbroken of habits of drinking. The craving for strong liquor (the doctor\r\nwrote) was in the family. They would be sober sometimes for months\r\ntogether, drinking nothing stronger than tea. Then the fit would seize\r\nthem; and they would drink, drink, drink, for days together, like the\r\nmad and miserable wretches that they were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was the husband I was married to. And I had offended all my\r\nrelations, and estranged them from me, for his sake. Here was surely a\r\nsad prospect for a woman after only a few months of wedded life!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a year\xe2\x80\x99s time the money in the bank was gone; and my husband was out\r\nof employment. He always got work--being a first-rate hand when he was\r\nsober--and always lost it again when the drinking-fit seized him. I was\r\nloth to leave our nice little house, and part with my pretty furniture;\r\nand I proposed to him to let me try for employment, by the day, as cook,\r\nand so keep things going while he was looking out again for work. He was\r\nsober and penitent at the time; and he agreed to what I proposed. And,\r\nmore than that, he took the Total Abstinence Pledge, and promised to\r\nturn over a new leaf. Matters, as I thought, began to look fairly again.\r\nWe had nobody but our two selves to think of. I had borne no child,\r\nand had no prospect of bearing one. Unlike most women, I thought this a\r\nmercy instead of a misfortune. In my situation (as I soon grew to know)\r\nmy becoming a mother would only have proved to be an aggravation of my\r\nhard lot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sort of employment I wanted was not to be got in a day. Good Mr.\r\nBapchild gave me a character; and our landlord, a worthy man (belonging,\r\nI am sorry to say, to the Popish Church), spoke for me to the steward of\r\na club. Still, it took time to persuade people that I was the thorough\r\ngood cook I claimed to be. Nigh on a fortnight had passed before I got\r\nthe chance I had been looking out for. I went home in good spirits (for\r\nme) to report what had happened, and found the brokers in the house\r\ncarrying off the furniture which I had bought with my own money for sale\r\nby auction. I asked them how they dared touch it without my leave. They\r\nanswered, civilly enough I must own, that they were acting under my\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s orders; and they went on removing it before my own eyes, to\r\nthe cart outside. I ran up stairs, and found my husband on the landing.\r\nHe was in liquor again. It is useless to say what passed between us. I\r\nshall only mention that this was the first occasion on which he lifted\r\nhis fist, and struck me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n5.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaving a spirit of my own, I was resolved not to endure it. I ran out\r\nto the Police Court, hard by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy money had not only bought the furniture--it had kept the house going\r\nas well; paying the taxes which the Queen and the Parliament asked for\r\namong other things. I now went to the magistrate to see what the Queen\r\nand the Parliament, in return for the taxes, would do for _me._\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Is your furniture settled on yourself?\xe2\x80\x99 he says, when I told him what\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand what he meant. He turned to some person who was\r\nsitting on the bench with him. \xe2\x80\x98This is a hard case,\xe2\x80\x99 he says. \xe2\x80\x98Poor\r\npeople in this condition of life don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what a marriage\r\nsettlement means. And, if they did, how many of them could afford to\r\npay the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s charges?\xe2\x80\x99 Upon that he turned to me. \xe2\x80\x98Yours is a common\r\ncase,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98In the present state of the law I can do nothing for\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was impossible to believe that. Common or not, I put my case to him\r\nover again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I have bought the furniture with my own money, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 I says. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmine, honestly come by, with bill and receipt to prove it. They are\r\ntaking it away from me by force, to sell it against my will. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nme that\xe2\x80\x99s the law. This is a Christian country. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My good creature,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98you are a married woman. The law\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow a married woman to call any thing her own--unless she has\r\npreviously (with a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s help) made a bargain to that effect with her\r\nhusband before marrying him. You have made no bargain. Your husband has\r\na right to sell your furniture if he likes. I am sorry for you; I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhinder him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was obstinate about it. \xe2\x80\x98Please to answer me this, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 I says.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told by wiser heads than mine that we all pay our taxes to\r\nkeep the Queen and the Parliament going; and that the Queen and the\r\nParliament make laws to protect us in return. I have paid my taxes. Why,\r\nif you please, is there no law to protect me in return?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t enter into that,\xe2\x80\x99 says he. \xe2\x80\x98I must take the law as I find it;\r\nand so must you. I see a mark there on the side of your face. Has your\r\nhusband been beating you? If he has, summon him here I can punish him\r\nfor _that._\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98How can you punish him, Sir?\xe2\x80\x99 says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I can fine him,\xe2\x80\x99 says he. \xe2\x80\x98Or I can send him to prison.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98As to the fine,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98he can pay that out of the money he gets\r\nby selling my furniture. As to the prison, while he\xe2\x80\x99s in it, what\xe2\x80\x99s to\r\nbecome of me, with my money spent by him, and my possessions gone; and\r\nwhen he\xe2\x80\x99s _out_ of it, what\xe2\x80\x99s to become of me again, with a husband\r\nwhom I have been the means of punishing, and who comes home to his wife\r\nknowing it? It\xe2\x80\x99s bad enough as it is, Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 says I. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s more that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbruised in me than what shows in my face. I wish you good-morning.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n6.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I got back the furniture was gone, and my husband was gone. There\r\nwas nobody but the landlord in the empty house. He said all that could\r\nbe said--kindly enough toward me, so far as I was concerned. When he was\r\ngone I locked my trunk, and got away in a cab after dark, and found a\r\nlodging to lay my head in. If ever there was a lonely, broken-hearted\r\ncreature in the world, I was that creature that night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was but one chance of earning my bread--to go to the employment\r\noffered me (under a man cook, at a club). And there was but one\r\nhope--the hope that I had lost sight of my husband forever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went to my work--and prospered in it--and earned my first quarter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwages. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not good for a woman to be situated as I was; friendless\r\nand alone, with her things that she took a pride in sold away from her,\r\nand with nothing to look forward to in her life to come. I was regular\r\nin my attendance at chapel; but I think my heart began to get hardened,\r\nand my mind to be overcast in secret with its own thoughts about this\r\ntime. There was a change coming. Two or three days after I had earned\r\nthe wages just mentioned my husband found me out. The furniture-money\r\nwas all spent. He made a disturbance at the club, I was only able\r\nto quiet him by giving him all the money I could spare from my own\r\nnecessities. The scandal was brought before the committee. They said, if\r\nthe circumstance occurred again, they should be obliged to part with me.\r\nIn a fortnight the circumstance occurred again. It\xe2\x80\x99s useless to dwell on\r\nit. They all said they were sorry for me. I lost the place. My husband\r\nwent back with me to my lodgings. The next morning I caught him taking\r\nmy purse, with the few shillings I had in it, out of my trunk, which\r\nhe had broken open. We quarreled. And he struck me again--this time\r\nknocking me down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went once more to the police court, and told my story--to another\r\nmagistrate this time. My only petition was to have my husband kept away\r\nfrom me. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a burden on others\xe2\x80\x99 (I says) \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto do any thing but what\xe2\x80\x99s right. I don\xe2\x80\x99t even complain of having been\r\nvery cruelly used. All I ask is to be let to earn an honest living. Will\r\nthe law protect me in the effort to do that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe answer, in substance, was that the law might protect me, provided I\r\nhad money to spend in asking some higher court to grant me a separation.\r\nAfter allowing my husband to rob me openly of the only property I\r\npossessed--namely, my furniture--the law turned round on me when I\r\ncalled upon it in my distress, and held out its hand to be paid. I had\r\njust three and sixpence left in the world--and the prospect, if I earned\r\nmore, of my husband coming (with permission of the law) and taking it\r\naway from me. There was only one chance--namely, to get time to turn\r\nround in, and to escape him again. I got a month\xe2\x80\x99s freedom from him,\r\nby charging him with knocking me down. The magistrate (happening to be\r\nyoung, and new to his business) sent him to prison, instead of fining\r\nhim. This gave me time to get a character from the club, as well as a\r\nspecial testimonial from good Mr. Bapchild. With the help of these, I\r\nobtained a place in a private family--a place in the country, this time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI found myself now in a haven of peace. I was among worthy kind-hearted\r\npeople, who felt for my distresses, and treated me most indulgently.\r\nIndeed, through all my troubles, I must say I have found one thing hold\r\ngood. In my experience, I have observed that people are oftener quick\r\nthan not to feel a human compassion for others in distress. Also, that\r\nthey mostly see plain enough what\xe2\x80\x99s hard and cruel and unfair on them in\r\nthe governing of the country which they help to keep going. But once ask\r\nthem to get on from sitting down and grumbling about it, to rising up\r\nand setting it right, and what do you find them? As helpless as a flock\r\nof sheep--that\xe2\x80\x99s what you find them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than six months passed, and I saved a little money again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne night, just as we were going to bed, there was a loud ring at the\r\nbell. The footman answered the door--and I heard my husband\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\nin the hall. He had traced me, with the help of a man he knew in the\r\npolice; and he had come to claim his rights. I offered him all the\r\nlittle money I had, to let me be. My good master spoke to him. It was\r\nall useless. He was obstinate and savage. If--instead of my running\r\noff from him--it had been all the other way and he had run off from me,\r\nsomething might have been done (as I understood) to protect me. But he\r\nstuck to his wife. As long as I could make a farthing, he stuck to his\r\nwife. Being married to him, I had no right to have left him; I was bound\r\nto go with my husband; there was no escape for me. I bade them good-by.\r\nAnd I have never forgotten their kindness to me from that day to this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband took me back to London.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs long as the money lasted, the drinking went on. When it was gone, I\r\nwas beaten again. Where was the remedy? There was no remedy, but to try\r\nand escape him once more. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t I have him locked up? What was the\r\ngood of having him locked up? In a few weeks he would be out of prison;\r\nsober and penitent, and promising amendment--and then when the fit took\r\nhim, there he would be, the same furious savage that he had been often\r\nand often before. My heart got hard under the hopelessness of it; and\r\ndark thoughts beset me, mostly at night. About this time I began to say\r\nto myself, \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s no deliverance from this, but in death--his death or\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce or twice I went down to the bridges after dark and looked over at\r\nthe river. No. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the sort of woman who ends her own wretchedness\r\nin that way. Your blood must be in a fever, and your head in a flame--at\r\nleast I fancy so--you must be hurried into it, like, to go and make away\r\nwith yourself. My troubles never took that effect on me. I always turned\r\ncold under them instead of hot. Bad for me, I dare say; but what you\r\nare--you are. Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his\r\nspots?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got away from him once more, and found good employment once more. It\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t matter how, and it don\xe2\x80\x99t matter where. My story is always the same\r\nthing, over and over again. Best get to the end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was one change, however, this time. My employment was not in a\r\nprivate family. I was also allowed to teach cookery to young women, in\r\nmy leisure hours. What with this, and what with a longer time passing\r\non the present occasion before my husband found me out, I was as\r\ncomfortably off as in my position I could hope to be. When my work was\r\ndone, I went away at night to sleep in a lodging of my own. It was only\r\na bedroom; and I furnished it myself--partly for the sake of economy\r\n(the rent being not half as much as for a furnished room); and partly\r\nfor the sake of cleanliness. Through all my troubles I always liked\r\nthings neat about me--neat and shapely and good.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s needless to say how it ended. He found me out again--this\r\ntime by a chance meeting with me in the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was in rags, and half starved. But that didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter now. All he\r\nhad to do was to put his hand into my pocket and take what he wanted.\r\nThere is no limit, in England, to what a bad husband may do--as long as\r\nhe sticks to his wife. On the present occasion, he was cunning enough to\r\nsee that he would be the loser if he disturbed me in my employment. For\r\na while things went on as smoothly as they could. I made a pretense that\r\nthe work was harder than usual; and I got leave (loathing the sight of\r\nhim, I honestly own) to sleep at the place where I was employed. This\r\nwas not for long. The fit took him again, in due course; and he came\r\nand made a disturbance. As before, this was not to be borne by decent\r\npeople. As before, they were sorry to part with me. As before, I lost my\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother woman would have gone mad under it. I fancy it just missed, by\r\na hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth, maddening Me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I looked at him that night, deep in his drunken sleep, I thought\r\nof Jael and Sisera (see the book of Judges; chapter 4th; verses 17 to\r\n21). It says, she \xe2\x80\x98took a nail of the tent, and took a hammer in her\r\nhand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples,\r\nand fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he\r\ndied.\xe2\x80\x99 She did this deed to deliver her nation from Sisera. If there had\r\nbeen a hammer and a nail in the room that night, I think I should have\r\nbeen Jael--with this difference, that I should have done it to deliver\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith the morning this passed off, for the time. I went and spoke to a\r\nlawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost people, in my place, would have had enough of the law already. But\r\nI was one of the sort who drain the cup to the dregs. What I said to him\r\nwas, in substance, this. \xe2\x80\x98I come to ask your advice about a madman. Mad\r\npeople, as I understand it, are people who have lost control over their\r\nown minds. Sometimes this leads them to entertaining delusions; and\r\nsometimes it leads them to committing actions hurtful to others or to\r\nthemselves. My husband has lost all control over his own craving for\r\nstrong drink. He requires to be kept from liquor, as other madmen\r\nrequire to be kept from attempting their own lives, or the lives of\r\nthose about them. It\xe2\x80\x99s a frenzy beyond his own control, with _him_--just\r\nas it\xe2\x80\x99s a frenzy beyond their own control, with _them._ There are\r\nAsylums for mad people, all over the country, at the public disposal, on\r\ncertain conditions. If I fulfill those conditions, will the law deliver\r\nme from the misery of being married to a madman, whose madness is\r\ndrink?\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 says the lawyer. \xe2\x80\x98The law of England declines to consider\r\nan incurable drunkard as a fit object for restraint, the law of England\r\nleaves the husbands and wives of such people in a perfectly helpless\r\nsituation, to deal with their own misery as they best can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made my acknowledgments to the gentleman and left him. The last\r\nchance was this chance--and this had failed me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thought that had once found its way into my mind already, now found\r\nits way back again, and never altogether left me from that time forth.\r\nNo deliverance for me but in death--his death, or mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had it before me night and day; in chapel and out of chapel just the\r\nsame. I read the story of Jael and Sisera so often that the Bible got to\r\nopen of itself at that place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe laws of my country, which ought to have protected me as an honest\r\nwoman, left me helpless. In place of the laws I had no friend near to\r\nopen my heart to. I was shut up in myself. And I was married to that\r\nman. Consider me as a human creature, and say, Was this not trying my\r\nhumanity very hardly?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wrote to good Mr. Bapchild. Not going into particulars; only telling\r\nhim I was beset by temptation, and begging him to come and help me. He\r\nwas confined to his bed by illness; he could only write me a letter\r\nof good advice. To profit by good advice people must have a glimpse\r\nof happiness to look forward to as a reward for exerting themselves.\r\nReligion itself is obliged to hold out a reward, and to say to us\r\npoor mortals, Be good, and you shall go to Heaven. I had no glimpse\r\nof happiness. I was thankful (in a dull sort of way) to good Mr.\r\nBapchild--and there it ended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time had been when a word from my old pastor would have put me in\r\nthe right way again. I began to feel scared by myself. If the next ill\r\nusage I received from Joel Dethridge found me an unchanged woman, it was\r\nborne in strongly on my mind that I should be as likely as not to get my\r\ndeliverance from him by my own hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoaded to it, by the fear of this, I humbled myself before my relations\r\nfor the first time. I wrote to beg their pardon; to own that they had\r\nproved to be right in their opinion of my husband; and to entreat them\r\nto be friends with me again, so far as to let me visit them from time\r\nto time. My notion was, that it might soften my heart if I could see the\r\nold place, and talk the old talk, and look again at the well-remembered\r\nfaces. I am almost ashamed to own it--but, if I had had any thing to\r\ngive, I would have parted with it all, to be allowed to go back into\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen and cook the Sunday dinner for them once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this was not to be. Not long before my letter was received mother\r\nhad died. They laid it all at my door. She had been ailing for years\r\npast, and the doctors had said it was hopeless from the first--but they\r\nlaid it all at my door. One of my sisters wrote to say that much, in\r\nas few words as could possibly suffice for saying it. My father never\r\nanswered my letter at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagistrates and lawyers; relations and friends; endurance of injuries,\r\npatience, hope, and honest work--I had tried all these, and tried them\r\nvainly. Look round me where I might, the prospect was closed on all\r\nsides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this time my husband had got a little work to do. He came home out\r\nof temper one night, and I gave him a warning. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t try me too far,\r\nJoel, for your own sake,\xe2\x80\x99 was all I said. It was one of his sober days;\r\nand, for the first time, a word from me seemed to have an effect on him.\r\nHe looked hard at me for a minute or so. And then he went and sat down\r\nin a corner, and held his peace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was on a Tuesday in the week. On the Saturday he got paid, and the\r\ndrinking fit took him again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn Friday in the next week I happened to come back late--having had\r\na good stroke of work to do that day, in the way of cooking a public\r\ndinner for a tavern-keeper who knew me. I found my husband gone, and\r\nthe bedroom stripped of the furniture which I had put into it. For the\r\nsecond time he had robbed me of my own property, and had turned it into\r\nmoney to be spent in drink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word. I stood and looked round the empty room. What was\r\ngoing on in me I hardly knew myself at the time, and can\xe2\x80\x99t describe now.\r\nAll I remember is, that, after a little, I turned about to leave the\r\nhouse. I knew the places where thy husband was likely to be found; and\r\nthe devil possessed me to go and find him. The landlady came out into\r\nthe passage and tried to stop me. She was a bigger and a stronger woman\r\nthan I was. But I shook her off like a child. Thinking over it now, I\r\nbelieve she was in no condition to put out her strength. The sight of me\r\nfrightened her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI found him. I said--well, I said what a woman beside herself with fury\r\nwould be likely to say. It\xe2\x80\x99s needless to tell how it ended. He knocked\r\nme down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter that, there is a spot of darkness like in my memory. The next\r\nthing I can call to mind, is coming back to my senses after some days.\r\nThree of my teeth were knocked out--but that was not the worst of it.\r\nMy head had struck against something in falling, and some part of me\r\n(a nerve, I think they said) was injured in such a way as to affect my\r\nspeech. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that I was downright dumb--I only mean that, all\r\nof a sudden, it had become a labor to me to speak. A long word was\r\nas serious an obstacle as if I was a child again. They took me to the\r\nhospital. When the medical gentlemen heard what it was, the medical\r\ngentlemen came crowding round me. I appeared to lay hold of their\r\ninterest, just as a story-book lays hold of the interest of other\r\npeople. The upshot of it was, that I might end in being dumb, or I might\r\nget my speech again--the chances were about equal. Only two things were\r\nneedful. One of them was that I should live on good nourishing diet. The\r\nother was, that I should keep my mind easy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout the diet it was not possible to decide. My getting good\r\nnourishing food and drink depended on my getting money to buy the same.\r\nAs to my mind, there was no difficulty about _that._ If my husband came\r\nback to me, my mind was made up to kill him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorrid--I am well aware this is horrid. Nobody else, in my place, would\r\nhave ended as wickedly as that. All the other women in the world, tried\r\nas I was, would have risen superior to the trial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n9.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have said that people (excepting my husband and my relations) were\r\nalmost always good to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe landlord of the house which we had taken when we were married heard\r\nof my sad case. He gave me one of his empty houses to look after, and a\r\nlittle weekly allowance for doing it. Some of the furniture in the upper\r\nrooms, not being wanted by the last tenant, was left to be taken at a\r\nvaluation if the next tenant needed it. Two of the servants\xe2\x80\x99 bedrooms\r\n(in the attics), one next to the other, had all that was wanted in them.\r\nSo I had a roof to cover me, and a choice of beds to lie on, and money\r\nto get me food. All well again--but all too late. If that house could\r\nspeak, what tales that house would have to tell of me!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had been told by the doctors to exercise my speech. Being all alone,\r\nwith nobody to speak to, except when the landlord dropped in, or when\r\nthe servant next door said, \xe2\x80\x98Nice day, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99 or, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel\r\nlonely?\xe2\x80\x99 or such like, I bought the newspaper, and read it out loud\r\nto myself to exercise my speech in that way. One day I came upon a bit\r\nabout the wives of drunken husbands. It was a report of something said\r\non that subject by a London coroner, who had held inquests on dead\r\nhusbands (in the lower ranks of life), and who had his reasons for\r\nsuspecting the wives. Examination of the body (he said) didn\xe2\x80\x99t prove it;\r\nand witnesses didn\xe2\x80\x99t prove it; but he thought it, nevertheless, quite\r\npossible, in some cases, that, when the woman could bear it no longer,\r\nshe sometimes took a damp towel, and waited till the husband (drugged\r\nwith his own liquor) was sunk in his sleep, and then put the towel over\r\nhis nose and mouth, and ended it that way without any body being the\r\nwiser. I laid down the newspaper; and fell into thinking. My mind was,\r\nby this time, in a prophetic way. I said to myself \xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t happened\r\non this for nothing: this means that I shall see my husband again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was then just after my dinner-time--two o\xe2\x80\x99clock. That same night,\r\nat the moment when I had put out my candle, and laid me down in bed, I\r\nheard a knock at the street door. Before I had lit my candle I says to\r\nmyself, \xe2\x80\x98Here he is.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI huddled on a few things, and struck a light, and went down stairs. I\r\ncalled out through the door, \xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x99 And his voice answered, \xe2\x80\x98Let\r\nme in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sat down on a chair in the passage, and shook all over like a person\r\nstruck with palsy. Not from the fear of him--but from my mind being in\r\nthe prophetic way. I knew I was going to be driven to it at last. Try as\r\nI might to keep from doing it, my mind told me I was to do it now. I sat\r\nshaking on the chair in the passage; I on one side of the door, and he\r\non the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knocked again, and again, and again. I knew it was useless to\r\ntry--and yet I resolved to try. I determined not to let him in till I\r\nwas forced to it. I determined to let him alarm the neighborhood, and\r\nto see if the neighborhood would step between us. I went up stairs and\r\nwaited at the open staircase window over the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe policeman came up, and the neighbors came out. They were all for\r\ngiving him into custody. The policeman laid hands on him. He had but one\r\nword to say; he had only to point up to me at the window, and to tell\r\nthem I was his wife. The neighbors went indoors again. The policeman\r\ndropped hold of his arm. It was I who was in the wrong, and not he. I\r\nwas bound to let my husband in. I went down stairs again, and let him\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing passed between us that night. I threw open the door of the\r\nbedroom next to mine, and went and locked myself into my own room. He\r\nwas dead beat with roaming the streets, without a penny in his pocket,\r\nall day long. The bed to lie on was all he wanted for that night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next morning I tried again--tried to turn back on the way that\r\nI was doomed to go; knowing beforehand that it would be of no use. I\r\noffered him three parts of my poor weekly earnings, to be paid to him\r\nregularly at the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s office, if he would only keep away from me,\r\nand from the house. He laughed in my face. As my husband, he could take\r\nall my earnings if he chose. And as for leaving the house, the house\r\noffered him free quarters to live in as long as I was employed to look\r\nafter it. The landlord couldn\xe2\x80\x99t part man and wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said no more. Later in the day the landlord came. He said if we could\r\nmake it out to live together peaceably he had neither the right nor\r\nthe wish to interfere. If we made any disturbances, then he should\r\nbe obliged to provide himself with some other woman to look after the\r\nhouse. I had nowhere else to go, and no other employment to undertake.\r\nIf, in spite of that, I had put on my bonnet and walked out, my husband\r\nwould have walked out after me. And all decent people would have patted\r\nhim on the back, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Quite right, good man--quite right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo there he was by his own act, and with the approval of others, in the\r\nsame house with me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made no remark to him or to the landlord. Nothing roused me now.\r\nI knew what was coming; I waited for the end. There was some change\r\nvisible in me to others, as I suppose, though not noticeable by myself,\r\nwhich first surprised my husband and then daunted him. When the next\r\nnight came I heard him lock the door softly in his own room. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmatter to me. When the time was ripe ten thousand locks wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lock\r\nout what was to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next day, bringing my weekly payment, brought me a step nearer on\r\nthe way to the end. Getting the money, he could get the drink. This\r\ntime he began cunningly--in other words, he began his drinking by slow\r\ndegrees. The landlord (bent, honest man, on trying to keep the peace\r\nbetween us) had given him some odd jobs to do, in the way of small\r\nrepairs, here and there about the house. \xe2\x80\x98You owe this,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98to\r\nmy desire to do a good turn to your poor wife. I am helping you for her\r\nsake. Show yourself worthy to be helped, if you can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said, as usual, that he was going to turn over a new leaf. Too late!\r\nThe time had gone by. He was doomed, and I was doomed. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter\r\nwhat he said now. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter when he locked his door again the\r\nlast thing at night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe next day was Sunday. Nothing happened. I went to chapel. Mere\r\nhabit. It did me no good. He got on a little with the drinking--but\r\nstill cunningly, by slow degrees. I knew by experience that this meant a\r\nlong fit, and a bad one, to come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonday, there were the odd jobs about the house to be begun. He was\r\nby this time just sober enough to do his work, and just tipsy enough to\r\ntake a spiteful pleasure in persecuting his wife. He went out and got\r\nthe things he wanted, and came back and called for me. A skilled workman\r\nlike he was (he said) wanted a journeyman under him. There were things\r\nwhich it was beneath a skilled workman to do for himself. He was not\r\ngoing to call in a man or a boy, and then have to pay them. He was going\r\nto get it done for nothing, and he meant to make a journeyman of _me._\r\nHalf tipsy and half sober, he went on talking like that, and laying out\r\nhis things, all quite right, as he wanted them. When they were ready he\r\nstraightened himself up, and he gave me his orders what I was to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI obeyed him to the best of my ability. Whatever he said, and whatever\r\nhe did, I knew he was going as straight as man could go to his own death\r\nby my hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rats and mice were all over the house, and the place generally was\r\nout of repair. He ought to have begun on the kitchen-floor; but (having\r\nsentence pronounced against him) he began in the empty parlors on the\r\nground-floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese parlors were separated by what is called a \xe2\x80\x98lath-and-plaster\r\nwall.\xe2\x80\x99 The rats had damaged it. At one part they had gnawed through\r\nand spoiled the paper, at another part they had not got so far. The\r\nlandlord\xe2\x80\x99s orders were to spare the paper, because he had some by him to\r\nmatch it. My husband began at a place where the paper was whole. Under\r\nhis directions I mixed up--I won\xe2\x80\x99t say what. With the help of it he got\r\nthe paper loose from the wall, without injuring it in any way, in a long\r\nhanging strip. Under it was the plaster and the laths, gnawed away in\r\nplaces by the rats. Though strictly a paperhanger by trade, he could be\r\nplasterer too when he liked. I saw how he cut away the rotten laths and\r\nripped off the plaster; and (under his directions again) I mixed up the\r\nnew plaster he wanted, and handed him the new laths, and saw how he set\r\nthem. I won\xe2\x80\x99t say a word about how this was done either.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a reason for keeping silence here, which is, to my mind, a very\r\ndreadful one. In every thing that my husband made me do that day he was\r\nshowing me (blindfold) the way to kill him, so that no living soul, in\r\nthe police or out of it, could suspect me of the deed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe finished the job on the wall just before dark. I went to my cup of\r\ntea, and he went to his bottle of gin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left him, drinking hard, to put our two bedrooms tidy for the night.\r\nThe place that his bed happened to be set in (which I had never remarked\r\nparticularly before) seemed, in a manner of speaking, to force itself on\r\nmy notice now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe head of the bedstead was set against the wall which divided his\r\nroom from mine. From looking at the bedstead I got to looking at the\r\nwall next. Then to wondering what it was made of. Then to rapping\r\nagainst it with my knuckles. The sound told me there was nothing but\r\nlath and plaster under the paper. It was the same as the wall we had\r\nbeen at work on down stairs. We had cleared our way so far through this\r\nlast--in certain places where the repairs were most needed--that we had\r\nto be careful not to burst through the paper in the room on the other\r\nside. I found myself calling to mind the caution my husband had given me\r\nwhile we were at this part of the work, word for word as he had spoken\r\nit. _\xe2\x80\x98Take care you don\xe2\x80\x99t find your hands in the next room.\xe2\x80\x99_ That\r\nwas what he had said down in the parlor. Up in his bedroom I kept on\r\nrepeating it in my own mind--with my eyes all the while on the key,\r\nwhich he had moved to the inner side of the door to lock himself\r\nin--till the knowledge of what it meant burst on me like a flash of\r\nlight. I looked at the wall, at the bedhead, at my own two hands--and I\r\nshivered as if it was winter time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHours must have passed like minutes while I was up stairs that night.\r\nI lost all count of time. When my husband came up from his drinking, he\r\nfound me in his room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n10.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI leave the rest untold, and pass on purposely to the next morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo mortal eyes but mine will ever see these lines. Still, there are\r\nthings a woman can\xe2\x80\x99t write of even to herself. I shall only say this.\r\nI suffered the last and worst of many indignities at my husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands--at the very time when I first saw, set plainly before me, the\r\nway to take his life. He went out toward noon next day, to go his rounds\r\namong the public houses; my mind being then strung up to deliver myself\r\nfrom him, for good and all, when he came back at night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe things we had used on the previous day were left in the parlor. I\r\nwas all by myself in the house, free to put in practice the lesson he\r\nhad taught me. I proved myself an apt scholar. Before the lamps were lit\r\nin the street I had my own way prepared (in my bedroom and in his)\r\nfor laying my own hands on him--after he had locked himself up for the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember feeling either fear or doubt through all those hours.\r\nI sat down to my bit of supper with no better and no worse an appetite\r\nthan usual. The only change in me that I can call to mind was that I\r\nfelt a singular longing to have somebody with me to keep me company.\r\nHaving no friend to ask in, I went to the street door and stood looking\r\nat the people passing this way and that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA stray dog, sniffing about, came up to me. Generally I dislike dogs\r\nand beasts of all kinds. I called this one in and gave him his supper.\r\nHe had been taught (I suppose) to sit up on his hind-legs and beg for\r\nfood; at any rate, that was his way of asking me for more. I laughed--it\r\nseems impossible when I look back at it now, but for all that it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntrue--I laughed till the tears ran down my cheeks, at the little beast\r\non his haunches, with his ears pricked up and his head on one side and\r\nhis mouth watering for the victuals. I wonder whether I was in my right\r\nsenses? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the dog had got all he could get he whined to be let out to roam\r\nthe streets again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I opened the door to let the creature go his ways, I saw my husband\r\ncrossing the road to come in. \xe2\x80\x98Keep out\xe2\x80\x99 (I says to him); \xe2\x80\x98to-night, of\r\nall nights, keep out.\xe2\x80\x99 He was too drunk to heed me; he passed by, and\r\nblundered his way up stairs. I followed and listened. I heard him open\r\nhis door, and bang it to, and lock it. I waited a bit, and went up\r\nanother stair or two. I heard him drop down on to his bed. In a minute\r\nmore he was fast asleep and snoring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt had all happened as it was wanted to happen. In two minutes--without\r\ndoing one single thing to bring suspicion on myself--I could have\r\nsmothered him. I went into my own room. I took up the towel that I\r\nhad laid ready. I was within an inch of it--when there came a rush of\r\nsomething up into my head. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say what it was. I can only say the\r\nhorrors laid hold of me and hunted me then and there out of the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI put on my bonnet, and slipped the key of the street door into my\r\npocket. It was only half past nine--or maybe a quarter to ten. If I had\r\nany one clear notion in my head, it was the notion of running away, and\r\nnever allowing myself to set eyes on the house or the husband more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went up the street--and came back. I went down the street--and came\r\nback. I tried it a third time, and went round and round and round--and\r\ncame back. It was not to be done The house held me chained to it like a\r\ndog to his kennel. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep away from it. For the life of me, I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep away from it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA company of gay young men and women passed me, just as I was going to\r\nlet myself in again. They were in a great hurry. \xe2\x80\x98Step out,\xe2\x80\x99 says one of\r\nthe men; \xe2\x80\x98the theatre\xe2\x80\x99s close by, and we shall be just in time for the\r\nfarce.\xe2\x80\x99 I turned about and followed them. Having been piously brought\r\nup, I had never been inside a theatre in my life. It struck me that I\r\nmight get taken, as it were, out of myself, if I saw something that was\r\nquite strange to me, and heard something which would put new thoughts\r\ninto my mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey went in to the pit; and I went in after them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thing they called the farce had begun. Men and women came on to the\r\nstage, turn and turn about, and talked, and went off again. Before long\r\nall the people about me in the pit were laughing and clapping their\r\nhands. The noise they made angered me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to describe the\r\nstate I was in. My eyes wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t serve me, and my ears wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t serve\r\nme, to see and to hear what the rest of them were seeing and hearing.\r\nThere must have been something, I fancy, in my mind that got itself\r\nbetween me and what was going on upon the stage. The play looked fair\r\nenough on the surface; but there was danger and death at the bottom of\r\nit. The players were talking and laughing to deceive the people--with\r\nmurder in their minds all the time. And nobody knew it but me--and my\r\ntongue was tied when I tried to tell the others. I got up, and ran out.\r\nThe moment I was in the street my steps turned back of themselves on the\r\nway to the house. I called a cab, and told the man to drive (as far as\r\na shilling would take me) the opposite way. He put me down--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhere. Across the street I saw an inscription in letters of flame over\r\nan open door. The man said it was a dancing-place. Dancing was as new to\r\nme as play-going. I had one more shilling left; and I paid to go in,\r\nand see what a sight of the dancing would do for me. The light from the\r\nceiling poured down in this place as if it was all on fire. The crashing\r\nof the music was dreadful. The whirling round and round of men and\r\nwomen in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms was quite maddening to see. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nhappened to me here. The great blaze of light from the ceiling turned\r\nblood-red on a sudden. The man standing in front of the musicians waving\r\na stick took the likeness of Satan, as seen in the picture in our family\r\nBible at home. The whirling men and women went round and round,\r\nwith white faces like the faces of the dead, and bodies robed in\r\nwinding-sheets. I screamed out with the terror of it; and some person\r\ntook me by the arm and put me outside the door. The darkness did me\r\ngood: it was comforting and delicious--like a cool hand laid on a hot\r\nhead. I went walking on through it, without knowing where; composing\r\nmy mind with the belief that I had lost my way, and that I should find\r\nmyself miles distant from home when morning dawned. After some time\r\nI got too weary to go on; and I sat me down to rest on a door-step.\r\nI dozed a bit, and woke up. When I got on my feet to go on again, I\r\nhappened to turn my head toward the door of the house. The number on it\r\nwas the same number an as ours. I looked again. And behold, it was our\r\nsteps I had been resting on. The door was our door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll my doubts and all my struggles dropped out of my mind when I made\r\nthat discovery. There was no mistaking what this perpetual coming back\r\nto the house meant. Resist it as I might, it was to be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI opened the street door and went up stairs, and heard him sleeping his\r\nheavy sleep, exactly as I had heard him when I went out. I sat down on\r\nmy bed and took off my bonnet, quite quiet in myself, because I knew it\r\nwas to be. I damped the towel, and put it ready, and took a turn in the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was just the dawn of day. The sparrows were chirping among the trees\r\nin the square hard by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI drew up my blind; the faint light spoke to me as if in words, \xe2\x80\x98Do it\r\nnow, before I get brighter, and show too much.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI listened. The friendly silence had a word for me too: \xe2\x80\x98Do it now, and\r\ntrust the secret to Me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI waited till the church clock chimed before striking the hour. At the\r\nfirst stroke--without touching the lock of his door, without setting\r\nfoot in his room--I had the towel over his face. Before the last stroke\r\nhe had ceased struggling. When the hum of the bell through the morning\r\nsilence was still and dead, _he_ was still and dead with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n11.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rest of this history is counted in my mind by four days--Wednesday,\r\nThursday, Friday, Saturday. After that it all fades off like, and the\r\nnew years come with a strange look, being the years of a new life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about the old life first? What did I feel, in the horrid quiet of\r\nthe morning, when I had done it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I felt. I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember it, or I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell it, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know which. I can write the history of the four days, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWednesday.--I gave the alarm toward noon. Hours before, I had put\r\nthings straight and fit to be seen. I had only to call for help, and to\r\nleave the people to do as they pleased. The neighbors came in, and then\r\nthe police. They knocked, uselessly, at his door. Then they broke it\r\nopen, and found him dead in his bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the ghost of a suspicion of me entered the mind of any one. There\r\nwas no fear of human justice finding me out: my one unutterable dread\r\nwas dread of an Avenging Providence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a short sleep that night, and a dream, in which I did the deed\r\nover again. For a time my mind was busy with thoughts of confessing\r\nto the police, and of giving myself up. If I had not belonged to a\r\nrespectable family, I should have done it. From generation to generation\r\nthere had been no stain on our good name. It would be death to my\r\nfather, and disgrace to all my family, if I owned what I had done, and\r\nsuffered for it on the public scaffold. I prayed to be guided; and I had\r\na revelation, toward morning, of what to do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was commanded, in a vision, to open the Bible, and vow on it to set\r\nmy guilty self apart among my innocent fellow-creatures from that day\r\nforth; to live among them a separate and silent life, to dedicate the\r\nuse of my speech to the language of prayer only, offered up in the\r\nsolitude of my own chamber when no human ear could hear me. Alone, in\r\nthe morning, I saw the vision, and vowed the vow. No human ear _has_\r\nheard me from that time. No human ear _will_ hear me, to the day of my\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThursday.--The people came to speak to me, as usual. They found me\r\ndumb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat had happened to me in the past, when my head had been hurt, and my\r\nspeech affected by it, gave a likelier look to my dumbness than it might\r\nhave borne in the case of another person. They took me back again to the\r\nhospital. The doctors were divided in opinion. Some said the shock\r\nof what had taken place in the house, coming on the back of the other\r\nshock, might, for all they knew, have done the mischief. And others\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98She got her speech again after the accident; there has been no\r\nnew injury since that time; the woman is shamming dumb, for some purpose\r\nof her own.\xe2\x80\x99 I let them dispute it as they liked. All human talk was\r\nnothing now to me. I had set myself apart among my fellow-creatures; I\r\nhad begun my separate and silent life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrough all this time the sense of a coming punishment hanging over\r\nme never left my mind. I had nothing to dread from human justice. The\r\njudgment of an Avenging Providence--there was what I was waiting for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriday--They held the inquest. He had been known for years past as an\r\ninveterate drunkard, he had been seen overnight going home in liquor; he\r\nhad been found locked up in his room, with the key inside the door, and\r\nthe latch of the window bolted also. No fire-place was in this garret;\r\nnothing was disturbed or altered: nobody by human possibility could have\r\ngot in. The doctor reported that he had died of congestion of the lungs;\r\nand the jury gave their verdict accordingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n12.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaturday.--Marked forever in my calendar as the memorable day on which\r\nthe judgment descended on me. Toward three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon--in\r\nthe broad sunlight, under the cloudless sky, with hundreds of innocent\r\nhuman creatures all around me--I, Hester Dethridge, saw, for the first\r\ntime, the Appearance which is appointed to haunt me for the rest of my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had had a terrible night. My mind felt much as it had felt on the\r\nevening when I had gone to the play. I went out to see what the air and\r\nthe sunshine and the cool green of trees and grass would do for me. The\r\nnearest place in which I could find what I wanted was the Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Park.\r\nI went into one of the quiet walks in the middle of the park, where the\r\nhorses and carriages are not allowed to go, and where old people can sun\r\nthemselves, and children play, without danger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sat me down to rest on a bench. Among the children near me was a\r\nbeautiful little boy, playing with a brand-new toy--a horse and wagon.\r\nWhile I was watching him busily plucking up the blades of grass and\r\nloading his wagon with them, I felt for the first time--what I have\r\noften and often felt since--a creeping chill come slowly over my flesh,\r\nand then a suspicion of something hidden near me, which would steal out\r\nand show itself if I looked that way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a big tree hard by. I looked toward the tree, and waited to\r\nsee the something hidden appear from behind it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Thing stole out, dark and shadowy in the pleasant sunlight. At\r\nfirst I saw only the dim figure of a woman. After a little it began to\r\nget plainer, brightening from within outward--brightening, brightening,\r\nbrightening, till it set before me the vision of MY OWN SELF, repeated\r\nas if I was standing before a glass--the double of myself, looking at me\r\nwith my own eyes. I saw it move over the grass. I saw it stop behind\r\nthe beautiful little boy. I saw it stand and listen, as I had stood and\r\nlistened at the dawn of morning, for the chiming of the bell before the\r\nclock struck the hour. When it heard the stroke it pointed down to the\r\nboy with my own hand; and it said to me, with my own voice, \xe2\x80\x98Kill him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA time passed. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it was a minute or an hour. The\r\nheavens and the earth disappeared from before me. I saw nothing but the\r\ndouble of myself, with the pointing hand. I felt nothing but the longing\r\nto kill the boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, as it seemed, the heavens and the earth rushed back upon me. I\r\nsaw the people near staring in surprise at me, and wondering if I was in\r\nmy right mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got, by main force, to my feet; I looked, by main force, away from\r\nthe beautiful boy; I escaped, by main force, from the sight of the\r\nThing, back into the streets. I can only describe the overpowering\r\nstrength of the temptation that tried me in one way. It was like tearing\r\nthe life out of me to tear myself from killing the boy. And what it was\r\non this occasion it has been ever since. No remedy against it but in\r\nthat torturing effort, and no quenching the after-agony but by solitude\r\nand prayer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sense of a coming punishment had hung over me. And the punishment\r\nhad come. I had waited for the judgment of an Avenging Providence.\r\nAnd the judgment was pronounced. With pious David I could now say, Thy\r\nfierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                          *****\r\n\r\nArrived at that point in the narrative, Geoffrey looked up from the\r\nmanuscript for the first time. Some sound outside the room had disturbed\r\nhim. Was it a sound in the passage?\r\n\r\nHe listened. There was an interval of silence. He looked back again at\r\nthe Confession, turning over the last leaves to count how much was left\r\nof it before it came to an end.\r\n\r\nAfter relating the circumstances under which the writer had returned to\r\ndomestic service, the narrative was resumed no more. Its few remaining\r\npages were occupied by a fragmentary journal. The brief entries referred\r\nto the various occasions on which Hester Dethridge had again and\r\nagain seen the terrible apparition of herself, and had again and again\r\nresisted the homicidal frenzy roused in her by the hideous creation of\r\nher own distempered brain. In the effort which that resistance cost her\r\nlay the secret of her obstinate determination to insist on being freed\r\nfrom her work at certain times, and to make it a condition with any\r\nmistress who employed her that she should be privileged to sleep in a\r\nroom of her own at night. Having counted the pages thus filled,\r\nGeoffrey turned back to the place at which he had left off, to read the\r\nmanuscript through to the end.\r\n\r\nAs his eyes rested on the first line the noise in the\r\npassage--intermitted for a moment only--disturbed him again.\r\n\r\nThis time there was no doubt of what the sound implied. He heard her\r\nhurried footsteps; he heard her dreadful cry. Hester Dethridge had woke\r\nin her chair in the pallor, and had discovered that the Confession was\r\nno longer in her own hands.\r\n\r\nHe put the manuscript into the breast-pocket of his coat. On _this_\r\noccasion his reading had been of some use to him. Needless to go on\r\nfurther with it. Needless to return to the Newgate Calendar. The problem\r\nwas solved.\r\n\r\nAs he rose to his feet his heavy face brightened slowly with a terrible\r\nsmile. While the woman\xe2\x80\x99s Confession was in his pocket the woman herself\r\nwas in his power. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she wants it back,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cshe must get it\r\non my terms.\xe2\x80\x9d With that resolution, he opened the door, and met Hester\r\nDethridge, face to face, in the passage.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIFTY-FIFTH.\r\n\r\nTHE SIGNS OF THE END.\r\n\r\nTHE servant, appearing the next morning in Anne\xe2\x80\x99s room with the\r\nbreakfast tray, closed the door with an air of mystery, and announced\r\nthat strange things were going on in the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear nothing last night, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cdown stairs in the\r\npassage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I heard some voices whispering outside my room,\xe2\x80\x9d Anne\r\nreplied. \xe2\x80\x9cHas any thing happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nExtricated from the confusion in which she involved it, the girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnarrative amounted in substance to this. She had been startled by the\r\nsudden appearance of her mistress in the passage, staring about her\r\nwildly, like a woman who had gone out of her senses. Almost at the same\r\nmoment \xe2\x80\x9cthe master\xe2\x80\x9d had flung open the drawing-room door. He had caught\r\nMrs. Dethridge by the arm, had dragged her into the room, and had closed\r\nthe door again. After the two had remained shut up together for more\r\nthan half an hour, Mrs. Dethridge had come out, as pale as ashes, and\r\nhad gone up stairs trembling like a person in great terror. Some time\r\nlater, when the servant was in bed, but not asleep, she had seen a light\r\nunder her door, in the narrow wooden passage which separated Anne\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedroom from Hester\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom, and by which she obtained access to her\r\nown little sleeping-chamber beyond. She had got out of bed; had looked\r\nthrough the keyhole; and had seen \xe2\x80\x9cthe master\xe2\x80\x9d and Mrs. Dethridge\r\nstanding together examining the walls of the passage. \xe2\x80\x9cThe master\xe2\x80\x9d had\r\nlaid his hand upon the wall, on the side of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s room, and had\r\nlooked at Mrs. Dethridge. And Mrs. Dethridge had looked back at him, and\r\nhad shaken her head. Upon that he had said in a whisper (still with his\r\nhand on the wooden wall), \xe2\x80\x9cNot to be done here?\xe2\x80\x9d And Mrs. Dethridge had\r\nshaken her head. He had considered a moment, and had whispered again,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other room will do! won\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d And Mrs. Dethridge had nodded her\r\nhead--and so they had parted. That was the story of the night. Early in\r\nthe morning, more strange things had happened. The master had gone out,\r\nwith a large sealed packet in his hand, covered with many stamps; taking\r\nhis own letter to the post, instead of sending the servant with it as\r\nusual. On his return, Mrs. Dethridge had gone out next, and had\r\ncome back with something in a jar which she had locked up in her own\r\nsitting-room. Shortly afterward, a working-man had brought a bundle of\r\nlaths, and some mortar and plaster of Paris, which had been carefully\r\nplaced together in a corner of the scullery. Last, and most remarkable\r\nin the series of domestic events, the girl had received permission to go\r\nhome and see her friends in the country, on that very day; having been\r\npreviously informed, when she entered Mrs. Dethridge\xe2\x80\x99s service, that\r\nshe was not to expect to have a holiday granted to her until after\r\nChristmas. Such were the strange things which had happened in the house\r\nsince the previous night. What was the interpretation to be placed on\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nThe right interpretation was not easy to discover.\r\n\r\nSome of the events pointed apparently toward coming repairs or\r\nalterations in the cottage. But what Geoffrey could have to do with\r\nthem (being at the time served with a notice to quit), and why Hester\r\nDethridge should have shown the violent agitation which had been\r\ndescribed, were mysteries which it was impossible to penetrate.\r\n\r\nAnne dismissed the girl with a little present and a few kind words.\r\nUnder other circumstances, the incomprehensible proceedings in the house\r\nmight have made her seriously uneasy. But her mind was now occupied by\r\nmore pressing anxieties. Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s second letter (received from Hester\r\nDethridge on the previous evening) informed her that Sir Patrick\r\npersisted in his resolution, and that he and his niece might be\r\nexpected, come what might of it, to present themselves at the cottage on\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\nAnne opened the letter, and looked at it for the second time. The\r\npassages relating to Sir Patrick were expressed in these terms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think, darling, you have any idea of the interest that you have\r\nroused in my uncle. Although he has not to reproach himself, as I have,\r\nwith being the miserable cause of the sacrifice that you have made, he\r\nis quite as wretched and quite as anxious about you as I am. We talk of\r\nnobody else. He said last night that he did not believe there was your\r\nequal in the world. Think of that from a man who has such terribly\r\nsharp eyes for the faults of women in general, and such a terribly sharp\r\ntongue in talking of them! I am pledged to secrecy; but I must tell you\r\none other thing, between ourselves. Lord Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s announcement\r\nthat his brother refuses to consent to a separation put my uncle almost\r\nbeside himself. If there is not some change for the better in your life\r\nin a few days\xe2\x80\x99 time, Sir Patrick will find out a way of his own--lawful\r\nor not, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care--for rescuing you from the dreadful position in\r\nwhich you are placed, and Arnold (with my full approval) will help him.\r\nAs we understand it, you are, under one pretense or another, kept a\r\nclose prisoner. Sir Patrick has already secured a post of observation\r\nnear you. He and Arnold went all round the cottage last night, and\r\nexamined a door in your back garden wall, with a locksmith to help them.\r\nYou will no doubt hear further about this from Sir Patrick himself. Pray\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t appear to know any thing of it when you see him! I am not in his\r\nconfidence--but Arnold is, which comes to the same thing exactly. You\r\nwill see us (I mean you will see my uncle and me) to-morrow, in spite\r\nof the brute who keeps you under lock and key. Arnold will not accompany\r\nus; he is not to be trusted (he owns it himself) to control his\r\nindignation. Courage, dearest! There are two people in the world to whom\r\nyou are inestimably precious, and who are determined not to let your\r\nhappiness be sacrificed. I am one of them, and (for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake keep\r\nthis a secret also!) Sir Patrick is the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAbsorbed in the letter, and in the conflict of opposite feelings which\r\nit roused--her color rising when it turned her thoughts inward on\r\nherself, and fading again when she was reminded by it of the coming\r\nvisit--Anne was called back to a sense of present events by the\r\nreappearance of the servant, charged with a message. Mr. Speedwell had\r\nbeen for some time in the cottage, and he was now waiting to see her\r\ndown stairs.\r\n\r\nAnne found the surgeon alone in the drawing-room. He apologized for\r\ndisturbing her at that early hour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was impossible for me to get to Fulham yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nI could only make sure of complying with Lord Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s request by\r\ncoming here before the time at which I receive patients at home. I have\r\nseen Mr. Delamayn, and I have requested permission to say a word to you\r\non the subject of his health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne looked through the window, and saw Geoffrey smoking his pipe--not\r\nin the back garden, as usual, but in front of the cottage, where he\r\ncould keep his eye on the gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he ill?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is seriously ill,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Speedwell. \xe2\x80\x9cI should not otherwise\r\nhave troubled you with this interview. It is a matter of professional\r\nduty to warn you, as his wife, that he is in danger. He may be seized at\r\nany moment by a paralytic stroke. The only chance for him--a very poor\r\none, I am bound to say--is to make him alter his present mode of life\r\nwithout loss of time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn one way he will be obliged to alter it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has received\r\nnotice from the landlady to quit this cottage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Speedwell looked surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you will find that the notice has been withdrawn,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can only assure you that Mr. Delamayn distinctly informed me, when I\r\nadvised change of air, that he had decided, for reasons of his own, on\r\nremaining here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(Another in the series of incomprehensible domestic events! Hester\r\nDethridge--on all other occasions the most immovable of women--had\r\nchanged her mind!)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSetting that aside,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded the surgeon, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are two preventive\r\nmeasures which I feel bound to suggest. Mr. Delamayn is evidently\r\nsuffering (though he declines to admit it himself) from mental anxiety.\r\nIf he is to have a chance for his life, that anxiety must be set at\r\nrest. Is it in your power to relieve it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not even in my power, Mr. Speedwell, to tell you what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe surgeon bowed, and went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe second caution that I have to give you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis to keep him\r\nfrom drinking spirits. He admits having committed an excess in that way\r\nthe night before last. In his state of health, drinking means literally\r\ndeath. If he goes back to the brandy-bottle--forgive me for saying it\r\nplainly; the matter is too serious to be trifled with--if he goes\r\nback to the brandy-bottle, his life, in my opinion, is not worth five\r\nminutes\xe2\x80\x99 purchase. Can you keep him from drinking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne answered sadly and plainly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no influence over him. The terms we are living on here--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Speedwell considerately stopped her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will see his brother on my way home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He looked for a moment at Anne. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are far from well yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nresumed. \xe2\x80\x9cCan I do any thing for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile I am living my present life, Mr. Speedwell, not even your skill\r\ncan help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe surgeon took his leave. Anne hurried back up stairs, before Geoffrey\r\ncould re-enter the cottage. To see the man who had laid her life\r\nwaste--to meet the vindictive hatred that looked furtively at her out\r\nof his eyes--at the moment when sentence of death had been pronounced on\r\nhim, was an ordeal from which every finer instinct in her nature shrank\r\nin horror.\r\n\r\nHour by hour, the morning wore on, and he made no attempt to communicate\r\nwith her, Stranger still, Hester Dethridge never appeared. The servant\r\ncame up stairs to say goodby; and went away for her holiday. Shortly\r\nafterward, certain sounds reached Anne\xe2\x80\x99s ears from the opposite side of\r\nthe passage. She heard the strokes of a hammer, and then a noise as of\r\nsome heavy piece of furniture being moved. The mysterious repairs were\r\napparently being begun in the spare room.\r\n\r\nShe went to the window. The hour was approaching at which Sir Patrick\r\nand Blanche might be expected to make the attempt to see her.\r\n\r\nFor the third time, she looked at the letter.\r\n\r\nIt suggested, on this occasion, a new consideration to her. Did the\r\nstrong measures which Sir Patrick had taken in secret indicate alarm\r\nas well as sympathy? Did he believe she was in a position in which\r\nthe protection of the law was powerless to reach her? It seemed just\r\npossible. Suppose she were free to consult a magistrate, and to own to\r\nhim (if words could express it) the vague presentiment of danger which\r\nwas then present in her mind--what proof could she produce to satisfy\r\nthe mind of a stranger? The proofs were all in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s favor.\r\nWitnesses could testify to the conciliatory words which he had spoken to\r\nher in their presence. The evidence of his mother and brother would show\r\nthat he had preferred to sacrifice his own pecuniary interests rather\r\nthan consent to part with her. She could furnish nobody with the\r\nsmallest excuse, in her case, for interfering between man and wife.\r\nDid Sir Patrick see this? And did Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s description of what he and\r\nArnold Brinkworth were doing point to the conclusion that they were\r\ntaking the law into their own hands in despair? The more she thought of\r\nit, the more likely it seemed.\r\n\r\nShe was still pursuing the train of thought thus suggested, when the\r\ngate-bell rang.\r\n\r\nThe noises in the spare room suddenly stopped.\r\n\r\nAnne looked out. The roof of a carriage was visible on the other side of\r\nthe wall. Sir Patrick and Blanche had arrived. After an interval Hester\r\nDethridge appeared in the garden, and went to the grating in the gate.\r\nAnne heard Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s voice, clear and resolute. Every word he said\r\nreached her ears through the open window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe so good as to give my card to Mr. Delamayn. Say that I bring him\r\na message from Holchester House, and that I can only deliver it at a\r\npersonal interview.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge returned to the cottage. Another, and a longer interval\r\nelapsed. At the end of the time, Geoffrey himself appeared in the front\r\ngarden, with the key in his hand. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s heart throbbed fast as she saw\r\nhim unlock the gate, and asked herself what was to follow.\r\n\r\nTo her unutterable astonishment, Geoffrey admitted Sir Patrick without\r\nthe slightest hesitation--and, more still, he invited Blanche to leave\r\nthe carriage and come in!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet by-gones be by-gones,\xe2\x80\x9d Anne heard him say to Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cI only\r\nwant to do the right thing. If it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing for visitors to come\r\nhere, so soon after my father\xe2\x80\x99s death, come, and welcome. My own notion\r\nwas, when you proposed it before, that it was wrong. I am not much\r\nversed in these things. I leave it to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA visitor who brings you messages from your mother and your brother,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Sir Patrick answered gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cis a person whom it is your duty to\r\nadmit, Mr. Delamayn, under any circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he ought to be none the less welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d added Blanche, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen he is\r\naccompanied by your wife\xe2\x80\x99s oldest and dearest friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey looked, in stolid submission, from one to the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not much versed in these things,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cI have said\r\nalready, I leave it to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were by this time close under Anne\xe2\x80\x99s window. She showed herself.\r\nSir Patrick took off his hat. Blanche kissed her hand with a cry of joy,\r\nand attempted to enter the cottage. Geoffrey stopped her--and called to\r\nhis wife to come down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! no!\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me go up to her in her room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe attempted for the second time to gain the stairs. For the second\r\ntime Geoffrey stopped her. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cshe is\r\ncoming down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne joined them in the front garden. Blanche flew into her arms and\r\ndevoured her with kisses. Sir Patrick took her hand in silence. For\r\nthe first time in Anne\xe2\x80\x99s experience of him, the bright, resolute,\r\nself-reliant old man was, for the moment, at a loss what to say, at a\r\nloss what to do. His eyes, resting on her in mute sympathy and interest,\r\nsaid plainly, \xe2\x80\x9cIn your husband\xe2\x80\x99s presence I must not trust myself to\r\nspeak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you go into the drawing-room?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, looking with steady\r\nattention at his wife and Blanche.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s voice appeared to rouse Sir Patrick. He raised his head--he\r\nlooked like himself again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy go indoors this lovely weather?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose we take a turn\r\nin the garden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBlanche pressed Anne\xe2\x80\x99s hand significantly. The proposal was evidently\r\nmade for a purpose. They turned the corner of the cottage and gained the\r\nlarge garden at the back--the two ladies walking together, arm in arm;\r\nSir Patrick and Geoffrey following them. Little by little, Blanche\r\nquickened her pace. \xe2\x80\x9cI have got my instructions,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered to Anne.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get out of his hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was more easily said than done. Geoffrey kept close behind them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider my lameness, Mr. Delamayn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cNot quite so\r\nfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was well intended. But Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s cunning had taken the alarm.\r\nInstead of dropping behind with Sir Patrick, he called to his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s lameness,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cNot quite so fast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick met that check with characteristic readiness. When\r\nAnne slackened her pace, he addressed himself to Geoffrey, stopping\r\ndeliberately in the middle of the path. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me give you my message from\r\nHolchester House,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The two ladies were still slowly walking on.\r\nGeoffrey was placed between the alternatives of staying with Sir Patrick\r\nand leaving them by themselves--or of following them and leaving Sir\r\nPatrick. Deliberately, on his side, he followed the ladies.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick called him back. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you I wished to speak to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid, sharply.\r\n\r\nDriven to bay, Geoffrey openly revealed his resolution to give Blanche\r\nno opportunity of speaking in private to Anne. He called to Anne to\r\nstop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no secrets from my wife,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I expect my wife to have\r\nno secrets from me. Give me the message in her hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s eyes brightened with indignation. He controlled himself,\r\nand looked for an instant significantly at his niece before he spoke to\r\nGeoffrey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you please,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYour brother requests me to tell you that\r\nthe duties of the new position in which he is placed occupy the whole\r\nof his time, and will prevent him from returning to Fulham, as he had\r\nproposed, for some days to come. Lady Holchester, hearing that I was\r\nlikely to see you, has charged me with another message, from herself.\r\nShe is not well enough to leave home; and she wishes to see you at\r\nHolchester House to-morrow--accompanied (as she specially desires) by\r\nMrs. Delamayn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn giving the two messages, he gradually raised his voice to a louder\r\ntone than usual. While he was speaking, Blanche (warned to follow her\r\ninstructions by the glance her uncle had cast at her) lowered her voice,\r\nand said to Anne:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t consent to the separation as long as he has got you here. He\r\nis trying for higher terms. Leave him, and he must submit. Put a candle\r\nin your window, if you can get into the garden to-night. If not, any\r\nother night. Make for the back gate in the wall. Sir Patrick and Arnold\r\nwill manage the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe slipped those words into Anne\xe2\x80\x99s ears--swinging her parasol to\r\nand fro, and looking as if the merest gossip was dropping from her\r\nlips--with the dexterity which rarely fails a woman when she is called\r\non to assist a deception in which her own interests are concerned.\r\nCleverly as it had been done, however, Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s inveterate distrust\r\nwas stirred into action by it. Blanche had got to her last sentence\r\nbefore he was able to turn his attention from what Sir Patrick was\r\nsaying to what his niece was saying. A quicker man would have heard\r\nmore. Geoffrey had only distinctly heard the first half of the last\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cabout Sir Patrick and Arnold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing very interesting to you,\xe2\x80\x9d Blanche answered, readily. \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\nrepeat it if you like. I was telling Anne about my step-mother,\r\nLady Lundie. After what happened that day in Portland Place, she has\r\nrequested Sir Patrick and Arnold to consider themselves, for the future,\r\nas total strangers to her. That\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey, eying her narrowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk my uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Blanche, \xe2\x80\x9cif you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that I have\r\nreported her correctly. She gave us all our dismissal, in her most\r\nmagnificent manner, and in those very words. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t she, Sir Patrick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly true. Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s readiness of resource had met the\r\nemergency of the moment by describing something, in connection with Sir\r\nPatrick and Arnold, which had really happened. Silenced on one side, in\r\nspite of himself, Geoffrey was at the same moment pressed on the other\r\nfor an answer to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s message.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must take your reply to Lady Holchester,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir Patrick. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is\r\nit to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey looked hard at him, without making any reply.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick repeated the message--with a special emphasis on that part\r\nof it which related to Anne. The emphasis roused Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s temper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou and my mother have made that message up between you, to try me!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nburst out. \xe2\x80\x9cDamn all underhand work is what _I_ say!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am waiting for your answer,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Sir Patrick, steadily ignoring\r\nthe words which had just been addressed to him.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey glanced at Anne, and suddenly recovered himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy love to my mother,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go to her to-morrow--and take\r\nmy wife with me, with the greatest pleasure. Do you hear that? With the\r\ngreatest pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d He stopped to observe the effect of his reply. Sir\r\nPatrick waited impenetrably to hear more--if he had more to say. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsorry I lost my temper just now,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed \xe2\x80\x9cI am badly treated--I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ndistrusted without a cause. I ask you to bear witness,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, his\r\nvoice getting louder again, while his eyes moved uneasily backward and\r\nforward between Sir Patrick and Anne, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I treat my wife as becomes a\r\nlady. Her friend calls on her--and she\xe2\x80\x99s free to receive her friend. My\r\nmother wants to see her--and I promise to take her to my mother\xe2\x80\x99s. At\r\ntwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock to-morrow. Where am I to blame? You stand there looking at\r\nme, and saying nothing. Where am I to blame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf a man\xe2\x80\x99s own conscience justifies him, Mr. Delamayn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sir\r\nPatrick, \xe2\x80\x9cthe opinions of others are of very little importance. My\r\nerrand here is performed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he turned to bid Anne farewell, the uneasiness that he felt at\r\nleaving her forced its way to view. The color faded out of his face. His\r\nhand trembled as it closed tenderly and firmly on hers. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall see you\r\nto-morrow, at Holchester House,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; giving his arm while he spoke\r\nto Blanche. He took leave of Geoffrey, without looking at him again, and\r\nwithout seeing his offered hand. In another minute they were gone.\r\n\r\nAnne waited on the lower floor of the cottage while Geoffrey closed\r\nand locked the gate. She had no wish to appear to avoid him, after the\r\nanswer that he had sent to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s message. He returned slowly\r\nhalf-way across the front garden, looked toward the passage in which she\r\nwas standing, passed before the door, and disappeared round the corner\r\nof the cottage on his way to the back garden. The inference was not to\r\nbe mistaken. It was Geoffrey who was avoiding _her._ Had he lied to Sir\r\nPatrick? When the next day came would he find reasons of his own for\r\nrefusing to take her to Holchester House?\r\n\r\nShe went up stairs. At the same moment Hester Dethridge opened her\r\nbedroom door to come out. Observing Anne, she closed it again and\r\nremained invisible in her room. Once more the inference was not to be\r\nmistaken. Hester Dethridge, also, had her reasons for avoiding Anne.\r\n\r\nWhat did it mean? What object could there be in common between Hester\r\nand Geoffrey?\r\n\r\nThere was no fathoming the meaning of it. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts reverted to\r\nthe communication which had been secretly made to her by Blanche. It\r\nwas not in womanhood to be insensible to such devotion as Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconduct implied. Terrible as her position had become in its ever-growing\r\nuncertainty, in its never-ending suspense, the oppression of it yielded\r\nfor the moment to the glow of pride and gratitude which warmed her\r\nheart, as she thought of the sacrifices that had been made, of the\r\nperils that were still to be encountered, solely for her sake. To\r\nshorten the period of suspense seemed to be a duty which she owed to Sir\r\nPatrick, as well as to herself. Why, in her situation, wait for what the\r\nnext day might bring forth? If the opportunity offered, she determined\r\nto put the signal in the window that night.\r\n\r\nToward evening she heard once more the noises which appeared to indicate\r\nthat repairs of some sort were going on in the house. This time the\r\nsounds were fainter; and they came, as she fancied, not from the spare\r\nroom, as before, but from Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s room, next to it.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was later than usual that day. Hester Dethridge did not\r\nappear with the tray till dusk. Anne spoke to her, and received a mute\r\nsign in answer. Determined to see the woman\xe2\x80\x99s face plainly, she put\r\na question which required a written answer on the slate; and, telling\r\nHester to wait, went to the mantle-piece to light her candle. When she\r\nturned round with the lighted candle in her hand, Hester was gone.\r\n\r\nNight came. She rang her bell to have the tray taken away. The fall of\r\na strange footstep startled her outside her door. She called out, \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x9d The voice of the lad whom Geoffrey employed to go on errands for\r\nhim answered her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want here?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, through the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Delamayn sent me up, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. He wishes to speak to you directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne found Geoffrey in the dining-room. His object in wishing to speak\r\nto her was, on the surface of it, trivial enough. He wanted to know\r\nhow she would prefer going to Holchester House on the next day--by the\r\nrailway, or in a carriage. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you prefer driving,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe boy\r\nhas come here for orders, and he can tell them to send a carriage from\r\nthe livery-stables, as he goes home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe railway will do perfectly well for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Anne replied.\r\n\r\nInstead of accepting the answer, and dropping the subject, he asked her\r\nto reconsider her decision. There was an absent, uneasy expression in\r\nhis eye as he begged her not to consult economy at the expense of her\r\nown comfort. He appeared to have some reason of his own for preventing\r\nher from leaving the room. \xe2\x80\x9cSit d own a minute, and think before you\r\ndecide,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Having forced her to take a chair, he put his head\r\noutside the door and directed the lad to go up stairs, and see if he had\r\nleft his pipe in his bedroom. \xe2\x80\x9cI want you to go in comfort, as a lady\r\nshould,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, with the uneasy look more marked than ever. Before\r\nAnne could reply, the lad\xe2\x80\x99s voice reached them from the bedroom floor,\r\nraised in shrill alarm, and screaming \xe2\x80\x9cFire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeoffrey ran up stairs. Anne followed him. The lad met them at the\r\ntop of the stairs. He pointed to the open door of Anne\xe2\x80\x99s room. She was\r\nabsolutely certain of having left her lighted candle, when she went down\r\nto Geoffrey, at a safe distance from the bed-curtains. The bed-curtains,\r\nnevertheless, were in a blaze of fire.\r\n\r\nThere was a supply of water to the cottage, on the upper floor. The\r\nbedroom jugs and cans usually in their places at an earlier hour, were\r\nstanding that night at the cistern. An empty pail was left near them.\r\nDirecting the lad to bring him water from these resources, Geoffrey tore\r\ndown the curtains in a flaming heap, partly on the bed and partly on the\r\nsofa near it. Using the can and the pail alternately, as the boy brought\r\nthem, he drenched the bed and the sofa. It was all over in little\r\nmore than a minute. The cottage was saved. But the bed-furniture\r\nwas destroyed; and the room, as a matter of course, was rendered\r\nuninhabitable, for that night at least, and probably for more nights to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey set down the empty pail; and, turning to Anne, pointed across\r\nthe passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t be much inconvenienced by this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have only to\r\nshift your quarters to the spare room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of the lad, he moved Anne\xe2\x80\x99s boxes, and the chest of\r\ndrawers, which had escaped damage, into the opposite room. This done,\r\nhe cautioned her to be careful with her candles for the future--and went\r\ndown stairs, without waiting to hear what she said in reply. The lad\r\nfollowed him, and was dismissed for the night.\r\n\r\nEven in the confusion which attended the extinguishing of the fire, the\r\nconduct of Hester Dethridge had been remarkable enough to force itself\r\non the attention of Anne.\r\n\r\nShe had come out from her bedroom, when the alarm was given; had looked\r\nat the flaming curtains; and had drawn back, stolidly submissive, into\r\na corner to wait the event. There she had stood--to all appearance,\r\nutterly indifferent to the possible destruction of her own cottage. The\r\nfire extinguished, she still waited impenetrably in her corner, while\r\nthe chest of drawers and the boxes were being moved--then locked the\r\ndoor, without even a passing glance at the scorched ceiling and the\r\nburned bed-furniture--put the key into her pocket--and went back to her\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nAnne had hitherto not shared the conviction felt by most other persons\r\nwho were brought into contact with Hester Dethridge, that the woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind was deranged. After what she had just seen, however, the general\r\nimpression became her impression too. She had thought of putting certain\r\nquestions to Hester, when they were left together, as to the origin of\r\nthe fire. Reflection decided her on saying nothing, for that night at\r\nleast. She crossed the passage, and entered the spare room--the room\r\nwhich she had declined to occupy on her arrival at the cottage, and\r\nwhich she was obliged to sleep in now.\r\n\r\nShe was instantly struck by a change in the disposition of the furniture\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\nThe bed had been moved. The head--set, when she had last seen it,\r\nagainst the side wall of the cottage--was placed now against the\r\npartition wall which separated the room from Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s room. This new\r\narrangement had evidently been effected with a settled purpose of some\r\nsort. The hook in the ceiling which supported the curtains (the bed,\r\nunlike the bed in the other room, having no canopy attached to it) had\r\nbeen moved so as to adapt itself to the change that had been made. The\r\nchairs and the washhand-stand, formerly placed against the partition\r\nwall, were now, as a matter of necessity, shifted over to the vacant\r\nspace against the side wall of the cottage. For the rest, no other\r\nalteration was visible in any part of the room.\r\n\r\nIn Anne\xe2\x80\x99s situation, any event not immediately intelligible on the face\r\nof it, was an event to be distrusted. Was there a motive for the change\r\nin the position of the bed? And was it, by any chance, a motive in which\r\nshe was concerned?\r\n\r\nThe doubt had barely occurred to her, before a startling suspicion\r\nsucceeded it. Was there some secret purpose to be answered by making her\r\nsleep in the spare room? Did the question which the servant had heard\r\nGeoffrey put to Hester, on the previous night, refer to this? Had the\r\nfire which had so unaccountably caught the curtains in her own room,\r\nbeen, by any possibility, a fire purposely kindled, to force her out?\r\n\r\nShe dropped into the nearest chair, faint with horror, as those three\r\nquestions forced themselves in rapid succession on her mind.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting a little, she recovered self-possession enough to\r\nrecognize the first plain necessity of putting her suspicions to the\r\ntest. It was possible that her excited fancy had filled her with a\r\npurely visionary alarm. For all she knew to the contrary, there might be\r\nsome undeniably sufficient reason for changing the position of the bed.\r\nShe went out, and knocked at the door of Hester Dethridge\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to speak to you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHester came out. Anne pointed to the spare room, and led the way to it.\r\nHester followed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you changed the place of the bed,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the wall\r\nthere, to the wall here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStolidly submissive to the question, as she had been stolidly submissive\r\nto the fire, Hester Dethridge wrote her reply. On all other occasions\r\nshe was accustomed to look the persons to whom she offered her slate\r\nsteadily in the face. Now, for the first time, she handed it to Anne\r\nwith her eyes on the floor. The one line written contained no direct\r\nanswer: the words were these:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have meant to move it, for some time past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask you why you have moved it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe wrote these four words on the slate: \xe2\x80\x9cThe wall is damp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne looked at the wall. There was no sign of damp on the paper. She\r\npassed her hand over it. Feel where she might, the wall was dry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not your reason,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nHester stood immovable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no dampness in the wall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester pointed persistently with her pencil to the four words, still\r\nwithout looking up--waited a moment for Anne to read them again--and\r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\nIt was plainly useless to call her back. Anne\xe2\x80\x99s first impulse when she\r\nwas alone again was to secure the door. She not only locked it, but\r\nbolted it at top and bottom. The mortise of the lock and the staples\r\nof the bolts, when she tried them, were firm. The lurking\r\ntreachery--wherever else it might be--was not in the fastenings of the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nShe looked all round the room; examining the fire place, the window and\r\nits shutters, the interior of the wardrobe, the hidden space under the\r\nbed. Nothing was any where to be discovered which could justify the most\r\ntimid person living in feeling suspicion or alarm.\r\n\r\nAppearances, fair as they were, failed to convince her. The presentiment\r\nof some hidden treachery, steadily getting nearer and nearer to her in\r\nthe dark, had rooted itself firmly in her mind. She sat down, and tried\r\nto trace her way back to the clew, through the earlier events of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe effort was fruitless: nothing definite, nothing tangible, rewarded\r\nit. Worse still, a new doubt grew out of it--a doubt whether the motive\r\nwhich Sir Patrick had avowed (through Blanche) was the motive for\r\nhelping her which was really in his mind.\r\n\r\nDid he sincerely believe Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s conduct to be animated by no worse\r\nobject than a mercenary object? and was his only purpose in planning to\r\nremove her out of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s reach, to force Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s consent to\r\ntheir separation on the terms which Julius had proposed? Was this really\r\nthe sole end that he had in view? or was he secretly convinced (knowing\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s position as he knew it) that she was in personal danger at the\r\ncottage? and had he considerately kept that conviction concealed, in\r\nthe fear that he might otherwise encourage her to feel alarmed about\r\nherself? She looked round the strange room, in the silence of the\r\nnight, and she felt that the latter interpretation was the likeliest\r\ninterpretation of the two.\r\n\r\nThe sounds caused by the closing of the doors and windows reached her\r\nfrom the ground-floor. What was to be done?\r\n\r\nIt was impossible, to show the signal which had been agreed on to Sir\r\nPatrick and Arnold. The window in which they expected to see it was\r\nthe window of the room in which the fire had broken out--the room which\r\nHester Dethridge had locked up for the night.\r\n\r\nIt was equally hopeless to wait until the policeman passed on his beat,\r\nand to call for help. Even if she could prevail upon herself to make\r\nthat open acknowledgment of distrust under her husband\xe2\x80\x99s roof, and even\r\nif help was near, what valid reason could she give for raising an alarm?\r\nThere was not the shadow of a reason to justify any one in placing her\r\nunder the protection of the law.\r\n\r\nAs a last resource, impelled by her blind distrust of the change in the\r\nposition of the bed, she attempted to move it. The utmost exertion of\r\nher strength did not suffice to stir the heavy piece of furniture out of\r\nits place, by so much as a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth.\r\n\r\nThere was no alternative but to trust to the security of the locked\r\nand bolted door, and to keep watch through the night--certain that Sir\r\nPatrick and Arnold were, on their part, also keeping watch in the near\r\nneighborhood of the cottage. She took out her work and her books; and\r\nreturned to her chair, placing it near the table, in the middle of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe last noises which told of life and movement about her died away. The\r\nbreathless stillness of the night closed round her.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIFTY-SIXTH.\r\n\r\nTHE MEANS.\r\n\r\nTHE new day dawned; the sun rose; the household was astir again. Inside\r\nthe spare room, and outside the spare room, nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nAt the hour appointed for leaving the cottage to pay the promised visit\r\nto Holchester House, Hester Dethridge and Geoffrey were alone together\r\nin the bedroom in which Anne had passed the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s dressed, and waiting for me in the front garden,\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wanted to see me here alone. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester pointed to the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want it moved from the wall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester nodded her head.\r\n\r\nThey moved the bed some feet away from the partition wall. After a\r\nmomentary pause, Geoffrey spoke again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be done to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHer friends may interfere; the\r\ngirl may come back. It must be done to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester bowed her head slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long do you want to be left by yourself in the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held up three of her fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes that mean three hours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it be done in that time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made the affirmative sign once more.\r\n\r\nThus far, she had never lifted her eyes to his. In her manner of\r\nlistening to him when he spoke, in the slightest movement that she made\r\nwhen necessity required it, the same lifeless submission to him, the\r\nsame mute horror of him, was expressed. He had, thus far, silently\r\nresented this, on his side. On the point of leaving the room the\r\nrestraint which he had laid on himself gave way. For the first time, he\r\nresented it in words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy the devil can\xe2\x80\x99t you look at me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\n\r\nShe let the question pass, without a sign to show that she had heard\r\nhim. He angrily repeated it. She wrote on her slate, and held it out to\r\nhim--still without raising her eyes to his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know you can speak,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I have found you out.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use of playing the fool with _me?_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe persisted in holding the slate before him. He read these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am dumb to you, and blind to you. Let me be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet you be!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a little late in the day to be\r\nscrupulous, after what you have done. Do you want your Confession back,\r\nor not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the reference to the Confession passed his lips, she raised her head.\r\nA faint tinge of color showed itself on her livid cheeks; a momentary\r\nspasm of pain stirred her deathlike face. The one last interest left in\r\nthe woman\xe2\x80\x99s life was the interest of recovering the manuscript which\r\nhad been taken from her. To _that_ appeal the stunned intelligence still\r\nfaintly answered--and to no other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember the bargain on your side,\xe2\x80\x9d Geoffrey went on, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nremember the bargain on mine. This is how it stands, you know. I have\r\nread your Confession; and I find one thing wanting. You don\xe2\x80\x99t tell how\r\nit was done. I know you smothered him--but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how. I want to\r\nknow. You\xe2\x80\x99re dumb; and you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me. You must do to the wall here\r\nwhat you did in the other house. You run no risks. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t a soul\r\nto see you. You have got the place to yourself. When I come back let me\r\nfind this wall like the other wall--at that small hour of the morning\r\nyou know, when you were waiting, with the towel in your hand, for the\r\nfirst stroke of the clock. Let me find that; and to-morrow you shall\r\nhave your Confession back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the reference to the Confession passed his lips for the second time,\r\nthe sinking energy in the woman leaped up in her once more. She snatched\r\nher slate from her side; and, writing on it rapidly, held it, with both\r\nhands, close under his eyes. He read these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t wait. I must have it to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I keep your Confession about me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Geoffrey. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t even got it in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe staggered back; and looked up for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t alarm yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s sealed up with my seal; and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s safe in my bankers\xe2\x80\x99 keeping. I posted it to them myself. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstick at a trifle, Mrs. Dethridge. If I had kept it locked up in the\r\nhouse, you might have forced the lock when my back was turned. If I had\r\nkept it about me--I might have had that towel over my face, in the\r\nsmall hours of the morning! The bankers will give you back your\r\nConfession--just as they have received it from me--on receipt of an\r\norder in my handwriting. Do what I have told you; and you shall have the\r\norder to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe passed her apron over her face, and drew a long breath of relief.\r\nGeoffrey turned to the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will be back at six this evening,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cShall I find it done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bowed her head.\r\n\r\nHis first condition accepted, he proceeded to the second.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the opportunity offers,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall go up to my room. I\r\nshall ring the dining room bell first. You will go up before me when you\r\nhear that--and you will show me how you did it in the empty house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made the affirmative sign once more.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the door in the passage below was opened and closed\r\nagain. Geoffrey instantly went down stairs. It was possible that Anne\r\nmight have forgotten something; and it was necessary to prevent her from\r\nreturning to her own room.\r\n\r\nThey met in the passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTired of waiting in the garden?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, abruptly.\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the dining-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe postman has just given me a letter for you, through the grating in\r\nthe gate,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI have put it on the table in there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went in. The handwriting on the address of the letter was the\r\nhandwriting of Mrs. Glenarm. He put it unread into his pocket, and went\r\nback to Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStep out!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall lose the train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey started for their visit to Holchester House.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIFTY-SEVENTH.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\nAT a few minutes before six o\xe2\x80\x99clock that evening, Lord Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncarriage brought Geoffrey and Anne back to the cottage.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey prevented the servant from ringing at the gate. He had taken\r\nthe key with him, when he left home earlier in the day. Having admitted\r\nAnne, and having closed the gate again, he went on before her to the\r\nkitchen window, and called to Hester Dethridge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake some cold water into the drawing-room and fill the vase on the\r\nchimney-piece,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sooner you put those flowers into water,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he added, turning to his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cthe longer they will last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pointed, as he spoke, to a nosegay in Anne\xe2\x80\x99s hand, which Julius had\r\ngathered for her from the conservatory at Holchester House. Leaving her\r\nto arrange the flowers in the vase, he went up stairs. After waiting for\r\na moment, he was joined by Hester Dethridge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, in a whisper.\r\n\r\nHester made the affirmative sign. Geoffrey took off his boots and led\r\nthe way into the spare room. They noiselessly moved the bed back to its\r\nplace against the partition wall--and left the room again. When Anne\r\nentered it, some minutes afterward, not the slightest change of any kind\r\nwas visible since she had last seen it in the middle of the day.\r\n\r\nShe removed her bonnet and mantle, and sat down to rest.\r\n\r\nThe whole course of events, since the previous night, had tended one\r\nway, and had exerted the same delusive influence over her mind. It was\r\nimpossible for her any longer to resist the conviction that she had\r\ndistrusted appearances without the slightest reason, and that she had\r\npermitted purely visionary suspicions to fill her with purely causeless\r\nalarm. In the firm belief that she was in danger, she had watched\r\nthrough the night--and nothing had happened. In the confident\r\nanticipation that Geoffrey had promised what he was resolved not to\r\nperform, she had waited to see what excuse he would find for keeping\r\nher at the cottage. And, when the time came for the visit, she found him\r\nready to fulfill the engagement which he had made. At Holchester House,\r\nnot the slightest interference had been attempted with her perfect\r\nliberty of action and speech. Resolved to inform Sir Patrick that she\r\nhad changed her room, she had described the alarm of fire and the events\r\nwhich had succeeded it, in the fullest detail--and had not been once\r\nchecked by Geoffrey from beginning to end. She had spoken in confidence\r\nto Blanche, and had never been interrupted. Walking round the\r\nconservatory, she had dropped behind the others with perfect impunity,\r\nto say a grateful word to Sir Patrick, and to ask if the interpretation\r\nthat he placed on Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was really the interpretation which\r\nhad been hinted at by Blanche. They had talked together for ten\r\nminutes or more. Sir Patrick had assured her that Blanche had correctly\r\nrepresented his opinion. He had declared his conviction that the rash\r\nway was, in her case, the right way; and that she would do well (with\r\nhis assistance) to take the initiative, in the matter of the separation,\r\non herself. \xe2\x80\x9cAs long as he can keep you under the same roof with\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x9d--Sir Patrick had said--\xe2\x80\x9cso long he will speculate on our anxiety to\r\nrelease you from the oppression of living with him; and so long he will\r\nhold out with his brother (in the character of a penitent husband)\r\nfor higher terms. Put the signal in the window, and try the experiment\r\nto-night. Once find your way to the garden door, and I answer for\r\nkeeping you safely out of his reach until he has submitted to the\r\nseparation, and has signed the deed.\xe2\x80\x9d In those words he had urged Anne\r\nto prompt action. He had received, in return, her promise to be guided\r\nby his advice. She had gone back to the drawing-room; and Geoffrey had\r\nmade no remark on her absence. She had returned to Fulham, alone with\r\nhim in his brother\xe2\x80\x99s carriage; and he had asked no questions. What was\r\nit natural, with her means of judging, to infer from all this? Could\r\nshe see into Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s mind and detect that he was deliberately\r\nconcealing his own conviction, in the fear that he might paralyze her\r\nenergies if he acknowledged the alarm for her that he really felt? No.\r\nShe could only accept the false appearances that surrounded her in the\r\ndisguise of truth. She could only adopt, in good faith, Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nassumed point of view, and believe, on the evidence of her own\r\nobservation, that Sir Patrick was right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToward dusk, Anne began to feel the exhaustion which was the necessary\r\nresult of a night passed without sleep. She rang her bell, and asked for\r\nsome tea.\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge answered the bell. Instead of making the usual sign,\r\nshe stood considering--and then wrote on her slate. These were the\r\nwords: \xe2\x80\x9cI have all the work to do, now the girl has gone. If you would\r\nhave your tea in the drawing-room, you would save me another journey up\r\nstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnne at once engaged to comply with the request.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ill?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked; noticing, faint as the light now was,\r\nsomething strangely altered in Hester\xe2\x80\x99s manner.\r\n\r\nWithout looking up, Hester shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas any thing happened to vex you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe negative sign was repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I offended you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe suddenly advanced a step, suddenly looked at Anne; checked herself\r\nwith a dull moan, like a moan of pain; and hurried out of the room.\r\n\r\nConcluding that she had inadvertently said, or done, something to offend\r\nHester Dethridge, Anne determined to return to the subject at the\r\nfirst favorable opportunity. In the mean time, she descended to the\r\nground-floor. The dining-room door, standing wide open, showed her\r\nGeoffrey sitting at the table, writing a letter--with the fatal\r\nbrandy-bottle at his side.\r\n\r\nAfter what Mr. Speedwell had told her, it was her duty to interfere. She\r\nperformed her duty, without an instant\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me for interrupting you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you have forgotten\r\nwhat Mr. Speedwell told you about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the bottle. Geoffrey looked at it; looked down again at\r\nhis letter; and impatiently shook his head. She made a second attempt at\r\nremonstrance--again without effect. He only said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right!\xe2\x80\x9d in lower\r\ntones than were customary with him, and continued his occupation. It was\r\nuseless to court a third repulse. Anne went into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nThe letter on which he was engaged was an answer to Mrs. Glenarm, who\r\nhad written to tell him that she was leaving town. He had reached his\r\ntwo concluding sentences when Anne spoke to him. They ran as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmay have news to bring you, before long, which you don\xe2\x80\x99t look for. Stay\r\nwhere you are through to-morrow, and wait to hear from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter sealing the envelope, he emptied his glass of brandy and water;\r\nand waited, looking through the open door. When Hester Dethridge crossed\r\nthe passage with the tea-tray, and entered the drawing-room, he gave the\r\nsign which had been agreed on. He rang his bell. Hester came out again,\r\nclosing the drawing-room door behind her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she safe at her tea?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, removing his heavy boots, and\r\nputting on the slippers which were placed ready for him.\r\n\r\nHester bowed her head.\r\n\r\nHe pointed up the stairs. \xe2\x80\x9cYou go first,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cNo nonsense!\r\nand no noise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ascended the stairs. He followed slowly. Although he had only drunk\r\none glass of brandy and water, his step was uncertain already. With one\r\nhand on the wall, and one hand on the banister, he made his way to the\r\ntop; stopped, and listened for a moment; then joined Hester in his own\r\nroom, and softly locked the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nShe was standing motionless in the middle of the room--not like a living\r\nwoman--like a machine waiting to be set in movement. Finding it useless\r\nto speak to her, he touched her (with a strange sensation of shrinking\r\nin him as he did it), and pointed to the partition wall.\r\n\r\nThe touch roused her. With slow step and vacant face--moving as if she\r\nwas walking in her sleep--she led the way to the papered wall; knelt\r\ndown at the skirting-board; and, taking out two small sharp nails,\r\nlifted up a long strip of the paper which had been detached from the\r\nplaster beneath. Mounting on a chair, she turned back the strip and\r\npinned it up, out of the way, using the two nails, which she had kept\r\nready in her hand.\r\n\r\nBy the last dim rays of twilight, Geoffrey looked at the wall.\r\n\r\nA hollow space met his view. At a distance of some three feet from the\r\nfloor, the laths had been sawn away, and the plaster had been ripped\r\nout, piecemeal, so as to leave a cavity, sufficient in height and width\r\nto allow free power of working in any direction, to a man\xe2\x80\x99s arms. The\r\ncavity completely pierced the substance of the wall. Nothing but the\r\npaper on the other side prevented eye or hand from penetrating into the\r\nnext room.\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge got down from the chair, and made signs for a light.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey took a match from the box. The same strange uncertainty which\r\nhad already possessed his feet, appeared now to possess his hands. He\r\nstruck the match too heavily against the sandpaper, and broke it. He\r\ntried another, and struck it too lightly to kindle the flame. Hester\r\ntook the box out of his hands. Having lit the candle, she hel d it low,\r\nand pointed to the skirting-board.\r\n\r\nTwo little hooks were fixed into the floor, near the part of the wall\r\nfrom which the paper had been removed. Two lengths of fine and strong\r\nstring were twisted once or twice round the hooks. The loose ends of the\r\nstring extending to some length beyond the twisted parts, were neatly\r\ncoiled away against the skirting-board. The other ends, drawn tight,\r\ndisappeared in two small holes drilled through the wall, at a height of\r\na foot from the floor.\r\n\r\nAfter first untwisting the strings from the hooks, Hester rose, and held\r\nthe candle so as to light the cavity in the wall. Two more pieces of the\r\nfine string were seen here, resting loose upon the uneven surface which\r\nmarked the lower boundary of the hollowed space. Lifting these higher\r\nstrings, Hester lifted the loosened paper in the next room--the lower\r\nstrings, which had previously held the strip firm and flat against the\r\nsound portion of the wall, working in their holes, and allowing the\r\npaper to move up freely. As it rose higher and higher, Geoffrey saw thin\r\nstrips of cotton wool lightly attached, at intervals, to the back of\r\nthe paper, so as effectually to prevent it from making a grating sound\r\nagainst the wall. Up and up it came slowly, till it could be pulled\r\nthrough the hollow space, and pinned up out of the way, as the strip\r\npreviously lifted had been pinned before it. Hester drew back, and made\r\nway for Geoffrey to look through. There was Anne\xe2\x80\x99s room, visible through\r\nthe wall! He softly parted the light curtains that hang over the bed.\r\nThere was the pillow, on which her head would rest at night, within\r\nreach of his hands!\r\n\r\nThe deadly dexterity of it struck him cold. His nerves gave way. He drew\r\nback with a start of guilty fear, and looked round the room. A pocket\r\nflask of brandy lay on the table at his bedside. He snatched it up, and\r\nemptied it at a draught--and felt like himself again.\r\n\r\nHe beckoned to Hester to approach him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore we go any further,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s one thing I want to know.\r\nHow is it all to be put right again? Suppose this room is examined?\r\nThose strings will show.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester opened a cupboard and produced a jar. She took out the cork.\r\nThere was a mixture inside which looked like glue. Partly by signs, and\r\npartly by help of the slate, she showed how the mixture could be applied\r\nto the back of the loosened strip of paper in the next room--how the\r\npaper could be glued to the sound lower part of the wall by tightening\r\nthe strings--how the strings, having served that purpose, could be\r\nsafely removed--how the same process could be followed in Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom, after the hollowed place had been filled up again with the\r\nmaterials waiting in the scullery, or even without filling up the\r\nhollowed place if the time failed for doing it. In either case, the\r\nrefastened paper would hide every thing, and the wall would tell no\r\ntales.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey was satisfied. He pointed next to the towels in his room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake one of them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand show me how you did it, with your own\r\nhands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he said the words, Anne\xe2\x80\x99s voice reached his ear from below, calling\r\nfor \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Dethridge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to say what might happen next. In another minute, she\r\nmight go up to her room, and discover every thing. Geoffrey pointed to\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut it right again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cInstantly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was soon done. All that was necessary was to let the two strips of\r\npaper drop back into their places--to fasten the strip to the wall in\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s room, by tightening the two lower strings--and then to replace\r\nthe nails which held the loose strip on Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s side. In a minute,\r\nthe wall had reassumed its customary aspect.\r\n\r\nThey stole out, and looked over the stairs into the passage below. After\r\ncalling uselessly for the second time, Anne appeared, crossed over to\r\nthe kitchen; and, returning again with the kettle in her hand, closed\r\nthe drawing-room door.\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge waited impenetrably to receive her next directions.\r\nThere were no further directions to give. The hideous dramatic\r\nrepresentation of the woman\xe2\x80\x99s crime for which Geoffrey had asked was\r\nin no respect necessary: the means were all prepared, and the manner\r\nof using them was self-evident. Nothing but the opportunity, and the\r\nresolution to profit by it, were wanting to lead the way to the end.\r\nGeoffrey signed to Hester to go down stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet back into the kitchen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore she comes out again. I\r\nshall keep in the garden. When she goes up into her room for the night,\r\nshow yourself at the back-door--and I shall know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester set her foot on the first stair--stopped--turned round--and\r\nlooked slowly along the two walls of the passage, from end to\r\nend--shuddered--shook her head--and went slowly on down the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you looking for?\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered after her.\r\n\r\nShe neither answered, nor looked back--she went her way into the\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\nHe waited a minute, and then followed her.\r\n\r\nOn his way out to the garden, he went into the dining-room. The moon had\r\nrisen; and the window-shutters were not closed. It was easy to find the\r\nbrandy and the jug of water on the table. He mixed the two, and emptied\r\nthe tumbler at a draught. \xe2\x80\x9cMy head\xe2\x80\x99s queer,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered to himself.\r\nHe passed his handkerchief over his face. \xe2\x80\x9cHow infernally hot it is\r\nto-night!\xe2\x80\x9d He made for the door. It was open, and plainly visible--and\r\nyet, he failed to find his way to it. Twice, he found himself trying to\r\nwalk through the wall, on either side. The third time, he got out, and\r\nreached the garden. A strange sensation possessed him, as he walked\r\nround and round. He had not drunk enough, or nearly enough, to\r\nintoxicate him. His mind, in a dull way, felt the same as usual; but his\r\nbody was like the body of a drunken man.\r\n\r\nThe night advanced; the clock of Putney Church struck ten.\r\n\r\nAnne appeared again from the drawing room, with her bedroom candle in\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut out the lights,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Hester, at the kitchen door; \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\ngoing up stairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe entered her room. The insupportable sense of weariness, after the\r\nsleepless night that she had passed, weighed more heavily on her than\r\never. She locked her door, but forbore, on this occasion, to fasten the\r\nbolts. The dread of danger was no longer present to her mind; and there\r\nwas this positive objection to losing the bolts, that the unfastening of\r\nthem would increase the difficulty of leaving the room noiselessly\r\nlater in the night. She loosened her dress, and lifted her hair from her\r\ntemples--and paced to and fro in the room wearily, thinking. Geoffrey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhabits were irregular; Hester seldom went to bed early.\r\n\r\nTwo hours at least--more probably three--must pass, before it would\r\nbe safe to communicate with Sir Patrick by means of the signal in the\r\nwindow. Her strength was fast failing her. If she persisted, for the\r\nnext three hours, in denying herself the repose which she sorely\r\nneeded, the chances were that her nerves might fail her, through sheer\r\nexhaustion, when the time came for facing the risk and making the effort\r\nto escape. Sleep was falling on her even now--and sleep she must have.\r\nShe had no fear of failing to wake at the needful time. Falling asleep,\r\nwith a special necessity for rising at a given hour present to her mind,\r\nAnne (like most other sensitively organized people) could trust herself\r\nto wake at that given hour, instinctively. She put her lighted candle\r\nin a safe position, and laid down on the bed. In less than five minutes,\r\nshe was in a deep sleep.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe church clock struck the quarter to eleven. Hester Dethridge showed\r\nherself at the back garden door. Geoffrey crossed the lawn, and joined\r\nher. The light of the lamp in the passage fell on his face. She started\r\nback from the sight of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head; and pointed through the dining-room door to the\r\nbrandy-bottle on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m as sober as you are, you fool!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever else it is, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester looked at him again. He was right. However unsteady his gait\r\nmight be, his speech was not the speech, his eyes were not the eyes, of\r\na drunken man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she in her room for the night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHester made the affirmative sign.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey ascended the st airs, swaying from side to side. He stopped at\r\nthe top, and beckoned to Hester to join him. He went on into his room;\r\nand, signing to her to follow him, closed the door.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the partition wall--without approaching it. Hester waited,\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she asleep?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\nHester went to the wall; listened at it; and made the affirmative reply.\r\n\r\nHe sat down. \xe2\x80\x9cMy head\xe2\x80\x99s queer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me a drink of water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He drank part of the water, and poured the rest over his head. Hester\r\nturned toward the door to leave him. He instantly stopped her. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t unwind the strings. _I_ can\xe2\x80\x99t lift up the paper. Do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe sternly made the sign of refusal: she resolutely opened the door to\r\nleave him. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want your Confession back?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. She closed the\r\ndoor, stolidly submissive in an instant; and crossed to the partition\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nShe lifted the loose strips of paper on either side of the wall--pointed\r\nthrough the hollowed place--and drew back again to the other end of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nHe rose and walked unsteadily from the chair to the foot of his bed.\r\nHolding by the wood-work of the bed; he waited a little. While he\r\nwaited, he became conscious of a change in the strange sensations that\r\npossessed him. A feeling as of a breath of cold air passed over the\r\nright side of his head. He became steady again: he could calculate his\r\ndistances: he could put his hands through the hollowed place, and draw\r\naside the light curtains, hanging from the hook in the ceiling over the\r\nhead of her bed. He could look at his sleeping wife.\r\n\r\nShe was dimly visible, by the light of the candle placed at the other\r\nend of her room. The worn and weary look had disappeared from her face.\r\nAll that had been purest and sweetest in it, in the by-gone time, seemed\r\nto be renewed by the deep sleep that held her gently. She was young\r\nagain in the dim light: she was beautiful in her calm repose. Her head\r\nlay back on the pillow. Her upturned face was in a position which\r\nplaced her completely at the mercy of the man under whose eyes she was\r\nsleeping--the man who was looking at her, with the merciless resolution\r\nin him to take her life.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting a while, he drew back. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s more like a child than a\r\nwoman to-night,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to himself under his breath. He glanced\r\nacross the room at Hester Dethridge. The lighted candle which she had\r\nbrought up stairs with her was burning near the place where she stood.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlow it out,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. She never moved. He repeated the direction.\r\nThere she stood, deaf to him.\r\n\r\nWhat was she doing? She was looking fixedly into one of the corners of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nHe turned his head again toward the hollowed place in the wall. He\r\nlooked at the peaceful face on the pillow once more. He deliberately\r\nrevived his own vindictive sense of the debt that he owed her. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have won the race: but for you,\r\nI should have been friends with my father: but for you, I might marry\r\nMrs. Glenarm.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned back again into the room while the sense of it\r\nwas at its fiercest in him. He looked round and round him. He took up a\r\ntowel; considered for a moment; and threw it down again.\r\n\r\nA new idea struck him. In two steps he was at the side of his bed. He\r\nseized on one of the pillows, and looked suddenly at Hester. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a\r\ndrunken brute, this time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to her. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a woman who will fight\r\nfor her life. The pillow\xe2\x80\x99s the safest of the two.\xe2\x80\x9d She never answered\r\nhim, and never looked toward him. He made once more for the place in\r\nthe wall; and stopped midway between it and his bed--stopped, and cast a\r\nbackward glance over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge was stirring at last.\r\n\r\nWith no third person in the room, she was looking, and moving,\r\nnevertheless, as if she was following a third person along the wall,\r\nfrom the corner. Her lips were parted in horror; her eyes, opening wider\r\nand wider, stared rigid and glittering at the empty wall. Step by step\r\nshe stole nearer and nearer to Geoffrey, still following some visionary\r\nThing, which was stealing nearer and nearer, too. He asked himself what\r\nit meant. Was the terror of the deed that he was about to do more than\r\nthe woman\xe2\x80\x99s brain could bear? Would she burst out screaming, and wake\r\nhis wife?\r\n\r\nHe hurried to the place in the wall--to seize the chance, while the\r\nchance was his.\r\n\r\nHe steadied his strong hold on the pillow.\r\n\r\nHe stooped to pass it through the opening.\r\n\r\nHe poised it over Anne\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping face.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment he felt Hester Dethridge\xe2\x80\x99s hand laid on him from\r\nbehind. The touch ran through him, from head to foot, like a touch of\r\nice. He drew back with a start, and faced her. Her eyes were staring\r\nstraight over his shoulder at something behind him--looking as they had\r\nlooked in the garden at Windygates.\r\n\r\nBefore he could speak he felt the flash of her eyes in _his_ eyes. For\r\nthe third time, she had seen the Apparition behind him. The homicidal\r\nfrenzy possessed her. She flew at his throat like a wild beast. The\r\nfeeble old woman attacked the athlete!\r\n\r\nHe dropped the pillow, and lifted his terrible right arm to brush her\r\nfrom him, as he might have brushed an insect from him.\r\n\r\nEven as he raised the arm a frightful distortion seized on his face. As\r\nif with an invisible hand, it dragged down the brow and the eyelid on\r\nthe right; it dragged down the mouth on the same side. His arm fell\r\nhelpless; his whole body, on the side under the arm, gave way. He\r\ndropped on the floor, like a man shot dead.\r\n\r\nHester Dethridge pounced on his prostrate body--knelt on his broad\r\nbreast--and fastened her ten fingers on his throat.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe shock of the fall woke Anne on the instant. She started up--looked\r\nround--and saw a gap in the wall at the head of her bed, and the\r\ncandle-light glimmering in the next room. Panic-stricken; doubting,\r\nfor the moment, if she were in her right mind, she drew back,\r\nwaiting--listening--looking. She saw nothing but the glimmering light\r\nin the room; she heard nothing but a hoarse gasping, as of some person\r\nlaboring for breath. The sound ceased. There was an interval of silence.\r\nThen the head of Hester Dethridge rose slowly into sight through the gap\r\nin the wall--rose with the glittering light of madness in the eyes, and\r\nlooked at her.\r\n\r\nShe flew to the open window, and screamed for help.\r\n\r\nSir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s voice answered her, from the road in front of the cottage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait for me, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\nShe fled from the room, and rushed down the stairs. In another moment,\r\nshe had opened the door, and was out in the front garden.\r\n\r\nAs she ran to the gate, she heard the voice of a strange man on the\r\nother side of it. Sir Patrick called to her encouragingly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe police\r\nman is with us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe patrols the garden at night--he has a\r\nkey.\xe2\x80\x9d As he spoke the gate was opened from the outside. She saw Sir\r\nPatrick, Arnold, and the policeman. She staggered toward them as they\r\ncame in--she was just able to say, \xe2\x80\x9cUp stairs!\xe2\x80\x9d before her senses failed\r\nher. Sir Patrick saved her from falling. He placed her on the bench in\r\nthe garden, and waited by her, while Arnold and the policeman hurried\r\ninto the cottage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere first?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Arnold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe room the lady called from,\xe2\x80\x9d said the policeman\r\n\r\nThey mounted the stairs, and entered Anne\xe2\x80\x99s room. The gap in the wall\r\nwas instantly observed by both of them. They looked through it.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey Delamayn\xe2\x80\x99s dead body lay on the floor. Hester Dethridge was\r\nkneeling at his head, praying.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MORNING CALL.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nTHE newspapers have announced the return of Lord and Lady Holchester\r\nto their residence in London, after an absence on the continent of more\r\nthan six months.\r\n\r\nIt is the height of the season. All day long, within the canonical\r\nhours, the door of Holchester House is perpetually opening to receive\r\nvisitors. The vast majority leave their cards, and go away again.\r\nCertain privileged individuals only, get out of their carriages, and\r\nenter the house.\r\n\r\nAmong these last, arriving at an earlier hour than is customary, is a\r\nperson of distinction who is positively bent on seeing either the master\r\nor the mistress of the house, and who will take no denial. While this\r\nperson is parleying with the chief of the servants, Lord Holchester,\r\npassing from one room to another, happens to cross the inner end of\r\nthe hall. The person instantly darts at him with a cry of \xe2\x80\x9cDear Lord\r\nHolchester!\xe2\x80\x9d Julius turns, and sees--Lady Lundie!\r\n\r\nHe is fairly caught, and he gives way with his best grace. As he opens\r\nthe door of the nearest room for her ladyship, he furtively consults his\r\nwatch, and says in his inmost soul, \xe2\x80\x9cHow am I to get rid of her before\r\nthe others come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie settles down on a sofa in a whirlwind of silk and lace, and\r\nbecomes, in her own majestic way, \xe2\x80\x9cperfectly charming.\xe2\x80\x9d She makes the\r\nmost affectionate inquiries about Lady Holchester, about the Dowager\r\nLady Holchester, about Julius himself. Where have they been? what have\r\nthey seen? have time and change helped them to recover the shock of that\r\ndreadful event, to which Lady Lundie dare not more particularly allude?\r\nJulius answers resignedly, and a little absently. He makes polite\r\ninquiries, on his side, as to her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s plans and proceedings--with\r\na mind uneasily conscious of the inexorable lapse of time, and of\r\ncertain probabilities which that lapse may bring with it. Lady Lundie\r\nhas very little to say about herself. She is only in town for a few\r\nweeks. Her life is a life of retirement. \xe2\x80\x9cMy modest round of duties\r\nat Windygates, Lord Holchester; occasionally relieved, when my mind\r\nis overworked, by the society of a few earnest friends whose views\r\nharmonize with my own--my existence passes (not quite uselessly, I hope)\r\nin that way. I have no news; I see nothing--except, indeed, yesterday, a\r\nsight of the saddest kind.\xe2\x80\x9d She pauses there. Julius observes that he is\r\nexpected to make inquiries, and makes them accordingly.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie hesitates; announces that her news refers to that painful\r\npast event which she has already touched on; acknowledges that she could\r\nnot find herself in London without feeling an act of duty involved in\r\nmaking inquiries at the asylum in which Hester Dethridge is confined for\r\nlife; announces that she has not only made the inquiries, but has seen\r\nthe unhappy woman herself; has spoken to her, has found her unconscious\r\nof her dreadful position, incapable of the smallest exertion of memory,\r\nresigned to the existence that she leads, and likely (in the opinion\r\nof the medical superintendent) to live for some years to come. Having\r\nstated these facts, her ladyship is about to make a few of those\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cremarks appropriate to the occasion,\xe2\x80\x9d in which she excels, when the\r\ndoor opens; and Lady Holchester, in search of her missing husband,\r\nenters the room.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThere is a new outburst of affectionate interest on Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart--met civilly, but not cordially, by Lady Holchester. Julius\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nseems, like Julius, to be uneasily conscious of the lapse of time. Like\r\nJulius again, she privately wonders how long Lady Lundie is going to\r\nstay.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie shows no signs of leaving the sofa. She has evidently come\r\nto Holchester House to say something--and she has not said it yet. Is\r\nshe going to say it? Yes. She is going to get, by a roundabout way, to\r\nthe object in view. She has another inquiry of the affectionate sort\r\nto make. May she be permitted to resume the subject of Lord and Lady\r\nHolchester\xe2\x80\x99s travels? They have been at Rome. Can they confirm the\r\nshocking intelligence which has reached her of the \xe2\x80\x9capostasy\xe2\x80\x9d of Mrs.\r\nGlenarm?\r\n\r\nLady Holchester can confirm it, by personal experience. Mrs. Glenarm\r\nhas renounced the world, and has taken refuge in the bosom of the Holy\r\nCatholic Church. Lady Holchester has seen her in a convent at Rome. She\r\nis passing through the period of her probation; and she is resolved to\r\ntake the veil. Lady Lundie, as a good Protestant, lifts her hands in\r\nhorror--declares the topic to be too painful to dwell on--and, by way of\r\nvarying it, goes straight to the point at last. Has Lady I Holchester,\r\nin the course of her continental experience, happened to meet with, or\r\nto hear of--Mrs. Arnold Brinkworth?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have ceased, as you know, to hold any communication with my\r\nrelatives,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Lundie explains. \xe2\x80\x9cThe course they took at the time of\r\nour family trial--the sympathy they felt with a Person whom I can not\r\neven now trust myself to name more particularly--alienated us from each\r\nother. I may be grieved, dear Lady Holchester; but I bear no malice. And\r\nI shall always feel a motherly interest in hearing of Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s welfare.\r\nI have been told that she and her husband were traveling, at the time\r\nwhen you and Lord Holchester were traveling. Did you meet with them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulius and his wife looked at each other. Lord Holchester is dumb. Lady\r\nHolchester replies:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe saw Mr. and Mrs. Arnold Brinkworth at Florence, and afterward\r\nat Naples, Lady Lundie. They returned to England a week since, in\r\nanticipation of a certain happy event, which will possibly increase the\r\nmembers of your family circle. They are now in London. Indeed, I may\r\ntell you that we expect them here to lunch to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving made this plain statement, Lady Holchester looks at Lady Lundie.\r\n(If _that_ doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hasten her departure, nothing will!)\r\n\r\nQuite useless! Lady Lundie holds her ground. Having heard absolutely\r\nnothing of her relatives for the last six months, she is burning with\r\ncuriosity to hear more. There is a name she has not mentioned yet. She\r\nplaces a certain constraint upon herself, and mentions it now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Sir Patrick?\xe2\x80\x9d says her ladyship, subsiding into a gentle\r\nmelancholy, suggestive of past injuries condoned by Christian\r\nforgiveness. \xe2\x80\x9cI only know what report tells me. Did you meet with Sir\r\nPatrick at Florence and Naples, also?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJulius and his wife look at each other again. The clock in the hall\r\nstrikes. Julius shudders. Lady Holchester\xe2\x80\x99s patience begins to give way.\r\nThere is an awkward pause. Somebody must say something. As before, Lady\r\nHolchester replies \xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick went abroad, Lady Lundie, with his niece\r\nand her husband; and Sir Patrick has come back with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn good health?\xe2\x80\x9d her ladyship inquires.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYounger than ever,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Holchester rejoins.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie smiles satirically. Lady Holchester notices the smile;\r\ndecides that mercy shown to _this_ woman is mercy misplaced; and\r\nannounces (to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s horror) that she has news to tell of Sir\r\nPatrick, which will probably take his sister-in-law by surprise.\r\n\r\nLady Lundie waits eagerly to hear what the news is.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no secret,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Holchester proceeds--\xe2\x80\x9cthough it is only known,\r\nas yet to a few intimate friends. Sir Patrick has made an important\r\nchange in his life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s charming smile suddenly dies out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick is not only a very clever and a very agreeable man,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady\r\nHolchester resumes a little maliciously; \xe2\x80\x9che is also, in all his habits\r\nand ways (as you well know), a man younger than his years--who still\r\npossesses many of the qualities which seldom fail to attract women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie starts to her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to tell me, Lady Holchester, that Sir Patrick is\r\nmarried?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer ladyship drops back on the sofa; helpless really and truly helpless,\r\nunder the double blow that has fallen on her. She is not only struck out\r\nof her place as the chief woman of the family, but (still on the right\r\nside of forty) she is socially superannuated, as The Dowager Lady\r\nLundie, for the rest of her life!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt his age!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaims, as soon as she can speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me for reminding you,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Holchester answers, \xe2\x80\x9cthat plenty of\r\nmen marry at Sir Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s age. In his case, it is only due to him to\r\nsay that his motive raises him beyond the reach of ridicule or reproach.\r\nHis marriage is a good action, in the highest sense of the word. It does\r\nhonor to _him,_ as well as to the lady who shares his position and his\r\nname.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA young girl, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d is Lady Lundie\xe2\x80\x99s next remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. A woman who has been tried by no common suffering, and who has\r\nborne her hard lot nobly. A woman who deserves the calmer and the\r\nhappier life on which she is entering now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask who she is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore the question can be answered, a knock at the house door announces\r\nthe arrival of visitors. For the third time, Julius and his wife look at\r\neach other. On this occasion, Julius interferes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife has already told you, Lady Lundie, that we expect Mr. and Mrs.\r\nBrinkworth to lunch. Sir Patrick, and the new Lady Lundie, accompany\r\nthem. If I am mistaken in supposing that it might not be quite agreeable\r\nto you to meet them, I can only ask your pardon. If I am right, I will\r\nleave Lady Holchester to receive our friends, and will do myself the\r\nhonor of taking you into another room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe advances to the door of an inner room. He offers his arm to Lady\r\nLundie. Her ladyship stands immovable; determined to see the woman who\r\nhas supplanted her. In a moment more, the door of entrance from the hall\r\nis thrown open; and the servant announces, \xe2\x80\x9cSir Patrick and Lady Lundie.\r\nMr. and Mrs. Arnold Brinkworth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Lundie looks at the woman who has taken her place at the head of\r\nthe family; and sees--ANNE SILVESTER!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Man and Wife, by Wilkie Collins\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MAN AND WIFE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1586-0.txt or 1586-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/5/8/1586/\r\n\r\nProduced by James Rusk and David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
