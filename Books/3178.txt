Squire Hawkins sat upon the pyramid of large blocks, called\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cstile,\xe2\x80\x9d in front of his house, contemplating the morning.\r\n\r\nThe locality was Obedstown, East Tennessee. You would not know that\r\nObedstown stood on the top of a mountain, for there was nothing about\r\nthe landscape to indicate it--but it did: a mountain that stretched\r\nabroad over whole counties, and rose very gradually. The district\r\nwas called the \xe2\x80\x9cKnobs of East Tennessee,\xe2\x80\x9d and had a reputation like\r\nNazareth, as far as turning out any good thing was concerned.\r\n\r\nThe Squire's house was a double log cabin, in a state of decay; two\r\nor three gaunt hounds lay asleep about the threshold, and lifted their\r\nheads sadly whenever Mrs. Hawkins or the children stepped in and out\r\nover their bodies. Rubbish was scattered about the grassless yard; a\r\nbench stood near the door with a tin wash basin on it and a pail of\r\nwater and a gourd; a cat had begun to drink from the pail, but the\r\nexertion was overtaxing her energies, and she had stopped to rest. There\r\nwas an ash-hopper by the fence, and an iron pot, for soft-soap-boiling,\r\nnear it.\r\n\r\nThis dwelling constituted one-fifteenth of Obedstown; the other fourteen\r\nhouses were scattered about among the tall pine trees and among the\r\ncorn-fields in such a way that a man might stand in the midst of the\r\ncity and not know but that he was in the country if he only depended on\r\nhis eyes for information.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSquire\xe2\x80\x9d Hawkins got his title from being postmaster of Obedstown--not\r\nthat the title properly belonged to the office, but because in those\r\nregions the chief citizens always must have titles of some sort, and so\r\nthe usual courtesy had been extended to Hawkins. The mail was monthly,\r\nand sometimes amounted to as much as three or four letters at a single\r\ndelivery. Even a rush like this did not fill up the postmaster's whole\r\nmonth, though, and therefore he \xe2\x80\x9ckept store\xe2\x80\x9d in the intervals.\r\n\r\nThe Squire was contemplating the morning. It was balmy and tranquil, the\r\nvagrant breezes were laden with the odor of flowers, the murmur of bees\r\nwas in the air, there was everywhere that suggestion of repose that\r\nsummer woodlands bring to the senses, and the vague, pleasurable\r\nmelancholy that such a time and such surroundings inspire.\r\n\r\nPresently the United States mail arrived, on horseback. There was but\r\none letter, and it was for the postmaster. The long-legged youth who\r\ncarried the mail tarried an hour to talk, for there was no hurry; and in\r\na little while the male population of the village had assembled to\r\nhelp. As a general thing, they were dressed in homespun \xe2\x80\x9cjeans,\xe2\x80\x9d blue or\r\nyellow--here were no other varieties of it; all wore one suspender and\r\nsometimes two--yarn ones knitted at home,--some wore vests, but few\r\nwore coats. Such coats and vests as did appear, however, were rather\r\npicturesque than otherwise, for they were made of tolerably fanciful\r\npatterns of calico--a fashion which prevails thereto this day among\r\nthose of the community who have tastes above the common level and are\r\nable to afford style. Every individual arrived with his hands in his\r\npockets; a hand came out occasionally for a purpose, but it always went\r\nback again after service; and if it was the head that was served, just\r\nthe cant that the dilapidated straw hat got by being uplifted and rooted\r\nunder, was retained until the next call altered the inclination; many\r\nhats were present, but none were erect and no two were canted just\r\nalike. We are speaking impartially of men, youths and boys. And we are\r\nalso speaking of these three estates when we say that every individual\r\nwas either chewing natural leaf tobacco prepared on his own premises, or\r\nsmoking the same in a corn-cob pipe. Few of the men wore whiskers; none\r\nwore moustaches; some had a thick jungle of hair under the chin and\r\nhiding the throat--the only pattern recognized there as being the\r\ncorrect thing in whiskers; but no part of any individual's face had seen\r\na razor for a week.\r\n\r\nThese neighbors stood a few moments looking at the mail carrier\r\nreflectively while he talked; but fatigue soon began to show itself,\r\nand one after another they climbed up and occupied the top rail of the\r\nfence, hump-shouldered and grave, like a company of buzzards assembled\r\nfor supper and listening for the death-rattle. Old Damrell said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTha hain't no news 'bout the jedge, hit ain't likely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCain't tell for sartin; some thinks he's gwyne to be 'long toreckly,\r\nand some thinks 'e hain't. Russ Mosely he tote ole Hanks he mought git\r\nto Obeds tomorrer or nex' day he reckoned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I wisht I knowed. I got a 'prime sow and pigs in the cote-house,\r\nand I hain't got no place for to put 'em. If the jedge is a gwyne to\r\nhold cote, I got to roust 'em out, I reckon. But tomorrer'll do, I\r\n'spect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe speaker bunched his thick lips together like the stem-end of a\r\ntomato and shot a bumble-bee dead that had lit on a weed seven feet\r\naway. One after another the several chewers expressed a charge of\r\ntobacco juice and delivered it at the deceased with steady, aim and\r\nfaultless accuracy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's a stirrin', down 'bout the Forks?\xe2\x80\x9d continued Old Damrell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I dunno, skasely. Ole Drake Higgins he's ben down to Shelby\r\nlas' week. Tuck his crap down; couldn't git shet o' the most uv it; hit\r\nwasn't no time for to sell, he say, so he 'fotch it back agin, 'lowin'\r\nto wait tell fall. Talks 'bout goin' to Mozouri--lots uv 'ems talkin'\r\nthat--away down thar, Ole Higgins say. Cain't make a livin' here no mo',\r\nsich times as these. Si Higgins he's ben over to Kaintuck n' married a\r\nhigh-toned gal thar, outen the fust families, an' he's come back to the\r\nForks with jist a hell's-mint o' whoop-jamboree notions, folks says.\r\nHe's tuck an' fixed up the ole house like they does in Kaintuck, he say,\r\nan' tha's ben folks come cler from Turpentine for to see it. He's tuck\r\nan gawmed it all over on the inside with plarsterin'.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's plasterin'?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dono. Hit's what he calls it. Ole Mam Higgins, she tole me. She say\r\nshe wasn't gwyne to hang out in no sich a dern hole like a hog. Says\r\nit's mud, or some sich kind o' nastiness that sticks on n' covers up\r\neverything. Plarsterin', Si calls it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis marvel was discussed at considerable length; and almost with\r\nanimation. But presently there was a dog-fight over in the neighborhood\r\nof the blacksmith shop, and the visitors slid off their perch like so\r\nmany turtles and strode to the battle-field with an interest bordering\r\non eagerness.\r\n\r\nThe Squire remained, and read his letter. Then he sighed, and sat long\r\nin meditation. At intervals he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMissouri. Missouri. Well, well, well, everything is so uncertain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt last he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I'll do it.--A man will just rot, here. My house my yard,\r\neverything around me, in fact, shows' that I am becoming one of these\r\ncattle--and I used to be thrifty in other times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was not more than thirty-five, but he had a worn look that made him\r\nseem older. He left the stile, entered that part of his house which was\r\nthe store, traded a quart of thick molasses for a coonskin and a cake of\r\nbeeswax, to an old dame in linsey-woolsey, put his letter away, and\r\nwent into the kitchen. His wife was there, constructing some dried apple\r\npies; a slovenly urchin of ten was dreaming over a rude weather-vane of\r\nhis own contriving; his small sister, close upon four years of age, was\r\nsopping corn-bread in some gravy left in the bottom of a frying-pan and\r\ntrying hard not to sop over a finger-mark that divided the pan through\r\nthe middle--for the other side belonged to the brother, whose musings\r\nmade him forget his stomach for the moment; a negro woman was busy\r\ncooking, at a vast fire-place. Shiftlessness and poverty reigned in the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNancy, I've made up my mind. The world is done with me, and perhaps\r\nI ought to be done with it. But no matter--I can wait. I am going to\r\nMissouri. I won't stay in this dead country and decay with it. I've had\r\nit on my mind sometime. I'm going to sell out here for whatever I can\r\nget, and buy a wagon and team and put you and the children in it and\r\nstart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnywhere that suits you, suits me, Si. And the children can't be any\r\nworse off in Missouri than, they are here, I reckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMotioning his wife to a private conference in their own room, Hawkins\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, they'll be better off. I've looked out for them, Nancy,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nhis face lighted. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you see these papers? Well, they are evidence\r\nthat I have taken up Seventy-five Thousand Acres of Land in this\r\ncounty--think what an enormous fortune it will be some day! Why, Nancy,\r\nenormous don't express it--the word's too tame! I tell your Nancy----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor goodness sake, Si----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, Nancy, wait--let me finish--I've been secretly bailing and fuming\r\nwith this grand inspiration for weeks, and I must talk or I'll burst! I\r\nhaven't whispered to a soul--not a word--have had my countenance under\r\nlock and key, for fear it might drop something that would tell even\r\nthese animals here how to discern the gold mine that's glaring under\r\ntheir noses. Now all that is necessary to hold this land and keep it\r\nin the family is to pay the trifling taxes on it yearly--five or ten\r\ndollars--the whole tract would not sell for over a third of a cent an\r\nacre now, but some day people will be glad to get it for twenty dollars,\r\nfifty dollars, a hundred dollars an acre! What should you say to\xe2\x80\x9d [here\r\nhe dropped his voice to a whisper and looked anxiously around to see\r\nthat there were no eavesdroppers,] \xe2\x80\x9ca thousand dollars an acre!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell you may open your eyes and stare! But it's so. You and I may not\r\nsee the day, but they'll see it. Mind I tell you; they'll see it. Nancy,\r\nyou've heard of steamboats, and maybe you believed in them--of course\r\nyou did. You've heard these cattle here scoff at them and call them lies\r\nand humbugs,--but they're not lies and humbugs, they're a reality and\r\nthey're going to be a more wonderful thing some day than they are now.\r\nThey're going to make a revolution in this world's affairs that will\r\nmake men dizzy to contemplate. I've been watching--I've been watching\r\nwhile some people slept, and I know what's coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven you and I will see the day that steamboats will come up that\r\nlittle Turkey river to within twenty miles of this land of ours--and\r\nin high water they'll come right to it! And this is not all, Nancy--it\r\nisn't even half! There's a bigger wonder--the railroad! These worms here\r\nhave never even heard of it--and when they do they'll not believe in it.\r\nBut it's another fact. Coaches that fly over the ground twenty miles an\r\nhour--heavens and earth, think of that, Nancy! Twenty miles an hour. It\r\nmakes a man's brain whirl. Some day, when you and I are in our graves,\r\nthere'll be a railroad stretching hundreds of miles--all the way down\r\nfrom the cities of the Northern States to New Orleans--and its got to\r\nrun within thirty miles of this land--may be even touch a corner of\r\nit. Well, do you know, they've quit burning wood in some places in the\r\nEastern States? And what do you suppose they burn? Coal!\xe2\x80\x9d [He bent over\r\nand whispered again:] \xe2\x80\x9cThere's world--worlds of it on this land! You\r\nknow that black stuff that crops out of the bank of the branch?--well,\r\nthat's it. You've taken it for rocks; so has every body here; and\r\nthey've built little dams and such things with it. One man was going to\r\nbuild a chimney out of it. Nancy I expect I turned as white as a sheet!\r\nWhy, it might have caught fire and told everything. I showed him it\r\nwas too crumbly. Then he was going to build it of copper ore--splendid\r\nyellow forty-per-cent. ore! There's fortunes upon fortunes of copper\r\nore on our land! It scared me to death, the idea of this fool starting\r\na smelting furnace in his house without knowing it, and getting his\r\ndull eyes opened. And then he was going to build it of iron ore! There's\r\nmountains of iron ore here, Nancy--whole mountains of it. I wouldn't\r\ntake any chances. I just stuck by him--I haunted him--I never let\r\nhim alone till he built it of mud and sticks like all the rest of the\r\nchimneys in this dismal country. Pine forests, wheat land, corn land,\r\niron, copper, coal--wait till the railroads come, and the steamboats!\r\nWe'll never see the day, Nancy--never in the world--never, never, never,\r\nchild. We've got to drag along, drag along, and eat crusts in toil and\r\npoverty, all hopeless and forlorn--but they'll ride in coaches, Nancy!\r\nThey'll live like the princes of the earth; they'll be courted\r\nand worshiped; their names will be known from ocean to ocean! Ah,\r\nwell-a-day! Will they ever come back here, on the railroad and the\r\nsteamboat, and say, 'This one little spot shall not be touched--this\r\nhovel shall be sacred--for here our father and our mother suffered for\r\nus, thought for us, laid the foundations of our future as solid as the\r\nhills!'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a great, good, noble soul, Si Hawkins, and I am an honored\r\nwoman to be the wife of such a man\xe2\x80\x9d--and the tears stood in her eyes\r\nwhen she said it. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will go to Missouri. You are out of your place,\r\nhere, among these groping dumb creatures. We will find a higher place,\r\nwhere you can walk with your own kind, and be understood when you\r\nspeak--not stared at as if you were talking some foreign tongue. I would\r\ngo anywhere, anywhere in the wide world with you. I would rather my body\r\nwould starve and die than your mind should hunger and wither away in\r\nthis lonely land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpoken like yourself, my child! But we'll not starve, Nancy. Far from\r\nit. I have a letter from Beriah Sellers--just came this day. A letter\r\nthat--I'll read you a line from it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe flew out of the room. A shadow blurred the sunlight in Nancy's\r\nface--there was uneasiness in it, and disappointment. A procession of\r\ndisturbing thoughts began to troop through her mind. Saying nothing\r\naloud, she sat with her hands in her lap; now and then she clasped\r\nthem, then unclasped them, then tapped the ends of the fingers together;\r\nsighed, nodded, smiled--occasionally paused, shook her head. This\r\npantomime was the elocutionary expression of an unspoken soliloquy which\r\nhad something of this shape:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid of it--was afraid of it. Trying to make our fortune\r\nin Virginia, Beriah Sellers nearly ruined us and we had to settle in\r\nKentucky and start over again. Trying to make our fortune in Kentucky\r\nhe crippled us again and we had to move here. Trying to make our fortune\r\nhere, he brought us clear down to the ground, nearly. He's an honest\r\nsoul, and means the very best in the world, but I'm afraid, I'm afraid\r\nhe's too flighty. He has splendid ideas, and he'll divide his chances\r\nwith his friends with a free hand, the good generous soul, but something\r\ndoes seem to always interfere and spoil everything. I never did think\r\nhe was right well balanced. But I don't blame my husband, for I do think\r\nthat when that man gets his head full of a new notion, he can out-talk a\r\nmachine. He'll make anybody believe in that notion that'll listen to him\r\nten minutes--why I do believe he would make a deaf and dumb man believe\r\nin it and get beside himself, if you only set him where he could see his\r\neyes tally and watch his hands explain. What a head he has got! When he\r\ngot up that idea there in Virginia of buying up whole loads of negroes\r\nin Delaware and Virginia and Tennessee, very quiet, having papers drawn\r\nto have them delivered at a place in Alabama and take them and pay for\r\nthem, away yonder at a certain time, and then in the meantime get a\r\nlaw made stopping everybody from selling negroes to the south after a\r\ncertain day--it was somehow that way--mercy how the man would have made\r\nmoney! Negroes would have gone up to four prices. But after he'd spent\r\nmoney and worked hard, and traveled hard, and had heaps of negroes all\r\ncontracted for, and everything going along just right, he couldn't get\r\nthe laws passed and down the whole thing tumbled. And there in Kentucky,\r\nwhen he raked up that old numskull that had been inventing away at a\r\nperpetual motion machine for twenty-two years, and Beriah Sellers saw at\r\na glance where just one more little cog-wheel would settle the business,\r\nwhy I could see it as plain as day when he came in wild at midnight and\r\nhammered us out of bed and told the whole thing in a whisper with the\r\ndoors bolted and the candle in an empty barrel.\r\n\r\nOceans of money in it--anybody could see that. But it did cost a deal\r\nto buy the old numskull out--and then when they put the new cog wheel\r\nin they'd overlooked something somewhere and it wasn't any use--the\r\ntroublesome thing wouldn't go. That notion he got up here did look as\r\nhandy as anything in the world; and how him and Si did sit up nights\r\nworking at it with the curtains down and me watching to see if any\r\nneighbors were about. The man did honestly believe there was a fortune\r\nin that black gummy oil that stews out of the bank Si says is coal; and\r\nhe refined it himself till it was like water, nearly, and it did burn,\r\nthere's no two ways about that; and I reckon he'd have been all right in\r\nCincinnati with his lamp that he got made, that time he got a house full\r\nof rich speculators to see him exhibit only in the middle of his speech\r\nit let go and almost blew the heads off the whole crowd.\r\n\r\nI haven't got over grieving for the money that cost yet. I am sorry\r\nenough Beriah Sellers is in Missouri, now, but I was glad when he went.\r\nI wonder what his letter says. But of course it's cheerful; he's never\r\ndown-hearted--never had any trouble in his life--didn't know it if\r\nhe had. It's always sunrise with that man, and fine and blazing, at\r\nthat--never gets noon, though--leaves off and rises again. Nobody can\r\nhelp liking the creature, he means so well--but I do dread to come\r\nacross him again; he's bound to set us all crazy, of course. Well, there\r\ngoes old widow Hopkins--it always takes her a week to buy a spool of\r\nthread and trade a hank of yarn. Maybe Si can come with the letter,\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he did:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWidow Hopkins kept me--I haven't any patience with such tedious people.\r\nNow listen, Nancy--just listen at this:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Come right along to Missouri! Don't wait and worry about a good price\r\nbut sell out for whatever you can get, and come along, or you might be\r\ntoo late. Throw away your traps, if necessary, and come empty-handed.\r\nYou'll never regret it. It's the grandest country--the loveliest\r\nland--the purest atmosphere--I can't describe it; no pen can do it\r\njustice. And it's filling up, every day--people coming from everywhere.\r\nI've got the biggest scheme on earth--and I'll take you in; I'll take\r\nin every friend I've got that's ever stood by me, for there's enough\r\nfor all, and to spare. Mum's the word--don't whisper--keep yourself to\r\nyourself. You'll see! Come! --rush!--hurry!--don't wait for anything!'\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's the same old boy, Nancy, jest the same old boy--ain't he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think there's a little of the old sound about his voice yet. I\r\nsuppose you--you'll still go, Si?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo! Well, I should think so, Nancy. It's all a chance, of course, and,\r\nchances haven't been kind to us, I'll admit--but whatever comes, old\r\nwife, they're provided for. Thank God for that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen,\xe2\x80\x9d came low and earnestly.\r\n\r\nAnd with an activity and a suddenness that bewildered Obedstown and\r\nalmost took its breath away, the Hawkinses hurried through with their\r\narrangements in four short months and flitted out into the great\r\nmysterious blank that lay beyond the Knobs of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the third day's journey the wayfarers were just\r\nbeginning to think of camping, when they came upon a log cabin in the\r\nwoods. Hawkins drew rein and entered the yard. A boy about ten years old\r\nwas sitting in the cabin door with his face bowed in his hands. Hawkins\r\napproached, expecting his footfall to attract attention, but it did not.\r\nHe halted a moment, and then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, little chap, you mustn't be going to sleep before sundown\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a tired expression the small face came up out of the hands,--a face\r\ndown which tears were flowing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I'm sorry I spoke so, my boy. Tell me--is anything the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy signified with a scarcely perceptible gesture that the trouble\r\nwas in the house, and made room for Hawkins to pass. Then he put his\r\nface in his hands again and rocked himself about as one suffering a\r\ngrief that is too deep to find help in moan or groan or outcry.\r\nHawkins stepped within. It was a poverty stricken place. Six or eight\r\nmiddle-aged country people of both sexes were grouped about an object\r\nin the middle of the room; they were noiselessly busy and they talked\r\nin whispers when they spoke. Hawkins uncovered and approached. A coffin\r\nstood upon two backless chairs. These neighbors had just finished\r\ndisposing the body of a woman in it--a woman with a careworn, gentle\r\nface that had more the look of sleep about it than of death. An old lady\r\nmotioned, toward the door and said to Hawkins in a whisper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis mother, po' thing. Died of the fever, last night. Tha warn't no\r\nsich thing as saving of her. But it's better for her--better for her.\r\nHusband and the other two children died in the spring, and she hain't\r\never hilt up her head sence. She jest went around broken-hearted like,\r\nand never took no intrust in anything but Clay--that's the boy thar.\r\nShe jest worshiped Clay--and Clay he worshiped her. They didn't 'pear to\r\nlive at all, only when they was together, looking at each other, loving\r\none another. She's ben sick three weeks; and if you believe me that\r\nchild has worked, and kep' the run of the med'cin, and the times of\r\ngiving it, and sot up nights and nussed her, and tried to keep up her\r\nsperits, the same as a grown-up person. And last night when she kep'\r\na sinking and sinking, and turned away her head and didn't know him no\r\nmo', it was fitten to make a body's heart break to see him climb onto\r\nthe bed and lay his cheek agin hern and call her so pitiful and she not\r\nanswer. But bymeby she roused up, like, and looked around wild, and then\r\nshe see him, and she made a great cry and snatched him to her breast and\r\nhilt him close and kissed him over and over agin; but it took the last\r\npo' strength she had, and so her eyelids begin to close down, and her\r\narms sort o' drooped away and then we see she was gone, po' creetur. And\r\nClay, he--Oh, the po' motherless thing--I cain't talk about it--I cain't\r\nbear to talk about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClay had disappeared from the door; but he came in, now, and the\r\nneighbors reverently fell apart and made way for him. He leaned upon the\r\nopen coffin and let his tears course silently. Then he put out his small\r\nhand and smoothed the hair and stroked the dead face lovingly. After a\r\nbit he brought his other hand up from behind him and laid three or\r\nfour fresh wild flowers upon the breast, bent over and kissed the\r\nunresponsive lips time and time again, and then turned away and went out\r\nof the house without looking at any of the company. The old lady said to\r\nHawkins:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe always loved that kind o' flowers. He fetched 'em for her every\r\nmorning, and she always kissed him. They was from away north somers--she\r\nkep' school when she fust come. Goodness knows what's to become o' that\r\npo' boy. No father, no mother, no kin folks of no kind. Nobody to go\r\nto, nobody that k'yers for him--and all of us is so put to it for to get\r\nalong and families so large.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawkins understood. All eyes were turned inquiringly upon him. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriends, I am not very well provided for, myself, but still I would not\r\nturn my back on a homeless orphan. If he will go with me I will give him\r\na home, and loving regard--I will do for him as I would have another do\r\nfor a child of my own in misfortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne after another the people stepped forward and wrung the stranger's\r\nhand with cordial good will, and their eyes looked all that their hands\r\ncould not express or their lips speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaid like a true man,\xe2\x80\x9d said one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou was a stranger to me a minute ago, but you ain't now,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's bread cast upon the waters--it'll return after many days,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe old lady whom we have heard speak before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou got to camp in my house as long as you hang out here,\xe2\x80\x9d said one.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf tha hain't room for you and yourn my tribe'll turn out and camp in\r\nthe hay loft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few minutes afterward, while the preparations for the funeral were\r\nbeing concluded, Mr. Hawkins arrived at his wagon leading his little\r\nwaif by the hand, and told his wife all that had happened, and asked her\r\nif he had done right in giving to her and to himself this new care? She\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you've done wrong, Si Hawkins, it's a wrong that will shine brighter\r\nat the judgment day than the rights that many a man has done before you.\r\nAnd there isn't any compliment you can pay me equal to doing a thing\r\nlike this and finishing it up, just taking it for granted that I'll be\r\nwilling to it. Willing? Come to me; you poor motherless boy, and let me\r\ntake your grief and help you carry it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the child awoke in the morning, it was as if from a troubled dream.\r\nBut slowly the confusion in his mind took form, and he remembered his\r\ngreat loss; the beloved form in the coffin; his talk with a generous\r\nstranger who offered him a home; the funeral, where the stranger's wife\r\nheld him by the hand at the grave, and cried with him and comforted\r\nhim; and he remembered how this, new mother tucked him in his bed in the\r\nneighboring farm house, and coaxed him to talk about his troubles, and\r\nthen heard him say his prayers and kissed him good night, and left him\r\nwith the soreness in his heart almost healed and his bruised spirit at\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nAnd now the new mother came again, and helped him to dress, and combed\r\nhis hair, and drew his mind away by degrees from the dismal yesterday,\r\nby telling him about the wonderful journey he was going to take and the\r\nstrange things he was going to see. And after breakfast they two went\r\nalone to the grave, and his heart went out to his new friend and his\r\nuntaught eloquence poured the praises of his buried idol into her ears\r\nwithout let or hindrance. Together they planted roses by the headboard\r\nand strewed wild flowers upon the grave; and then together they went\r\naway, hand in hand, and left the dead to the long sleep that heals all\r\nheart-aches and ends all sorrows.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWhatever the lagging dragging journey may have been to the rest of\r\nthe emigrants, it was a wonder and delight to the children, a world\r\nof enchantment; and they believed it to be peopled with the mysterious\r\ndwarfs and giants and goblins that figured in the tales the negro slaves\r\nwere in the habit of telling them nightly by the shuddering light of the\r\nkitchen fire.\r\n\r\nAt the end of nearly a week of travel, the party went into camp near\r\na shabby village which was caving, house by house, into the hungry\r\nMississippi. The river astonished the children beyond measure. Its\r\nmile-breadth of water seemed an ocean to them, in the shadowy twilight,\r\nand the vague riband of trees on the further shore, the verge of a\r\ncontinent which surely none but they had ever seen before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle Dan'l\xe2\x80\x9d (colored,) aged 40; his wife, \xe2\x80\x9caunt Jinny,\xe2\x80\x9d aged 30,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung Miss\xe2\x80\x9d Emily Hawkins, \xe2\x80\x9cYoung Mars\xe2\x80\x9d Washington Hawkins and \xe2\x80\x9cYoung\r\nMars\xe2\x80\x9d Clay, the new member of the family, ranged themselves on a log,\r\nafter supper, and contemplated the marvelous river and discussed it. The\r\nmoon rose and sailed aloft through a maze of shredded cloud-wreaths; the\r\nsombre river just perceptibly brightened under the veiled light; a deep\r\nsilence pervaded the air and was emphasized, at intervals, rather than\r\nbroken, by the hooting of an owl, the baying of a dog, or the muffled\r\ncrash of a carving bank in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe little company assembled on the log were all children (at least in\r\nsimplicity and broad and comprehensive ignorance,) and the remarks they\r\nmade about the river were in keeping with the character; and so awed\r\nwere they by the grandeur and the solemnity of the scene before them,\r\nand by their belief that the air was filled with invisible spirits and\r\nthat the faint zephyrs were caused by their passing wings, that all\r\ntheir talk took to itself a tinge of the supernatural, and their voices\r\nwere subdued to a low and reverent tone. Suddenly Uncle Dan'l exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChil'en, dah's sum fin a comin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll crowded close together and every heart beat faster.\r\n\r\nUncle Dan'l pointed down the river with his bony finger.\r\n\r\nA deep coughing sound troubled the stillness, way toward a wooded cape\r\nthat jetted into the stream a mile distant. All in an instant a fierce\r\neye of fire shot out from behind the cape and sent a long brilliant\r\npathway quivering athwart the dusky water. The coughing grew louder and\r\nlouder, the glaring eye grew larger and still larger, glared wilder and\r\nstill wilder. A huge shape developed itself out of the gloom, and from\r\nits tall duplicate horns dense volumes of smoke, starred and spangled\r\nwith sparks, poured out and went tumbling away into the farther\r\ndarkness. Nearer and nearer the thing came, till its long sides began\r\nto glow with spots of light which mirrored themselves in the river and\r\nattended the monster like a torchlight procession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it! Oh, what is it, Uncle Dan'l!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith deep solemnity the answer came:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's de Almighty! Git down on yo' knees!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not necessary to say it twice. They were all kneeling, in\r\na moment. And then while the mysterious coughing rose stronger and\r\nstronger and the threatening glare reached farther and wider, the\r\nnegro's voice lifted up its supplications:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord', we's ben mighty wicked, an' we knows dat we 'zerve to go to\r\nde bad place, but good Lord, deah Lord, we ain't ready yit, we ain't\r\nready--let dese po' chilen hab one mo' chance, jes' one mo' chance. Take\r\nde ole niggah if you's got to hab somebody.--Good Lord, good deah Lord,\r\nwe don't know whah you's a gwyne to, we don't know who you's got yo' eye\r\non, but we knows by de way you's a comin', we knows by de way you's a\r\ntiltin' along in yo' charyot o' fiah dat some po' sinner's a gwyne\r\nto ketch it. But good Lord, dose chilen don't b'long heah, dey's f'm\r\nObedstown whah dey don't know nuffin, an' you knows, yo' own sef, dat\r\ndey ain't 'sponsible. An' deah Lord, good Lord, it ain't like yo' mercy,\r\nit ain't like yo' pity, it ain't like yo' long-sufferin' lovin' kindness\r\nfor to take dis kind o' 'vantage o' sick little chil'en as dose is when\r\ndey's so many ornery grown folks chuck full o' cussedness dat wants\r\nroastin' down dah. Oh, Lord, spah de little chil'en, don't tar de little\r\nchil'en away f'm dey frens, jes' let 'em off jes' dis once, and take it\r\nout'n de ole niggah. HEAH I IS, LORD, HEAH I IS! De ole niggah's ready,\r\nLord, de ole----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe flaming and churning steamer was right abreast the party, and not\r\ntwenty steps away. The awful thunder of a mud-valve suddenly burst\r\nforth, drowning the prayer, and as suddenly Uncle Dan'l snatched a child\r\nunder each arm and scoured into the woods with the rest of the pack at\r\nhis heels. And then, ashamed of himself, he halted in the deep darkness\r\nand shouted, (but rather feebly:)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeah I is, Lord, heah I is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of throbbing suspense, and then, to the surprise and\r\nthe comfort of the party, it was plain that the august presence had gone\r\nby, for its dreadful noises were receding. Uncle Dan'l headed a cautious\r\nreconnaissance in the direction of the log. Sure enough \xe2\x80\x9cthe Lord\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n was just turning a point a short distance up the river, and while they\r\nlooked the lights winked out and the coughing diminished by degrees and\r\npresently ceased altogether.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH'wsh! Well now dey's some folks says dey ain't no 'ficiency in prah.\r\nDis Chile would like to know whah we'd a ben now if it warn't fo' dat\r\nprah? Dat's it. Dat's it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle Dan'l, do you reckon it was the prayer that saved us?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes I reckon? Don't I know it! Whah was yo' eyes? Warn't de Lord jes'\r\na cumin' chow! chow! CHOW! an' a goin' on turrible--an' do de Lord carry\r\non dat way 'dout dey's sumfin don't suit him? An' warn't he a lookin'\r\nright at dis gang heah, an' warn't he jes' a reachin' for 'em? An'\r\nd'you spec' he gwyne to let 'em off 'dout somebody ast him to do it? No\r\nindeedy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you reckon he saw, us, Uncle Dan'l?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe law sakes, Chile, didn't I see him a lookin' at us?\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you feel scared, Uncle Dan'l?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo sah! When a man is 'gaged in prah, he ain't fraid o' nuffin--dey\r\ncan't nuffin tetch him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell what did you run for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I--I--mars Clay, when a man is under de influence ob de sperit,\r\nhe do-no, what he's 'bout--no sah; dat man do-no what he's 'bout. You\r\nmout take an' tah de head off'n dat man an' he wouldn't scasely fine\r\nit out. Date's de Hebrew chil'en dat went frough de fiah; dey was burnt\r\nconsidable--ob coase dey was; but dey didn't know nuffin 'bout it--heal\r\nright up agin; if dey'd ben gals dey'd missed dey long haah, (hair,)\r\nmaybe, but dey wouldn't felt de burn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know but what they were girls. I think they were.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow mars Clay, you knows bettern dat. Sometimes a body can't tell\r\nwhedder you's a sayin' what you means or whedder you's a sayin' what you\r\ndon't mean, 'case you says 'em bofe de same way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how should I know whether they were boys or girls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness sakes, mars Clay, don't de Good Book say? 'Sides, don't it\r\ncall 'em de HE-brew chil'en? If dey was gals wouldn't dey be de SHE-brew\r\nchil'en? Some people dat kin read don't 'pear to take no notice when dey\r\ndo read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Uncle Dan'l, I think that-----My! here comes another one up the\r\nriver! There can't be two!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe gone dis time--we done gone dis time, sho'! Dey ain't two, mars\r\nClay--days de same one. De Lord kin 'pear eberywhah in a second.\r\nGoodness, how do fiah and de smoke do belch up! Dat mean business,\r\nhoney. He comin' now like he fo'got sumfin. Come 'long, chil'en, time\r\nyou's gwyne to roos'. Go 'long wid you--ole Uncle Daniel gwyne out in de\r\nwoods to rastle in prah--de ole nigger gwyne to do what he kin to sabe\r\nyou agin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did go to the woods and pray; but he went so far that he doubted,\r\nhimself, if the Lord heard him when He went by.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n--Seventhly, Before his Voyage, He should make his peace with God,\r\nsatisfie his Creditors if he be in debt; Pray earnestly to God to\r\nprosper him in his Voyage, and to keep him from danger, and, if he\r\nbe 'sui juris' he should make his last will, and wisely order all his\r\naffairs, since many that go far abroad, return not home. (This good and\r\nChristian Counsel is given by Martinus Zeilerus in his Apodemical Canons\r\nbefore his Itinerary of Spain and Portugal.) Early in the morning Squire\r\nHawkins took passage in a small steamboat, with his family and his two\r\nslaves, and presently the bell rang, the stage-plank was hauled in, and\r\nthe vessel proceeded up the river. The children and the slaves were not\r\nmuch more at ease after finding out that this monster was a creature of\r\nhuman contrivance than they were the night before when they thought it\r\nthe Lord of heaven and earth. They started, in fright, every time the\r\ngauge-cocks sent out an angry hiss, and they quaked from head to foot\r\nwhen the mud-valves thundered. The shivering of the boat under the\r\nbeating of the wheels was sheer misery to them.\r\n\r\nBut of course familiarity with these things soon took away their\r\nterrors, and then the voyage at once became a glorious adventure, a\r\nroyal progress through the very heart and home of romance, a realization\r\nof their rosiest wonder-dreams. They sat by the hour in the shade of\r\nthe pilot house on the hurricane deck and looked out over the curving\r\nexpanses of the river sparkling in the sunlight. Sometimes the boat\r\nfought the mid-stream current, with a verdant world on either hand, and\r\nremote from both; sometimes she closed in under a point, where the dead\r\nwater and the helping eddies were, and shaved the bank so closely that\r\nthe decks were swept by the jungle of over-hanging willows and littered\r\nwith a spoil of leaves; departing from these \xe2\x80\x9cpoints\xe2\x80\x9d she regularly\r\ncrossed the river every five miles, avoiding the \xe2\x80\x9cbight\xe2\x80\x9d of the great\r\nbinds and thus escaping the strong current; sometimes she went out\r\nand skirted a high \xe2\x80\x9cbluff\xe2\x80\x9d sand-bar in the middle of the stream, and\r\noccasionally followed it up a little too far and touched upon the shoal\r\nwater at its head--and then the intelligent craft refused to run herself\r\naground, but \xe2\x80\x9csmelt\xe2\x80\x9d the bar, and straightway the foamy streak that\r\nstreamed away from her bows vanished, a great foamless wave rolled\r\nforward and passed her under way, and in this instant she leaned far\r\nover on her side, shied from the bar and fled square away from the\r\ndanger like a frightened thing--and the pilot was lucky if he managed\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9cstraighten her up\xe2\x80\x9d before she drove her nose into the opposite bank;\r\nsometimes she approached a solid wall of tall trees as if she meant to\r\nbreak through it, but all of a sudden a little crack would open just\r\nenough to admit her, and away she would go plowing through the \xe2\x80\x9cchute\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n with just barely room enough between the island on one side and the\r\nmain land on the other; in this sluggish water she seemed to go like a\r\nracehorse; now and then small log cabins appeared in little clearings,\r\nwith the never-failing frowsy women and girls in soiled and faded\r\nlinsey-woolsey leaning in the doors or against woodpiles and rail\r\nfences, gazing sleepily at the passing show; sometimes she found shoal\r\nwater, going out at the head of those \xe2\x80\x9cchutes\xe2\x80\x9d or crossing the river,\r\nand then a deck-hand stood on the bow and hove the lead, while the boat\r\nslowed down and moved cautiously; sometimes she stopped a moment at a\r\nlanding and took on some freight or a passenger while a crowd of slouchy\r\nwhite men and negroes stood on the bank and looked sleepily on with\r\ntheir hands in their pantaloons pockets,--of course--for they never took\r\nthem out except to stretch, and when they did this they squirmed about\r\nand reached their fists up into the air and lifted themselves on tip-toe\r\nin an ecstasy of enjoyment.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun went down it turned all the broad river to a national\r\nbanner laid in gleaming bars of gold and purple and crimson; and in time\r\nthese glories faded out in the twilight and left the fairy archipelagoes\r\nreflecting their fringing foliage in the steely mirror of the stream.\r\n\r\nAt night the boat forged on through the deep solitudes of the river,\r\nhardly ever discovering a light to testify to a human presence--mile\r\nafter mile and league after league the vast bends were guarded by\r\nunbroken walls of forest that had never been disturbed by the voice or\r\nthe foot-fall of man or felt the edge of his sacrilegious axe.\r\n\r\nAn hour after supper the moon came up, and Clay and Washington ascended\r\nto the hurricane deck to revel again in their new realm of enchantment.\r\nThey ran races up and down the deck; climbed about the bell; made\r\nfriends with the passenger-dogs chained under the lifeboat; tried to\r\nmake friends with a passenger-bear fastened to the verge-staff but were\r\nnot encouraged;\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cskinned the cat\xe2\x80\x9d on the hog-chains; in a word, exhausted the\r\namusement-possibilities of the deck. Then they looked wistfully up at\r\nthe pilot house, and finally, little by little, Clay ventured up there,\r\nfollowed diffidently by Washington. The pilot turned presently to \xe2\x80\x9cget\r\nhis stern-marks,\xe2\x80\x9d saw the lads and invited them in. Now their happiness\r\nwas complete. This cosy little house, built entirely of glass and\r\ncommanding a marvelous prospect in every direction was a magician's\r\nthrone to them and their enjoyment of the place was simply boundless.\r\n\r\nThey sat them down on a high bench and looked miles ahead and saw the\r\nwooded capes fold back and reveal the bends beyond; and they looked\r\nmiles to the rear and saw the silvery highway diminish its breadth by\r\ndegrees and close itself together in the distance. Presently the pilot\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy George, yonder comes the Amaranth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA spark appeared, close to the water, several miles down the river. The\r\npilot took his glass and looked at it steadily for a moment, and said,\r\nchiefly to himself:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can't be the Blue Wing. She couldn't pick us up this way. It's the\r\nAmaranth, sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bent over a speaking tube and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho's on watch down there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA hollow, unhuman voice rumbled up through the tube in answer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am. Second engineer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! You want to stir your stumps, now, Harry--the Amaranth's just\r\nturned the point--and she's just a--humping herself, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pilot took hold of a rope that stretched out forward, jerked it\r\ntwice, and two mellow strokes of the big bell responded. A voice out on\r\nthe deck shouted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand by, down there, with that labboard lead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don't want the lead,\xe2\x80\x9d said the pilot, \xe2\x80\x9cI want you. Roust out the\r\nold man--tell him the Amaranth's coming. And go and call Jim--tell him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye-aye, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cold man\xe2\x80\x9d was the captain--he is always called so, on steamboats and\r\nships; \xe2\x80\x9cJim\xe2\x80\x9d was the other pilot. Within two minutes both of these men\r\nwere flying up the pilothouse stairway, three steps at a jump. Jim was\r\nin his shirt sleeves,--with his coat and vest on his arm. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was just turning in. Where's the glass\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took it and looked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't appear to be any night-hawk on the jack-staff--it's the Amaranth,\r\ndead sure!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain took a good long look, and only said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamnation!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge Davis, the pilot on watch, shouted to the night-watchman on deck:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow's she loaded?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo inches by the head, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'T ain't enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain shouted, now:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall the mate. Tell him to call all hands and get a lot of that sugar\r\nforrard--put her ten inches by the head. Lively, now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAye-aye, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA riot of shouting and trampling floated up from below, presently, and\r\nthe uneasy steering of the boat soon showed that she was getting \xe2\x80\x9cdown\r\nby the head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe three men in the pilot house began to talk in short, sharp\r\nsentences, low and earnestly. As their excitement rose, their voices\r\nwent down. As fast as one of them put down the spy-glass another took\r\nit up--but always with a studied air of calmness. Each time the verdict\r\nwas:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe's a gaining!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain spoke through the tube:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat steam are you carrying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hundred and forty-two, sir! But she's getting hotter and hotter all\r\nthe time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boat was straining and groaning and quivering like a monster in\r\npain. Both pilots were at work now, one on each side of the wheel, with\r\ntheir coats and vests off, their bosoms and collars wide open and the\r\nperspiration flowing down heir faces. They were holding the boat so\r\nclose to the shore that the willows swept the guards almost from stem to\r\nstern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand by!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll ready!\xe2\x80\x9d said Jim, under his breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boat sprang away from the bank like a deer, and darted in a long\r\ndiagonal toward the other shore. She closed in again and thrashed her\r\nfierce way along the willows as before. The captain put down the glass:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord how she walks up on us! I do hate to be beat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJim,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, looking straight ahead, watching the slightest\r\nyawing of the boat and promptly meeting it with the wheel, \xe2\x80\x9chow'll it do\r\nto try Murderer's Chute?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it's--it's taking chances. How was the cottonwood stump on the\r\nfalse point below Boardman's Island this morning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWater just touching the roots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell it's pretty close work. That gives six feet scant in the head of\r\nMurderer's Chute. We can just barely rub through if we hit it exactly\r\nright. But it's worth trying. She don't dare tackle it!\xe2\x80\x9d--meaning the\r\nAmaranth.\r\n\r\nIn another instant the Boreas plunged into what seemed a crooked creek,\r\nand the Amaranth's approaching lights were shut out in a moment. Not\r\na whisper was uttered, now, but the three men stared ahead into the\r\nshadows and two of them spun the wheel back and forth with anxious\r\nwatchfulness while the steamer tore along. The chute seemed to come to\r\nan end every fifty yards, but always opened out in time. Now the head\r\nof it was at hand. George tapped the big bell three times, two leadsmen\r\nsprang to their posts, and in a moment their weird cries rose on the\r\nnight air and were caught up and repeated by two men on the upper deck:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo-o bottom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDe-e-p four!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf three!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuarter three!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMark under wa-a-ter three!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf twain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuarter twain!-----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDavis pulled a couple of ropes--there was a jingling of small bells far\r\nbelow, the boat's speed slackened, and the pent steam began to whistle\r\nand the gauge-cocks to scream:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the mark twain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuar--ter--her--er--less twain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight and a half!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight feet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven-ana-half!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother jingling of little bells and the wheels ceased turning\r\naltogether. The whistling of the steam was something frightful now--it\r\nalmost drowned all other noises.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand by to meet her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge had the wheel hard down and was standing on a spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll ready!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boat hesitated--seemed to hold her breath, as did the captain and\r\npilots--and then she began to fall away to starboard and every eye\r\nlighted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then!--meet her! meet her! Snatch her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wheel flew to port so fast that the spokes blended into a\r\nspider-web--the swing of the boat subsided--she steadied herself----\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven feet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSev--six and a half!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSix feet! Six f----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBang! She hit the bottom! George shouted through the tube:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpread her wide open! Whale it at her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPow-wow-chow! The escape-pipes belched snowy pillars of steam aloft, the\r\nboat ground and surged and trembled--and slid over into----\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM-a-r-k twain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuarter-her----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTap! tap! tap!\xe2\x80\x9d (to signify \xe2\x80\x9cLay in the leads\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\nAnd away she went, flying up the willow shore, with the whole silver sea\r\nof the Mississippi stretching abroad on every hand.\r\n\r\nNo Amaranth in sight!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa-ha, boys, we took a couple of tricks that time!\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain.\r\n\r\nAnd just at that moment a red glare appeared in the head of the chute\r\nand the Amaranth came springing after them!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I swear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJim, what is the meaning of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll tell you what's the meaning of it. That hail we had at Napoleon\r\nwas Wash Hastings, wanting to come to Cairo--and we didn't stop. He's\r\nin that pilot house, now, showing those mud turtles how to hunt for easy\r\nwater.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's it! I thought it wasn't any slouch that was running that middle\r\nbar in Hog-eye Bend. If it's Wash Hastings--well, what he don't know\r\nabout the river ain't worth knowing--a regular gold-leaf, kid-glove,\r\ndiamond breastpin pilot Wash Hastings is. We won't take any tricks off\r\nof him, old man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I'd a stopped for him, that's all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Amaranth was within three hundred yards of the Boreas, and still\r\ngaining. The \xe2\x80\x9cold man\xe2\x80\x9d spoke through the tube:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is she-carrying now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hundred and sixty-five, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow's your wood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPine all out-cypress half gone-eating up cotton-wood like pie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBreak into that rosin on the main deck-pile it in, the boat can pay for\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoon the boat was plunging and quivering and screaming more madly than\r\never. But the Amaranth's head was almost abreast the Boreas's stern:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow's your steam, now, Harry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHundred and eighty-two, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBreak up the casks of bacon in the forrard hold! Pile it in! Levy on\r\nthat turpentine in the fantail-drench every stick of wood with it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boat was a moving earthquake by this time:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is she now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA hundred and ninety-six and still a-swelling!--water, below the middle\r\ngauge-cocks!--carrying every pound she can stand!--nigger roosting on\r\nthe safety-valve!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! How's your draft?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBully! Every time a nigger heaves a stick of wood into the furnace he\r\ngoes out the chimney, with it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Amaranth drew steadily up till her jack-staff breasted the Boreas's\r\nwheel-house--climbed along inch by inch till her chimneys breasted\r\nit--crept along, further and further, till the boats were wheel to\r\nwheel--and then they closed up with a heavy jolt and locked together\r\ntight and fast in the middle of the big river under the flooding\r\nmoonlight! A roar and a hurrah went up from the crowded decks of\r\nboth steamers--all hands rushed to the guards to look and shout\r\nand gesticulate--the weight careened the vessels over toward each\r\nother--officers flew hither and thither cursing and storming, trying\r\nto drive the people amidships--both captains were leaning over their\r\nrailings shaking their fists, swearing and threatening--black volumes\r\nof smoke rolled up and canopied the scene,--delivering a rain of sparks\r\nupon the vessels--two pistol shots rang out, and both captains dodged\r\nunhurt and the packed masses of passengers surged back and fell apart\r\nwhile the shrieks of women and children soared above the intolerable\r\ndin----\r\n\r\nAnd then there was a booming roar, a thundering crash, and the riddled\r\nAmaranth dropped loose from her hold and drifted helplessly away!\r\n\r\nInstantly the fire-doors of the Boreas were thrown open and the men\r\nbegan dashing buckets of water into the furnaces--for it would have been\r\ndeath and destruction to stop the engines with such a head of steam on.\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible the Boreas dropped down to the floating wreck and\r\ntook off the dead, the wounded and the unhurt--at least all that could\r\nbe got at, for the whole forward half of the boat was a shapeless ruin,\r\nwith the great chimneys lying crossed on top of it, and underneath were\r\na dozen victims imprisoned alive and wailing for help. While men with\r\naxes worked with might and main to free these poor fellows, the Boreas's\r\nboats went about, picking up stragglers from the river.\r\n\r\nAnd now a new horror presented itself. The wreck took fire from the\r\ndismantled furnaces! Never did men work with a heartier will than did\r\nthose stalwart braves with the axes. But it was of no use. The fire\r\nate its way steadily, despising the bucket brigade that fought it. It\r\nscorched the clothes, it singed the hair of the axemen--it drove them\r\nback, foot by foot--inch by inch--they wavered, struck a final blow\r\nin the teeth of the enemy, and surrendered. And as they fell back they\r\nheard prisoned voices saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't leave us! Don't desert us! Don't, don't do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd one poor fellow said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Henry Worley, striker of the Amaranth! My mother lives in St.\r\nLouis. Tell her a lie for a poor devil's sake, please. Say I was killed\r\nin an instant and never knew what hurt me--though God knows I've neither\r\nscratch nor bruise this moment! It's hard to burn up in a coop like this\r\nwith the whole wide world so near. Good-bye boys--we've all got to come\r\nto it at last, anyway!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Boreas stood away out of danger, and the ruined steamer went\r\ndrifting down the stream an island of wreathing and climbing flame that\r\nvomited clouds of smoke from time to time, and glared more fiercely\r\nand sent its luminous tongues higher and higher after each emission. A\r\nshriek at intervals told of a captive that had met his doom. The wreck\r\nlodged upon a sandbar, and when the Boreas turned the next point on her\r\nupward journey it was still burning with scarcely abated fury.\r\n\r\nWhen the boys came down into the main saloon of the Boreas, they saw a\r\npitiful sight and heard a world of pitiful sounds. Eleven poor creatures\r\nlay dead and forty more lay moaning, or pleading or screaming, while\r\na score of Good Samaritans moved among them doing what they could to\r\nrelieve their sufferings; bathing their chinless faces and bodies with\r\nlinseed oil and lime water and covering the places with bulging masses\r\nof raw cotton that gave to every face and form a dreadful and unhuman\r\naspect.\r\n\r\nA little wee French midshipman of fourteen lay fearfully injured, but\r\nnever uttered a sound till a physician of Memphis was about to dress his\r\nhurts. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I get well? You need not be afraid to tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--I--I am afraid you can not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen do not waste your time with me--help those that can get well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp those that can get well! It is, not for me to be a girl. I carry\r\nthe blood of eleven generations of soldiers in my veins!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe physician--himself a man who had seen service in the navy in his\r\ntime--touched his hat to this little hero, and passed on.\r\n\r\nThe head engineer of the Amaranth, a grand specimen of physical manhood,\r\nstruggled to his feet a ghastly spectacle and strode toward his brother,\r\nthe second engineer, who was unhurt. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were on watch. You were boss. You would not listen to me when I\r\nbegged you to reduce your steam. Take that!--take it to my wife and tell\r\nher it comes from me by the hand of my murderer! Take it--and take my\r\ncurse with it to blister your heart a hundred years--and may you live so\r\nlong!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he tore a ring from his finger, stripping flesh and skin with it,\r\nthrew it down and fell dead!\r\n\r\nBut these things must not be dwelt upon. The Boreas landed her dreadful\r\ncargo at the next large town and delivered it over to a multitude of\r\neager hands and warm southern hearts--a cargo amounting by this time to\r\n39 wounded persons and 22 dead bodies. And with these she delivered a\r\nlist of 96 missing persons that had drowned or otherwise perished at the\r\nscene of the disaster.\r\n\r\nA jury of inquest was impaneled, and after due deliberation and inquiry\r\nthey returned the inevitable American verdict which has been so familiar\r\nto our ears all the days of our lives--\xe2\x80\x9cNOBODY TO BLAME.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n**[The incidents of the explosion are not invented. They happened just\r\nas they are told.--The Authors.]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nIl veut faire secher de la neige au four et la vendre pour du sel blanc.\r\nWhen the Boreas backed away from the land to continue her voyage up the\r\nriver, the Hawkinses were richer by twenty-four hours of experience in\r\nthe contemplation of human suffering and in learning through honest hard\r\nwork how to relieve it. And they were richer in another way also. In the\r\nearly turmoil an hour after the explosion, a little black-eyed girl of\r\nfive years, frightened and crying bitterly, was struggling through the\r\nthrong in the Boreas' saloon calling her mother and father, but no one\r\nanswered. Something in the face of Mr. Hawkins attracted her and she\r\ncame and looked up at him; was satisfied, and took refuge with him. He\r\npetted her, listened to her troubles, and said he would find her friends\r\nfor her. Then he put her in a state-room with his children and told\r\nthem to be kind to her (the adults of his party were all busy with the\r\nwounded) and straightway began his search.\r\n\r\nIt was fruitless. But all day he and his wife made inquiries, and hoped\r\nagainst hope. All that they could learn was that the child and her\r\nparents came on board at New Orleans, where they had just arrived in a\r\nvessel from Cuba; that they looked like people from the Atlantic States;\r\nthat the family name was Van Brunt and the child's name Laura. This\r\nwas all. The parents had not been seen since the explosion. The child's\r\nmanners were those of a little lady, and her clothes were daintier and\r\nfiner than any Mrs. Hawkins had ever seen before.\r\n\r\nAs the hours dragged on the child lost heart, and cried so piteously\r\nfor her mother that it seemed to the Hawkinses that the moanings and the\r\nwailings of the mutilated men and women in the saloon did not so\r\nstrain at their heart-strings as the sufferings of this little desolate\r\ncreature. They tried hard to comfort her; and in trying, learned to love\r\nher; they could not help it, seeing how she clung, to them and put her\r\narms about their necks and found no solace but in their kind eyes and\r\ncomforting words: There was a question in both their hearts--a question\r\nthat rose up and asserted itself with more and more pertinacity as\r\nthe hours wore on--but both hesitated to give it voice--both kept\r\nsilence--and--waited. But a time came at last when the matter would bear\r\ndelay no longer. The boat had landed, and the dead and the wounded were\r\nbeing conveyed to the shore. The tired child was asleep in the arms of\r\nMrs. Hawkins. Mr. Hawkins came into their presence and stood without\r\nspeaking. His eyes met his wife's; then both looked at the child--and as\r\nthey looked it stirred in its sleep and nestled closer; an expression\r\nof contentment and peace settled upon its face that touched the\r\nmother-heart; and when the eyes of husband and wife met again, the\r\nquestion was asked and answered.\r\n\r\nWhen the Boreas had journeyed some four hundred miles from the time the\r\nHawkinses joined her, a long rank of steamboats was sighted, packed side\r\nby side at a wharf like sardines, in a box, and above and beyond them\r\nrose the domes and steeples and general architectural confusion of a\r\ncity--a city with an imposing umbrella of black smoke spread over it.\r\nThis was St. Louis. The children of the Hawkins family were playing\r\nabout the hurricane deck, and the father and mother were sitting in the\r\nlee of the pilot house essaying to keep order and not greatly grieved\r\nthat they were not succeeding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey're worth all the trouble they are, Nancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and more, Si.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you! You wouldn't sell one of them at a good round figure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for all the money in the bank, Si.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own sentiments every time. It is true we are not rich--but still you\r\nare not sorry---you haven't any misgivings about the additions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. God will provide\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen. And so you wouldn't even part with Clay? Or Laura!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for anything in the world. I love them just the same as I love my\r\nown: They pet me and spoil me even more than the others do, I think. I\r\nreckon we'll get along, Si.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, it will all come out right, old mother. I wouldn't be afraid\r\nto adopt a thousand children if I wanted to, for there's that Tennessee\r\nLand, you know--enough to make an army of them rich. A whole army,\r\nNancy! You and I will never see the day, but these little chaps will.\r\nIndeed they will. One of these days it will be the rich Miss Emily\r\nHawkins--and the wealthy Miss Laura Van Brunt Hawkins--and the Hon.\r\nGeorge Washington Hawkins, millionaire--and Gov. Henry Clay Hawkins,\r\nmillionaire! That is the way the world will word it! Don't let's ever\r\nfret about the children, Nancy--never in the world. They're all right.\r\nNancy, there's oceans and oceans of money in that land--mark my words!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe children had stopped playing, for the moment, and drawn near to\r\nlisten. Hawkins said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWashington, my boy, what will you do when you get to be one of the\r\nrichest men in the world?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know, father. Sometimes I think I'll have a balloon and go\r\nup in the air; and sometimes I think I'll have ever so many books; and\r\nsometimes I think I'll have ever so many weathercocks and water-wheels;\r\nor have a machine like that one you and Colonel Sellers bought; and\r\nsometimes I think I'll have--well, somehow I don't know--somehow I ain't\r\ncertain; maybe I'll get a steamboat first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same old chap!--always just a little bit divided about things.--And\r\nwhat will you do when you get to be one of the richest men in the world,\r\nClay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know, sir. My mother--my other mother that's gone away--she\r\nalways told me to work along and not be much expecting to get rich, and\r\nthen I wouldn't be disappointed if I didn't get rich. And so I reckon\r\nit's better for me to wait till I get rich, and then by that time maybe\r\nI'll know what I'll want--but I don't now, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCareful old head!--Governor Henry Clay Hawkins!--that's what you'll be,\r\nClay, one of these days. Wise old head! weighty old head! Go on, now,\r\nand play--all of you. It's a prime lot, Nancy; as the Obedstown folk say\r\nabout their hogs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA smaller steamboat received the Hawkinses and their fortunes, and bore\r\nthem a hundred and thirty miles still higher up the Mississippi, and\r\nlanded them at a little tumble-down village on the Missouri shore in the\r\ntwilight of a mellow October day.\r\n\r\nThe next morning they harnessed up their team and for two days they\r\nwended slowly into the interior through almost roadless and uninhabited\r\nforest solitudes. And when for the last time they pitched their tents,\r\nmetaphorically speaking, it was at the goal of their hopes, their new\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nBy the muddy roadside stood a new log cabin, one story high--the store;\r\nclustered in the neighborhood were ten or twelve more cabins, some new,\r\nsome old.\r\n\r\nIn the sad light of the departing day the place looked homeless enough.\r\nTwo or three coatless young men sat in front of the store on a dry-goods\r\nbox, and whittled it with their knives, kicked it with their vast boots,\r\nand shot tobacco-juice at various marks. Several ragged negroes leaned\r\ncomfortably against the posts of the awning and contemplated the arrival\r\nof the wayfarers with lazy curiosity. All these people presently managed\r\nto drag themselves to the vicinity of the Hawkins' wagon, and there they\r\ntook up permanent positions, hands in pockets and resting on one leg;\r\nand thus anchored they proceeded to look and enjoy. Vagrant dogs came\r\nwagging around and making inquiries of Hawkins's dog, which were not\r\nsatisfactory and they made war on him in concert. This would have\r\ninterested the citizens but it was too many on one to amount to anything\r\nas a fight, and so they commanded the peace and the foreign dog coiled\r\nhis tail and took sanctuary under the wagon. Slatternly negro girls\r\nand women slouched along with pails deftly balanced on their heads, and\r\njoined the group and stared. Little half dressed white boys, and little\r\nnegro boys with nothing whatever on but tow-linen shirts with a fine\r\nsouthern exposure, came from various directions and stood with their\r\nhands locked together behind them and aided in the inspection. The rest\r\nof the population were laying down their employments and getting\r\nready to come, when a man burst through the assemblage and seized the\r\nnew-comers by the hands in a frenzy of welcome, and exclaimed--indeed\r\nalmost shouted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell who could have believed it! Now is it you sure enough--turn\r\naround! hold up your heads! I want to look at you good! Well, well,\r\nwell, it does seem most too good to be true, I declare! Lord, I'm so\r\nglad to see you! Does a body's whole soul good to look at you! Shake\r\nhands again! Keep on shaking hands! Goodness gracious alive. What will\r\nmy wife say?--Oh yes indeed, it's so!--married only last week--lovely,\r\nperfectly lovely creature, the noblest woman that ever--you'll like\r\nher, Nancy! Like her? Lord bless me you'll love her--you'll dote on\r\nher--you'll be twins! Well, well, well, let me look at you again! Same\r\nold--why bless my life it was only jest this very morning that my wife\r\nsays, 'Colonel'--she will call me Colonel spite of everything I can\r\ndo--she says 'Colonel, something tells me somebody's coming!' and\r\nsure enough here you are, the last people on earth a body could have\r\nexpected. Why she'll think she's a prophetess--and hanged if I don't\r\nthink so too--and you know there ain't any country but what a prophet's\r\nan honor to, as the proverb says. Lord bless me and here's the children,\r\ntoo! Washington, Emily, don't you know me? Come, give us a kiss. Won't\r\nI fix you, though!--ponies, cows, dogs, everything you can think of\r\nthat'll delight a child's heart--and--Why how's this? Little strangers?\r\nWell you won't be any strangers here, I can tell you. Bless your souls\r\nwe'll make you think you never was at home before--'deed and 'deed we\r\nwill, I can tell you! Come, now, bundle right along with me. You can't\r\nglorify any hearth stone but mine in this camp, you know--can't eat\r\nanybody's bread but mine--can't do anything but just make yourselves\r\nperfectly at home and comfortable, and spread yourselves out and rest!\r\nYou hear me! Here--Jim, Tom, Pete, Jake, fly around! Take that team to\r\nmy place--put the wagon in my lot--put the horses under the shed, and\r\nget out hay and oats and fill them up! Ain't any hay and oats? Well get\r\nsome--have it charged to me--come, spin around, now! Now, Hawkins, the\r\nprocession's ready; mark time, by the left flank, forward-march!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the Colonel took the lead, with Laura astride his neck, and the\r\nnewly-inspired and very grateful immigrants picked up their tired limbs\r\nwith quite a spring in them and dropped into his wake.\r\n\r\nPresently they were ranged about an old-time fire-place whose blazing\r\nlogs sent out rather an unnecessary amount of heat, but that was no\r\nmatter--supper was needed, and to have it, it had to be cooked. This\r\napartment was the family bedroom, parlor, library and kitchen, all in\r\none. The matronly little wife of the Colonel moved hither and thither\r\nand in and out with her pots and pans in her hands, happiness in her\r\nheart and a world of admiration of her husband in her eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd when at last she had spread the cloth and loaded it with hot corn\r\nbread, fried chickens, bacon, buttermilk, coffee, and all manner of\r\ncountry luxuries, Col. Sellers modified his harangue and for a moment\r\nthrottled it down to the orthodox pitch for a blessing, and then\r\ninstantly burst forth again as from a parenthesis and clattered on with\r\nmight and main till every stomach in the party was laden with all\r\nit could carry. And when the new-comers ascended the ladder to their\r\ncomfortable feather beds on the second floor--to wit the garret--Mrs.\r\nHawkins was obliged to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang the fellow, I do believe he has gone wilder than ever, but still\r\na body can't help liking him if they would--and what is more, they don't\r\never want to try when they see his eyes and hear him talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithin a week or two the Hawkinses were comfortably domiciled in a new\r\nlog house, and were beginning to feel at home. The children were put to\r\nschool; at least it was what passed for a school in those days: a place\r\nwhere tender young humanity devoted itself for eight or ten hours a day\r\nto learning incomprehensible rubbish by heart out of books and reciting\r\nit by rote, like parrots; so that a finished education consisted simply\r\nof a permanent headache and the ability to read without stopping to\r\nspell the words or take breath. Hawkins bought out the village store for\r\na song and proceeded to reap the profits, which amounted to but little\r\nmore than another song.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful speculation hinted at by Col. Sellers in his letter turned\r\nout to be the raising of mules for the Southern market; and really it\r\npromised very well. The young stock cost but a trifle, the rearing\r\nbut another trifle, and so Hawkins was easily persuaded to embark his\r\nslender means in the enterprise and turn over the keep and care of the\r\nanimals to Sellers and Uncle Dan'l.\r\n\r\nAll went well: Business prospered little by little. Hawkins even built a\r\nnew house, made it two full stories high and put a lightning rod on it.\r\nPeople came two or three miles to look at it. But they knew that the rod\r\nattracted the lightning, and so they gave the place a wide berth in\r\na storm, for they were familiar with marksmanship and doubted if the\r\nlightning could hit that small stick at a distance of a mile and a half\r\noftener than once in a hundred and fifty times. Hawkins fitted out\r\nhis house with \xe2\x80\x9cstore\xe2\x80\x9d furniture from St. Louis, and the fame of its\r\nmagnificence went abroad in the land. Even the parlor carpet was from\r\nSt. Louis--though the other rooms were clothed in the \xe2\x80\x9crag\xe2\x80\x9d carpeting\r\nof the country. Hawkins put up the first \xe2\x80\x9cpaling\xe2\x80\x9d fence that had ever\r\nadorned the village; and he did not stop there, but whitewashed it. His\r\noil-cloth window-curtains had noble pictures on them of castles such\r\nas had never been seen anywhere in the world but on window-curtains.\r\nHawkins enjoyed the admiration these prodigies compelled, but he always\r\nsmiled to think how poor and cheap they were, compared to what the\r\nHawkins mansion would display in a future day after the Tennessee Land\r\nshould have borne its minted fruit. Even Washington observed, once, that\r\nwhen the Tennessee Land was sold he would have a \xe2\x80\x9cstore\xe2\x80\x9d carpet in his\r\nand Clay's room like the one in the parlor. This pleased Hawkins, but\r\nit troubled his wife. It did not seem wise, to her, to put one's entire\r\nearthly trust in the Tennessee Land and never think of doing any work.\r\n\r\nHawkins took a weekly Philadelphia newspaper and a semi-weekly St. Louis\r\njournal--almost the only papers that came to the village, though Godey's\r\nLady's Book found a good market there and was regarded as the perfection\r\nof polite literature by some of the ablest critics in the place. Perhaps\r\nit is only fair to explain that we are writing of a by gone age--some\r\ntwenty or thirty years ago. In the two newspapers referred to lay the\r\nsecret of Hawkins's growing prosperity. They kept him informed of the\r\ncondition of the crops south and east, and thus he knew which articles\r\nwere likely to be in demand and which articles were likely to be\r\nunsalable, weeks and even months in advance of the simple folk about\r\nhim. As the months went by he came to be regarded as a wonderfully lucky\r\nman. It did not occur to the citizens that brains were at the bottom of\r\nhis luck.\r\n\r\nHis title of \xe2\x80\x9cSquire\xe2\x80\x9d came into vogue again, but only for a season; for,\r\nas his wealth and popularity augmented, that title, by imperceptible\r\nstages, grew up into \xe2\x80\x9cJudge;\xe2\x80\x9d indeed it bade fair to swell into\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeneral\xe2\x80\x9d bye and bye. All strangers of consequence who visited the\r\nvillage gravitated to the Hawkins Mansion and became guests of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJudge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawkins had learned to like the people of his section very much. They\r\nwere uncouth and not cultivated, and not particularly industrious; but\r\nthey were honest and straightforward, and their virtuous ways commanded\r\nrespect. Their patriotism was strong, their pride in the flag was of\r\nthe old fashioned pattern, their love of country amounted to idolatry.\r\nWhoever dragged the national honor in the dirt won their deathless\r\nhatred. They still cursed Benedict Arnold as if he were a personal\r\nfriend who had broken faith--but a week gone by.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nWe skip ten years and this history finds certain changes to record.\r\nJudge Hawkins and Col. Sellers have made and lost two or three moderate\r\nfortunes in the meantime and are now pinched by poverty. Sellers has two\r\npairs of twins and four extras. In Hawkins's family are six children of\r\nhis own and two adopted ones. From time to time, as fortune smiled,\r\nthe elder children got the benefit of it, spending the lucky seasons\r\nat excellent schools in St. Louis and the unlucky ones at home in the\r\nchafing discomfort of straightened circumstances.\r\n\r\nNeither the Hawkins children nor the world that knew them ever supposed\r\nthat one of the girls was of alien blood and parentage: Such difference\r\nas existed between Laura and Emily is not uncommon in a family. The\r\ngirls had grown up as sisters, and they were both too young at the time\r\nof the fearful accident on the Mississippi to know that it was that\r\nwhich had thrown their lives together.\r\n\r\nAnd yet any one who had known the secret of Laura's birth and had\r\nseen her during these passing years, say at the happy age of twelve or\r\nthirteen, would have fancied that he knew the reason why she was more\r\nwinsome than her school companion.\r\n\r\nPhilosophers dispute whether it is the promise of what she will be in\r\nthe careless school-girl, that makes her attractive, the undeveloped\r\nmaidenhood, or the mere natural, careless sweetness of childhood. If\r\nLaura at twelve was beginning to be a beauty, the thought of it had\r\nnever entered her head. No, indeed. Her mind was filled with more\r\nimportant thoughts. To her simple school-girl dress she was beginning\r\nto add those mysterious little adornments of ribbon-knots and ear-rings,\r\nwhich were the subject of earnest consultations with her grown friends.\r\n\r\nWhen she tripped down the street on a summer's day with her dainty\r\nhands propped into the ribbon-broidered pockets of her apron, and elbows\r\nconsequently more or less akimbo with her wide Leghorn hat flapping down\r\nand hiding her face one moment and blowing straight up against her fore\r\nhead the next and making its revealment of fresh young beauty; with\r\nall her pretty girlish airs and graces in full play, and that sweet\r\nignorance of care and that atmosphere of innocence and purity all about\r\nher that belong to her gracious time of life, indeed she was a vision to\r\nwarm the coldest heart and bless and cheer the saddest.\r\n\r\nWillful, generous, forgiving, imperious, affectionate, improvident,\r\nbewitching, in short--was Laura at this period. Could she have remained\r\nthere, this history would not need to be written. But Laura had grown\r\nto be almost a woman in these few years, to the end of which we have now\r\ncome--years which had seen Judge Hawkins pass through so many trials.\r\n\r\nWhen the judge's first bankruptcy came upon him, a homely human angel\r\nintruded upon him with an offer of $1,500 for the Tennessee Land.\r\nMrs. Hawkins said take it. It was a grievous temptation, but the judge\r\nwithstood it. He said the land was for the children--he could not rob\r\nthem of their future millions for so paltry a sum. When the second\r\nblight fell upon him, another angel appeared and offered $3,000 for the\r\nland. He was in such deep distress that he allowed his wife to persuade\r\nhim to let the papers be drawn; but when his children came into his\r\npresence in their poor apparel, he felt like a traitor and refused to\r\nsign.\r\n\r\nBut now he was down again, and deeper in the mire than ever. He paced\r\nthe floor all day, he scarcely slept at night. He blushed even\r\nto acknowledge it to himself, but treason was in his mind--he was\r\nmeditating, at last, the sale of the land. Mrs. Hawkins stepped into\r\nthe room. He had not spoken a word, but he felt as guilty as if she had\r\ncaught him in some shameful act. She said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSi, I do not know what we are going to do. The children are not fit to\r\nbe seen, their clothes are in such a state. But there's something more\r\nserious still.--There is scarcely a bite in the house to eat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Nancy, go to Johnson----.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohnson indeed! You took that man's part when he hadn't a friend in the\r\nworld, and you built him up and made him rich. And here's the result of\r\nit: He lives in our fine house, and we live in his miserable log cabin.\r\nHe has hinted to our children that he would rather they wouldn't come\r\nabout his yard to play with his children,--which I can bear, and bear\r\neasy enough, for they're not a sort we want to associate with much--but\r\nwhat I can't bear with any quietness at all, is his telling Franky\r\nour bill was running pretty high this morning when I sent him for some\r\nmeal--and that was all he said, too--didn't give him the meal--turned\r\noff and went to talking with the Hargrave girls about some stuff they\r\nwanted to cheapen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNancy, this is astounding!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so it is, I warrant you. I've kept still, Si, as long as ever I\r\ncould. Things have been getting worse and worse, and worse and worse,\r\nevery single day; I don't go out of the house, I feel so down; but you\r\nhad trouble enough, and I wouldn't say a word--and I wouldn't say a word\r\nnow, only things have got so bad that I don't know what to do, nor where\r\nto turn.\xe2\x80\x9d And she gave way and put her face in her hands and cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor child, don't grieve so. I never thought that of Johnson. I am\r\nclear at my wit's end. I don't know what in the world to do. Now if\r\nsomebody would come along and offer $3,000--Uh, if somebody only would\r\ncome along and offer $3,000 for that Tennessee Land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'd sell it, Si!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Hawkins excitedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Hawkins was out of the room in a moment. Within a minute she was\r\nback again with a business-looking stranger, whom she seated, and then\r\nshe took her leave again. Hawkins said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cHow can a man ever\r\nlose faith? When the blackest hour comes, Providence always comes with\r\nit--ah, this is the very timeliest help that ever poor harried devil\r\nhad; if this blessed man offers but a thousand I'll embrace him like a\r\nbrother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am aware that you own 75,000 acres, of land in East Tennessee, and\r\nwithout sacrificing your time, I will come to the point at once. I am\r\nagent of an iron manufacturing company, and they empower me to offer you\r\nten thousand dollars for that land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawkins's heart bounded within him. His whole frame was racked and\r\nwrenched with fettered hurrahs. His first impulse was to shout \xe2\x80\x9cDone!\r\nand God bless the iron company, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut a something flitted through his mind, and his opened lips uttered\r\nnothing. The enthusiasm faded away from his eyes, and the look of a man\r\nwho is thinking took its place. Presently, in a hesitating, undecided\r\nway, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I--it don't seem quite enough. That--that is a very valuable\r\nproperty--very valuable. It's brim full of iron-ore, sir--brim full of\r\nit! And copper, coal,--everything--everything you can think of! Now,\r\nI'll tell you what I'll do. I'll reserve everything except the iron, and\r\nI'll sell them the iron property for $15,000 cash, I to go in with them\r\nand own an undivided interest of one-half the concern--or the stock,\r\nas you may say. I'm out of business, and I'd just as soon help run the\r\nthing as not. Now how does that strike you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am only an agent of these people, who are friends of mine, and\r\nI am not even paid for my services. To tell you the truth, I have tried\r\nto persuade them not to go into the thing; and I have come square out\r\nwith their offer, without throwing out any feelers--and I did it in the\r\nhope that you would refuse. A man pretty much always refuses another\r\nman's first offer, no matter what it is. But I have performed my duty,\r\nand will take pleasure in telling them what you say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was about to rise. Hawkins said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHawkins thought again. And the substance of his thought was: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\na deep man; this is a very deep man; I don't like his candor; your\r\nostentatiously candid business man's a deep fox--always a deep fox;\r\nthis man's that iron company himself--that's what he is; he wants that\r\nproperty, too; I am not so blind but I can see that; he don't want the\r\ncompany to go into this thing--O, that's very good; yes, that's very\r\ngood indeed--stuff! he'll be back here tomorrow, sure, and take my\r\noffer; take it? I'll risk anything he is suffering to take it now;\r\nhere--I must mind what I'm about. What has started this sudden\r\nexcitement about iron? I wonder what is in the wind? just as sure as\r\nI'm alive this moment, there's something tremendous stirring in iron\r\nspeculation\xe2\x80\x9d [here Hawkins got up and began to pace the floor with\r\nexcited eyes and with gesturing hands]--\xe2\x80\x9csomething enormous going on in\r\niron, without the shadow of a doubt, and here I sit mousing in the dark\r\nand never knowing anything about it; great heaven, what an escape I've\r\nmade! this underhanded mercenary creature might have taken me up--and\r\nruined me! but I have escaped, and I warrant me I'll not put my foot\r\ninto--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped and turned toward the stranger; saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have made you a proposition, you have not accepted it, and I desire\r\nthat you will consider that I have made none. At the same time my\r\nconscience will not allow me to--. Please alter the figures I named to\r\nthirty thousand dollars, if you will, and let the proposition go to the\r\ncompany--I will stick to it if it breaks my heart!\xe2\x80\x9d The stranger looked\r\namused, and there was a pretty well defined touch of surprise in his\r\nexpression, too, but Hawkins never noticed it. Indeed he scarcely\r\nnoticed anything or knew what he was about. The man left; Hawkins flung\r\nhimself into a chair; thought a few moments, then glanced around, looked\r\nfrightened, sprang to the door----\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo late--too late! He's gone! Fool that I am! always a fool! Thirty\r\nthousand--ass that I am! Oh, why didn't I say fifty thousand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe plunged his hands into his hair and leaned his elbows on his knees,\r\nand fell to rocking himself back and forth in anguish. Mrs. Hawkins\r\nsprang in, beaming:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Si?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, con-found the con-founded--con-found it, Nancy. I've gone and done\r\nit, now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone what Si for mercy's sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone everything! Ruined everything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, tell me, tell me! Don't keep a body in such suspense. Didn't\r\nhe buy, after all? Didn't he make an offer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOffer? He offered $10,000 for our land, and----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank the good providence from the very bottom of my heart of hearts!\r\nWhat sort of ruin do you call that, Si!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNancy, do you suppose I listened to such a preposterous proposition?\r\nNo! Thank fortune I'm not a simpleton! I saw through the pretty scheme\r\nin a second. It's a vast iron speculation!--millions upon millions in\r\nit! But fool as I am I told him he could have half the iron property for\r\nthirty thousand--and if I only had him back here he couldn't touch it\r\nfor a cent less than a quarter of a million!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Hawkins looked up white and despairing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou threw away this chance, you let this man go, and we in this awful\r\ntrouble? You don't mean it, you can't mean it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrow it away? Catch me at it! Why woman, do you suppose that man don't\r\nknow what he is about? Bless you, he'll be back fast enough to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, never, never. He never will comeback. I don't know what is to\r\nbecome of us. I don't know what in the world is to become of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA shade of uneasiness came into Hawkins's face. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Nancy, you--you can't believe what you are saying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve it, indeed? I know it, Si. And I know that we haven't a cent in\r\nthe world, and we've sent ten thousand dollars a-begging.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNancy, you frighten me. Now could that man--is it possible that\r\nI--hanged if I don't believe I have missed a chance! Don't grieve,\r\nNancy, don't grieve. I'll go right after him. I'll take--I'll take--what\r\na fool I am!--I'll take anything he'll give!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next instant he left the house on a run. But the man was no longer\r\nin the town. Nobody knew where he belonged or whither he had gone.\r\nHawkins came slowly back, watching wistfully but hopelessly for the\r\nstranger, and lowering his price steadily with his sinking heart. And\r\nwhen his foot finally pressed his own threshold, the value he held the\r\nentire Tennessee property at was five hundred dollars--two hundred down\r\nand the rest in three equal annual payments, without interest.\r\n\r\nThere was a sad gathering at the Hawkins fireside the next night. All\r\nthe children were present but Clay. Mr. Hawkins said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWashington, we seem to be hopelessly fallen, hopelessly involved. I am\r\nready to give up. I do not know where to turn--I never have been down so\r\nlow before, I never have seen things so dismal. There are many mouths\r\nto feed; Clay is at work; we must lose you, also, for a little while, my\r\nboy. But it will not be long--the Tennessee land----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and was conscious of a blush. There was silence for a\r\nmoment, and then Washington--now a lank, dreamy-eyed stripling between\r\ntwenty-two and twenty-three years of age--said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Col. Sellers would come for me, I would go and stay with him a\r\nwhile, till the Tennessee land is sold. He has often wanted me to come,\r\never since he moved to Hawkeye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm afraid he can't well come for you, Washington. From what I can\r\nhear--not from him of course, but from others--he is not far from as bad\r\noff as we are--and his family is as large, too. He might find something\r\nfor you to do, maybe, but you'd better try to get to him yourself,\r\nWashington--it's only thirty miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can I, father? There's no stage or anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if there were, stages require money. A stage goes from Swansea,\r\nfive miles from here. But it would be cheaper to walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, they must know you there, and no doubt they would credit you in\r\na moment, for a little stage ride like that. Couldn't you write and ask\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn't you, Washington--seeing it's you that wants the ride? And what\r\ndo you think you'll do, Washington, when you get to Hawkeye? Finish your\r\ninvention for making window-glass opaque?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, I have given that up. I almost knew I could do it, but it was\r\nso tedious and troublesome I quit it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was afraid of it, my boy. Then I suppose you'll finish your plan of\r\ncoloring hen's eggs by feeding a peculiar diet to the hen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir. I believe I have found out the stuff that will do it, but it\r\nkills the hen; so I have dropped that for the present, though I can take\r\nit up again some day when I learn how to manage the mixture better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what have you got on hand--anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, three or four things. I think they are all good and can all\r\nbe done, but they are tiresome, and besides they require money. But as\r\nsoon as the land is sold----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEmily, were you about to say something?\xe2\x80\x9d said Hawkins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. If you are willing, I will go to St. Louis. That will make\r\nanother mouth less to feed. Mrs. Buckner has always wanted me to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the money, child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy I think she would send it, if you would write her--and I know she\r\nwould wait for her pay till----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Laura, let's hear from you, my girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEmily and Laura were about the same age--between seventeen and eighteen.\r\nEmily was fair and pretty, girlish and diffident--blue eyes and light\r\nhair. Laura had a proud bearing, and a somewhat mature look; she had\r\nfine, clean-cut features, her complexion was pure white and contrasted\r\nvividly with her black hair and eyes; she was not what one calls\r\npretty--she was beautiful. She said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go to St. Louis, too, sir. I will find a way to get there. I\r\nwill make a way. And I will find a way to help myself along, and do what\r\nI can to help the rest, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke it like a princess. Mrs. Hawkins smiled proudly and kissed\r\nher, saying in a tone of fond reproof:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo one of my girls is going to turn out and work for her living! It's\r\nlike your pluck and spirit, child, but we will hope that we haven't got\r\nquite down to that, yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl's eyes beamed affection under her mother's caress. Then she\r\nstraightened up, folded her white hands in her lap and became a splendid\r\nice-berg. Clay's dog put up his brown nose for a little attention, and\r\ngot it. He retired under the table with an apologetic yelp, which did\r\nnot affect the iceberg.\r\n\r\nJudge Hawkins had written and asked Clay to return home and consult with\r\nhim upon family affairs. He arrived the evening after this conversation,\r\nand the whole household gave him a rapturous welcome. He brought sadly\r\nneeded help with him, consisting of the savings of a year and a half of\r\nwork--nearly two hundred dollars in money.\r\n\r\nIt was a ray of sunshine which (to this easy household) was the earnest\r\nof a clearing sky.\r\n\r\nBright and early in the morning the family were astir, and all were\r\nbusy preparing Washington for his journey--at least all but Washington\r\nhimself, who sat apart, steeped in a reverie. When the time for his\r\ndeparture came, it was easy to see how fondly all loved him and how hard\r\nit was to let him go, notwithstanding they had often seen him go before,\r\nin his St. Louis schooling days. In the most matter-of-course way they\r\nhad borne the burden of getting him ready for his trip, never seeming\r\nto think of his helping in the matter; in the same matter-of-course way\r\nClay had hired a horse and cart; and now that the good-byes were ended\r\nhe bundled Washington's baggage in and drove away with the exile.\r\n\r\nAt Swansea Clay paid his stage fare, stowed him away in the vehicle,\r\nand saw him off. Then he returned home and reported progress, like a\r\ncommittee of the whole.\r\n\r\nClay remained at home several days. He held many consultations with his\r\nmother upon the financial condition of the family, and talked once with\r\nhis father upon the same subject, but only once. He found a change in\r\nthat quarter which was distressing; years of fluctuating fortune had\r\ndone their work; each reverse had weakened the father's spirit and\r\nimpaired his energies; his last misfortune seemed to have left hope and\r\nambition dead within him; he had no projects, formed no plans--evidently\r\nhe was a vanquished man. He looked worn and tired. He inquired into\r\nClay's affairs and prospects, and when he found that Clay was doing\r\npretty well and was likely to do still better, it was plain that he\r\nresigned himself with easy facility to look to the son for a support;\r\nand he said, \xe2\x80\x9cKeep yourself informed of poor Washington's condition and\r\nmovements, and help him along all you can, Clay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe younger children, also, seemed relieved of all fears and distresses,\r\nand very ready and willing to look to Clay for a livelihood. Within\r\nthree days a general tranquility and satisfaction reigned in the\r\nhousehold. Clay's hundred and eighty or ninety, dollars had worked a\r\nwonder. The family were as contented, now, and as free from care as they\r\ncould have been with a fortune. It was well that Mrs. Hawkins held the\r\npurse otherwise the treasure would have lasted but a very little while.\r\n\r\nIt took but a trifle to pay Hawkins's outstanding obligations, for he\r\nhad always had a horror of debt.\r\n\r\nWhen Clay bade his home good-bye and set out to return to the field of\r\nhis labors, he was conscious that henceforth he was to have his father's\r\nfamily on his hands as pensioners; but he did not allow himself to chafe\r\nat the thought, for he reasoned that his father had dealt by him with a\r\nfree hand and a loving one all his life, and now that hard fortune had\r\nbroken his spirit it ought to be a pleasure, not a pain, to work for\r\nhim. The younger children were born and educated dependents. They had\r\nnever been taught to do anything for themselves, and it did not seem to\r\noccur to them to make an attempt now.\r\n\r\nThe girls would not have been permitted to work for a living under any\r\ncircumstances whatever. It was a southern family, and of good blood; and\r\nfor any person except Laura, either within or without the household to\r\nhave suggested such an idea would have brought upon the suggester the\r\nsuspicion of being a lunatic.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n     Via, Pecunia! when she's run and gone\r\n     And fled, and dead, then will I fetch her again\r\n     With aqua vita, out of an old hogshead!\r\n     While there are lees of wine, or dregs of beer,\r\n     I'll never want her! Coin her out of cobwebs,\r\n     Dust, but I'll have her! raise wool upon egg-shells,\r\n     Sir, and make grass grow out of marrow-bones,\r\n     To make her come!\r\n     B. Jonson.\r\n\r\nBearing Washington Hawkins and his fortunes, the stage-coach tore out\r\nof Swansea at a fearful gait, with horn tooting gaily and half the town\r\nadmiring from doors and windows. But it did not tear any more after it\r\ngot to the outskirts; it dragged along stupidly enough, then--till it\r\ncame in sight of the next hamlet; and then the bugle tooted gaily again\r\nand again the vehicle went tearing by the horses. This sort of conduct\r\nmarked every entry to a station and every exit from it; and so in those\r\ndays children grew up with the idea that stage-coaches always tore and\r\nalways tooted; but they also grew up with the idea that pirates went\r\ninto action in their Sunday clothes, carrying the black flag in one\r\nhand and pistolling people with the other, merely because they were so\r\nrepresented in the pictures--but these illusions vanished when later\r\nyears brought their disenchanting wisdom. They learned then that the\r\nstagecoach is but a poor, plodding, vulgar thing in the solitudes of the\r\nhighway; and that the pirate is only a seedy, unfantastic \xe2\x80\x9crough,\xe2\x80\x9d when\r\nhe is out of the pictures.\r\n\r\nToward evening, the stage-coach came thundering into Hawkeye with a\r\nperfectly triumphant ostentation--which was natural and proper, for\r\nHawkey a was a pretty large town for interior Missouri. Washington,\r\nvery stiff and tired and hungry, climbed out, and wondered how he was\r\nto proceed now. But his difficulty was quickly solved. Col. Sellers came\r\ndown the street on a run and arrived panting for breath. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord bless you--I'm glad to see you, Washington--perfectly delighted to\r\nsee you, my boy! I got your message. Been on the look-out for you. Heard\r\nthe stage horn, but had a party I couldn't shake off--man that's got an\r\nenormous thing on hand--wants me to put some capital into it--and I tell\r\nyou, my boy, I could do worse, I could do a deal worse. No, now, let\r\nthat luggage alone; I'll fix that. Here, Jerry, got anything to do? All\r\nright-shoulder this plunder and follow me. Come along, Washington. Lord\r\nI'm glad to see you! Wife and the children are just perishing to look at\r\nyou. Bless you, they won't know you, you've grown so. Folks all well, I\r\nsuppose? That's good--glad to hear that. We're always going to run down\r\nand see them, but I'm into so many operations, and they're not things a\r\nman feels like trusting to other people, and so somehow we keep putting\r\nit off. Fortunes in them! Good gracious, it's the country to pile up\r\nwealth in! Here we are--here's where the Sellers dynasty hangs out.\r\nHump it on the door-step, Jerry--the blackest niggro in the State,\r\nWashington, but got a good heart--mighty likely boy, is Jerry. And now\r\nI suppose you've got to have ten cents, Jerry. That's all right--when\r\na man works for me--when a man--in the other pocket, I reckon--when\r\na man--why, where the mischief as that portmonnaie!--when a--well now\r\nthat's odd--Oh, now I remember, must have left it at the bank; and\r\nb'George I've left my check-book, too--Polly says I ought to have\r\na nurse--well, no matter. Let me have a dime, Washington, if you've\r\ngot--ah, thanks. Now clear out, Jerry, your complexion has brought on\r\nthe twilight half an hour ahead of time. Pretty fair joke--pretty fair.\r\nHere he is, Polly! Washington's come, children! come now, don't eat him\r\nup--finish him in the house. Welcome, my boy, to a mansion that is proud\r\nto shelter the son of the best man that walks on the ground. Si Hawkins\r\nhas been a good friend to me, and I believe I can say that whenever\r\nI've had a chance to put him into a good thing I've done it, and done\r\nit pretty cheerfully, too. I put him into that sugar speculation--what a\r\ngrand thing that was, if we hadn't held on too long!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTrue enough; but holding on too long had utterly ruined both of them;\r\nand the saddest part of it was, that they never had had so much money\r\nto lose before, for Sellers's sale of their mule crop that year in New\r\nOrleans had been a great financial success. If he had kept out of sugar\r\nand gone back home content to stick to mules it would have been a happy\r\nwisdom. As it was, he managed to kill two birds with one stone--that is\r\nto say, he killed the sugar speculation by holding for high rates till\r\nhe had to sell at the bottom figure, and that calamity killed the mule\r\nthat laid the golden egg--which is but a figurative expression and will\r\nbe so understood. Sellers had returned home cheerful but empty-handed,\r\nand the mule business lapsed into other hands. The sale of the Hawkins\r\nproperty by the Sheriff had followed, and the Hawkins hearts been torn\r\nto see Uncle Dan'l and his wife pass from the auction-block into the\r\nhands of a negro trader and depart for the remote South to be seen no\r\nmore by the family. It had seemed like seeing their own flesh and blood\r\nsold into banishment.\r\n\r\nWashington was greatly pleased with the Sellers mansion. It was a\r\ntwo-story-and-a-half brick, and much more stylish than any of its\r\nneighbors. He was borne to the family sitting room in triumph by the\r\nswarm of little Sellerses, the parents following with their arms about\r\neach other's waists.\r\n\r\nThe whole family were poorly and cheaply dressed; and the clothing,\r\nalthough neat and clean, showed many evidences of having seen long\r\nservice. The Colonel's \xe2\x80\x9cstovepipe\xe2\x80\x9d hat was napless and shiny with much\r\npolishing, but nevertheless it had an almost convincing expression\r\nabout it of having been just purchased new. The rest of his clothing was\r\nnapless and shiny, too, but it had the air of being entirely satisfied\r\nwith itself and blandly sorry for other people's clothes. It was growing\r\nrather dark in the house, and the evening air was chilly, too. Sellers\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLay off your overcoat, Washington, and draw up to the stove and make\r\nyourself at home--just consider yourself under your own shingles my\r\nboy--I'll have a fire going, in a jiffy. Light the lamp, Polly, dear,\r\nand let's have things cheerful--just as glad to see you, Washington, as\r\nif you'd been lost a century and we'd found you again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time the Colonel was conveying a lighted match into a poor\r\nlittle stove. Then he propped the stove door to its place by leaning the\r\npoker against it, for the hinges had retired from business. This door\r\nframed a small square of isinglass, which now warmed up with a faint\r\nglow. Mrs. Sellers lit a cheap, showy lamp, which dissipated a good deal\r\nof the gloom, and then everybody gathered into the light and took the\r\nstove into close companionship.\r\n\r\nThe children climbed all over Sellers, fondled him, petted him, and were\r\nlavishly petted in return. Out from this tugging, laughing, chattering\r\ndisguise of legs and arms and little faces, the Colonel's voice worked\r\nits way and his tireless tongue ran blithely on without interruption;\r\nand the purring little wife, diligent with her knitting, sat near at\r\nhand and looked happy and proud and grateful; and she listened as one\r\nwho listens to oracles and, gospels and whose grateful soul is being\r\nrefreshed with the bread of life. Bye and bye the children quieted down\r\nto listen; clustered about their father, and resting their elbows on his\r\nlegs, they hung upon his words as if he were uttering the music of the\r\nspheres.\r\n\r\nA dreary old hair-cloth sofa against the wall; a few damaged chairs;\r\nthe small table the lamp stood on; the crippled stove--these things\r\nconstituted the furniture of the room. There was no carpet on the floor;\r\non the wall were occasional square-shaped interruptions of the general\r\ntint of the plaster which betrayed that there used to be pictures in the\r\nhouse--but there were none now. There were no mantel ornaments, unless\r\none might bring himself to regard as an ornament a clock which never\r\ncame within fifteen strokes of striking the right time, and whose hands\r\nalways hitched together at twenty-two minutes past anything and traveled\r\nin company the rest of the way home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemarkable clock!\xe2\x80\x9d said Sellers, and got up and wound it. \xe2\x80\x9cI've been\r\noffered--well, I wouldn't expect you to believe what I've been offered\r\nfor that clock. Old Gov. Hager never sees me but he says, 'Come, now,\r\nColonel, name your price--I must have that clock!' But my goodness I'd\r\nas soon think of selling my wife. As I was saying to--silence in the\r\ncourt, now, she's begun to strike! You can't talk against her--you have\r\nto just be patient and hold up till she's said her say. Ah well, as I\r\nwas saying, when--she's beginning again! Nineteen, twenty, twenty-one,\r\ntwenty-two, twen----ah, that's all.--Yes, as I was saying to old\r\nJudge----go it, old girl, don't mind me.--Now how is that?----isn't that\r\na good, spirited tone? She can wake the dead! Sleep? Why you might as\r\nwell try to sleep in a thunder-factory. Now just listen at that. She'll\r\nstrike a hundred and fifty, now, without stopping,--you'll see. There\r\nain't another clock like that in Christendom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington hoped that this might be true, for the din was\r\ndistracting--though the family, one and all, seemed filled with joy; and\r\nthe more the clock \xe2\x80\x9cbuckled down to her work\xe2\x80\x9d as the Colonel expressed\r\nit, and the more insupportable the clatter became, the more enchanted\r\nthey all appeared to be. When there was silence, Mrs Sellers lifted upon\r\nWashington a face that beamed with a childlike pride, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt belonged to his grandmother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe look and the tone were a plain call for admiring surprise, and\r\ntherefore Washington said (it was the only thing that offered itself at\r\nthe moment:)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it did, didn't it father!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed one of the twins. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was my\r\ngreat-grandmother--and George's too; wasn't she, father! You never saw\r\nher, but Sis has seen her, when Sis was a baby-didn't you, Sis! Sis has\r\nseen her most a hundred times. She was awful deef--she's dead now. Ain't\r\nshe, father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the children chimed in, now, with one general Babel of information\r\nabout deceased--nobody offering to read the riot act or seeming to\r\ndiscountenance the insurrection or disapprove of it in any way--but the\r\nhead twin drowned all the turmoil and held his own against the field:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's our clock, now--and it's got wheels inside of it, and a thing that\r\nflutters every time she strikes--don't it, father! Great-grandmother\r\ndied before hardly any of us was born--she was an Old-School Baptist and\r\nhad warts all over her--you ask father if she didn't. She had an uncle\r\nonce that was bald-headed and used to have fits; he wasn't our uncle,\r\nI don't know what he was to us--some kin or another I reckon--father's\r\nseen him a thousand times--hain't you, father! We used to have a calf\r\nthat et apples and just chawed up dishrags like nothing, and if you\r\nstay here you'll see lots of funerals--won't he, Sis! Did you ever see a\r\nhouse afire? I have! Once me and Jim Terry----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Sellers began to speak now, and the storm ceased. He began to tell\r\nabout an enormous speculation he was thinking of embarking some capital\r\nin--a speculation which some London bankers had been over to consult\r\nwith him about--and soon he was building glittering pyramids of coin,\r\nand Washington was presently growing opulent under the magic of his\r\neloquence. But at the same time Washington was not able to ignore the\r\ncold entirely.\r\n\r\nHe was nearly as close to the stove as he could get, and yet he could\r\nnot persuade himself that he felt the slightest heat, notwithstanding\r\nthe isinglass' door was still gently and serenely glowing. He tried to\r\nget a trifle closer to the stove, and the consequence was, he tripped\r\nthe supporting poker and the stove-door tumbled to the floor. And then\r\nthere was a revelation--there was nothing in the stove but a lighted\r\ntallow-candle! The poor youth blushed and felt as if he must die\r\nwith shame. But the Colonel was only disconcerted for a moment--he\r\nstraightway found his voice again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little idea of my own, Washington--one of the greatest things in the\r\nworld! You must write and tell your father about it--don't forget that,\r\nnow. I have been reading up some European Scientific reports--friend of\r\nmine, Count Fugier, sent them to me--sends me all sorts of things from\r\nParis--he thinks the world of me, Fugier does. Well, I saw that the\r\nAcademy of France had been testing the properties of heat, and they came\r\nto the conclusion that it was a nonconductor or something like that,\r\nand of course its influence must necessarily be deadly in nervous\r\norganizations with excitable temperaments, especially where there is any\r\ntendency toward rheumatic affections. Bless you I saw in a moment what\r\nwas the matter with us, and says I, out goes your fires!--no more slow\r\ntorture and certain death for me, sir. What you want is the appearance\r\nof heat, not the heat itself--that's the idea. Well how to do it was the\r\nnext thing. I just put my head to work, pegged away a couple of days,\r\nand here you are! Rheumatism? Why a man can't any more start a case of\r\nrheumatism in this house than he can shake an opinion out of a mummy!\r\nStove with a candle in it and a transparent door--that's it--it has been\r\nthe salvation of this family. Don't you fail to write your father about\r\nit, Washington. And tell him the idea is mine--I'm no more conceited\r\nthan most people, I reckon, but you know it is human nature for a man to\r\nwant credit for a thing like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington said with his blue lips that he would, but he said in his\r\nsecret heart that he would promote no such iniquity. He tried to believe\r\nin the healthfulness of the invention, and succeeded tolerably well; but\r\nafter all he could not feel that good health in a frozen body was any\r\nreal improvement on the rheumatism.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n     --Whan pe horde is thynne, as of seruyse,\r\n     Nought replenesshed with grete diuersite\r\n     Of mete & drinke, good chere may then suffise\r\n     With honest talkyng---- The Book of Curtesye.\r\n\r\n     MAMMON. Come on, sir. Now, you set your foot on shore\r\n     In Novo Orbe; here's the rich Peru:\r\n     And there within, sir, are the golden mines,\r\n     Great Solomon's Ophir!----\r\n     B. Jonson\r\n\r\nThe supper at Col. Sellers's was not sumptuous, in the beginning, but it\r\nimproved on acquaintance. That is to say, that what Washington regarded\r\nat first sight as mere lowly potatoes, presently became awe-inspiring\r\nagricultural productions that had been reared in some ducal garden\r\nbeyond the sea, under the sacred eye of the duke himself, who had sent\r\nthem to Sellers; the bread was from corn which could be grown in only\r\none favored locality in the earth and only a favored few could get it;\r\nthe Rio coffee, which at first seemed execrable to the taste, took to\r\nitself an improved flavor when Washington was told to drink it slowly\r\nand not hurry what should be a lingering luxury in order to be fully\r\nappreciated--it was from the private stores of a Brazilian nobleman with\r\nan unrememberable name. The Colonel's tongue was a magician's wand that\r\nturned dried apples into figs and water into wine as easily as it could\r\nchange a hovel into a palace and present poverty into imminent future\r\nriches.\r\n\r\nWashington slept in a cold bed in a carpetless room and woke up in a\r\npalace in the morning; at least the palace lingered during the moment\r\nthat he was rubbing his eyes and getting his bearings--and then it\r\ndisappeared and he recognized that the Colonel's inspiring talk had been\r\ninfluencing his dreams. Fatigue had made him sleep late; when he entered\r\nthe sitting room he noticed that the old hair-cloth sofa was absent;\r\nwhen he sat down to breakfast the Colonel tossed six or seven dollars\r\nin bills on the table, counted them over, said he was a little short and\r\nmust call upon his banker; then returned the bills to his wallet with\r\nthe indifferent air of a man who is used to money. The breakfast was\r\nnot an improvement upon the supper, but the Colonel talked it up and\r\ntransformed it into an oriental feast. Bye and bye, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI intend to look out for you, Washington, my boy. I hunted up a place\r\nfor you yesterday, but I am not referring to that,--now--that is a mere\r\nlivelihood--mere bread and butter; but when I say I mean to look out for\r\nyou I mean something very different. I mean to put things in your way\r\nthan will make a mere livelihood a trifling thing. I'll put you in a\r\nway to make more money that you'll ever know what to do with. You'll be\r\nright here where I can put my hand on you when anything turns up. I've\r\ngot some prodigious operations on foot; but I'm keeping quiet; mum's the\r\nword; your old hand don't go around pow-wowing and letting everybody\r\nsee his k'yards and find out his little game. But all in good time,\r\nWashington, all in good time. You'll see. Now there's an operation in\r\ncorn that looks well. Some New York men are trying to get me to go into\r\nit--buy up all the growing crops and just boss the market when they\r\nmature--ah, I tell you it's a great thing. And it only costs a trifle;\r\ntwo millions or two and a half will do it. I haven't exactly promised\r\nyet--there's no hurry--the more indifferent I seem, you know, the\r\nmore anxious those fellows will get. And then there is the hog\r\nspeculation--that's bigger still. We've got quiet men at work,\xe2\x80\x9d [he was\r\nvery impressive here,] \xe2\x80\x9cmousing around, to get propositions out of all\r\nthe farmers in the whole west and northwest for the hog crop, and\r\nother agents quietly getting propositions and terms out of all the\r\nmanufactories--and don't you see, if we can get all the hogs and all the\r\nslaughter houses into our hands on the dead quiet--whew! it would take\r\nthree ships to carry the money.--I've looked into the thing--calculated\r\nall the chances for and all the chances against, and though I shake my\r\nhead and hesitate and keep on thinking, apparently, I've got my mind\r\nmade up that if the thing can be done on a capital of six millions,\r\nthat's the horse to put up money on! Why Washington--but what's the use\r\nof talking about it--any man can see that there's whole Atlantic oceans\r\nof cash in it, gulfs and bays thrown in. But there's a bigger thing than\r\nthat, yes bigger----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy Colonel, you can't want anything bigger!\xe2\x80\x9d said Washington, his eyes\r\nblazing. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I wish I could go into either of those speculations--I\r\nonly wish I had money--I wish I wasn't cramped and kept down and\r\nfettered with poverty, and such prodigious chances lying right here in\r\nsight! Oh, it is a fearful thing to be poor. But don't throw away those\r\nthings--they are so splendid and I can see how sure they are. Don't\r\nthrow them away for something still better and maybe fail in it! I\r\nwouldn't, Colonel. I would stick to these. I wish father were here and\r\nwere his old self again--Oh, he never in his life had such chances as\r\nthese are. Colonel; you can't improve on these--no man can improve on\r\nthem!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA sweet, compassionate smile played about the Colonel's features, and he\r\nleaned over the table with the air of a man who is \xe2\x80\x9cgoing to show you\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and do it without the least trouble:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy Washington, my boy, these things are nothing. They look large of\r\ncourse--they look large to a novice, but to a man who has been all his\r\nlife accustomed to large operations--shaw! They're well enough to while\r\naway an idle hour with, or furnish a bit of employment that will give\r\na trifle of idle capital a chance to earn its bread while it is waiting\r\nfor something to do, but--now just listen a moment--just let me give you\r\nan idea of what we old veterans of commerce call 'business.' Here's\r\nthe Rothschild's proposition--this is between you and me, you\r\nunderstand----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington nodded three or four times impatiently, and his glowing eyes\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes--hurry--I understand----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n----\xe2\x80\x9cfor I wouldn't have it get out for a fortune. They want me to go\r\nin with them on the sly--agent was here two weeks ago about it--go in\r\non the sly\xe2\x80\x9d [voice down to an impressive whisper, now,] \xe2\x80\x9cand buy up a\r\nhundred and thirteen wild cat banks in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky,\r\nIllinois and Missouri--notes of these banks are at all sorts of discount\r\nnow--average discount of the hundred and thirteen is forty-four per\r\ncent--buy them all up, you see, and then all of a sudden let the cat out\r\nof the bag! Whiz! the stock of every one of those wildcats would spin\r\nup to a tremendous premium before you could turn a handspring--profit\r\non the speculation not a dollar less than forty millions!\xe2\x80\x9d [An eloquent\r\npause, while the marvelous vision settled into W.'s focus.] \xe2\x80\x9cWhere's\r\nyour hogs now? Why my dear innocent boy, we would just sit down on the\r\nfront door-steps and peddle banks like lucifer matches!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington finally got his breath and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is perfectly wonderful! Why couldn't these things have happened\r\nin father's day? And I--it's of no use--they simply lie before my face\r\nand mock me. There is nothing for me but to stand helpless and see other\r\npeople reap the astonishing harvest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, Washington, don't you worry. I'll fix you. There's plenty\r\nof chances. How much money have you got?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the presence of so many millions, Washington could not keep from\r\nblushing when he had to confess that he had but eighteen dollars in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all right--don't despair. Other people have been obliged to begin\r\nwith less. I have a small idea that may develop into something for us\r\nboth, all in good time. Keep your money close and add to it. I'll make\r\nit breed. I've been experimenting (to pass away the time), on a little\r\npreparation for curing sore eyes--a kind of decoction nine-tenths water\r\nand the other tenth drugs that don't cost more than a dollar a barrel;\r\nI'm still experimenting; there's one ingredient wanted yet to perfect\r\nthe thing, and somehow I can't just manage to hit upon the thing that's\r\nnecessary, and I don't dare talk with a chemist, of course. But I'm\r\nprogressing, and before many weeks I wager the country will ring with\r\nthe fame of Beriah Sellers' Infallible Imperial Oriental Optic Liniment\r\nand Salvation for Sore Eyes--the Medical Wonder of the Age! Small\r\nbottles fifty cents, large ones a dollar. Average cost, five and seven\r\ncents for the two sizes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first year sell, say, ten thousand bottles in Missouri, seven\r\nthousand in Iowa, three thousand in Arkansas, four thousand in Kentucky,\r\nsix thousand in Illinois, and say twenty-five thousand in the rest of\r\nthe country. Total, fifty five thousand bottles; profit clear of all\r\nexpenses, twenty thousand dollars at the very lowest calculation. All\r\nthe capital needed is to manufacture the first two thousand bottles--say\r\na hundred and fifty dollars--then the money would begin to flow in.\r\nThe second year, sales would reach 200,000 bottles--clear profit, say,\r\n$75,000--and in the meantime the great factory would be building in\r\nSt. Louis, to cost, say, $100,000. The third year we could easily sell\r\n1,000,000 bottles in the United States and----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d said Washington. \xe2\x80\x9cLet's commence right away--let's----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c----1,000,000 bottles in the United States--profit at least\r\n$350,000--and then it would begin to be time to turn our attention\r\ntoward the real idea of the business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe real idea of it! Ain't $350,000 a year a pretty real----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStuff! Why what an infant you are, Washington--what a guileless,\r\nshort-sighted, easily-contented innocent you are, my poor little\r\ncountry-bred know-nothing! Would I go to all that trouble and bother for\r\nthe poor crumbs a body might pick up in this country? Now do I look\r\nlike a man who----does my history suggest that I am a man who deals\r\nin trifles, contents himself with the narrow horizon that hems in the\r\ncommon herd, sees no further than the end of his nose? Now you know that\r\nthat is not me--couldn't be me. You ought to know that if I throw my\r\ntime and abilities into a patent medicine, it's a patent medicine whose\r\nfield of operations is the solid earth! its clients the swarming nations\r\nthat inhabit it! Why what is the republic of America for an eye-water\r\ncountry? Lord bless you, it is nothing but a barren highway that you've\r\ngot to cross to get to the true eye-water market! Why, Washington, in\r\nthe Oriental countries people swarm like the sands of the desert; every\r\nsquare mile of ground upholds its thousands upon thousands of struggling\r\nhuman creatures--and every separate and individual devil of them's got\r\nthe ophthalmia! It's as natural to them as noses are--and sin. It's born\r\nwith them, it stays with them, it's all that some of them have left when\r\nthey die. Three years of introductory trade in the orient and what will\r\nbe the result? Why, our headquarters would be in Constantinople and\r\nour hindquarters in Further India! Factories and warehouses in Cairo,\r\nIspahan, Bagdad, Damascus, Jerusalem, Yedo, Peking, Bangkok, Delhi,\r\nBombay--and Calcutta! Annual income--well, God only knows how many\r\nmillions and millions apiece!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington was so dazed, so bewildered--his heart and his eyes had\r\nwandered so far away among the strange lands beyond the seas, and such\r\navalanches of coin and currency had fluttered and jingled confusedly\r\ndown before him, that he was now as one who has been whirling round\r\nand round for a time, and, stopping all at once, finds his surroundings\r\nstill whirling and all objects a dancing chaos. However, little by\r\nlittle the Sellers family cooled down and crystalized into shape, and\r\nthe poor room lost its glitter and resumed its poverty. Then the youth\r\nfound his voice and begged Sellers to drop everything and hurry up the\r\neye-water; and he got his eighteen dollars and tried to force it upon\r\nthe Colonel--pleaded with him to take it--implored him to do it. But\r\nthe Colonel would not; said he would not need the capital (in his\r\nnative magnificent way he called that eighteen dollars Capital) till the\r\neye-water was an accomplished fact. He made Washington easy in his\r\nmind, though, by promising that he would call for it just as soon as the\r\ninvention was finished, and he added the glad tidings that nobody but\r\njust they two should be admitted to a share in the speculation.\r\n\r\nWhen Washington left the breakfast table he could have worshiped that\r\nman. Washington was one of that kind of people whose hopes are in the\r\nvery clouds one day and in the gutter the next. He walked on air now.\r\nThe Colonel was ready to take him around and introduce him to the\r\nemployment he had found for him, but Washington begged for a few moments\r\nin which to write home; with his kind of people, to ride to-day's new\r\ninterest to death and put off yesterday's till another time, is nature\r\nitself. He ran up stairs and wrote glowingly, enthusiastically, to his\r\nmother about the hogs and the corn, the banks and the eye-water--and\r\nadded a few inconsequential millions to each project. And he said that\r\npeople little dreamed what a man Col. Sellers was, and that the world\r\nwould open its eyes when it found out. And he closed his letter thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo make yourself perfectly easy, mother-in a little while you shall\r\nhave everything you want, and more. I am not likely to stint you in\r\nanything, I fancy. This money will not be for me, alone, but for all\r\nof us. I want all to share alike; and there is going to be far more\r\nfor each than one person can spend. Break it to father cautiously--you\r\nunderstand the need of that--break it to him cautiously, for he has had\r\nsuch cruel hard fortune, and is so stricken by it that great good news\r\nmight prostrate him more surely than even bad, for he is used to the bad\r\nbut is grown sadly unaccustomed to the other. Tell Laura--tell all the\r\nchildren. And write to Clay about it if he is not with you yet. You may\r\ntell Clay that whatever I get he can freely share in-freely. He knows\r\nthat that is true--there will be no need that I should swear to that to\r\nmake him believe it. Good-bye--and mind what I say: Rest perfectly easy,\r\none and all of you, for our troubles are nearly at an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor lad, he could not know that his mother would cry some loving,\r\ncompassionate tears over his letter and put off the family with a\r\nsynopsis of its contents which conveyed a deal of love to them but not\r\nmuch idea of his prospects or projects. And he never dreamed that such\r\na joyful letter could sadden her and fill her night with sighs, and\r\ntroubled thoughts, and bodings of the future, instead of filling it with\r\npeace and blessing it with restful sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen the letter was done, Washington and the Colonel sallied forth, and\r\nas they walked along Washington learned what he was to be. He was to\r\nbe a clerk in a real estate office. Instantly the fickle youth's dreams\r\nforsook the magic eye-water and flew back to the Tennessee Land. And the\r\ngorgeous possibilities of that great domain straightway began to occupy\r\nhis imagination to such a degree that he could scarcely manage to keep\r\neven enough of his attention upon the Colonel's talk to retain the\r\ngeneral run of what he was saying. He was glad it was a real estate\r\noffice--he was a made man now, sure.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel said that General Boswell was a rich man and had a good and\r\ngrowing business; and that Washington's work would be light and he would\r\nget forty dollars a month and be boarded and lodged in the General's\r\nfamily--which was as good as ten dollars more; and even better, for he\r\ncould not live as well even at the \xe2\x80\x9cCity Hotel\xe2\x80\x9d as he would there, and\r\nyet the hotel charged fifteen dollars a month where a man had a good\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nGeneral Boswell was in his office; a comfortable looking place, with\r\nplenty of outline maps hanging about the walls and in the windows, and\r\na spectacled man was marking out another one on a long table. The office\r\nwas in the principal street. The General received Washington with a\r\nkindly but reserved politeness. Washington rather liked his looks. He\r\nwas about fifty years old, dignified, well preserved and well dressed.\r\nAfter the Colonel took his leave, the General talked a while with\r\nWashington--his talk consisting chiefly of instructions about the\r\nclerical duties of the place. He seemed satisfied as to Washington's\r\nability to take care of the books, he was evidently a pretty fair\r\ntheoretical bookkeeper, and experience would soon harden theory\r\ninto practice. By and by dinner-time came, and the two walked to the\r\nGeneral's house; and now Washington noticed an instinct in himself that\r\nmoved him to keep not in the General's rear, exactly, but yet not at his\r\nside--somehow the old gentleman's dignity and reserve did not inspire\r\nfamiliarity.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nWashington dreamed his way along the street, his fancy flitting from\r\ngrain to hogs, from hogs to banks, from banks to eye-water, from\r\neye-water to Tennessee Land, and lingering but a feverish moment upon\r\neach of these fascinations. He was conscious of but one outward thing,\r\nto wit, the General, and he was really not vividly conscious of him.\r\n\r\nArrived at the finest dwelling in the town, they entered it and were at\r\nhome. Washington was introduced to Mrs. Boswell, and his imagination was\r\non the point of flitting into the vapory realms of speculation again,\r\nwhen a lovely girl of sixteen or seventeen came in. This vision swept\r\nWashington's mind clear of its chaos of glittering rubbish in an\r\ninstant. Beauty had fascinated him before; many times he had been in\r\nlove even for weeks at a time with the same object but his heart had\r\nnever suffered so sudden and so fierce an assault as this, within his\r\nrecollection.\r\n\r\nLouise Boswell occupied his mind and drifted among his multiplication\r\ntables all the afternoon. He was constantly catching himself in a\r\nreverie--reveries made up of recalling how she looked when she first\r\nburst upon him; how her voice thrilled him when she first spoke; how\r\ncharmed the very air seemed by her presence. Blissful as the afternoon\r\nwas, delivered up to such a revel as this, it seemed an eternity,\r\nso impatient was he to see the girl again. Other afternoons like it\r\nfollowed. Washington plunged into this love affair as he plunged into\r\neverything else--upon impulse and without reflection. As the days\r\nwent by it seemed plain that he was growing in favor with Louise,--not\r\nsweepingly so, but yet perceptibly, he fancied. His attentions to her\r\ntroubled her father and mother a little, and they warned Louise, without\r\nstating particulars or making allusions to any special person, that a\r\ngirl was sure to make a mistake who allowed herself to marry anybody but\r\na man who could support her well.\r\n\r\nSome instinct taught Washington that his present lack of money would be\r\nan obstruction, though possibly not a bar, to his hopes, and straightway\r\nhis poverty became a torture to him which cast all his former sufferings\r\nunder that held into the shade. He longed for riches now as he had never\r\nlonged for them before.\r\n\r\nHe had been once or twice to dine with Col. Sellers, and had been\r\ndiscouraged to note that the Colonel's bill of fare was falling off both\r\nin quantity and quality--a sign, he feared, that the lacking ingredient\r\nin the eye-water still remained undiscovered--though Sellers always\r\nexplained that these changes in the family diet had been ordered by\r\nthe doctor, or suggested by some new scientific work the Colonel had\r\nstumbled upon. But it always turned out that the lacking ingredient was\r\nstill lacking--though it always appeared, at the same time, that the\r\nColonel was right on its heels.\r\n\r\nEvery time the Colonel came into the real estate office Washington's\r\nheart bounded and his eyes lighted with hope, but it always turned out\r\nthat the Colonel was merely on the scent of some vast, undefined landed\r\nspeculation--although he was customarily able to say that he was nearer\r\nto the all-necessary ingredient than ever, and could almost name the\r\nhour when success would dawn. And then Washington's heart would sink\r\nagain and a sigh would tell when it touched bottom.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a letter came, saying that Judge Hawkins had been ailing\r\nfor a fortnight, and was now considered to be seriously ill. It was\r\nthought best that Washington should come home. The news filled him with\r\ngrief, for he loved and honored his father; the Boswells were touched\r\nby the youth's sorrow, and even the General unbent and said encouraging\r\nthings to him.--There was balm in this; but when Louise bade him\r\ngood-bye, and shook his hand and said, \xe2\x80\x9cDon't be cast down--it will all\r\ncome out right--I know it will all come out right,\xe2\x80\x9d it seemed a blessed\r\nthing to be in misfortune, and the tears that welled up to his eyes were\r\nthe messengers of an adoring and a grateful heart; and when the girl saw\r\nthem and answering tears came into her own eyes, Washington could hardly\r\ncontain the excess of happiness that poured into the cavities of his\r\nbreast that were so lately stored to the roof with grief.\r\n\r\nAll the way home he nursed his woe and exalted it. He pictured\r\nhimself as she must be picturing him: a noble, struggling young spirit\r\npersecuted by misfortune, but bravely and patiently waiting in the\r\nshadow of a dread calamity and preparing to meet the blow as became\r\none who was all too used to hard fortune and the pitiless buffetings of\r\nfate. These thoughts made him weep, and weep more broken-heartedly than\r\never; and he wished that she could see his sufferings now.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing significant in the fact that Louise, dreamy and\r\ndistraught, stood at her bedroom bureau that night, scribbling\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWashington\xe2\x80\x9d here and there over a sheet of paper. But there was\r\nsomething significant in the fact that she scratched the word out every\r\ntime she wrote it; examined the erasure critically to see if anybody\r\ncould guess at what the word had been; then buried it under a maze of\r\nobliterating lines; and finally, as if still unsatisfied, burned the\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nWhen Washington reached home, he recognized at once how serious\r\nhis father's case was. The darkened room, the labored breathing and\r\noccasional moanings of the patient, the tip-toeing of the attendants and\r\ntheir whispered consultations, were full of sad meaning. For three or\r\nfour nights Mrs. Hawkins and Laura had been watching by the bedside;\r\nClay had arrived, preceding Washington by one day, and he was now added\r\nto the corps of watchers. Mr. Hawkins would have none but these three,\r\nthough neighborly assistance was offered by old friends. From this time\r\nforth three-hour watches were instituted, and day and night the watchers\r\nkept their vigils. By degrees Laura and her mother began to show wear,\r\nbut neither of them would yield a minute of their tasks to Clay. He\r\nventured once to let the midnight hour pass without calling Laura, but\r\nhe ventured no more; there was that about her rebuke when he tried\r\nto explain, that taught him that to let her sleep when she might be\r\nministering to her father's needs, was to rob her of moments that were\r\npriceless in her eyes; he perceived that she regarded it as a privilege\r\nto watch, not a burden. And, he had noticed, also, that when midnight\r\nstruck, the patient turned his eyes toward the door, with an expectancy\r\nin them which presently grew into a longing but brightened into\r\ncontentment as soon as the door opened and Laura appeared. And he did\r\nnot need Laura's rebuke when he heard his father say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClay is good, and you are tired, poor child; but I wanted you so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClay is not good, father--he did not call me. I would not have treated\r\nhim so. How could you do it, Clay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClay begged forgiveness and promised not to break faith again; and as\r\nhe betook him to his bed, he said to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cIt's a steadfast little\r\nsoul; whoever thinks he is doing the Duchess a kindness by intimating\r\nthat she is not sufficient for any undertaking she puts her hand to,\r\nmakes a mistake; and if I did not know it before, I know now that there\r\nare surer ways of pleasing her than by trying to lighten her labor when\r\nthat labor consists in wearing herself out for the sake of a person she\r\nloves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA week drifted by, and all the while the patient sank lower and lower.\r\nThe night drew on that was to end all suspense. It was a wintry one.\r\nThe darkness gathered, the snow was falling, the wind wailed plaintively\r\nabout the house or shook it with fitful gusts. The doctor had paid his\r\nlast visit and gone away with that dismal remark to the nearest friend\r\nof the family that he \xe2\x80\x9cbelieved there was nothing more that he could\r\ndo\xe2\x80\x9d--a remark which is always overheard by some one it is not meant for\r\nand strikes a lingering half-conscious hope dead with a withering shock;\r\nthe medicine phials had been removed from the bedside and put out of\r\nsight, and all things made orderly and meet for the solemn event that\r\nwas impending; the patient, with closed eyes, lay scarcely breathing;\r\nthe watchers sat by and wiped the gathering damps from his forehead\r\nwhile the silent tears flowed down their faces; the deep hush was only\r\ninterrupted by sobs from the children, grouped about the bed.\r\n\r\nAfter a time--it was toward midnight now--Mr. Hawkins roused out of\r\na doze, looked about him and was evidently trying to speak. Instantly\r\nLaura lifted his head and in a failing voice he said, while something of\r\nthe old light shone in his eyes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWife--children--come nearer--nearer. The darkness grows. Let me see you\r\nall, once more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe group closed together at the bedside, and their tears and sobs came\r\nnow without restraint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am leaving you in cruel poverty. I have been--so foolish--so\r\nshort-sighted. But courage! A better day is--is coming. Never lose\r\nsight of the Tennessee Land! Be wary. There is wealth stored up for you\r\nthere--wealth that is boundless! The children shall hold up their heads\r\nwith the best in the land, yet. Where are the papers?--Have you got the\r\npapers safe? Show them--show them to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnder his strong excitement his voice had gathered power and his last\r\nsentences were spoken with scarcely a perceptible halt or hindrance.\r\nWith an effort he had raised himself almost without assistance to a\r\nsitting posture. But now the fire faded out of his eyes and he fell\r\nback exhausted. The papers were brought and held before him, and\r\nthe answering smile that flitted across his face showed that he was\r\nsatisfied. He closed his eyes, and the signs of approaching dissolution\r\nmultiplied rapidly. He lay almost motionless for a little while, then\r\nsuddenly partly raised his head and looked about him as one who peers\r\ninto a dim uncertain light. He muttered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone? No--I see you--still. It is--it is-over. But you are--safe. Safe.\r\nThe Ten-----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voice died out in a whisper; the sentence was never finished. The\r\nemaciated fingers began to pick at the coverlet, a fatal sign. After a\r\ntime there were no sounds but the cries of the mourners within and the\r\ngusty turmoil of the wind without. Laura had bent down and kissed her\r\nfather's lips as the spirit left the body; but she did not sob, or utter\r\nany ejaculation; her tears flowed silently. Then she closed the dead\r\neyes, and crossed the hands upon the breast; after a season, she kissed\r\nthe forehead reverently, drew the sheet up over the face, and then\r\nwalked apart and sat down with the look of one who is done with life\r\nand has no further interest in its joys and sorrows, its hopes or its\r\nambitions. Clay buried his face in the coverlet of the bed; when the\r\nother children and the mother realized that death was indeed come at\r\nlast, they threw themselves into each others' arms and gave way to a\r\nfrenzy of grief.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X Laura Hawkins Discovers a Mystery in Her Parentage and Grows\r\nMorbid Under the Village Gossip\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI A Dinner with Col Sellers--Wonderful Effects of Raw Turnips\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII Philip Sterling and Henry Brierly--Arrangements to Go West\r\nas Engineers\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII Rail--Road Contractors and Party Traveling--Philip and\r\nHarry form the Acquaintance of Col Sellers\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV Ruth Bolton and Her Parents\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV Visitors of the Boltons--Mr Bigler \xe2\x80\x9cSees the\r\nLegislature\xe2\x80\x9d--Ruth Bolton Commences Medical Studies\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI The Engineers Detained at St Louis--Off for Camp--Reception\r\nby Jeff\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII The Engineer Corps Arrive at Stone's Landing\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII Laura and Her Marriage to Colonel Selby--Deserted and\r\nReturns to Hawkeye\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n37.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0LAURA SEEKING POR EVIDENCES OF HER BIRTH 38.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EVER TRUE 39.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A\r\nHEALTHY MEAL 40.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0PHILIP AT THE THEATRE 41.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0WHAT PHILIP LEARNED\r\nAT COLLEGE 42.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0THE DELEGATE'S INTERESTING GAME 43.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0THE PERSON OF\r\nIMPORTANCE 44.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cNOT THAT\xe2\x80\x9d 45.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0RUTH'S MOTHER MAKES ENQUIRIES 46.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0THE\r\nLETTER 47.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0CARING FOR THE POOR 48.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ANATOMICAL INVESTIGATIONS 49.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0RUTH\r\nLOOKING AT THE \xe2\x80\x9cNEW ONE\xe2\x80\x9d BY CANDLE LIGHT 60.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cONLY FOR YOU, BRIERLY\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n 51.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AN ACCLIMATED MAN 51.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0NO THANKS!

He had been\r\nuniversally trusted and honored in his day, but had finally, fallen into\r\nmisfortune; while serving his third term in Congress, and while upon the\r\npoint of being elevated to the Senate--which was considered the summit\r\nof earthly aggrandizement in those days--he had yielded to temptation,\r\nwhen in distress for money wherewith to save his estate; and sold his\r\nvote. His crime was discovered, and his fall followed instantly. Nothing\r\ncould reinstate him in the confidence of the people, his ruin was\r\nirretrievable--his disgrace complete. All doors were closed against him,\r\nall men avoided him. After years of skulking retirement and dissipation,\r\ndeath had relieved him of his troubles at last, and his funeral followed\r\nclose upon that of Mr. Hawkins. He died as he had latterly lived--wholly\r\nalone and friendless. He had no relatives--or if he had they did not\r\nacknowledge him. The coroner's jury found certain memoranda upon his\r\nbody and about the premises which revealed a fact not suspected by the\r\nvillagers before-viz., that Laura was not the child of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nHawkins.\r\n\r\nThe gossips were soon at work. They were but little hampered by the\r\nfact that the memoranda referred to betrayed nothing but the bare\r\ncircumstance that Laura's real parents were unknown, and stopped there.\r\nSo far from being hampered by this, the gossips seemed to gain all\r\nthe more freedom from it. They supplied all the missing information\r\nthemselves, they filled up all the blanks. The town soon teemed\r\nwith histories of Laura's origin and secret history, no two versions\r\nprecisely alike, but all elaborate, exhaustive, mysterious and\r\ninteresting, and all agreeing in one vital particular--to-wit, that\r\nthere was a suspicious cloud about her birth, not to say a disreputable\r\none.\r\n\r\nLaura began to encounter cold looks, averted eyes and peculiar nods and\r\ngestures which perplexed her beyond measure; but presently the pervading\r\ngossip found its way to her, and she understood them--then. Her pride\r\nwas stung. She was astonished, and at first incredulous. She was about\r\nto ask her mother if there was any truth in these reports, but upon\r\nsecond thought held her peace. She soon gathered that Major Lackland's\r\nmemoranda seemed to refer to letters which had passed between himself\r\nand Judge Hawkins. She shaped her course without difficulty the day that\r\nthat hint reached her.\r\n\r\nThat night she sat in her room till all was still, and then she stole\r\ninto the garret and began a search. She rummaged long among boxes of\r\nmusty papers relating to business matters of no interest to her, but\r\nat last she found several bundles of letters. One bundle was marked\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cprivate,\xe2\x80\x9d and in that she found what she wanted. She selected six\r\nor eight letters from the package and began to devour their contents,\r\nheedless of the cold.\r\n\r\nBy the dates, these letters were from five to seven years old. They were\r\nall from Major Lackland to Mr. Hawkins. The substance of them was, that\r\nsome one in the east had been inquiring of Major Lackland about a lost\r\nchild and its parents, and that it was conjectured that the child might\r\nbe Laura.\r\n\r\nEvidently some of the letters were missing, for the name of the\r\ninquirer was not mentioned; there was a casual reference to \xe2\x80\x9cthis\r\nhandsome-featured aristocratic gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d as if the reader and the\r\nwriter were accustomed to speak of him and knew who was meant.\r\n\r\nIn one letter the Major said he agreed with Mr. Hawkins that the\r\ninquirer seemed not altogether on the wrong track; but he also agreed\r\nthat it would be best to keep quiet until more convincing developments\r\nwere forthcoming.\r\n\r\nAnother letter said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe poor soul broke completely down when he\r\nsaw Laura's picture, and declared it must be she.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill another said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seems entirely alone in the world, and his heart is so wrapped up in\r\nthis thing that I believe that if it proved a false hope, it would kill\r\nhim; I have persuaded him to wait a little while and go west when I go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Another letter had this paragraph in it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is better one day and worse the next, and is out of his mind a good\r\ndeal of the time. Lately his case has developed a something which is a\r\nwonder to the hired nurses, but which will not be much of a marvel\r\nto you if you have read medical philosophy much. It is this: his lost\r\nmemory returns to him when he is delirious, and goes away again when he\r\nis himself-just as old Canada Joe used to talk the French patois of his\r\nboyhood in the delirium of typhus fever, though he could not do it when\r\nhis mind was clear. Now this poor gentleman's memory has always broken\r\ndown before he reached the explosion of the steamer; he could only\r\nremember starting up the river with his wife and child, and he had an\r\nidea that there was a race, but he was not certain; he could not name\r\nthe boat he was on; there was a dead blank of a month or more that\r\nsupplied not an item to his recollection. It was not for me to assist\r\nhim, of course. But now in his delirium it all comes out: the names of\r\nthe boats, every incident of the explosion, and likewise the details of\r\nhis astonishing escape--that is, up to where, just as a yawl-boat was\r\napproaching him (he was clinging to the starboard wheel of the burning\r\nwreck at the time), a falling timber struck him on the head. But I will\r\nwrite out his wonderful escape in full to-morrow or next day. Of course\r\nthe physicians will not let me tell him now that our Laura is indeed his\r\nchild--that must come later, when his health is thoroughly restored. His\r\ncase is not considered dangerous at all; he will recover presently, the\r\ndoctors say. But they insist that he must travel a little when he\r\ngets well--they recommend a short sea voyage, and they say he can be\r\npersuaded to try it if we continue to keep him in ignorance and promise\r\nto let him see L. as soon as he returns.\xe2\x80\x9d The letter that bore the\r\nlatest date of all, contained this clause:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the most unaccountable thing in the world; the mystery remains as\r\nimpenetrable as ever; I have hunted high and low for him, and inquired\r\nof everybody, but in vain; all trace of him ends at that hotel in New\r\nYork; I never have seen or heard of him since, up to this day; he could\r\nhardly have sailed, for his name does not appear upon the books of any\r\nshipping office in New York or Boston or Baltimore. How fortunate it\r\nseems, now, that we kept this thing to ourselves; Laura still has a\r\nfather in you, and it is better for her that we drop this subject here\r\nforever.\xe2\x80\x9d That was all. Random remarks here and there, being pieced\r\ntogether gave Laura a vague impression of a man of fine presence, about\r\nforty-three or forty-five years of age, with dark hair and eyes, and a\r\nslight limp in his walk--it was not stated which leg was defective. And\r\nthis indistinct shadow represented her father. She made an exhaustive\r\nsearch for the missing letters, but found none. They had probably been\r\nburned; and she doubted not that the ones she had ferreted out would\r\nhave shared the same fate if Mr. Hawkins had not been a dreamer, void\r\nof method, whose mind was perhaps in a state of conflagration over some\r\nbright new speculation when he received them.\r\n\r\nShe sat long, with the letters in her lap, thinking--and unconsciously\r\nfreezing. She felt like a lost person who has traveled down a long\r\nlane in good hope of escape, and, just as the night descends finds his\r\nprogress barred by a bridge-less river whose further shore, if it has\r\none, is lost in the darkness. If she could only have found these letters\r\na month sooner! That was her thought. But now the dead had carried\r\ntheir secrets with them. A dreary, melancholy settled down upon her. An\r\nundefined sense of injury crept into her heart. She grew very miserable.\r\n\r\nShe had just reached the romantic age--the age when there is a sad\r\nsweetness, a dismal comfort to a girl to find out that there is a\r\nmystery connected with her birth, which no other piece of good luck can\r\nafford. She had more than her rightful share of practical good sense,\r\nbut still she was human; and to be human is to have one's little modicum\r\nof romance secreted away in one's composition. One never ceases to make\r\na hero of one's self, (in private,) during life, but only alters the\r\nstyle of his heroism from time to time as the drifting years belittle\r\ncertain gods of his admiration and raise up others in their stead that\r\nseem greater.\r\n\r\nThe recent wearing days and nights of watching, and the wasting grief\r\nthat had possessed her, combined with the profound depression that\r\nnaturally came with the reaction of idleness, made Laura peculiarly\r\nsusceptible at this time to romantic impressions. She was a heroine,\r\nnow, with a mysterious father somewhere. She could not really tell\r\nwhether she wanted to find him and spoil it all or not; but still all\r\nthe traditions of romance pointed to the making the attempt as the usual\r\nand necessary course to follow; therefore she would some day begin the\r\nsearch when opportunity should offer.\r\n\r\nNow a former thought struck her--she would speak to Mrs. Hawkins. And\r\nnaturally enough Mrs. Hawkins appeared on the stage at that moment.\r\n\r\nShe said she knew all--she knew that Laura had discovered the secret\r\nthat Mr. Hawkins, the elder children, Col. Sellers and herself had kept\r\nso long and so faithfully; and she cried and said that now that troubles\r\nhad begun they would never end; her daughter's love would wean itself\r\naway from her and her heart would break. Her grief so wrought upon\r\nLaura that the girl almost forgot her own troubles for the moment in her\r\ncompassion for her mother's distress. Finally Mrs. Hawkins said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to me, child--do not forsake me. Forget all this miserable talk.\r\nSay I am your mother!--I have loved you so long, and there is no other.\r\nI am your mother, in the sight of God, and nothing shall ever take you\r\nfrom me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll barriers fell, before this appeal. Laura put her arms about her\r\nmother's neck and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are my mother, and always shall be. We will be as we have always\r\nbeen; and neither this foolish talk nor any other thing shall part us or\r\nmake us less to each other than we are this hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no longer any sense of separation or estrangement between\r\nthem. Indeed their love seemed more perfect now than it had ever been\r\nbefore. By and by they went down stairs and sat by the fire and talked\r\nlong and earnestly about Laura's history and the letters. But it\r\ntranspired that Mrs. Hawkins had never known of this correspondence\r\nbetween her husband and Major Lackland. With his usual consideration for\r\nhis wife, Mr. Hawkins had shielded her from the worry the matter would\r\nhave caused her.\r\n\r\nLaura went to bed at last with a mind that had gained largely in\r\ntranquility and had lost correspondingly in morbid romantic exaltation.\r\nShe was pensive, the next day, and subdued; but that was not matter for\r\nremark, for she did not differ from the mournful friends about her in\r\nthat respect. Clay and Washington were the same loving and admiring\r\nbrothers now that they had always been. The great secret was new to some\r\nof the younger children, but their love suffered no change under the\r\nwonderful revelation.\r\n\r\nIt is barely possible that things might have presently settled down\r\ninto their old rut and the mystery have lost the bulk of its romantic\r\nsublimity in Laura's eyes, if the village gossips could have quieted\r\ndown. But they could not quiet down and they did not. Day after day\r\nthey called at the house, ostensibly upon visits of condolence, and they\r\npumped away at the mother and the children without seeming to know\r\nthat their questionings were in bad taste. They meant no harm they only\r\nwanted to know. Villagers always want to know.\r\n\r\nThe family fought shy of the questionings, and of course that was high\r\ntestimony \xe2\x80\x9cif the Duchess was respectably born, why didn't they come out\r\nand prove it?--why did they, stick to that poor thin story about picking\r\nher up out of a steamboat explosion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnder this ceaseless persecution, Laura's morbid self-communing was\r\nrenewed. At night the day's contribution of detraction, innuendo and\r\nmalicious conjecture would be canvassed in her mind, and then she would\r\ndrift into a course of thinking. As her thoughts ran on, the indignant\r\ntears would spring to her eyes, and she would spit out fierce little\r\nejaculations at intervals. But finally she would grow calmer and say\r\nsome comforting disdainful thing--something like this:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who are they?--Animals! What are their opinions to me? Let\r\nthem talk--I will not stoop to be affected by it. I could hate----.\r\nNonsense--nobody I care for or in any way respect is changed toward me,\r\nI fancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe may have supposed she was thinking of many individuals, but it was\r\nnot so--she was thinking of only one. And her heart warmed somewhat,\r\ntoo, the while. One day a friend overheard a conversation like\r\nthis:--and naturally came and told her all about it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNed, they say you don't go there any more. How is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don't; but I tell you it's not because I don't want to and\r\nit's not because I think it is any matter who her father was or who he\r\nwasn't, either; it's only on account of this talk, talk, talk. I think\r\nshe is a fine girl every way, and so would you if you knew her as well\r\nas I do; but you know how it is when a girl once gets talked about--it's\r\nall up with her--the world won't ever let her alone, after that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe only comment Laura made upon this revelation, was:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it appears that if this trouble had not occurred I could have\r\nhad the happiness of Mr. Ned Thurston's serious attentions. He is well\r\nfavored in person, and well liked, too, I believe, and comes of one of\r\nthe first families of the village. He is prosperous, too, I hear; has\r\nbeen a doctor a year, now, and has had two patients--no, three, I think;\r\nyes, it was three. I attended their funerals. Well, other people have\r\nhoped and been disappointed; I am not alone in that. I wish you could\r\nstay to dinner, Maria--we are going to have sausages; and besides, I\r\nwanted to talk to you about Hawkeye and make you promise to come and see\r\nus when we are settled there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Maria could not stay. She had come to mingle romantic tears with\r\nLaura's over the lover's defection and had found herself dealing with a\r\nheart that could not rise to an appreciation of affliction because its\r\ninterest was all centred in sausages.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as Maria was gone, Laura stamped her expressive foot and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe coward! Are all books lies? I thought he would fly to the front,\r\nand be brave and noble, and stand up for me against all the world, and\r\ndefy my enemies, and wither these gossips with his scorn! Poor crawling\r\nthing, let him go. I do begin to despise this world!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe lapsed into thought. Presently she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the time ever comes, and I get a chance, Oh, I'll----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe could not find a word that was strong enough, perhaps. By and by she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am glad of it--I'm glad of it. I never cared anything for him\r\nanyway!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then, with small consistency, she cried a little, and patted her\r\nfoot more indignantly than ever.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTwo months had gone by and the Hawkins family were domiciled in\r\nHawkeye. Washington was at work in the real estate office again, and\r\nwas alternately in paradise or the other place just as it happened\r\nthat Louise was gracious to him or seemingly indifferent--because\r\nindifference or preoccupation could mean nothing else than that she was\r\nthinking of some other young person. Col. Sellers had asked him\r\nseveral times, to dine with him, when he first returned to Hawkeye, but\r\nWashington, for no particular reason, had not accepted. No particular\r\nreason except one which he preferred to keep to himself--viz. that he\r\ncould not bear to be away from Louise. It occurred to him, now, that the\r\nColonel had not invited him lately--could he be offended? He resolved\r\nto go that very day, and give the Colonel a pleasant surprise. It was a\r\ngood idea; especially as Louise had absented herself from breakfast that\r\nmorning, and torn his heart; he would tear hers, now, and let her see\r\nhow it felt.\r\n\r\nThe Sellers family were just starting to dinner when Washington\r\nburst upon them with his surprise. For an instant the Colonel looked\r\nnonplussed, and just a bit uncomfortable; and Mrs. Sellers looked\r\nactually distressed; but the next moment the head of the house was\r\nhimself again, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, my boy, all right--always glad to see you--always glad\r\nto hear your voice and take you by the hand. Don't wait for special\r\ninvitations--that's all nonsense among friends. Just come whenever you\r\ncan, and come as often as you can--the oftener the better. You can't\r\nplease us any better than that, Washington; the little woman will tell\r\nyou so herself. We don't pretend to style. Plain folks, you know--plain\r\nfolks. Just a plain family dinner, but such as it is, our friends are\r\nalways welcome, I reckon you know that yourself, Washington. Run along,\r\nchildren, run along; Lafayette,--[**In those old days the average man\r\ncalled his children after his most revered literary and historical\r\nidols; consequently there was hardly a family, at least in the West,\r\nbut had a Washington in it--and also a Lafayette, a Franklin, and six or\r\neight sounding names from Byron, Scott, and the Bible, if the offspring\r\nheld out. To visit such a family, was to find one's self confronted by\r\na congress made up of representatives of the imperial myths and the\r\nmajestic dead of all the ages. There was something thrilling about it,\r\nto a stranger, not to say awe inspiring.]--stand off the cat's tail,\r\nchild, can't you see what you're doing?--Come, come, come, Roderick\r\nDhu, it isn't nice for little boys to hang onto young gentlemen's coat\r\ntails--but never mind him, Washington, he's full of spirits and don't\r\nmean any harm. Children will be children, you know. Take the chair\r\nnext to Mrs. Sellers, Washington--tut, tut, Marie Antoinette, let your\r\nbrother have the fork if he wants it, you are bigger than he is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington contemplated the banquet, and wondered if he were in his\r\nright mind. Was this the plain family dinner? And was it all present?\r\nIt was soon apparent that this was indeed the dinner: it was all on the\r\ntable: it consisted of abundance of clear, fresh water, and a basin of\r\nraw turnips--nothing more.\r\n\r\nWashington stole a glance at Mrs. Sellers's face, and would have given\r\nthe world, the next moment, if he could have spared her that. The poor\r\nwoman's face was crimson, and the tears stood in her eyes. Washington\r\ndid not know what to do. He wished he had never come there and spied out\r\nthis cruel poverty and brought pain to that poor little lady's heart\r\nand shame to her cheek; but he was there, and there was no escape. Col.\r\nSellers hitched back his coat sleeves airily from his wrists as who\r\nshould say \xe2\x80\x9cNow for solid enjoyment!\xe2\x80\x9d seized a fork, flourished it and\r\nbegan to harpoon turnips and deposit them in the plates before him \xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nme help you, Washington--Lafayette, pass this plate to Washington--ah,\r\nwell, well, my boy, things are looking pretty bright, now, I tell you.\r\nSpeculation--my! the whole atmosphere's full of money. I would'nt take\r\nthree fortunes for one little operation I've got on hand now--have\r\nanything from the casters? No? Well, you're right, you're right.\r\nSome people like mustard with turnips, but--now there was Baron\r\nPoniatowski--Lord, but that man did know how to live!--true Russian\r\nyou know, Russian to the back bone; I say to my wife, give me a Russian\r\nevery time, for a table comrade. The Baron used to say, 'Take mustard,\r\nSellers, try the mustard,--a man can't know what turnips are in\r\nperfection without, mustard,' but I always said, 'No, Baron, I'm a plain\r\nman and I want my food plain--none of your embellishments for Beriah\r\nSellers--no made dishes for me! And it's the best way--high living kills\r\nmore than it cures in this world, you can rest assured of that.--Yes\r\nindeed, Washington, I've got one little operation on hand that--take\r\nsome more water--help yourself, won't you?--help yourself, there's\r\nplenty of it.--You'll find it pretty good, I guess. How does that fruit\r\nstrike you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington said he did not know that he had ever tasted better. He did\r\nnot add that he detested turnips even when they were cooked--loathed\r\nthem in their natural state. No, he kept this to himself, and praised\r\nthe turnips to the peril of his soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you'd like them. Examine them--examine them--they'll bear\r\nit. See how perfectly firm and juicy they are--they can't start any like\r\nthem in this part of the country, I can tell you. These are from New\r\nJersey--I imported them myself. They cost like sin, too; but lord bless\r\nme, I go in for having the best of a thing, even if it does cost a\r\nlittle more--it's the best economy, in the long run. These are the\r\nEarly Malcolm--it's a turnip that can't be produced except in just one\r\norchard, and the supply never is up to the demand. Take some more water,\r\nWashington--you can't drink too much water with fruit--all the doctors\r\nsay that. The plague can't come where this article is, my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlague? What plague?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat plague, indeed? Why the Asiatic plague that nearly depopulated\r\nLondon a couple of centuries ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how does that concern us? There is no plague here, I reckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSh! I've let it out! Well, never mind--just keep it to yourself.\r\nPerhaps I oughtn't said anything, but its bound to come out sooner\r\nor later, so what is the odds? Old McDowells wouldn't like me\r\nto--to--bother it all, I'll jest tell the whole thing and let it go. You\r\nsee, I've been down to St. Louis, and I happened to run across old Dr.\r\nMcDowells--thinks the world of me, does the doctor. He's a man that\r\nkeeps himself to himself, and well he may, for he knows that he's got\r\na reputation that covers the whole earth--he won't condescend to open\r\nhimself out to many people, but lord bless you, he and I are just like\r\nbrothers; he won't let me go to a hotel when I'm in the city--says I'm\r\nthe only man that's company to him, and I don't know but there's some\r\ntruth in it, too, because although I never like to glorify myself and\r\nmake a great to-do over what I am or what I can do or what I know, I\r\ndon't mind saying here among friends that I am better read up in most\r\nsciences, maybe, than the general run of professional men in these days.\r\nWell, the other day he let me into a little secret, strictly on the\r\nquiet, about this matter of the plague.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see it's booming right along in our direction--follows the Gulf\r\nStream, you know, just as all those epidemics do, and within three\r\nmonths it will be just waltzing through this land like a whirlwind! And\r\nwhoever it touches can make his will and contract for the funeral.\r\nWell you can't cure it, you know, but you can prevent it. How? Turnips!\r\nthat's it! Turnips and water! Nothing like it in the world, old\r\nMcDowells says, just fill yourself up two or three times a day, and you\r\ncan snap your fingers at the plague. Sh!--keep mum, but just you\r\nconfine yourself to that diet and you're all right. I wouldn't have old\r\nMcDowells know that I told about it for anything--he never would speak\r\nto me again. Take some more water, Washington--the more water you drink,\r\nthe better. Here, let me give you some more of the turnips. No, no,\r\nno, now, I insist. There, now. Absorb those. They're, mighty\r\nsustaining--brim full of nutriment--all the medical books say so. Just\r\neat from four to seven good-sized turnips at a meal, and drink from a\r\npint and a half to a quart of water, and then just sit around a couple\r\nof hours and let them ferment. You'll feel like a fighting cock next\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFifteen or twenty minutes later the Colonel's tongue was still\r\nchattering away--he had piled up several future fortunes out of several\r\nincipient \xe2\x80\x9coperations\xe2\x80\x9d which he had blundered into within the past week,\r\nand was now soaring along through some brilliant expectations born of\r\nlate promising experiments upon the lacking ingredient of the eye-water.\r\nAnd at such a time Washington ought to have been a rapt and enthusiastic\r\nlistener, but he was not, for two matters disturbed his mind and\r\ndistracted his attention. One was, that he discovered, to his confusion\r\nand shame, that in allowing himself to be helped a second time to the\r\nturnips, he had robbed those hungry children. He had not needed the\r\ndreadful \xe2\x80\x9cfruit,\xe2\x80\x9d and had not wanted it; and when he saw the pathetic\r\nsorrow in their faces when they asked for more and there was no more to\r\ngive them, he hated himself for his stupidity and pitied the famishing\r\nyoung things with all his heart. The other matter that disturbed him was\r\nthe dire inflation that had begun in his stomach. It grew and grew,\r\nit became more and more insupportable. Evidently the turnips were\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfermenting.\xe2\x80\x9d He forced himself to sit still as long as he could, but\r\nhis anguish conquered him at last.\r\n\r\nHe rose in the midst of the Colonel's talk and excused himself on the\r\nplea of a previous engagement. The Colonel followed him to the door,\r\npromising over and over again that he would use his influence to get\r\nsome of the Early Malcolms for him, and insisting that he should not be\r\nsuch a stranger but come and take pot-luck with him every chance he\r\ngot. Washington was glad enough to get away and feel free again. He\r\nimmediately bent his steps toward home.\r\n\r\nIn bed he passed an hour that threatened to turn his hair gray, and\r\nthen a blessed calm settled down upon him that filled his heart with\r\ngratitude. Weak and languid, he made shift to turn himself about\r\nand seek rest and sleep; and as his soul hovered upon the brink of\r\nunconciousness, he heaved a long, deep sigh, and said to himself that in\r\nhis heart he had cursed the Colonel's preventive of rheumatism, before,\r\nand now let the plague come if it must--he was done with preventives; if\r\never any man beguiled him with turnips and water again, let him die the\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIf he dreamed at all that night, no gossiping spirit disturbed his\r\nvisions to whisper in his ear of certain matters just then in bud in\r\nthe East, more than a thousand miles away that after the lapse of a few\r\nyears would develop influences which would profoundly affect the fate\r\nand fortunes of the Hawkins family.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it's easy enough to make a fortune,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to be easier than it is, I begin to think,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, why don't you go into something? You'll never dig it out of the\r\nAstor Library.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf there be any place and time in the world where and when it seems easy\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9cgo into something\xe2\x80\x9d it is in Broadway on a spring morning, when one\r\nis walking city-ward, and has before him the long lines of palace-shops\r\nwith an occasional spire seen through the soft haze that lies over the\r\nlower town, and hears the roar and hum of its multitudinous traffic.\r\n\r\nTo the young American, here or elsewhere, the paths to fortune are\r\ninnumerable and all open; there is invitation in the air and success\r\nin all his wide horizon. He is embarrassed which to choose, and is not\r\nunlikely to waste years in dallying with his chances, before giving\r\nhimself to the serious tug and strain of a single object. He has no\r\ntraditions to bind him or guide him, and his impulse is to break away\r\nfrom the occupation his father has followed, and make a new way for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nPhilip Sterling used to say that if he should seriously set himself for\r\nten years to any one of the dozen projects that were in his brain, he\r\nfelt that he could be a rich man. He wanted to be rich, he had a sincere\r\ndesire for a fortune, but for some unaccountable reason he hesitated\r\nabout addressing himself to the narrow work of getting it. He never\r\nwalked Broadway, a part of its tide of abundant shifting life, without\r\nfeeling something of the flush of wealth, and unconsciously taking the\r\nelastic step of one well-to-do in this prosperous world.\r\n\r\nEspecially at night in the crowded theatre--Philip was too young to\r\nremember the old Chambers' Street box, where the serious Burton led his\r\nhilarious and pagan crew--in the intervals of the screaming comedy, when\r\nthe orchestra scraped and grunted and tooted its dissolute tunes, the\r\nworld seemed full of opportunities to Philip, and his heart exulted with\r\na conscious ability to take any of its prizes he chose to pluck.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was the swimming ease of the acting, on the stage, where\r\nvirtue had its reward in three easy acts, perhaps it was the excessive\r\nlight of the house, or the music, or the buzz of the excited talk\r\nbetween acts, perhaps it was youth which believed everything, but for\r\nsome reason while Philip was at the theatre he had the utmost confidence\r\nin life and his ready victory in it.\r\n\r\nDelightful illusion of paint and tinsel and silk attire, of cheap\r\nsentiment and high and mighty dialogue! Will there not always be rosin\r\nenough for the squeaking fiddle-bow?\r\n\r\nDo we not all like the maudlin hero, who is sneaking round the right\r\nentrance, in wait to steal the pretty wife of his rich and tyrannical\r\nneighbor from the paste-board cottage at the left entrance? and when\r\nhe advances down to the foot-lights and defiantly informs the audience\r\nthat, \xe2\x80\x9che who lays his hand on a woman except in the way of kindness,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n do we not all applaud so as to drown the rest of the sentence?\r\n\r\nPhilip never was fortunate enough to hear what would become of a man who\r\nshould lay his hand on a woman with the exception named; but he learned\r\nafterwards that the woman who lays her hand on a man, without any\r\nexception whatsoever, is always acquitted by the jury.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, though Philip Sterling did not know it, that he wanted\r\nseveral other things quite as much as he wanted wealth. The modest\r\nfellow would have liked fame thrust upon him for some worthy\r\nachievement; it might be for a book, or for the skillful management of\r\nsome great newspaper, or for some daring expedition like that of Lt.\r\nStrain or Dr. Kane. He was unable to decide exactly what it should be.\r\nSometimes he thought he would like to stand in a conspicuous pulpit and\r\nhumbly preach the gospel of repentance; and it even crossed his mind\r\nthat it would be noble to give himself to a missionary life to some\r\nbenighted region, where the date-palm grows, and the nightingale's voice\r\nis in tune, and the bul-bul sings on the off nights. If he were good\r\nenough he would attach himself to that company of young men in the\r\nTheological Seminary, who were seeing New York life in preparation for\r\nthe ministry.\r\n\r\nPhilip was a New England boy and had graduated at Yale; he had not\r\ncarried off with him all the learning of that venerable institution, but\r\nhe knew some things that were not in the regular course of study. A\r\nvery good use of the English language and considerable knowledge of its\r\nliterature was one of them; he could sing a song very well, not in time\r\nto be sure, but with enthusiasm; he could make a magnetic speech at a\r\nmoment's notice in the class room, the debating society, or upon any\r\nfence or dry-goods box that was convenient; he could lift himself by one\r\narm, and do the giant swing in the gymnasium; he could strike out from\r\nhis left shoulder; he could handle an oar like a professional and pull\r\nstroke in a winning race. Philip had a good appetite, a sunny temper,\r\nand a clear hearty laugh. He had brown hair, hazel eyes set wide apart,\r\na broad but not high forehead, and a fresh winning face. He was six feet\r\nhigh, with broad shoulders, long legs and a swinging gait; one of those\r\nloose-jointed, capable fellows, who saunter into the world with a free\r\nair and usually make a stir in whatever company they enter.\r\n\r\nAfter he left college Philip took the advice of friends and read law.\r\nLaw seemed to him well enough as a science, but he never could discover\r\na practical case where it appeared to him worth while to go to law, and\r\nall the clients who stopped with this new clerk in the ante-room of the\r\nlaw office where he was writing, Philip invariably advised to settle--no\r\nmatter how, but settle--greatly to the disgust of his employer, who\r\nknew that justice between man and man could only be attained by the\r\nrecognized processes, with the attendant fees. Besides Philip hated the\r\ncopying of pleadings, and he was certain that a life of \xe2\x80\x9cwhereases\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and \xe2\x80\x9caforesaids\xe2\x80\x9d and whipping the devil round the stump, would be\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\n[Note: these few paragraphs are nearly an autobiography of the life of\r\nCharles Dudley Warner whose contributions to the story start here with\r\nChapter XII. D.W.]\r\n\r\nHis pen therefore, and whereas, and not as aforesaid, strayed off into\r\nother scribbling. In an unfortunate hour, he had two or three papers\r\naccepted by first-class magazines, at three dollars the printed page,\r\nand, behold, his vocation was open to him. He would make his mark in\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nLife has no moment so sweet as that in which a young man believes\r\nhimself called into the immortal ranks of the masters of literature.\r\nIt is such a noble ambition, that it is a pity it has usually such a\r\nshallow foundation.\r\n\r\nAt the time of this history, Philip had gone to New York for a career.\r\nWith his talent he thought he should have little difficulty in getting\r\nan editorial position upon a metropolitan newspaper; not that he knew\r\nanything about newspaper work, or had the least idea of journalism;\r\nhe knew he was not fitted for the technicalities of the subordinate\r\ndepartments, but he could write leaders with perfect ease, he was sure.\r\nThe drudgery of the newspaper office was too distasteful, and besides\r\nit would be beneath the dignity of a graduate and a successful magazine\r\nwriter. He wanted to begin at the top of the ladder.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise he found that every situation in the editorial\r\ndepartment of the journals was full, always had been full, was always\r\nlikely to be full. It seemed to him that the newspaper managers didn't\r\nwant genius, but mere plodding and grubbing. Philip therefore read\r\ndiligently in the Astor library, planned literary works that should\r\ncompel attention, and nursed his genius. He had no friend wise enough\r\nto tell him to step into the Dorking Convention, then in session, make\r\na sketch of the men and women on the platform, and take it to the editor\r\nof the Daily Grapevine, and see what he could get a line for it.\r\n\r\nOne day he had an offer from some country friends, who believed in him,\r\nto take charge of a provincial daily newspaper, and he went to consult\r\nMr. Gringo--Gringo who years ago managed the Atlas--about taking the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it of course,\xe2\x80\x9d says Gringo, \xe2\x80\x9ctake anything that offers, why not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they want me to make it an opposition paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, make it that. That party is going to succeed, it's going to elect\r\nthe next president.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, stoutly, \xe2\x80\x9cits wrong in principle,\r\nand it ought not to succeed, but I don't see how I can go for a thing I\r\ndon't believe in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gringo, turning away with a shade of contempt,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou'll find if you are going into literature and newspaper work that\r\nyou can't afford a conscience like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Philip did afford it, and he wrote, thanking his friends, and\r\ndeclining because he said the political scheme would fail, and ought to\r\nfail. And he went back to his books and to his waiting for an opening\r\nlarge enough for his dignified entrance into the literary world.\r\n\r\nIt was in this time of rather impatient waiting that Philip was\r\none morning walking down Broadway with Henry Brierly. He frequently\r\naccompanied Henry part way down town to what the latter called his\r\noffice in Broad Street, to which he went, or pretended to go, with\r\nregularity every day. It was evident to the most casual acquaintance\r\nthat he was a man of affairs, and that his time was engrossed in the\r\nlargest sort of operations, about which there was a mysterious air. His\r\nliability to be suddenly summoned to Washington, or Boston or Montreal\r\nor even to Liverpool was always imminent. He never was so summoned, but\r\nnone of his acquaintances would have been surprised to hear any day that\r\nhe had gone to Panama or Peoria, or to hear from him that he had bought\r\nthe Bank of Commerce.\r\n\r\nThe two were intimate at that time,--they had been classmates--and saw\r\na great deal of each other. Indeed, they lived together in Ninth Street,\r\nin a boarding-house, there, which had the honor of lodging and partially\r\nfeeding several other young fellows of like kidney, who have since gone\r\ntheir several ways into fame or into obscurity.\r\n\r\nIt was during the morning walk to which reference has been made that\r\nHenry Brierly suddenly said, \xe2\x80\x9cPhilip, how would you like to go to St.\r\nJo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I should like it of all things,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Philip, with some\r\nhesitation, \xe2\x80\x9cbut what for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it's a big operation. We are going, a lot of us, railroad men,\r\nengineers, contractors. You know my uncle is a great railroad man. I've\r\nno doubt I can get you a chance to go if you'll go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in what capacity would I go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I'm going as an engineer. You can go as one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know an engine from a coal cart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cField engineer, civil engineer. You can begin by carrying a rod, and\r\nputting down the figures. It's easy enough. I'll show you about that.\r\nWe'll get Trautwine and some of those books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but what is it for, what is it all about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don't you see? We lay out a line, spot the good land, enter it up,\r\nknow where the stations are to be, spot them, buy lots; there's heaps of\r\nmoney in it. We wouldn't engineer long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen do you go?\xe2\x80\x9d was Philip's next question, after some moments of\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow. Is that too soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, its not too soon. I've been ready to go anywhere for six months.\r\nThe fact is, Henry, that I'm about tired of trying to force myself\r\ninto things, and am quite willing to try floating with the stream for a\r\nwhile, and see where I will land. This seems like a providential call;\r\nit's sudden enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two young men who were by this time full of the adventure, went down\r\nto the Wall street office of Henry's uncle and had a talk with that\r\nwily operator. The uncle knew Philip very well, and was pleased with his\r\nfrank enthusiasm, and willing enough to give him a trial in the western\r\nventure. It was settled therefore, in the prompt way in which things are\r\nsettled in New York, that they would start with the rest of the company\r\nnext morning for the west.\r\n\r\nOn the way up town these adventurers bought books on engineering, and\r\nsuits of India-rubber, which they supposed they would need in a new and\r\nprobably damp country, and many other things which nobody ever needed\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nThe night was spent in packing up and writing letters, for Philip would\r\nnot take such an important step without informing his friends. If they\r\ndisapprove, thought he, I've done my duty by letting them know. Happy\r\nyouth, that is ready to pack its valise, and start for Cathay on an\r\nhour's notice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way,\xe2\x80\x9d calls out Philip from his bed-room, to Henry, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere is\r\nSt. Jo.?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it's in Missouri somewhere, on the frontier I think. We'll get a\r\nmap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind the map. We will find the place itself. I was afraid it was\r\nnearer home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip wrote a long letter, first of all, to his mother, full of love\r\nand glowing anticipations of his new opening. He wouldn't bother her\r\nwith business details, but he hoped that the day was not far off when\r\nshe would see him return, with a moderate fortune, and something to add\r\nto the comfort of her advancing years.\r\n\r\nTo his uncle he said that he had made an arrangement with some New York\r\ncapitalists to go to Missouri, in a land and railroad operation, which\r\nwould at least give him a knowledge of the world and not unlikely offer\r\nhim a business opening. He knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he\r\nhad at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter.\r\n\r\nIt was to Ruth Bolton that Philip wrote last. He might never see her\r\nagain; he went to seek his fortune. He well knew the perils of the\r\nfrontier, the savage state of society, the lurking Indians and the\r\ndangers of fever. But there was no real danger to a person who took care\r\nof himself. Might he write to her often and, tell her of his life. If he\r\nreturned with a fortune, perhaps and perhaps. If he was unsuccessful, or\r\nif he never returned--perhaps it would be as well. No time or distance,\r\nhowever, would ever lessen his interest in her. He would say good-night,\r\nbut not good-bye.\r\n\r\nIn the soft beginning of a Spring morning, long before New York had\r\nbreakfasted, while yet the air of expectation hung about the wharves of\r\nthe metropolis, our young adventurers made their way to the Jersey City\r\nrailway station of the Erie road, to begin the long, swinging, crooked\r\njourney, over what a writer of a former day called a causeway of cracked\r\nrails and cows, to the West.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n     What ever to say be toke in his entente,\r\n     his langage was so fayer & pertynante,\r\n     yt semeth unto manys herying not only the worde,\r\n     but veryly the thyng.\r\n     Caxton's Book of Curtesye.\r\n\r\nIn the party of which our travelers found themselves members, was Duff\r\nBrown, the great railroad contractor, and subsequently a well-known\r\nmember of Congress; a bluff, jovial Bost'n man, thick-set, close shaven,\r\nwith a heavy jaw and a low forehead--a very pleasant man if you were\r\nnot in his way. He had government contracts also, custom houses and dry\r\ndocks, from Portland to New Orleans, and managed to get out of congress,\r\nin appropriations, about weight for weight of gold for the stone\r\nfurnished.\r\n\r\nAssociated with him, and also of this party, was Rodney Schaick, a\r\nsleek New York broker, a man as prominent in the church as in the\r\nstock exchange, dainty in his dress, smooth of speech, the necessary\r\ncomplement of Duff Brown in any enterprise that needed assurance and\r\nadroitness.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to find a pleasanter traveling party, one\r\nthat shook off more readily the artificial restraints of Puritanic\r\nstrictness, and took the world with good-natured allowance. Money was\r\nplenty for every attainable luxury, and there seemed to be no doubt\r\nthat its supply would continue, and that fortunes were about to be made\r\nwithout a great deal of toil. Even Philip soon caught the prevailing\r\nspirit; Barry did not need any inoculation, he always talked in six\r\nfigures. It was as natural for the dear boy to be rich as it is for most\r\npeople to be poor.\r\n\r\nThe elders of the party were not long in discovering the fact, which\r\nalmost all travelers to the west soon find out; that the water was\r\npoor. It must have been by a lucky premonition of this that they all had\r\nbrandy flasks with which to qualify the water of the country; and it\r\nwas no doubt from an uneasy feeling of the danger of being poisoned that\r\nthey kept experimenting, mixing a little of the dangerous and changing\r\nfluid, as they passed along, with the contents of the flasks, thus\r\nsaving their lives hour by hour. Philip learned afterwards that\r\ntemperance and the strict observance of Sunday and a certain gravity of\r\ndeportment are geographical habits, which people do not usually carry\r\nwith them away from home.\r\n\r\nOur travelers stopped in Chicago long enough to see that they could\r\nmake their fortunes there in two week's time, but it did not seem worth\r\nwhile; the west was more attractive; the further one went the wider the\r\nopportunities opened.\r\n\r\nThey took railroad to Alton and the steamboat from there to St. Louis,\r\nfor the change and to have a glimpse of the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn't this jolly?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Henry, dancing out of the barber's room, and\r\ncoming down the deck with a one, two, three step, shaven, curled and\r\nperfumed after his usual exquisite fashion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's jolly?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip, looking out upon the dreary and monotonous\r\nwaste through which the shaking steamboat was coughing its way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the whole thing; it's immense I can tell you. I wouldn't give that\r\nto be guaranteed a hundred thousand cold cash in a year's time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere's Mr. Brown?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is in the saloon, playing poker with Schaick and that long haired\r\nparty with the striped trousers, who scrambled aboard when the stage\r\nplank was half hauled in, and the big Delegate to Congress from out\r\nwest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's a fine looking fellow, that delegate, with his glossy, black\r\nwhiskers; looks like a Washington man; I shouldn't think he'd be at\r\npoker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, its only five cent ante, just to make it interesting, the Delegate\r\nsaid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I shouldn't think a representative in Congress would play poker any\r\nway in a public steamboat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, you've got to pass the time. I tried a hand myself, but those\r\nold fellows are too many for me. The Delegate knows all the points. I'd\r\nbet a hundred dollars he will ante his way right into the United States\r\nSenate when his territory comes in. He's got the cheek for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has the grave and thoughtful manner of expectoration of a public\r\nman, for one thing,\xe2\x80\x9d added Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, after a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat have you got on those big\r\nboots for; do you expect to wade ashore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm breaking 'em in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fact was Harry had got himself up in what he thought a proper\r\ncostume for a new country, and was in appearance a sort of compromise\r\nbetween a dandy of Broadway and a backwoodsman. Harry, with blue eyes,\r\nfresh complexion, silken whiskers and curly chestnut hair, was as\r\nhandsome as a fashion plate. He wore this morning a soft hat, a short\r\ncutaway coat, an open vest displaying immaculate linen, a leathern belt\r\nround his waist, and top-boots of soft leather, well polished, that came\r\nabove his knees and required a string attached to his belt to keep them\r\nup. The light hearted fellow gloried in these shining encasements of his\r\nwell shaped legs, and told Philip that they were a perfect protection\r\nagainst prairie rattle-snakes, which never strike above the knee.\r\n\r\nThe landscape still wore an almost wintry appearance when our travelers\r\nleft Chicago. It was a genial spring day when they landed at St. Louis;\r\nthe birds were singing, the blossoms of peach trees in city garden\r\nplots, made the air sweet, and in the roar and tumult on the long river\r\nlevee they found an excitement that accorded with their own hopeful\r\nanticipations.\r\n\r\nThe party went to the Southern Hotel, where the great Duff Brown was\r\nvery well known, and indeed was a man of so much importance that even\r\nthe office clerk was respectful to him. He might have respected in him\r\nalso a certain vulgar swagger and insolence of money, which the clerk\r\ngreatly admired.\r\n\r\nThe young fellows liked the house and liked the city; it seemed to them\r\na mighty free and hospitable town. Coming from the East they were struck\r\nwith many peculiarities. Everybody smoked in the streets, for one thing,\r\nthey noticed; everybody \xe2\x80\x9ctook a drink\xe2\x80\x9d in an open manner whenever he\r\nwished to do so or was asked, as if the habit needed no concealment or\r\napology. In the evening when they walked about they found people\r\nsitting on the door-steps of their dwellings, in a manner not usual in a\r\nnorthern city; in front of some of the hotels and saloons the side walks\r\nwere filled with chairs and benches--Paris fashion, said Harry--upon\r\nwhich people lounged in these warm spring evenings, smoking, always\r\nsmoking; and the clink of glasses and of billiard balls was in the air.\r\nIt was delightful.\r\n\r\nHarry at once found on landing that his back-woods custom would not be\r\nneeded in St. Louis, and that, in fact, he had need of all the resources\r\nof his wardrobe to keep even with the young swells of the town. But this\r\ndid not much matter, for Harry was always superior to his clothes. As\r\nthey were likely to be detained some time in the city, Harry told\r\nPhilip that he was going to improve his time. And he did. It was an\r\nencouragement to any industrious man to see this young fellow rise,\r\ncarefully dress himself, eat his breakfast deliberately, smoke his cigar\r\ntranquilly, and then repair to his room, to what he called his work,\r\nwith a grave and occupied manner, but with perfect cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nHarry would take off his coat, remove his cravat, roll up his\r\nshirt-sleeves, give his curly hair the right touch before the glass,\r\nget out his book on engineering, his boxes of instruments, his drawing\r\npaper, his profile paper, open the book of logarithms, mix his India\r\nink, sharpen his pencils, light a cigar, and sit down at the table to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clay out a line,\xe2\x80\x9d with the most grave notion that he was mastering the\r\ndetails of engineering. He would spend half a day in these preparations\r\nwithout ever working out a problem or having the faintest conception\r\nof the use of lines or logarithms. And when he had finished, he had the\r\nmost cheerful confidence that he had done a good day's work.\r\n\r\nIt made no difference, however, whether Harry was in his room in a hotel\r\nor in a tent, Philip soon found, he was just the same. In camp he would\r\nget himself up in the most elaborate toilet at his command, polish his\r\nlong boots to the top, lay out his work before him, and spend an hour or\r\nlonger, if anybody was looking at him, humming airs, knitting his brows,\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cworking\xe2\x80\x9d at engineering; and if a crowd of gaping rustics were\r\nlooking on all the while it was perfectly satisfactory to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d he says to Philip one morning at the hotel when he was thus\r\nengaged, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to get the theory of this thing, so that I can have a\r\ncheck on the engineers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you were going to be an engineer yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d queried Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot many times, if the court knows herself. There's better game. Brown\r\nand Schaick have, or will have, the control for the whole line of the\r\nSalt Lick Pacific Extension, forty thousand dollars a mile over the\r\nprairie, with extra for hard-pan--and it'll be pretty much all hardpan\r\nI can tell you; besides every alternate section of land on this line.\r\nThere's millions in the job. I'm to have the sub-contract for the first\r\nfifty miles, and you can bet it's a soft thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll tell you what you do, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Larry, in a burst of\r\ngenerosity, \xe2\x80\x9cif I don't get you into my contract, you'll be with the\r\nengineers, and you jest stick a stake at the first ground marked for a\r\ndepot, buy the land of the farmer before he knows where the depot will\r\nbe, and we'll turn a hundred or so on that. I'll advance the money for\r\nthe payments, and you can sell the lots. Schaick is going to let me have\r\nten thousand just for a flyer in such operations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that's a good deal of money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait till you are used to handling money. I didn't come out here for\r\na bagatelle. My uncle wanted me to stay East and go in on the Mobile\r\ncustom house, work up the Washington end of it; he said there was a\r\nfortune in it for a smart young fellow, but I preferred to take the\r\nchances out here. Did I tell you I had an offer from Bobbett and\r\nFanshaw to go into their office as confidential clerk on a salary of ten\r\nthousand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn't you take it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip, to whom a salary of two thousand\r\nwould have seemed wealth, before he started on this journey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it? I'd rather operate on my own hook;\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry, in his most\r\nairy manner.\r\n\r\nA few evenings after their arrival at the Southern, Philip and Harry\r\nmade the acquaintance of a very agreeable gentleman, whom they had\r\nfrequently seen before about the hotel corridors, and passed a casual\r\nword with. He had the air of a man of business, and was evidently a\r\nperson of importance.\r\n\r\nThe precipitating of this casual intercourse into the more substantial\r\nform of an acquaintanceship was the work of the gentleman himself, and\r\noccurred in this wise. Meeting the two friends in the lobby one evening,\r\nhe asked them to give him the time, and added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, gentlemen--strangers in St. Louis? Ah, yes-yes. From the\r\nEast, perhaps? Ah; just so, just so. Eastern born myself--Virginia.\r\nSellers is my name--Beriah Sellers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! by the way--New York, did you say? That reminds me; just met\r\nsome gentlemen from your State, a week or two ago--very prominent\r\ngentlemen--in public life they are; you must know them, without doubt.\r\nLet me see--let me see. Curious those names have escaped me. I know\r\nthey were from your State, because I remember afterward my old friend\r\nGovernor Shackleby said to me--fine man, is the Governor--one of the\r\nfinest men our country has produced--said he, 'Colonel, how did you\r\nlike those New York gentlemen?--not many such men in the world,--Colonel\r\nSellers,' said the Governor--yes, it was New York he said--I remember it\r\ndistinctly. I can't recall those names, somehow. But no matter. Stopping\r\nhere, gentlemen--stopping at the Southern?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn shaping their reply in their minds, the title \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\xe2\x80\x9d had a place in\r\nit; but when their turn had arrived to speak, the title \xe2\x80\x9cColonel\xe2\x80\x9d came\r\nfrom their lips instead.\r\n\r\nThey said yes, they were abiding at the Southern, and thought it a very\r\ngood house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, the Southern is fair. I myself go to the Planter's, old,\r\naristocratic house. We Southern gentlemen don't change our ways, you\r\nknow. I always make it my home there when I run down from Hawkeye--my\r\nplantation is in Hawkeye, a little up in the country. You should know\r\nthe Planter's.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip and Harry both said they should like to see a hotel that had been\r\nso famous in its day--a cheerful hostelrie, Philip said it must have\r\nbeen where duels were fought there across the dining-room table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may believe it, sir, an uncommonly pleasant lodging. Shall we\r\nwalk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the three strolled along the streets, the Colonel talking all\r\nthe way in the most liberal and friendly manner, and with a frank\r\nopen-heartedness that inspired confidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, born East myself, raised all along, know the West--a great\r\ncountry, gentlemen. The place for a young fellow of spirit to pick up a\r\nfortune, simply pick it up, it's lying round loose here. Not a day that\r\nI don't put aside an opportunity; too busy to look into it. Management\r\nof my own property takes my time. First visit? Looking for an opening?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, looking around,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, here we are. You'd rather sit here in front than go to my\r\napartments? So had I. An opening eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel's eyes twinkled. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, just so. The country is opening up,\r\nall we want is capital to develop it. Slap down the rails and bring the\r\nland into market. The richest land on God Almighty's footstool is\r\nlying right out there. If I had my capital free I could plant it for\r\nmillions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose your capital is largely in your plantation?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, partly, sir, partly. I'm down here now with reference to a little\r\noperation--a little side thing merely. By the way gentlemen, excuse the\r\nliberty, but it's about my usual time\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\nThe Colonel paused, but as no movement of his acquaintances followed\r\nthis plain remark, he added, in an explanatory manner,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm rather particular about the exact time--have to be in this\r\nclimate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven this open declaration of his hospitable intention not being\r\nunderstood the Colonel politely said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, will you take something?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCol. Sellers led the way to a saloon on Fourth street under the hotel,\r\nand the young gentlemen fell into the custom of the country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel to the bar-keeper, who shoved along the\r\ncounter a bottle of apparently corn-whiskey, as if he had done it before\r\non the same order; \xe2\x80\x9cnot that,\xe2\x80\x9d with a wave of the hand. \xe2\x80\x9cThat Otard if\r\nyou please. Yes. Never take an inferior liquor, gentlemen, not in the\r\nevening, in this climate. There. That's the stuff. My respects!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hospitable gentleman, having disposed of his liquor, remarking that\r\nit was not quite the thing--\xe2\x80\x9cwhen a man has his own cellar to go to, he\r\nis apt to get a little fastidious about his liquors\xe2\x80\x9d--called for cigars.\r\nBut the brand offered did not suit him; he motioned the box away, and\r\nasked for some particular Havana's, those in separate wrappers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always smoke this sort, gentlemen; they are a little more expensive,\r\nbut you'll learn, in this climate, that you'd better not economize on\r\npoor cigars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving imparted this valuable piece of information, the Colonel lighted\r\nthe fragrant cigar with satisfaction, and then carelessly put his\r\nfingers into his right vest pocket. That movement being without result,\r\nwith a shade of disappointment on his face, he felt in his left vest\r\npocket. Not finding anything there, he looked up with a serious and\r\nannoyed air, anxiously slapped his right pantaloon's pocket, and then\r\nhis left, and exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy George, that's annoying. By George, that's mortifying. Never had\r\nanything of that kind happen to me before. I've left my pocket-book.\r\nHold! Here's a bill, after all. No, thunder, it's a receipt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, seeing how seriously the Colonel was annoyed,\r\nand taking out his purse.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel protested he couldn't think of it, and muttered something to\r\nthe barkeeper about \xe2\x80\x9changing it up,\xe2\x80\x9d but the vender of exhilaration made\r\nno sign, and Philip had the privilege of paying the costly shot; Col.\r\nSellers profusely apologizing and claiming the right \xe2\x80\x9cnext time, next\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as Beriah Sellers had bade his friends good night and seen them\r\ndepart, he did not retire apartments in the Planter's, but took his way\r\nto his lodgings with a friend in a distant part of the city.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nThe letter that Philip Sterling wrote to Ruth Bolton, on the evening of\r\nsetting out to seek his fortune in the west, found that young lady in\r\nher own father's house in Philadelphia. It was one of the pleasantest\r\nof the many charming suburban houses in that hospitable city, which is\r\nterritorially one of the largest cities in the world, and only prevented\r\nfrom becoming the convenient metropolis of the country by the intrusive\r\nstrip of Camden and Amboy sand which shuts it off from the Atlantic\r\nocean. It is a city of steady thrift, the arms of which might well be\r\nthe deliberate but delicious terrapin that imparts such a royal flavor\r\nto its feasts.\r\n\r\nIt was a spring morning, and perhaps it was the influence of it that\r\nmade Ruth a little restless, satisfied neither with the out-doors nor\r\nthe in-doors. Her sisters had gone to the city to show some country\r\nvisitors Independence Hall, Girard College and Fairmount Water Works\r\nand Park, four objects which Americans cannot die peacefully, even in\r\nNaples, without having seen. But Ruth confessed that she was tired of\r\nthem, and also of the Mint. She was tired of other things. She tried\r\nthis morning an air or two upon the piano, sang a simple song in a\r\nsweet but slightly metallic voice, and then seating herself by the open\r\nwindow, read Philip's letter. Was she thinking about Philip, as she\r\ngazed across the fresh lawn over the tree tops to the Chelton Hills, or\r\nof that world which his entrance, into her tradition-bound life had been\r\none of the means of opening to her? Whatever she thought, she was not\r\nidly musing, as one might see by the expression of her face. After a\r\ntime she took up a book; it was a medical work, and to all appearance\r\nabout as interesting to a girl of eighteen as the statutes at large; but\r\nher face was soon aglow over its pages, and she was so absorbed in it\r\nthat she did not notice the entrance of her mother at the open door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young student, looking up, with a shade of\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to talk with thee a little about thy plans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother; thee knows I couldn't stand it at Westfield; the school stifled\r\nme, it's a place to turn young people into dried fruit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Margaret Bolton, with a half anxious smile, \xe2\x80\x9cthee chafes\r\nagainst all the ways of Friends, but what will thee do? Why is thee so\r\ndiscontented?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I must say it, mother, I want to go away, and get out of this dead\r\nlevel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a look half of pain and half of pity, her mother answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nsure thee is little interfered with; thee dresses as thee will, and goes\r\nwhere thee pleases, to any church thee likes, and thee has music. I had\r\na visit yesterday from the society's committee by way of discipline,\r\nbecause we have a piano in the house, which is against the rules.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope thee told the elders that father and I are responsible for the\r\npiano, and that, much as thee loves music, thee is never in the room\r\nwhen it is played. Fortunately father is already out of meeting, so\r\nthey can't discipline him. I heard father tell cousin Abner that he was\r\nwhipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined\r\nto have what compensation he could get now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy ways greatly try me, Ruth, and all thy relations. I desire thy\r\nhappiness first of all, but thee is starting out on a dangerous path.\r\nIs thy father willing thee should go away to a school of the world's\r\npeople?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not asked him,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth replied with a look that might imply that\r\nshe was one of those determined little bodies who first made up her\r\nown mind and then compelled others to make up theirs in accordance with\r\nhers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when thee has got the education thee wants, and lost all relish for\r\nthe society of thy friends and the ways of thy ancestors, what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth turned square round to her mother, and with an impassive face and\r\nnot the slightest change of tone, said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, I'm going to study medicine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMargaret Bolton almost lost for a moment her habitual placidity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee, study medicine! A slight frail girl like thee, study medicine!\r\nDoes thee think thee could stand it six months? And the lectures, and\r\nthe dissecting rooms, has thee thought of the dissecting rooms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ruth calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cI have thought it all over. I know I can go\r\nthrough the whole, clinics, dissecting room and all. Does thee think I\r\nlack nerve? What is there to fear in a person dead more than in a person\r\nliving?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut thy health and strength, child; thee can never stand the severe\r\napplication. And, besides, suppose thee does learn medicine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will practice it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere thee and thy family are known?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I can get patients.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope at least, Ruth, thee will let us know when thee opens an\r\noffice,\xe2\x80\x9d said her mother, with an approach to sarcasm that she rarely\r\nindulged in, as she rose and left the room.\r\n\r\nRuth sat quite still for a time, with face intent and flushed. It was\r\nout now. She had begun her open battle.\r\n\r\nThe sight-seers returned in high spirits from the city. Was there any\r\nbuilding in Greece to compare with Girard College, was there ever such a\r\nmagnificent pile of stone devised for the shelter of poor orphans? Think\r\nof the stone shingles of the roof eight inches thick! Ruth asked the\r\nenthusiasts if they would like to live in such a sounding mausoleum,\r\nwith its great halls and echoing rooms, and no comfortable place in it\r\nfor the accommodation of any body? If they were orphans, would they like\r\nto be brought up in a Grecian temple?\r\n\r\nAnd then there was Broad street! Wasn't it the broadest and the longest\r\nstreet in the world? There certainly was no end to it, and even Ruth was\r\nPhiladelphian enough to believe that a street ought not to have any end,\r\nor architectural point upon which the weary eye could rest.\r\n\r\nBut neither St. Girard, nor Broad street, neither wonders of the Mint\r\nnor the glories of the Hall where the ghosts of our fathers sit always\r\nsigning the Declaration; impressed the visitors so much as the splendors\r\nof the Chestnut street windows, and the bargains on Eighth street. The\r\ntruth is that the country cousins had come to town to attend the Yearly\r\nMeeting, and the amount of shopping that preceded that religious event\r\nwas scarcely exceeded by the preparations for the opera in more worldly\r\ncircles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs thee going to the Yearly Meeting, Ruth?\xe2\x80\x9d asked one of the girls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to wear,\xe2\x80\x9d replied that demure person. \xe2\x80\x9cIf thee wants to\r\nsee new bonnets, orthodox to a shade and conformed to the letter of the\r\ntrue form, thee must go to the Arch Street Meeting. Any departure from\r\neither color or shape would be instantly taken note of. It has occupied\r\nmother a long time, to find at the shops the exact shade for her new\r\nbonnet. Oh, thee must go by all means. But thee won't see there a\r\nsweeter woman than mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thee won't go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I? I've been again and again. If I go to Meeting at all I\r\nlike best to sit in the quiet old house in Germantown, where the windows\r\nare all open and I can see the trees, and hear the stir of the leaves.\r\nIt's such a crush at the Yearly Meeting at Arch Street, and then there's\r\nthe row of sleek-looking young men who line the curbstone and stare at\r\nus as we come out. No, I don't feel at home there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat evening Ruth and her father sat late by the drawing-room fire, as\r\nthey were quite apt to do at night. It was always a time of confidences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee has another letter from young Sterling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eli Bolton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Philip has gone to the far west.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn't say, but it's on the frontier, and on the map everything\r\nbeyond it is marked 'Indians' and 'desert,' and looks as desolate as a\r\nWednesday Meeting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph. It was time for him to do something. Is he going to start a\r\ndaily newspaper among the Kick-a-poos?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, thee's unjust to Philip. He's going into business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of business can a young man go into without capital?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn't say exactly what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ruth a little dubiously, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nit's something about land and railroads, and thee knows, father, that\r\nfortunes are made nobody knows exactly how, in a new country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so, you innocent puss, and in an old one too. But Philip\r\nis honest, and he has talent enough, if he will stop scribbling, to make\r\nhis way. But thee may as well take care of theeself, Ruth, and not go\r\ndawdling along with a young man in his adventures, until thy own mind is\r\na little more settled what thee wants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis excellent advice did not seem to impress Ruth greatly, for she was\r\nlooking away with that abstraction of vision which often came into her\r\ngrey eyes, and at length she exclaimed, with a sort of impatience,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could go west, or south, or somewhere. What a box women are\r\nput into, measured for it, and put in young; if we go anywhere it's in\r\na box, veiled and pinioned and shut in by disabilities. Father, I should\r\nlike to break things and get loose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat a sweet-voiced little innocent, it was to be sure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee will no doubt break things enough when thy time comes, child;\r\nwomen always have; but what does thee want now that thee hasn't?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to be something, to make myself something, to do something. Why\r\nshould I rust, and be stupid, and sit in inaction because I am a girl?\r\nWhat would happen to me if thee should lose thy property and die? What\r\none useful thing could I do for a living, for the support of mother\r\nand the children? And if I had a fortune, would thee want me to lead a\r\nuseless life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas thy mother led a useless life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomewhat that depends upon whether her children amount to anything,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n retorted the sharp little disputant. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat's the good, father, of a\r\nseries of human beings who don't advance any?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFriend Eli, who had long ago laid aside the Quaker dress, and was out of\r\nMeeting, and who in fact after a youth of doubt could not yet define his\r\nbelief, nevertheless looked with some wonder at this fierce young eagle\r\nof his, hatched in a Friend's dove-cote. But he only said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas thee consulted thy mother about a career, I suppose it is a career\r\nthee wants?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth did not reply directly; she complained that her mother didn't\r\nunderstand her. But that wise and placid woman understood the sweet\r\nrebel a great deal better than Ruth understood herself. She also had a\r\nhistory, possibly, and had sometime beaten her young wings against the\r\ncage of custom, and indulged in dreams of a new social order, and had\r\npassed through that fiery period when it seems possible for one mind,\r\nwhich has not yet tried its limits, to break up and re-arrange the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nRuth replied to Philip's letter in due time and in the most cordial and\r\nunsentimental manner. Philip liked the letter, as he did everything she\r\ndid; but he had a dim notion that there was more about herself in the\r\nletter than about him. He took it with him from the Southern Hotel, when\r\nhe went to walk, and read it over and again in an unfrequented street\r\nas he stumbled along. The rather common-place and unformed hand-writing\r\nseemed to him peculiar and characteristic, different from that of any\r\nother woman.\r\n\r\nRuth was glad to hear that Philip had made a push into the world, and\r\nshe was sure that his talent and courage would make a way for him.\r\nShe should pray for his success at any rate, and especially that the\r\nIndians, in St. Louis, would not take his scalp.\r\n\r\nPhilip looked rather dubious at this sentence, and wished that he had\r\nwritten nothing about Indians.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nEli Bolton and his wife talked over Ruth's case, as they had often done\r\nbefore, with no little anxiety. Alone of all their children she was\r\nimpatient of the restraints and monotony of the Friends' Society, and\r\nwholly indisposed to accept the \xe2\x80\x9cinner light\xe2\x80\x9d as a guide into a life of\r\nacceptance and inaction. When Margaret told her husband of Ruth's newest\r\nproject, he did not exhibit so much surprise as she hoped for. In fact\r\nhe said that he did not see why a woman should not enter the medical\r\nprofession if she felt a call to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Margaret, \xe2\x80\x9cconsider her total inexperience of the world, and\r\nher frail health. Can such a slight little body endure the ordeal of the\r\npreparation for, or the strain of, the practice of the profession?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid thee ever think, Margaret, whether, she can endure being thwarted\r\nin an object on which she has so set her heart, as she has on this? Thee\r\nhas trained her thyself at home, in her enfeebled childhood, and thee\r\nknows how strong her will is, and what she has been able to accomplish\r\nin self-culture by the simple force of her determination. She never will\r\nbe satisfied until she has tried her own strength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Margaret, with an inconsequence that is not exclusively\r\nfeminine, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she were in the way to fall in love and marry by and by.\r\nI think that would cure her of some of her notions. I am not sure but\r\nif she went away, to some distant school, into an entirely new life, her\r\nthoughts would be diverted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEli Bolton almost laughed as he regarded his wife, with eyes that never\r\nlooked at her except fondly, and replied,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps thee remembers that thee had notions also, before we were\r\nmarried, and before thee became a member of Meeting. I think Ruth comes\r\nhonestly by certain tendencies which thee has hidden under the Friend's\r\ndress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMargaret could not say no to this, and while she paused, it was evident\r\nthat memory was busy with suggestions to shake her present opinions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not let Ruth try the study for a time,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Eli; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is\r\na fair beginning of a Woman's Medical College in the city. Quite likely\r\nshe will soon find that she needs first a more general culture, and fall\r\nin with thy wish that she should see more of the world at some large\r\nschool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere really seemed to be nothing else to be done, and Margaret\r\nconsented at length without approving. And it was agreed that Ruth, in\r\norder to spare her fatigue, should take lodgings with friends near the\r\ncollege and make a trial in the pursuit of that science to which we all\r\nowe our lives, and sometimes as by a miracle of escape.\r\n\r\nThat day Mr. Bolton brought home a stranger to dinner, Mr. Bigler of the\r\ngreat firm of Pennybacker, Bigler & Small, railroad contractors. He was\r\nalways bringing home somebody, who had a scheme; to build a road, or\r\nopen a mine, or plant a swamp with cane to grow paper-stock, or found a\r\nhospital, or invest in a patent shad-bone separator, or start a college\r\nsomewhere on the frontier, contiguous to a land speculation.\r\n\r\nThe Bolton house was a sort of hotel for this kind of people. They were\r\nalways coming. Ruth had known them from childhood, and she used to say\r\nthat her father attracted them as naturally as a sugar hogshead does\r\nflies. Ruth had an idea that a large portion of the world lived by\r\ngetting the rest of the world into schemes. Mr. Bolton never could\r\nsay \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d to any of them, not even, said Ruth again, to the society for\r\nstamping oyster shells with scripture texts before they were sold at\r\nretail.\r\n\r\nMr. Bigler's plan this time, about which he talked loudly, with his\r\nmouth full, all dinner time, was the building of the Tunkhannock,\r\nRattlesnake and Youngwomans Town Railroad, which would not only be\r\na great highway to the west, but would open to market inexhaustible\r\ncoal-fields and untold millions of lumber. The plan of operations was\r\nvery simple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe'll buy the lands,\xe2\x80\x9d explained he, \xe2\x80\x9con long time, backed by the notes\r\nof good men; and then mortgage them for money enough to get the road\r\nwell on. Then get the towns on the line to issue their bonds for stock,\r\nand sell their bonds for enough to complete the road, and partly stock\r\nit, especially if we mortgage each section as we complete it. We can\r\nthen sell the rest of the stock on the prospect of the business of\r\nthe road through an improved country, and also sell the lands at a big\r\nadvance, on the strength of the road. All we want,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mr. Bigler\r\nin his frank manner, \xe2\x80\x9cis a few thousand dollars to start the surveys,\r\nand arrange things in the legislature. There is some parties will have\r\nto be seen, who might make us trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will take a good deal of money to start the enterprise,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked\r\nMr. Bolton, who knew very well what \xe2\x80\x9cseeing\xe2\x80\x9d a Pennsylvania Legislature\r\nmeant, but was too polite to tell Mr. Bigler what he thought of him,\r\nwhile he was his guest; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat security would one have for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bigler smiled a hard kind of smile, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou'd be inside, Mr.\r\nBolton, and you'd have the first chance in the deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was rather unintelligible to Ruth, who was nevertheless somewhat\r\namused by the study of a type of character she had seen before. At\r\nlength she interrupted the conversation by asking,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'd sell the stock, I suppose, Mr. Bigler, to anybody who was\r\nattracted by the prospectus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, certainly, serve all alike,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bigler, now noticing Ruth for\r\nthe first time, and a little puzzled by the serene, intelligent face\r\nthat was turned towards him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what would become of the poor people who had been led to put\r\ntheir little money into the speculation, when you got out of it and left\r\nit half way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt would be no more true to say of Mr. Bigler that he was or could be\r\nembarrassed, than to say that a brass counterfeit dollar-piece would\r\nchange color when refused; the question annoyed him a little, in Mr.\r\nBolton's presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, Miss, of course, in a great enterprise for the benefit of the\r\ncommunity there will little things occur, which, which--and, of course,\r\nthe poor ought to be looked to; I tell my wife, that the poor must be\r\nlooked to; if you can tell who are poor--there's so many impostors. And\r\nthen, there's so many poor in the legislature to be looked after,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe contractor with a sort of a chuckle, \xe2\x80\x9cisn't that so, Mr. Bolton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEli Bolton replied that he never had much to do with the legislature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d continued this public benefactor, \xe2\x80\x9can uncommon poor lot this\r\nyear, uncommon. Consequently an expensive lot. The fact is, Mr. Bolton,\r\nthat the price is raised so high on United States Senator now, that it\r\naffects the whole market; you can't get any public improvement through\r\non reasonable terms. Simony is what I call it, Simony,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr.\r\nBigler, as if he had said a good thing.\r\n\r\nMr. Bigler went on and gave some very interesting details of the\r\nintimate connection between railroads and politics, and thoroughly\r\nentertained himself all dinner time, and as much disgusted Ruth, who\r\nasked no more questions, and her father who replied in monosyllables:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ruth to her father, after the guest had gone, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you\r\nwouldn't bring home any more such horrid men. Do all men who wear\r\nbig diamond breast-pins, flourish their knives at table, and use bad\r\ngrammar, and cheat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, child, thee mustn't be too observing. Mr. Bigler is one of the most\r\nimportant men in the state; nobody has more influence at Harrisburg. I\r\ndon't like him any more than thee does, but I'd better lend him a little\r\nmoney than to have his ill will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, I think thee'd better have his ill-will than his company. Is\r\nit true that he gave money to help build the pretty little church of St.\r\nJames the Less, and that he is, one of the vestrymen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. He is not such a bad fellow. One of the men in Third street asked\r\nhim the other day, whether his was a high church or a low church?\r\nBigler said he didn't know; he'd been in it once, and he could touch the\r\nceiling in the side aisle with his hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he's just horrid,\xe2\x80\x9d was Ruth's final summary of him, after the\r\nmanner of the swift judgment of women, with no consideration of the\r\nextenuating circumstances. Mr. Bigler had no idea that he had not made\r\na good impression on the whole family; he certainly intended to be\r\nagreeable. Margaret agreed with her daughter, and though she never said\r\nanything to such people, she was grateful to Ruth for sticking at least\r\none pin into him.\r\n\r\nSuch was the serenity of the Bolton household that a stranger in it\r\nwould never have suspected there was any opposition to Ruth's going to\r\nthe Medical School. And she went quietly to take her residence in town,\r\nand began her attendance of the lectures, as if it were the most\r\nnatural thing in the world. She did not heed, if she heard, the busy and\r\nwondering gossip of relations and acquaintances, gossip that has no less\r\ncurrency among the Friends than elsewhere because it is whispered slyly\r\nand creeps about in an undertone.\r\n\r\nRuth was absorbed, and for the first time in her life thoroughly happy;\r\nhappy in the freedom of her life, and in the keen enjoyment of the\r\ninvestigation that broadened its field day by day. She was in high\r\nspirits when she came home to spend First Days; the house was full of\r\nher gaiety and her merry laugh, and the children wished that Ruth would\r\nnever go away again. But her mother noticed, with a little anxiety, the\r\nsometimes flushed face, and the sign of an eager spirit in the kindling\r\neyes, and, as well, the serious air of determination and endurance in\r\nher face at unguarded moments.\r\n\r\nThe college was a small one and it sustained itself not without\r\ndifficulty in this city, which is so conservative, and is yet the\r\norigin of so many radical movements. There were not more than a dozen\r\nattendants on the lectures all together, so that the enterprise had\r\nthe air of an experiment, and the fascination of pioneering for those\r\nengaged in it. There was one woman physician driving about town in\r\nher carriage, attacking the most violent diseases in all quarters with\r\npersistent courage, like a modern Bellona in her war chariot, who\r\nwas popularly supposed to gather in fees to the amount ten to twenty\r\nthousand dollars a year. Perhaps some of these students looked forward\r\nto the near day when they would support such a practice and a husband\r\nbesides, but it is unknown that any of them ever went further than\r\npractice in hospitals and in their own nurseries, and it is feared that\r\nsome of them were quite as ready as their sisters, in emergencies, to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccall a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Ruth had any exaggerated expectations of a professional life, she\r\nkept them to herself, and was known to her fellows of the class simply\r\nas a cheerful, sincere student, eager in her investigations, and never\r\nimpatient at anything, except an insinuation that women had not as much\r\nmental capacity for science as men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey really say,\xe2\x80\x9d said one young Quaker sprig to another youth of\r\nhis age, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Ruth Bolton is really going to be a saw-bones, attends\r\nlectures, cuts up bodies, and all that. She's cool enough for a surgeon,\r\nanyway.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke feelingly, for he had very likely been weighed in\r\nRuth's calm eyes sometime, and thoroughly scared by the little laugh\r\nthat accompanied a puzzling reply to one of his conversational nothings.\r\nSuch young gentlemen, at this time, did not come very distinctly into\r\nRuth's horizon, except as amusing circumstances.\r\n\r\nAbout the details of her student life, Ruth said very little to her\r\nfriends, but they had reason to know, afterwards, that it required all\r\nher nerve and the almost complete exhaustion of her physical strength,\r\nto carry her through. She began her anatomical practice upon detached\r\nportions of the human frame, which were brought into the demonstrating\r\nroom--dissecting the eye, the ear, and a small tangle of muscles and\r\nnerves--an occupation which had not much more savor of death in it than\r\nthe analysis of a portion of a plant out of which the life went when it\r\nwas plucked up by the roots. Custom inures the most sensitive persons\r\nto that which is at first most repellant; and in the late war we saw the\r\nmost delicate women, who could not at home endure the sight of blood,\r\nbecome so used to scenes of carnage, that they walked the hospitals and\r\nthe margins of battle-fields, amid the poor remnants of torn humanity,\r\nwith as perfect self-possession as if they were strolling in a flower\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nIt happened that Ruth was one evening deep in a line of investigation\r\nwhich she could not finish or understand without demonstration, and so\r\neager was she in it, that it seemed as if she could not wait till the\r\nnext day. She, therefore, persuaded a fellow student, who was reading\r\nthat evening with her, to go down to the dissecting room of the college,\r\nand ascertain what they wanted to know by an hour's work there. Perhaps,\r\nalso, Ruth wanted to test her own nerve, and to see whether the power of\r\nassociation was stronger in her mind than her own will.\r\n\r\nThe janitor of the shabby and comfortless old building admitted the\r\ngirls, not without suspicion, and gave them lighted candles, which they\r\nwould need, without other remark than \xe2\x80\x9cthere's a new one, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d as the\r\ngirls went up the broad stairs.\r\n\r\nThey climbed to the third story, and paused before a door, which they\r\nunlocked, and which admitted them into a long apartment, with a row of\r\nwindows on one side and one at the end. The room was without light, save\r\nfrom the stars and the candles the girls carried, which revealed to them\r\ndimly two long and several small tables, a few benches and chairs, a\r\ncouple of skeletons hanging on the wall, a sink, and cloth-covered heaps\r\nof something upon the tables here and there.\r\n\r\nThe windows were open, and the cool night wind came in strong enough to\r\nflutter a white covering now and then, and to shake the loose casements.\r\nBut all the sweet odors of the night could not take from the room a\r\nfaint suggestion of mortality.\r\n\r\nThe young ladies paused a moment. The room itself was familiar enough,\r\nbut night makes almost any chamber eerie, and especially such a room of\r\ndetention as this where the mortal parts of the unburied might--almost\r\nbe supposed to be, visited, on the sighing night winds, by the wandering\r\nspirits of their late tenants.\r\n\r\nOpposite and at some distance across the roofs of lower buildings, the\r\ngirls saw a tall edifice, the long upper story of which seemed to be a\r\ndancing hall. The windows of that were also open, and through them they\r\nheard the scream of the jiggered and tortured violin, and the pump,\r\npump of the oboe, and saw the moving shapes of men and women in quick\r\ntransition, and heard the prompter's drawl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ruth, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the girls dancing there would think if they\r\nsaw us, or knew that there was such a room as this so near them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not speak very loud, and, perhaps unconsciously, the girls drew\r\nnear to each other as they approached the long table in the centre of\r\nthe room. A straight object lay upon it, covered with a sheet. This was\r\ndoubtless \xe2\x80\x9cthe new one\xe2\x80\x9d of which the janitor spoke. Ruth advanced, and\r\nwith a not very steady hand lifted the white covering from the upper\r\npart of the figure and turned it down. Both the girls started. It was a\r\nnegro. The black face seemed to defy the pallor of death, and asserted\r\nan ugly life-likeness that was frightful.\r\n\r\nRuth was as pale as the white sheet, and her comrade whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\naway, Ruth, it is awful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was the wavering light of the candles, perhaps it was only\r\nthe agony from a death of pain, but the repulsive black face seemed\r\nto wear a scowl that said, \xe2\x80\x9cHaven't you yet done with the outcast,\r\npersecuted black man, but you must now haul him from his grave, and send\r\neven your women to dismember his body?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWho is this dead man, one of thousands who died yesterday, and will be\r\ndust anon, to protest that science shall not turn his worthless carcass\r\nto some account?\r\n\r\nRuth could have had no such thought, for with a pity in her sweet face,\r\nthat for the moment overcame fear and disgust, she reverently replaced\r\nthe covering, and went away to her own table, as her companion did\r\nto hers. And there for an hour they worked at their several problems,\r\nwithout speaking, but not without an awe of the presence there, \xe2\x80\x9cthe new\r\none,\xe2\x80\x9d and not without an awful sense of life itself, as they heard the\r\npulsations of the music and the light laughter from the dancing-hall.\r\n\r\nWhen, at length, they went away, and locked the dreadful room behind\r\nthem, and came out into the street, where people were passing, they, for\r\nthe first time, realized, in the relief they felt, what a nervous strain\r\nthey had been under.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nWhile Ruth was thus absorbed in her new occupation, and the spring was\r\nwearing away, Philip and his friends were still detained at the Southern\r\nHotel. The great contractors had concluded their business with the state\r\nand railroad officials and with the lesser contractors, and departed for\r\nthe East. But the serious illness of one of the engineers kept Philip\r\nand Henry in the city and occupied in alternate watchings.\r\n\r\nPhilip wrote to Ruth of the new acquaintance they had made, Col.\r\nSellers, an enthusiastic and hospitable gentleman, very much interested\r\nin the development of the country, and in their success. They had not\r\nhad an opportunity to visit at his place \xe2\x80\x9cup in the country\xe2\x80\x9d yet, but\r\nthe Colonel often dined with them, and in confidence, confided to them\r\nhis projects, and seemed to take a great liking to them, especially to\r\nhis friend Harry. It was true that he never seemed to have ready money,\r\nbut he was engaged in very large operations.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence was not very brisk between these two young persons,\r\nso differently occupied; for though Philip wrote long letters, he got\r\nbrief ones in reply, full of sharp little observations however, such as\r\none concerning Col. Sellers, namely, that such men dined at their house\r\nevery week.\r\n\r\nRuth's proposed occupation astonished Philip immensely, but while he\r\nargued it and discussed it, he did not dare hint to her his fear that\r\nit would interfere with his most cherished plans. He too sincerely\r\nrespected Ruth's judgment to make any protest, however, and he would\r\nhave defended her course against the world.\r\n\r\nThis enforced waiting at St. Louis was very irksome to Philip. His money\r\nwas running away, for one thing, and he longed to get into the field,\r\nand see for himself what chance there was for a fortune or even an\r\noccupation. The contractors had given the young men leave to join\r\nthe engineer corps as soon as they could, but otherwise had made\r\nno provision for them, and in fact had left them with only the most\r\nindefinite expectations of something large in the future.\r\n\r\nHarry was entirely happy; in his circumstances. He very soon knew\r\neverybody, from the governor of the state down to the waiters at the\r\nhotel. He had the Wall street slang at his tongue's end; he always\r\ntalked like a capitalist, and entered with enthusiasm into all the land\r\nand railway schemes with which the air was thick.\r\n\r\nCol. Sellers and Harry talked together by the hour and by the day. Harry\r\ninformed his new friend that he was going out with the engineer corps of\r\nthe Salt Lick Pacific Extension, but that wasn't his real business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm to have, with another party,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry, \xe2\x80\x9ca big contract in the\r\nroad, as soon as it is let; and, meantime, I'm with the engineers to spy\r\nout the best land and the depot sites.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's everything,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the Colonel, \xe2\x80\x9cin knowing where to\r\ninvest. I've known people throwaway their money because they were too\r\nconsequential to take Sellers' advice. Others, again, have made their\r\npile on taking it. I've looked over the ground; I've been studying it\r\nfor twenty years. You can't put your finger on a spot in the map of\r\nMissouri that I don't know as if I'd made it. When you want to place\r\nanything,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Colonel, confidently, \xe2\x80\x9cjust let Beriah Sellers\r\nknow. That's all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I haven't got much in ready money I can lay my hands on now, but if\r\na fellow could do anything with fifteen or twenty thousand dollars, as a\r\nbeginning, I shall draw for that when I see the right opening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that's something, that's something, fifteen or twenty thousand\r\ndollars, say twenty--as an advance,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel reflectively, as\r\nif turning over his mind for a project that could be entered on with\r\nsuch a trifling sum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll tell you what it is--but only to you Mr. Brierly, only to you,\r\nmind; I've got a little project that I've been keeping. It looks small,\r\nlooks small on paper, but it's got a big future. What should you say,\r\nsir, to a city, built up like the rod of Aladdin had touched it, built\r\nup in two years, where now you wouldn't expect it any more than you'd\r\nexpect a light-house on the top of Pilot Knob? and you could own the\r\nland! It can be done, sir. It can be done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel hitched up his chair close to Harry, laid his hand on his\r\nknee, and, first looking about him, said in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Salt Lick\r\nPacific Extension is going to run through Stone's Landing! The Almighty\r\nnever laid out a cleaner piece of level prairie for a city; and it's the\r\nnatural center of all that region of hemp and tobacco.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you think the road will go there? It's twenty miles, on the\r\nmap, off the straight line of the road?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can't tell what is the straight line till the engineers have been\r\nover it. Between us, I have talked with Jeff Thompson, the division\r\nengineer. He understands the wants of Stone's Landing, and the claims\r\nof the inhabitants--who are to be there. Jeff says that a railroad is\r\nfor--the accommodation of the people and not for the benefit of gophers;\r\nand if, he don't run this to Stone's Landing he'll be damned! You\r\nought to know Jeff; he's one of the most enthusiastic engineers in this\r\nwestern country, and one of the best fellows that ever looked through\r\nthe bottom of a glass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe recommendation was not undeserved. There was nothing that Jeff\r\nwouldn't do, to accommodate a friend, from sharing his last dollar with\r\nhim, to winging him in a duel. When he understood from Col. Sellers.\r\nhow the land lay at Stone's Landing, he cordially shook hands with that\r\ngentleman, asked him to drink, and fairly roared out, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, God bless\r\nmy soul, Colonel, a word from one Virginia gentleman to another is 'nuff\r\nced.' There's Stone's Landing been waiting for a railroad more than four\r\nthousand years, and damme if she shan't have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip had not so much faith as Harry in Stone's Landing, when the\r\nlatter opened the project to him, but Harry talked about it as if he\r\nalready owned that incipient city.\r\n\r\nHarry thoroughly believed in all his projects and inventions, and lived\r\nday by day in their golden atmosphere. Everybody liked the young fellow,\r\nfor how could they help liking one of such engaging manners and large\r\nfortune? The waiters at the hotel would do more for him than for any\r\nother guest, and he made a great many acquaintances among the people\r\nof St. Louis, who liked his sensible and liberal views about the\r\ndevelopment of the western country, and about St. Louis. He said it\r\nought to be the national capital. Harry made partial arrangements with\r\nseveral of the merchants for furnishing supplies for his contract on the\r\nSalt Lick Pacific Extension; consulted the maps with the engineers, and\r\nwent over the profiles with the contractors, figuring out estimates for\r\nbids. He was exceedingly busy with those things when he was not at\r\nthe bedside of his sick acquaintance, or arranging the details of his\r\nspeculation with Col. Sellers.\r\n\r\nMeantime the days went along and the weeks, and the money in Harry's\r\npocket got lower and lower. He was just as liberal with what he had as\r\nbefore, indeed it was his nature to be free with his money or with that\r\nof others, and he could lend or spend a dollar with an air that made it\r\nseem like ten. At length, at the end of one week, when his hotel bill\r\nwas presented, Harry found not a cent in his pocket to meet it. He\r\ncarelessly remarked to the landlord that he was not that day in\r\nfunds, but he would draw on New York, and he sat down and wrote to the\r\ncontractors in that city a glowing letter about the prospects of the\r\nroad, and asked them to advance a hundred or two, until he got at work.\r\nNo reply came. He wrote again, in an unoffended business like tone,\r\nsuggesting that he had better draw at three days. A short answer came to\r\nthis, simply saying that money was very tight in Wall street just then,\r\nand that he had better join the engineer corps as soon as he could.\r\n\r\nBut the bill had to be paid, and Harry took it to Philip, and asked him\r\nif he thought he hadn't better draw on his uncle. Philip had not much\r\nfaith in Harry's power of \xe2\x80\x9cdrawing,\xe2\x80\x9d and told him that he would pay the\r\nbill himself. Whereupon Harry dismissed the matter then and thereafter\r\nfrom his thoughts, and, like a light-hearted good fellow as he was, gave\r\nhimself no more trouble about his board-bills. Philip paid them, swollen\r\nas they were with a monstrous list of extras; but he seriously counted\r\nthe diminishing bulk of his own hoard, which was all the money he had in\r\nthe world. Had he not tacitly agreed to share with Harry to the last in\r\nthis adventure, and would not the generous fellow divide with him if he,\r\nPhilip, were in want and Harry had anything?\r\n\r\nThe fever at length got tired of tormenting the stout young engineer,\r\nwho lay sick at the hotel, and left him, very thin, a little sallow but\r\nan \xe2\x80\x9cacclimated\xe2\x80\x9d man. Everybody said he was \xe2\x80\x9cacclimated\xe2\x80\x9d now, and said it\r\ncheerfully. What it is to be acclimated to western fevers no two persons\r\nexactly agree.\r\n\r\nSome say it is a sort of vaccination that renders death by some\r\nmalignant type of fever less probable. Some regard it as a sort of\r\ninitiation, like that into the Odd Fellows, which renders one liable to\r\nhis regular dues thereafter. Others consider it merely the acquisition\r\nof a habit of taking every morning before breakfast a dose of bitters,\r\ncomposed of whiskey and assafoetida, out of the acclimation jug.\r\n\r\nJeff Thompson afterwards told Philip that he once asked Senator\r\nAtchison, then acting Vice-President of the United States, about the\r\npossibility of acclimation; he thought the opinion of the second officer\r\nof our great government would be valuable on this point. They were\r\nsitting together on a bench before a country tavern, in the free\r\nconverse permitted by our democratic habits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose, Senator, that you have become acclimated to this country?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Vice-President, crossing his legs, pulling his\r\nwide-awake down over his forehead, causing a passing chicken to\r\nhop quickly one side by the accuracy of his aim, and speaking with\r\nsenatorial deliberation, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I have. I've been here twenty-five\r\nyears, and dash, dash my dash to dash, if I haven't entertained\r\ntwenty-five separate and distinct earthquakes, one a year. The niggro is\r\nthe only person who can stand the fever and ague of this region.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe convalescence of the engineer was the signal for breaking up\r\nquarters at St. Louis, and the young fortune-hunters started up the\r\nriver in good spirits. It was only the second time either of them had\r\nbeen upon a Mississippi steamboat, and nearly everything they saw\r\nhad the charm of novelty. Col. Sellers was at the landing to bid them\r\ngood-bye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall send you up that basket of champagne by the next boat; no, no;\r\nno thanks; you'll find it not bad in camp,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried out as the plank\r\nwas hauled in. \xe2\x80\x9cMy respects to Thompson. Tell him to sight for Stone's.\r\nLet me know, Mr. Brierly, when you are ready to locate; I'll come over\r\nfrom Hawkeye. Goodbye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the last the young fellows saw of the Colonel, he was waving his\r\nhat, and beaming prosperity and good luck.\r\n\r\nThe voyage was delightful, and was not long enough to become monotonous.\r\nThe travelers scarcely had time indeed to get accustomed to the\r\nsplendors of the great saloon where the tables were spread for meals,\r\na marvel of paint and gilding, its ceiling hung with fancifully cut\r\ntissue-paper of many colors, festooned and arranged in endless patterns.\r\nThe whole was more beautiful than a barber's shop. The printed bill\r\nof fare at dinner was longer and more varied, the proprietors justly\r\nboasted, than that of any hotel in New York. It must have been the work\r\nof an author of talent and imagination, and it surely was not his fault\r\nif the dinner itself was to a certain extent a delusion, and if the\r\nguests got something that tasted pretty much the same whatever dish they\r\nordered; nor was it his fault if a general flavor of rose in all the\r\ndessert dishes suggested that they had passed through the barber's\r\nsaloon on their way from the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThe travelers landed at a little settlement on the left bank, and at\r\nonce took horses for the camp in the interior, carrying their clothes\r\nand blankets strapped behind the saddles. Harry was dressed as we have\r\nseen him once before, and his long and shining boots attracted not\r\na little the attention of the few persons they met on the road, and\r\nespecially of the bright faced wenches who lightly stepped along the\r\nhighway, picturesque in their colored kerchiefs, carrying light baskets,\r\nor riding upon mules and balancing before them a heavier load.\r\n\r\nHarry sang fragments of operas and talked about their fortune. Philip\r\neven was excited by the sense of freedom and adventure, and the beauty\r\nof the landscape. The prairie, with its new grass and unending acres of\r\nbrilliant flowers--chiefly the innumerable varieties of phlox--bore the\r\nlook of years of cultivation, and the occasional open groves of white\r\noaks gave it a park-like appearance. It was hardly unreasonable to\r\nexpect to see at any moment, the gables and square windows of an\r\nElizabethan mansion in one of the well kept groves.\r\n\r\nTowards sunset of the third day, when the young gentlemen thought they\r\nought to be near the town of Magnolia, near which they had been directed\r\nto find the engineers' camp, they descried a log house and drew up\r\nbefore it to enquire the way. Half the building was store, and half was\r\ndwelling house. At the door of the latter stood a negress with a bright\r\nturban on her head, to whom Philip called,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you tell me, auntie, how far it is to the town of Magnolia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, bress you chile,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the woman, \xe2\x80\x9cyou's dere now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was true. This log house was the compactly built town, and all\r\ncreation was its suburbs. The engineers' camp was only two or three\r\nmiles distant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou's boun' to find it,\xe2\x80\x9d directed auntie, \xe2\x80\x9cif you don't keah nuffin\r\n'bout de road, and go fo' de sun-down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA brisk gallop brought the riders in sight of the twinkling light of\r\nthe camp, just as the stars came out. It lay in a little hollow, where\r\na small stream ran through a sparse grove of young white oaks. A half\r\ndozen tents were pitched under the trees, horses and oxen were corraled\r\nat a little distance, and a group of men sat on camp stools or lay on\r\nblankets about a bright fire. The twang of a banjo became audible\r\nas they drew nearer, and they saw a couple of negroes, from some\r\nneighboring plantation, \xe2\x80\x9cbreaking down\xe2\x80\x9d a juba in approved style, amid\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9chi, hi's\xe2\x80\x9d of the spectators.\r\n\r\nMr. Jeff Thompson, for it was the camp of this redoubtable engineer,\r\ngave the travelers a hearty welcome, offered them ground room in his\r\nown tent, ordered supper, and set out a small jug, a drop from which he\r\ndeclared necessary on account of the chill of the evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw an Eastern man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeff, \xe2\x80\x9cwho knew how to drink from\r\na jug with one hand. It's as easy as lying. So.\xe2\x80\x9d He grasped the handle\r\nwith the right hand, threw the jug back upon his arm, and applied\r\nhis lips to the nozzle. It was an act as graceful as it was simple.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Thompson, setting it down, \xe2\x80\x9cit puts every man on his\r\nhonor as to quantity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEarly to turn in was the rule of the camp, and by nine o'clock everybody\r\nwas under his blanket, except Jeff himself, who worked awhile at his\r\ntable over his field-book, and then arose, stepped outside the tent\r\ndoor and sang, in a strong and not unmelodious tenor, the Star Spangled\r\nBanner from beginning to end. It proved to be his nightly practice to\r\nlet off the unexpended steam of his conversational powers, in the words\r\nof this stirring song.\r\n\r\nIt was a long time before Philip got to sleep. He saw the fire light,\r\nhe saw the clear stars through the tree-tops, he heard the gurgle of the\r\nstream, the stamp of the horses, the occasional barking of the dog which\r\nfollowed the cook's wagon, the hooting of an owl; and when these failed\r\nhe saw Jeff, standing on a battlement, mid the rocket's red glare, and\r\nheard him sing, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, say, can you see?\xe2\x80\x9d It was the first time he had\r\never slept on the ground.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n     ----\xe2\x80\x9cWe have view'd it,\r\n     And measur'd it within all, by the scale\r\n     The richest tract of land, love, in the kingdom!\r\n     There will be made seventeen or eighteeen millions,\r\n     Or more, as't may be handled!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Devil is an Ass.\r\n\r\nNobody dressed more like an engineer than Mr. Henry Brierly. The\r\ncompleteness of his appointments was the envy of the corps, and the\r\ngay fellow himself was the admiration of the camp servants, axemen,\r\nteamsters and cooks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon you didn't git them boots no wher's this side o' Sent Louis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n queried the tall Missouri youth who acted as commissary's assistant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, New York.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYas, I've heern o' New York,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the butternut lad, attentively\r\nstudying each item of Harry's dress, and endeavoring to cover his design\r\nwith interesting conversation. \xe2\x80\x9c'N there's Massachusetts.\xe2\x80\x9d,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's not far off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI've heern Massachusetts was a-----of a place. Les, see, what state's\r\nMassachusetts in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMassachusetts,\xe2\x80\x9d kindly replied Harry, \xe2\x80\x9cis in the state of Boston.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbolish'n wan't it? They must a cost right smart,\xe2\x80\x9d referring to the\r\nboots.\r\n\r\nHarry shouldered his rod and went to the field, tramped over the prairie\r\nby day, and figured up results at night, with the utmost cheerfulness\r\nand industry, and plotted the line on the profile paper, without,\r\nhowever, the least idea of engineering practical or theoretical. Perhaps\r\nthere was not a great deal of scientific knowledge in the entire corps,\r\nnor was very much needed. They were making, what is called a preliminary\r\nsurvey, and the chief object of a preliminary survey was to get up an\r\nexcitement about the road, to interest every town in that part of the\r\nstate in it, under the belief that the road would run through it, and to\r\nget the aid of every planter upon the prospect that a station would be\r\non his land.\r\n\r\nMr. Jeff Thompson was the most popular engineer who could be found\r\nfor this work. He did not bother himself much about details or\r\npracticabilities of location, but ran merrily along, sighting from the\r\ntop of one divide to the top of another, and striking \xe2\x80\x9cplumb\xe2\x80\x9d every town\r\nsite and big plantation within twenty or thirty miles of his route. In\r\nhis own language he \xe2\x80\x9cjust went booming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis course gave Harry an opportunity, as he said, to learn the\r\npractical details of engineering, and it gave Philip a chance to see the\r\ncountry, and to judge for himself what prospect of a fortune it offered.\r\nBoth he and Harry got the \xe2\x80\x9crefusal\xe2\x80\x9d of more than one plantation as they\r\nwent along, and wrote urgent letters to their eastern correspondents,\r\nupon the beauty of the land and the certainty that it would quadruple in\r\nvalue as soon as the road was finally located. It seemed strange to them\r\nthat capitalists did not flock out there and secure this land.\r\n\r\nThey had not been in the field over two weeks when Harry wrote to his\r\nfriend Col. Sellers that he'd better be on the move, for the line was\r\ncertain to go to Stone's Landing. Any one who looked at the line on\r\nthe map, as it was laid down from day to day, would have been uncertain\r\nwhich way it was going; but Jeff had declared that in his judgment the\r\nonly practicable route from the point they then stood on was to follow\r\nthe divide to Stone's Landing, and it was generally understood that that\r\ntown would be the next one hit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe'll make it, boys,\xe2\x80\x9d said the chief, \xe2\x80\x9cif we have to go in a balloon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd make it they did. In less than a week, this indomitable engineer had\r\ncarried his moving caravan over slues and branches, across bottoms and\r\nalong divides, and pitched his tents in the very heart of the city of\r\nStone's Landing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I'll be dashed,\xe2\x80\x9d was heard the cheery voice of Mr. Thompson, as\r\nhe stepped outside the tent door at sunrise next morning. \xe2\x80\x9cIf this don't\r\nget me. I say, yon Grayson, get out your sighting iron and see if you\r\ncan find old Sellers' town. Blame me if we wouldn't have run plumb by it\r\nif twilight had held on a little longer. Oh! Sterling, Brierly, get up\r\nand see the city. There's a steamboat just coming round the bend.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nJeff roared with laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe mayor'll be round here to breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fellows turned out of the tents, rubbing their eyes, and stared\r\nabout them. They were camped on the second bench of the narrow bottom of\r\na crooked, sluggish stream, that was some five rods wide in the present\r\ngood stage of water. Before them were a dozen log cabins, with stick\r\nand mud chimneys, irregularly disposed on either side of a not very\r\nwell defined road, which did not seem to know its own mind exactly, and,\r\nafter straggling through the town, wandered off over the rolling prairie\r\nin an uncertain way, as if it had started for nowhere and was quite\r\nlikely to reach its destination. Just as it left the town, however, it\r\nwas cheered and assisted by a guide-board, upon which was the legend \xe2\x80\x9c10\r\nMils to Hawkeye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe road had never been made except by the travel over it, and at this\r\nseason--the rainy June--it was a way of ruts cut in the black soil, and\r\nof fathomless mud-holes. In the principal street of the city, it had\r\nreceived more attention; for hogs, great and small, rooted about in\r\nit and wallowed in it, turning the street into a liquid quagmire which\r\ncould only be crossed on pieces of plank thrown here and there.\r\n\r\nAbout the chief cabin, which was the store and grocery of this mart of\r\ntrade, the mud was more liquid than elsewhere, and the rude platform\r\nin front of it and the dry-goods boxes mounted thereon were places\r\nof refuge for all the loafers of the place. Down by the stream was a\r\ndilapidated building which served for a hemp warehouse, and a shaky\r\nwharf extended out from it, into the water. In fact a flat-boat was\r\nthere moored by it, it's setting poles lying across the gunwales. Above\r\nthe town the stream was crossed by a crazy wooden bridge, the supports\r\nof which leaned all ways in the soggy soil; the absence of a plank here\r\nand there in the flooring made the crossing of the bridge faster than a\r\nwalk an offense not necessary to be prohibited by law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeff, \xe2\x80\x9cis Columbus River, alias Goose Run. If it\r\nwas widened, and deepened, and straightened, and made, long enough, it\r\nwould be one of the finest rivers in the western country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the sun rose and sent his level beams along the stream, the thin\r\nstratum of mist, or malaria, rose also and dispersed, but the light was\r\nnot able to enliven the dull water nor give any hint of its apparently\r\nfathomless depth. Venerable mud-turtles crawled up and roosted upon the\r\nold logs in the stream, their backs glistening in the sun, the first\r\ninhabitants of the metropolis to begin the active business of the day.\r\n\r\nIt was not long, however, before smoke began to issue from the city\r\nchimneys; and before the engineers had finished their breakfast they\r\nwere the object of the curious inspection of six or eight boys and men,\r\nwho lounged into the camp and gazed about them with languid interest,\r\ntheir hands in their pockets every one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning; gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d called out the chief engineer, from the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood mawning,\xe2\x80\x9d drawled out the spokesman of the party. \xe2\x80\x9cI allow\r\nthish-yers the railroad, I heern it was a-comin'.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, this is the railroad; all but the rails and the ironhorse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon you kin git all the rails you want oaten my white oak timber\r\nover, thar,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the first speaker, who appeared to be a man of\r\nproperty and willing to strike up a trade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'll have to negotiate with the contractors about the rails, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Jeff; \xe2\x80\x9chere's Mr. Brierly, I've no doubt would like to buy your\r\nrails when the time comes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought maybe you'd fetch the whole bilin along\r\nwith you. But if you want rails, I've got em, haint I Eph.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eph, without taking his eyes off the group at the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Thompson, rising from his seat and moving towards his\r\ntent, \xe2\x80\x9cthe railroad has come to Stone's Landing, sure; I move we take a\r\ndrink on it all round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe proposal met with universal favor. Jeff gave prosperity to Stone's\r\nLanding and navigation to Goose Run, and the toast was washed down with\r\ngusto, in the simple fluid of corn; and with the return compliment that\r\na rail road was a good thing, and that Jeff Thompson was no slouch.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o'clock a horse and wagon was descried making a slow approach\r\nto the camp over the prairie. As it drew near, the wagon was seen to\r\ncontain a portly gentleman, who hitched impatiently forward on his seat,\r\nshook the reins and gently touched up his horse, in the vain attempt to\r\ncommunicate his own energy to that dull beast, and looked eagerly at the\r\ntents. When the conveyance at length drew up to Mr. Thompson's door, the\r\ngentleman descended with great deliberation, straightened himself\r\nup, rubbed his hands, and beaming satisfaction from every part of his\r\nradiant frame, advanced to the group that was gathered to welcome him,\r\nand which had saluted him by name as soon as he came within hearing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome to Napoleon, gentlemen, welcome. I am proud to see you here Mr.\r\nThompson. You are, looking well Mr. Sterling. This is the country, sir.\r\nRight glad to see you Mr. Brierly. You got that basket of champagne? No?\r\nThose blasted river thieves! I'll never send anything more by 'em. The\r\nbest brand, Roederer. The last I had in my cellar, from a lot sent me\r\nby Sir George Gore--took him out on a buffalo hunt, when he visited our\r\ncountry. Is always sending me some trifle. You haven't looked about any\r\nyet, gentlemen? It's in the rough yet, in the rough. Those buildings\r\nwill all have to come down. That's the place for the public square,\r\nCourt House, hotels, churches, jail--all that sort of thing. About where\r\nwe stand, the deepo. How does that strike your engineering eye, Mr.\r\nThompson? Down yonder the business streets, running to the wharves. The\r\nUniversity up there, on rising ground, sightly place, see the river for\r\nmiles. That's Columbus river, only forty-nine miles to the Missouri. You\r\nsee what it is, placid, steady, no current to interfere with navigation,\r\nwants widening in places and dredging, dredge out the harbor and raise\r\na levee in front of the town; made by nature on purpose for a mart. Look\r\nat all this country, not another building within ten miles, no other\r\nnavigable stream, lay of the land points right here; hemp, tobacco,\r\ncorn, must come here. The railroad will do it, Napoleon won't know\r\nitself in a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't now evidently,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip aside to Harry. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you breakfasted\r\nColonel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHastily. Cup of coffee. Can't trust any coffee I don't import\r\nmyself. But I put up a basket of provisions,--wife would put in a few\r\ndelicacies, women always will, and a half dozen of that Burgundy, I was\r\ntelling you of Mr. Briefly. By the way, you never got to dine with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n And the Colonel strode away to the wagon and looked under the seat for\r\nthe basket.\r\n\r\nApparently it was not there. For the Colonel raised up the flap, looked\r\nin front and behind, and then exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound it. That comes of not doing a thing yourself. I trusted to the\r\nwomen folks to set that basket in the wagon, and it ain't there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe camp cook speedily prepared a savory breakfast for the Colonel,\r\nbroiled chicken, eggs, corn-bread, and coffee, to which he did ample\r\njustice, and topped off with a drop of Old Bourbon, from Mr. Thompson's\r\nprivate store, a brand which he said he knew well, he should think it\r\ncame from his own sideboard.\r\n\r\nWhile the engineer corps went to the field, to run back a couple of\r\nmiles and ascertain, approximately, if a road could ever get down to the\r\nLanding, and to sight ahead across the Run, and see if it could ever get\r\nout again, Col. Sellers and Harry sat down and began to roughly map out\r\nthe city of Napoleon on a large piece of drawing paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI've got the refusal of a mile square here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel, \xe2\x80\x9cin\r\nour names, for a year, with a quarter interest reserved for the four\r\nowners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey laid out the town liberally, not lacking room, leaving space\r\nfor the railroad to come in, and for the river as it was to be when\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nThe engineers reported that the railroad could come in, by taking a\r\nlittle sweep and crossing the stream on a high bridge, but the grades\r\nwould be steep. Col. Sellers said he didn't care so much about the\r\ngrades, if the road could only be made to reach the elevators on the\r\nriver. The next day Mr. Thompson made a hasty survey of the stream for a\r\nmile or two, so that the Colonel and Harry were enabled to show on\r\ntheir map how nobly that would accommodate the city. Jeff took a little\r\nwriting from the Colonel and Harry for a prospective share but Philip\r\ndeclined to join in, saying that he had no money, and didn't want to\r\nmake engagements he couldn't fulfill.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the camp moved on, followed till it was out of sight\r\nby the listless eyes of the group in front of the store, one of whom\r\nremarked that, \xe2\x80\x9che'd be doggoned if he ever expected to see that\r\nrailroad any mo'.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry went with the Colonel to Hawkeye to complete their arrangements,\r\na part of which was the preparation of a petition to congress for the\r\nimprovement of the navigation of Columbus River.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nEight years have passed since the death of Mr. Hawkins. Eight years are\r\nnot many in the life of a nation or the history of a state, but they may\r\nbe years of destiny that shall fix the current of the century following.\r\nSuch years were those that followed the little scrimmage on Lexington\r\nCommon. Such years were those that followed the double-shotted demand\r\nfor the surrender of Fort Sumter. History is never done with inquiring\r\nof these years, and summoning witnesses about them, and trying to\r\nunderstand their significance.\r\n\r\nThe eight years in America from 1860 to 1868 uprooted institutions that\r\nwere centuries old, changed the politics of a people, transformed the\r\nsocial life of half the country, and wrought so profoundly upon the\r\nentire national character that the influence cannot be measured short of\r\ntwo or three generations.\r\n\r\nAs we are accustomed to interpret the economy of providence, the life of\r\nthe individual is as nothing to that of the nation or the race; but who\r\ncan say, in the broader view and the more intelligent weight of values,\r\nthat the life of one man is not more than that of a nationality, and\r\nthat there is not a tribunal where the tragedy of one human soul shall\r\nnot seem more significant than the overturning of any human institution\r\nwhatever?\r\n\r\nWhen one thinks of the tremendous forces of the upper and the nether\r\nworld which play for the mastery of the soul of a woman during the few\r\nyears in which she passes from plastic girlhood to the ripe maturity of\r\nwomanhood, he may well stand in awe before the momentous drama.\r\n\r\nWhat capacities she has of purity, tenderness, goodness; what capacities\r\nof vileness, bitterness and evil. Nature must needs be lavish with the\r\nmother and creator of men, and centre in her all the possibilities of\r\nlife. And a few critical years can decide whether her life is to be\r\nfull of sweetness and light, whether she is to be the vestal of a holy\r\ntemple, or whether she will be the fallen priestess of a desecrated\r\nshrine. There are women, it is true, who seem to be capable neither of\r\nrising much nor of falling much, and whom a conventional life saves from\r\nany special development of character.\r\n\r\nBut Laura was not one of them. She had the fatal gift of beauty, and\r\nthat more fatal gift which does not always accompany mere beauty, the\r\npower of fascination, a power that may, indeed, exist without beauty.\r\nShe had will, and pride and courage and ambition, and she was left to\r\nbe very much her own guide at the age when romance comes to the aid of\r\npassion, and when the awakening powers of her vigorous mind had little\r\nobject on which to discipline themselves.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous conflict that was fought in this girl's soul none of\r\nthose about her knew, and very few knew that her life had in it anything\r\nunusual or romantic or strange.\r\n\r\nThose were troublous days in Hawkeye as well as in most other Missouri\r\ntowns, days of confusion, when between Unionist and Confederate\r\noccupations, sudden maraudings and bush-whackings and raids, individuals\r\nescaped observation or comment in actions that would have filled the\r\ntown with scandal in quiet times.\r\n\r\nFortunately we only need to deal with Laura's life at this period\r\nhistorically, and look back upon such portions of it as will serve to\r\nreveal the woman as she was at the time of the arrival of Mr. Harry\r\nBrierly in Hawkeye.\r\n\r\nThe Hawkins family were settled there, and had a hard enough struggle\r\nwith poverty and the necessity of keeping up appearances in accord\r\nwith their own family pride and the large expectations they secretly\r\ncherished of a fortune in the Knobs of East Tennessee. How pinched they\r\nwere perhaps no one knew but Clay, to whom they looked for almost their\r\nwhole support. Washington had been in Hawkeye off and on, attracted away\r\noccasionally by some tremendous speculation, from which he invariably\r\nreturned to Gen. Boswell's office as poor as he went. He was the\r\ninventor of no one knew how many useless contrivances, which were not\r\nworth patenting, and his years had been passed in dreaming and planning\r\nto no purpose; until he was now a man of about thirty, without a\r\nprofession or a permanent occupation, a tall, brown-haired, dreamy\r\nperson of the best intentions and the frailest resolution. Probably\r\nhowever the eight years had been happier to him than to any others in\r\nhis circle, for the time had been mostly spent in a blissful dream of\r\nthe coming of enormous wealth.\r\n\r\nHe went out with a company from Hawkeye to the war, and was not wanting\r\nin courage, but he would have been a better soldier if he had been less\r\nengaged in contrivances for circumventing the enemy by strategy unknown\r\nto the books.\r\n\r\nIt happened to him to be captured in one of his self-appointed\r\nexpeditions, but the federal colonel released him, after a short\r\nexamination, satisfied that he could most injure the confederate forces\r\nopposed to the Unionists by returning him to his regiment. Col. Sellers\r\nwas of course a prominent man during the war. He was captain of the home\r\nguards in Hawkeye, and he never left home except upon one occasion, when\r\non the strength of a rumor, he executed a flank movement and fortified\r\nStone's Landing, a place which no one unacquainted with the country\r\nwould be likely to find.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel afterwards, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Landing is the key to upper\r\nMissouri, and it is the only place the enemy never captured. If other\r\nplaces had been defended as well as that was, the result would have been\r\ndifferent, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel had his own theories about war as he had in other things. If\r\neverybody had stayed at home as he did, he said, the South never would\r\nhave been conquered. For what would there have been to conquer? Mr.\r\nJeff Davis was constantly writing him to take command of a corps in the\r\nconfederate army, but Col. Sellers said, no, his duty was at home. And\r\nhe was by no means idle. He was the inventor of the famous air torpedo,\r\nwhich came very near destroying the Union armies in Missouri, and the\r\ncity of St. Louis itself.\r\n\r\nHis plan was to fill a torpedo with Greek fire and poisonous and deadly\r\nmissiles, attach it to a balloon, and then let it sail away over the\r\nhostile camp and explode at the right moment, when the time-fuse burned\r\nout. He intended to use this invention in the capture of St. Louis,\r\nexploding his torpedoes over the city, and raining destruction upon it\r\nuntil the army of occupation would gladly capitulate. He was unable to\r\nprocure the Greek fire, but he constructed a vicious torpedo which would\r\nhave answered the purpose, but the first one prematurely exploded in his\r\nwood-house, blowing it clean away, and setting fire to his house. The\r\nneighbors helped him put out the conflagration, but they discouraged any\r\nmore experiments of that sort.\r\n\r\nThe patriotic old gentleman, however, planted so much powder and so\r\nmany explosive contrivances in the roads leading into Hawkeye, and then\r\nforgot the exact spots of danger, that people were afraid to travel\r\nthe highways, and used to come to town across the fields. The Colonel's\r\nmotto was, \xe2\x80\x9cMillions for defence but not one cent for tribute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Laura came to Hawkeye she might have forgotten the annoyances of\r\nthe gossips of Murpheysburg and have out lived the bitterness that was\r\ngrowing in her heart, if she had been thrown less upon herself, or if\r\nthe surroundings of her life had been more congenial and helpful.\r\nBut she had little society, less and less as she grew older that was\r\ncongenial to her, and her mind preyed upon itself; and the mystery of\r\nher birth at once chagrined her and raised in her the most extravagant\r\nexpectations. She was proud and she felt the sting of poverty. She could\r\nnot but be conscious of her beauty also, and she was vain of that, and\r\ncame to take a sort of delight in the exercise of her fascinations upon\r\nthe rather loutish young men who came in her way and whom she despised.\r\n\r\nThere was another world opened to her--a world of books. But it was not\r\nthe best world of that sort, for the small libraries she had access to\r\nin Hawkeye were decidedly miscellaneous, and largely made up of romances\r\nand fictions which fed her imagination with the most exaggerated notions\r\nof life, and showed her men and women in a very false sort of heroism.\r\nFrom these stories she learned what a woman of keen intellect and some\r\nculture joined to beauty and fascination of manner, might expect to\r\naccomplish in society as she read of it; and along with these ideas she\r\nimbibed other very crude ones in regard to the emancipation of woman.\r\n\r\nThere were also other books--histories, biographies of distinguished\r\npeople, travels in far lands, poems, especially those of Byron, Scott\r\nand Shelley and Moore, which she eagerly absorbed, and appropriated\r\ntherefrom what was to her liking. Nobody in Hawkeye had read so much\r\nor, after a fashion, studied so diligently as Laura. She passed for an\r\naccomplished girl, and no doubt thought herself one, as she was, judged\r\nby any standard near her.\r\n\r\nDuring the war there came to Hawkeye a confederate officer, Col. Selby,\r\nwho was stationed there for a time, in command of that district. He was\r\na handsome, soldierly man of thirty years, a graduate of the University\r\nof Virginia, and of distinguished family, if his story might be\r\nbelieved, and, it was evident, a man of the world and of extensive\r\ntravel and adventure.\r\n\r\nTo find in such an out of the way country place a woman like Laura was\r\na piece of good luck upon which Col. Selby congratulated himself. He was\r\nstudiously polite to her and treated her with a consideration to which\r\nshe was unaccustomed. She had read of such men, but she had never seen\r\none before, one so high-bred, so noble in sentiment, so entertaining in\r\nconversation, so engaging in manner.\r\n\r\nIt is a long story; unfortunately it is an old story, and it need not\r\nbe dwelt on. Laura loved him, and believed that his love for her was as\r\npure and deep as her own. She worshipped him and would have counted her\r\nlife a little thing to give him, if he would only love her and let her\r\nfeed the hunger of her heart upon him.\r\n\r\nThe passion possessed her whole being, and lifted her up, till she\r\nseemed to walk on air. It was all true, then, the romances she had read,\r\nthe bliss of love she had dreamed of. Why had she never noticed before\r\nhow blithesome the world was, how jocund with love; the birds sang it,\r\nthe trees whispered it to her as she passed, the very flowers beneath\r\nher feet strewed the way as for a bridal march.\r\n\r\nWhen the Colonel went away they were engaged to be married, as soon as\r\nhe could make certain arrangements which he represented to be necessary,\r\nand quit the army. He wrote to her from Harding, a small town in the\r\nsouthwest corner of the state, saying that he should be held in the\r\nservice longer than he had expected, but that it would not be more than\r\na few months, then he should be at liberty to take her to Chicago where\r\nhe had property, and should have business, either now or as soon as the\r\nwar was over, which he thought could not last long. Meantime why should\r\nthey be separated? He was established in comfortable quarters, and if\r\nshe could find company and join him, they would be married, and gain so\r\nmany more months of happiness.\r\n\r\nWas woman ever prudent when she loved? Laura went to Harding, the\r\nneighbors supposed to nurse Washington who had fallen ill there. Her\r\nengagement was, of course, known in Hawkeye, and was indeed a matter\r\nof pride to her family. Mrs. Hawkins would have told the first inquirer\r\nthat. Laura had gone to be married; but Laura had cautioned her; she did\r\nnot want to be thought of, she said, as going in search of a husband;\r\nlet the news come back after she was married.\r\n\r\nSo she traveled to Harding on the pretence we have mentioned, and was\r\nmarried. She was married, but something must have happened on that very\r\nday or the next that alarmed her. Washington did not know then or after\r\nwhat it was, but Laura bound him not to send news of her marriage to\r\nHawkeye yet, and to enjoin her mother not to speak of it. Whatever cruel\r\nsuspicion or nameless dread this was, Laura tried bravely to put it\r\naway, and not let it cloud her happiness.\r\n\r\nCommunication that summer, as may be imagined, was neither regular nor\r\nfrequent between the remote confederate camp at Harding and Hawkeye,\r\nand Laura was in a measure lost sight of--indeed, everyone had troubles\r\nenough of his own without borrowing from his neighbors.\r\n\r\nLaura had given herself utterly to her husband, and if he had faults,\r\nif he was selfish, if he was sometimes coarse, if he was dissipated, she\r\ndid not or would not see it. It was the passion of her life, the time\r\nwhen her whole nature went to flood tide and swept away all barriers.\r\nWas her husband ever cold or indifferent? She shut her eyes to\r\neverything but her sense of possession of her idol.\r\n\r\nThree months passed. One morning her husband informed her that he had\r\nbeen ordered South, and must go within two hours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can be ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said Laura, cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can't take you. You must go back to Hawkeye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan't-take-me?\xe2\x80\x9d Laura asked, with wonder in her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI can't live\r\nwithout you. You said-----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO bother what I said,\xe2\x80\x9d--and the Colonel took up his sword to buckle it\r\non, and then continued coolly, \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact is Laura, our romance is played\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura heard, but she did not comprehend. She caught his arm and cried,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge, how can you joke so cruelly? I will go any where with you. I\r\nwill wait any where. I can't go back to Hawkeye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go where you like. Perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he with a sneer, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nwould do as well to wait here, for another colonel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura's brain whirled. She did not yet comprehend. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this mean?\r\nWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt means,\xe2\x80\x9d said the officer, in measured words, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you haven't\r\nanything to show for a legal marriage, and that I am going to New\r\nOrleans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's a lie, George, it's a lie. I am your wife. I shall go. I shall\r\nfollow you to New Orleans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps my wife might not like it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura raised her head, her eyes flamed with fire, she tried to utter a\r\ncry, and fell senseless on the floor.\r\n\r\nWhen she came to herself the Colonel was gone. Washington Hawkins stood\r\nat her bedside. Did she come to herself? Was there anything left in her\r\nheart but hate and bitterness, a sense of an infamous wrong at the hands\r\nof the only man she had ever loved?\r\n\r\nShe returned to Hawkeye. With the exception of Washington and his\r\nmother, no one knew what had happened. The neighbors supposed that the\r\nengagement with Col. Selby had fallen through. Laura was ill for a\r\nlong time, but she recovered; she had that resolution in her that could\r\nconquer death almost. And with her health came back her beauty, and an\r\nadded fascination, a something that might be mistaken for sadness. Is\r\nthere a beauty in the knowledge of evil, a beauty that shines out in\r\nthe face of a person whose inward life is transformed by some terrible\r\nexperience? Is the pathos in the eyes of the Beatrice Cenci from her\r\nguilt or her innocence?\r\n\r\nLaura was not much changed. The lovely woman had a devil in her heart.\r\nThat was all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 3.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX Harry Brierly Infatuated With Laura and Proposes She Visit\r\nWashington\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX Senator Abner Dilwortliy Visits Hawkeye--Addresses the People\r\nand Makes the Acquaintance of Laura 186\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI Ruth Bolton at Fallkill Seminary--The Montagues--Ruth\r\nBecomes Quite Gay--Alice Montague\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII Philip and Harry Visit Fallkill--Harry Does the Agreeable\r\nto Ruth\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII Harry at Washington Lobbying For An Appropriation For\r\nStone's Landing --Philip in New York Studying Engineering\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV Washington and Its Sights--The Appropriation Bill Reported\r\nFrom the Committee and Passed\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV Energetic Movements at Stone's Landing--Everything\r\nBooming--A Grand Smash Up\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI The Boltons--Ruth at Home--Visitors and Speculations\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII Col Sellers Comforts His Wife With His Views on the\r\nProspects\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n64.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0NOT EASILY REFERRED 65.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ORDER, GENTLEMEN 66.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0THE SENATOR'S WALK\r\n67.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0RESIDENCE OF SQUIRE MONTAGUE 68.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0INSIDE THE MANSION 69.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0RUTH\r\nDISSIPATING 70.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0TAIL PIECE 71.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ANTICIPATION 72.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0REALITY 73.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0PHILIP\r\nHEARS HARRY ENTERTAINING RUTH 74.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AN ENTERTAINING FELLOW 75.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0HARRY\r\nEXPLAINS BEFORE SENATE COMMITTEE 76.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0PHILIP STUDYING 77.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cKEEP OUT\r\nOF HERE, SIR!\xe2\x80\x9d 78.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AN OLD ONE 79.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A PROMENADE OUTFIT 80.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0REARED BY\r\nA GRATEFUL COUNTRY 81.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0BENEFIT OF POLITICAL INFLUENCE 82.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0TAIL PIECE\r\n83.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0VISIONS OF A HAPPY MAN 84.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0EXODUS OF THE NATIVES 85.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0HARRY\r\nBRIERLY FLIES FROM THE MOB 86.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ENJOYING THE BONFIRE 87.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0BROTHER PLUM\r\n88.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0RUTH AT HOME 89.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MAP OF THE SALT LICK BRANCH OF THE PACIFIC R. R.\r\n90.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0RESULT OF A STRAIGHT LINE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nMr. Harry Brierly drew his pay as an engineer while he was living at the\r\nCity Hotel in Hawkeye. Mr. Thompson had been kind enough to say that\r\nit didn't make any difference whether he was with the corps or not; and\r\nalthough Harry protested to the Colonel daily and to Washington Hawkins\r\nthat he must go back at once to the line and superintend the lay-out\r\nwith reference to his contract, yet he did not go, but wrote instead\r\nlong letters to Philip, instructing him to keep his eye out, and to let\r\nhim know when any difficulty occurred that required his presence.\r\n\r\nMeantime Harry blossomed out in the society of Hawkeye, as he did in any\r\nsociety where fortune cast him and he had the slightest opportunity to\r\nexpand. Indeed the talents of a rich and accomplished young fellow\r\nlike Harry were not likely to go unappreciated in such a place. A land\r\noperator, engaged in vast speculations, a favorite in the select circles\r\nof New York, in correspondence with brokers and bankers, intimate with\r\npublic men at Washington, one who could play the guitar and touch\r\nthe banjo lightly, and who had an eye for a pretty girl, and knew the\r\nlanguage of flattery, was welcome everywhere in Hawkeye. Even Miss Laura\r\nHawkins thought it worth while to use her fascinations upon him, and\r\nto endeavor to entangle the volatile fellow in the meshes of her\r\nattractions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGad,\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry to the Colonel, \xe2\x80\x9cshe's a superb creature, she'd make a\r\nstir in New York, money or no money. There are men I know would give her\r\na railroad or an opera house, or whatever she wanted--at least they'd\r\npromise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry had a way of looking at women as he looked at anything else in the\r\nworld he wanted, and he half resolved to appropriate Miss Laura, during\r\nhis stay in Hawkeye. Perhaps the Colonel divined his thoughts, or was\r\noffended at Harry's talk, for he replied,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo nonsense, Mr. Brierly. Nonsense won't do in Hawkeye, not with my\r\nfriends. The Hawkins' blood is good blood, all the way from Tennessee.\r\nThe Hawkinses are under the weather now, but their Tennessee property is\r\nmillions when it comes into market.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, Colonel. Not the least offense intended. But you can see she\r\nis a fascinating woman. I was only thinking, as to this appropriation,\r\nnow, what such a woman could do in Washington. All correct, too,\r\nall correct. Common thing, I assure you in Washington; the wives of\r\nsenators, representatives, cabinet officers, all sorts of wives, and\r\nsome who are not wives, use their influence. You want an appointment? Do\r\nyou go to Senator X? Not much. You get on the right side of his wife.\r\nIs it an appropriation? You'd go straight to the Committee, or to the\r\nInterior office, I suppose? You'd learn better than that. It takes a\r\nwoman to get any thing through the Land Office: I tell you, Miss Laura\r\nwould fascinate an appropriation right through the Senate and the House\r\nof Representatives in one session, if she was in Washington, as your\r\nfriend, Colonel, of course as your friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you have her sign our petition?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Colonel, innocently.\r\n\r\nHarry laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWomen don't get anything by petitioning Congress; nobody\r\ndoes, that's for form. Petitions are referred somewhere, and that's the\r\nlast of them; you can't refer a handsome woman so easily, when she is\r\npresent. They prefer 'em mostly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe petition however was elaborately drawn up, with a glowing\r\ndescription of Napoleon and the adjacent country, and a statement of the\r\nabsolute necessity to the prosperity of that region and of one of the\r\nstations on the great through route to the Pacific, of the immediate\r\nimprovement of Columbus River; to this was appended a map of the city\r\nand a survey of the river. It was signed by all the people at Stone's\r\nLanding who could write their names, by Col. Beriah Sellers, and\r\nthe Colonel agreed to have the names headed by all the senators and\r\nrepresentatives from the state and by a sprinkling of ex-governors and\r\nex-members of congress. When completed it was a formidable document. Its\r\npreparation and that of more minute plots of the new city consumed the\r\nvaluable time of Sellers and Harry for many weeks, and served to keep\r\nthem both in the highest spirits.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of Washington Hawkins, Harry was a superior being, a man who\r\nwas able to bring things to pass in a way that excited his enthusiasm.\r\nHe never tired of listening to his stories of what he had done and of\r\nwhat he was going to do. As for Washington, Harry thought he was a man\r\nof ability and comprehension, but \xe2\x80\x9ctoo visionary,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the Colonel.\r\nThe Colonel said he might be right, but he had never noticed anything\r\nvisionary about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe's got his plans, sir. God bless my soul, at his age, I was full of\r\nplans. But experience sobers a man, I never touch any thing now that\r\nhasn't been weighed in my judgment; and when Beriah Sellers puts his\r\njudgment on a thing, there it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhatever might have been Harry's intentions with regard to Laura, he saw\r\nmore and more of her every day, until he got to be restless and nervous\r\nwhen he was not with her.\r\n\r\nThat consummate artist in passion allowed him to believe that the\r\nfascination was mainly on his side, and so worked upon his vanity,\r\nwhile inflaming his ardor, that he scarcely knew what he was about. Her\r\ncoolness and coyness were even made to appear the simple precautions\r\nof a modest timidity, and attracted him even more than the little\r\ntendernesses into which she was occasionally surprised. He could\r\nnever be away from her long, day or evening; and in a short time their\r\nintimacy was the town talk. She played with him so adroitly that Harry\r\nthought she was absorbed in love for him, and yet he was amazed that he\r\ndid not get on faster in his conquest.\r\n\r\nAnd when he thought of it, he was piqued as well. A country girl, poor\r\nenough, that was evident; living with her family in a cheap and most\r\nunattractive frame house, such as carpenters build in America, scantily\r\nfurnished and unadorned; without the adventitious aids of dress or\r\njewels or the fine manners of society--Harry couldn't understand it.\r\nBut she fascinated him, and held him just beyond the line of absolute\r\nfamiliarity at the same time. While he was with her she made him forget\r\nthat the Hawkins' house was nothing but a wooden tenement, with four\r\nsmall square rooms on the ground floor and a half story; it might have\r\nbeen a palace for aught he knew.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Laura was older than Harry. She was, at any rate, at that ripe\r\nage when beauty in woman seems more solid than in the budding period of\r\ngirlhood, and she had come to understand her powers perfectly, and to\r\nknow exactly how much of the susceptibility and archness of the girl\r\nit was profitable to retain. She saw that many women, with the best\r\nintentions, make a mistake of carrying too much girlishness into\r\nwomanhood. Such a woman would have attracted Harry at any time, but only\r\na woman with a cool brain and exquisite art could have made him lose\r\nhis head in this way; for Harry thought himself a man of the world. The\r\nyoung fellow never dreamed that he was merely being experimented on; he\r\nwas to her a man of another society and another culture, different from\r\nthat she had any knowledge of except in books, and she was not unwilling\r\nto try on him the fascinations of her mind and person.\r\n\r\nFor Laura had her dreams. She detested the narrow limits in which her\r\nlot was cast, she hated poverty. Much of her reading had been of modern\r\nworks of fiction, written by her own sex, which had revealed to her\r\nsomething of her own powers and given her indeed, an exaggerated notion\r\nof the influence, the wealth, the position a woman may attain who has\r\nbeauty and talent and ambition and a little culture, and is not too\r\nscrupulous in the use of them. She wanted to be rich, she wanted luxury,\r\nshe wanted men at her feet, her slaves, and she had not--thanks to some\r\nof the novels she had read--the nicest discrimination between notoriety\r\nand reputation; perhaps she did not know how fatal notoriety usually is\r\nto the bloom of womanhood.\r\n\r\nWith the other Hawkins children Laura had been brought up in the belief\r\nthat they had inherited a fortune in the Tennessee Lands. She did not\r\nby any means share all the delusion of the family; but her brain was\r\nnot seldom busy with schemes about it. Washington seemed to her only to\r\ndream of it and to be willing to wait for its riches to fall upon him\r\nin a golden shower; but she was impatient, and wished she were a man to\r\ntake hold of the business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou men must enjoy your schemes and your activity and liberty to go\r\nabout the world,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Harry one day, when he had been talking of\r\nNew York and Washington and his incessant engagements.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied that martyr to business, \xe2\x80\x9cit's all well enough, if\r\nyou don't have too much of it, but it only has one object.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf a woman doesn't know, it's useless to tell her. What do you suppose\r\nI am staying in Hawkeye for, week after week, when I ought to be with my\r\ncorps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it's your business with Col. Sellers about Napoleon, you've\r\nalways told me so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Laura, with a look intended to contradict\r\nher words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now I tell you that is all arranged, I suppose you'll tell me I\r\nought to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHarry!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Laura, touching his arm and letting her pretty hand\r\nrest there a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I want you to go away? The only person\r\nin Hawkeye who understands me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you refuse to understand me,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harry, flattered but still\r\npetulant. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are like an iceberg, when we are alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura looked up with wonder in her great eyes, and something like a\r\nblush suffusing her face, followed by a look of langour that penetrated\r\nHarry's heart as if it had been longing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I ever show any want of confidence in you, Harry?\xe2\x80\x9d And she gave\r\nhim her hand, which Harry pressed with effusion--something in her manner\r\ntold him that he must be content with that favor.\r\n\r\nIt was always so. She excited his hopes and denied him, inflamed his\r\npassion and restrained it, and wound him in her toils day by day. To\r\nwhat purpose? It was keen delight to Laura to prove that she had power\r\nover men.\r\n\r\nLaura liked to hear about life at the east, and especially about the\r\nluxurious society in which Mr. Brierly moved when he was at home. It\r\npleased her imagination to fancy herself a queen in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should be a winter in Washington,\xe2\x80\x9d Harry said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have no acquaintances there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't know any of the families of the congressmen? They like to have a\r\npretty woman staying with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose Col. Sellers should, have business there; say, about this\r\nColumbus River appropriation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSellers!\xe2\x80\x9d and Laura laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn't laugh. Queerer things have happened. Sellers knows\r\neverybody from Missouri, and from the West, too, for that matter. He'd\r\nintroduce you to Washington life quick enough. It doesn't need a crowbar\r\nto break your way into society there as it does in Philadelphia. It's\r\ndemocratic, Washington is. Money or beauty will open any door. If I were\r\na handsome woman, I shouldn't want any better place than the capital to\r\npick up a prince or a fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Laura. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I prefer the quiet of home, and the\r\nlove of those I know;\xe2\x80\x9d and her face wore a look of sweet contentment and\r\nunworldliness that finished Mr. Harry Brierly for the day.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the hint that Harry had dropped fell upon good ground, and\r\nbore fruit an hundred fold; it worked in her mind until she had built\r\nup a plan on it, and almost a career for herself. Why not, she said, why\r\nshouldn't I do as other women have done? She took the first opportunity\r\nto see Col. Sellers, and to sound him about the Washington visit. How\r\nwas he getting on with his navigation scheme, would it be likely to take\r\nhim from home to Jefferson City; or to Washington, perhaps?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, maybe. If the people of Napoleon want me to go to Washington,\r\nand look after that matter, I might tear myself from my home. It's been\r\nsuggested to me, but--not a word of it to Mrs. Sellers and the children.\r\nMaybe they wouldn't like to think of their father in Washington. But\r\nDilworthy, Senator Dilworthy, says to me, 'Colonel, you are the man, you\r\ncould influence more votes than any one else on such a measure, an old\r\nsettler, a man of the people, you know the wants of Missouri; you've a\r\nrespect for religion too, says he, and know how the cause of the gospel\r\ngoes with improvements: Which is true enough, Miss Laura, and hasn't\r\nbeen enough thought of in connection with Napoleon. He's an able man,\r\nDilworthy, and a good man. A man has got to be good to succeed as he\r\nhas. He's only been in Congress a few years, and he must be worth a\r\nmillion. First thing in the morning when he stayed with me he asked\r\nabout family prayers, whether we had 'em before or after breakfast. I\r\nhated to disappoint the Senator, but I had to out with it, tell him\r\nwe didn't have 'em, not steady. He said he understood, business\r\ninterruptions and all that, some men were well enough without, but as\r\nfor him he never neglected the ordinances of religion. He doubted if\r\nthe Columbus River appropriation would succeed if we did not invoke the\r\nDivine Blessing on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is unnecessary to say to the reader that Senator Dilworthy\r\nhad not stayed with Col. Sellers while he was in Hawkeye; this visit to\r\nhis house being only one of the Colonel's hallucinations--one of those\r\ninstant creations of his fertile fancy, which were always flashing into\r\nhis brain and out of his mouth in the course of any conversation and\r\nwithout interrupting the flow of it.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer Philip rode across the country and made a short visit\r\nin Hawkeye, giving Harry an opportunity to show him the progress that\r\nhe and the Colonel had made in their operation at Stone's Landing,\r\nto introduce him also to Laura, and to borrow a little money when he\r\ndeparted. Harry bragged about his conquest, as was his habit, and took\r\nPhilip round to see his western prize.\r\n\r\nLaura received Mr. Philip with a courtesy and a slight hauteur that\r\nrather surprised and not a little interested him. He saw at once that\r\nshe was older than Harry, and soon made up his mind that she was leading\r\nhis friend a country dance to which he was unaccustomed. At least he\r\nthought he saw that, and half hinted as much to Harry, who flared up at\r\nonce; but on a second visit Philip was not so sure, the young lady was\r\ncertainly kind and friendly and almost confiding with Harry, and treated\r\nPhilip with the greatest consideration. She deferred to his opinions,\r\nand listened attentively when he talked, and in time met his frank\r\nmanner with an equal frankness, so that he was quite convinced that\r\nwhatever she might feel towards Harry, she was sincere with him. Perhaps\r\nhis manly way did win her liking. Perhaps in her mind, she compared him\r\nwith Harry, and recognized in him a man to whom a woman might give her\r\nwhole soul, recklessly and with little care if she lost it. Philip\r\nwas not invincible to her beauty nor to the intellectual charm of her\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nThe week seemed very short that he passed in Hawkeye, and when he bade\r\nLaura good by, he seemed to have known her a year.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see you again, Mr. Sterling,\xe2\x80\x9d she said as she gave him her\r\nhand, with just a shade of sadness in her handsome eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd when he turned away she followed him with a look that might have\r\ndisturbed his serenity, if he had not at the moment had a little square\r\nletter in his breast pocket, dated at Philadelphia, and signed \xe2\x80\x9cRuth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nThe visit of Senator Abner Dilworthy was an event in Hawkeye. When a\r\nSenator, whose place is in Washington moving among the Great and guiding\r\nthe destinies of the nation, condescends to mingle among the people and\r\naccept the hospitalities of such a place as Hawkeye, the honor is not\r\nconsidered a light one. All parties are flattered by it and politics are\r\nforgotten in the presence of one so distinguished among his fellows.\r\n\r\nSenator Dilworthy, who was from a neighboring state, had been a Unionist\r\nin the darkest days of his country, and had thriven by it, but was that\r\nany reason why Col. Sellers, who had been a confederate and had not\r\nthriven by it, should give him the cold shoulder?\r\n\r\nThe Senator was the guest of his old friend Gen. Boswell, but it\r\nalmost appeared that he was indebted to Col. Sellers for the unreserved\r\nhospitalities of the town. It was the large hearted Colonel who, in a\r\nmanner, gave him the freedom of the city.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are known here, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel, \xe2\x80\x9cand Hawkeye is proud of\r\nyou. You will find every door open, and a welcome at every hearthstone.\r\nI should insist upon your going to my house, if you were not claimed by\r\nyour older friend Gen. Boswell. But you will mingle with our people, and\r\nyou will see here developments that will surprise you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel was so profuse in his hospitality that he must have made the\r\nimpression upon himself that he had entertained the Senator at his own\r\nmansion during his stay; at any rate, he afterwards always spoke of him\r\nas his guest, and not seldom referred to the Senator's relish of certain\r\nviands on his table. He did, in fact, press him to dine upon the morning\r\nof the day the Senator was going away.\r\n\r\nSenator Dilworthy was large and portly, though not tall--a pleasant\r\nspoken man, a popular man with the people.\r\n\r\nHe took a lively interest in the town and all the surrounding country,\r\nand made many inquiries as to the progress of agriculture, of education,\r\nand of religion, and especially as to the condition of the emancipated\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProvidence,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9chas placed them in our hands, and although you\r\nand I, General, might have chosen a different destiny for them, under\r\nthe Constitution, yet Providence knows best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can't do much with 'em,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Col. Sellers. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are a\r\nspeculating race, sir, disinclined to work for white folks without\r\nsecurity, planning how to live by only working for themselves. Idle,\r\nsir, there's my garden just a ruin of weeds. Nothing practical in 'em.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is some truth in your observation, Colonel, but you must educate\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou educate the niggro and you make him more speculating than he was\r\nbefore. If he won't stick to any industry except for himself now, what\r\nwill he do then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Colonel, the negro when educated will be more able to make his\r\nspeculations fruitful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, sir, never. He would only have a wider scope to injure himself.\r\nA niggro has no grasp, sir. Now, a white man can conceive great\r\noperations, and carry them out; a niggro can't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Senator, \xe2\x80\x9cgranting that he might injure himself in\r\na worldly point of view, his elevation through education would multiply\r\nhis chances for the hereafter--which is the important thing after all,\r\nColonel. And no matter what the result is, we must fulfill our duty by\r\nthis being.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd elevate his soul,\xe2\x80\x9d promptly responded the Colonel; \xe2\x80\x9cthat's just it;\r\nyou can't make his soul too immortal, but I wouldn't touch him, himself.\r\nYes, sir! make his soul immortal, but don't disturb the niggro as he\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course one of the entertainments offered the Senator was a public\r\nreception, held in the court house, at which he made a speech to his\r\nfellow citizens. Col. Sellers was master of ceremonies. He escorted the\r\nband from the city hotel to Gen. Boswell's; he marshalled the procession\r\nof Masons, of Odd Fellows, and of Firemen, the Good Templars, the Sons\r\nof Temperance, the Cadets of Temperance, the Daughters of Rebecca,\r\nthe Sunday School children, and citizens generally, which followed the\r\nSenator to the court house; he bustled about the room long after every\r\none else was seated, and loudly cried \xe2\x80\x9cOrder!\xe2\x80\x9d in the dead silence which\r\npreceded the introduction of the Senator by Gen. Boswell. The occasion\r\nwas one to call out his finest powers of personal appearance, and one he\r\nlong dwelt on with pleasure.\r\n\r\nThis not being an edition of the Congressional Globe it is impossible to\r\ngive Senator Dilworthy's speech in full. He began somewhat as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFellow citizens: It gives me great pleasure to thus meet and mingle\r\nwith you, to lay aside for a moment the heavy duties of an official and\r\nburdensome station, and confer in familiar converse with my friends in\r\nyour great state. The good opinion of my fellow citizens of all sections\r\nis the sweetest solace in all my anxieties. I look forward with longing\r\nto the time when I can lay aside the cares of office--\xe2\x80\x9d [\xe2\x80\x9cdam sight,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n shouted a tipsy fellow near the door. Cries of \xe2\x80\x9cput him out.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends, do not remove him. Let the misguided man stay. I see that\r\nhe is a victim of that evil which is swallowing up public virtue and\r\nsapping the foundation of society. As I was saying, when I can lay down\r\nthe cares of office and retire to the sweets of private life in some\r\nsuch sweet, peaceful, intelligent, wide-awake and patriotic place as\r\nHawkeye (applause). I have traveled much, I have seen all parts of our\r\nglorious union, but I have never seen a lovelier village than yours,\r\nor one that has more signs of commercial and industrial and religious\r\nprosperity--(more applause).\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Senator then launched into a sketch of our great country, and dwelt\r\nfor an hour or more upon its prosperity and the dangers which threatened\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe then touched reverently upon the institutions of religion, and upon\r\nthe necessity of private purity, if we were to have any public morality.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI trust,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there are children within the sound of my\r\nvoice,\xe2\x80\x9d and after some remarks to them, the Senator closed with an\r\napostrophe to \xe2\x80\x9cthe genius of American Liberty, walking with the Sunday\r\nSchool in one hand and Temperance in the other up the glorified steps of\r\nthe National Capitol.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCol. Sellers did not of course lose the opportunity to impress upon so\r\ninfluential a person as the Senator the desirability of improving the\r\nnavigation of Columbus river. He and Mr. Brierly took the Senator over\r\nto Napoleon and opened to him their plan. It was a plan that the Senator\r\ncould understand without a great deal of explanation, for he seemed to\r\nbe familiar with the like improvements elsewhere. When, however, they\r\nreached Stone's Landing the Senator looked about him and inquired,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this Napoleon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the nucleus, the nucleus,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel, unrolling his map.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the deepo, the church, the City Hall and so on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I see. How far from here is Columbus River? Does that stream\r\nempty----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, why, that's Goose Run. Thar ain't no Columbus, thout'n it's over\r\nto Hawkeye,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted one of the citizens, who had come out to stare\r\nat the strangers. \xe2\x80\x9cA railroad come here last summer, but it haint been\r\nhere no mo'.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d the Colonel hastened to explain, \xe2\x80\x9cin the old records\r\nColumbus River is called Goose Run. You see how it sweeps round the\r\ntown--forty-nine miles to the Missouri; sloop navigation all the way\r\npretty much drains this whole country; when it's improved steamboats\r\nwill run right up here. It's got to be enlarged, deepened. You see by\r\nthe map. Columbus River. This country must have water communication!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'll want a considerable appropriation, Col. Sellers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say a million; is that your figure Mr. Brierly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to our surveys,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry, \xe2\x80\x9ca million would do it; a\r\nmillion spent on the river would make Napoleon worth two millions at\r\nleast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see,\xe2\x80\x9d nodded the Senator. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you'd better begin by asking only for\r\ntwo or three hundred thousand, the usual way. You can begin to sell town\r\nlots on that appropriation you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Senator, himself, to do him justice, was not very much interested in\r\nthe country or the stream, but he favored the appropriation, and he gave\r\nthe Colonel and Mr. Brierly to understand that he would endeavor to get\r\nit through. Harry, who thought he was shrewd and understood Washington,\r\nsuggested an interest.\r\n\r\nBut he saw that the Senator was wounded by the suggestion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will offend me by repeating such an observation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever I do will be for the public interest. It will require a\r\nportion of the appropriation for necessary expenses, and I am sorry to\r\nsay that there are members who will have to be seen. But you can reckon\r\nupon my humble services.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis aspect of the subject was not again alluded to. The Senator\r\npossessed himself of the facts, not from his observation of the ground,\r\nbut from the lips of Col. Sellers, and laid the appropriation scheme\r\naway among his other plans for benefiting the public.\r\n\r\nIt was on this visit also that the Senator made the acquaintance of\r\nMr. Washington Hawkins, and was greatly taken with his innocence, his\r\nguileless manner and perhaps with his ready adaptability to enter upon\r\nany plan proposed.\r\n\r\nCol. Sellers was pleased to see this interest that Washington had\r\nawakened, especially since it was likely to further his expectations\r\nwith regard to the Tennessee lands; the Senator having remarked to the\r\nColonel, that he delighted to help any deserving young man, when the\r\npromotion of a private advantage could at the same time be made to\r\ncontribute to the general good. And he did not doubt that this was an\r\nopportunity of that kind.\r\n\r\nThe result of several conferences with Washington was that the Senator\r\nproposed that he should go to Washington with him and become his private\r\nsecretary and the secretary of his committee; a proposal which was\r\neagerly accepted.\r\n\r\nThe Senator spent Sunday in Hawkeye and attended church. He cheered\r\nthe heart of the worthy and zealous minister by an expression of his\r\nsympathy in his labors, and by many inquiries in regard to the religious\r\nstate of the region. It was not a very promising state, and the good man\r\nfelt how much lighter his task would be, if he had the aid of such a man\r\nas Senator Dilworthy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to see, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Senator, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you give them\r\nthe doctrines. It is owing to a neglect of the doctrines, that there is\r\nsuch a fearful falling away in the country. I wish that we might have\r\nyou in Washington--as chaplain, now, in the senate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe good man could not but be a little flattered, and if sometimes,\r\nthereafter, in his discouraging work, he allowed the thought that he\r\nmight perhaps be called to Washington as chaplain of the Senate, to\r\ncheer him, who can wonder. The Senator's commendation at least did one\r\nservice for him, it elevated him in the opinion of Hawkeye.\r\n\r\nLaura was at church alone that day, and Mr. Brierly walked home with\r\nher. A part of their way lay with that of General Boswell and Senator\r\nDilworthy, and introductions were made. Laura had her own reasons for\r\nwishing to know the Senator, and the Senator was not a man who could\r\nbe called indifferent to charms such as hers. That meek young lady\r\nso commended herself to him in the short walk, that he announced his\r\nintentions of paying his respects to her the next day, an intention\r\nwhich Harry received glumly; and when the Senator was out of hearing he\r\ncalled him \xe2\x80\x9can old fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Laura, \xe2\x80\x9cI do believe you are jealous, Harry. He is a very\r\npleasant man. He said you were a young man of great promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Senator did call next day, and the result of his visit was that he\r\nwas confirmed in his impression that there was something about him very\r\nattractive to ladies. He saw Laura again and again during his stay, and\r\nfelt more and more the subtle influence of her feminine beauty, which\r\nevery man felt who came near her.\r\n\r\nHarry was beside himself with rage while the Senator remained in town;\r\nhe declared that women were always ready to drop any man for higher\r\ngame; and he attributed his own ill-luck to the Senator's appearance.\r\nThe fellow was in fact crazy about her beauty and ready to beat his\r\nbrains out in chagrin. Perhaps Laura enjoyed his torment, but she\r\nsoothed him with blandishments that increased his ardor, and she smiled\r\nto herself to think that he had, with all his protestations of love,\r\nnever spoken of marriage. Probably the vivacious fellow never had\r\nthought of it. At any rate when he at length went away from Hawkeye he\r\nwas no nearer it. But there was no telling to what desperate lengths his\r\npassion might not carry him.\r\n\r\nLaura bade him good bye with tender regret, which, however, did not\r\ndisturb her peace or interfere with her plans. The visit of Senator\r\nDilworthy had become of more importance to her, and it by and by bore\r\nthe fruit she longed for, in an invitation to visit his family in the\r\nNational Capital during the winter session of Congress.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n     O lift your natures up:\r\n     Embrace our aims: work out your freedom. Girls,\r\n     Knowledge is now no more a fountain sealed;\r\n     Drink deep until the habits of the slave,\r\n     The sins of emptiness, gossip and spite\r\n     And slander, die.\r\n\r\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Princess.\r\n\r\nWhether medicine is a science, or only an empirical method of getting\r\na living out of the ignorance of the human race, Ruth found before her\r\nfirst term was over at the medical school that there were other things\r\nshe needed to know quite as much as that which is taught in medical\r\nbooks, and that she could never satisfy her aspirations without more\r\ngeneral culture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes your doctor know any thing--I don't mean about medicine, but about\r\nthings in general, is he a man of information and good sense?\xe2\x80\x9d once\r\nasked an old practitioner. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he doesn't know anything but medicine the\r\nchance is he doesn't know that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe close application to her special study was beginning to tell\r\nupon Ruth's delicate health also, and the summer brought with it only\r\nweariness and indisposition for any mental effort.\r\n\r\nIn this condition of mind and body the quiet of her home and the\r\nunexciting companionship of those about her were more than ever\r\ntiresome.\r\n\r\nShe followed with more interest Philip's sparkling account of his life\r\nin the west, and longed for his experiences, and to know some of those\r\npeople of a world so different from here, who alternately amused and\r\ndispleased him. He at least was learning the world, the good and the bad\r\nof it, as must happen to every one who accomplishes anything in it.\r\n\r\nBut what, Ruth wrote, could a woman do, tied up by custom, and cast\r\ninto particular circumstances out of which it was almost impossible\r\nto extricate herself? Philip thought that he would go some day and\r\nextricate Ruth, but he did not write that, for he had the instinct to\r\nknow that this was not the extrication she dreamed of, and that she must\r\nfind out by her own experience what her heart really wanted.\r\n\r\nPhilip was not a philosopher, to be sure, but he had the old fashioned\r\nnotion, that whatever a woman's theories of life might be, she would\r\ncome round to matrimony, only give her time. He could indeed recall to\r\nmind one woman--and he never knew a nobler--whose whole soul was devoted\r\nand who believed that her life was consecrated to a certain benevolent\r\nproject in singleness of life, who yielded to the touch of matrimony, as\r\nan icicle yields to a sunbeam.\r\n\r\nNeither at home nor elsewhere did Ruth utter any complaint, or admit any\r\nweariness or doubt of her ability to pursue the path she had marked\r\nout for herself. But her mother saw clearly enough her struggle with\r\ninfirmity, and was not deceived by either her gaiety or by the cheerful\r\ncomposure which she carried into all the ordinary duties that fell to\r\nher. She saw plainly enough that Ruth needed an entire change of scene\r\nand of occupation, and perhaps she believed that such a change, with the\r\nknowledge of the world it would bring, would divert Ruth from a course\r\nfor which she felt she was physically entirely unfitted.\r\n\r\nIt therefore suited the wishes of all concerned, when autumn came,\r\nthat Ruth should go away to school. She selected a large New England\r\nSeminary, of which she had often heard Philip speak, which was attended\r\nby both sexes and offered almost collegiate advantages of education.\r\nThither she went in September, and began for the second time in the year\r\na life new to her.\r\n\r\nThe Seminary was the chief feature of Fallkill, a village of two to\r\nthree thousand inhabitants. It was a prosperous school, with three\r\nhundred students, a large corps of teachers, men and women, and with a\r\nvenerable rusty row of academic buildings on the shaded square of the\r\ntown. The students lodged and boarded in private families in the place,\r\nand so it came about that while the school did a great deal to support\r\nthe town, the town gave the students society and the sweet influences of\r\nhome life. It is at least respectful to say that the influences of home\r\nlife are sweet.\r\n\r\nRuth's home, by the intervention of Philip, was in a family--one of the\r\nrare exceptions in life or in fiction--that had never known better days.\r\nThe Montagues, it is perhaps well to say, had intended to come over\r\nin the Mayflower, but were detained at Delft Haven by the illness of a\r\nchild. They came over to Massachusetts Bay in another vessel, and thus\r\nescaped the onus of that brevet nobility under which the successors of\r\nthe Mayflower Pilgrims have descended. Having no factitious weight of\r\ndignity to carry, the Montagues steadily improved their condition from\r\nthe day they landed, and they were never more vigorous or prosperous\r\nthan at the date of this narrative. With character compacted by the\r\nrigid Puritan discipline of more than two centuries, they had retained\r\nits strength and purity and thrown off its narrowness, and were now\r\nblossoming under the generous modern influences. Squire Oliver Montague,\r\na lawyer who had retired from the practice of his profession except\r\nin rare cases, dwelt in a square old fashioned New England mansion a\r\nquarter of a mile away from the green.\r\n\r\nIt was called a mansion because it stood alone with ample fields about\r\nit, and had an avenue of trees leading to it from the road, and on the\r\nwest commanded a view of a pretty little lake with gentle slopes and\r\nnodding were now blossoming under the generous modern influences. But\r\nit was just a plain, roomy house, capable of extending to many guests an\r\nunpretending hospitality.\r\n\r\nThe family consisted of the Squire and his wife, a son and a daughter\r\nmarried and not at home, a son in college at Cambridge, another son at\r\nthe Seminary, and a daughter Alice, who was a year or more older\r\nthan Ruth. Having only riches enough to be able to gratify reasonable\r\ndesires, and yet make their gratifications always a novelty and a\r\npleasure, the family occupied that just mean in life which is so rarely\r\nattained, and still more rarely enjoyed without discontent.\r\n\r\nIf Ruth did not find so much luxury in the house as in her own home,\r\nthere were evidences of culture, of intellectual activity and of a zest\r\nin the affairs of all the world, which greatly impressed her. Every room\r\nhad its book-cases or book-shelves, and was more or less a library; upon\r\nevery table was liable to be a litter of new books, fresh periodicals\r\nand daily newspapers.\r\n\r\nThere were plants in the sunny windows and some choice engravings on the\r\nwalls, with bits of color in oil or water-colors; the piano was sure\r\nto be open and strewn with music; and there were photographs and\r\nlittle souvenirs here and there of foreign travel. An absence of any\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat-pots\xe2\x80\x9d in the corners with rows of cheerful shells, and Hindoo\r\ngods, and Chinese idols, and nests of useless boxes of lacquered wood,\r\nmight be taken as denoting a languidness in the family concerning\r\nforeign missions, but perhaps unjustly.\r\n\r\nAt any rate the life of the world flowed freely into this hospitable\r\nhouse, and there was always so much talk there of the news of the day,\r\nof the new books and of authors, of Boston radicalism and New York\r\ncivilization, and the virtue of Congress, that small gossip stood a very\r\npoor chance.\r\n\r\nAll this was in many ways so new to Ruth that she seemed to have passed\r\ninto another world, in which she experienced a freedom and a mental\r\nexhilaration unknown to her before. Under this influence she entered\r\nupon her studies with keen enjoyment, finding for a time all the\r\nrelaxation she needed, in the charming social life at the Montague\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nIt is strange, she wrote to Philip, in one of her occasional letters,\r\nthat you never told me more about this delightful family, and scarcely\r\nmentioned Alice who is the life of it, just the noblest girl, unselfish,\r\nknows how to do so many things, with lots of talent, with a dry humor,\r\nand an odd way of looking at things, and yet quiet and even serious\r\noften--one of your \xe2\x80\x9ccapable\xe2\x80\x9d New England girls. We shall be great\r\nfriends. It had never occurred to Philip that there was any thing\r\nextraordinary about the family that needed mention. He knew dozens of\r\ngirls like Alice, he thought to himself, but only one like Ruth.\r\n\r\nGood friends the two girls were from the beginning. Ruth was a study to\r\nAlice; the product of a culture entirely foreign to her experience,\r\nso much a child in some things, so much a woman in others; and Ruth in\r\nturn, it must be confessed, probing Alice sometimes with her serious\r\ngrey eyes, wondered what her object in life was, and whether she had\r\nany purpose beyond living as she now saw her. For she could scarcely\r\nconceive of a life that should not be devoted to the accomplishment of\r\nsome definite work, and she had no doubt that in her own case everything\r\nelse would yield to the professional career she had marked out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you know Philip Sterling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ruth one day as the girls sat at\r\ntheir sewing. Ruth never embroidered, and never sewed when she could\r\navoid it. Bless her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, we are old friends. Philip used to come to Fallkill often while\r\nhe was in college. He was once rusticated here for a term.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRusticated?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuspended for some College scrape. He was a great favorite here.\r\nFather and he were famous friends. Father said that Philip had no end of\r\nnonsense in him and was always blundering into something, but he was a\r\nroyal good fellow and would come out all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you think he was fickle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I never thought whether he was or not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Alice looking up.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose he was always in love with some girl or another, as college\r\nboys are. He used to make me his confidant now and then, and be terribly\r\nin the dumps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did he come to you?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Ruth, \xe2\x80\x9cyou were younger than he.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm sure I don't know. He was at our house a good deal. Once at a\r\npicnic by the lake, at the risk of his own life, he saved sister Millie\r\nfrom drowning, and we all liked to have him here. Perhaps he thought\r\nas he had saved one sister, the other ought to help him when he was in\r\ntrouble. I don't know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fact was that Alice was a person who invited confidences, because\r\nshe never betrayed them, and gave abundant sympathy in return. There\r\nare persons, whom we all know, to whom human confidences, troubles and\r\nheart-aches flow as naturally as streams to a placid lake.\r\n\r\nThis is not a history of Fallkill, nor of the Montague family, worthy as\r\nboth are of that honor, and this narrative cannot be diverted into long\r\nloitering with them. If the reader visits the village to-day, he will\r\ndoubtless be pointed out the Montague dwelling, where Ruth lived, the\r\ncross-lots path she traversed to the Seminary, and the venerable chapel\r\nwith its cracked bell.\r\n\r\nIn the little society of the place, the Quaker girl was a favorite, and\r\nno considerable social gathering or pleasure party was thought complete\r\nwithout her. There was something in this seemingly transparent and yet\r\ndeep character, in her childlike gaiety and enjoyment of the society\r\nabout her, and in her not seldom absorption in herself, that would have\r\nmade her long remembered there if no events had subsequently occurred to\r\nrecall her to mind.\r\n\r\nTo the surprise of Alice, Ruth took to the small gaieties of the village\r\nwith a zest of enjoyment that seemed foreign to one who had devoted\r\nher life to a serious profession from the highest motives. Alice liked\r\nsociety well enough, she thought, but there was nothing exciting in that\r\nof Fallkill, nor anything novel in the attentions of the well-bred young\r\ngentlemen one met in it. It must have worn a different aspect to Ruth,\r\nfor she entered into its pleasures at first with curiosity, and then\r\nwith interest and finally with a kind of staid abandon that no one\r\nwould have deemed possible for her. Parties, picnics, rowing-matches,\r\nmoonlight strolls, nutting expeditions in the October woods,--Alice\r\ndeclared that it was a whirl of dissipation. The fondness of Ruth, which\r\nwas scarcely disguised, for the company of agreeable young fellows, who\r\ntalked nothings, gave Alice opportunity for no end of banter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you look upon them as I subjects, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d she would ask.\r\n\r\nAnd Ruth laughed her merriest laugh, and then looked sober again.\r\nPerhaps she was thinking, after all, whether she knew herself.\r\n\r\nIf you should rear a duck in the heart of the Sahara, no doubt it would\r\nswim if you brought it to the Nile.\r\n\r\nSurely no one would have predicted when Ruth left Philadelphia that she\r\nwould become absorbed to this extent, and so happy, in a life so unlike\r\nthat she thought she desired. But no one can tell how a woman will act\r\nunder any circumstances. The reason novelists nearly always fail in\r\ndepicting women when they make them act, is that they let them do what\r\nthey have observed some woman has done at sometime or another. And that\r\nis where they make a mistake; for a woman will never do again what has\r\nbeen done before. It is this uncertainty that causes women, considered\r\nas materials for fiction, to be so interesting to themselves and to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nAs the fall went on and the winter, Ruth did not distinguish herself\r\ngreatly at the Fallkill Seminary as a student, a fact that apparently\r\ngave her no anxiety, and did not diminish her enjoyment of a new sort of\r\npower which had awakened within her.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nIn mid-winter, an event occurred of unusual interest to the inhabitants\r\nof the Montague house, and to the friends of the young ladies who sought\r\ntheir society.\r\n\r\nThis was the arrival at the Sassacua Hotel of two young gentlemen from\r\nthe west.\r\n\r\nIt is the fashion in New England to give Indian names to the public\r\nhouses, not that the late lamented savage knew how to keep a hotel, but\r\nthat his warlike name may impress the traveler who humbly craves shelter\r\nthere, and make him grateful to the noble and gentlemanly clerk if he is\r\nallowed to depart with his scalp safe.\r\n\r\nThe two young gentlemen were neither students for the Fallkill Seminary,\r\nnor lecturers on physiology, nor yet life assurance solicitors, three\r\nsuppositions that almost exhausted the guessing power of the people at\r\nthe hotel in respect to the names of \xe2\x80\x9cPhilip Sterling and Henry Brierly,\r\nMissouri,\xe2\x80\x9d on the register. They were handsome enough fellows, that was\r\nevident, browned by out-door exposure, and with a free and lordly way\r\nabout them that almost awed the hotel clerk himself. Indeed, he very\r\nsoon set down Mr. Brierly as a gentleman of large fortune, with enormous\r\ninterests on his shoulders. Harry had a way of casually mentioning\r\nwestern investments, through lines, the freighting business, and the\r\nroute through the Indian territory to Lower California, which was\r\ncalculated to give an importance to his lightest word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou've a pleasant town here, sir, and the most comfortable looking\r\nhotel I've seen out of New York,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry to the clerk; \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall\r\nstay here a few days if you can give us a roomy suite of apartments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry usually had the best of everything, wherever he went, as such\r\nfellows always do have in this accommodating world. Philip would have\r\nbeen quite content with less expensive quarters, but there was no\r\nresisting Harry's generosity in such matters.\r\n\r\nRailroad surveying and real-estate operations were at a standstill\r\nduring the winter in Missouri, and the young men had taken advantage of\r\nthe lull to come east, Philip to see if there was any disposition in his\r\nfriends, the railway contractors, to give him a share in the Salt\r\nLick Union Pacific Extension, and Harry to open out to his uncle\r\nthe prospects of the new city at Stone's Landing, and to procure\r\ncongressional appropriations for the harbor and for making Goose Run\r\nnavigable. Harry had with him a map of that noble stream and of the\r\nharbor, with a perfect net-work of railroads centering in it, pictures\r\nof wharves, crowded with steamboats, and of huge grain-elevators on the\r\nbank, all of which grew out of the combined imaginations of Col. Sellers\r\nand Mr. Brierly. The Colonel had entire confidence in Harry's influence\r\nwith Wall street, and with congressmen, to bring about the consummation\r\nof their scheme, and he waited his return in the empty house at Hawkeye,\r\nfeeding his pinched family upon the most gorgeous expectations with a\r\nreckless prodigality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't let 'em into the thing more than is necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Colonel\r\nto Harry; \xe2\x80\x9cgive 'em a small interest; a lot apiece in the suburbs of the\r\nLanding ought to do a congressman, but I reckon you'll have to mortgage\r\na part of the city itself to the brokers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry did not find that eagerness to lend money on Stone's Landing in\r\nWall street which Col. Sellers had expected, (it had seen too many such\r\nmaps as he exhibited), although his uncle and some of the brokers looked\r\nwith more favor on the appropriation for improving the navigation of\r\nColumbus River, and were not disinclined to form a company for that\r\npurpose. An appropriation was a tangible thing, if you could get hold of\r\nit, and it made little difference what it was appropriated for, so long\r\nas you got hold of it.\r\n\r\nPending these weighty negotiations, Philip has persuaded Harry to take\r\na little run up to Fallkill, a not difficult task, for that young man\r\nwould at any time have turned his back upon all the land in the West\r\nat sight of a new and pretty face, and he had, it must be confessed, a\r\nfacility in love making which made it not at all an interference with\r\nthe more serious business of life. He could not, to be sure, conceive\r\nhow Philip could be interested in a young lady who was studying\r\nmedicine, but he had no objection to going, for he did not doubt that\r\nthere were other girls in Fallkill who were worth a week's attention.\r\n\r\nThe young men were received at the house of the Montagues with the\r\nhospitality which never failed there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are glad to see you again,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Squire heartily, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are\r\nwelcome Mr. Brierly, any friend of Phil's is welcome at our house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's more like home to me, than any place except my own home,\xe2\x80\x9d cried\r\nPhilip, as he looked about the cheerful house and went through a general\r\nhand-shaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's a long time, though, since you have been here to say so,\xe2\x80\x9d Alice\r\nsaid, with her father's frankness of manner; \xe2\x80\x9cand I suspect we owe the\r\nvisit now to your sudden interest in the Fallkill Seminary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip's color came, as it had an awkward way of doing in his tell-tale\r\nface, but before he could stammer a reply, Harry came in with,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat accounts for Phil's wish to build a Seminary at Stone's Landing,\r\nour place in Missouri, when Col. Sellers insisted it should be a\r\nUniversity. Phil appears to have a weakness for Seminaries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been better for your friend Sellers,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Philip,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif he had had a weakness for district schools. Col. Sellers, Miss\r\nAlice, is a great friend of Harry's, who is always trying to build a\r\nhouse by beginning at the top.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it's as easy to build a University on paper as a Seminary,\r\nand it looks better,\xe2\x80\x9d was Harry's reflection; at which the Squire\r\nlaughed, and said he quite agreed with him. The old gentleman understood\r\nStone's Landing a good deal better than he would have done after an\r\nhour's talk with either of it's expectant proprietors.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, and while Philip was trying to frame a question that\r\nhe found it exceedingly difficult to put into words, the door opened\r\nquietly, and Ruth entered. Taking in the group with a quick glance, her\r\neye lighted up, and with a merry smile she advanced and shook hands with\r\nPhilip. She was so unconstrained and sincerely cordial, that it made\r\nthat hero of the west feel somehow young, and very ill at ease.\r\n\r\nFor months and months he had thought of this meeting and pictured it\r\nto himself a hundred times, but he had never imagined it would be like\r\nthis. He should meet Ruth unexpectedly, as she was walking alone from\r\nthe school, perhaps, or entering the room where he was waiting for her,\r\nand she would cry \xe2\x80\x9cOh! Phil,\xe2\x80\x9d and then check herself, and perhaps blush,\r\nand Philip calm but eager and enthusiastic, would reassure her by his\r\nwarm manner, and he would take her hand impressively, and she would look\r\nup timidly, and, after his long absence, perhaps he would be permitted\r\nto-- Good heavens, how many times he had come to this point, and\r\nwondered if it could happen so. Well, well; he had never supposed that\r\nhe should be the one embarrassed, and above all by a sincere and cordial\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe heard you were at the Sassacus House,\xe2\x80\x9d were Ruth's first words; \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nthis I suppose is your friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d Philip at length blundered out, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is Mr.\r\nBrierly of whom I have written you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Ruth welcomed Harry with a friendliness that Philip thought was due\r\nto his friend, to be sure, but which seemed to him too level with her\r\nreception of himself, but which Harry received as his due from the other\r\nsex.\r\n\r\nQuestions were asked about the journey and about the West, and the\r\nconversation became a general one, until Philip at length found himself\r\ntalking with the Squire in relation to land and railroads and things he\r\ncouldn't keep his mind on especially as he heard Ruth and Harry in an\r\nanimated discourse, and caught the words \xe2\x80\x9cNew York,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9copera,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9creception,\xe2\x80\x9d and knew that Harry was giving his imagination full range\r\nin the world of fashion.\r\n\r\nHarry knew all about the opera, green room and all (at least he said\r\nso) and knew a good many of the operas and could make very entertaining\r\nstories of their plots, telling how the soprano came in here, and\r\nthe basso here, humming the beginning of their\r\nairs--tum-ti-tum-ti-ti--suggesting the profound dissatisfaction of the\r\nbasso recitative--down-among-the-dead-men--and touching off the whole\r\nwith an airy grace quite captivating; though he couldn't have sung a\r\nsingle air through to save himself, and he hadn't an ear to know whether\r\nit was sung correctly. All the same he doted on the opera, and kept a\r\nbox there, into which he lounged occasionally to hear a favorite scene\r\nand meet his society friends.\r\n\r\nIf Ruth was ever in the city he should be happy to place his box at the\r\ndisposal of Ruth and her friends. Needless to say that she was delighted\r\nwith the offer.\r\n\r\nWhen she told Philip of it, that discreet young fellow only smiled, and\r\nsaid that he hoped she would be fortunate enough to be in New York some\r\nevening when Harry had not already given the use of his private box to\r\nsome other friend.\r\n\r\nThe Squire pressed the visitors to let him send for their trunks and\r\nurged them to stay at his house, and Alice joined in the invitation, but\r\nPhilip had reasons for declining. They staid to supper however, and in\r\nthe evening Philip had a long talk apart with Ruth, a delightful hour to\r\nhim, in which she spoke freely of herself as of old, of her studies at\r\nPhiladelphia and of her plans, and she entered into his adventures and\r\nprospects in the West with a genuine and almost sisterly interest; an\r\ninterest, however, which did not exactly satisfy Philip--it was too\r\ngeneral and not personal enough to suit him. And with all her freedom\r\nin speaking of her own hopes, Philip could not, detect any reference\r\nto himself in them; whereas he never undertook anything that he did not\r\nthink of Ruth in connection with it, he never made a plan that had not\r\nreference to her, and he never thought of anything as complete if she\r\ncould not share it. Fortune, reputation these had no value to him except\r\nin Ruth's eyes, and there were times when it seemed to him that if Ruth\r\nwas not on this earth, he should plunge off into some remote wilderness\r\nand live in a purposeless seclusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hoped,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip; \xe2\x80\x9cto get a little start in connection with this\r\nnew railroad, and make a little money, so that I could come east and\r\nengage in something more suited to my tastes. I shouldn't like to live\r\nin the West. Would you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt never occurred to me whether I would or not,\xe2\x80\x9d was the unembarrassed\r\nreply. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of our graduates went to Chicago, and has a nice practice\r\nthere. I don't know where I shall go. It would mortify mother dreadfully\r\nto have me driving about Philadelphia in a doctor's gig.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip laughed at the idea of it. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd does it seem as necessary to you\r\nto do it as it did before you came to Fallkill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a home question, and went deeper than Philip knew, for Ruth at\r\nonce thought of practicing her profession among the young gentlemen\r\nand ladies of her acquaintance in the village; but she was reluctant to\r\nadmit to herself that her notions of a career had undergone any change.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don't think I should come to Fallkill to practice, but I must do\r\nsomething when I am through school; and why not medicine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip would like to have explained why not, but the explanation would\r\nbe of no use if it were not already obvious to Ruth.\r\n\r\nHarry was equally in his element whether instructing Squire Montague\r\nabout the investment of capital in Missouri, the improvement of Columbus\r\nRiver, the project he and some gentlemen in New York had for making a\r\nshorter Pacific connection with the Mississippi than the present one;\r\nor diverting Mrs. Montague with his experience in cooking in camp; or\r\ndrawing for Miss Alice an amusing picture of the social contrasts of New\r\nEngland and the border where he had been. Harry was a very entertaining\r\nfellow, having his imagination to help his memory, and telling his\r\nstories as if he believed them--as perhaps he did. Alice was greatly\r\namused with Harry and listened so seriously to his romancing that\r\nhe exceeded his usual limits. Chance allusions to his bachelor\r\nestablishment in town and the place of his family on the Hudson, could\r\nnot have been made by a millionaire, more naturally.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think,\xe2\x80\x9d queried Alice, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would rather stay in New York than\r\nto try the rough life at the West you have been speaking of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, adventure,\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry, \xe2\x80\x9cI get tired of New York. And besides I got\r\ninvolved in some operations that I had to see through. Parties in New\r\nYork only last week wanted me to go down into Arizona in a big diamond\r\ninterest. I told them, no, no speculation for me. I've got my interests\r\nin Missouri; and I wouldn't leave Philip, as long as he stays there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the young gentlemen were on their way back to the hotel, Mr.\r\nPhilip, who was not in very good humor, broke out,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the deuce, Harry, did you go on in that style to the Montagues\r\nfor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo on?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harry. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn't I try to make a pleasant evening?\r\nAnd besides, ain't I going to do those things? What difference does it\r\nmake about the mood and tense of a mere verb? Didn't uncle tell me only\r\nlast Saturday, that I might as well go down to Arizona and hunt for\r\ndiamonds? A fellow might as well make a good impression as a poor one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense. You'll get to believing your own romancing by and by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you'll see. When Sellers and I get that appropriation, I'll show\r\nyou an establishment in town and another on the Hudson and a box at the\r\nopera.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it will be like Col. Sellers' plantation at Hawkeye. Did you ever\r\nsee that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don't be cross, Phil. She's just superb, that little woman. You\r\nnever told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho's just superb?\xe2\x80\x9d growled Philip, fancying this turn of the\r\nconversation less than the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mrs. Montague, if you must know.\xe2\x80\x9d And Harry stopped to light a\r\ncigar, and then puffed on in silence. The little quarrel didn't last\r\nover night, for Harry never appeared to cherish any ill-will half a\r\nsecond, and Philip was too sensible to continue a row about nothing; and\r\nhe had invited Harry to come with him.\r\n\r\nThe young gentlemen stayed in Fallkill a week, and were every day at the\r\nMontagues, and took part in the winter gaieties of the village. There\r\nwere parties here and there to which the friends of Ruth and the\r\nMontagues were of course invited, and Harry in the generosity of his\r\nnature, gave in return a little supper at the hotel, very simple indeed,\r\nwith dancing in the hall, and some refreshments passed round. And Philip\r\nfound the whole thing in the bill when he came to pay it.\r\n\r\nBefore the week was over Philip thought he had a new light on the\r\ncharacter of Ruth. Her absorption in the small gaieties of the society\r\nthere surprised him. He had few opportunities for serious conversation\r\nwith her. There was always some butterfly or another flitting about, and\r\nwhen Philip showed by his manner that he was not pleased, Ruth laughed\r\nmerrily enough and rallied him on his soberness--she declared he was\r\ngetting to be grim and unsocial. He talked indeed more with Alice than\r\nwith Ruth, and scarcely concealed from her the trouble that was in his\r\nmind. It needed, in fact, no word from him, for she saw clearly enough\r\nwhat was going forward, and knew her sex well enough to know there was\r\nno remedy for it but time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuth is a dear girl, Philip, and has as much firmness of purpose as\r\never, but don't you see she has just discovered that she is fond of\r\nsociety? Don't you let her see you are selfish about it, is my advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last evening they were to spend in Fallkill, they were at the\r\nMontagues, and Philip hoped that he would find Ruth in a different mood.\r\nBut she was never more gay, and there was a spice of mischief in her\r\neye and in her laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cConfound it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cshe's in a\r\nperfect twitter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe would have liked to quarrel with her, and fling himself out of the\r\nhouse in tragedy style, going perhaps so far as to blindly wander off\r\nmiles into the country and bathe his throbbing brow in the chilling rain\r\nof the stars, as people do in novels; but he had no opportunity. For\r\nRuth was as serenely unconscious of mischief as women can be at times,\r\nand fascinated him more than ever with her little demurenesses and\r\nhalf-confidences. She even said \xe2\x80\x9cThee\xe2\x80\x9d to him once in reproach for a\r\ncutting speech he began. And the sweet little word made his heart beat\r\nlike a trip-hammer, for never in all her life had she said \xe2\x80\x9cthee\xe2\x80\x9d to him\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nWas she fascinated with Harry's careless 'bon homie' and gay assurance?\r\nBoth chatted away in high spirits, and made the evening whirl along in\r\nthe most mirthful manner. Ruth sang for Harry, and that young gentleman\r\nturned the leaves for her at the piano, and put in a bass note now and\r\nthen where he thought it would tell.\r\n\r\nYes, it was a merry evening, and Philip was heartily glad when it was\r\nover, and the long leave-taking with the family was through with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell Philip. Good night Mr. Brierly,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth's clear voice sounded\r\nafter them as they went down the walk.\r\n\r\nAnd she spoke Harry's name last, thought Philip.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cO see ye not yon narrow road\r\n     So thick beset wi' thorns and briers?\r\n     That is the Path of Righteousness,\r\n     Though after it but few inquires.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAnd see ye not yon braid, braid road,\r\n     That lies across the lily leven?\r\n     That is the Path of Wickedness,\r\n     Though some call it the road to Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     Thomas the Rhymer.\r\n\r\nPhillip and Harry reached New York in very different states of mind.\r\nHarry was buoyant. He found a letter from Col. Sellers urging him to go\r\nto Washington and confer with Senator Dilworthy. The petition was in his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nIt had been signed by everybody of any importance in Missouri, and would\r\nbe presented immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should go on myself,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote the Colonel, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I am engaged in the\r\ninvention of a process for lighting such a city as St. Louis by means\r\nof water; just attach my machine to the water-pipes anywhere and the\r\ndecomposition of the fluid begins, and you will have floods of light for\r\nthe mere cost of the machine. I've nearly got the lighting part, but I\r\nwant to attach to it a heating, cooking, washing and ironing\r\napparatus. It's going to be the great thing, but we'd better keep this\r\nappropriation going while I am perfecting it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry took letters to several congressmen from his uncle and from Mr.\r\nDuff Brown, each of whom had an extensive acquaintance in both houses\r\nwhere they were well known as men engaged in large private operations\r\nfor the public good and men, besides, who, in the slang of the day,\r\nunderstood the virtues of \xe2\x80\x9caddition, division and silence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSenator Dilworthy introduced the petition into the Senate with the\r\nremark that he knew, personally, the signers of it, that they were\r\nmen interested, it was true, in the improvement of the country, but\r\nhe believed without any selfish motive, and that so far as he knew the\r\nsigners were loyal. It pleased him to see upon the roll the names of\r\nmany colored citizens, and it must rejoice every friend of humanity to\r\nknow that this lately emancipated race were intelligently taking part\r\nin the development of the resources of their native land. He moved the\r\nreference of the petition to the proper committee.\r\n\r\nSenator Dilworthy introduced his young friend to influential members, as\r\na person who was very well informed about the Salt Lick Extension of the\r\nPacific, and was one of the Engineers who had made a careful survey of\r\nColumbus River; and left him to exhibit his maps and plans and to show\r\nthe connection between the public treasury, the city of Napoleon and\r\nlegislation for the benefit off the whole country.\r\n\r\nHarry was the guest of Senator Dilworthy. There was scarcely any good\r\nmovement in which the Senator was not interested. His house was open to\r\nall the laborers in the field of total abstinence, and much of his time\r\nwas taken up in attending the meetings of this cause. He had a Bible\r\nclass in the Sunday school of the church which he attended, and he\r\nsuggested to Harry that he might take a class during the time he\r\nremained in Washington. Mr. Washington Hawkins had a class. Harry asked\r\nthe Senator if there was a class of young ladies for him to teach, and\r\nafter that the Senator did not press the subject.\r\n\r\nPhilip, if the truth must be told, was not well satisfied with his\r\nwestern prospects, nor altogether with the people he had fallen in with.\r\nThe railroad contractors held out large but rather indefinite promises.\r\nOpportunities for a fortune he did not doubt existed in Missouri, but\r\nfor himself he saw no better means for livelihood than the mastery of\r\nthe profession he had rather thoughtlessly entered upon. During the\r\nsummer he had made considerable practical advance in the science of\r\nengineering; he had been diligent, and made himself to a certain extent\r\nnecessary to the work he was engaged on. The contractors called him into\r\ntheir consultations frequently, as to the character of the country he\r\nhad been over, and the cost of constructing the road, the nature of the\r\nwork, etc.\r\n\r\nStill Philip felt that if he was going to make either reputation or\r\nmoney as an engineer, he had a great deal of hard study before him, and\r\nit is to his credit that he did not shrink from it. While Harry was in\r\nWashington dancing attendance upon the national legislature and making\r\nthe acquaintance of the vast lobby that encircled it, Philip devoted\r\nhimself day and night, with an energy and a concentration he was capable\r\nof, to the learning and theory of his profession, and to the science of\r\nrailroad building. He wrote some papers at this time for the \xe2\x80\x9cPlow, the\r\nLoom and the Anvil,\xe2\x80\x9d upon the strength of materials, and especially upon\r\nbridge-building, which attracted considerable attention, and were copied\r\ninto the English \xe2\x80\x9cPractical Magazine.\xe2\x80\x9d They served at any rate to raise\r\nPhilip in the opinion of his friends the contractors, for practical men\r\nhave a certain superstitious estimation of ability with the pen, and\r\nthough they may a little despise the talent, they are quite ready to\r\nmake use of it.\r\n\r\nPhilip sent copies of his performances to Ruth's father and to other\r\ngentlemen whose good opinion he coveted, but he did not rest upon his\r\nlaurels. Indeed, so diligently had he applied himself, that when it came\r\ntime for him to return to the West, he felt himself, at least in theory,\r\ncompetent to take charge of a division in the field.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nThe capital of the Great Republic was a new world to country-bred\r\nWashington Hawkins. St. Louis was a greater city, but its floating\r\npopulation did not hail from great distances, and so it had the general\r\nfamily aspect of the permanent population; but Washington gathered its\r\npeople from the four winds of heaven, and so the manners, the faces and\r\nthe fashions there, presented a variety that was infinite. Washington\r\nhad never been in \xe2\x80\x9csociety\xe2\x80\x9d in St. Louis, and he knew nothing of the\r\nways of its wealthier citizens and had never inspected one of their\r\ndwellings. Consequently, everything in the nature of modern fashion and\r\ngrandeur was a new and wonderful revelation to him.\r\n\r\nWashington is an interesting city to any of us. It seems to become more\r\nand more interesting the oftener we visit it. Perhaps the reader has\r\nnever been there? Very well. You arrive either at night, rather too late\r\nto do anything or see anything until morning, or you arrive so early in\r\nthe morning that you consider it best to go to your hotel and sleep an\r\nhour or two while the sun bothers along over the Atlantic. You cannot\r\nwell arrive at a pleasant intermediate hour, because the railway\r\ncorporation that keeps the keys of the only door that leads into the\r\ntown or out of it take care of that. You arrive in tolerably good\r\nspirits, because it is only thirty-eight miles from Baltimore to the\r\ncapital, and so you have only been insulted three times (provided you\r\nare not in a sleeping car--the average is higher there): once when you\r\nrenewed your ticket after stopping over in Baltimore; once when you were\r\nabout to enter the \xe2\x80\x9cladies' car\xe2\x80\x9d without knowing it was a lady's car;\r\nand once when you asked the conductor at what hour you would reach\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nYou are assailed by a long rank of hackmen who shake their whips in your\r\nface as you step out upon the sidewalk; you enter what they regard as a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccarriage,\xe2\x80\x9d in the capital, and you wonder why they do not take it out\r\nof service and put it in the museum: we have few enough antiquities, and\r\nit is little to our credit that we make scarcely any effort to preserve\r\nthe few we have.\r\n\r\nYou reach your hotel, presently--and here let us draw the curtain of\r\ncharity--because of course you have gone to the wrong one. You being a\r\nstranger, how could you do otherwise? There are a hundred and eighteen\r\nbad hotels, and only one good one. The most renowned and popular hotel\r\nof them all is perhaps the worst one known to history.\r\n\r\nIt is winter, and night. When you arrived, it was snowing. When you\r\nreached the hotel, it was sleeting. When you went to bed, it was\r\nraining. During the night it froze hard, and the wind blew some chimneys\r\ndown. When you got up in the morning, it was foggy. When you finished\r\nyour breakfast at ten o'clock and went out, the sunshine was brilliant,\r\nthe weather balmy and delicious, and the mud and slush deep and\r\nall-pervading. You will like the climate when you get used to it.\r\n\r\nYou naturally wish to view the city; so you take an umbrella, an\r\novercoat, and a fan, and go forth. The prominent features you soon\r\nlocate and get familiar with; first you glimpse the ornamental upper\r\nworks of a long, snowy palace projecting above a grove of trees, and a\r\ntall, graceful white dome with a statue on it surmounting the palace and\r\npleasantly contrasting with the background of blue sky. That building is\r\nthe capitol; gossips will tell you that by the original estimates it was\r\nto cost $12,000,000, and that the government did come within $21,200,000\r\nof building it for that sum.\r\n\r\nYou stand at the back of the capitol to treat yourself to a view, and it\r\nis a very noble one. You understand, the capitol stands upon the verge\r\nof a high piece of table land, a fine commanding position, and its front\r\nlooks out over this noble situation for a city--but it don't see it,\r\nfor the reason that when the capitol extension was decided upon, the\r\nproperty owners at once advanced their prices to such inhuman figures\r\nthat the people went down and built the city in the muddy low marsh\r\nbehind the temple of liberty; so now the lordly front of the building,\r\nwith, its imposing colonades, its projecting graceful wings, its\r\npicturesque groups of statuary, and its long terraced ranges of steps,\r\nflowing down in white marble waves to the ground, merely looks out upon\r\na sorrowful little desert of cheap boarding houses.\r\n\r\nSo you observe, that you take your view from the back of the capitol.\r\nAnd yet not from the airy outlooks of the dome, by the way, because to\r\nget there you must pass through the great rotunda: and to do that, you\r\nwould have to see the marvelous Historical Paintings that hang there,\r\nand the bas-reliefs--and what have you done that you should suffer\r\nthus? And besides, you might have to pass through the old part of the\r\nbuilding, and you could not help seeing Mr. Lincoln, as petrified by\r\na young lady artist for $10,000--and you might take his marble\r\nemancipation proclamation, which he holds out in his hand and\r\ncontemplates, for a folded napkin; and you might conceive from his\r\nexpression and his attitude, that he is finding fault with the washing.\r\nWhich is not the case. Nobody knows what is the matter with him; but\r\neverybody feels for him. Well, you ought not to go into the dome anyhow,\r\nbecause it would be utterly impossible to go up there without seeing the\r\nfrescoes in it--and why should you be interested in the delirium tremens\r\nof art?\r\n\r\nThe capitol is a very noble and a very beautiful building, both within\r\nand without, but you need not examine it now. Still, if you greatly\r\nprefer going into the dome, go. Now your general glance gives you\r\npicturesque stretches of gleaming water, on your left, with a sail here\r\nand there and a lunatic asylum on shore; over beyond the water, on a\r\ndistant elevation, you see a squat yellow temple which your eye dwells\r\nupon lovingly through a blur of unmanly moisture, for it recalls your\r\nlost boyhood and the Parthenons done in molasses candy which made it\r\nblest and beautiful. Still in the distance, but on this side of the\r\nwater and close to its edge, the Monument to the Father of his Country\r\ntowers out of the mud--sacred soil is the customary term. It has the\r\naspect of a factory chimney with the top broken off. The skeleton of a\r\ndecaying scaffolding lingers about its summit, and tradition says that\r\nthe spirit of Washington often comes down and sits on those rafters to\r\nenjoy this tribute of respect which the nation has reared as the symbol\r\nof its unappeasable gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe Monument is to be finished, some day, and at that time our\r\nWashington will have risen still higher in the nation's veneration,\r\nand will be known as the Great-Great-Grandfather of his Country. The\r\nmemorial Chimney stands in a quiet pastoral locality that is full of\r\nreposeful expression. With a glass you can see the cow-sheds about its\r\nbase, and the contented sheep nimbling pebbles in the desert solitudes\r\nthat surround it, and the tired pigs dozing in the holy calm of its\r\nprotecting shadow.\r\n\r\nNow you wrench your gaze loose, and you look down in front of you and\r\nsee the broad Pennsylvania Avenue stretching straight ahead for a mile\r\nor more till it brings up against the iron fence in front of a pillared\r\ngranite pile, the Treasury building-an edifice that would command\r\nrespect in any capital. The stores and hotels that wall in this broad\r\navenue are mean, and cheap, and dingy, and are better left without\r\ncomment. Beyond the Treasury is a fine large white barn, with wide\r\nunhandsome grounds about it. The President lives there. It is ugly\r\nenough outside, but that is nothing to what it is inside. Dreariness,\r\nflimsiness, bad taste reduced to mathematical completeness is what the\r\ninside offers to the eye, if it remains yet what it always has been.\r\n\r\nThe front and right hand views give you the city at large. It is a\r\nwide stretch of cheap little brick houses, with here and there a\r\nnoble architectural pile lifting itself out of the midst--government\r\nbuildings, these. If the thaw is still going on when you come down and\r\ngo about town, you will wonder at the short-sightedness of the city\r\nfathers, when you come to inspect the streets, in that they do not\r\ndilute the mud a little more and use them for canals.\r\n\r\nIf you inquire around a little, you will find that there are more\r\nboardinghouses to the square acre in Washington than there are in any\r\nother city in the land, perhaps. If you apply for a home in one of them,\r\nit will seem odd to you to have the landlady inspect you with a severe\r\neye and then ask you if you are a member of Congress. Perhaps, just as\r\na pleasantry, you will say yes. And then she will tell you that she is\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfull.\xe2\x80\x9d Then you show her her advertisement in the morning paper, and\r\nthere she stands, convicted and ashamed. She will try to blush, and it\r\nwill be only polite in you to take the effort for the deed. She shows\r\nyou her rooms, now, and lets you take one--but she makes you pay in\r\nadvance for it. That is what you will get for pretending to be a member\r\nof Congress. If you had been content to be merely a private citizen,\r\nyour trunk would have been sufficient security for your board. If you\r\nare curious and inquire into this thing, the chances are that your\r\nlandlady will be ill-natured enough to say that the person and property\r\nof a Congressman are exempt from arrest or detention, and that with the\r\ntears in her eyes she has seen several of the people's representatives\r\nwalk off to their several States and Territories carrying her\r\nunreceipted board bills in their pockets for keepsakes. And before you\r\nhave been in Washington many weeks you will be mean enough to believe\r\nher, too.\r\n\r\nOf course you contrive to see everything and find out everything. And\r\none of the first and most startling things you find out is, that every\r\nindividual you encounter in the City of Washington almost--and certainly\r\nevery separate and distinct individual in the public employment, from\r\nthe highest bureau chief, clear down to the maid who scrubs Department\r\nhalls, the night watchmen of the public buildings and the darkey boy\r\nwho purifies the Department spittoons--represents Political Influence.\r\nUnless you can get the ear of a Senator, or a Congressman, or a Chief of\r\na Bureau or Department, and persuade him to use his \xe2\x80\x9cinfluence\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\nyour behalf, you cannot get an employment of the most trivial nature in\r\nWashington. Mere merit, fitness and capability, are useless baggage to\r\nyou without \xe2\x80\x9cinfluence.\xe2\x80\x9d The population of Washington consists pretty\r\nmuch entirely of government employees and the people who board them.\r\nThere are thousands of these employees, and they have gathered there\r\nfrom every corner of the Union and got their berths through the\r\nintercession (command is nearer the word) of the Senators and\r\nRepresentatives of their respective States. It would be an odd\r\ncircumstance to see a girl get employment at three or four dollars a\r\nweek in one of the great public cribs without any political grandee to\r\nback her, but merely because she was worthy, and competent, and a good\r\ncitizen of a free country that \xe2\x80\x9ctreats all persons alike.\xe2\x80\x9d Washington\r\nwould be mildly thunderstruck at such a thing as that. If you are a\r\nmember of Congress, (no offence,) and one of your constituents who\r\ndoesn't know anything, and does not want to go into the bother of\r\nlearning something, and has no money, and no employment, and can't earn\r\na living, comes besieging you for help, do you say, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, my friend,\r\nif your services were valuable you could get employment elsewhere--don't\r\nwant you here?\xe2\x80\x9d Oh, no: You take him to a Department and say, \xe2\x80\x9cHere,\r\ngive this person something to pass away the time at--and a salary\xe2\x80\x9d--and\r\nthe thing is done. You throw him on his country. He is his country's\r\nchild, let his country support him. There is something good and motherly\r\nabout Washington, the grand old benevolent National Asylum for the\r\nHelpless.\r\n\r\nThe wages received by this great hive of employees are placed at the\r\nliberal figure meet and just for skilled and competent labor. Such of\r\nthem as are immediately employed about the two Houses of Congress, are\r\nnot only liberally paid also, but are remembered in the customary\r\nExtra Compensation bill which slides neatly through, annually, with\r\nthe general grab that signalizes the last night of a session, and thus\r\ntwenty per cent. is added to their wages, for--for fun, no doubt.\r\n\r\nWashington Hawkins' new life was an unceasing delight to him.\r\nSenator Dilworthy lived sumptuously, and Washington's quarters were\r\ncharming--gas; running water, hot and cold; bath-room, coal-fires, rich\r\ncarpets, beautiful pictures on the walls; books on religion, temperance,\r\npublic charities and financial schemes; trim colored servants, dainty\r\nfood--everything a body could wish for. And as for stationery, there\r\nwas no end to it; the government furnished it; postage stamps were not\r\nneeded--the Senator's frank could convey a horse through the mails, if\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nAnd then he saw such dazzling company. Renowned generals and admirals\r\nwho had seemed but colossal myths when he was in the far west, went\r\nin and out before him or sat at the Senator's table, solidified into\r\npalpable flesh and blood; famous statesmen crossed his path daily; that\r\nonce rare and awe-inspiring being, a Congressman, was become a common\r\nspectacle--a spectacle so common, indeed, that he could contemplate it\r\nwithout excitement, even without embarrassment; foreign ministers were\r\nvisible to the naked eye at happy intervals; he had looked upon the\r\nPresident himself, and lived. And more; this world of enchantment teemed\r\nwith speculation--the whole atmosphere was thick with it--and that\r\nindeed was Washington Hawkins' native air; none other refreshed his\r\nlungs so gratefully. He had found paradise at last.\r\n\r\nThe more he saw of his chief the Senator, the more he honored him, and\r\nthe more conspicuously the moral grandeur of his character appeared to\r\nstand out. To possess the friendship and the kindly interest of such a\r\nman, Washington said in a letter to Louise, was a happy fortune for a\r\nyoung man whose career had been so impeded and so clouded as his.\r\n\r\nThe weeks drifted by;--Harry Brierly flirted, danced, added lustre\r\nto the brilliant Senatorial receptions, and diligently \xe2\x80\x9cbuzzed\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbutton-holed\xe2\x80\x9d Congressmen in the interest of the Columbus River scheme;\r\nmeantime Senator Dilworthy labored hard in the same interest--and in\r\nothers of equal national importance. Harry wrote frequently to Sellers,\r\nand always encouragingly; and from these letters it was easy to see that\r\nHarry was a pet with all Washington, and was likely to carry the thing\r\nthrough; that the assistance rendered him by \xe2\x80\x9cold Dilworthy\xe2\x80\x9d was pretty\r\nfair--pretty fair; \xe2\x80\x9cand every little helps, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry.\r\n\r\nWashington wrote Sellers officially, now and then. In one of his letters\r\nit appeared that whereas no member of the House committee favored the\r\nscheme at first, there was now needed but one more vote to compass a\r\nmajority report. Closing sentence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProvidence seems to further our efforts.\xe2\x80\x9d (Signed,) \xe2\x80\x9cABNER DILWORTHY,\r\nU. S. S.,\r\n\r\nper WASHINGTON HAWKINS, P. S.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the end of a week, Washington was able to send the happy news,\r\nofficially, as usual,--that the needed vote had been added and the bill\r\nfavorably reported from the Committee. Other letters recorded its perils\r\nin Committee of the whole, and by and by its victory, by just the skin\r\nof its teeth, on third reading and final passage. Then came letters\r\ntelling of Mr. Dilworthy's struggles with a stubborn majority in his own\r\nCommittee in the Senate; of how these gentlemen succumbed, one by one,\r\ntill a majority was secured.\r\n\r\nThen there was a hiatus. Washington watched every move on the board,\r\nand he was in a good position to do this, for he was clerk of this\r\ncommittee, and also one other. He received no salary as private\r\nsecretary, but these two clerkships, procured by his benefactor, paid\r\nhim an aggregate of twelve dollars a day, without counting the twenty\r\npercent extra compensation which would of course be voted to him on the\r\nlast night of the session.\r\n\r\nHe saw the bill go into Committee of the whole and struggle for its life\r\nagain, and finally worry through. In the fullness of time he noted its\r\nsecond reading, and by and by the day arrived when the grand ordeal\r\ncame, and it was put upon its final passage. Washington listened with\r\nbated breath to the \xe2\x80\x9cAye!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAye!\xe2\x80\x9d of the voters, for a few\r\ndread minutes, and then could bear the suspense no longer. He ran down\r\nfrom the gallery and hurried home to wait.\r\n\r\nAt the end of two or three hours the Senator arrived in the bosom of\r\nhis family, and dinner was waiting. Washington sprang forward, with the\r\neager question on his lips, and the Senator said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe may rejoice freely, now, my son--Providence has crowned our efforts\r\nwith success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nWashington sent grand good news to Col. Sellers that night. To Louise he\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is beautiful to hear him talk when his heart is full of thankfulness\r\nfor some manifestation of the Divine favor. You shall know him, some day\r\nmy Louise, and knowing him you will honor him, as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry wrote:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pulled it through, Colonel, but it was a tough job, there is no\r\nquestion about that. There was not a friend to the measure in the House\r\ncommittee when I began, and not a friend in the Senate committee except\r\nold Dil himself, but they were all fixed for a majority report when I\r\nhauled off my forces. Everybody here says you can't get a thing like\r\nthis through Congress without buying committees for straight-out cash on\r\ndelivery, but I think I've taught them a thing or two--if I could only\r\nmake them believe it. When I tell the old residenters that this thing\r\nwent through without buying a vote or making a promise, they say,\r\n'That's rather too thin.' And when I say thin or not thin it's a fact,\r\nanyway, they say, 'Come, now, but do you really believe that?' and when\r\nI say I don't believe anything about it, I know it, they smile and\r\nsay, 'Well, you are pretty innocent, or pretty blind, one or the\r\nother--there's no getting around that.' Why they really do believe that\r\nvotes have been bought--they do indeed. But let them keep on thinking\r\nso. I have found out that if a man knows how to talk to women, and has\r\na little gift in the way of argument with men, he can afford to play for\r\nan appropriation against a money bag and give the money bag odds in\r\nthe game. We've raked in $200,000 of Uncle Sam's money, say what they\r\nwill--and there is more where this came from, when we want it, and I\r\nrather fancy I am the person that can go in and occupy it, too, if I do\r\nsay it myself, that shouldn't, perhaps. I'll be with you within a week.\r\nScare up all the men you can, and put them to work at once. When I get\r\nthere I propose to make things hum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe great news lifted Sellers into the clouds. He went to work on the\r\ninstant. He flew hither and thither making contracts, engaging men, and\r\nsteeping his soul in the ecstasies of business. He was the happiest man\r\nin Missouri. And Louise was the happiest woman; for presently came a\r\nletter from Washington which said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRejoice with me, for the long agony is over! We have waited patiently\r\nand faithfully, all these years, and now at last the reward is at hand.\r\nA man is to pay our family $40,000 for the Tennessee Land! It is but a\r\nlittle sum compared to what we could get by waiting, but I do so long\r\nto see the day when I can call you my own, that I have said to myself,\r\nbetter take this and enjoy life in a humble way than wear out our best\r\ndays in this miserable separation. Besides, I can put this money into\r\noperations here that will increase it a hundred fold, yes, a thousand\r\nfold, in a few months. The air is full of such chances, and I know our\r\nfamily would consent in a moment that I should put in their shares with\r\nmine. Without a doubt we shall be worth half a million dollars in a year\r\nfrom this time--I put it at the very lowest figure, because it is\r\nalways best to be on the safe side--half a million at the very lowest\r\ncalculation, and then your father will give his consent and we can marry\r\nat last. Oh, that will be a glorious day. Tell our friends the good\r\nnews--I want all to share it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she did tell her father and mother, but they said, let it be\r\nkept still for the present. The careful father also told her to write\r\nWashington and warn him not to speculate with the money, but to wait a\r\nlittle and advise with one or two wise old heads. She did this. And she\r\nmanaged to keep the good news to herself, though it would seem that the\r\nmost careless observer might have seen by her springing step and her\r\nradiant countenance that some fine piece of good fortune had descended\r\nupon her.\r\n\r\nHarry joined the Colonel at Stone's Landing, and that dead place sprang\r\ninto sudden life. A swarm of men were hard at work, and the dull air\r\nwas filled with the cheery music of labor. Harry had been constituted\r\nengineer-in-general, and he threw the full strength of his powers into\r\nhis work. He moved among his hirelings like a king. Authority seemed to\r\ninvest him with a new splendor. Col. Sellers, as general superintendent\r\nof a great public enterprise, was all that a mere human being could\r\nbe--and more. These two grandees went at their imposing \xe2\x80\x9cimprovement\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n with the air of men who had been charged with the work of altering the\r\nfoundations of the globe.\r\n\r\nThey turned their first attention to straightening the river just above\r\nthe Landing, where it made a deep bend, and where the maps and plans\r\nshowed that the process of straightening would not only shorten distance\r\nbut increase the \xe2\x80\x9cfall.\xe2\x80\x9d They started a cut-off canal across the\r\npeninsula formed by the bend, and such another tearing up of the earth\r\nand slopping around in the mud as followed the order to the men, had\r\nnever been seen in that region before. There was such a panic among\r\nthe turtles that at the end of six hours there was not one to be found\r\nwithin three miles of Stone's Landing. They took the young and the aged,\r\nthe decrepit and the sick upon their backs and left for tide-water\r\nin disorderly procession, the tadpoles following and the bull-frogs\r\nbringing up the rear.\r\n\r\nSaturday night came, but the men were obliged to wait, because the\r\nappropriation had not come. Harry said he had written to hurry up the\r\nmoney and it would be along presently. So the work continued, on Monday.\r\nStone's Landing was making quite a stir in the vicinity, by this time.\r\nSellers threw a lot or two on the market, \xe2\x80\x9cas a feeler,\xe2\x80\x9d and they sold\r\nwell. He re-clothed his family, laid in a good stock of provisions, and\r\nstill had money left. He started a bank account, in a small way--and\r\nmentioned the deposit casually to friends; and to strangers, too; to\r\neverybody, in fact; but not as a new thing--on the contrary, as a matter\r\nof life-long standing. He could not keep from buying trifles every day\r\nthat were not wholly necessary, it was such a gaudy thing to get out his\r\nbank-book and draw a check, instead of using his old customary formula,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharge it!\xe2\x80\x9d Harry sold a lot or two, also--and had a dinner party or\r\ntwo at Hawkeye and a general good time with the money. Both men held on\r\npretty strenuously for the coming big prices, however.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a month things were looking bad. Harry had besieged the\r\nNew York headquarters of the Columbus River Slack-water Navigation\r\nCompany with demands, then commands, and finally appeals, but to no\r\npurpose; the appropriation did not come; the letters were not even\r\nanswered. The workmen were clamorous, now. The Colonel and Harry retired\r\nto consult.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang'd if I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompany say anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou telegraphed yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and the day before, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo answer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone-confound them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen there was a long pause. Finally both spoke at once:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI've got it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI've got it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat's yours?\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive the boys thirty-day orders on the Company for the back pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's it-that's my own idea to a dot. But then--but then----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel; \xe2\x80\x9cI know they can't wait for the orders\r\nto go to New York and be cashed, but what's the reason they can't get\r\nthem discounted in Hawkeye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course they can. That solves the difficulty. Everybody knows the\r\nappropriation's been made and the Company's perfectly good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the orders were given and the men appeased, though they grumbled\r\na little at first. The orders went well enough for groceries and such\r\nthings at a fair discount, and the work danced along gaily for a time.\r\nTwo or three purchasers put up frame houses at the Landing and moved in,\r\nand of course a far-sighted but easy-going journeyman printer\r\nwandered along and started the \xe2\x80\x9cNapoleon Weekly Telegraph and Literary\r\nRepository\xe2\x80\x9d--a paper with a Latin motto from the Unabridged dictionary,\r\nand plenty of \xe2\x80\x9cfat\xe2\x80\x9d conversational tales and double-leaded poetry--all\r\nfor two dollars a year, strictly in advance. Of course the merchants\r\nforwarded the orders at once to New York--and never heard of them again.\r\n\r\nAt the end of some weeks Harry's orders were a drug in the\r\nmarket--nobody would take them at any discount whatever. The second\r\nmonth closed with a riot.--Sellers was absent at the time, and Harry\r\nbegan an active absence himself with the mob at his heels. But being on\r\nhorseback, he had the advantage. He did not tarry in Hawkeye, but went\r\non, thus missing several appointments with creditors. He was far on his\r\nflight eastward, and well out of danger when the next morning dawned. He\r\ntelegraphed the Colonel to go down and quiet the laborers--he was\r\nbound east for money--everything would be right in a week--tell the men\r\nso--tell them to rely on him and not be afraid.\r\n\r\nSellers found the mob quiet enough when he reached the Landing. They\r\nhad gutted the Navigation office, then piled the beautiful engraved\r\nstock-books and things in the middle of the floor and enjoyed the\r\nbonfire while it lasted. They had a liking for the Colonel, but still\r\nthey had some idea of hanging him, as a sort of make-shift that might\r\nanswer, after a fashion, in place of more satisfactory game.\r\n\r\nBut they made the mistake of waiting to hear what he had to say first.\r\nWithin fifteen minutes his tongue had done its work and they were all\r\nrich men.--He gave every one of them a lot in the suburbs of the city of\r\nStone's Landing, within a mile and a half of the future post office and\r\nrailway station, and they promised to resume work as soon as Harry got\r\neast and started the money along. Now things were blooming and pleasant\r\nagain, but the men had no money, and nothing to live on. The Colonel\r\ndivided with them the money he still had in bank--an act which had\r\nnothing surprising about it because he was generally ready to divide\r\nwhatever he had with anybody that wanted it, and it was owing to this\r\nvery trait that his family spent their days in poverty and at times were\r\npinched with famine.\r\n\r\nWhen the men's minds had cooled and Sellers was gone, they hated\r\nthemselves for letting him beguile them with fine speeches, but it\r\nwas too late, now--they agreed to hang him another time--such time as\r\nProvidence should appoint.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nRumors of Ruth's frivolity and worldliness at Fallkill traveled to\r\nPhiladelphia in due time, and occasioned no little undertalk among the\r\nBolton relatives.\r\n\r\nHannah Shoecraft told another cousin that, for her part, she never\r\nbelieved that Ruth had so much more \xe2\x80\x9cmind\xe2\x80\x9d than other people; and Cousin\r\nHulda added that she always thought Ruth was fond of admiration, and\r\nthat was the reason she was unwilling to wear plain clothes and attend\r\nMeeting. The story that Ruth was \xe2\x80\x9cengaged\xe2\x80\x9d to a young gentleman of\r\nfortune in Fallkill came with the other news, and helped to give point\r\nto the little satirical remarks that went round about Ruth's desire to\r\nbe a doctor!\r\n\r\nMargaret Bolton was too wise to be either surprised or alarmed by these\r\nrumors. They might be true; she knew a woman's nature too well to\r\nthink them improbable, but she also knew how steadfast Ruth was in her\r\npurposes, and that, as a brook breaks into ripples and eddies and dances\r\nand sports by the way, and yet keeps on to the sea, it was in Ruth's\r\nnature to give back cheerful answer to the solicitations of friendliness\r\nand pleasure, to appear idly delaying even, and sporting in the\r\nsunshine, while the current of her resolution flowed steadily on.\r\n\r\nThat Ruth had this delight in the mere surface play of life that she\r\ncould, for instance, be interested in that somewhat serious by-play\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9cflirtation,\xe2\x80\x9d or take any delight in the exercise of those\r\nlittle arts of pleasing and winning which are none the less genuine and\r\ncharming because they are not intellectual, Ruth, herself, had never\r\nsuspected until she went to Fallkill. She had believed it her duty to\r\nsubdue her gaiety of temperament, and let nothing divert her from what\r\nare called serious pursuits: In her limited experience she brought\r\neverything to the judgment of her own conscience, and settled the\r\naffairs of all the world in her own serene judgment hall. Perhaps her\r\nmother saw this, and saw also that there was nothing in the Friends'\r\nsociety to prevent her from growing more and more opinionated.\r\n\r\nWhen Ruth returned to Philadelphia, it must be confessed--though it\r\nwould not have been by her--that a medical career did seem a little less\r\nnecessary for her than formerly; and coming back in a glow of triumph,\r\nas it were, and in the consciousness of the freedom and life in a lively\r\nsociety and in new and sympathetic friendship, she anticipated pleasure\r\nin an attempt to break up the stiffness and levelness of the society\r\nat home, and infusing into it something of the motion and sparkle which\r\nwere so agreeable at Fallkill. She expected visits from her new friends,\r\nshe would have company, the new books and the periodicals about which\r\nall the world was talking, and, in short, she would have life.\r\n\r\nFor a little while she lived in this atmosphere which she had brought\r\nwith her. Her mother was delighted with this change in her, with\r\nthe improvement in her health and the interest she exhibited in home\r\naffairs. Her father enjoyed the society of his favorite daughter as he\r\ndid few things besides; he liked her mirthful and teasing ways, and\r\nnot less a keen battle over something she had read. He had been a great\r\nreader all his life, and a remarkable memory had stored his mind with\r\nencyclopaedic information. It was one of Ruth's delights to cram herself\r\nwith some out of the way subject and endeavor to catch her father; but\r\nshe almost always failed. Mr. Bolton liked company, a house full of it,\r\nand the mirth of young people, and he would have willingly entered\r\ninto any revolutionary plans Ruth might have suggested in relation to\r\nFriends' society.\r\n\r\nBut custom and the fixed order are stronger than the most enthusiastic\r\nand rebellious young lady, as Ruth very soon found. In spite of all\r\nher brave efforts, her frequent correspondence, and her determined\r\nanimation, her books and her music, she found herself settling into the\r\nclutches of the old monotony, and as she realized the hopelessness of\r\nher endeavors, the medical scheme took new hold of her, and seemed to\r\nher the only method of escape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, thee does not know how different it is in Fallkill, how much\r\nmore interesting the people are one meets, how much more life there is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut thee will find the world, child, pretty much all the same, when\r\nthee knows it better. I thought once as thee does now, and had as little\r\nthought of being a Friend as thee has. Perhaps when thee has seen more,\r\nthee will better appreciate a quiet life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee married young. I shall not marry young, and perhaps not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Ruth, with a look of vast experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps thee doesn't know thee own mind; I have known persons of thy\r\nage who did not. Did thee see anybody whom thee would like to live with\r\nalways in Fallkill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot always,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ruth with a little laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cMother, I think I\r\nwouldn't say 'always' to any one until I have a profession and am as\r\nindependent as he is. Then my love would be a free act, and not in any\r\nway a necessity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMargaret Bolton smiled at this new-fangled philosophy. \xe2\x80\x9cThee will find\r\nthat love, Ruth, is a thing thee won't reason about, when it comes,\r\nnor make any bargains about. Thee wrote that Philip Sterling was at\r\nFallkill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and Henry Brierly, a friend of his; a very amusing young fellow\r\nand not so serious-minded as Philip, but a bit of a fop maybe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thee preferred the fop to the serious-minded?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn't prefer anybody; but Henry Brierly was good company, which\r\nPhilip wasn't always.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid thee know thee father had been in correspondence with Philip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth looked up surprised and with a plain question in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it's not about thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then?\xe2\x80\x9d and if there was any shade of disappointment in her tone,\r\nprobably Ruth herself did not know it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's about some land up in the country. That man Bigler has got father\r\ninto another speculation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat odious man! Why will father have anything to do with him? Is it\r\nthat railroad?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Father advanced money and took land as security, and whatever has\r\ngone with the money and the bonds, he has on his hands a large tract of\r\nwild land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what has Philip to do with that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has good timber, if it could ever be got out, and father says that\r\nthere must be coal in it; it's in a coal region. He wants Philip to\r\nsurvey it, and examine it for indications of coal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's another of father's fortunes, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ruth. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has put\r\naway so many fortunes for us that I'm afraid we never shall find them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth was interested in it nevertheless, and perhaps mainly because\r\nPhilip was to be connected with the enterprise. Mr. Bigler came to\r\ndinner with her father next day, and talked a great deal about Mr.\r\nBolton's magnificent tract of land, extolled the sagacity that led him\r\nto secure such a property, and led the talk along to another railroad\r\nwhich would open a northern communication to this very land.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPennybacker says it's full of coal, he's no doubt of it, and a railroad\r\nto strike the Erie would make it a fortune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you take the land and work the thing up, Mr. Bigler; you may\r\nhave the tract for three dollars an acre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'd throw it away, then,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bigler, \xe2\x80\x9cand I'm not the man to\r\ntake advantage of a friend. But if you'll put a mortgage on it for the\r\nnorthern road, I wouldn't mind taking an interest, if Pennybacker is\r\nwilling; but Pennybacker, you know, don't go much on land, he sticks to\r\nthe legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d And Mr. Bigler laughed.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Bigler had gone, Ruth asked her father about Philip's\r\nconnection with the land scheme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's nothing definite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bolton. \xe2\x80\x9cPhilip is showing aptitude\r\nfor his profession. I hear the best reports of him in New York, though\r\nthose sharpers don't intend to do anything but use him. I've written and\r\noffered him employment in surveying and examining the land. We want to\r\nknow what it is. And if there is anything in it that his enterprise can\r\ndig out, he shall have an interest. I should be glad to give the young\r\nfellow a lift.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll his life Eli Bolton had been giving young fellows a lift, and\r\nshouldering the loses when things turned out unfortunately. His ledger,\r\ntake-it-altogether, would not show a balance on the right side; but\r\nperhaps the losses on his books will turn out to be credits in a world\r\nwhere accounts are kept on a different basis. The left hand of the\r\nledger will appear the right, looked at from the other side.\r\n\r\nPhilip, wrote to Ruth rather a comical account of the bursting up of\r\nthe city of Napoleon and the navigation improvement scheme, of Harry's\r\nflight and the Colonel's discomfiture. Harry left in such a hurry that\r\nhe hadn't even time to bid Miss Laura Hawkins good-bye, but he had no\r\ndoubt that Harry would console himself with the next pretty face he\r\nsaw--a remark which was thrown in for Ruth's benefit. Col. Sellers\r\nhad in all probability, by this time, some other equally brilliant\r\nspeculation in his brain.\r\n\r\nAs to the railroad, Philip had made up his mind that it was merely kept\r\non foot for speculative purposes in Wall street, and he was about to\r\nquit it. Would Ruth be glad to hear, he wondered, that he was coming\r\nEast? For he was coming, in spite of a letter from Harry in New York,\r\nadvising him to hold on until he had made some arrangements in regard\r\nto contracts, he to be a little careful about Sellers, who was somewhat\r\nvisionary, Harry said.\r\n\r\nThe summer went on without much excitement for Ruth. She kept up a\r\ncorrespondence with Alice, who promised a visit in the fall, she read,\r\nshe earnestly tried to interest herself in home affairs and such people\r\nas came to the house; but she found herself falling more and more\r\ninto reveries, and growing weary of things as they were. She felt\r\nthat everybody might become in time like two relatives from a Shaker\r\nestablishment in Ohio, who visited the Boltons about this time, a father\r\nand son, clad exactly alike, and alike in manners. The son; however, who\r\nwas not of age, was more unworldly and sanctimonious than his father;\r\nhe always addressed his parent as \xe2\x80\x9cBrother Plum,\xe2\x80\x9d and bore himself,\r\naltogether in such a superior manner that Ruth longed to put bent\r\npins in his chair. Both father and son wore the long, single breasted\r\ncollarless coats of their society, without buttons, before or behind,\r\nbut with a row of hooks and eyes on either side in front. It was Ruth's\r\nsuggestion that the coats would be improved by a single hook and eye\r\nsewed on in the small of the back where the buttons usually are.\r\n\r\nAmusing as this Shaker caricature of the Friends was, it oppressed Ruth\r\nbeyond measure; and increased her feeling of being stifled.\r\n\r\nIt was a most unreasonable feeling. No home could be pleasanter than\r\nRuth's. The house, a little out of the city; was one of those elegant\r\ncountry residences which so much charm visitors to the suburbs of\r\nPhiladelphia. A modern dwelling and luxurious in everything that wealth\r\ncould suggest for comfort, it stood in the midst of exquisitely kept\r\nlawns, with groups of trees, parterres of flowers massed in colors, with\r\ngreenhouse, grapery and garden; and on one side, the garden sloped away\r\nin undulations to a shallow brook that ran over a pebbly bottom and sang\r\nunder forest trees. The country about was the perfection of cultivated\r\nlandscape, dotted with cottages, and stately mansions of Revolutionary\r\ndate, and sweet as an English country-side, whether seen in the soft\r\nbloom of May or in the mellow ripeness of late October.\r\n\r\nIt needed only the peace of the mind within, to make it a paradise. One\r\nriding by on the Old Germantown road, and seeing a young girl swinging\r\nin the hammock on the piazza and, intent upon some volume of old poetry\r\nor the latest novel, would no doubt have envied a life so idyllic. He\r\ncould not have imagined that the young girl was reading a volume of\r\nreports of clinics and longing to be elsewhere.\r\n\r\nRuth could not have been more discontented if all the wealth about her\r\nhad been as unsubstantial as a dream. Perhaps she so thought it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel,\xe2\x80\x9d she once said to her father, \xe2\x80\x9cas if I were living in a house\r\nof cards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thee would like to turn it into a hospital?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. But tell me father,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Ruth, not to be put off, \xe2\x80\x9cis thee\r\nstill going on with that Bigler and those other men who come here and\r\nentice thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bolton smiled, as men do when they talk with women about \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch men have their uses, Ruth. They keep the world active, and I owe a\r\ngreat many of my best operations to such men. Who knows, Ruth, but this\r\nnew land purchase, which I confess I yielded a little too much to Bigler\r\nin, may not turn out a fortune for thee and the rest of the children?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, father, thee sees every thing in a rose-colored light. I do believe\r\nthee wouldn't have so readily allowed me to begin the study of medicine,\r\nif it hadn't had the novelty of an experiment to thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is thee satisfied with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf thee means, if I have had enough of it, no. I just begin to see what\r\nI can do in it, and what a noble profession it is for a woman. Would\r\nthee have me sit here like a bird on a bough and wait for somebody to\r\ncome and put me in a cage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bolton was not sorry to divert the talk from his own affairs, and\r\nhe did not think it worth while to tell his family of a performance that\r\nvery day which was entirely characteristic of him.\r\n\r\nRuth might well say that she felt as if she were living in a house of\r\ncards, although the Bolton household had no idea of the number of perils\r\nthat hovered over them, any more than thousands of families in America\r\nhave of the business risks and contingences upon which their prosperity\r\nand luxury hang.\r\n\r\nA sudden call upon Mr. Bolton for a large sum of money, which must be\r\nforthcoming at once, had found him in the midst of a dozen ventures,\r\nfrom no one of which a dollar could be realized. It was in vain that he\r\napplied to his business acquaintances and friends; it was a period\r\nof sudden panic and no money. \xe2\x80\x9cA hundred thousand! Mr. Bolton,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPlumly. \xe2\x80\x9cGood God, if you should ask me for ten, I shouldn't know where\r\nto get it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd yet that day Mr. Small (Pennybacker, Bigler and Small) came to Mr.\r\nBolton with a piteous story of ruin in a coal operation, if he could\r\nnot raise ten thousand dollars. Only ten, and he was sure of a fortune.\r\nWithout it he was a beggar. Mr. Bolton had already Small's notes for a\r\nlarge amount in his safe, labeled \xe2\x80\x9cdoubtful;\xe2\x80\x9d he had helped him again\r\nand again, and always with the same result. But Mr. Small spoke with a\r\nfaltering voice of his family, his daughter in school, his wife ignorant\r\nof his calamity, and drew such a picture of their agony, that Mr. Bolton\r\nput by his own more pressing necessity, and devoted the day to scraping\r\ntogether, here and there, ten thousand dollars for this brazen beggar,\r\nwho had never kept a promise to him nor paid a debt.\r\n\r\nBeautiful credit! The foundation of modern society. Who shall say that\r\nthis is not the golden age of mutual trust, of unlimited reliance upon\r\nhuman promises? That is a peculiar condition of society which enables\r\na whole nation to instantly recognize point and meaning in the familiar\r\nnewspaper anecdote, which puts into the mouth of a distinguished\r\nspeculator in lands and mines this remark:--\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn't worth a cent two\r\nyears ago, and now I owe two millions of dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nIt was a hard blow to poor Sellers to see the work on his darling\r\nenterprise stop, and the noise and bustle and confusion that had been\r\nsuch refreshment to his soul, sicken and die out. It was hard to come\r\ndown to humdrum ordinary life again after being a General Superintendent\r\nand the most conspicuous man in the community. It was sad to see his\r\nname disappear from the newspapers; sadder still to see it resurrected\r\nat intervals, shorn of its aforetime gaudy gear of compliments and\r\nclothed on with rhetorical tar and feathers.\r\n\r\nBut his friends suffered more on his account than he did. He was a cork\r\nthat could not be kept under the water many moments at a time.\r\n\r\nHe had to bolster up his wife's spirits every now and then. On one of\r\nthese occasions he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's all right, my dear, all right; it will all come right in a little\r\nwhile. There's $200,000 coming, and that will set things booming again:\r\nHarry seems to be having some difficulty, but that's to be expected--you\r\ncan't move these big operations to the tune of Fisher's Hornpipe, you\r\nknow. But Harry will get it started along presently, and then you'll\r\nsee! I expect the news every day now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Beriah, you've been expecting it every day, all along, haven't\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes; yes--I don't know but I have. But anyway, the longer it's\r\ndelayed, the nearer it grows to the time when it will start--same as\r\nevery day you live brings you nearer to--nearer--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe grave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no--not that exactly; but you can't understand these things,\r\nPolly dear--women haven't much head for business, you know. You make\r\nyourself perfectly comfortable, old lady, and you'll see how we'll trot\r\nthis right along. Why bless you, let the appropriation lag, if it wants\r\nto--that's no great matter--there's a bigger thing than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBigger than $200,000, Beriah?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBigger, child?--why, what's $200,000? Pocket money! Mere pocket money!\r\nLook at the railroad! Did you forget the railroad? It ain't many months\r\ntill spring; it will be coming right along, and the railroad swimming\r\nright along behind it. Where'll it be by the middle of summer? Just stop\r\nand fancy a moment--just think a little--don't anything suggest itself?\r\nBless your heart, you dear women live right in the present all the\r\ntime--but a man, why a man lives----\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the future, Beriah? But don't we live in the future most too much,\r\nBeriah? We do somehow seem to manage to live on next year's crop of corn\r\nand potatoes as a general thing while this year is still dragging along,\r\nbut sometimes it's not a robust diet,--Beriah. But don't look that\r\nway, dear--don't mind what I say. I don't mean to fret, I don't mean to\r\nworry; and I don't, once a month, do I, dear? But when I get a little\r\nlow and feel bad, I get a bit troubled and worrisome, but it don't mean\r\nanything in the world. It passes right away. I know you're doing all\r\nyou can, and I don't want to seem repining and ungrateful--for I'm not,\r\nBeriah--you know I'm not, don't you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord bless you, child, I know you are the very best little woman that\r\never lived--that ever lived on the whole face of the Earth! And I know\r\nthat I would be a dog not to work for you and think for you and\r\nscheme for you with all my might. And I'll bring things all right yet,\r\nhoney--cheer up and don't you fear. The railroad----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I had forgotten the railroad, dear, but when a body gets blue, a\r\nbody forgets everything. Yes, the railroad--tell me about the railroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha, my girl, don't you see? Things ain't so dark, are they? Now I\r\ndidn't forget the railroad. Now just think for a moment--just figure up\r\na little on the future dead moral certainties. For instance, call this\r\nwaiter St. Louis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we'll lay this fork (representing the railroad) from St. Louis to\r\nthis potato, which is Slouchburg:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen with this carving knife we'll continue the railroad from\r\nSlouchburg to Doodleville, shown by the black pepper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen we run along the--yes--the comb--to the tumbler that's Brimstone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThence by the pipe to Belshazzar, which is the salt-cellar:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThence to, to--that quill--Catfish--hand me the pincushion, Marie\r\nAntoinette:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThence right along these shears to this horse, Babylon:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen by the spoon to Bloody Run--thank you, the ink:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThence to Hail Columbia--snuffers, Polly, please move that cup and\r\nsaucer close up, that's Hail Columbia:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen--let me open my knife--to Hark-from-the-Tomb, where we'll put\r\nthe candle-stick--only a little distance from Hail Columbia to\r\nHark-from-the-Tomb--down-grade all the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there we strike Columbus River--pass me two or three skeins of\r\nthread to stand for the river; the sugar bowl will do for Hawkeye, and\r\nthe rat trap for Stone's Landing--Napoleon, I mean--and you can see how\r\nmuch better Napoleon is located than Hawkeye. Now here you are with your\r\nrailroad complete, and showing its continuation to Hallelujah and thence\r\nto Corruptionville.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then--there you are! It's a beautiful road, beautiful. Jeff\r\nThompson can out-engineer any civil engineer that ever sighted through\r\nan aneroid, or a theodolite, or whatever they call it--he calls it\r\nsometimes one and sometimes the other just whichever levels off his\r\nsentence neatest, I reckon. But ain't it a ripping road, though? I tell\r\nyou, it'll make a stir when it gets along. Just see what a country it\r\ngoes through. There's your onions at Slouchburg--noblest onion country\r\nthat graces God's footstool; and there's your turnip country all around\r\nDoodleville--bless my life, what fortunes are going to be made there\r\nwhen they get that contrivance perfected for extracting olive oil out of\r\nturnips--if there's any in them; and I reckon there is, because Congress\r\nhas made an appropriation of money to test the thing, and they wouldn't\r\nhave done that just on conjecture, of course. And now we come to the\r\nBrimstone region--cattle raised there till you can't rest--and corn, and\r\nall that sort of thing. Then you've got a little stretch along through\r\nBelshazzar that don't produce anything now--at least nothing but\r\nrocks--but irrigation will fetch it. Then from Catfish to Babylon it's\r\na little swampy, but there's dead loads of peat down under there\r\nsomewhere. Next is the Bloody Run and Hail Columbia country--tobacco\r\nenough can be raised there to support two such railroads. Next is the\r\nsassparilla region. I reckon there's enough of that truck along in there\r\non the line of the pocket-knife, from Hail Columbia to Hark-from-the\r\nTomb to fat up all the consumptives in all the hospitals from Halifax\r\nto the Holy Land. It just grows like weeds! I've got a little belt of\r\nsassparilla land in there just tucked away unobstrusively waiting for my\r\nlittle Universal Expectorant to get into shape in my head. And I'll fix\r\nthat, you know. One of these days I'll have all the nations of the earth\r\nexpecto--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Beriah, dear--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't interrupt me; Polly--I don't want you to lose the run of the\r\nmap--well, take your toy-horse, James Fitz-James, if you must have\r\nit--and run along with you. Here, now--the soap will do for Babylon.\r\nLet me see--where was I? Oh yes--now we run down to Stone's\r\nLan--Napoleon--now we run down to Napoleon. Beautiful road. Look at\r\nthat, now. Perfectly straight line-straight as the way to the grave.\r\n\r\nAnd see where it leaves Hawkeye-clear out in the cold, my dear, clear\r\nout in the cold. That town's as bound to die as--well if I owned it I'd\r\nget its obituary ready, now, and notify the mourners. Polly, mark my\r\nwords--in three years from this, Hawkeye'll be a howling wilderness.\r\nYou'll see. And just look at that river--noblest stream that meanders\r\nover the thirsty earth!--calmest, gentlest artery that refreshes her\r\nweary bosom! Railroad goes all over it and all through it--wades right\r\nalong on stilts. Seventeen bridges in three miles and a half--forty-nine\r\nbridges from Hark-from-the-Tomb to Stone's Landing altogether--forty\r\nnine bridges, and culverts enough to culvert creation itself!\r\nHadn't skeins of thread enough to represent them all--but you get\r\nan idea--perfect trestle-work of bridges for seventy two miles: Jeff\r\nThompson and I fixed all that, you know; he's to get the contracts and\r\nI'm to put them through on the divide. Just oceans of money in those\r\nbridges. It's the only part of the railroad I'm interested in,--down\r\nalong the line--and it's all I want, too. It's enough, I should judge.\r\nNow here we are at Napoleon. Good enough country plenty good enough--all\r\nit wants is population. That's all right--that will come. And it's\r\nno bad country now for calmness and solitude, I can tell you--though\r\nthere's no money in that, of course. No money, but a man wants rest, a\r\nman wants peace--a man don't want to rip and tear around all the time.\r\nAnd here we go, now, just as straight as a string for Hallelujah--it's a\r\nbeautiful angle--handsome up grade all the way--and then away you go to\r\nCorruptionville, the gaudiest country for early carrots and cauliflowers\r\nthat ever--good missionary field, too. There ain't such another\r\nmissionary field outside the jungles of Central Africa. And\r\npatriotic?--why they named it after Congress itself. Oh, I warn you, my\r\ndear, there's a good time coming, and it'll be right along before you\r\nknow what you're about, too. That railroad's fetching it. You see what\r\nit is as far as I've got, and if I had enough bottles and soap and\r\nboot-jacks and such things to carry it along to where it joins onto the\r\nUnion Pacific, fourteen hundred miles from here, I should exhibit to\r\nyou in that little internal improvement a spectacle of inconceivable\r\nsublimity. So, don't you see? We've got the rail road to fall back\r\non; and in the meantime, what are we worrying about that $200,000\r\nappropriation for? That's all right. I'd be willing to bet anything that\r\nthe very next letter that comes from Harry will--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe eldest boy entered just in the nick of time and brought a letter,\r\nwarm from the post-office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThings do look bright, after all, Beriah. I'm sorry I was blue, but it\r\ndid seem as if everything had been going against us for whole ages. Open\r\nthe letter--open it quick, and let's know all about it before we stir\r\nout of our places. I am all in a fidget to know what it says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe letter was opened, without any unnecessary delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 4.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII Visit to Headquarters in Wall Street--How Appropriations\r\nAre Obtained and Their Cost\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX Philip's Experience With the Rail--Road Conductor--Surveys\r\nHis Mining Property\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX Laura and Col Sellers Go To Washington On Invitation of\r\nSenator Dilworthy\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI Philip and Harry at the Boltons'--Philip Seriously\r\nInjured--Ruth's First Case of Surgery\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII Laura Becomes a Famous Belle at Washington\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII Society in Washington--The Antiques, the Parvenus, and\r\nthe Middle Aristocracy\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV Grand Scheme For Disposing of the Tennessee Land--Laura\r\nand Washington Hawkins Enjoying the Reputation of Being Millionaires\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV About Senators--Their Privileges and Habits\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI An Hour in a Book Store\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n91.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AT HEADQUARTERS 92.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0TOUCHING A WEAK SPOT 93.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0CHAIRMAN OF\r\nCOMMITTEE, $10,000, 94.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MALE LOBBYIST, $3,000 255 95.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0FEMALE LOBBYIST,\r\n$3,000 96.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0HIGH MORAL SENATOR, $3,000 97.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0COUNTRY MEMBER, $500\r\n98.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0DOCUMENTARY PROOF 99.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0COLONEL SELLERS DESPONDENT 100.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0TAIL PIECE\r\n101.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0THE MONARCH OF ALL HE SURVEYS 102.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0PHILIP THRUST FROM THE R.\r\nR.

The porter returned in a minute; and asked whom he would\r\nlike to see?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe president of the company, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is busy with some gentlemen, sir; says he will be done with them\r\ndirectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat a copper-plate card with \xe2\x80\x9cEngineer-in-Chief\xe2\x80\x9d on it should be\r\nreceived with such tranquility as this, annoyed Mr. Brierly not a\r\nlittle. But he had to submit. Indeed his annoyance had time to augment a\r\ngood deal; for he was allowed to cool his heels a full half hour in the\r\nante-room before those gentlemen emerged and he was ushered into the\r\npresence. He found a stately dignitary occupying a very official\r\nchair behind a long green morocco-covered table, in a room sumptuously\r\ncarpeted and furnished, and well garnished with pictures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, sir; take a seat--take a seat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry, throwing as much chill into his manner as\r\nhis ruffled dignity prompted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe perceive by your reports and the reports of the Chief\r\nSuperintendent, that you have been making gratifying progress with the\r\nwork.--We are all very much pleased.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed? We did not discover it from your letters--which we have not\r\nreceived; nor by the treatment our drafts have met with--which were not\r\nhonored; nor by the reception of any part of the appropriation, no part\r\nof it having come to hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my dear Mr. Brierly, there must be some mistake, I am sure we\r\nwrote you and also Mr. Sellers, recently--when my clerk comes he will\r\nshow copies--letters informing you of the ten per cent. assessment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, certainly, we got those letters. But what we wanted was money to\r\ncarry on the work--money to pay the men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, certainly--true enough--but we credited you both for a large\r\npart of your assessments--I am sure that was in our letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course that was in--I remember that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, very well then. Now we begin to understand each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don't see that we do. There's two months' wages due the men,\r\nand----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? Haven't you paid the men?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPaid them! How are we going to pay them when you don't honor our\r\ndrafts?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my dear sir, I cannot see how you can find any fault with us. I\r\nam sure we have acted in a perfectly straight forward business way.--Now\r\nlet us look at the thing a moment. You subscribed for 100 shares of the\r\ncapital stock, at $1,000 a share, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. Sellers took a like amount?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. No concern can get along without money. We levied a ten per\r\ncent. assessment. It was the original understanding that you and Mr.\r\nSellers were to have the positions you now hold, with salaries of $600\r\na month each, while in active service. You were duly elected to these\r\nplaces, and you accepted them. Am I right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. You were given your instructions and put to work. By your\r\nreports it appears that you have expended the sum of $9,610 upon the\r\nsaid work. Two months salary to you two officers amounts altogether\r\nto $2,400--about one-eighth of your ten per cent. assessment, you see;\r\nwhich leaves you in debt to the company for the other seven-eighths\r\nof the assessment--viz, something over $8,000 apiece. Now instead of\r\nrequiring you to forward this aggregate of $16,000 or $17,000 to New\r\nYork, the company voted unanimously to let you pay it over to the\r\ncontractors, laborers from time to time, and give you credit on the\r\nbooks for it. And they did it without a murmur, too, for they were\r\npleased with the progress you had made, and were glad to pay you that\r\nlittle compliment--and a very neat one it was, too, I am sure. The\r\nwork you did fell short of $10,000, a trifle. Let me see--$9,640 from\r\n$20,000--salary $2,400 added--ah yes, the balance due the company from\r\nyourself and Mr. Sellers is $7,960, which I will take the responsibility\r\nof allowing to stand for the present, unless you prefer to draw a check\r\nnow, and thus----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound it, do you mean to say that instead of the company owing us\r\n$2,400, we owe the company $7,960?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that we owe the men and the contractors nearly ten thousand dollars\r\nbesides?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOwe them! Oh bless my soul, you can't mean that you have not paid these\r\npeople?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do mean it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe president rose and walked the floor like a man in bodily pain. His\r\nbrows contracted, he put his hand up and clasped his forehead, and kept\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is, too bad, too bad, too bad! Oh, it is bound to be\r\nfound out--nothing can prevent it--nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he threw himself into his chair and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Mr. Brierson, this is dreadful--perfectly dreadful. It will\r\nbe found out. It is bound to tarnish the good name of the company; our\r\ncredit will be seriously, most seriously impaired. How could you be so\r\nthoughtless--the men ought to have been paid though it beggared us all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey ought, ought they? Then why the devil--my name is not Bryerson, by\r\nthe way--why the mischief didn't the compa--why what in the nation\r\never became of the appropriation? Where is that appropriation?--if a\r\nstockholder may make so bold as to ask.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe appropriation?--that paltry $200,000, do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course--but I didn't know that $200,000 was so very paltry. Though\r\nI grant, of course, that it is not a large sum, strictly speaking. But\r\nwhere is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sir, you surprise me. You surely cannot have had a large\r\nacquaintance with this sort of thing. Otherwise you would not have\r\nexpected much of a result from a mere INITIAL appropriation like that.\r\nIt was never intended for anything but a mere nest egg for the future\r\nand real appropriations to cluster around.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed? Well, was it a myth, or was it a reality? Whatever become of\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy the--matter is simple enough. A Congressional appropriation costs\r\nmoney. Just reflect, for instance--a majority of the House Committee,\r\nsay $10,000 apiece--$40,000; a majority of the Senate Committee, the\r\nsame each--say $40,000; a little extra to one or two chairman of one or\r\ntwo such committees, say $10,000 each--$20,000; and there's $100,000\r\nof the money gone, to begin with. Then, seven male lobbyists, at $3,000\r\neach--$21,000; one female lobbyist, $10,000; a high moral Congressman\r\nor Senator here and there--the high moral ones cost more, because they.\r\ngive tone to a measure--say ten of these at $3,000 each, is $30,000;\r\nthen a lot of small-fry country members who won't vote for anything\r\nwhatever without pay--say twenty at $500 apiece, is $10,000; a lot\r\nof dinners to members--say $10,000 altogether; lot of jimcracks for\r\nCongressmen's wives and children--those go a long way--you can't spend\r\ntoo much money in that line--well, those things cost in a lump,\r\nsay $10,000--along there somewhere; and then comes your printed\r\ndocuments--your maps, your tinted engravings, your pamphlets, your\r\nilluminated show cards, your advertisements in a hundred and fifty\r\npapers at ever so much a line--because you've got to keep the papers all\r\nright or you are gone up, you know. Oh, my dear sir, printing bills\r\nare destruction itself. Ours so far amount to--let me see--10; 52; 22;\r\n13;--and then there's 11; 14; 33--well, never mind the details, the\r\ntotal in clean numbers foots up $118,254.42 thus far!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes indeed. Printing's no bagatelle, I can tell you. And then\r\nthere's your contributions, as a company, to Chicago fires and Boston\r\nfires, and orphan asylums and all that sort of thing--head the list,\r\nyou see, with the company's full name and a thousand dollars set\r\nopposite--great card, sir--one of the finest advertisements in the\r\nworld--the preachers mention it in the pulpit when it's a religious\r\ncharity--one of the happiest advertisements in the world is your\r\nbenevolent donation. Ours have amounted to sixteen thousand dollars and\r\nsome cents up to this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes. Perhaps the biggest thing we've done in the advertising line\r\nwas to get an officer of the U. S. government, of perfectly Himmalayan\r\nofficial altitude, to write up our little internal improvement for a\r\nreligious paper of enormous circulation--I tell you that makes our bonds\r\ngo handsomely among the pious poor. Your religious paper is by far\r\nthe best vehicle for a thing of this kind, because they'll 'lead' your\r\narticle and put it right in the midst of the reading matter; and if it's\r\ngot a few Scripture quotations in it, and some temperance platitudes\r\nand a bit of gush here and there about Sunday Schools, and a sentimental\r\nsnuffle now and then about 'God's precious ones, the honest hard-handed\r\npoor,' it works the nation like a charm, my dear sir, and never a man\r\nsuspects that it is an advertisement; but your secular paper sticks you\r\nright into the advertising columns and of course you don't take a trick.\r\nGive me a religious paper to advertise in, every time; and if you'll\r\njust look at their advertising pages, you'll observe that other people\r\nthink a good deal as I do--especially people who have got little\r\nfinancial schemes to make everybody rich with. Of course I mean your\r\ngreat big metropolitan religious papers that know how to serve God and\r\nmake money at the same time--that's your sort, sir, that's your sort--a\r\nreligious paper that isn't run to make money is no use to us, sir, as an\r\nadvertising medium--no use to anybody--in our line of business. I guess\r\nour next best dodge was sending a pleasure trip of newspaper reporters\r\nout to Napoleon. Never paid them a cent; just filled them up with\r\nchampagne and the fat of the land, put pen, ink and paper before them\r\nwhile they were red-hot, and bless your soul when you come to read their\r\nletters you'd have supposed they'd been to heaven. And if a sentimental\r\nsqueamishness held one or two of them back from taking a less rosy view\r\nof Napoleon, our hospitalities tied his tongue, at least, and he said\r\nnothing at all and so did us no harm. Let me see--have I stated all\r\nthe expenses I've been at? No, I was near forgetting one or two items.\r\nThere's your official salaries--you can't get good men for nothing.\r\nSalaries cost pretty lively. And then there's your big\r\nhigh-sounding millionaire names stuck into your advertisements as\r\nstockholders--another card, that--and they are stockholders, too, but\r\nyou have to give them the stock and non-assessable at that--so they're\r\nan expensive lot. Very, very expensive thing, take it all around, is\r\na big internal improvement concern--but you see that yourself, Mr.\r\nBryerman--you see that, yourself, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut look here. I think you are a little mistaken about it's ever having\r\ncost anything for Congressional votes. I happen to know something about\r\nthat. I've let you say your say--now let me say mine. I don't wish to\r\nseem to throw any suspicion on anybody's statements, because we are all\r\nliable to be mistaken. But how would it strike you if I were to say that\r\nI was in Washington all the time this bill was pending? and what if I\r\nadded that I put the measure through myself? Yes, sir, I did that little\r\nthing. And moreover, I never paid a dollar for any man's vote and never\r\npromised one. There are some ways of doing a thing that are as good as\r\nothers which other people don't happen to think about, or don't have the\r\nknack of succeeding in, if they do happen to think of them. My dear sir,\r\nI am obliged to knock some of your expenses in the head--for never a\r\ncent was paid a Congressman or Senator on the part of this Navigation\r\nCompany.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe president smiled blandly, even sweetly, all through this harangue,\r\nand then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery word of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell it does seem to alter the complexion of things a little. You are\r\nacquainted with the members down there, of course, else you could not\r\nhave worked to such advantage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know them all, sir. I know their wives, their children, their\r\nbabies--I even made it a point to be on good terms with their lackeys. I\r\nknow every Congressman well--even familiarly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. Do you know any of their signatures? Do you know their\r\nhandwriting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy I know their handwriting as well as I know my own--have\r\nhad correspondence enough with them, I should think. And their\r\nsignatures--why I can tell their initials, even.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe president went to a private safe, unlocked it and got out some\r\nletters and certain slips of paper. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow here, for instance; do you believe that that is a genuine letter?\r\nDo you know this signature here?--and this one? Do you know who those\r\ninitials represent--and are they forgeries?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry was stupefied. There were things there that made his brain swim.\r\nPresently, at the bottom of one of the letters he saw a signature that\r\nrestored his equilibrium; it even brought the sunshine of a smile to his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThe president said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat one amuses you. You never suspected him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I ought to have suspected him, but I don't believe it ever\r\nreally occurred to me. Well, well, well--how did you ever have the nerve\r\nto approach him, of all others?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy my friend, we never think of accomplishing anything without his\r\nhelp. He is our mainstay. But how do those letters strike you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey strike me dumb! What a stone-blind idiot I have been!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, take it all around, I suppose you had a pleasant time in\r\nWashington,\xe2\x80\x9d said the president, gathering up the letters; \xe2\x80\x9cof course\r\nyou must have had. Very few men could go there and get a money bill\r\nthrough without buying a single--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, now, Mr. President, that's plenty of that! I take back everything\r\nI said on that head. I'm a wiser man to-day than I was yesterday, I can\r\ntell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you are. In fact I am satisfied you are. But now I showed you\r\nthese things in confidence, you understand. Mention facts as much as\r\nyou want to, but don't mention names to anybody. I can depend on you for\r\nthat, can't I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, of course. I understand the necessity of that. I will not betray\r\nthe names. But to go back a bit, it begins to look as if you never saw\r\nany of that appropriation at all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe saw nearly ten thousand dollars of it--and that was all. Several\r\nof us took turns at log-rolling in Washington, and if we had charged\r\nanything for that service, none of that $10,000 would ever have reached\r\nNew York.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you hadn't levied the assessment you would have been in a close\r\nplace I judge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClose? Have you figured up the total of the disbursements I told you\r\nof?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I didn't think of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, lets see:\r\n\r\nSpent in Washington, say, $191,000 Printing, advertising, etc, say\r\n$118,000 Charity, say, $16,000\r\n\r\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Total, $325,000\r\n\r\nThe money to do that with, comes from-- Appropriation, $200,000\r\n\r\nTen per cent assessment on capital of $1,000,000 $100,000\r\n\r\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Total, $300,000\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich leaves us in debt some $25,000 at this moment. Salaries of home\r\nofficers are still going on; also printing and advertising. Next month\r\nwill show a state of things!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then--burst up, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means. Levy another assessment\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see. That's dismal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy isn't it? What's the road out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother appropriation, don't you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBother the appropriations. They cost more than they come to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the next one. We'll call for half a million--get it and go for a\r\nmillion the very next month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but the cost of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe president smiled, and patted his secret letters affectionately. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll these people are in the next Congress. We shan't have to pay them\r\na cent. And what is more, they will work like beavers for us--perhaps it\r\nmight be to their advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry reflected profoundly a while. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe send many missionaries to lift up the benighted races of other\r\nlands. How much cheaper and better it would be if those people could\r\nonly come here and drink of our civilization at its fountain head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI perfectly agree with you, Mr. Beverly. Must you go? Well, good\r\nmorning. Look in, when you are passing; and whenever I can give you any\r\ninformation about our affairs and prospects, I shall be glad to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry's letter was not a long one, but it contained at least the\r\ncalamitous figures that came out in the above conversation. The\r\nColonel found himself in a rather uncomfortable place--no $1,200 salary\r\nforthcoming; and himself held responsible for half of the $9,640 due the\r\nworkmen, to say nothing of being in debt to the company to the extent of\r\nnearly $4,000. Polly's heart was nearly broken; the \xe2\x80\x9cblues\xe2\x80\x9d returned in\r\nfearful force, and she had to go out of the room to hide the tears that\r\nnothing could keep back now.\r\n\r\nThere was mourning in another quarter, too, for Louise had a letter.\r\nWashington had refused, at the last moment, to take $40,000 for the\r\nTennessee Land, and had demanded $150,000! So the trade fell through,\r\nand now Washington was wailing because he had been so foolish. But he\r\nwrote that his man might probably return to the city soon, and then he\r\nmeant to sell to him, sure, even if he had to take $10,000. Louise had a\r\ngood cry--several of them, indeed--and the family charitably forebore to\r\nmake any comments that would increase her grief.\r\n\r\nSpring blossomed, summer came, dragged its hot weeks by, and the\r\nColonel's spirits rose, day by day, for the railroad was making good\r\nprogress. But by and by something happened. Hawkeye had always declined\r\nto subscribe anything toward the railway, imagining that her large\r\nbusiness would be a sufficient compulsory influence; but now Hawkeye was\r\nfrightened; and before Col. Sellers knew what he was about, Hawkeye,\r\nin a panic, had rushed to the front and subscribed such a sum that\r\nNapoleon's attractions suddenly sank into insignificance and the\r\nrailroad concluded to follow a comparatively straight coarse instead of\r\ngoing miles out of its way to build up a metropolis in the muddy desert\r\nof Stone's Landing.\r\n\r\nThe thunderbolt fell. After all the Colonel's deep planning; after all\r\nhis brain work and tongue work in drawing public attention to his pet\r\nproject and enlisting interest in it; after all his faithful hard toil\r\nwith his hands, and running hither and thither on his busy feet; after\r\nall his high hopes and splendid prophecies, the fates had turned their\r\nbacks on him at last, and all in a moment his air-castles crumbled to\r\nruins about him. Hawkeye rose from her fright triumphant and rejoicing,\r\nand down went Stone's Landing! One by one its meagre parcel of\r\ninhabitants packed up and moved away, as the summer waned and fall\r\napproached. Town lots were no longer salable, traffic ceased, a deadly\r\nlethargy fell upon the place once more, the \xe2\x80\x9cWeekly Telegraph\xe2\x80\x9d faded\r\ninto an early grave, the wary tadpole returned from exile, the bullfrog\r\nresumed his ancient song, the tranquil turtle sunned his back upon bank\r\nand log and drowsed his grateful life away as in the old sweet days of\r\nyore.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nPhilip Sterling was on his way to Ilium, in the state of Pennsylvania.\r\nIlium was the railway station nearest to the tract of wild land which\r\nMr. Bolton had commissioned him to examine.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the journey as the railway train Philip was on was\r\nleaving a large city, a lady timidly entered the drawing-room car, and\r\nhesitatingly took a chair that was at the moment unoccupied. Philip saw\r\nfrom the window that a gentleman had put her upon the car just as it was\r\nstarting. In a few moments the conductor entered, and without waiting an\r\nexplanation, said roughly to the lady,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you can't sit there. That seat's taken. Go into the other car.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not intend to take the seat,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady rising, \xe2\x80\x9cI only sat\r\ndown a moment till the conductor should come and give me a seat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere aint any. Car's full. You'll have to leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady, appealingly, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan't help what you thought--you must go into the other car.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe train is going very fast, let me stand here till we stop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe lady can have my seat,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Philip, springing up.\r\n\r\nThe conductor turned towards Philip, and coolly and deliberately\r\nsurveyed him from head to foot, with contempt in every line of his face,\r\nturned his back upon him without a word, and said to the lady,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, I've got no time to talk. You must go now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady, entirely disconcerted by such rudeness, and frightened, moved\r\ntowards the door, opened it and stepped out. The train was swinging\r\nalong at a rapid rate, jarring from side to side; the step was a long\r\none between the cars and there was no protecting grating. The lady\r\nattempted it, but lost her balance, in the wind and the motion of the\r\ncar, and fell! She would inevitably have gone down under the wheels, if\r\nPhilip, who had swiftly followed her, had not caught her arm and drawn\r\nher up. He then assisted her across, found her a seat, received her\r\nbewildered thanks, and returned to his car.\r\n\r\nThe conductor was still there, taking his tickets, and growling\r\nsomething about imposition. Philip marched up to him, and burst out\r\nwith,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a brute, an infernal brute, to treat a woman that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you'd like to make a fuss about it,\xe2\x80\x9d sneered the conductor.\r\n\r\nPhilip's reply was a blow, given so suddenly and planted so squarely in\r\nthe conductor's face, that it sent him reeling over a fat passenger, who\r\nwas looking up in mild wonder that any one should dare to dispute with a\r\nconductor, and against the side of the car.\r\n\r\nHe recovered himself, reached the bell rope, \xe2\x80\x9cDamn you, I'll learn you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n stepped to the door and called a couple of brakemen, and then, as the\r\nspeed slackened; roared out,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet off this train.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not get off. I have as much right here as you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe'll see,\xe2\x80\x9d said the conductor, advancing with the brakemen. The\r\npassengers protested, and some of them said to each other, \xe2\x80\x9cThat's too\r\nbad,\xe2\x80\x9d as they always do in such cases, but none of them offered to take\r\na hand with Philip. The men seized him, wrenched him from his seat,\r\ndragged him along the aisle, tearing his clothes, thrust him from the\r\ncar, and, then flung his carpet-bag, overcoat and umbrella after him.\r\nAnd the train went on.\r\n\r\nThe conductor, red in the face and puffing from his exertion, swaggered\r\nthrough the car, muttering \xe2\x80\x9cPuppy, I'll learn him.\xe2\x80\x9d The passengers, when\r\nhe had gone, were loud in their indignation, and talked about signing a\r\nprotest, but they did nothing more than talk.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the Hooverville Patriot and Clarion had this \xe2\x80\x9citem\xe2\x80\x9d:--\r\n\r\nSLIGHTUALLY OVERBOARD.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe learn that as the down noon express was leaving H---- yesterday a\r\nlady! (God save the mark) attempted to force herself into the already\r\nfull palatial car. Conductor Slum, who is too old a bird to be caught\r\nwith chaff, courteously informed her that the car was full, and when\r\nshe insisted on remaining, he persuaded her to go into the car where\r\nshe belonged. Thereupon a young sprig, from the East, blustered like a\r\nShanghai rooster, and began to sass the conductor with his chin music.\r\nThat gentleman delivered the young aspirant for a muss one of his\r\nelegant little left-handers, which so astonished him that he began\r\nto feel for his shooter. Whereupon Mr. Slum gently raised the youth,\r\ncarried him forth, and set him down just outside the car to cool off.\r\nWhether the young blood has yet made his way out of Bascom's swamp,\r\nwe have not learned. Conductor Slum is one of the most gentlemanly and\r\nefficient officers on the road; but he ain't trifled with, not much. We\r\nlearn that the company have put a new engine on the seven o'clock train,\r\nand newly upholstered the drawing-room car throughout. It spares no\r\neffort for the comfort of the traveling public.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip never had been before in Bascom's swamp, and there was nothing\r\ninviting in it to detain him. After the train got out of the way he\r\ncrawled out of the briars and the mud, and got upon the track. He was\r\nsomewhat bruised, but he was too angry to mind that. He plodded along\r\nover the ties in a very hot condition of mind and body. In the scuffle,\r\nhis railway check had disappeared, and he grimly wondered, as he noticed\r\nthe loss, if the company would permit him to walk over their track if\r\nthey should know he hadn't a ticket.\r\n\r\nPhilip had to walk some five miles before he reached a little station,\r\nwhere he could wait for a train, and he had ample time for reflection.\r\nAt first he was full of vengeance on the company. He would sue it. He\r\nwould make it pay roundly. But then it occurred to him that he did not\r\nknow the name of a witness he could summon, and that a personal fight\r\nagainst a railway corporation was about the most hopeless in the world.\r\nHe then thought he would seek out that conductor, lie in wait for him at\r\nsome station, and thrash him, or get thrashed himself.\r\n\r\nBut as he got cooler, that did not seem to him a project worthy of a\r\ngentleman exactly. Was it possible for a gentleman to get even with such\r\na fellow as that conductor on the letter's own plane? And when he came\r\nto this point, he began to ask himself, if he had not acted very much\r\nlike a fool. He didn't regret striking the fellow--he hoped he had\r\nleft a mark on him. But, after all, was that the best way? Here was he,\r\nPhilip Sterling, calling himself a gentleman, in a brawl with a vulgar\r\nconductor, about a woman he had never seen before. Why should he have\r\nput himself in such a ridiculous position? Wasn't it enough to have\r\noffered the lady his seat, to have rescued her from an accident, perhaps\r\nfrom death? Suppose he had simply said to the conductor, \xe2\x80\x9cSir, your\r\nconduct is brutal, I shall report you.\xe2\x80\x9d The passengers, who saw the\r\naffair, might have joined in a report against the conductor, and he\r\nmight really have accomplished something. And, now! Philip looked at his\r\ntorn clothes, and thought with disgust of his haste in getting into a\r\nfight with such an autocrat.\r\n\r\nAt the little station where Philip waited for the next train, he met a\r\nman--who turned out to be a justice of the peace in that neighborhood,\r\nand told him his adventure. He was a kindly sort of man, and seemed very\r\nmuch interested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDum 'em,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, when he had heard the story.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think any thing can be done, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWal, I guess tain't no use. I hain't a mite of doubt of every word you\r\nsay. But suin's no use. The railroad company owns all these people along\r\nhere, and the judges on the bench too. Spiled your clothes! Wal, 'least\r\nsaid's soonest mended.' You haint no chance with the company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen next morning, he read the humorous account in the Patriot and\r\nClarion, he saw still more clearly what chance he would have had before\r\nthe public in a fight with the railroad company.\r\n\r\nStill Philip's conscience told him that it was his plain duty to carry\r\nthe matter into the courts, even with the certainty of defeat. He\r\nconfessed that neither he nor any citizen had a right to consult his\r\nown feelings or conscience in a case where a law of the land had been\r\nviolated before his own eyes. He confessed that every citizen's first\r\nduty in such case is to put aside his own business and devote his time\r\nand his best efforts to seeing that the infraction is promptly punished;\r\nand he knew that no country can be well governed unless its citizens as\r\na body keep religiously before their minds that they are the guardians\r\nof the law, and that the law officers are only the machinery for its\r\nexecution, nothing more. As a finality he was obliged to confess that he\r\nwas a bad citizen, and also that the general laxity of the time, and\r\nthe absence of a sense of duty toward any part of the community but the\r\nindividual himself were ingrained in him, and he was no better than the\r\nrest of the people.\r\n\r\nThe result of this little adventure was that Philip did not reach Ilium\r\ntill daylight the next morning, when he descended sleepy and sore, from\r\na way train, and looked about him. Ilium was in a narrow mountain gorge,\r\nthrough which a rapid stream ran. It consisted of the plank platform\r\non which he stood, a wooden house, half painted, with a dirty piazza\r\n(unroofed) in front, and a sign board hung on a slanting pole--bearing\r\nthe legend, \xe2\x80\x9cHotel. P. Dusenheimer,\xe2\x80\x9d a sawmill further down the stream,\r\na blacksmith-shop, and a store, and three or four unpainted dwellings of\r\nthe slab variety.\r\n\r\nAs Philip approached the hotel he saw what appeared to be a wild beast\r\ncrouching on the piazza. It did not stir, however, and he soon found\r\nthat it was only a stuffed skin. This cheerful invitation to the tavern\r\nwas the remains of a huge panther which had been killed in the region\r\na few weeks before. Philip examined his ugly visage and strong crooked\r\nfore-arm, as he was waiting admittance, having pounded upon the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYait a bit. I'll shoost--put on my trowsers,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted a voice from the\r\nwindow, and the door was soon opened by the yawning landlord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorgen! Didn't hear d' drain oncet. Dem boys geeps me up zo spate. Gom\r\nright in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was shown into a dirty bar-room. It was a small room, with a\r\nstove in the middle, set in a long shallow box of sand, for the benefit\r\nof the \xe2\x80\x9cspitters,\xe2\x80\x9d a bar across one end--a mere counter with a sliding\r\nglass-case behind it containing a few bottles having ambitious labels,\r\nand a wash-sink in one corner. On the walls were the bright yellow and\r\nblack handbills of a traveling circus, with pictures of acrobats\r\nin human pyramids, horses flying in long leaps through the air, and\r\nsylph-like women in a paradisaic costume, balancing themselves upon the\r\ntips of their toes on the bare backs of frantic and plunging steeds, and\r\nkissing their hands to the spectators meanwhile.\r\n\r\nAs Philip did not desire a room at that hour, he was invited to wash\r\nhimself at the nasty sink, a feat somewhat easier than drying his face,\r\nfor the towel that hung in a roller over the sink was evidently as much\r\na fixture as the sink itself, and belonged, like the suspended brush and\r\ncomb, to the traveling public. Philip managed to complete his toilet by\r\nthe use of his pocket-handkerchief, and declining the hospitality of the\r\nlandlord, implied in the remark, \xe2\x80\x9cYou won'd dake notin'?\xe2\x80\x9d he went into\r\nthe open air to wait for breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe country he saw was wild but not picturesque. The mountain before\r\nhim might be eight hundred feet high, and was only a portion of a long\r\nunbroken range, savagely wooded, which followed the stream. Behind the\r\nhotel, and across the brawling brook, was another level-topped, wooded\r\nrange exactly like it. Ilium itself, seen at a glance, was old enough to\r\nbe dilapidated, and if it had gained anything by being made a wood and\r\nwater station of the new railroad, it was only a new sort of grime\r\nand rawness. P. Dusenheimer, standing in the door of his uninviting\r\ngroggery, when the trains stopped for water; never received from\r\nthe traveling public any patronage except facetious remarks upon his\r\npersonal appearance. Perhaps a thousand times he had heard the remark,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIlium fuit,\xe2\x80\x9d followed in most instances by a hail to himself as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAEneas,\xe2\x80\x9d with the inquiry \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is old Anchises?\xe2\x80\x9d At first he had\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cDere ain't no such man;\xe2\x80\x9d but irritated by its senseless\r\nrepetition, he had latterly dropped into the formula of, \xe2\x80\x9cYou be dam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was recalled from the contemplation of Ilium by the rolling and\r\ngrowling of the gong within the hotel, the din and clamor increasing\r\ntill the house was apparently unable to contain it; when it burst out of\r\nthe front door and informed the world that breakfast was on the table.\r\n\r\nThe dining room was long, low and narrow, and a narrow table extended\r\nits whole length. Upon this was spread a cloth which from appearance\r\nmight have been as long in use as the towel in the barroom. Upon the\r\ntable was the usual service, the heavy, much nicked stone ware, the row\r\nof plated and rusty castors, the sugar bowls with the zinc\r\ntea-spoons sticking up in them, the piles of yellow biscuits, the\r\ndiscouraged-looking plates of butter. The landlord waited, and Philip\r\nwas pleased to observe the change in his manner. In the barroom he was\r\nthe conciliatory landlord. Standing behind his guests at table, he had\r\nan air of peremptory patronage, and the voice in which he shot out the\r\ninquiry, as he seized Philip's plate, \xe2\x80\x9cBeefsteak or liver?\xe2\x80\x9d quite took\r\naway Philip's power of choice. He begged for a glass of milk, after\r\ntrying that green hued compound called coffee, and made his breakfast\r\nout of that and some hard crackers which seemed to have been imported\r\ninto Ilium before the introduction of the iron horse, and to have\r\nwithstood a ten years siege of regular boarders, Greeks and others.\r\n\r\nThe land that Philip had come to look at was at least five miles distant\r\nfrom Ilium station. A corner of it touched the railroad, but the rest\r\nwas pretty much an unbroken wilderness, eight or ten thousand acres of\r\nrough country, most of it such a mountain range as he saw at Ilium.\r\n\r\nHis first step was to hire three woodsmen to accompany him. By their\r\nhelp he built a log hut, and established a camp on the land, and then\r\nbegan his explorations, mapping down his survey as he went along, noting\r\nthe timber, and the lay of the land, and making superficial observations\r\nas to the prospect of coal.\r\n\r\nThe landlord at Ilium endeavored to persuade Philip to hire the services\r\nof a witch-hazel professor of that region, who could walk over the land\r\nwith his wand and tell him infallibly whether it contained coal, and\r\nexactly where the strata ran. But Philip preferred to trust to his own\r\nstudy of the country, and his knowledge of the geological formation. He\r\nspent a month in traveling over the land and making calculations; and\r\nmade up his mind that a fine vein of coal ran through the mountain about\r\na mile from the railroad, and that the place to run in a tunnel was half\r\nway towards its summit.\r\n\r\nActing with his usual promptness, Philip, with the consent of Mr.\r\nBolton, broke ground there at once, and, before snow came, had some rude\r\nbuildings up, and was ready for active operations in the spring. It\r\nwas true that there were no outcroppings of coal at the place, and the\r\npeople at Ilium said he \xe2\x80\x9cmought as well dig for plug terbaccer there;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n but Philip had great faith in the uniformity of nature's operations in\r\nages past, and he had no doubt that he should strike at this spot the\r\nrich vein that had made the fortune of the Golden Briar Company.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nOnce more Louise had good news from her Washington--Senator Dilworthy\r\nwas going to sell the Tennessee Land to the government! Louise told\r\nLaura in confidence. She had told her parents, too, and also several\r\nbosom friends; but all of these people had simply looked sad when they\r\nheard the news, except Laura. Laura's face suddenly brightened under\r\nit--only for an instant, it is true, but poor Louise was grateful for\r\neven that fleeting ray of encouragement. When next Laura was alone, she\r\nfell into a train of thought something like this:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the Senator has really taken hold of this matter, I may look for\r\nthat invitation to his house at any moment. I am perishing to go! I do\r\nlong to know whether I am only simply a large-sized pigmy among these\r\npigmies here, who tumble over so easily when one strikes them, or\r\nwhether I am really--.\xe2\x80\x9d Her thoughts drifted into other channels, for\r\na season. Then she continued:--\xe2\x80\x9cHe said I could be useful in the great\r\ncause of philanthropy, and help in the blessed work of uplifting the\r\npoor and the ignorant, if he found it feasible to take hold of our\r\nLand. Well, that is neither here nor there; what I want, is to go to\r\nWashington and find out what I am. I want money, too; and if one\r\nmay judge by what she hears, there are chances there for a--.\xe2\x80\x9d For a\r\nfascinating woman, she was going to say, perhaps, but she did not.\r\n\r\nAlong in the fall the invitation came, sure enough. It came officially\r\nthrough brother Washington, the private Secretary, who appended a\r\npostscript that was brimming with delight over the prospect of seeing\r\nthe Duchess again. He said it would be happiness enough to look upon\r\nher face once more--it would be almost too much happiness when to it was\r\nadded the fact that she would bring messages with her that were fresh\r\nfrom Louise's lips.\r\n\r\nIn Washington's letter were several important enclosures. For instance,\r\nthere was the Senator's check for $2,000--\xe2\x80\x9cto buy suitable clothing in\r\nNew York with!\xe2\x80\x9d It was a loan to be refunded when the Land was sold.\r\nTwo thousand--this was fine indeed. Louise's father was called rich, but\r\nLaura doubted if Louise had ever had $400 worth of new clothing at one\r\ntime in her life. With the check came two through tickets--good on\r\nthe railroad from Hawkeye to Washington via New York--and they were\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdead-head\xe2\x80\x9d tickets, too, which had been given to Senator Dilworthy by\r\nthe railway companies. Senators and representatives were paid thousands\r\nof dollars by the government for traveling expenses, but they\r\nalways traveled \xe2\x80\x9cdeadhead\xe2\x80\x9d both ways, and then did as any honorable,\r\nhigh-minded men would naturally do--declined to receive the mileage\r\ntendered them by the government. The Senator had plenty of railway\r\npasses, and could easily spare two to Laura--one for herself and one for\r\na male escort. Washington suggested that she get some old friend of the\r\nfamily to come with her, and said the Senator would \xe2\x80\x9cdeadhead\xe2\x80\x9d him home\r\nagain as soon as he had grown tired of the sights of the capital. Laura\r\nthought the thing over. At first she was pleased with the idea, but\r\npresently she began to feel differently about it. Finally she said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nour staid, steady-going Hawkeye friends' notions and mine differ about\r\nsome things--they respect me, now, and I respect them--better leave\r\nit so--I will go alone; I am not afraid to travel by myself.\xe2\x80\x9d And so\r\ncommuning with herself, she left the house for an afternoon walk.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the door she met Col. Sellers. She told him about her\r\ninvitation to Washington.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless me!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel. \xe2\x80\x9cI have about made up my mind to go there\r\nmyself. You see we've got to get another appropriation through, and the\r\nCompany want me to come east and put it through Congress. Harry's there,\r\nand he'll do what he can, of course; and Harry's a good fellow and\r\nalways does the very best he knows how, but then he's young--rather\r\nyoung for some parts of such work, you know--and besides he talks too\r\nmuch, talks a good deal too much; and sometimes he appears to be a\r\nlittle bit visionary, too, I think the worst thing in the world for a\r\nbusiness man. A man like that always exposes his cards, sooner or later.\r\nThis sort of thing wants an old, quiet, steady hand--wants an old cool\r\nhead, you know, that knows men, through and through, and is used to\r\nlarge operations. I'm expecting my salary, and also some dividends\r\nfrom the company, and if they get along in time, I'll go along with you\r\nLaura--take you under my wing--you mustn't travel alone. Lord I wish I\r\nhad the money right now. --But there'll be plenty soon--plenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura reasoned with herself that if the kindly, simple-hearted Colonel\r\nwas going anyhow, what could she gain by traveling alone and throwing\r\naway his company? So she told him she accepted his offer gladly,\r\ngratefully. She said it would be the greatest of favors if he would go\r\nwith her and protect her--not at his own expense as far as railway fares\r\nwere concerned, of course; she could not expect him to put himself to so\r\nmuch trouble for her and pay his fare besides. But he wouldn't hear of\r\nher paying his fare--it would be only a pleasure to him to serve her.\r\nLaura insisted on furnishing the tickets; and finally, when argument\r\nfailed, she said the tickets cost neither her nor any one else a\r\ncent--she had two of them--she needed but one--and if he would not take\r\nthe other she would not go with him. That settled the matter. He took\r\nthe ticket. Laura was glad that she had the check for new clothing,\r\nfor she felt very certain of being able to get the Colonel to borrow a\r\nlittle of the money to pay hotel bills with, here and there.\r\n\r\nShe wrote Washington to look for her and Col. Sellers toward the end of\r\nNovember; and at about the time set the two travelers arrived safe in\r\nthe capital of the nation, sure enough.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n     She, the gracious lady, yet no paines did spare\r\n     To doe him ease, or doe him remedy:\r\n     Many restoratives of vertues rare\r\n     And costly cordialles she did apply,\r\n     To mitigate his stubborne malady.\r\n\r\n     Spenser's Faerie Queens.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Brierly was exceedingly busy in New York, so he wrote Col.\r\nSellers, but he would drop everything and go to Washington.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel believed that Harry was the prince of lobbyists, a little\r\ntoo sanguine, may be, and given to speculation, but, then, he knew\r\neverybody; the Columbus River navigation scheme was got through almost\r\nentirely by his aid. He was needed now to help through another scheme,\r\na benevolent scheme in which Col. Sellers, through the Hawkinses, had a\r\ndeep interest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't care, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote to Harry, \xe2\x80\x9cso much about the\r\nniggroes. But if the government will buy this land, it will set up the\r\nHawkins family--make Laura an heiress--and I shouldn't wonder if\r\nBeriah Sellers would set up his carriage again. Dilworthy looks at it\r\ndifferent, of course. He's all for philanthropy, for benefiting the\r\ncolored race. There's old Balsam, was in the Interior--used to be the\r\nRev. Orson Balsam of Iowa--he's made the riffle on the Injun; great\r\nInjun pacificator and land dealer. Balaam'a got the Injun to himself,\r\nand I suppose that Senator Dilworthy feels that there is nothing left\r\nhim but the colored man. I do reckon he is the best friend the colored\r\nman has got in Washington.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough Harry was in a hurry to reach Washington, he stopped in\r\nPhiladelphia; and prolonged his visit day after day, greatly to the\r\ndetriment of his business both in New York and Washington. The society\r\nat the Bolton's might have been a valid excuse for neglecting business\r\nmuch more important than his. Philip was there; he was a partner with\r\nMr. Bolton now in the new coal venture, concerning which there was much\r\nto be arranged in preparation for the Spring work, and Philip lingered\r\nweek after week in the hospitable house. Alice was making a winter\r\nvisit. Ruth only went to town twice a week to attend lectures, and the\r\nhousehold was quite to Mr. Bolton's taste, for he liked the cheer of\r\ncompany and something going on evenings. Harry was cordially asked to\r\nbring his traveling-bag there, and he did not need urging to do so. Not\r\neven the thought of seeing Laura at the capital made him restless in the\r\nsociety of the two young ladies; two birds in hand are worth one in the\r\nbush certainly.\r\n\r\nPhilip was at home--he sometimes wished he were not so much so. He felt\r\nthat too much or not enough was taken for granted. Ruth had met him,\r\nwhen he first came, with a cordial frankness, and her manner continued\r\nentirely unrestrained. She neither sought his company nor avoided it,\r\nand this perfectly level treatment irritated him more than any other\r\ncould have done. It was impossible to advance much in love-making with\r\none who offered no obstacles, had no concealments and no embarrassments,\r\nand whom any approach to sentimentality would be quite likely to set\r\ninto a fit of laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Phil,\xe2\x80\x9d she would say, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat puts you in the dumps to day? You are\r\nas solemn as the upper bench in Meeting. I shall have to call Alice to\r\nraise your spirits; my presence seems to depress you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's not your presence, but your absence when you are present,\xe2\x80\x9d began\r\nPhilip, dolefully, with the idea that he was saying a rather deep thing.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you won't understand me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I confess I cannot. If you really are so low, as to think I am\r\nabsent when I am present, it's a frightful case of aberration; I shall\r\nask father to bring out Dr. Jackson. Does Alice appear to be present\r\nwhen she is absent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlice has some human feeling, anyway. She cares for something besides\r\nmusty books and dry bones. I think, Ruth, when I die,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip,\r\nintending to be very grim and sarcastic, \xe2\x80\x9cI'll leave you my skeleton.\r\nYou might like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt might be more cheerful than you are at times,\xe2\x80\x9d Ruth replied with a\r\nlaugh. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you mustn't do it without consulting Alice. She might not\r\nlike it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know why you should bring Alice up on every occasion. Do you\r\nthink I am in love with her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless you, no. It never entered my head. Are you? The thought of Philip\r\nSterling in love is too comical. I thought you were only in love with\r\nthe Ilium coal mine, which you and father talk about half the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis is a specimen of Philip's wooing. Confound the girl, he would say\r\nto himself, why does she never tease Harry and that young Shepley who\r\ncomes here?\r\n\r\nHow differently Alice treated him. She at least never mocked him, and it\r\nwas a relief to talk with one who had some sympathy with him. And he did\r\ntalk to her, by the hour, about Ruth. The blundering fellow poured all\r\nhis doubts and anxieties into her ear, as if she had been the impassive\r\noccupant of one of those little wooden confessionals in the Cathedral on\r\nLogan Square. Has a confessor, if she is young and pretty, any feeling?\r\nDoes it mend the matter by calling her your sister?\r\n\r\nPhilip called Alice his good sister, and talked to her about love and\r\nmarriage, meaning Ruth, as if sisters could by no possibility have any\r\npersonal concern in such things. Did Ruth ever speak of him? Did she\r\nthink Ruth cared for him? Did Ruth care for anybody at Fallkill? Did she\r\ncare for anything except her profession? And so on.\r\n\r\nAlice was loyal to Ruth, and if she knew anything she did not betray her\r\nfriend. She did not, at any rate, give Philip too much encouragement.\r\nWhat woman, under the circumstances, would?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you one thing, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cif ever Ruth Bolton\r\nloves, it will be with her whole soul, in a depth of passion that will\r\nsweep everything before it and surprise even herself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA remark that did not much console Philip, who imagined that only some\r\ngrand heroism could unlock the sweetness of such a heart; and Philip\r\nfeared that he wasn't a hero. He did not know out of what materials a\r\nwoman can construct a hero, when she is in the creative mood.\r\n\r\nHarry skipped into this society with his usual lightness and gaiety.\r\nHis good nature was inexhaustible, and though he liked to relate his own\r\nexploits, he had a little tact in adapting himself to the tastes of his\r\nhearers. He was not long in finding out that Alice liked to hear about\r\nPhilip, and Harry launched out into the career of his friend in the\r\nWest, with a prodigality of invention that would have astonished\r\nthe chief actor. He was the most generous fellow in the world, and\r\npicturesque conversation was the one thing in which he never was\r\nbankrupt. With Mr. Bolton he was the serious man of business, enjoying\r\nthe confidence of many of the monied men in New York, whom Mr. Bolton\r\nknew, and engaged with them in railway schemes and government contracts.\r\nPhilip, who had so long known Harry, never could make up his mind that\r\nHarry did not himself believe that he was a chief actor in all these\r\nlarge operations of which he talked so much.\r\n\r\nHarry did not neglect to endeavor to make himself agreeable to Mrs.\r\nBolton, by paying great attention to the children, and by professing the\r\nwarmest interest in the Friends' faith. It always seemed to him the\r\nmost peaceful religion; he thought it must be much easier to live by an\r\ninternal light than by a lot of outward rules; he had a dear Quaker aunt\r\nin Providence of whom Mrs. Bolton constantly reminded him. He insisted\r\nupon going with Mrs. Bolton and the children to the Friends Meeting on\r\nFirst Day, when Ruth and Alice and Philip, \xe2\x80\x9cworld's people,\xe2\x80\x9d went to a\r\nchurch in town, and he sat through the hour of silence with his hat on,\r\nin most exemplary patience. In short, this amazing actor succeeded so\r\nwell with Mrs. Bolton, that she said to Philip one day,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy friend, Henry Brierly, appears to be a very worldly minded young\r\nman. Does he believe in anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip laughing, \xe2\x80\x9che believes in more things than any\r\nother person I ever saw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo Ruth, Harry seemed to be very congenial. He was never moody for one\r\nthing, but lent himself with alacrity to whatever her fancy was. He was\r\ngay or grave as the need might be. No one apparently could enter more\r\nfully into her plans for an independent career.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry, \xe2\x80\x9cwas bred a physician, and practiced a little\r\nbefore he went into Wall street. I always had a leaning to the study.\r\nThere was a skeleton hanging in the closet of my father's study when\r\nI was a boy, that I used to dress up in old clothes. Oh, I got quite\r\nfamiliar with the human frame.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip. \xe2\x80\x9cWas that where you learned to play the\r\nbones? He is a master of those musical instruments, Ruth; he plays well\r\nenough to go on the stage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip hates science of any kind, and steady application,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted\r\nHarry. He didn't fancy Philip's banter, and when the latter had gone\r\nout, and Ruth asked,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don't you take up medicine, Mr. Brierly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have it in mind. I believe I would begin attending\r\nlectures this winter if it weren't for being wanted in Washington. But\r\nmedicine is particularly women's province.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ruth, rather amused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the treatment of disease is a good deal a matter of sympathy. A\r\nwoman's intuition is better than a man's. Nobody knows anything, really,\r\nyou know, and a woman can guess a good deal nearer than a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very complimentary to my sex.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry frankly; \xe2\x80\x9cI should want to choose my doctor; an ugly\r\nwoman would ruin me, the disease would be sure to strike in and kill\r\nme at sight of her. I think a pretty physician, with engaging manners,\r\nwould coax a fellow to live through almost anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you are a scoffer, Mr. Brierly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, I am quite sincere. Wasn't it old what's his name that\r\nsaid only the beautiful is useful?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhether Ruth was anything more than diverted with Harry's company,\r\nPhilip could not determine. He scorned at any rate to advance his own\r\ninterest by any disparaging communications about Harry, both because he\r\ncould not help liking the fellow himself, and because he may have known\r\nthat he could not more surely create a sympathy for him in Ruth's mind.\r\nThat Ruth was in no danger of any serious impression he felt pretty\r\nsure, felt certain of it when he reflected upon her severe occupation\r\nwith her profession. Hang it, he would say to himself, she is nothing\r\nbut pure intellect anyway. And he only felt uncertain of it when she was\r\nin one of her moods of raillery, with mocking mischief in her eyes. At\r\nsuch times she seemed to prefer Harry's society to his. When Philip was\r\nmiserable about this, he always took refuge with Alice, who was never\r\nmoody, and who generally laughed him out of his sentimental nonsense. He\r\nfelt at his ease with Alice, and was never in want of something to talk\r\nabout; and he could not account for the fact that he was so often dull\r\nwith Ruth, with whom, of all persons in the world, he wanted to appear\r\nat his best.\r\n\r\nHarry was entirely satisfied with his own situation. A bird of passage\r\nis always at its ease, having no house to build, and no responsibility.\r\nHe talked freely with Philip about Ruth, an almighty fine girl, he said,\r\nbut what the deuce she wanted to study medicine for, he couldn't see.\r\n\r\nThere was a concert one night at the Musical Fund Hall and the four had\r\narranged to go in and return by the Germantown cars. It was Philip's\r\nplan, who had engaged the seats, and promised himself an evening with\r\nRuth, walking with her, sitting by her in the hall, and enjoying the\r\nfeeling of protecting that a man always has of a woman in a public\r\nplace. He was fond of music, too, in a sympathetic way; at least, he\r\nknew that Ruth's delight in it would be enough for him.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he meant to take advantage of the occasion to say some very\r\nserious things. His love for Ruth was no secret to Mrs. Bolton, and he\r\nfelt almost sure that he should have no opposition in the family.\r\nMrs. Bolton had been cautious in what she said, but Philip inferred\r\neverything from her reply to his own questions, one day, \xe2\x80\x9cHas thee ever\r\nspoken thy mind to Ruth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhy shouldn't he speak his mind, and end his doubts? Ruth had been\r\nmore tricksy than usual that day, and in a flow of spirits quite\r\ninconsistent, it would seem, in a young lady devoted to grave studies.\r\n\r\nHad Ruth a premonition of Philip's intention, in his manner? It may be,\r\nfor when the girls came down stairs, ready to walk to the cars; and met\r\nPhilip and Harry in the hall, Ruth said, laughing,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe two tallest must walk together\xe2\x80\x9d and before Philip knew how it\r\nhappened Ruth had taken Harry's arm, and his evening was spoiled. He had\r\ntoo much politeness and good sense and kindness to show in his manner\r\nthat he was hit. So he said to Harry,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's your disadvantage in being short.\xe2\x80\x9d And he gave Alice no reason\r\nto feel during the evening that she would not have been his first choice\r\nfor the excursion. But he was none the less chagrined, and not a little\r\nangry at the turn the affair took.\r\n\r\nThe Hall was crowded with the fashion of the town. The concert was one\r\nof those fragmentary drearinesses that people endure because they are\r\nfashionable; tours de force on the piano, and fragments from operas,\r\nwhich have no meaning without the setting, with weary pauses of waiting\r\nbetween; there is the comic basso who is so amusing and on such familiar\r\nterms with the audience, and always sings the Barber; the attitudinizing\r\ntenor, with his languishing \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Summer Night;\xe2\x80\x9d the soprano with her\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBatti Batti,\xe2\x80\x9d who warbles and trills and runs and fetches her breath,\r\nand ends with a noble scream that brings down a tempest of applause in\r\nthe midst of which she backs off the stage smiling and bowing. It was\r\nthis sort of concert, and Philip was thinking that it was the most\r\nstupid one he ever sat through, when just as the soprano was in the\r\nmidst of that touching ballad, \xe2\x80\x9cComin' thro' the Rye\xe2\x80\x9d (the soprano\r\nalways sings \xe2\x80\x9cComin' thro' the Rye\xe2\x80\x9d on an encore)--the Black Swan used\r\nto make it irresistible, Philip remembered, with her arch, \xe2\x80\x9cIf a body\r\nkiss a body\xe2\x80\x9d there was a cry of \xe2\x80\x9cFire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hall is long and narrow, and there is only one place of egress.\r\nInstantly the audience was on its feet, and a rush began for the door.\r\nMen shouted, women screamed, and panic seized the swaying mass. A\r\nsecond's thought would have convinced every one that getting out was\r\nimpossible, and that the only effect of a rush would be to crash people\r\nto death. But a second's thought was not given. A few cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d but the mass was turned towards the door. Women\r\nwere down and trampled on in the aisles, and stout men, utterly lost to\r\nself-control, were mounting the benches, as if to run a race over the\r\nmass to the entrance.\r\n\r\nPhilip who had forced the girls to keep their seats saw, in a flash, the\r\nnew danger, and sprang to avert it. In a second more those infuriated\r\nmen would be over the benches and crushing Ruth and Alice under their\r\nboots. He leaped upon the bench in front of them and struck out before\r\nhim with all his might, felling one man who was rushing on him, and\r\nchecking for an instant the movement, or rather parting it, and causing\r\nit to flow on either side of him. But it was only for an instant; the\r\npressure behind was too great, and, the next Philip was dashed backwards\r\nover the seat.\r\n\r\nAnd yet that instant of arrest had probably saved the girls, for as\r\nPhilip fell, the orchestra struck up \xe2\x80\x9cYankee Doodle\xe2\x80\x9d in the liveliest\r\nmanner. The familiar tune caught the ear of the mass, which paused in\r\nwonder, and gave the conductor's voice a chance to be heard--\xe2\x80\x9cIt's a\r\nfalse alarm!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tumult was over in a minute, and the next, laughter was heard, and\r\nnot a few said, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew it wasn't anything.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat fools people are at\r\nsuch a time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe concert was over, however. A good many people were hurt, some of\r\nthem seriously, and among them Philip Sterling was found bent across the\r\nseat, insensible, with his left arm hanging limp and a bleeding wound on\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nWhen he was carried into the air he revived, and said it was nothing.\r\nA surgeon was called, and it was thought best to drive at once to the\r\nBolton's, the surgeon supporting Philip, who did not speak the whole\r\nway. His arm was set and his head dressed, and the surgeon said he would\r\ncome round all right in his mind by morning; he was very weak. Alice\r\nwho was not much frightened while the panic lasted in the hall, was very\r\nmuch unnerved by seeing Philip so pale and bloody. Ruth assisted the\r\nsurgeon with the utmost coolness and with skillful hands helped to dress\r\nPhilip's wounds. And there was a certain intentness and fierce energy in\r\nwhat she did that might have revealed something to Philip if he had been\r\nin his senses.\r\n\r\nBut he was not, or he would not have murmured \xe2\x80\x9cLet Alice do it, she is\r\nnot too tall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Ruth's first case.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nWashington's delight in his beautiful sister was measureless. He said\r\nthat she had always been the queenliest creature in the land, but\r\nthat she was only commonplace before, compared to what she was now, so\r\nextraordinary was the improvement wrought by rich fashionable attire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your criticisms are too full of brotherly partiality to be depended\r\non, Washington. Other people will judge differently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed they won't. You'll see. There will never be a woman in\r\nWashington that can compare with you. You'll be famous within a\r\nfortnight, Laura. Everybody will want to know you. You wait--you'll\r\nsee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura wished in her heart that the prophecy might come true; and\r\nprivately she even believed it might--for she had brought all the women\r\nwhom she had seen since she left home under sharp inspection, and the\r\nresult had not been unsatisfactory to her.\r\n\r\nDuring a week or two Washington drove about the city every day with her\r\nand familiarized her with all of its salient features. She was beginning\r\nto feel very much at home with the town itself, and she was also fast\r\nacquiring ease with the distinguished people she met at the Dilworthy\r\ntable, and losing what little of country timidity she had brought with\r\nher from Hawkeye. She noticed with secret pleasure the little start of\r\nadmiration that always manifested itself in the faces of the guests\r\nwhen she entered the drawing-room arrayed in evening costume: she took\r\ncomforting note of the fact that these guests directed a very liberal\r\nshare of their conversation toward her; she observed with surprise,\r\nthat famous statesmen and soldiers did not talk like gods, as a general\r\nthing, but said rather commonplace things for the most part; and she\r\nwas filled with gratification to discover that she, on the contrary, was\r\nmaking a good many shrewd speeches and now and then a really brilliant\r\none, and furthermore, that they were beginning to be repeated in social\r\ncircles about the town.\r\n\r\nCongress began its sittings, and every day or two Washington escorted\r\nher to the galleries set apart for lady members of the households\r\nof Senators and Representatives. Here was a larger field and a wider\r\ncompetition, but still she saw that many eyes were uplifted toward her\r\nface, and that first one person and then another called a neighbor's\r\nattention to her; she was not too dull to perceive that the speeches of\r\nsome of the younger statesmen were delivered about as much and perhaps\r\nmore at her than to the presiding officer; and she was not sorry to see\r\nthat the dapper young Senator from Iowa came at once and stood in the\r\nopen space before the president's desk to exhibit his feet as soon\r\nas she entered the gallery, whereas she had early learned from common\r\nreport that his usual custom was to prop them on his desk and enjoy them\r\nhimself with a selfish disregard of other people's longings.\r\n\r\nInvitations began to flow in upon her and soon she was fairly \xe2\x80\x9cin\r\nsociety.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe season\xe2\x80\x9d was now in full bloom, and the first select\r\nreception was at hand--that is to say, a reception confined to invited\r\nguests. Senator Dilworthy had become well convinced, by this time, that\r\nhis judgment of the country-bred Missouri girl had not deceived him--it\r\nwas plain that she was going to be a peerless missionary in the field of\r\nlabor he designed her for, and therefore it would be perfectly safe and\r\nlikewise judicious to send her forth well panoplied for her work.--So\r\nhe had added new and still richer costumes to her wardrobe, and assisted\r\ntheir attractions with costly jewelry--loans on the future land sale.\r\n\r\nThis first select reception took place at a cabinet minister's--or\r\nrather a cabinet secretary's mansion. When Laura and the Senator\r\narrived, about half past nine or ten in the evening, the place was\r\nalready pretty well crowded, and the white-gloved negro servant at the\r\ndoor was still receiving streams of guests.--The drawing-rooms were\r\nbrilliant with gaslight, and as hot as ovens. The host and hostess stood\r\njust within the door of entrance; Laura was presented, and then she\r\npassed on into the maelstrom of be-jeweled and richly attired low-necked\r\nladies and white-kid-gloved and steel pen-coated gentlemen and wherever\r\nshe moved she was followed by a buzz of admiration that was grateful to\r\nall her senses--so grateful, indeed, that her white face was tinged and\r\nits beauty heightened by a perceptible suffusion of color. She caught\r\nsuch remarks as, \xe2\x80\x9cWho is she?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSuperb woman!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat is the new beauty\r\nfrom the west,\xe2\x80\x9d etc., etc.\r\n\r\nWhenever she halted, she was presently surrounded by Ministers,\r\nGenerals, Congressmen, and all manner of aristocratic people.\r\nIntroductions followed, and then the usual original question, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do\r\nyou like Washington, Miss Hawkins?\xe2\x80\x9d supplemented by that other usual\r\noriginal question, \xe2\x80\x9cIs this your first visit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese two exciting topics being exhausted, conversation generally\r\ndrifted into calmer channels, only to be interrupted at frequent\r\nintervals by new introductions and new inquiries as to how Laura liked\r\nthe capital and whether it was her first visit or not. And thus for\r\nan hour or more the Duchess moved through the crush in a rapture of\r\nhappiness, for her doubts were dead and gone, now she knew she could\r\nconquer here. A familiar face appeared in the midst of the multitude and\r\nHarry Brierly fought his difficult way to her side, his eyes shouting\r\ntheir gratification, so to speak:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, this is a happiness! Tell me, my dear Miss Hawkins--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSh! I know what you are going to ask. I do like Washington--I like it\r\never so much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I was going to ask--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am coming to it, coming to it as fast as I can. It is my first\r\nvisit. I think you should know that yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd straightway a wave of the crowd swept her beyond his reach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow what can the girl mean? Of course she likes Washington--I'm not\r\nsuch a dummy as to have to ask her that. And as to its being her first\r\nvisit, why bang it, she knows that I knew it was. Does she think I have\r\nturned idiot? Curious girl, anyway. But how they do swarm about her! She\r\nis the reigning belle of Washington after this night. She'll know five\r\nhundred of the heaviest guns in the town before this night's nonsense is\r\nover. And this isn't even the beginning. Just as I used to say--she'll\r\nbe a card in the matter of--yes sir! She shall turn the men's heads\r\nand I'll turn the women's! What a team that will be in politics here. I\r\nwouldn't take a quarter of a million for what I can do in this present\r\nsession--no indeed I wouldn't. Now, here--I don't altogether like this.\r\nThat insignificant secretary of legation is--why, she's smiling on him\r\nas if he--and now on the Admiral! Now she's illuminating that stuffy\r\nCongressman from Massachusetts--vulgar ungrammatcal shovel-maker--greasy\r\nknave of spades. I don't like this sort of thing. She doesn't appear to\r\nbe much distressed about me--she hasn't looked this way once. All right,\r\nmy bird of Paradise, if it suits you, go on. But I think I know your\r\nsex. I'll go to smiling around a little, too, and see what effect that\r\nwill have on you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he did \xe2\x80\x9csmile around a little,\xe2\x80\x9d and got as near to her as he could\r\nto watch the effect, but the scheme was a failure--he could not get her\r\nattention. She seemed wholly unconscious of him, and so he could not\r\nflirt with any spirit; he could only talk disjointedly; he could not\r\nkeep his eyes on the charmers he talked to; he grew irritable, jealous,\r\nand very unhappy. He gave up his enterprise, leaned his shoulder against\r\na fluted pilaster and pouted while he kept watch upon Laura's every\r\nmovement. His other shoulder stole the bloom from many a lovely cheek\r\nthat brushed him in the surging crush, but he noted it not. He was too\r\nbusy cursing himself inwardly for being an egotistical imbecile. An hour\r\nago he had thought to take this country lass under his protection and\r\nshow her \xe2\x80\x9clife\xe2\x80\x9d and enjoy her wonder and delight--and here she was,\r\nimmersed in the marvel up to her eyes, and just a trifle more at home in\r\nit than he was himself. And now his angry comments ran on again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow she's sweetening old Brother Balaam; and he--well he is inviting\r\nher to the Congressional prayer-meeting, no doubt--better let old\r\nDilworthy alone to see that she doesn't overlook that. And now its\r\nSplurge, of New York; and now its Batters of New Hampshire--and now the\r\nVice President! Well I may as well adjourn. I've got enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he hadn't. He got as far as the door--and then struggled back to\r\ntake one more look, hating himself all the while for his weakness.\r\n\r\nToward midnight, when supper was announced, the crowd thronged to the\r\nsupper room where a long table was decked out with what seemed a rare\r\nrepast, but which consisted of things better calculated to feast the eye\r\nthan the appetite. The ladies were soon seated in files along the wall,\r\nand in groups here and there, and the colored waiters filled the plates\r\nand glasses and the male guests moved hither and thither conveying them\r\nto the privileged sex.\r\n\r\nHarry took an ice and stood up by the table with other gentlemen, and\r\nlistened to the buzz of conversation while he ate.\r\n\r\nFrom these remarks he learned a good deal about Laura that was news to\r\nhim. For instance, that she was of a distinguished western family;\r\nthat she was highly educated; that she was very rich and a great\r\nlanded heiress; that she was not a professor of religion, and yet was a\r\nChristian in the truest and best sense of the word, for her whole heart\r\nwas devoted to the accomplishment of a great and noble enterprise--none\r\nother than the sacrificing of her landed estates to the uplifting of the\r\ndown-trodden negro and the turning of his erring feet into the way of\r\nlight and righteousness. Harry observed that as soon as one listener\r\nhad absorbed the story, he turned about and delivered it to his next\r\nneighbor and the latter individual straightway passed it on. And thus he\r\nsaw it travel the round of the gentlemen and overflow rearward among the\r\nladies. He could not trace it backward to its fountain head, and so he\r\ncould not tell who it was that started it.\r\n\r\nOne thing annoyed Harry a great deal; and that was the reflection\r\nthat he might have been in Washington days and days ago and thrown his\r\nfascinations about Laura with permanent effect while she was new and\r\nstrange to the capital, instead of dawdling in Philadelphia to no\r\npurpose. He feared he had \xe2\x80\x9cmissed a trick,\xe2\x80\x9d as he expressed it.\r\n\r\nHe only found one little opportunity of speaking again with Laura before\r\nthe evening's festivities ended, and then, for the first time in years,\r\nhis airy self-complacency failed him, his tongue's easy confidence\r\nforsook it in a great measure, and he was conscious of an unheroic\r\ntimidity. He was glad to get away and find a place where he could\r\ndespise himself in private and try to grow his clipped plumes again.\r\n\r\nWhen Laura reached home she was tired but exultant, and Senator\r\nDilworthy was pleased and satisfied. He called Laura \xe2\x80\x9cmy daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d next\r\nmorning, and gave her some \xe2\x80\x9cpin money,\xe2\x80\x9d as he termed it, and she sent\r\na hundred and fifty dollars of it to her mother and loaned a trifle to\r\nCol. Sellers. Then the Senator had a long private conference with Laura,\r\nand unfolded certain plans of his for the good of the country, and\r\nreligion, and the poor, and temperance, and showed her how she could\r\nassist him in developing these worthy and noble enterprises.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nLaura soon discovered that there were three distinct aristocracies\r\nin Washington. One of these, (nick-named the Antiques,) consisted of\r\ncultivated, high-bred old families who looked back with pride upon an\r\nancestry that had been always great in the nation's councils and its\r\nwars from the birth of the republic downward. Into this select circle it\r\nwas difficult to gain admission. No. 2 was the aristocracy of the middle\r\nground--of which, more anon. No. 3 lay beyond; of it we will say a word\r\nhere. We will call it the Aristocracy of the Parvenus--as, indeed, the\r\ngeneral public did. Official position, no matter how obtained, entitled\r\na man to a place in it, and carried his family with him, no matter\r\nwhence they sprang. Great wealth gave a man a still higher and nobler\r\nplace in it than did official position. If this wealth had been\r\nacquired by conspicuous ingenuity, with just a pleasant little spice of\r\nillegality about it, all the better. This aristocracy was \xe2\x80\x9cfast,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nnot averse to ostentation.\r\n\r\nThe aristocracy of the Antiques ignored the aristocracy of the Parvenus;\r\nthe Parvenus laughed at the Antiques, (and secretly envied them.)\r\n\r\nThere were certain important \xe2\x80\x9csociety\xe2\x80\x9d customs which one in Laura's\r\nposition needed to understand. For instance, when a lady of any\r\nprominence comes to one of our cities and takes up her residence, all\r\nthe ladies of her grade favor her in turn with an initial call, giving\r\ntheir cards to the servant at the door by way of introduction. They come\r\nsingly, sometimes; sometimes in couples; and always in elaborate full\r\ndress. They talk two minutes and a quarter and then go. If the lady\r\nreceiving the call desires a further acquaintance, she must return the\r\nvisit within two weeks; to neglect it beyond that time means \xe2\x80\x9clet the\r\nmatter drop.\xe2\x80\x9d But if she does return the visit within two weeks, it then\r\nbecomes the other party's privilege to continue the acquaintance or drop\r\nit. She signifies her willingness to continue it by calling again any\r\ntime within twelve-months; after that, if the parties go on calling upon\r\neach other once a year, in our large cities, that is sufficient, and\r\nthe acquaintanceship holds good. The thing goes along smoothly, now. The\r\nannual visits are made and returned with peaceful regularity and bland\r\nsatisfaction, although it is not necessary that the two ladies shall\r\nactually see each other oftener than once every few years. Their cards\r\npreserve the intimacy and keep the acquaintanceship intact.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Mrs. A. pays her annual visit, sits in her carriage and\r\nsends in her card with the lower right hand corner turned down, which\r\nsignifies that she has \xe2\x80\x9ccalled in person;\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. B: sends down word that\r\nshe is \xe2\x80\x9cengaged\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwishes to be excused\xe2\x80\x9d--or if she is a Parvenu and\r\nlow-bred, she perhaps sends word that she is \xe2\x80\x9cnot at home.\xe2\x80\x9d Very good;\r\nMrs. A. drives on happy and content. If Mrs. A.'s daughter marries, or\r\na child is born to the family, Mrs. B. calls, sends in her card with\r\nthe upper left hand corner turned down, and then goes along about her\r\naffairs--for that inverted corner means \xe2\x80\x9cCongratulations.\xe2\x80\x9d If Mrs. B.'s\r\nhusband falls downstairs and breaks his neck, Mrs. A. calls, leaves her\r\ncard with the upper right hand corner turned down, and then takes her\r\ndeparture; this corner means \xe2\x80\x9cCondolence.\xe2\x80\x9d It is very necessary to get\r\nthe corners right, else one may unintentionally condole with a friend on\r\na wedding or congratulate her upon a funeral. If either lady is about to\r\nleave the city, she goes to the other's house and leaves her card with\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP. P. C.\xe2\x80\x9d engraved under the name--which signifies, \xe2\x80\x9cPay Parting Call.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n But enough of etiquette. Laura was early instructed in the mysteries\r\nof society life by a competent mentor, and thus was preserved from\r\ntroublesome mistakes.\r\n\r\nThe first fashionable call she received from a member of the ancient\r\nnobility, otherwise the Antiques, was of a pattern with all she received\r\nfrom that limb of the aristocracy afterward. This call was paid by Mrs.\r\nMajor-General Fulke-Fulkerson and daughter. They drove up at one in the\r\nafternoon in a rather antiquated vehicle with a faded coat of arms on\r\nthe panels, an aged white-wooled negro coachman on the box and a younger\r\ndarkey beside him--the footman. Both of these servants were dressed in\r\ndull brown livery that had seen considerable service.\r\n\r\nThe ladies entered the drawing-room in full character; that is to say,\r\nwith Elizabethan stateliness on the part of the dowager, and an easy\r\ngrace and dignity on the part of the young lady that had a nameless\r\nsomething about it that suggested conscious superiority. The dresses of\r\nboth ladies were exceedingly rich, as to material, but as notably modest\r\nas to color and ornament. All parties having seated themselves, the\r\ndowager delivered herself of a remark that was not unusual in its form,\r\nand yet it came from her lips with the impressiveness of Scripture:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe weather has been unpropitious of late, Miss Hawkins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Laura. \xe2\x80\x9cThe climate seems to be variable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is its nature of old, here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the daughter--stating it\r\napparently as a fact, only, and by her manner waving aside all personal\r\nresponsibility on account of it. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not so, mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so, my child. Do you like winter, Miss Hawkins?\xe2\x80\x9d She said \xe2\x80\x9clike\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n as if she had an idea that its dictionary meaning was \xe2\x80\x9capprove of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot as well as summer--though I think all seasons have their charms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a very just remark. The general held similar views. He considered\r\nsnow in winter proper; sultriness in summer legitimate; frosts in the\r\nautumn the same, and rains in spring not objectionable. He was not an\r\nexacting man. And I call to mind now that he always admired thunder. You\r\nremember, child, your father always admired thunder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe adored it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt it reminded him of battle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Laura.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think perhaps it did. He had a great respect for Nature. He\r\noften said there was something striking about the ocean. You remember\r\nhis saying that, daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, often, Mother. I remember it very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd hurricanes... He took a great interest in hurricanes. And animals.\r\nDogs, especially--hunting dogs. Also comets. I think we all have our\r\npredilections. I think it is this that gives variety to our tastes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura coincided with this view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you find it hard and lonely to be so far from your home and friends,\r\nMiss Hawkins?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do find it depressing sometimes, but then there is so much about\r\nme here that is novel and interesting that my days are made up more of\r\nsunshine than shadow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWashington is not a dull city in the season,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young lady. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nhave some very good society indeed, and one need not be at a loss for\r\nmeans to pass the time pleasantly. Are you fond of watering-places, Miss\r\nHawkins?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have really had no experience of them, but I have always felt a\r\nstrong desire to see something of fashionable watering-place life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe of Washington are unfortunately situated in that respect,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ndowager. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a tedious distance to Newport. But there is no help for\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura said to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cLong Branch and Cape May are nearer than\r\nNewport; doubtless these places are low; I'll feel my way a little and\r\nsee.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she said aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy I thought that Long Branch--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no need to \xe2\x80\x9cfeel\xe2\x80\x9d any further--there was that in both faces\r\nbefore her which made that truth apparent. The dowager said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody goes there, Miss Hawkins--at least only persons of no position\r\nin society. And the President.\xe2\x80\x9d She added that with tranquility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNewport is damp, and cold, and windy and excessively disagreeable,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said the daughter, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is very select. One cannot be fastidious\r\nabout minor matters when one has no choice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe visit had spun out nearly three minutes, now. Both ladies rose with\r\ngrave dignity, conferred upon Laura a formal invitation to call, and\r\nthen retired from the conference. Laura remained in the drawing-room and\r\nleft them to pilot themselves out of the house--an inhospitable thing,\r\nit seemed to her, but then she was following her instructions. She\r\nstood, steeped in reverie, a while, and then she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I could always enjoy icebergs--as scenery but not as company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill, she knew these two people by reputation, and was aware that they\r\nwere not ice-bergs when they were in their own waters and amid their\r\nlegitimate surroundings, but on the contrary were people to be respected\r\nfor their stainless characters and esteemed for their social virtues\r\nand their benevolent impulses. She thought it a pity that they had to be\r\nsuch changed and dreary creatures on occasions of state.\r\n\r\nThe first call Laura received from the other extremity of the Washington\r\naristocracy followed close upon the heels of the one we have just been\r\ndescribing. The callers this time were the Hon. Mrs. Oliver Higgins,\r\nthe Hon. Mrs. Patrique Oreille (pronounced O-relay,) Miss Bridget\r\n(pronounced Breezhay) Oreille, Mrs. Peter Gashly, Miss Gashly, and Miss\r\nEmmeline Gashly.\r\n\r\nThe three carriages arrived at the same moment from different\r\ndirections. They were new and wonderfully shiny, and the brasses on the\r\nharness were highly polished and bore complicated monograms. There were\r\nshowy coats of arms, too, with Latin mottoes. The coachmen and footmen\r\nwere clad in bright new livery, of striking colors, and they had black\r\nrosettes with shaving-brushes projecting above them, on the sides of\r\ntheir stove-pipe hats.\r\n\r\nWhen the visitors swept into the drawing-room they filled the place with\r\na suffocating sweetness procured at the perfumer's. Their costumes,\r\nas to architecture, were the latest fashion intensified; they were\r\nrainbow-hued; they were hung with jewels--chiefly diamonds. It would\r\nhave been plain to any eye that it had cost something to upholster these\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Mrs. Oliver Higgins was the wife of a delegate from a distant\r\nterritory--a gentleman who had kept the principal \xe2\x80\x9csaloon,\xe2\x80\x9d and sold\r\nthe best whiskey in the principal village in his wilderness, and so,\r\nof course, was recognized as the first man of his commonwealth and its\r\nfittest representative.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of paramount influence at home, for he was public spirited,\r\nhe was chief of the fire department, he had an admirable command of\r\nprofane language, and had killed several \xe2\x80\x9cparties.\xe2\x80\x9d His shirt fronts\r\nwere always immaculate; his boots daintily polished, and no man could\r\nlift a foot and fire a dead shot at a stray speck of dirt on it with a\r\nwhite handkerchief with a finer grace than he; his watch chain weighed a\r\npound; the gold in his finger ring was worth forty five dollars; he wore\r\na diamond cluster-pin and he parted his hair behind. He had always been\r\nregarded as the most elegant gentleman in his territory, and it was\r\nconceded by all that no man thereabouts was anywhere near his equal\r\nin the telling of an obscene story except the venerable white-haired\r\ngovernor himself. The Hon. Higgins had not come to serve his country\r\nin Washington for nothing. The appropriation which he had engineered\r\nthrough Congress for the maintenance of the Indians in his Territory\r\nwould have made all those savages rich if it had ever got to them.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Mrs. Higgins was a picturesque woman, and a fluent talker, and\r\nshe held a tolerably high station among the Parvenus. Her English was\r\nfair enough, as a general thing--though, being of New York origin, she\r\nhad the fashion peculiar to many natives of that city of pronouncing saw\r\nand law as if they were spelt sawr and lawr.\r\n\r\nPetroleum was the agent that had suddenly transformed the Gashlys from\r\nmodest hard-working country village folk into \xe2\x80\x9cloud\xe2\x80\x9d aristocrats and\r\nornaments of the city.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Patrique Oreille was a wealthy Frenchman from Cork. Not that he\r\nwas wealthy when he first came from Cork, but just the reverse. When\r\nhe first landed in New York with his wife, he had only halted at Castle\r\nGarden for a few minutes to receive and exhibit papers showing that he\r\nhad resided in this country two years--and then he voted the democratic\r\nticket and went up town to hunt a house. He found one and then went to\r\nwork as assistant to an architect and builder, carrying a hod all day\r\nand studying politics evenings. Industry and economy soon enabled him\r\nto start a low rum shop in a foul locality, and this gave him political\r\ninfluence. In our country it is always our first care to see that\r\nour people have the opportunity of voting for their choice of men to\r\nrepresent and govern them--we do not permit our great officials to\r\nappoint the little officials. We prefer to have so tremendous a power\r\nas that in our own hands. We hold it safest to elect our judges and\r\neverybody else. In our cities, the ward meetings elect delegates to the\r\nnominating conventions and instruct them whom to nominate. The publicans\r\nand their retainers rule the ward meetings (for everybody else hates\r\nthe worry of politics and stays at home); the delegates from the ward\r\nmeetings organize as a nominating convention and make up a list\r\nof candidates--one convention offering a democratic and another a\r\nrepublican list of incorruptibles; and then the great meek public come\r\nforward at the proper time and make unhampered choice and bless Heaven\r\nthat they live in a free land where no form of despotism can ever\r\nintrude.\r\n\r\nPatrick O'Riley (as his name then stood) created friends and influence\r\nvery fast, for he was always on hand at the police courts to give straw\r\nbail for his customers or establish an alibi for them in case they had\r\nbeen beating anybody to death on his premises. Consequently he presently\r\nbecame a political leader, and was elected to a petty office under the\r\ncity government. Out of a meager salary he soon saved money enough to\r\nopen quite a stylish liquor saloon higher up town, with a faro bank\r\nattached and plenty of capital to conduct it with. This gave him fame\r\nand great respectability. The position of alderman was forced upon him,\r\nand it was just the same as presenting him a gold mine. He had fine\r\nhorses and carriages, now, and closed up his whiskey mill.\r\n\r\nBy and by he became a large contractor for city work, and was a bosom\r\nfriend of the great and good Wm. M. Weed himself, who had stolen\r\n$20,600,000 from the city and was a man so envied, so honored,--so\r\nadored, indeed, that when the sheriff went to his office to arrest\r\nhim as a felon, that sheriff blushed and apologized, and one of the\r\nillustrated papers made a picture of the scene and spoke of the matter\r\nin such a way as to show that the editor regretted that the offense of\r\nan arrest had been offered to so exalted a personage as Mr. Weed.\r\n\r\nMr. O'Riley furnished shingle nails to the new Court House at three\r\nthousand dollars a keg, and eighteen gross of 60-cent thermometers at\r\nfifteen hundred dollars a dozen; the controller and the board of audit\r\npassed the bills, and a mayor, who was simply ignorant but not criminal,\r\nsigned them. When they were paid, Mr. O'Riley's admirers gave him a\r\nsolitaire diamond pin of the size of a filbert, in imitation of the\r\nliberality of Mr. Weed's friends, and then Mr. O'Riley retired from\r\nactive service and amused himself with buying real estate at enormous\r\nfigures and holding it in other people's names. By and by the\r\nnewspapers came out with exposures and called Weed and O'Riley\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthieves,\xe2\x80\x9d--whereupon the people rose as one man (voting repeatedly)\r\nand elected the two gentlemen to their proper theatre of action, the New\r\nYork legislature. The newspapers clamored, and the courts proceeded to\r\ntry the new legislators for their small irregularities. Our admirable\r\njury system enabled the persecuted ex-officials to secure a jury of nine\r\ngentlemen from a neighboring asylum and three graduates from Sing-Sing,\r\nand presently they walked forth with characters vindicated. The\r\nlegislature was called upon to spew them forth--a thing which the\r\nlegislature declined to do. It was like asking children to repudiate\r\ntheir own father. It was a legislature of the modern pattern.\r\n\r\nBeing now wealthy and distinguished, Mr. O'Riley, still bearing the\r\nlegislative \xe2\x80\x9cHon.\xe2\x80\x9d attached to his name (for titles never die in\r\nAmerica, although we do take a republican pride in poking fun at such\r\ntrifles), sailed for Europe with his family. They traveled all about,\r\nturning their noses up at every thing, and not finding it a difficult\r\nthing to do, either, because nature had originally given those features\r\na cast in that direction; and finally they established themselves in\r\nParis, that Paradise of Americans of their sort.--They staid there two\r\nyears and learned to speak English with a foreign accent--not that it\r\nhadn't always had a foreign accent (which was indeed the case) but now\r\nthe nature of it was changed. Finally they returned home and became\r\nultra fashionables. They landed here as the Hon. Patrique Oreille and\r\nfamily, and so are known unto this day.\r\n\r\nLaura provided seats for her visitors and they immediately launched\r\nforth into a breezy, sparkling conversation with that easy confidence\r\nwhich is to be found only among persons accustomed to high life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI've been intending to call sooner, Miss Hawkins,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Hon. Mrs.\r\nOreille, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the weather's been so horrid. How do you like Washington?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura liked it very well indeed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gashly--\xe2\x80\x9cIs it your first visit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, it was her first.\r\n\r\nAll--\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Oreille--\xe2\x80\x9cI'm afraid you'll despise the weather, Miss Hawkins. It's\r\nperfectly awful. It always is. I tell Mr. Oreille I can't and I won't\r\nput up with any such a climate. If we were obliged to do it, I wouldn't\r\nmind it; but we are not obliged to, and so I don't see the use of it.\r\nSometimes its real pitiful the way the childern pine for Parry--don't\r\nlook so sad, Bridget, 'ma chere'--poor child, she can't hear Parry\r\nmentioned without getting the blues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Gashly--\xe2\x80\x9cWell I should think so, Mrs. Oreille. A body lives in\r\nParis, but a body, only stays here. I dote on Paris; I'd druther scrimp\r\nalong on ten thousand dollars a year there, than suffer and worry here\r\non a real decent income.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Gashly--\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, I wish you'd take us back, mother; I'm sure I\r\nhate this stoopid country enough, even if it is our dear native land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Emmeline Gashly--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat and leave poor Johnny Peterson behind?\xe2\x80\x9d [An\r\nairy genial laugh applauded this sally].\r\n\r\nMiss Gashly--\xe2\x80\x9cSister, I should think you'd be ashamed of yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Emmeline--\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you needn't ruffle your feathers so: I was\r\nonly joking. He don't mean anything by coming to the house every\r\nevening--only comes to see mother. Of course that's all!\xe2\x80\x9d [General\r\nlaughter].\r\n\r\nMiss G. prettily confused--\xe2\x80\x9cEmmeline, how can you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. G.--\xe2\x80\x9cLet your sister alone, Emmeline. I never saw such a tease!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Oreille--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat lovely corals you have, Miss Hawkins! Just look\r\nat them, Bridget, dear. I've a great passion for corals--it's a pity\r\nthey're getting a little common. I have some elegant ones--not as\r\nelegant as yours, though--but of course I don't wear them now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura--\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose they are rather common, but still I have a great\r\naffection for these, because they were given to me by a dear old\r\nfriend of our family named Murphy. He was a very charming man, but very\r\neccentric. We always supposed he was an Irishman, but after he got rich\r\nhe went abroad for a year or two, and when he came back you would have\r\nbeen amused to see how interested he was in a potato.\r\n\r\nHe asked what it was! Now you know that when Providence shapes a mouth\r\nespecially for the accommodation of a potato you can detect that fact at\r\na glance when that mouth is in repose--foreign travel can never remove\r\nthat sign. But he was a very delightful gentleman, and his little foible\r\ndid not hurt him at all. We all have our shams--I suppose there is a\r\nsham somewhere about every individual, if we could manage to ferret\r\nit out. I would so like to go to France. I suppose our society here\r\ncompares very favorably with French society does it not, Mrs. Oreille?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. O.--\xe2\x80\x9cNot by any means, Miss Hawkins! French society is much more\r\nelegant--much more so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura--\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to hear that. I suppose ours has deteriorated of\r\nlate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. O.--\xe2\x80\x9cVery much indeed. There are people in society here that have\r\nreally no more money to live on than what some of us pay for servant\r\nhire. Still I won't say but what some of them are very good people--and\r\nrespectable, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura--\xe2\x80\x9cThe old families seem to be holding themselves aloof, from what\r\nI hear. I suppose you seldom meet in society now, the people you used to\r\nbe familiar with twelve or fifteen years ago?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. O.--\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no-hardly ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. O'Riley kept his first rum-mill and protected his customers from\r\nthe law in those days, and this turn of the conversation was rather\r\nuncomfortable to madame than otherwise.\r\n\r\nHon. Mrs. Higgins--\xe2\x80\x9cIs Francois' health good now, Mrs. Oreille?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. O.--(Thankful for the intervention)--\xe2\x80\x9cNot very. A body couldn't\r\nexpect it. He was always delicate--especially his lungs--and this odious\r\nclimate tells on him strong, now, after Parry, which is so mild.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. H:--\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so. Husband says Percy'll die if he don't have\r\na change; and so I'm going to swap round a little and see what can be\r\ndone. I saw a lady from Florida last week, and she recommended Key\r\nWest. I told her Percy couldn't abide winds, as he was threatened with a\r\npulmonary affection, and then she said try St. Augustine. It's an awful\r\ndistance--ten or twelve hundred mile, they say but then in a case of\r\nthis kind--a body can't stand back for trouble, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. O.--\xe2\x80\x9cNo, of course that's off. If Francois don't get better soon\r\nwe've got to look out for some other place, or else Europe. We've\r\nthought some of the Hot Springs, but I don't know. It's a great\r\nresponsibility and a body wants to go cautious. Is Hildebrand about\r\nagain, Mrs. Gashly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. G.--\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but that's about all. It was indigestion, you know, and\r\nit looks as if it was chronic. And you know I do dread dyspepsia. We've\r\nall been worried a good deal about him. The doctor recommended baked\r\napple and spoiled meat, and I think it done him good. It's about the\r\nonly thing that will stay on his stomach now-a-days. We have Dr. Shovel\r\nnow. Who's your doctor, Mrs. Higgins?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. H.--\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we had Dr. Spooner a good while, but he runs so much to\r\nemetics, which I think are weakening, that we changed off and took Dr.\r\nLeathers. We like him very much. He has a fine European reputation, too.\r\nThe first thing he suggested for Percy was to have him taken out in the\r\nback yard for an airing, every afternoon, with nothing at all on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. O. and Mrs. G.--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. H.--\xe2\x80\x9cAs true as I'm sitting here. And it actually helped him for\r\ntwo or three days; it did indeed. But after that the doctor said it\r\nseemed to be too severe and so he has fell back on hot foot-baths at\r\nnight and cold showers in the morning. But I don't think there can be\r\nany good sound help for him in such a climate as this. I believe we are\r\ngoing to lose him if we don't make a change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. O. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you heard of the fright we had two weeks ago last\r\nSaturday? No? Why that is strange--but come to remember, you've all\r\nbeen away to Richmond. Francois tumbled from the sky light--in the\r\nsecond-story hall clean down to the first floor--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverybody--\xe2\x80\x9cMercy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. O.--\xe2\x80\x9cYes indeed--and broke two of his ribs--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverybody--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. O. \xe2\x80\x9cJust as true as you live. First we thought he must be injured\r\ninternally. It was fifteen minutes past 8 in the evening. Of course we\r\nwere all distracted in a moment--everybody was flying everywhere, and\r\nnobody doing anything worth anything. By and by I flung out next door\r\nand dragged in Dr. Sprague; President of the Medical University no time\r\nto go for our own doctor of course--and the minute he saw Francois he\r\nsaid, 'Send for your own physician, madam;' said it as cross as a bear,\r\ntoo, and turned right on his heel, and cleared out without doing a\r\nthing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverybody--\xe2\x80\x9cThe mean, contemptible brute!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. O--\xe2\x80\x9cWell you may say it. I was nearly out of my wits by this time.\r\nBut we hurried off the servants after our own doctor and telegraphed\r\nmother--she was in New York and rushed down on the first train; and when\r\nthe doctor got there, lo and behold you he found Francois had broke one\r\nof his legs, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverybody--\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. O.--\xe2\x80\x9cYes. So he set his leg and bandaged it up, and fixed his ribs\r\nand gave him a dose of something to quiet down his excitement and put\r\nhim to sleep--poor thing he was trembling and frightened to death and it\r\nwas pitiful to see him. We had him in my bed--Mr. Oreille slept in the\r\nguest room and I laid down beside Francois--but not to sleep bless you\r\nno. Bridget and I set up all night, and the doctor staid till two in the\r\nmorning, bless his old heart.--When mother got there she was so used up\r\nwith anxiety, that she had to go to bed and have the doctor; but when\r\nshe found that Francois was not in immediate danger she rallied, and\r\nby night she was able to take a watch herself. Well for three days and\r\nnights we three never left that bedside only to take an hour's nap at\r\na time. And then the doctor said Francois was out of danger and if ever\r\nthere was a thankful set, in this world, it was us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura's respect for these women had augmented during this conversation,\r\nnaturally enough; affection and devotion are qualities that are able to\r\nadorn and render beautiful a character that is otherwise unattractive,\r\nand even repulsive.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gashly--\xe2\x80\x9cI do believe I should a died if I had been in your place,\r\nMrs. Oreille. The time Hildebrand was so low with the pneumonia Emmeline\r\nand me were all alone with him most of the time and we never took a\r\nminute's sleep for as much as two days and nights. It was at Newport and\r\nwe wouldn't trust hired nurses. One afternoon he had a fit, and jumped\r\nup and run out on the portico of the hotel with nothing in the world on\r\nand the wind a blowing like ice and we after him scared to death;\r\nand when the ladies and gentlemen saw that he had a fit, every lady\r\nscattered for her room and not a gentleman lifted his hand to help, the\r\nwretches! Well after that his life hung by a thread for as much as ten\r\ndays, and the minute he was out of danger Emmeline and me just went to\r\nbed sick and worn out. I never want to pass through such a time again.\r\nPoor dear Francois--which leg did he break, Mrs. Oreille!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. O.--\xe2\x80\x9cIt was his right hand hind leg. Jump down, Francois dear, and\r\nshow the ladies what a cruel limp you've got yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrancois demurred, but being coaxed and delivered gently upon the floor,\r\nhe performed very satisfactorily, with his \xe2\x80\x9cright hand hind leg\xe2\x80\x9d in the\r\nair. All were affected--even Laura--but hers was an affection of the\r\nstomach. The country-bred girl had not suspected that the little whining\r\nten-ounce black and tan reptile, clad in a red embroidered pigmy\r\nblanket and reposing in Mrs. Oreille's lap all through the visit was the\r\nindividual whose sufferings had been stirring the dormant generosities\r\nof her nature. She said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor little creature! You might have lost him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. O.--\xe2\x80\x9cO pray don't mention it, Miss Hawkins--it gives me such a\r\nturn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Hildebrand and Percy--are they--are they like this one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. G.--\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Hilly has considerable Skye blood in him, I believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. H.--\xe2\x80\x9cPercy's the same, only he is two months and ten days older and\r\nhas his ears cropped. His father, Martin Farquhar Tupper, was sickly,\r\nand died young, but he was the sweetest disposition.--His mother had\r\nheart disease but was very gentle and resigned, and a wonderful ratter.\xe2\x80\x9d As impossible and exasperating as this conversation may sound to a person who is not an idiot, it is scarcely in any respect an exaggeration of one which one of us actually listened to in an American drawing room--otherwise we could not venture to put such a chapter into a book which, professes to deal with social possibilities.--THE AUTHORS.]\r\nSo carried away had the visitors become by their interest attaching to\r\nthis discussion of family matters, that their stay had been prolonged to\r\na very improper and unfashionable length; but they suddenly recollected\r\nthemselves now and took their departure.\r\n\r\nLaura's scorn was boundless. The more she thought of these people and\r\ntheir extraordinary talk, the more offensive they seemed to her; and\r\nyet she confessed that if one must choose between the two extreme\r\naristocracies it might be best, on the whole, looking at things from a\r\nstrictly business point of view, to herd with the Parvenus; she was in\r\nWashington solely to compass a certain matter and to do it at any cost,\r\nand these people might be useful to her, while it was plain that her\r\npurposes and her schemes for pushing them would not find favor in the\r\neyes of the Antiques. If it came to choice--and it might come to that,\r\nsooner or later--she believed she could come to a decision without much\r\ndifficulty or many pangs.\r\n\r\nBut the best aristocracy of the three Washington castes, and really the\r\nmost powerful, by far, was that of the Middle Ground: It was made up of\r\nthe families of public men from nearly every state in the Union--men\r\nwho held positions in both the executive and legislative branches of the\r\ngovernment, and whose characters had been for years blemishless, both\r\nat home and at the capital. These gentlemen and their households were\r\nunostentatious people; they were educated and refined; they troubled\r\nthemselves but little about the two other orders of nobility, but moved\r\nserenely in their wide orbit, confident in their own strength and\r\nwell aware of the potency of their influence. They had no troublesome\r\nappearances to keep up, no rivalries which they cared to distress\r\nthemselves about, no jealousies to fret over. They could afford to mind\r\ntheir own affairs and leave other combinations to do the same or\r\ndo otherwise, just as they chose. They were people who were beyond\r\nreproach, and that was sufficient.\r\n\r\nSenator Dilworthy never came into collision with any of these factions.\r\nHe labored for them all and with them all. He said that all men\r\nwere brethren and all were entitled to the honest unselfish help and\r\ncountenance of a Christian laborer in the public vineyard.\r\n\r\nLaura concluded, after reflection, to let circumstances determine\r\nthe course it might be best for her to pursue as regarded the several\r\naristocracies.\r\n\r\nNow it might occur to the reader that perhaps Laura had been somewhat\r\nrudely suggestive in her remarks to Mrs. Oreille when the subject of\r\ncorals was under discussion, but it did not occur to Laura herself. She\r\nwas not a person of exaggerated refinement; indeed, the society and\r\nthe influences that had formed her character had not been of a nature\r\ncalculated to make her so; she thought that \xe2\x80\x9cgive and take was fair\r\nplay,\xe2\x80\x9d and that to parry an offensive thrust with a sarcasm was a neat\r\nand legitimate thing to do. She sometimes talked to people in a way\r\nwhich some ladies would consider, actually shocking; but Laura rather\r\nprided herself upon some of her exploits of that character. We are sorry\r\nwe cannot make her a faultless heroine; but we cannot, for the reason\r\nthat she was human.\r\n\r\nShe considered herself a superior conversationist. Long ago, when the\r\npossibility had first been brought before her mind that some day she\r\nmight move in Washington society, she had recognized the fact that\r\npracticed conversational powers would be a necessary weapon in that\r\nfield; she had also recognized the fact that since her dealings there\r\nmust be mainly with men, and men whom she supposed to be exceptionally\r\ncultivated and able, she would need heavier shot in her magazine than\r\nmere brilliant \xe2\x80\x9csociety\xe2\x80\x9d nothings; whereupon she had at once entered\r\nupon a tireless and elaborate course of reading, and had never since\r\nceased to devote every unoccupied moment to this sort of preparation.\r\nHaving now acquired a happy smattering of various information, she used\r\nit with good effect--she passed for a singularly well informed woman in\r\nWashington. The quality of her literary tastes had necessarily undergone\r\nconstant improvement under this regimen, and as necessarily, also the\r\nduality of her language had improved, though it cannot be denied that\r\nnow and then her former condition of life betrayed itself in just\r\nperceptible inelegancies of expression and lapses of grammar.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nWhen Laura had been in Washington three months, she was still the same\r\nperson, in one respect, that she was when she first arrived there--that\r\nis to say, she still bore the name of Laura Hawkins. Otherwise she was\r\nperceptibly changed.--\r\n\r\nShe had arrived in a state of grievous uncertainty as to what manner of\r\nwoman she was, physically and intellectually, as compared with eastern\r\nwomen; she was well satisfied, now, that her beauty was confessed, her\r\nmind a grade above the average, and her powers of fascination rather\r\nextraordinary. So she was at ease upon those points. When she arrived,\r\nshe was possessed of habits of economy and not possessed of money; now\r\nshe dressed elaborately, gave but little thought to the cost of things,\r\nand was very well fortified financially. She kept her mother and\r\nWashington freely supplied with money, and did the same by Col.\r\nSellers--who always insisted upon giving his note for loans--with\r\ninterest; he was rigid upon that; she must take interest; and one of the\r\nColonel's greatest satisfactions was to go over his accounts and note\r\nwhat a handsome sum this accruing interest amounted to, and what a\r\ncomfortable though modest support it would yield Laura in case reverses\r\nshould overtake her.\r\n\r\nIn truth he could not help feeling that he was an efficient shield for\r\nher against poverty; and so, if her expensive ways ever troubled him for\r\na brief moment, he presently dismissed the thought and said to himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet her go on--even if she loses everything she is still safe--this\r\ninterest will always afford her a good easy income.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura was on excellent terms with a great many members of Congress, and\r\nthere was an undercurrent of suspicion in some quarters that she was one\r\nof that detested class known as \xe2\x80\x9clobbyists;\xe2\x80\x9d but what belle could escape\r\nslander in such a city? Fairminded people declined to condemn her on\r\nmere suspicion, and so the injurious talk made no very damaging headway.\r\nShe was very gay, now, and very celebrated, and she might well expect to\r\nbe assailed by many kinds of gossip. She was growing used to celebrity,\r\nand could already sit calm and seemingly unconscious, under the fire of\r\nfifty lorgnettes in a theatre, or even overhear the low voice \xe2\x80\x9cThat's\r\nshe!\xe2\x80\x9d as she passed along the street without betraying annoyance.\r\n\r\nThe whole air was full of a vague vast scheme which was to eventuate in\r\nfilling Laura's pockets with millions of money; some had one idea of the\r\nscheme, and some another, but nobody had any exact knowledge upon the\r\nsubject. All that any one felt sure about, was that Laura's landed\r\nestates were princely in value and extent, and that the government was\r\nanxious to get hold of them for public purposes, and that Laura was\r\nwilling to make the sale but not at all anxious about the matter and\r\nnot at all in a hurry. It was whispered that Senator Dilworthy was a\r\nstumbling block in the way of an immediate sale, because he was\r\nresolved that the government should not have the lands except with the\r\nunderstanding that they should be devoted to the uplifting of the negro\r\nrace; Laura did not care what they were devoted to, it was said, (a\r\nworld of very different gossip to the contrary notwithstanding,) but\r\nthere were several other heirs and they would be guided entirely by the\r\nSenator's wishes; and finally, many people averred that while it would\r\nbe easy to sell the lands to the government for the benefit of the\r\nnegro, by resorting to the usual methods of influencing votes, Senator\r\nDilworthy was unwilling to have so noble a charity sullied by any taint\r\nof corruption--he was resolved that not a vote should be bought. Nobody\r\ncould get anything definite from Laura about these matters, and so\r\ngossip had to feed itself chiefly upon guesses. But the effect of it\r\nall was, that Laura was considered to be very wealthy and likely to be\r\nvastly more so in a little while. Consequently she was much courted and\r\nas much envied: Her wealth attracted many suitors. Perhaps they came\r\nto worship her riches, but they remained to worship her. Some of the\r\nnoblest men of the time succumbed to her fascinations. She frowned upon\r\nno lover when he made his first advances, but by and by when she was\r\nhopelessly enthralled, he learned from her own lips that she had formed\r\na resolution never to marry. Then he would go away hating and cursing\r\nthe whole sex, and she would calmly add his scalp to her string, while\r\nshe mused upon the bitter day that Col. Selby trampled her love and her\r\npride in the dust. In time it came to be said that her way was paved\r\nwith broken hearts.\r\n\r\nPoor Washington gradually woke up to the fact that he too was an\r\nintellectual marvel as well as his gifted sister. He could not conceive\r\nhow it had come about (it did not occur to him that the gossip about his\r\nfamily's great wealth had any thing to do with it). He could not account\r\nfor it by any process of reasoning, and was simply obliged to accept the\r\nfact and give up trying to solve the riddle. He found himself dragged\r\ninto society and courted, wondered at and envied very much as if he\r\nwere one of those foreign barbers who flit over here now and then with\r\na self-conferred title of nobility and marry some rich fool's absurd\r\ndaughter. Sometimes at a dinner party or a reception he would find\r\nhimself the centre of interest, and feel unutterably uncomfortable in\r\nthe discovery. Being obliged to say something, he would mine his brain\r\nand put in a blast and when the smoke and flying debris had cleared away\r\nthe result would be what seemed to him but a poor little intellectual\r\nclod of dirt or two, and then he would be astonished to see everybody as\r\nlost in admiration as if he had brought up a ton or two of virgin gold.\r\nEvery remark he made delighted his hearers and compelled their applause;\r\nhe overheard people say he was exceedingly bright--they were chiefly\r\nmammas and marriageable young ladies. He found that some of his good\r\nthings were being repeated about the town. Whenever he heard of an\r\ninstance of this kind, he would keep that particular remark in mind and\r\nanalyze it at home in private. At first he could not see that the remark\r\nwas anything better than a parrot might originate; but by and by he\r\nbegan to feel that perhaps he underrated his powers; and after that he\r\nused to analyze his good things with a deal of comfort, and find in\r\nthem a brilliancy which would have been unapparent to him in earlier\r\ndays--and then he would make a note of that good thing and say it again\r\nthe first time he found himself in a new company. Presently he had\r\nsaved up quite a repertoire of brilliancies; and after that he confined\r\nhimself to repeating these and ceased to originate any more, lest he\r\nmight injure his reputation by an unlucky effort.\r\n\r\nHe was constantly having young ladies thrust upon his notice at\r\nreceptions, or left upon his hands at parties, and in time he began to\r\nfeel that he was being deliberately persecuted in this way; and after\r\nthat he could not enjoy society because of his constant dread of these\r\nfemale ambushes and surprises. He was distressed to find that nearly\r\nevery time he showed a young lady a polite attention he was straightway\r\nreported to be engaged to her; and as some of these reports got into the\r\nnewspapers occasionally, he had to keep writing to Louise that they\r\nwere lies and she must believe in him and not mind them or allow them to\r\ngrieve her.\r\n\r\nWashington was as much in the dark as anybody with regard to the great\r\nwealth that was hovering in the air and seemingly on the point of\r\ntumbling into the family pocket. Laura would give him no satisfaction.\r\nAll she would say, was:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait. Be patient. You will see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut will it be soon, Laura?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will not be very long, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what makes you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have reasons--and good ones. Just wait, and be patient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is it going to be as much as people say it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do they say it is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ever so much. Millions!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it will be a great sum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how great, Laura? Will it be millions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you may call it that. Yes, it will be millions. There, now--does\r\nthat satisfy you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSplendid! I can wait. I can wait patiently--ever so patiently. Once I\r\nwas near selling the land for twenty thousand dollars; once for thirty\r\nthousand dollars; once after that for seven thousand dollars; and once\r\nfor forty thousand dollars--but something always told me not to do it.\r\nWhat a fool I would have been to sell it for such a beggarly trifle! It\r\nis the land that's to bring the money, isn't it Laura? You can tell me\r\nthat much, can't you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I don't mind saying that much. It is the land.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut mind--don't ever hint that you got it from me. Don't mention me in\r\nthe matter at all, Washington.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right--I won't. Millions! Isn't it splendid! I mean to look around\r\nfor a building lot; a lot with fine ornamental shrubbery and all\r\nthat sort of thing. I will do it to-day. And I might as well see an\r\narchitect, too, and get him to go to work at a plan for a house. I don't\r\nintend to spare any expense; I mean to have the noblest house that money\r\ncan build.\xe2\x80\x9d Then after a pause--he did not notice Laura's smiles\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaura, would you lay the main hall in encaustic tiles, or just in fancy\r\npatterns of hard wood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura laughed a good old-fashioned laugh that had more of her former\r\nnatural self about it than any sound that had issued from her mouth in\r\nmany weeks. She said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don't change, Washington. You still begin to squander a fortune\r\nright and left the instant you hear of it in the distance; you never\r\nwait till the foremost dollar of it arrives within a hundred miles of\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d --and she kissed her brother good bye and left him weltering in\r\nhis dreams, so to speak.\r\n\r\nHe got up and walked the floor feverishly during two hours; and when he\r\nsat down he had married Louise, built a house, reared a family, married\r\nthem off, spent upwards of eight hundred thousand dollars on mere\r\nluxuries, and died worth twelve millions.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nLaura went down stairs, knocked at/the study door, and entered, scarcely\r\nwaiting for the response. Senator Dilworthy was alone--with an open\r\nBible in his hand, upside down. Laura smiled, and said, forgetting her\r\nacquired correctness of speech,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, come in, sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Senator closed the book and laid it\r\ndown. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to see you. Time to report progress from the committee\r\nof the whole,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Senator beamed with his own congressional wit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the committee of the whole things are working very well. We have\r\nmade ever so much progress in a week. I believe that you and I together\r\ncould run this government beautifully, uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Senator beamed again. He liked to be called \xe2\x80\x9cuncle\xe2\x80\x9d by this\r\nbeautiful woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see Hopperson last night after the congressional prayer\r\nmeeting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. He came. He's a kind of--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh? he is one of my friends, Laura. He's a fine man, a very fine man.\r\nI don't know any man in congress I'd sooner go to for help in any\r\nChristian work. What did he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he beat around a little. He said he should like to help the negro,\r\nhis heart went out to the negro, and all that--plenty of them say\r\nthat but he was a little afraid of the Tennessee Land bill; if Senator\r\nDilworthy wasn't in it, he should suspect there was a fraud on the\r\ngovernment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said that, did he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And he said he felt he couldn't vote for it. He was shy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot shy, child, cautious. He's a very cautious man. I have been with\r\nhim a great deal on conference committees. He wants reasons, good ones.\r\nDidn't you show him he was in error about the bill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did. I went over the whole thing. I had to tell him some of the side\r\narrangements, some of the--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn't mention me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no. I told him you were daft about the negro and the philanthropy\r\npart of it, as you are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDaft is a little strong, Laura. But you know that I wouldn't touch this\r\nbill if it were not for the public good, and for the good of the colored\r\nrace; much as I am interested in the heirs of this property, and would\r\nlike to have them succeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura looked a little incredulous, and the Senator proceeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't misunderstand me, I don't deny that it is for the interest of\r\nall of us that this bill should go through, and it will. I have no\r\nconcealments from you. But I have one principle in my public life, which\r\nI should like you to keep in mind; it has always been my guide. I never\r\npush a private interest if it is not Justified and ennobled by some\r\nlarger public good. I doubt if a Christian would be justified in working\r\nfor his own salvation if it was not to aid in the salvation of his\r\nfellow men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Senator spoke with feeling, and then added,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you showed Hopperson that our motives were pure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and he seemed to have a new light on the measure: I think will\r\nvote for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so; his name will give tone and strength to it. I knew you would\r\nonly have to show him that it was just and pure, in order to secure his\r\ncordial support.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I convinced him. Yes, I am perfectly sure he will vote right\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's good, that's good,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Senator; smiling, and rubbing his\r\nhands. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'll find some changes in that I guess,\xe2\x80\x9d handing the Senator a\r\nprinted list of names. \xe2\x80\x9cThose checked off are all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh--'m--'m,\xe2\x80\x9d running his eye down the list. \xe2\x80\x9cThat's encouraging. What\r\nis the 'C' before some of the names, and the 'B. B.'?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are my private marks. That 'C' stands for 'convinced,' with\r\nargument. The 'B. B.' is a general sign for a relative. You see it\r\nstands before three of the Hon. Committee. I expect to see the chairman\r\nof the committee to-day, Mr. Buckstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, you must, he ought to be seen without any delay. Buckstone is a\r\nworldly sort of a fellow, but he has charitable impulses. If we secure\r\nhim we shall have a favorable report by the committee, and it will be\r\na great thing to be able to state that fact quietly where it will do\r\ngood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I saw Senator Balloon\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will help us, I suppose? Balloon is a whole-hearted fellow. I can't\r\nhelp loving that man, for all his drollery and waggishness. He puts on\r\nan air of levity sometimes, but there aint a man in the senate knows the\r\nscriptures as he does. He did not make any objections?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly, he said--shall I tell you what he said?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Laura\r\nglancing furtively at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said he had no doubt it was a good thing; if Senator Dilworthy was\r\nin it, it would pay to look into it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Senator laughed, but rather feebly, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cBalloon is always\r\nfull of his jokes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI explained it to him. He said it was all right, he only wanted a word\r\nwith you,\xe2\x80\x9d, continued Laura. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a handsome old gentleman, and he is\r\ngallant for an old man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Senator, with a grave look, \xe2\x80\x9cI trust there was\r\nnothing free in his manner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFree?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Laura, with indignation in her face. \xe2\x80\x9cWith me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there, child. I meant nothing, Balloon talks a little freely\r\nsometimes, with men. But he is right at heart. His term expires next\r\nyear and I fear we shall lose him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seemed to be packing the day I was there. His rooms were full of\r\ndry goods boxes, into which his servant was crowding all manner of old\r\nclothes and stuff: I suppose he will paint 'Pub. Docs' on them and frank\r\nthem home. That's good economy, isn't it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, but child, all Congressmen do that. It may not be strictly\r\nhonest, indeed it is not unless he had some public documents mixed in\r\nwith the clothes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's a funny world. Good-bye, uncle. I'm going to see that chairman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd humming a cheery opera air, she departed to her room to dress for\r\ngoing out. Before she did that, however, she took out her note book and\r\nwas soon deep in its contents; marking, dashing, erasing, figuring, and\r\ntalking to herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFree! I wonder what Dilworthy does think of me anyway? One . . . two .\r\n. . eight . . . seventeen . . . twenty-one . . . 'm'm . . . it takes a\r\nheap for a majority. Wouldn't Dilworthy open his eyes if he knew some\r\nof the things Balloon did say to me. There . . . . Hopperson's influence\r\nought to count twenty . . . the sanctimonious old curmudgeon. Son-in-law\r\n. . . sinecure in the negro institution. . . . That about gauges him. .\r\n. . The three committeemen . . . sons-in-law. Nothing like a son-in-law\r\nhere in Washington or a brother-in-law. . . . And everybody has 'em. .\r\n. .Let's see: . . . sixty-one. . . . with places . . . twenty-five . .\r\n. persuaded--it is getting on; . . . . we'll have two-thirds of Congress\r\nin time . . . Dilworthy must surely know I understand him. Uncle\r\nDilworthy . . . . Uncle Balloon!--Tells very amusing stories . . .\r\nwhen ladies are not present . . . I should think so . . . .'m . . . 'm.\r\nEighty-five. There. I must find that chairman. Queer. . . . Buckstone\r\nacts. . . . Seemed to be in love . . . . . I was sure of it. He promised\r\nto come here . . . and he hasn't. . . . Strange. Very strange . . . . I\r\nmust chance to meet him to-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura dressed and went out, thinking she was perhaps too early for Mr.\r\nBuckstone to come from the house, but as he lodged near the bookstore\r\nshe would drop in there and keep a look out for him.\r\n\r\nWhile Laura is on her errand to find Mr. Buckstone, it may not be out\r\nof the way to remark that she knew quite as much of Washington life as\r\nSenator Dilworthy gave her credit for, and more than she thought proper\r\nto tell him. She was acquainted by this time with a good many of the\r\nyoung fellows of Newspaper Row; and exchanged gossip with them to their\r\nmutual advantage.\r\n\r\nThey were always talking in the Row, everlastingly gossiping, bantering\r\nand sarcastically praising things, and going on in a style which was a\r\ncurious commingling of earnest and persiflage. Col. Sellers liked this\r\ntalk amazingly, though he was sometimes a little at sea in it--and\r\nperhaps that didn't lessen the relish of the conversation to the\r\ncorrespondents.\r\n\r\nIt seems that they had got hold of the dry-goods box packing story about\r\nBalloon, one day, and were talking it over when the Colonel came in. The\r\nColonel wanted to know all about it, and Hicks told him. And then Hicks\r\nwent on, with a serious air,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel, if you register a letter, it means that it is of value,\r\ndoesn't it? And if you pay fifteen cents for registering it, the\r\ngovernment will have to take extra care of it and even pay you back its\r\nfull value if it is lost. Isn't that so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I suppose it's so.\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell Senator Balloon put fifteen cents worth of stamps on each of those\r\nseven huge boxes of old clothes, and shipped that ton of second-hand\r\nrubbish, old boots and pantaloons and what not through the mails as\r\nregistered matter! It was an ingenious thing and it had a genuine touch\r\nof humor about it, too. I think there is more real talent among our\r\npublic men of to-day than there was among those of old times--a far more\r\nfertile fancy, a much happier ingenuity. Now, Colonel, can you picture\r\nJefferson, or Washington or John Adams franking their wardrobes through\r\nthe mails and adding the facetious idea of making the government\r\nresponsible for the cargo for the sum of one dollar and five cents?\r\nStatesmen were dull creatures in those days. I have a much greater\r\nadmiration for Senator Balloon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Balloon is a man of parts, there is no denying it\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so. He is spoken of for the post of Minister to China, or\r\nAustria, and I hope will be appointed. What we want abroad is good\r\nexamples of the national character.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJohn Jay and Benjamin Franklin were well enough in their day, but the\r\nnation has made progress since then. Balloon is a man we know and can\r\ndepend on to be true to himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and Balloon has had a good deal of public experience. He is an old\r\nfriend of mine. He was governor of one of the territories a while, and\r\nwas very satisfactory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed he was. He was ex-officio Indian agent, too. Many a man would\r\nhave taken the Indian appropriation and devoted the money to feeding and\r\nclothing the helpless savages, whose land had been taken from them by\r\nthe white man in the interests of civilization; but Balloon knew their\r\nneeds better. He built a government saw-mill on the reservation with the\r\nmoney, and the lumber sold for enormous prices--a relative of his did\r\nall the work free of charge--that is to say he charged nothing more than\r\nthe lumber would bring.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut the poor Injuns--not that I care much for\r\nInjuns--what did he do for them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGave them the outside slabs to fence in the reservation with. Governor\r\nBalloon was nothing less than a father to the poor Indians. But Balloon\r\nis not alone, we have many truly noble statesmen in our country's\r\nservice like Balloon. The Senate is full of them. Don't you think so\r\nColonel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I dunno. I honor my country's public servants as much as any one\r\ncan. I meet them, Sir, every day, and the more I see of them the more I\r\nesteem them and the more grateful I am that our institutions give us the\r\nopportunity of securing their services. Few lands are so blest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true, Colonel. To be sure you can buy now and then a Senator or\r\na Representative but they do not know it is wrong, and so they are not\r\nashamed of it. They are gentle, and confiding and childlike, and in my\r\nopinion these are qualities that ennoble them far more than any amount\r\nof sinful sagacity could. I quite agree with you, Col. Sellers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x9d--hesitated the Colonel--\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid some of them do buy their\r\nseats--yes, I am afraid they do--but as Senator Dilworthy himself said\r\nto me, it is sinful,--it is very wrong--it is shameful; Heaven protect\r\nme from such a charge. That is what Dilworthy said. And yet when you\r\ncome to look at it you cannot deny that we would have to go without the\r\nservices of some of our ablest men, sir, if the country were opposed\r\nto--to--bribery. It is a harsh term. I do not like to use it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel interrupted himself at this point to meet an engagement with\r\nthe Austrian minister, and took his leave with his usual courtly bow.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nIn due time Laura alighted at the book store, and began to look at the\r\ntitles of the handsome array of books on the counter. A dapper clerk\r\nof perhaps nineteen or twenty years, with hair accurately parted and\r\nsurprisingly slick, came bustling up and leaned over with a pretty smile\r\nand an affable--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I--was there any particular book you wished to see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you Taine's England?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeg pardon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTaine's Notes on England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman scratched the side of his nose with a cedar pencil\r\nwhich he took down from its bracket on the side of his head, and\r\nreflected a moment:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh--I see,\xe2\x80\x9d [with a bright smile]--\xe2\x80\x9cTrain, you mean--not Taine. George\r\nFrancis Train. No, ma'm we--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean Taine--if I may take the liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe clerk reflected again--then:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTaine . . . . Taine . . . . Is it hymns?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it isn't hymns. It is a volume that is making a deal of talk just\r\nnow, and is very widely known--except among parties who sell it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe clerk glanced at her face to see if a sarcasm might not lurk\r\nsomewhere in that obscure speech, but the gentle simplicity of the\r\nbeautiful eyes that met his, banished that suspicion. He went away and\r\nconferred with the proprietor. Both appeared to be non-plussed. They\r\nthought and talked, and talked and thought by turns. Then both came\r\nforward and the proprietor said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it an American book, ma'm?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is an American reprint of an English translation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Yes--yes--I remember, now. We are expecting it every day. It isn't\r\nout yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you must be mistaken, because you advertised it a week ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy no--can that be so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am sure of it. And besides, here is the book itself, on the\r\ncounter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe bought it and the proprietor retired from the field. Then she asked\r\nthe clerk for the Autocrat of the Breakfast Table--and was pained to see\r\nthe admiration her beauty had inspired in him fade out of his face. He\r\nsaid with cold dignity, that cook books were somewhat out of their line,\r\nbut he would order it if she desired it. She said, no, never mind.\r\nThen she fell to conning the titles again, finding a delight in the\r\ninspection of the Hawthornes, the Longfellows, the Tennysons, and other\r\nfavorites of her idle hours. Meantime the clerk's eyes were busy, and no\r\ndoubt his admiration was returning again--or may be he was only gauging\r\nher probable literary tastes by some sagacious system of admeasurement\r\nonly known to his guild. Now he began to \xe2\x80\x9cassist\xe2\x80\x9d her in making a\r\nselection; but his efforts met with no success--indeed they only annoyed\r\nher and unpleasantly interrupted her meditations. Presently, while she\r\nwas holding a copy of \xe2\x80\x9cVenetian Life\xe2\x80\x9d in her hand and running over a\r\nfamiliar passage here and there, the clerk said, briskly, snatching up\r\na paper-covered volume and striking the counter a smart blow with it to\r\ndislodge the dust:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow here is a work that we've sold a lot of. Everybody that's read it\r\nlikes it\xe2\x80\x9d--and he intruded it under her nose; \xe2\x80\x9cit's a book that I can\r\nrecommend--'The Pirate's Doom, or the Last of the Buccaneers.' I think\r\nit's one of the best things that's come out this season.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura pushed it gently aside with her hand and went on and went on\r\nfilching from \xe2\x80\x9cVenetian Life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I do not want it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThe clerk hunted around awhile, glancing at one title and then another,\r\nbut apparently not finding what he wanted.\r\n\r\nHowever, he succeeded at last. Said he:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever read this, ma'm? I am sure you'll like it. It's by the\r\nauthor of 'The Hooligans of Hackensack.' It is full of love troubles and\r\nmysteries and all sorts of such things. The heroine strangles her own\r\nmother. Just glance at the title please,--'Gonderil the Vampire, or The\r\nDance of Death.' And here is 'The Jokist's Own Treasury, or, The Phunny\r\nPhellow's Bosom Phriend.' The funniest thing!--I've read it four times,\r\nma'm, and I can laugh at the very sight of it yet. And 'Gonderil,'--I\r\nassure you it is the most splendid book I ever read. I know you will\r\nlike these books, ma'm, because I've read them myself and I know what\r\nthey are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I was perplexed--but I see how it is, now. You must have thought\r\nI asked you to tell me what sort of books I wanted--for I am apt to say\r\nthings which I don't really mean, when I am absent minded. I suppose I\r\ndid ask you, didn't I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo ma'm,--but I--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I must have done it, else you would not have offered your\r\nservices, for fear it might be rude. But don't be troubled--it was all\r\nmy fault. I ought not to have been so heedless--I ought not to have\r\nasked you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you didn't ask me, ma'm. We always help customers all we can. You\r\nsee our experience--living right among books all the time--that sort of\r\nthing makes us able to help a customer make a selection, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow does it, indeed? It is part of your business, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes'm, we always help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow good it is of you. Some people would think it rather obtrusive,\r\nperhaps, but I don't--I think it is real kindness--even charity. Some\r\npeople jump to conclusions without any thought--you have noticed that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk, a little perplexed as to whether to feel\r\ncomfortable or the reverse; \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, indeed, I've often noticed that,\r\nma'm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they jump to conclusions with an absurd heedlessness. Now some\r\npeople would think it odd that because you, with the budding tastes\r\nand the innocent enthusiasms natural to your time of life, enjoyed the\r\nVampires and the volume of nursery jokes, you should imagine that an\r\nolder person would delight in them too--but I do not think it odd at\r\nall. I think it natural--perfectly natural in you. And kind, too. You\r\nlook like a person who not only finds a deep pleasure in any little\r\nthing in the way of literature that strikes you forcibly, but is willing\r\nand glad to share that pleasure with others--and that, I think, is noble\r\nand admirable--very noble and admirable. I think we ought all to share\r\nour pleasures with others, and do what we can to make each other happy,\r\ndo not you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes. Oh, yes, indeed. Yes, you are quite right, ma'm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he was getting unmistakably uncomfortable, now, notwithstanding\r\nLaura's confiding sociability and almost affectionate tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed. Many people would think that what a bookseller--or perhaps\r\nhis clerk--knows about literature as literature, in contradistinction to\r\nits character as merchandise, would hardly, be of much assistance to a\r\nperson--that is, to an adult, of course--in the selection of food for\r\nthe mind--except of course wrapping paper, or twine, or wafers, or\r\nsomething like that--but I never feel that way. I feel that whatever\r\nservice you offer me, you offer with a good heart, and I am as grateful\r\nfor it as if it were the greatest boon to me. And it is useful to me--it\r\nis bound to be so. It cannot be otherwise. If you show me a book which\r\nyou have read--not skimmed over or merely glanced at, but read--and you\r\ntell me that you enjoyed it and that you could read it three or four\r\ntimes, then I know what book I want--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you!--th--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n--\xe2\x80\x9cto avoid. Yes indeed. I think that no information ever comes amiss\r\nin this world. Once or twice I have traveled in the cars--and there you\r\nknow, the peanut boy always measures you with his eye, and hands you out\r\na book of murders if you are fond of theology; or Tupper or a dictionary\r\nor T. S. Arthur if you are fond of poetry; or he hands you a volume\r\nof distressing jokes or a copy of the American Miscellany if you\r\nparticularly dislike that sort of literary fatty degeneration of the\r\nheart--just for the world like a pleasant spoken well-meaning gentleman\r\nin any bookstore. But here I am running on as if business men had\r\nnothing to do but listen to women talk. You must pardon me, for I was\r\nnot thinking.--And you must let me thank you again for helping me. I\r\nread a good deal, and shall be in nearly every day and I would be sorry\r\nto have you think me a customer who talks too much and buys too little.\r\nMight I ask you to give me the time? Ah-two-twenty-two. Thank you very\r\nmuch. I will set mine while I have the opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she could not get her watch open, apparently. She tried, and tried\r\nagain. Then the clerk, trembling at his own audacity, begged to be\r\nallowed to assist. She allowed him. He succeeded, and was radiant under\r\nthe sweet influences of her pleased face and her seductively worded\r\nacknowledgements with gratification. Then he gave her the exact time\r\nagain, and anxiously watched her turn the hands slowly till they reached\r\nthe precise spot without accident or loss of life, and then he looked\r\nas happy as a man who had helped a fellow being through a momentous\r\nundertaking, and was grateful to know that he had not lived in vain.\r\nLaura thanked him once more. The words were music to his ear; but what\r\nwere they compared to the ravishing smile with which she flooded his\r\nwhole system? When she bowed her adieu and turned away, he was no longer\r\nsuffering torture in the pillory where she had had him trussed up\r\nduring so many distressing moments, but he belonged to the list of her\r\nconquests and was a flattered and happy thrall, with the dawn-light of\r\nlove breaking over the eastern elevations of his heart.\r\n\r\nIt was about the hour, now, for the chairman of the House Committee on\r\nBenevolent Appropriations to make his appearance, and Laura stepped to\r\nthe door to reconnoiter. She glanced up the street, and sure enough--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 5.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII Representative Buckstone and Laura's Strategic Coquetry\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII Reception Day in Washington--Laura Again Meets Col.\r\nSelby and the Effect Upon Her\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX Col.

Such disappointments seldom occur in\r\nnovels, but are always happening in real life.\r\n\r\nShe was obliged to make a new plan. She sent him a note, and asked him\r\nto call in the evening--which he did.\r\n\r\nShe received the Hon. Mr. Buckstone with a sunny smile, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know how I ever dared to send you a note, Mr. Buckstone, for\r\nyou have the reputation of not being very partial to our sex.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy I am sure my reputation does me wrong, then, Miss Hawkins. I have\r\nbeen married once--is that nothing in my favor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes--that is, it may be and it may not be. If you have known what\r\nperfection is in woman, it is fair to argue that inferiority cannot\r\ninterest you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven if that were the case it could not affect you, Miss Hawkins,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe chairman gallantly. \xe2\x80\x9cFame does not place you in the list of ladies\r\nwho rank below perfection.\xe2\x80\x9d This happy speech delighted Mr. Buckstone as\r\nmuch as it seemed to delight Laura. But it did not confuse him as much\r\nas it apparently did her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish in all sincerity that I could be worthy of such a felicitous\r\ncompliment as that. But I am a woman, and so I am gratified for it just\r\nas it is, and would not have it altered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is not merely a compliment--that is, an empty complement--it is\r\nthe truth. All men will endorse that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura looked pleased, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very kind of you to say it. It is a distinction indeed, for a\r\ncountry-bred girl like me to be so spoken of by people of brains and\r\nculture. You are so kind that I know you will pardon my putting you to\r\nthe trouble to come this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed it was no trouble. It was a pleasure. I am alone in the world\r\nsince I lost my wife, and I often long for the society of your sex, Miss\r\nHawkins, notwithstanding what people may say to the contrary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is pleasant to hear you say that. I am sure it must be so. If I\r\nfeel lonely at times, because of my exile from old friends, although\r\nsurrounded by new ones who are already very dear to me, how much more\r\nlonely must you feel, bereft as you are, and with no wholesome relief\r\nfrom the cares of state that weigh you down. For your own sake, as\r\nwell as for the sake of others, you ought to go into society oftener. I\r\nseldom see you at a reception, and when I do you do not usually give me\r\nvery much of your attention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never imagined that you wished it or I would have been very glad to\r\nmake myself happy in that way.--But one seldom gets an opportunity to\r\nsay more than a sentence to you in a place like that. You are always the\r\ncentre of a group--a fact which you may have noticed yourself. But if\r\none might come here--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed you would always find a hearty welcome, Mr. Buckstone. I\r\nhave often wished you would come and tell me more about Cairo and the\r\nPyramids, as you once promised me you would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, do you remember that yet, Miss Hawkins? I thought ladies' memories\r\nwere more fickle than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they are not so fickle as gentlemen's promises. And besides, if I\r\nhad been inclined to forget, I--did you not give me something by way of\r\na remembrancer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does seem to me that I did; but I have forgotten what it was now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, never call a lady's memory fickle again! Do you recognize this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little spray of box! I am beaten--I surrender. But have you kept that\r\nall this time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura's confusion was very pretty. She tried to hide it, but the more\r\nshe tried the more manifest it became and withal the more captivating to\r\nlook upon. Presently she threw the spray of box from her with an annoyed\r\nair, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgot myself. I have been very foolish. I beg that you will forget\r\nthis absurd thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Buckstone picked up the spray, and sitting down by Laura's side on\r\nthe sofa, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease let me keep it, Miss Hawkins. I set a very high value upon it\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it to me, Mr. Buckstone, and do not speak so. I have been\r\nsufficiently punished for my thoughtlessness. You cannot take pleasure\r\nin adding to my distress. Please give it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I do not wish to distress you. But do not consider the matter so\r\ngravely; you have done yourself no wrong. You probably forgot that you\r\nhad it; but if you had given it to me I would have kept it--and not\r\nforgotten it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not talk so, Mr. Buckstone. Give it to me, please, and forget the\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would not be kind to refuse, since it troubles you so, and so I\r\nrestore it. But if you would give me part of it and keep the rest--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that you might have something to remind you of me when you wished to\r\nlaugh at my foolishness?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, by no means, no! Simply that I might remember that I had once\r\nassisted to discomfort you, and be reminded to do so no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura looked up, and scanned his face a moment. She was about to break\r\nthe twig, but she hesitated and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were sure that you--\xe2\x80\x9d She threw the spray away, and continued:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is silly! We will change the subject. No, do not insist--I must\r\nhave my way in this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Buckstone drew off his forces and proceeded to make a wily\r\nadvance upon the fortress under cover of carefully-contrived artifices\r\nand stratagems of war. But he contended with an alert and suspicious\r\nenemy; and so at the end of two hours it was manifest to him that he had\r\nmade but little progress. Still, he had made some; he was sure of that.\r\n\r\nLaura sat alone and communed with herself;\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is fairly hooked, poor thing. I can play him at my leisure and land\r\nhim when I choose. He was all ready to be caught, days and days ago--I\r\nsaw that, very well. He will vote for our bill--no fear about that; and\r\nmoreover he will work for it, too, before I am done with him. If he had\r\na woman's eyes he would have noticed that the spray of box had grown\r\nthree inches since he first gave it to me, but a man never sees anything\r\nand never suspects. If I had shown him a whole bush he would have\r\nthought it was the same. Well, it is a good night's work: the committee\r\nis safe. But this is a desperate game I am playing in these days--a\r\nwearing, sordid, heartless game. If I lose, I lose everything--even\r\nmyself. And if I win the game, will it be worth its cost after all? I do\r\nnot know. Sometimes I doubt. Sometimes I half wish I had not begun.\r\nBut no matter; I have begun, and I will never turn back; never while I\r\nlive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Buckstone indulged in a reverie as he walked homeward:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is shrewd and deep, and plays her cards with considerable\r\ndiscretion--but she will lose, for all that. There is no hurry; I shall\r\ncome out winner, all in good time. She is the most beautiful woman in\r\nthe world; and she surpassed herself to-night. I suppose I must vote\r\nfor that bill, in the end maybe; but that is not a matter of much\r\nconsequence the government can stand it. She is bent on capturing me,\r\nthat is plain; but she will find by and by that what she took for a\r\nsleeping garrison was an ambuscade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n     Now this surprising news caus'd her fall in 'a trance,\r\n     Life as she were dead, no limbs she could advance,\r\n     Then her dear brother came, her from the ground he took\r\n     And she spake up and said, O my poor heart is broke.\r\n\r\n     \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Barnardcastle Tragedy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't you think he is distinguished looking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! That gawky looking person, with Miss Hawkins?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere. He's just speaking to Mrs. Schoonmaker. Such high-bred\r\nnegligence and unconsciousness. Nothing studied. See his fine eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery. They are moving this way now. Maybe he is coming here. But he\r\nlooks as helpless as a rag baby. Who is he, Blanche?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is he? And you've been here a week, Grace, and don't know? He's the\r\ncatch of the season. That's Washington Hawkins--her brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery old family, old Kentucky family I believe. He's got enormous\r\nlanded property in Tennessee, I think. The family lost everything,\r\nslaves and that sort of thing, you know, in the war. But they have a\r\ngreat deal of land, minerals, mines and all that. Mr. Hawkins and his\r\nsister too are very much interested in the amelioration of the condition\r\nof the colored race; they have some plan, with Senator Dilworthy, to\r\nconvert a large part of their property to something another for the\r\nfreedmen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don't say so? I thought he was some guy from Pennsylvania. But\r\nhe is different from others. Probably he has lived all his life on his\r\nplantation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a day reception of Mrs. Representative Schoonmaker, a sweet\r\nwoman, of simple and sincere manners. Her house was one of the most\r\npopular in Washington. There was less ostentation there than in some\r\nothers, and people liked to go where the atmosphere reminded them of the\r\npeace and purity of home. Mrs. Schoonmaker was as natural and unaffected\r\nin Washington society as she was in her own New York house, and kept up\r\nthe spirit of home-life there, with her husband and children. And that\r\nwas the reason, probably, why people of refinement liked to go there.\r\n\r\nWashington is a microcosm, and one can suit himself with any sort of\r\nsociety within a radius of a mile. To a large portion of the people who\r\nfrequent Washington or dwell there, the ultra fashion, the shoddy, the\r\njobbery are as utterly distasteful as they would be in a refined New\r\nEngland City. Schoonmaker was not exactly a leader in the House, but he\r\nwas greatly respected for his fine talents and his honesty. No one would\r\nhave thought of offering to carry National Improvement Directors Relief\r\nstock for him.\r\n\r\nThese day receptions were attended by more women than men, and those\r\ninterested in the problem might have studied the costumes of the ladies\r\npresent, in view of this fact, to discover whether women dress more\r\nfor the eyes of women or for effect upon men. It is a very important\r\nproblem, and has been a good deal discussed, and its solution would\r\nform one fixed, philosophical basis, upon which to estimate woman's\r\ncharacter. We are inclined to take a medium ground, and aver that woman\r\ndresses to please herself, and in obedience to a law of her own nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are coming this way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche. People who made way for them\r\nto pass, turned to look at them. Washington began to feel that the eyes\r\nof the public were on him also, and his eyes rolled about, now towards\r\nthe ceiling, now towards the floor, in an effort to look unconscious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Miss Hawkins. Delighted. Mr. Hawkins. My friend, Miss\r\nMedlar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Hawkins, who was endeavoring to square himself for a bow, put his\r\nfoot through the train of Mrs. Senator Poplin, who looked round with a\r\nscowl, which turned into a smile as she saw who it was. In extricating\r\nhimself, Mr. Hawkins, who had the care of his hat as well as the\r\nintroduction on his mind, shambled against Miss Blanche, who said\r\npardon, with the prettiest accent, as if the awkwardness were her own.\r\nAnd Mr. Hawkins righted himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't you find it very warm to-day, Mr. Hawkins?\xe2\x80\x9d said Blanche, by way\r\nof a remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's awful hot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Washington.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's warm for the season,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Blanche pleasantly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I suppose\r\nyou are accustomed to it,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with a general idea that the\r\nthermometer always stands at 90 deg. in all parts of the late slave\r\nstates. \xe2\x80\x9cWashington weather generally cannot be very congenial to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's congenial,\xe2\x80\x9d said Washington brightening up, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it's not\r\ncongealed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's very good. Did you hear, Grace, Mr. Hawkins says it's congenial\r\nwhen it's not congealed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d said Grace, who was talking with Laura.\r\n\r\nThe conversation was now finely under way. Washington launched out an\r\nobservation of his own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you see those Japs, Miss Leavitt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, aren't they queer. But so high-bred, so picturesque. Do you\r\nthink that color makes any difference, Mr. Hawkins? I used to be so\r\nprejudiced against color.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you? I never was. I used to think my old mammy was handsome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow interesting your life must have been! I should like to hear about\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington was about settling himself into his narrative style, when\r\nMrs. Gen. McFingal caught his eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been at the Capitol to-day, Mr. Hawkins?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington had not. \xe2\x80\x9cIs anything uncommon going on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey say it was very exciting. The Alabama business you know. Gen.\r\nSutler, of Massachusetts, defied England, and they say he wants war.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wants to make himself conspicuous more like,\xe2\x80\x9d said Laura. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\nalways, you have noticed, talks with one eye on the gallery, while the\r\nother is on the speaker.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my husband says, its nonsense to talk of war, and wicked. He\r\nknows what war is. If we do have war, I hope it will be for the patriots\r\nof Cuba. Don't you think we want Cuba, Mr. Hawkins?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we want it bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Washington. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Santo Domingo. Senator\r\nDilworthy says, we are bound to extend our religion over the isles of\r\nthe sea. We've got to round out our territory, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington's further observations were broken off by Laura, who whisked\r\nhim off to another part of the room, and reminded him that they must\r\nmake their adieux.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow stupid and tiresome these people are,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet's go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were turning to say good-by to the hostess, when Laura's attention\r\nwas arrested by the sight of a gentleman who was just speaking to Mrs.\r\nSchoonmaker. For a second her heart stopped beating. He was a handsome\r\nman of forty and perhaps more, with grayish hair and whiskers, and he\r\nwalked with a cane, as if he were slightly lame. He might be less than\r\nforty, for his face was worn into hard lines, and he was pale.\r\n\r\nNo. It could not be, she said to herself. It is only a resemblance. But\r\nas the gentleman turned and she saw his full face, Laura put out her\r\nhand and clutched Washington's arm to prevent herself from falling.\r\n\r\nWashington, who was not minding anything, as usual, looked 'round in\r\nwonder. Laura's eyes were blazing fire and hatred; he had never seen her\r\nlook so before; and her face, was livid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what is it, sis? Your face is as white as paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's he, it's he. Come, come,\xe2\x80\x9d and she dragged him away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's who?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Washington, when they had gained the carriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's nobody, it's nothing. Did I say he? I was faint with the heat.\r\nDon't mention it. Don't you speak of it,\xe2\x80\x9d she added earnestly, grasping\r\nhis arm.\r\n\r\nWhen she had gained her room she went to the glass and saw a pallid and\r\nhaggard face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthis will never do. I should have killed him, if\r\nI could. The scoundrel still lives, and dares to come here. I ought to\r\nkill him. He has no right to live. How I hate him. And yet I loved him.\r\nOh heavens, how I did love that man. And why didn't he kill me? He\r\nmight better. He did kill all that was good in me. Oh, but he shall not\r\nescape. He shall not escape this time. He may have forgotten. He will\r\nfind that a woman's hate doesn't forget. The law? What would the law do\r\nbut protect him and make me an outcast? How all Washington would gather\r\nup its virtuous skirts and avoid me, if it knew. I wonder if he hates me\r\nas I do him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Laura raved, in tears and in rage by turns, tossed in a tumult of\r\npassion, which she gave way to with little effort to control.\r\n\r\nA servant came to summon her to dinner. She had a headache. The hour\r\ncame for the President's reception. She had a raving headache, and the\r\nSenator must go without her.\r\n\r\nThat night of agony was like another night she recalled. How vividly it\r\nall came back to her. And at that time she remembered she thought she\r\nmight be mistaken. He might come back to her. Perhaps he loved her,\r\na little, after all. Now, she knew he did not. Now, she knew he was a\r\ncold-blooded scoundrel, without pity. Never a word in all these years.\r\nShe had hoped he was dead. Did his wife live, she wondered. She caught\r\nat that--and it gave a new current to her thoughts. Perhaps, after\r\nall--she must see him. She could not live without seeing him. Would he\r\nsmile as in the old days when she loved him so; or would he sneer as\r\nwhen she last saw him? If he looked so, she hated him. If he should call\r\nher \xe2\x80\x9cLaura, darling,\xe2\x80\x9d and look SO! She must find him. She must end her\r\ndoubts.\r\n\r\nLaura kept her room for two days, on one excuse and another--a nervous\r\nheadache, a cold--to the great anxiety of the Senator's household.\r\nCallers, who went away, said she had been too gay--they did not say\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfast,\xe2\x80\x9d though some of them may have thought it. One so conspicuous and\r\nsuccessful in society as Laura could not be out of the way two days,\r\nwithout remarks being made, and not all of them complimentary.\r\n\r\nWhen she came down she appeared as usual, a little pale may be, but\r\nunchanged in manner. If there were any deepened lines about the eyes\r\nthey had been concealed. Her course of action was quite determined.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast she asked if any one had heard any unusual noise during the\r\nnight? Nobody had. Washington never heard any noise of any kind after\r\nhis eyes were shut. Some people thought he never did when they were open\r\neither.\r\n\r\nSenator Dilworthy said he had come in late. He was detained in a little\r\nconsultation after the Congressional prayer meeting. Perhaps it was his\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\nNo, Laura said. She heard that. It was later. She might have been\r\nnervous, but she fancied somebody was trying to get into the house.\r\n\r\nMr. Brierly humorously suggested that it might be, as none of the\r\nmembers were occupied in night session.\r\n\r\nThe Senator frowned, and said he did not like to hear that kind of\r\nnewspaper slang. There might be burglars about.\r\n\r\nLaura said that very likely it was only her nervousness. But she\r\nthought she would feel safer if Washington would let her take one of his\r\npistols. Washington brought her one of his revolvers, and instructed her\r\nin the art of loading and firing it.\r\n\r\nDuring the morning Laura drove down to Mrs. Schoonmaker's to pay a\r\nfriendly call.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour receptions are always delightful,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to that lady, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\npleasant people all seem to come here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's pleasant to hear you say so, Miss Hawkins. I believe my friends\r\nlike to come here. Though society in Washington is mixed; we have a\r\nlittle of everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose, though, you don't see much of the old rebel element?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nLaura with a smile.\r\n\r\nIf this seemed to Mrs. Schoonmaker a singular remark for a lady to make,\r\nwho was meeting \xe2\x80\x9crebels\xe2\x80\x9d in society every day, she did not express it in\r\nany way, but only said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know we don't say 'rebel' anymore. Before we came to Washington I\r\nthought rebels would look unlike other people. I find we are very much\r\nalike, and that kindness and good nature wear away prejudice. And then\r\nyou know there are all sorts of common interests. My husband sometimes\r\nsays that he doesn't see but confederates are just as eager to get\r\nat the treasury as Unionists. You know that Mr. Schoonmaker is on the\r\nappropriations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he know many Southerners?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes. There were several at my reception the other day. Among others\r\na confederate Colonel--a stranger--handsome man with gray hair, probably\r\nyou didn't notice him, uses a cane in walking. A very agreeable man. I\r\nwondered why he called. When my husband came home and looked over the\r\ncards, he said he had a cotton claim. A real southerner. Perhaps\r\nyou might know him if I could think of his name. Yes, here's his\r\ncard--Louisiana.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura took the card, looked at it intently till she was sure of the\r\naddress, and then laid it down, with,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he is no friend of ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, Laura wrote and dispatched the following note. It was in\r\na round hand, unlike her flowing style, and it was directed to a number\r\nand street in Georgetown:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Lady at Senator Dilworthy's would like to see Col. George Selby,\r\non business connected with the Cotton Claims. Can he call Wednesday at\r\nthree o'clock P. M.?\xe2\x80\x9d On Wednesday at 3 P. M, no one of the family was\r\nlikely to be in the house except Laura.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nCol. Selby had just come to Washington, and taken lodgings in\r\nGeorgetown. His business was to get pay for some cotton that was\r\ndestroyed during the war. There were many others in Washington on the\r\nsame errand, some of them with claims as difficult to establish as his.\r\nA concert of action was necessary, and he was not, therefore, at all\r\nsurprised to receive the note from a lady asking him to call at Senator\r\nDilworthy's.\r\n\r\nAt a little after three on Wednesday he rang the bell of the Senator's\r\nresidence. It was a handsome mansion on the Square opposite the\r\nPresident's house. The owner must be a man of great wealth, the Colonel\r\nthought; perhaps, who knows, said he with a smile, he may have got some\r\nof my cotton in exchange for salt and quinine after the capture of New\r\nOrleans. As this thought passed through his mind he was looking at the\r\nremarkable figure of the Hero of New Orleans, holding itself by main\r\nstrength from sliding off the back of the rearing bronze horse, and\r\nlifting its hat in the manner of one who acknowledges the playing of\r\nthat martial air: \xe2\x80\x9cSee, the Conquering Hero Comes!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nColonel to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cOld Hickory ought to get down and give his seat to\r\nGen. Sutler--but they'd have to tie him on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura was in the drawing room. She heard the bell, she heard the steps\r\nin the hall, and the emphatic thud of the supporting cane. She had risen\r\nfrom her chair and was leaning against the piano, pressing her left\r\nhand against the violent beating of her heart. The door opened and the\r\nColonel entered, standing in the full light of the opposite window.\r\nLaura was more in the shadow and stood for an instant, long enough for\r\nthe Colonel to make the inward observation that she was a magnificent\r\nWoman. She then advanced a step.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCol. Selby, is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel staggered back, caught himself by a chair, and turned\r\ntowards her a look of terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaura? My God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, your wife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, it can't be. How came you here? I thought you were--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou thought I was dead? You thought you were rid of me? Not so long as\r\nyou live, Col. Selby, not so long as you live,\xe2\x80\x9d Laura in her passion was\r\nhurried on to say.\r\n\r\nNo man had ever accused Col. Selby of cowardice. But he was a coward\r\nbefore this woman. May be he was not the man he once was. Where was his\r\ncoolness? Where was his sneering, imperturbable manner, with which he\r\ncould have met, and would have met, any woman he had wronged, if he had\r\nonly been forewarned. He felt now that he must temporize, that he\r\nmust gain time. There was danger in Laura's tone. There was something\r\nfrightful in her calmness. Her steady eyes seemed to devour him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have ruined my life,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cand I was so young, so ignorant,\r\nand loved you so. You betrayed me, and left me, mocking me and trampling\r\nme into the dust, a soiled cast-off. You might better have killed me\r\nthen. Then I should not have hated you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaura,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel, nerving himself, but still pale, and speaking\r\nappealingly, \xe2\x80\x9cdon't say that. Reproach me. I deserve it. I was a\r\nscoundrel. I was everything monstrous. But your beauty made me crazy.\r\nYou are right. I was a brute in leaving you as I did. But what could I\r\ndo? I was married, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your wife still lives?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Laura, bending a little forward in\r\nher eagerness.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel noticed the action, and he almost said \xe2\x80\x9cno,\xe2\x80\x9d but he thought\r\nof the folly of attempting concealment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. She is here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat little color had wandered back into Laura's face forsook it again.\r\nHer heart stood still, her strength seemed going from her limbs. Her\r\nlast hope was gone. The room swam before her for a moment, and the\r\nColonel stepped towards her, but she waved him back, as hot anger again\r\ncoursed through her veins, and said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you dare come with her, here, and tell me of it, here and mock me\r\nwith it! And you think I will have it; George? You think I will let you\r\nlive with that woman? You think I am as powerless as that day I fell\r\ndead at your feet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raged now. She was in a tempest of excitement. And she advanced\r\ntowards him with a threatening mien. She would kill me if she could,\r\nthought the Colonel; but he thought at the same moment, how beautiful\r\nshe is. He had recovered his head now. She was lovely when he knew her,\r\nthen a simple country girl. Now she was dazzling, in the fullness of\r\nripe womanhood, a superb creature, with all the fascination that a woman\r\nof the world has for such a man as Col. Selby. Nothing of this was lost\r\non him. He stepped quickly to her, grasped both her hands in his, and\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaura, stop! think! Suppose I loved you yet! Suppose I hated my fate!\r\nWhat can I do? I am broken by the war. I have lost everything almost. I\r\nhad as lief be dead and done with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel spoke with a low remembered voice that thrilled through\r\nLaura. He was looking into her eyes as he had looked in those old days,\r\nwhen no birds of all those that sang in the groves where they walked\r\nsang a note of warning. He was wounded. He had been punished. Her\r\nstrength forsook her with her rage, and she sank upon a chair, sobbing,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! my God, I thought I hated him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel knelt beside her. He took her hand and she let him keep it.\r\nShe looked down into his face, with a pitiable tenderness, and said in a\r\nweak voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you do love me a little?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel vowed and protested. He kissed her hand and her lips. He\r\nswore his false soul into perdition.\r\n\r\nShe wanted love, this woman. Was not her love for George Selby deeper\r\nthan any other woman's could be? Had she not a right to him? Did he not\r\nbelong to her by virtue of her overmastering passion? His wife--she was\r\nnot his wife, except by the law. She could not be. Even with the law she\r\ncould have no right to stand between two souls that were one. It was an\r\ninfamous condition in society that George should be tied to her.\r\n\r\nLaura thought this, believed it; because she desired to believe it. She\r\ncame to it as an original proposition founded on the requirements of her\r\nown nature. She may have heard, doubtless she had, similar theories that\r\nwere prevalent at that day, theories of the tyranny of marriage and of\r\nthe freedom of marriage. She had even heard women lecturers say, that\r\nmarriage should only continue so long as it pleased either party to\r\nit--for a year, or a month, or a day. She had not given much heed to\r\nthis, but she saw its justice now in a dash of revealing desire. It must\r\nbe right. God would not have permitted her to love George Selby as she\r\ndid, and him to love her, if it was right for society to raise up\r\na barrier between them. He belonged to her. Had he not confessed it\r\nhimself?\r\n\r\nNot even the religious atmosphere of Senator Dilworthy's house had been\r\nsufficient to instill into Laura that deep Christian principle which had\r\nbeen somehow omitted in her training. Indeed in that very house had she\r\nnot heard women, prominent before the country and besieging Congress,\r\nutter sentiments that fully justified the course she was marking out for\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThey were seated now, side by side, talking with more calmness.\r\nLaura was happy, or thought she was. But it was that feverish sort of\r\nhappiness which is snatched out of the black shadow of falsehood, and\r\nis at the moment recognized as fleeting and perilous, and indulged\r\ntremblingly. She loved. She was loved. That is happiness certainly. And\r\nthe black past and the troubled present and the uncertain future could\r\nnot snatch that from her.\r\n\r\nWhat did they say as they sat there? What nothings do people usually\r\nsay in such circumstances, even if they are three-score and ten? It was\r\nenough for Laura to hear his voice and be near him. It was enough for\r\nhim to be near her, and avoid committing himself as much as he could.\r\nEnough for him was the present also. Had there not always been some way\r\nout of such scrapes?\r\n\r\nAnd yet Laura could not be quite content without prying into tomorrow.\r\nHow could the Colonel manage to free himself from his wife? Would it be\r\nlong? Could he not go into some State where it would not take much time?\r\nHe could not say exactly. That they must think of. That they must talk\r\nover. And so on. Did this seem like a damnable plot to Laura against\r\nthe life, maybe, of a sister, a woman like herself? Probably not. It was\r\nright that this man should be hers, and there were some obstacles in the\r\nway. That was all. There are as good reasons for bad actions as for\r\ngood ones,--to those who commit them. When one has broken the tenth\r\ncommandment, the others are not of much account.\r\n\r\nWas it unnatural, therefore, that when George Selby departed, Laura\r\nshould watch him from the window, with an almost joyful heart as he went\r\ndown the sunny square? \xe2\x80\x9cI shall see him to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand the\r\nnext day, and the next. He is mine now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDamn the woman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel as he picked his way down the steps.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, as his thoughts took a new turn, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish my wife was in\r\nNew Orleans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\n     Open your ears; for which of you will stop,\r\n     The vent of hearing when loud Rumor speaks?\r\n     I, from the orient to the drooping west,\r\n     Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold\r\n     The acts commenced on this ball of earth:\r\n     Upon my tongues continual slanders ride;\r\n     The which in every language I pronounce,\r\n     Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.\r\n\r\n     King Henry IV.\r\n\r\nAs may be readily believed, Col. Beriah Sellers was by this time one\r\nof the best known men in Washington. For the first time in his life his\r\ntalents had a fair field.\r\n\r\nHe was now at the centre of the manufacture of gigantic schemes,\r\nof speculations of all sorts, of political and social gossip. The\r\natmosphere was full of little and big rumors and of vast, undefined\r\nexpectations. Everybody was in haste, too, to push on his private plan,\r\nand feverish in his haste, as if in constant apprehension that tomorrow\r\nwould be Judgment Day. Work while Congress is in session, said the\r\nuneasy spirit, for in the recess there is no work and no device.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel enjoyed this bustle and confusion amazingly; he thrived in\r\nthe air of indefinite expectation. All his own schemes took larger shape\r\nand more misty and majestic proportions; and in this congenial air,\r\nthe Colonel seemed even to himself to expand into something large and\r\nmysterious. If he respected himself before, he almost worshipped Beriah\r\nSellers now, as a superior being. If he could have chosen an official\r\nposition out of the highest, he would have been embarrassed in the\r\nselection. The presidency of the republic seemed too limited and cramped\r\nin the constitutional restrictions. If he could have been Grand Llama\r\nof the United States, that might have come the nearest to his idea of a\r\nposition. And next to that he would have luxuriated in the irresponsible\r\nomniscience of the Special Correspondent.\r\n\r\nCol. Sellers knew the President very well, and had access to\r\nhis presence when officials were kept cooling their heels in the\r\nWaiting-room. The President liked to hear the Colonel talk, his voluble\r\nease was a refreshment after the decorous dullness of men who only\r\ntalked business and government, and everlastingly expounded their\r\nnotions of justice and the distribution of patronage. The Colonel was as\r\nmuch a lover of farming and of horses as Thomas Jefferson was. He\r\ntalked to the President by the hour about his magnificent stud, and his\r\nplantation at Hawkeye, a kind of principality--he represented it. He\r\nurged the President to pay him a visit during the recess, and see his\r\nstock farm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe President's table is well enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he used to say, to the loafers\r\nwho gathered about him at Willard's, \xe2\x80\x9cwell enough for a man on a salary,\r\nbut God bless my soul, I should like him to see a little old-fashioned\r\nhospitality--open house, you know. A person seeing me at home might\r\nthink I paid no attention to what was in the house, just let things\r\nflow in and out. He'd be mistaken. What I look to is quality, sir. The\r\nPresident has variety enough, but the quality! Vegetables of course\r\nyou can't expect here. I'm very particular about mine. Take celery,\r\nnow--there's only one spot in this country where celery will grow. But\r\nI am surprised about the wines. I should think they were manufactured\r\nin the New York Custom House. I must send the President some from my\r\ncellar. I was really mortified the other day at dinner to see Blacque\r\nBey leave his standing in the glasses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the Colonel first came to Washington he had thoughts of taking the\r\nmission to Constantinople, in order to be on the spot to look after the\r\ndissemination of his Eye Water, but as that invention; was not yet quite\r\nready, the project shrank a little in the presence of vaster schemes.\r\nBesides he felt that he could do the country more good by remaining\r\nat home. He was one of the Southerners who were constantly quoted as\r\nheartily \xe2\x80\x9caccepting the situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm whipped,\xe2\x80\x9d he used to say with a jolly laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cthe government was\r\ntoo many for me; I'm cleaned out, done for, except my plantation and\r\nprivate mansion. We played for a big thing, and lost it, and I don't\r\nwhine, for one. I go for putting the old flag on all the vacant lots. I\r\nsaid to the President, says I, 'Grant, why don't you take Santo Domingo,\r\nannex the whole thing, and settle the bill afterwards. That's my way.\r\nI'd take the job to manage Congress. The South would come into it.\r\nYou've got to conciliate the South, consolidate the two debts, pay 'em\r\noff in greenbacks, and go ahead. That's my notion. Boutwell's got the\r\nright notion about the value of paper, but he lacks courage. I should\r\nlike to run the treasury department about six months. I'd make things\r\nplenty, and business look up.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel had access to the departments. He knew all the senators and\r\nrepresentatives, and especially, the lobby. He was consequently a great\r\nfavorite in Newspaper Row, and was often lounging in the offices there,\r\ndropping bits of private, official information, which were immediately,\r\ncaught up and telegraphed all over the country. But it used to surprise\r\neven the Colonel when he read it, it was embellished to that degree that\r\nhe hardly recognized it, and the hint was not lost on him. He began\r\nto exaggerate his heretofore simple conversation to suit the newspaper\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nPeople used to wonder in the winters of 187- and 187-, where the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpecials\xe2\x80\x9d got that remarkable information with which they every morning\r\nsurprised the country, revealing the most secret intentions of the\r\nPresident and his cabinet, the private thoughts of political leaders,\r\nthe hidden meaning of every movement. This information was furnished by\r\nCol. Sellers.\r\n\r\nWhen he was asked, afterwards, about the stolen copy of the Alabama\r\nTreaty which got into the \xe2\x80\x9cNew York Tribune,\xe2\x80\x9d he only looked mysterious,\r\nand said that neither he nor Senator Dilworthy knew anything about it.\r\nBut those whom he was in the habit of meeting occasionally felt almost\r\ncertain that he did know.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the Colonel in his general patriotic labors\r\nneglected his own affairs. The Columbus River Navigation Scheme absorbed\r\nonly a part of his time, so he was enabled to throw quite a strong\r\nreserve force of energy into the Tennessee Land plan, a vast enterprise\r\ncommensurate with his abilities, and in the prosecution of which he was\r\ngreatly aided by Mr. Henry Brierly, who was buzzing about the capitol\r\nand the hotels day and night, and making capital for it in some\r\nmysterious way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must create a public opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Senator Dilworthy. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\nonly interest in it is a public one, and if the country wants the\r\ninstitution, Congress will have to yield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt may have been after a conversation between the Colonel and Senator\r\nDilworthy that the following special despatch was sent to a New York\r\nnewspaper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe understand that a philanthropic plan is on foot in relation to the\r\ncolored race that will, if successful, revolutionize the whole character\r\nof southern industry. An experimental institution is in contemplation\r\nin Tennessee which will do for that state what the Industrial School at\r\nZurich did for Switzerland. We learn that approaches have been made to\r\nthe heirs of the late Hon. Silas Hawkins of Missouri, in reference to a\r\nlease of a portion of their valuable property in East Tennessee. Senator\r\nDilworthy, it is understood, is inflexibly opposed to any arrangement\r\nthat will not give the government absolute control. Private interests\r\nmust give way to the public good. It is to be hoped that Col. Sellers,\r\nwho represents the heirs, will be led to see the matter in this light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n When Washington Hawkins read this despatch, he went to the Colonel in\r\nsome anxiety. He was for a lease, he didn't want to surrender anything.\r\nWhat did he think the government would offer? Two millions?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay be three, may be four,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel, \xe2\x80\x9cit's worth more than the\r\nbank of England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they will not lease,\xe2\x80\x9d said Washington, \xe2\x80\x9clet 'em make it two millions\r\nfor an undivided half. I'm not going to throw it away, not the whole of\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry told the Colonel that they must drive the thing through, he\r\ncouldn't be dallying round Washington when Spring opened. Phil wanted\r\nhim, Phil had a great thing on hand up in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the Colonel, always ready to interest himself\r\nin anything large.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mountain of coal; that's all. He's going to run a tunnel into it in\r\nthe Spring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he want any capital?\xe2\x80\x9d, asked the Colonel, in the tone of a man who\r\nis given to calculating carefully before he makes an investment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Old man Bolton's behind him. He has capital, but I judged that he\r\nwanted my experience in starting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he wants me, tell him I'll come, after Congress adjourns. I should\r\nlike to give him a little lift. He lacks enterprise--now, about that\r\nColumbus River. He doesn't see his chances. But he's a good fellow, and\r\nyou can tell him that Sellers won't go back on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Harry, \xe2\x80\x9cwho is that rather handsome party that's\r\nhanging 'round Laura? I see him with her everywhere, at the Capitol,\r\nin the horse cars, and he comes to Dilworthy's. If he weren't lame, I\r\nshould think he was going to run off with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that's nothing. Laura knows her business. He has a cotton claim.\r\nUsed to be at Hawkeye during the war.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSelby's his name, was a Colonel. Got a wife and family. Very\r\nrespectable people, the Selby's.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that's all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry, \xe2\x80\x9cif it's business. But if a woman\r\nlooked at me as I've seen her at Selby, I should understand it. And it's\r\ntalked about, I can tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJealousy had no doubt sharpened this young gentleman's observation.\r\nLaura could not have treated him with more lofty condescension if she\r\nhad been the Queen of Sheba, on a royal visit to the great republic.\r\nAnd he resented it, and was \xe2\x80\x9chuffy\xe2\x80\x9d when he was with her, and ran her\r\nerrands, and brought her gossip, and bragged of his intimacy with the\r\nlovely creature among the fellows at Newspaper Row.\r\n\r\nLaura's life was rushing on now in the full stream of intrigue and\r\nfashionable dissipation. She was conspicuous at the balls of the fastest\r\nset, and was suspected of being present at those doubtful suppers that\r\nbegan late and ended early. If Senator Dilworthy remonstrated about\r\nappearances, she had a way of silencing him. Perhaps she had some hold\r\non him, perhaps she was necessary to his plan for ameliorating the\r\ncondition of the colored race.\r\n\r\nShe saw Col. Selby, when the public knew and when it did not know. She\r\nwould see him, whatever excuses he made, and however he avoided her.\r\nShe was urged on by a fever of love and hatred and jealousy, which\r\nalternately possessed her. Sometimes she petted him, and coaxed him and\r\ntried all her fascinations. And again she threatened him and reproached\r\nhim. What was he doing? Why had he taken no steps to free himself? Why\r\ndidn't he send his wife home? She should have money soon. They could go\r\nto Europe--anywhere. What did she care for talk?\r\n\r\nAnd he promised, and lied, and invented fresh excuses for delay, like a\r\ncowardly gambler and roue as he was, fearing to break with her, and half\r\nthe time unwilling to give her up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat woman doesn't know what fear is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cand she\r\nwatches me like a hawk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe told his wife that this woman was a lobbyist, whom he had to tolerate\r\nand use in getting through his claims, and that he should pay her and\r\nhave done with her, when he succeeded.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nHenry Brierly was at the Dilworthy's constantly and on such terms of\r\nintimacy that he came and went without question. The Senator was not an\r\ninhospitable man, he liked to have guests in his house, and Harry's gay\r\nhumor and rattling way entertained him; for even the most devout men and\r\nbusy statesmen must have hours of relaxation.\r\n\r\nHarry himself believed that he was of great service in the University\r\nbusiness, and that the success of the scheme depended upon him to a\r\ngreat degree. He spent many hours in talking it over with the Senator\r\nafter dinner. He went so far as to consider whether it would be worth\r\nhis while to take the professorship of civil engineering in the new\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nBut it was not the Senator's society nor his dinners--at which this\r\nscapegrace remarked that there was too much grace and too little\r\nwine--which attracted him to the house. The fact was the poor fellow\r\nhung around there day after day for the chance of seeing Laura for five\r\nminutes at a time. For her presence at dinner he would endure the long\r\nbore of the Senator's talk afterwards, while Laura was off at some\r\nassembly, or excused herself on the plea of fatigue. Now and then he\r\naccompanied her to some reception, and rarely, on off nights, he was\r\nblessed with her company in the parlor, when he sang, and was chatty\r\nand vivacious and performed a hundred little tricks of imitation and\r\nventriloquism, and made himself as entertaining as a man could be.\r\n\r\nIt puzzled him not a little that all his fascinations seemed to go for\r\nso little with Laura; it was beyond his experience with women. Sometimes\r\nLaura was exceedingly kind and petted him a little, and took the trouble\r\nto exert her powers of pleasing, and to entangle him deeper and deeper.\r\nBut this, it angered him afterwards to think, was in private; in public\r\nshe was beyond his reach, and never gave occasion to the suspicion\r\nthat she had any affair with him. He was never permitted to achieve the\r\ndignity of a serious flirtation with her in public.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you treat me so?\xe2\x80\x9d he once said, reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTreat you how?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Laura in a sweet voice, lifting her eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know well enough. You let other fellows monopolize you in society,\r\nand you are as indifferent to me as if we were strangers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I help it if they are attentive, can I be rude? But we are such old\r\nfriends, Mr. Brierly, that I didn't suppose you would be jealous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I must be a very old friend, then, by your conduct towards me.\r\nBy the same rule I should judge that Col. Selby must be very new.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura looked up quickly, as if about to return an indignant answer\r\nto such impertinence, but she only said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what of Col. Selby,\r\nsauce-box?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, probably, you'll care for. Your being with him so much is the\r\ntown talk, that's all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do people say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Laura calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they say a good many things. You are offended, though, to have me\r\nspeak of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least. You are my true friend. I feel that I can trust you.\r\nYou wouldn't deceive me, Harry?\xe2\x80\x9d throwing into her eyes a look of trust\r\nand tenderness that melted away all his petulance and distrust. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do\r\nthey say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome say that you've lost your head about him; others that you don't\r\ncare any more for him than you do for a dozen others, but that he is\r\ncompletely fascinated with you and about to desert his wife; and others\r\nsay it is nonsense to suppose you would entangle yourself with a married\r\nman, and that your intimacy only arises from the matter of the cotton,\r\nclaims, for which he wants your influence with Dilworthy. But you know\r\neverybody is talked about more or less in Washington. I shouldn't care;\r\nbut I wish you wouldn't have so much to do with Selby, Laura,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nHarry, fancying that he was now upon such terms that his, advice, would\r\nbe heeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you believed these slanders?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't believe anything against you, Laura, but Col. Selby does not\r\nmean you any good. I know you wouldn't be seen with him if you knew his\r\nreputation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know him?\xe2\x80\x9d Laura asked, as indifferently as she could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a little. I was at his lodgings' in Georgetown a day or two ago,\r\nwith Col. Sellers. Sellers wanted to talk with him about some patent\r\nremedy he has, Eye Water, or something of that sort, which he wants to\r\nintroduce into Europe. Selby is going abroad very soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura started; in spite of her self-control.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd his wife!--Does he take his family? Did you see his wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. A dark little woman, rather worn--must have been pretty once\r\nthough. Has three or four children, one of them a baby. They'll all\r\ngo of course. She said she should be glad enough to get away from\r\nWashington. You know Selby has got his claim allowed, and they say he\r\nhas had a run of luck lately at Morrissey's.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura heard all this in a kind of stupor, looking straight at Harry,\r\nwithout seeing him. Is it possible, she was thinking, that this base\r\nwretch, after all his promises, will take his wife and children and\r\nleave me? Is it possible the town is saying all these things about me?\r\nAnd a look of bitterness coming into her face--does the fool think he\r\ncan escape so?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are angry with me, Laura,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry, not comprehending in the\r\nleast what was going on in her mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAngry?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, forcing herself to come back to his presence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith you? Oh no. I'm angry with the cruel world, which, pursues an\r\nindependent woman as it never does a man. I'm grateful to you Harry; I'm\r\ngrateful to you for telling me of that odious man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she rose from her chair and gave him her pretty hand, which the\r\nsilly fellow took, and kissed and clung to. And he said many silly\r\nthings, before she disengaged herself gently, and left him, saying it\r\nwas time to dress, for dinner.\r\n\r\nAnd Harry went away, excited, and a little hopeful, but only a little.\r\nThe happiness was only a gleam, which departed and left him thoroughly\r\nmiserable. She never would love him, and she was going to the devil,\r\nbesides. He couldn't shut his eyes to what he saw, nor his ears to what\r\nhe heard of her.\r\n\r\nWhat had come over this thrilling young lady-killer? It was a pity to\r\nsee such a gay butterfly broken on a wheel. Was there something good in\r\nhim, after all, that had been touched? He was in fact madly in love with\r\nthis woman.\r\n\r\nIt is not for us to analyze the passion and say whether it was a worthy\r\none. It absorbed his whole nature and made him wretched enough. If he\r\ndeserved punishment, what more would you have? Perhaps this love was\r\nkindling a new heroism in him.\r\n\r\nHe saw the road on which Laura was going clearly enough, though he did\r\nnot believe the worst he heard of her. He loved her too passionately to\r\ncredit that for a moment. And it seemed to him that if he could compel\r\nher to recognize her position, and his own devotion, she might love him,\r\nand that he could save her. His love was so far ennobled, and become\r\na very different thing from its beginning in Hawkeye. Whether he ever\r\nthought that if he could save her from ruin, he could give her up\r\nhimself, is doubtful. Such a pitch of virtue does not occur often in\r\nreal life, especially in such natures as Harry's, whose generosity\r\nand unselfishness were matters of temperament rather than habits or\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nHe wrote a long letter to Laura, an incoherent, passionate letter,\r\npouring out his love as he could not do in her presence, and warning her\r\nas plainly as he dared of the dangers that surrounded her, and the risks\r\nshe ran of compromising herself in many ways.\r\n\r\nLaura read the letter, with a little sigh may be, as she thought of\r\nother days, but with contempt also, and she put it into the fire with\r\nthe thought, \xe2\x80\x9cThey are all alike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry was in the habit of writing to Philip freely, and boasting also\r\nabout his doings, as he could not help doing and remain himself.\r\nMixed up with his own exploits, and his daily triumphs as a lobbyist,\r\nespecially in the matter of the new University, in which Harry was to\r\nhave something handsome, were amusing sketches of Washington society,\r\nhints about Dilworthy, stories about Col. Sellers, who had become a\r\nwell-known character, and wise remarks upon the machinery of private\r\nlegislation for the public-good, which greatly entertained Philip in his\r\nconvalescence.\r\n\r\nLaura's name occurred very often in these letters, at first in casual\r\nmention as the belle of the season, carrying everything before her with\r\nher wit and beauty, and then more seriously, as if Harry did not exactly\r\nlike so much general admiration of her, and was a little nettled by her\r\ntreatment of him.\r\n\r\nThis was so different from Harry's usual tone about women, that Philip\r\nwondered a good deal over it. Could it be possible that he was seriously\r\naffected? Then came stories about Laura, town talk, gossip which Harry\r\ndenied the truth of indignantly; but he was evidently uneasy, and at\r\nlength wrote in such miserable spirits that Philip asked him squarely\r\nwhat the trouble was; was he in love?\r\n\r\nUpon this, Harry made a clean breast of it, and told Philip all he\r\nknew about the Selby affair, and Laura's treatment of him, sometimes\r\nencouraging him--and then throwing him off, and finally his belief that\r\nshe would go to the bad if something was not done to arouse her from her\r\ninfatuation. He wished Philip was in Washington. He knew Laura, and\r\nshe had a great respect for his character, his opinions, his judgment.\r\nPerhaps he, as an uninterested person in whom she would have some\r\nconfidence, and as one of the public, could say some thing to her that\r\nwould show her where she stood.\r\n\r\nPhilip saw the situation clearly enough. Of Laura he knew not much,\r\nexcept that she was a woman of uncommon fascination, and he thought from\r\nwhat he had seen of her in Hawkeye, her conduct towards him and towards\r\nHarry, of not too much principle. Of course he knew nothing of her\r\nhistory; he knew nothing seriously against her, and if Harry was\r\ndesperately enamored of her, why should he not win her if he could.\r\nIf, however, she had already become what Harry uneasily felt she might\r\nbecome, was it not his duty to go to the rescue of his friend and try to\r\nsave him from any rash act on account of a woman that might prove to\r\nbe entirely unworthy of him; for trifler and visionary as he was, Harry\r\ndeserved a better fate than this.\r\n\r\nPhilip determined to go to Washington and see for himself. He had other\r\nreasons also. He began to know enough of Mr. Bolton's affairs to be\r\nuneasy. Pennybacker had been there several times during the winter, and\r\nhe suspected that he was involving Mr. Bolton in some doubtful scheme.\r\nPennybacker was in Washington, and Philip thought he might perhaps find\r\nout something about him, and his plans, that would be of service to Mr.\r\nBolton.\r\n\r\nPhilip had enjoyed his winter very well, for a man with his arm broken\r\nand his head smashed. With two such nurses as Ruth and Alice,\r\nillness seemed to him rather a nice holiday, and every moment of his\r\nconvalescence had been precious and all too fleeting. With a young\r\nfellow of the habits of Philip, such injuries cannot be counted on\r\nto tarry long, even for the purpose of love-making, and Philip found\r\nhimself getting strong with even disagreeable rapidity.\r\n\r\nDuring his first weeks of pain and weakness, Ruth was unceasing in\r\nher ministrations; she quietly took charge of him, and with a gentle\r\nfirmness resisted all attempts of Alice or any one else to share to any\r\ngreat extent the burden with her. She was clear, decisive and peremptory\r\nin whatever she did; but often when Philip opened his eyes in those\r\nfirst days of suffering and found her standing by his bedside, he saw\r\na look of tenderness in her anxious face that quickened his already\r\nfeverish pulse, a look that remained in his heart long after he closed\r\nhis eyes. Sometimes he felt her hand on his forehead, and did not open\r\nhis eyes for fear she would take it away. He watched for her coming to\r\nhis chamber; he could distinguish her light footstep from all others.\r\nIf this is what is meant by women practicing medicine, thought Philip to\r\nhimself, I like it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuth,\xe2\x80\x9d said he one day when he was getting to be quite himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nbelieve in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve in what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, in women physicians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, I'd better call in Mrs. Dr. Longstreet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no. One will do, one at a time. I think I should be well tomorrow,\r\nif I thought I should never have any other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThy physician thinks thee mustn't talk, Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ruth putting her\r\nfinger on his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Ruth, I want to tell you that I should wish I never had got well\r\nif--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there, thee must not talk. Thee is wandering again,\xe2\x80\x9d and Ruth\r\nclosed his lips, with a smile on her own that broadened into a merry\r\nlaugh as she ran away.\r\n\r\nPhilip was not weary, however, of making these attempts, he rather\r\nenjoyed it. But whenever he inclined to be sentimental, Ruth would cut\r\nhim off, with some such gravely conceived speech as, \xe2\x80\x9cDoes thee think\r\nthat thy physician will take advantage of the condition of a man who is\r\nas weak as thee is? I will call Alice, if thee has any dying confessions\r\nto make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Philip convalesced, Alice more and more took Ruth's place as his\r\nentertainer, and read to him by the hour, when he did not want to\r\ntalk--to talk about Ruth, as he did a good deal of the time. Nor was\r\nthis altogether unsatisfactory to Philip. He was always happy and\r\ncontented with Alice. She was the most restful person he knew. Better\r\ninformed than Ruth and with a much more varied culture, and bright and\r\nsympathetic, he was never weary of her company, if he was not greatly\r\nexcited by it. She had upon his mind that peaceful influence that Mrs.\r\nBolton had when, occasionally, she sat by his bedside with her work.\r\nSome people have this influence, which is like an emanation. They bring\r\npeace to a house, they diffuse serene content in a room full of mixed\r\ncompany, though they may say very little, and are apparently unconscious\r\nof their own power.\r\n\r\nNot that Philip did not long for Ruth's presence all the same. Since\r\nhe was well enough to be about the house, she was busy again with her\r\nstudies. Now and then her teasing humor came again. She always had a\r\nplayful shield against his sentiment. Philip used sometimes to declare\r\nthat she had no sentiment; and then he doubted if he should be pleased\r\nwith her after all if she were at all sentimental; and he rejoiced that\r\nshe had, in such matters what he called the airy grace of sanity. She\r\nwas the most gay serious person he ever saw.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was not so much at rest or so contented with her as with\r\nAlice. But then he loved her. And what have rest and contentment to do\r\nwith love?\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nMr. Buckstone's campaign was brief--much briefer than he supposed it\r\nwould be. He began it purposing to win Laura without being won himself;\r\nbut his experience was that of all who had fought on that field before\r\nhim; he diligently continued his effort to win her, but he presently\r\nfound that while as yet he could not feel entirely certain of having\r\nwon her, it was very manifest that she had won him. He had made an able\r\nfight, brief as it was, and that at least was to his credit. He was in\r\ngood company, now; he walked in a leash of conspicuous captives. These\r\nunfortunates followed Laura helplessly, for whenever she took a prisoner\r\nhe remained her slave henceforth. Sometimes they chafed in their\r\nbondage; sometimes they tore themselves free and said their serfdom\r\nwas ended; but sooner or later they always came back penitent and\r\nworshiping. Laura pursued her usual course: she encouraged Mr. Buckstone\r\nby turns, and by turns she harassed him; she exalted him to the clouds\r\nat one time, and at another she dragged him down again. She constituted\r\nhim chief champion of the Knobs University bill, and he accepted the\r\nposition, at first reluctantly, but later as a valued means of serving\r\nher--he even came to look upon it as a piece of great good fortune,\r\nsince it brought him into such frequent contact with her.\r\n\r\nThrough him she learned that the Hon. Mr. Trollop was a bitter enemy of\r\nher bill. He urged her not to attempt to influence Mr. Trollop in any\r\nway, and explained that whatever she might attempt in that direction\r\nwould surely be used against her and with damaging effect.\r\n\r\nShe at first said she knew Mr. Trollop, \xe2\x80\x9cand was aware that he had\r\na Blank-Blank;\xe2\x80\x9d--[**Her private figure of speech for Brother--or\r\nSon-in-law]--but Mr. Buckstone said that he was not able to conceive\r\nwhat so curious a phrase as Blank-Blank might mean, and had no wish\r\nto pry into the matter, since it was probably private, he \xe2\x80\x9cwould\r\nnevertheless venture the blind assertion that nothing would answer\r\nin this particular case and during this particular session but to be\r\nexceedingly wary and keep clear away from Mr. Trollop; any other course\r\nwould be fatal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed that nothing could be done. Laura was seriously troubled.\r\nEverything was looking well, and yet it was plain that one vigorous and\r\ndetermined enemy might eventually succeed in overthrowing all her plans.\r\nA suggestion came into her mind presently and she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan't you fight against his great Pension bill and bring him to terms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, never; he and I are sworn brothers on that measure; we work in\r\nharness and are very loving--I do everything I possibly can for him\r\nthere. But I work with might and main against his Immigration bill,--as\r\npertinaciously and as vindictively, indeed, as he works against our\r\nUniversity. We hate each other through half a conversation and are all\r\naffection through the other half. We understand each other. He is an\r\nadmirable worker outside the capitol; he will do more for the Pension\r\nbill than any other man could do; I wish he would make the great speech\r\non it which he wants to make--and then I would make another and we would\r\nbe safe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell if he wants to make a great speech why doesn't he do it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVisitors interrupted the conversation and Mr. Buckstone took his leave.\r\nIt was not of the least moment to Laura that her question had not been\r\nanswered, inasmuch as it concerned a thing which did not interest her;\r\nand yet, human being like, she thought she would have liked to know. An\r\nopportunity occurring presently, she put the same question to another\r\nperson and got an answer that satisfied her. She pondered a good while\r\nthat night, after she had gone to bed, and when she finally turned over\r\nto go to sleep, she had thought out a new scheme. The next evening at\r\nMrs. Gloverson's party, she said to Mr. Buckstone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want Mr. Trollop to make his great speech on the Pension bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you? But you remember I was interrupted, and did not explain to\r\nyou--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, I know. You must make him make that speech. I very\r\nparticularly desire it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is easy to say make him do it, but how am I to make him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is perfectly easy; I have thought it all out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then went into the details. At length Mr. Buckstone said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see now. I can manage it, I am sure. Indeed I wonder he never thought\r\nof it himself--there are no end of precedents. But how is this going to\r\nbenefit you, after I have managed it? There is where the mystery lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I will take care of that. It will benefit me a great deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI only wish I could see how; it is the oddest freak. You seem to go the\r\nfurthest around to get at a thing--but you are in earnest, aren't you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes I am, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, I will do it--but why not tell me how you imagine it is\r\ngoing to help you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, by and by.--Now there is nobody talking to him. Go straight and\r\ndo it, there's a good fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA moment or two later the two sworn friends of the Pension bill were\r\ntalking together, earnestly, and seemingly unconscious of the moving\r\nthrong about them. They talked an hour, and then Mr. Buckstone came back\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hardly fancied it at first, but he fell in love with it after a bit.\r\nAnd we have made a compact, too. I am to keep his secret and he is to\r\nspare me, in future, when he gets ready to denounce the supporters of\r\nthe University bill--and I can easily believe he will keep his word on\r\nthis occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA fortnight elapsed, and the University bill had gathered to itself\r\nmany friends, meantime. Senator Dilworthy began to think the harvest\r\nwas ripe. He conferred with Laura privately. She was able to tell him\r\nexactly how the House would vote. There was a majority--the bill would\r\npass, unless weak members got frightened at the last, and deserted--a\r\nthing pretty likely to occur. The Senator said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish we had one more good strong man. Now Trollop ought to be on our\r\nside, for he is a friend of the negro. But he is against us, and is our\r\nbitterest opponent. If he would simply vote No, but keep quiet and not\r\nmolest us, I would feel perfectly cheerful and content. But perhaps\r\nthere is no use in thinking of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy I laid a little plan for his benefit two weeks ago. I think he will\r\nbe tractable, maybe. He is to come here tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook out for him, my child! He means mischief, sure. It is said that he\r\nclaims to know of improper practices having been used in the interest of\r\nthis bill, and he thinks he sees a chance to make a great sensation when\r\nthe bill comes up. Be wary. Be very, very careful, my dear. Do your very\r\nablest talking, now. You can convince a man of anything, when you try.\r\nYou must convince him that if anything improper has been done, you\r\nat least are ignorant of it and sorry for it. And if you could only\r\npersuade him out of his hostility to the bill, too--but don't overdo the\r\nthing; don't seem too anxious, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won't; I'll be ever so careful. I'll talk as sweetly to him as if he\r\nwere my own child! You may trust me--indeed you may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door-bell rang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the gentleman now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Laura. Senator Dilworthy retired to\r\nhis study.\r\n\r\nLaura welcomed Mr. Trollop, a grave, carefully dressed and very\r\nrespectable looking man, with a bald head, standing collar and old\r\nfashioned watch seals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPromptness is a virtue, Mr. Trollop, and I perceive that you have it.\r\nYou are always prompt with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always meet my engagements, of every kind, Miss Hawkins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a quality which is rarer in the world than it has been, I\r\nbelieve. I wished to see you on business, Mr. Trollop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI judged so. What can I do for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know my bill--the Knobs University bill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I believe it is your bill. I had forgotten. Yes, I know the bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, would you mind telling me your opinion of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, since you seem to ask it without reserve, I am obliged to say\r\nthat I do not regard it favorably. I have not seen the bill itself, but\r\nfrom what I can hear, it--it--well, it has a bad look about it. It--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak it out--never fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it--they say it contemplates a fraud upon the government.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Laura tranquilly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! I say 'Well?' too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, suppose it were a fraud--which I feel able to deny--would it be\r\nthe first one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou take a body's breath away! Would you--did you wish me to vote for\r\nit? Was that what you wanted to see me about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour instinct is correct. I did want you--I do want you to vote for\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVote for a fr--for a measure which is generally believed to be at\r\nleast questionable? I am afraid we cannot come to an understanding, Miss\r\nHawkins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am afraid not--if you have resumed your principles, Mr. Trollop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you send for me merely to insult me? It is time for me to take my\r\nleave, Miss Hawkins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--wait a moment. Don't be offended at a trifle. Do not be offish and\r\nunsociable. The Steamship Subsidy bill was a fraud on the government.\r\nYou voted for it, Mr. Trollop, though you always opposed the measure\r\nuntil after you had an interview one evening with a certain Mrs.\r\nMcCarter at her house. She was my agent. She was acting for me. Ah, that\r\nis right--sit down again. You can be sociable, easily enough if you have\r\na mind to. Well? I am waiting. Have you nothing to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Hawkins, I voted for that bill because when I came to examine into\r\nit--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh yes. When you came to examine into it. Well, I only want you to\r\nexamine into my bill. Mr. Trollop, you would not sell your vote on that\r\nsubsidy bill--which was perfectly right--but you accepted of some of\r\nthe stock, with the understanding that it was to stand in your\r\nbrother-in-law's name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no pr--I mean, this is, utterly groundless, Miss Hawkins.\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\nthe gentleman seemed somewhat uneasy, nevertheless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, not entirely so, perhaps. I and a person whom we will call Miss\r\nBlank (never mind the real name,) were in a closet at your elbow all the\r\nwhile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Trollop winced--then he said with dignity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Hawkins is it possible that you were capable of such a thing as\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was bad; I confess that. It was bad. Almost as bad as selling one's\r\nvote for--but I forget; you did not sell your vote--you only accepted a\r\nlittle trifle, a small token of esteem, for your brother-in-law. Oh,\r\nlet us come out and be frank with each other: I know you, Mr. Trollop.\r\nI have met you on business three or four times; true, I never offered\r\nto corrupt your principles--never hinted such a thing; but always when I\r\nhad finished sounding you, I manipulated you through an agent. Let us\r\nbe frank. Wear this comely disguise of virtue before the public--it will\r\ncount there; but here it is out of place. My dear sir, by and by there\r\nis going to be an investigation into that National Internal Improvement\r\nDirectors' Relief Measure of a few years ago, and you know very\r\nwell that you will be a crippled man, as likely as not, when it is\r\ncompleted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot be shown that a man is a knave merely for owning that stock.\r\nI am not distressed about the National Improvement Relief Measure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh indeed I am not trying to distress you. I only wished to make good\r\nmy assertion that I knew you. Several of you gentlemen bought of that\r\nstack (without paying a penny down) received dividends from it, (think\r\nof the happy idea of receiving dividends, and very large ones, too, from\r\nstock one hasn't paid for!) and all the while your names never appeared\r\nin the transaction; if ever you took the stock at all, you took it in\r\nother people's names. Now you see, you had to know one of two things;\r\nnamely, you either knew that the idea of all this preposterous\r\ngenerosity was to bribe you into future legislative friendship, or you\r\ndidn't know it. That is to say, you had to be either a knave or a--well,\r\na fool--there was no middle ground. You are not a fool, Mr. Trollop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Hawking you flatter me. But seriously, you do not forget that some\r\nof the best and purest men in Congress took that stock in that way?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Senator Blank?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no--I believe not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you believe not. Do you suppose he was ever approached, on\r\nthe subject?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had approached him, for instance, fortified with the fact that\r\nsome of the best men in Congress, and the purest, etc., etc.; what would\r\nhave been the result?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what WOULD have been the result?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would have shown you the door! For Mr. Blank is neither a knave\r\nnor a fool. There are other men in the Senate and the House whom no one\r\nwould have been hardy enough to approach with that Relief Stock in that\r\npeculiarly generous way, but they are not of the class that you regard\r\nas the best and purest. No, I say I know you Mr. Trollop. That is to\r\nsay, one may suggest a thing to Mr. Trollop which it would not do\r\nto suggest to Mr. Blank. Mr. Trollop, you are pledged to support the\r\nIndigent Congressmen's Retroactive Appropriation which is to come\r\nup, either in this or the next session. You do not deny that, even\r\nin public. The man that will vote for that bill will break the eighth\r\ncommandment in any other way, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he will not vote for your corrupt measure, nevertheless, madam!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n exclaimed Mr. Trollop, rising from his seat in a passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, but he will. Sit down again, and let me explain why. Oh, come,\r\ndon't behave so. It is very unpleasant. Now be good, and you shall have\r\nthe missing page of your great speech. Here it is!\xe2\x80\x9d--and she displayed a\r\nsheet of manuscript.\r\n\r\nMr. Trollop turned immediately back from the threshold. It might have\r\nbeen gladness that flashed into his face; it might have been something\r\nelse; but at any rate there was much astonishment mixed with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! Where did you get it? Give it me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow there is no hurry. Sit down; sit down and let us talk and be\r\nfriendly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman wavered. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, this is only a subterfuge. I will go. It is not the missing page.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura tore off a couple of lines from the bottom of the sheet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will know whether this is the handwriting or not.\r\nYou know it is the handwriting. Now if you will listen, you will know\r\nthat this must be the list of statistics which was to be the 'nub' of\r\nyour great effort, and the accompanying blast the beginning of the\r\nburst of eloquence which was continued on the next page--and you will\r\nrecognize that there was where you broke down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe read the page. Mr. Trollop said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is perfectly astounding. Still, what is all this to me? It is\r\nnothing. It does not concern me. The speech is made, and there an end. I\r\ndid break down for a moment, and in a rather uncomfortable place, since\r\nI had led up to those statistics with some grandeur; the hiatus was\r\npleasanter to the House and the galleries than it was to me. But it is\r\nno matter now. A week has passed; the jests about it ceased three or\r\nfour days ago. The whole thing is a matter of indifference to me, Miss\r\nHawkins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you apologized; and promised the statistics for next day. Why\r\ndidn't you keep your promise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe matter was not of sufficient consequence. The time was gone by to\r\nproduce an effect with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I hear that other friends of the Soldiers' Pension Bill desire them\r\nvery much. I think you ought to let them have them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Hawkins, this silly blunder of my copyist evidently has more\r\ninterest for you than it has for me. I will send my private secretary to\r\nyou and let him discuss the subject with you at length.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he copy your speech for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course he did. Why all these questions? Tell me--how did you get\r\nhold of that page of manuscript? That is the only thing that stirs a\r\npassing interest in my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm coming to that.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she said, much as if she were talking to\r\nherself: \xe2\x80\x9cIt does seem like taking a deal of unnecessary pains, for a\r\nbody to hire another body to construct a great speech for him and then\r\ngo and get still another body to copy it before it can be read in the\r\nHouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Hawkins, what do you mean by such talk as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy I am sure I mean no harm--no harm to anybody in the world. I am\r\ncertain that I overheard the Hon. Mr. Buckstone either promise to write\r\nyour great speech for you or else get some other competent person to do\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is perfectly absurd, madam, perfectly absurd!\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Trollop\r\naffected a laugh of derision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the thing has occurred before now. I mean that I have heard that\r\nCongressmen have sometimes hired literary grubs to build speeches for\r\nthem.--Now didn't I overhear a conversation like that I spoke of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPshaw! Why of course you may have overheard some such jesting nonsense.\r\nBut would one be in earnest about so farcical a thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell if it was only a joke, why did you make a serious matter of it?\r\nWhy did you get the speech written for you, and then read it in the\r\nHouse without ever having it copied?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Trollop did not laugh this time; he seemed seriously perplexed. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, play out your jest, Miss Hawkins. I can't understand what you are\r\ncontriving--but it seems to entertain you--so please, go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, I assure you; but I hope to make the matter entertaining to\r\nyou, too. Your private secretary never copied your speech.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed? Really you seem to know my affairs better than I do myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I do. You can't name your own amanuensis, Mr. Trollop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is sad, indeed. Perhaps Miss Hawkins can?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I can. I wrote your speech myself, and you read it from my\r\nmanuscript. There, now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Trollop did not spring to his feet and smite his brow with his hand\r\nwhile a cold sweat broke out all over him and the color forsook his\r\nface--no, he only said, \xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d and looked greatly astonished.\r\n\r\nLaura handed him her commonplace-book and called his attention to the\r\nfact that the handwriting there and the handwriting of this speech were\r\nthe same. He was shortly convinced. He laid the book aside and said,\r\ncomposedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the wonderful tragedy is done, and it transpires that I am\r\nindebted to you for my late eloquence. What of it? What was all this for\r\nand what does it amount to after all? What do you propose to do about\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh nothing. It is only a bit of pleasantry. When I overheard that\r\nconversation I took an early opportunity to ask Mr. Buckstone if he knew\r\nof anybody who might want a speech written--I had a friend, and so forth\r\nand so on. I was the friend, myself; I thought I might do you a good\r\nturn then and depend on you to do me one by and by. I never let Mr.\r\nBuckstone have the speech till the last moment, and when you hurried\r\noff to the House with it, you did not know there was a missing page, of\r\ncourse, but I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now perhaps you think that if I refuse to support your bill, you\r\nwill make a grand exposure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell I had not thought of that. I only kept back the page for the mere\r\nfun of the thing; but since you mention it, I don't know but I might do\r\nsomething if I were angry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Miss Hawkins, if you were to give out that you composed my\r\nspeech, you know very well that people would say it was only your\r\nraillery, your fondness for putting a victim in the pillory and amusing\r\nthe public at his expense. It is too flimsy, Miss Hawkins, for a person\r\nof your fine inventive talent--contrive an abler device than that.\r\nCome!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is easily done, Mr. Trollop. I will hire a man, and pin this page\r\non his breast, and label it, 'The Missing Fragment of the Hon. Mr.\r\nTrollop's Great Speech--which speech was written and composed by Miss\r\nLaura Hawkins under a secret understanding for one hundred dollars--and\r\nthe money has not been paid.' And I will pin round about it notes in my\r\nhandwriting, which I will procure from prominent friends of mine for the\r\noccasion; also your printed speech in the Globe, showing the connection\r\nbetween its bracketed hiatus and my Fragment; and I give you my word of\r\nhonor that I will stand that human bulletin board in the rotunda of the\r\ncapitol and make him stay there a week! You see you are premature, Mr.\r\nTrollop, the wonderful tragedy is not done yet, by any means. Come, now,\r\ndoesn't it improve?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr Trollop opened his eyes rather widely at this novel aspect of the\r\ncase. He got up and walked the floor and gave himself a moment for\r\nreflection. Then he stopped and studied Laura's face a while, and ended\r\nby saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I am obliged to believe you would be reckless enough to do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen don't put me to the test, Mr. Trollop. But let's drop the matter.\r\nI have had my joke and you've borne the infliction becomingly enough. It\r\nspoils a jest to harp on it after one has had one's laugh. I would much\r\nrather talk about my bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo would I, now, my clandestine amanuensis. Compared with some other\r\nsubjects, even your bill is a pleasant topic to discuss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good indeed! I thought I could persuade you. Now I am sure you\r\nwill be generous to the poor negro and vote for that bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I feel more tenderly toward the oppressed colored man than I did.\r\nShall we bury the hatchet and be good friends and respect each other's\r\nlittle secrets, on condition that I vote Aye on the measure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith all my heart, Mr. Trollop. I give you my word of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a bargain. But isn't there something else you could give me,\r\ntoo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura looked at him inquiringly a moment, and then she comprehended.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes! You may have it now. I haven't any more use for it.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\npicked up the page of manuscript, but she reconsidered her intention of\r\nhanding it to him, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut never mind; I will keep it close; no\r\none shall see it; you shall have it as soon as your vote is recorded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Trollop looked disappointed. But presently made his adieux, and had\r\ngot as far as the hall, when something occurred to Laura. She said to\r\nherself, \xe2\x80\x9cI don't simply want his vote under compulsion--he might vote\r\naye, but work against the bill in secret, for revenge; that man is\r\nunscrupulous enough to do anything. I must have his hearty co-operation\r\nas well as his vote. There is only one way to get that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe called him back, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI value your vote, Mr. Trollop, but I value your influence more. You\r\nare able to help a measure along in many ways, if you choose. I want to\r\nask you to work for the bill as well as vote for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt takes so much of one's time, Miss Hawkins--and time is money, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know it is--especially in Congress. Now there is no use in you\r\nand I dealing in pretenses and going at matters in round-about ways. We\r\nknow each other--disguises are nonsense. Let us be plain. I will make it\r\nan object to you to work for the bill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't make it unnecessarily plain, please. There are little proprieties\r\nthat are best preserved. What do you propose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this.\xe2\x80\x9d She mentioned the names of several prominent Congressmen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cthese gentlemen are to vote and work for the bill,\r\nsimply out of love for the negro--and out of pure generosity I have put\r\nin a relative of each as a member of the University incorporation. They\r\nwill handle a million or so of money, officially, but will receive no\r\nsalaries. A larger number of statesmen are to vote and work for\r\nthe bill--also out of love for the negro--gentlemen of but moderate\r\ninfluence, these--and out of pure generosity I am to see that relatives\r\nof theirs have positions in the University, with salaries, and good\r\nones, too. You will vote and work for the bill, from mere affection for\r\nthe negro, and I desire to testify my gratitude becomingly. Make free\r\nchoice. Have you any friend whom you would like to present with a\r\nsalaried or unsalaried position in our institution?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have a brother-in-law--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat same old brother-in-law, you good unselfish provider! I have heard\r\nof him often, through my agents. How regularly he does 'turn up,' to\r\nbe sure. He could deal with those millions virtuously, and withal\r\nwith ability, too--but of course you would rather he had a salaried\r\nposition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman, facetiously, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are very humble, very\r\nhumble in our desires; we want no money; we labor solely, for\r\nour country and require no reward but the luxury of an applauding\r\nconscience. Make him one of those poor hard working unsalaried\r\ncorporators and let him do every body good with those millions--and go\r\nhungry himself! I will try to exert a little influence in favor of the\r\nbill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArrived at home, Mr. Trollop sat down and thought it all over--something\r\nafter this fashion: it is about the shape it might have taken if he had\r\nspoken it aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy reputation is getting a little damaged, and I meant to clear it up\r\nbrilliantly with an exposure of this bill at the supreme moment, and\r\nride back into Congress on the eclat of it; and if I had that bit of\r\nmanuscript, I would do it yet. It would be more money in my pocket in\r\nthe end, than my brother-in-law will get out of that incorporatorship,\r\nfat as it is. But that sheet of paper is out of my reach--she will never\r\nlet that get out of her hands. And what a mountain it is! It blocks up\r\nmy road, completely. She was going to hand it to me, once. Why didn't\r\nshe! Must be a deep woman. Deep devil! That is what she is; a beautiful\r\ndevil--and perfectly fearless, too. The idea of her pinning that paper\r\non a man and standing him up in the rotunda looks absurd at a first\r\nglance. But she would do it! She is capable of doing anything. I went\r\nthere hoping she would try to bribe me--good solid capital that would be\r\nin the exposure. Well, my prayer was answered; she did try to bribe me;\r\nand I made the best of a bad bargain and let her. I am checkmated. I\r\nmust contrive something fresh to get back to Congress on. Very well; a\r\nbird in the hand is worth two in the bush; I will work for the bill--the\r\nincorporatorship will be a very good thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mr. Trollop had taken his leave, Laura ran to Senator\r\nDilworthy and began to speak, but he interrupted her and said\r\ndistressfully, without even turning from his writing to look at her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly half an hour! You gave it up early, child. However, it was best,\r\nit was best--I'm sure it was best--and safest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it up! I!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Senator sprang up, all aglow:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy child, you can't mean that you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI've made him promise on honor to think about a compromise tonight and\r\ncome and tell me his decision in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! There's hope yet that--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, uncle. I've made him engage to let the Tennessee Land bill\r\nutterly alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible! You--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI've made him promise to vote with us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cINCREDIBLE! Abso--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI've made him swear that he'll work for us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPRE - - - POSTEROUS!--Utterly pre--break a window, child, before I\r\nsuffocate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter, it's true anyway. Now we can march into Congress with drums\r\nbeating and colors flying!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--well--well. I'm sadly bewildered, sadly bewildered. I can't\r\nunderstand it at all--the most extraordinary woman that ever--it's\r\na great day, it's a great day. There--there--let me put my hand in\r\nbenediction on this precious head. Ah, my child, the poor negro will\r\nbless--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh bother the poor negro, uncle! Put it in your speech. Good-night,\r\ngood-bye--we'll marshal our forces and march with the dawn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura reflected a while, when she was alone, and then fell to laughing,\r\npeacefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody works for me,\xe2\x80\x9d--so ran her thought. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a good idea to\r\nmake Buckstone lead Mr. Trollop on to get a great speech written for\r\nhim; and it was a happy part of the same idea for me to copy the speech\r\nafter Mr. Buckstone had written it, and then keep back a page. Mr. B.\r\nwas very complimentary to me when Trollop's break-down in the House\r\nshowed him the object of my mysterious scheme; I think he will say still\r\nfiner things when I tell him the triumph the sequel to it has gained for\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what a coward the man was, to believe I would have exposed that\r\npage in the rotunda, and so exposed myself. However, I don't know--I\r\ndon't know. I will think a moment. Suppose he voted no; suppose the bill\r\nfailed; that is to suppose this stupendous game lost forever, that\r\nI have played so desperately for; suppose people came around pitying\r\nme--odious! And he could have saved me by his single voice. Yes, I would\r\nhave exposed him! What would I care for the talk that that would have\r\nmade about me when I was gone to Europe with Selby and all the world was\r\nbusy with my history and my dishonor? It would be almost happiness to\r\nspite somebody at such a time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nThe very next day, sure enough, the campaign opened. In due course,\r\nthe Speaker of the House reached that Order of Business which is termed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNotices of Bills,\xe2\x80\x9d and then the Hon. Mr. Buckstone rose in his place\r\nand gave notice of a bill \xe2\x80\x9cTo Found and Incorporate the Knobs Industrial\r\nUniversity,\xe2\x80\x9d and then sat down without saying anything further. The busy\r\ngentlemen in the reporters' gallery jotted a line in their note-books,\r\nran to the telegraphic desk in a room which communicated with their own\r\nwriting-parlor, and then hurried back to their places in the gallery;\r\nand by the time they had resumed their seats, the line which they had\r\ndelivered to the operator had been read in telegraphic offices in towns\r\nand cities hundreds of miles away. It was distinguished by frankness of\r\nlanguage as well as by brevity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe child is born. Buckstone gives notice of the thieving Knobs\r\nUniversity job. It is said the noses have been counted and enough votes\r\nhave been bought to pass it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor some time the correspondents had been posting their several journals\r\nupon the alleged disreputable nature of the bill, and furnishing daily\r\nreports of the Washington gossip concerning it. So the next morning,\r\nnearly every newspaper of character in the land assailed the measure and\r\nhurled broadsides of invective at Mr. Buckstone. The Washington papers\r\nwere more respectful, as usual--and conciliatory, also, as usual. They\r\ngenerally supported measures, when it was possible; but when they\r\ncould not they \xe2\x80\x9cdeprecated\xe2\x80\x9d violent expressions of opinion in other\r\njournalistic quarters.\r\n\r\nThey always deprecated, when there was trouble ahead. However, 'The\r\nWashington Daily Love-Feast' hailed the bill with warm approbation.\r\nThis was Senator Balaam's paper--or rather, \xe2\x80\x9cBrother\xe2\x80\x9d Balaam, as he\r\nwas popularly called, for he had been a clergyman, in his day; and he\r\nhimself and all that he did still emitted an odor of sanctity now that\r\nhe had diverged into journalism and politics. He was a power in the\r\nCongressional prayer meeting, and in all movements that looked to the\r\nspread of religion and temperance.\r\n\r\nHis paper supported the new bill with gushing affection; it was a noble\r\nmeasure; it was a just measure; it was a generous measure; it was a pure\r\nmeasure, and that surely should recommend it in these corrupt times;\r\nand finally, if the nature of the bill were not known at all, the 'Love\r\nFeast' would support it anyway, and unhesitatingly, for the fact that\r\nSenator Dilworthy was the originator of the measure was a guaranty that\r\nit contemplated a worthy and righteous work.\r\n\r\nSenator Dilworthy was so anxious to know what the New York papers would\r\nsay about the bill, that he had arranged to have synopses of their\r\neditorials telegraphed to him; he could not wait for the papers\r\nthemselves to crawl along down to Washington by a mail train which has\r\nnever run over a cow since the road was built; for the reason that it\r\nhas never been able to overtake one. It carries the usual \xe2\x80\x9ccow-catcher\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n in front of the locomotive, but this is mere ostentation. It ought to be\r\nattached to the rear car, where it could do some good; but instead, no\r\nprovision is made there for the protection of the traveling public,\r\nand hence it is not a matter of surprise that cows so frequently climb\r\naboard that train and among the passengers.\r\n\r\nThe Senator read his dispatches aloud at the breakfast table. Laura\r\nwas troubled beyond measure at their tone, and said that that sort of\r\ncomment would defeat the bill; but the Senator said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not at all, not at all, my child. It is just what we want.\r\nPersecution is the one thing needful, now--all the other forces are\r\nsecured. Give us newspaper persecution enough, and we are safe. Vigorous\r\npersecution will alone carry a bill sometimes, dear; and when you start\r\nwith a strong vote in the first place, persecution comes in with double\r\neffect. It scares off some of the weak supporters, true, but it soon\r\nturns strong ones into stubborn ones. And then, presently, it changes\r\nthe tide of public opinion. The great public is weak-minded; the great\r\npublic is sentimental; the great public always turns around and weeps\r\nfor an odious murderer, and prays for him, and carries flowers to his\r\nprison and besieges the governor with appeals to his clemency, as soon\r\nas the papers begin to howl for that man's blood.--In a word, the great\r\nputty-hearted public loves to 'gush,' and there is no such darling\r\nopportunity to gush as a case of persecution affords.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, uncle, dear; if your theory is right, let us go into raptures,\r\nfor nobody can ask a heartier persecution than these editorials are\r\nfurnishing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so sure of that, my daughter. I don't entirely like the tone\r\nof some of these remarks. They lack vim, they lack venom. Here is one\r\ncalls it a 'questionable measure.' Bah, there is no strength in that.\r\nThis one is better; it calls it 'highway robbery.' That sounds something\r\nlike. But now this one seems satisfied to call it an 'iniquitous\r\nscheme'. 'Iniquitous' does not exasperate anybody; it is weak--puerile.\r\nThe ignorant will imagine it to be intended for a compliment. But this\r\nother one--the one I read last--has the true ring: 'This vile, dirty\r\neffort to rob the public treasury, by the kites and vultures that now\r\ninfest the filthy den called Congress'--that is admirable, admirable! We\r\nmust have more of that sort. But it will come--no fear of that; they're\r\nnot warmed up, yet. A week from now you'll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncle, you and Brother Balaam are bosom friends--why don't you get his\r\npaper to persecute us, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn't worth while, my daughter. His support doesn't hurt a bill.\r\nNobody reads his editorials but himself. But I wish the New York papers\r\nwould talk a little plainer. It is annoying to have to wait a week for\r\nthem to warm up. I expected better things at their hands--and time is\r\nprecious, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the proper hour, according to his previous notice, Mr. Buckstone duly\r\nintroduced his bill entitled \xe2\x80\x9cAn Act to Found and Incorporate the Knobs\r\nIndustrial University,\xe2\x80\x9d moved its proper reference, and sat down.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker of the House rattled off this observation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Fnobjectionbilltakuzhlcoixrssoreferred!'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHabitues of the House comprehended that this long, lightning-heeled\r\nword signified that if there was no objection, the bill would take the\r\ncustomary course of a measure of its nature, and be referred to the\r\nCommittee on Benevolent Appropriations, and that it was accordingly so\r\nreferred. Strangers merely supposed that the Speaker was taking a gargle\r\nfor some affection of the throat.\r\n\r\nThe reporters immediately telegraphed the introduction of the bill.--And\r\nthey added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe assertion that the bill will pass was premature. It is said that\r\nmany favorers of it will desert when the storm breaks upon them from\r\nthe public press.\xe2\x80\x9d The storm came, and during ten days it waxed more and\r\nmore violent day by day. The great \xe2\x80\x9cNegro University Swindle\xe2\x80\x9d became the\r\none absorbing topic of conversation throughout the Union. Individuals\r\ndenounced it, journals denounced it, public meetings denounced it, the\r\npictorial papers caricatured its friends, the whole nation seemed to\r\nbe growing frantic over it. Meantime the Washington correspondents were\r\nsending such telegrams as these abroad in the land; Under date of--\r\n\r\nSATURDAY. \xe2\x80\x9cCongressmen Jex and Fluke are wavering; it is believed they\r\nwill desert the execrable bill.\xe2\x80\x9d MONDAY. \xe2\x80\x9cJex and Fluke have deserted!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n THURSDAY. \xe2\x80\x9cTubbs and Huffy left the sinking ship last night\xe2\x80\x9d Later on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree desertions. The University thieves are getting scared, though\r\nthey will not own it.\xe2\x80\x9d Later:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe leaders are growing stubborn--they swear they can carry it, but it\r\nis now almost certain that they no longer have a majority!\xe2\x80\x9d After a day\r\nor two of reluctant and ambiguous telegrams:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPublic sentiment seems changing, a trifle in favor of the bill--but\r\nonly a trifle.\xe2\x80\x9d And still later:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is whispered that the Hon. Mr. Trollop has gone over to the pirates.\r\nIt is probably a canard. Mr. Trollop has all along been the bravest and\r\nmost efficient champion of virtue and the people against the bill, and\r\nthe report is without doubt a shameless invention.\xe2\x80\x9d Next day:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith characteristic treachery, the truckling and pusillanimous reptile,\r\nCrippled-Speech Trollop, has gone over to the enemy. It is contended,\r\nnow, that he has been a friend to the bill, in secret, since the day\r\nit was introduced, and has had bankable reasons for being so; but he\r\nhimself declares that he has gone over because the malignant persecution\r\nof the bill by the newspapers caused him to study its provisions with\r\nmore care than he had previously done, and this close examination\r\nrevealed the fact that the measure is one in every way worthy of\r\nsupport. (Pretty thin!) It cannot be denied that this desertion has\r\nhad a damaging effect. Jex and Fluke have returned to their iniquitous\r\nallegiance, with six or eight others of lesser calibre, and it is\r\nreported and believed that Tubbs and Huffy are ready to go back. It is\r\nfeared that the University swindle is stronger to-day than it has ever\r\nbeen before.\xe2\x80\x9d Later-midnight:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is said that the committee will report the bill back to-morrow.\r\nBoth sides are marshaling their forces, and the fight on this bill is\r\nevidently going to be the hottest of the session.--All Washington is\r\nboiling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's easy enough for another fellow to talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry, despondingly,\r\nafter he had put Philip in possession of his view of the case. \xe2\x80\x9cIt's\r\neasy enough to say 'give her up,' if you don't care for her. What am I\r\ngoing to do to give her up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Harry that it was a situation requiring some active\r\nmeasures. He couldn't realize that he had fallen hopelessly in love\r\nwithout some rights accruing to him for the possession of the object\r\nof his passion. Quiet resignation under relinquishment of any thing\r\nhe wanted was not in his line. And when it appeared to him that his\r\nsurrender of Laura would be the withdrawal of the one barrier that kept\r\nher from ruin, it was unreasonable to expect that he could see how to\r\ngive her up.\r\n\r\nHarry had the most buoyant confidence in his own projects always; he saw\r\neverything connected with himself in a large way and in rosy lines. This\r\npredominance of the imagination over the judgment gave that appearance\r\nof exaggeration to his conversation and to his communications with\r\nregard to himself, which sometimes conveyed the impression that he was\r\nnot speaking the truth. His acquaintances had been known to say that\r\nthey invariably allowed a half for shrinkage in his statements, and held\r\nthe other half under advisement for confirmation.\r\n\r\nPhilip in this case could not tell from Harry's story exactly how much\r\nencouragement Laura had given him, nor what hopes he might justly have\r\nof winning her. He had never seen him desponding before. The \xe2\x80\x9cbrag\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n appeared to be all taken out of him, and his airy manner only asserted\r\nitself now and then in a comical imitation of its old self.\r\n\r\nPhilip wanted time to look about him before he decided what to do. He\r\nwas not familiar with Washington, and it was difficult to adjust his\r\nfeelings and perceptions to its peculiarities. Coming out of the sweet\r\nsanity of the Bolton household, this was by contrast the maddest\r\nVanity Fair one could conceive. It seemed to him a feverish, unhealthy\r\natmosphere in which lunacy would be easily developed. He fancied that\r\neverybody attached to himself an exaggerated importance, from the fact\r\nof being at the national capital, the center of political influence, the\r\nfountain of patronage, preferment, jobs and opportunities.\r\n\r\nPeople were introduced to each other as from this or that state, not\r\nfrom cities or towns, and this gave a largeness to their representative\r\nfeeling. All the women talked politics as naturally and glibly as they\r\ntalk fashion or literature elsewhere. There was always some exciting\r\ntopic at the Capitol, or some huge slander was rising up like a\r\nmiasmatic exhalation from the Potomac, threatening to settle no one knew\r\nexactly where. Every other person was an aspirant for a place, or, if\r\nhe had one, for a better place, or more pay; almost every other one\r\nhad some claim or interest or remedy to urge; even the women were\r\nall advocates for the advancement of some person, and they violently\r\nespoused or denounced this or that measure as it would affect some\r\nrelative, acquaintance or friend.\r\n\r\nLove, travel, even death itself, waited on the chances of the dies daily\r\nthrown in the two Houses, and the committee rooms there. If the measure\r\nwent through, love could afford to ripen into marriage, and longing for\r\nforeign travel would have fruition; and it must have been only eternal\r\nhope springing in the breast that kept alive numerous old claimants who\r\nfor years and years had besieged the doors of Congress, and who looked\r\nas if they needed not so much an appropriation of money as six feet of\r\nground. And those who stood so long waiting for success to bring them\r\ndeath were usually those who had a just claim.\r\n\r\nRepresenting states and talking of national and even international\r\naffairs, as familiarly as neighbors at home talk of poor crops and the\r\nextravagance of their ministers, was likely at first to impose upon\r\nPhilip as to the importance of the people gathered here.\r\n\r\nThere was a little newspaper editor from Phil's native town, the\r\nassistant on a Peddletonian weekly, who made his little annual joke\r\nabout the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst egg laid on our table,\xe2\x80\x9d and who was the menial of every\r\ntradesman in the village and under bonds to him for frequent \xe2\x80\x9cpuffs,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n except the undertaker, about whose employment he was recklessly\r\nfacetious. In Washington he was an important man, correspondent, and\r\nclerk of two house committees, a \xe2\x80\x9cworker\xe2\x80\x9d in politics, and a confident\r\ncritic of every woman and every man in Washington. He would be a consul\r\nno doubt by and by, at some foreign port, of the language of which he\r\nwas ignorant--though if ignorance of language were a qualification he\r\nmight have been a consul at home. His easy familiarity with great\r\nmen was beautiful to see, and when Philip learned what a tremendous\r\nunderground influence this little ignoramus had, he no longer wondered\r\nat the queer appointments and the queerer legislation.\r\n\r\nPhilip was not long in discovering that people in Washington did\r\nnot differ much from other people; they had the same meannesses,\r\ngenerosities, and tastes: A Washington boarding house had the odor of a\r\nboarding house the world over.\r\n\r\nCol. Sellers was as unchanged as any one Philip saw whom he had known\r\nelsewhere. Washington appeared to be the native element of this man. His\r\npretentions were equal to any he encountered there. He saw nothing in\r\nits society that equalled that of Hawkeye, he sat down to no table that\r\ncould not be unfavorably contrasted with his own at home; the most airy\r\nscheme inflated in the hot air of the capital only reached in magnitude\r\nsome of his lesser fancies, the by-play of his constructive imagination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe country is getting along very well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Philip, \xe2\x80\x9cbut our\r\npublic men are too timid. What we want is more money. I've told Boutwell\r\nso. Talk about basing the currency on gold; you might as well base it on\r\npork. Gold is only one product. Base it on everything! You've got to\r\ndo something for the West. How am I to move my crops? We must have\r\nimprovements. Grant's got the idea. We want a canal from the James River\r\nto the Mississippi. Government ought to build it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to get the Colonel off from these large themes when he\r\nwas once started, but Philip brought the conversation round to Laura and\r\nher reputation in the City.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI haven't noticed much. We've been so busy about this\r\nUniversity. It will make Laura rich with the rest of us, and she has\r\ndone nearly as much as if she were a man. She has great talent, and will\r\nmake a big match. I see the foreign ministers and that sort after her.\r\nYes, there is talk, always will be about a pretty woman so much in\r\npublic as she is. Tough stories come to me, but I put'em away. 'Taint\r\nlikely one of Si Hawkins's children would do that--for she is the same\r\nas a child of his. I told her, though, to go slow,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Colonel,\r\nas if that mysterious admonition from him would set everything right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know anything about a Col. Selby?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow all about him. Fine fellow. But he's got a wife; and I told him,\r\nas a friend, he'd better sheer off from Laura. I reckon he thought\r\nbetter of it and did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Philip was not long in learning the truth. Courted as Laura was by\r\na certain class and still admitted into society, that, nevertheless,\r\nbuzzed with disreputable stories about her, she had lost character with\r\nthe best people. Her intimacy with Selby was open gossip, and there were\r\nwinks and thrustings of the tongue in any group of men when she passed\r\nby. It was clear enough that Harry's delusion must be broken up, and\r\nthat no such feeble obstacle as his passion could interpose would turn\r\nLaura from her fate. Philip determined to see her, and put himself in\r\npossession of the truth, as he suspected it, in order to show Harry his\r\nfolly.\r\n\r\nLaura, after her last conversation with Harry, had a new sense of her\r\nposition. She had noticed before the signs of a change in manner towards\r\nher, a little less respect perhaps from men, and an avoidance by women.\r\nShe had attributed this latter partly to jealousy of her, for no one is\r\nwilling to acknowledge a fault in himself when a more agreeable motive\r\ncan be found for the estrangement of his acquaintances. But now, if\r\nsociety had turned on her, she would defy it. It was not in her nature\r\nto shrink. She knew she had been wronged, and she knew that she had no\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\nWhat she heard of Col. Selby's proposed departure alarmed her more than\r\nanything else, and she calmly determined that if he was deceiving her\r\nthe second time it should be the last. Let society finish the tragedy if\r\nit liked; she was indifferent what came after. At the first opportunity,\r\nshe charged Selby with his intention to abandon her. He unblushingly\r\ndenied it.\r\n\r\nHe had not thought of going to Europe. He had only been amusing himself\r\nwith Sellers' schemes. He swore that as soon as she succeeded with her\r\nbill, he would fly with her to any part of the world.\r\n\r\nShe did not quite believe him, for she saw that he feared her, and she\r\nbegan to suspect that his were the protestations of a coward to gain\r\ntime. But she showed him no doubts.\r\n\r\nShe only watched his movements day by day, and always held herself ready\r\nto act promptly.\r\n\r\nWhen Philip came into the presence of this attractive woman, he could\r\nnot realize that she was the subject of all the scandal he had heard.\r\nShe received him with quite the old Hawkeye openness and cordiality,\r\nand fell to talking at once of their little acquaintance there; and\r\nit seemed impossible that he could ever say to her what he had come\r\ndetermined to say. Such a man as Philip has only one standard by which\r\nto judge women.\r\n\r\nLaura recognized that fact no doubt. The better part of her woman's\r\nnature saw it. Such a man might, years ago, not now, have changed her\r\nnature, and made the issue of her life so different, even after her\r\ncruel abandonment. She had a dim feeling of this, and she would like now\r\nto stand well with him. The spark of truth and honor that was left in\r\nher was elicited by his presence. It was this influence that governed\r\nher conduct in this interview.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip in his direct manner, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom my friend Mr.\r\nBrierly. You are not ignorant of his feeling towards you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps you do not know, you who have so much admiration, how\r\nsincere and overmastering his love is for you?\xe2\x80\x9d Philip would not have\r\nspoken so plainly, if he had in mind anything except to draw from Laura\r\nsomething that would end Harry's passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is sincere love so rare, Mr. Sterling?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Laura, moving her\r\nfoot a little, and speaking with a shade of sarcasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not in Washington,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Philip,--tempted into a similar\r\ntone. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse my bluntness,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbut would the knowledge\r\nof his love; would his devotion, make any difference to you in your\r\nWashington life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn respect to what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Laura quickly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to others. I won't equivocate--to Col. Selby?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura's face flushed with anger, or shame; she looked steadily at Philip\r\nand began,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy what right, sir,--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the right of friendship,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Philip stoutly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may matter\r\nlittle to you. It is everything to him. He has a Quixotic notion that\r\nyou would turn back from what is before you for his sake. You cannot\r\nbe ignorant of what all the city is talking of.\xe2\x80\x9d Philip said this\r\ndeterminedly and with some bitterness.\r\n\r\nIt was a full minute before Laura spoke. Both had risen, Philip as if\r\nto go, and Laura in suppressed excitement. When she spoke her voice was\r\nvery unsteady, and she looked down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know. I perfectly understand what you mean. Mr. Brierly is\r\nnothing--simply nothing. He is a moth singed, that is all--the trifler\r\nwith women thought he was a wasp. I have no pity for him, not the least.\r\nYou may tell him not to make a fool of himself, and to keep away. I say\r\nthis on your account, not his. You are not like him. It is enough for me\r\nthat you want it so. Mr. Sterling,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued, looking up; and there\r\nwere tears in her eyes that contradicted the hardness of her language,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou might not pity him if you knew my history; perhaps you would not\r\nwonder at some things you hear. No; it is useless to ask me why it\r\nmust be so. You can't make a life over--society wouldn't let you if you\r\nwould--and mine must be lived as it is. There, sir, I'm not offended;\r\nbut it is useless for you to say anything more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip went away with his heart lightened about Harry, but profoundly\r\nsaddened by the glimpse of what this woman might have been. He told\r\nHarry all that was necessary of the conversation--she was bent on going\r\nher own way, he had not the ghost of a chance--he was a fool, she had\r\nsaid, for thinking he had.\r\n\r\nAnd Harry accepted it meekly, and made up his own mind that Philip\r\ndidn't know much about women.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nThe galleries of the House were packed, on the momentous day, not\r\nbecause the reporting of an important bill back by a committee was a\r\nthing to be excited about, if the bill were going to take the ordinary\r\ncourse afterward; it would be like getting excited over the empaneling\r\nof a coroner's jury in a murder case, instead of saving up one's\r\nemotions for the grander occasion of the hanging of the accused, two\r\nyears later, after all the tedious forms of law had been gone through\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nBut suppose you understand that this coroner's jury is going to turn out\r\nto be a vigilance committee in disguise, who will hear testimony for\r\nan hour and then hang the murderer on the spot? That puts a different\r\naspect upon the matter. Now it was whispered that the legitimate forms\r\nof procedure usual in the House, and which keep a bill hanging along for\r\ndays and even weeks, before it is finally passed upon, were going to\r\nbe overruled, in this case, and short work made of the measure; and so,\r\nwhat was beginning as a mere inquest might, turn out to be something\r\nvery different.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the day's business the Order of \xe2\x80\x9cReports of Committees\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n was finally reached and when the weary crowds heard that glad\r\nannouncement issue from the Speaker's lips they ceased to fret at the\r\ndragging delay, and plucked up spirit. The Chairman of the Committee\r\non Benevolent Appropriations rose and made his report, and just then a\r\nblue-uniformed brass-mounted little page put a note into his hand.\r\n\r\nIt was from Senator Dilworthy, who had appeared upon the floor of the\r\nHouse for a moment and flitted away again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody expects a grand assault in force; no doubt you believe, as I\r\ncertainly do, that it is the thing to do; we are strong, and everything\r\nis hot for the contest. Trollop's espousal of our cause has immensely\r\nhelped us and we grow in power constantly. Ten of the opposition were\r\ncalled away from town about noon,(but--so it is said--only for one day).\r\nSix others are sick, but expect to be about again tomorrow or next day,\r\na friend tells me. A bold onslaught is worth trying. Go for a suspension\r\nof the rules! You will find we can swing a two-thirds vote--I am\r\nperfectly satisfied of it. The Lord's truth will prevail.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cDILWORTHY. Mr. Buckstone had reported the bills from his\r\ncommittee, one by one, leaving the bill to the last. When the House had\r\nvoted upon the acceptance or rejection of the report upon all but it,\r\nand the question now being upon its disposal--Mr. Buckstone begged that\r\nthe House would give its attention to a few remarks which he desired to\r\nmake. His committee had instructed him to report the bill favorably;\r\nhe wished to explain the nature of the measure, and thus justify\r\nthe committee's action; the hostility roused by the press would\r\nthen disappear, and the bill would shine forth in its true and noble\r\ncharacter. He said that its provisions were simple. It incorporated the\r\nKnobs Industrial University, locating it in East Tennessee, declaring it\r\nopen to all persons without distinction of sex, color or religion, and\r\ncommitting its management to a board of perpetual trustees, with power\r\nto fill vacancies in their own number. It provided for the erection\r\nof certain buildings for the University, dormitories, lecture-halls,\r\nmuseums, libraries, laboratories, work-shops, furnaces, and mills. It\r\nprovided also for the purchase of sixty-five thousand acres of land,\r\n(fully described) for the purposes of the University, in the Knobs of\r\nEast Tennessee. And it appropriated [blank] dollars for the purchase of\r\nthe Land, which should be the property of the national trustees in trust\r\nfor the uses named.\r\n\r\nEvery effort had been made to secure the refusal of the whole amount\r\nof the property of the Hawkins heirs in the Knobs, some seventy-five\r\nthousand acres Mr. Buckstone said. But Mr. Washington Hawkins (one of\r\nthe heirs) objected. He was, indeed, very reluctant to sell any part of\r\nthe land at any price; and indeed--this reluctance was justifiable when\r\none considers how constantly and how greatly the property is rising in\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nWhat the South needed, continued Mr. Buckstone, was skilled labor.\r\nWithout that it would be unable to develop its mines, build its roads,\r\nwork to advantage and without great waste its fruitful land, establish\r\nmanufactures or enter upon a prosperous industrial career. Its laborers\r\nwere almost altogether unskilled. Change them into intelligent, trained\r\nworkmen, and you increased at once the capital, the resources of the\r\nentire south, which would enter upon a prosperity hitherto unknown. In\r\nfive years the increase in local wealth would not only reimburse the\r\ngovernment for the outlay in this appropriation, but pour untold wealth\r\ninto the treasury.\r\n\r\nThis was the material view, and the least important in the honorable\r\ngentleman's opinion. [Here he referred to some notes furnished him by\r\nSenator Dilworthy, and then continued.] God had given us the care of\r\nthese colored millions. What account should we render to Him of our\r\nstewardship? We had made them free. Should we leave them ignorant? We\r\nhad cast them upon their own resources. Should we leave them without\r\ntools? We could not tell what the intentions of Providence are in regard\r\nto these peculiar people, but our duty was plain. The Knobs Industrial\r\nUniversity would be a vast school of modern science and practice, worthy\r\nof a great nation. It would combine the advantages of Zurich, Freiburg,\r\nCreuzot and the Sheffield Scientific. Providence had apparently reserved\r\nand set apart the Knobs of East Tennessee for this purpose. What else\r\nwere they for? Was it not wonderful that for more than thirty years,\r\nover a generation, the choicest portion of them had remained in one\r\nfamily, untouched, as if, separated for some great use!\r\n\r\nIt might be asked why the government should buy this land, when it had\r\nmillions of acres, more than the railroad companies desired, which, it\r\nmight devote to this purpose? He answered, that the government had no\r\nsuch tract of land as this. It had nothing comparable to it for the\r\npurposes of the University: This was to be a school of mining, of\r\nengineering, of the working of metals, of chemistry, zoology, botany,\r\nmanufactures, agriculture, in short of all the complicated industries\r\nthat make a state great. There was no place for the location of such a\r\nschool like the Knobs of East Tennessee. The hills abounded in metals\r\nof all sorts, iron in all its combinations, copper, bismuth, gold and\r\nsilver in small quantities, platinum he believed, tin, aluminium; it\r\nwas covered with forests and strange plants; in the woods were found the\r\ncoon, the opossum, the fox, the deer and many other animals who roamed\r\nin the domain of natural history; coal existed in enormous quantity\r\nand no doubt oil; it was such a place for the practice of agricultural\r\nexperiments that any student who had been successful there would have an\r\neasy task in any other portion of the country.\r\n\r\nNo place offered equal facilities for experiments in mining, metallurgy,\r\nengineering. He expected to live to see the day, when the youth of the\r\nsouth would resort to its mines, its workshops, its laboratories,\r\nits furnaces and factories for practical instruction in all the great\r\nindustrial pursuits.\r\n\r\nA noisy and rather ill-natured debate followed, now, and lasted hour\r\nafter hour. The friends of the bill were instructed by the leaders to\r\nmake no effort to check it; it was deemed better strategy to tire\r\nout the opposition; it was decided to vote down every proposition to\r\nadjourn, and so continue the sitting into the night; opponents might\r\ndesert, then, one by one and weaken their party, for they had no\r\npersonal stake in the bill.\r\n\r\nSunset came, and still the fight went on; the gas was lit, the crowd\r\nin the galleries began to thin, but the contest continued; the crowd\r\nreturned, by and by, with hunger and thirst appeased, and aggravated the\r\nhungry and thirsty House by looking contented and comfortable; but\r\nstill the wrangle lost nothing of its bitterness. Recesses were\r\nmoved plaintively by the opposition, and invariably voted down by the\r\nUniversity army.\r\n\r\nAt midnight the House presented a spectacle calculated to interest a\r\nstranger. The great galleries were still thronged--though only with men,\r\nnow; the bright colors that had made them look like hanging gardens were\r\ngone, with the ladies. The reporters' gallery, was merely occupied by\r\none or two watchful sentinels of the quill-driving guild; the main body\r\ncared nothing for a debate that had dwindled to a mere vaporing of dull\r\nspeakers and now and then a brief quarrel over a point of order; but\r\nthere was an unusually large attendance of journalists in the reporters'\r\nwaiting-room, chatting, smoking, and keeping on the 'qui vive' for the\r\ngeneral irruption of the Congressional volcano that must come when\r\nthe time was ripe for it. Senator Dilworthy and Philip were in the\r\nDiplomatic Gallery; Washington sat in the public gallery, and Col.\r\nSellers was, not far away. The Colonel had been flying about the\r\ncorridors and button-holing Congressmen all the evening, and believed\r\nthat he had accomplished a world of valuable service; but fatigue was\r\ntelling upon him, now, and he was quiet and speechless--for once. Below,\r\na few Senators lounged upon the sofas set apart for visitors, and talked\r\nwith idle Congressmen. A dreary member was speaking; the presiding\r\nofficer was nodding; here and there little knots of members stood in the\r\naisles, whispering together; all about the House others sat in all the\r\nvarious attitudes that express weariness; some, tilted back, had one or\r\nmore legs disposed upon their desks; some sharpened pencils indolently;\r\nsome scribbled aimlessly; some yawned and stretched; a great many lay\r\nupon their breasts upon the desks, sound asleep and gently snoring. The\r\nflooding gaslight from the fancifully wrought roof poured down upon\r\nthe tranquil scene. Hardly a sound disturbed the stillness, save the\r\nmonotonous eloquence of the gentleman who occupied the floor. Now and\r\nthen a warrior of the opposition broke down under the pressure, gave it\r\nup, and went home.\r\n\r\nMr. Buckstone began to think it might be safe, now, to \xe2\x80\x9cproceed to\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d He consulted with Trollop and one or two others. Senator\r\nDilworthy descended to the floor of the House and they went to meet him.\r\nAfter a brief comparison of notes, the Congressmen sought their seats\r\nand sent pages about the House with messages to friends. These latter\r\ninstantly roused up, yawned, and began to look alert. The moment the\r\nfloor was unoccupied, Mr. Buckstone rose, with an injured look, and\r\nsaid it was evident that the opponents of the bill were merely talking\r\nagainst time, hoping in this unbecoming way to tire out the friends of\r\nthe measure and so defeat it. Such conduct might be respectable enough\r\nin a village debating society, but it was trivial among statesmen,\r\nit was out of place in so august an assemblage as the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the United States. The friends of the bill had been\r\nnot only willing that its opponents should express their opinions, but\r\nhad strongly desired it. They courted the fullest and freest discussion;\r\nbut it seemed to him that this fairness was but illy appreciated,\r\nsince gentlemen were capable of taking advantage of it for selfish and\r\nunworthy ends. This trifling had gone far enough. He called for the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe instant Mr. Buckstone sat down, the storm burst forth. A dozen\r\ngentlemen sprang to their feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Speaker!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Speaker!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Speaker!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOrder! Order! Order! Question! Question!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sharp blows of the Speaker's gavel rose above the din.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cprevious question,\xe2\x80\x9d that hated gag, was moved and carried. All\r\ndebate came to a sudden end, of course. Triumph No. 1.\r\n\r\nThen the vote was taken on the adoption of the report and it carried by\r\na surprising majority.\r\n\r\nMr. Buckstone got the floor again and moved that the rules be suspended\r\nand the bill read a first time.\r\n\r\nMr. Trollop--\xe2\x80\x9cSecond the motion!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Speaker--\xe2\x80\x9cIt is moved and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClamor of Voices. \xe2\x80\x9cMove we adjourn! Second the motion! Adjourn! Adjourn!\r\nOrder! Order!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Speaker, (after using his gavel vigorously)--\xe2\x80\x9cIt is moved and\r\nseconded that the House do now adjourn. All those in favor--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVoices--\xe2\x80\x9cDivision! Division! Ayes and nays! Ayes and nays!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was decided to vote upon the adjournment by ayes and nays. This was\r\nin earnest. The excitement was furious. The galleries were in commotion\r\nin an instant, the reporters swarmed to their places. Idling members\r\nof the House flocked to their seats, nervous gentlemen sprang to their\r\nfeet, pages flew hither and thither, life and animation were visible\r\neverywhere, all the long ranks of faces in the building were kindled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis thing decides it!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Mr. Buckstone; \xe2\x80\x9cbut let the fight\r\nproceed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe voting began, and every sound ceased but the calling if the names\r\nand the \xe2\x80\x9cAye!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAye!\xe2\x80\x9d of the responses. There was not a\r\nmovement in the House; the people seemed to hold their breath.\r\n\r\nThe voting ceased, and then there was an interval of dead silence\r\nwhile the clerk made up his count. There was a two-thirds vote on the\r\nUniversity side--and two over.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker--\xe2\x80\x9cThe rules are suspended, the motion is carried--first\r\nreading of the bill!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy one impulse the galleries broke forth into stormy applause, and even\r\nsome of the members of the House were not wholly able to restrain their\r\nfeelings. The Speaker's gavel came to the rescue and his clear voice\r\nfollowed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOrder, gentlemen--! The House will come to order! If spectators offend\r\nagain, the Sergeant-at-arms will clear the galleries!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he cast his eyes aloft and gazed at some object attentively for a\r\nmoment. All eyes followed the direction of the Speaker's, and then there\r\nwas a general titter. The Speaker said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the Sergeant-at Arms inform the gentleman that his conduct is an\r\ninfringement of the dignity of the House--and one which is not warranted\r\nby the state of the weather.\xe2\x80\x9d Poor Sellers was the culprit. He sat\r\nin the front seat of the gallery, with his arms and his tired body\r\noverflowing the balustrade--sound asleep, dead to all excitements, all\r\ndisturbances. The fluctuations of the Washington weather had influenced\r\nhis dreams, perhaps, for during the recent tempest of applause he had\r\nhoisted his gingham umbrella, and calmly gone on with his slumbers.\r\nWashington Hawkins had seen the act, but was not near enough at hand\r\nto save his friend, and no one who was near enough desired to spoil the\r\neffect. But a neighbor stirred up the Colonel, now that the House had\r\nits eye upon him, and the great speculator furled his tent like the\r\nArab. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless my soul, I'm so absent-minded when I get to thinking! I never\r\nwear an umbrella in the house--did anybody 'notice it'? What-asleep?\r\nIndeed? And did you wake me sir? Thank you--thank you very much indeed.\r\nIt might have fallen out of my hands and been injured. Admirable\r\narticle, sir--present from a friend in Hong Kong; one doesn't come\r\nacross silk like that in this country--it's the real--Young Hyson, I'm\r\ntold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time the incident was forgotten, for the House was at war again.\r\nVictory was almost in sight, now, and the friends of the bill threw\r\nthemselves into their work with enthusiasm. They soon moved and carried\r\nits second reading, and after a strong, sharp fight, carried a motion to\r\ngo into Committee of the whole. The Speaker left his place, of course,\r\nand a chairman was appointed.\r\n\r\nNow the contest raged hotter than ever--for the authority that compels\r\norder when the House sits as a House, is greatly diminished when it sits\r\nas Committee. The main fight came upon the filling of the blanks with\r\nthe sum to be appropriated for the purchase of the land, of course.\r\n\r\nBuckstone--\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Chairman, I move you, sir, that the words 'three\r\nmillions of' be inserted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Hadley--\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Chairman, I move that the words two and a half dollars\r\nbe inserted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Clawson--\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Chairman, I move the insertion of the words five and\r\ntwenty cents, as representing the true value of this barren and isolated\r\ntract of desolation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question, according to rule, was taken upon the smallest sum first.\r\nIt was lost.\r\n\r\nThen upon the next smallest sum. Lost, also.\r\n\r\nAnd then upon the three millions. After a vigorous battle that lasted a\r\nconsiderable time, this motion was carried.\r\n\r\nThen, clause by clause the bill was read, discussed, and amended in\r\ntrifling particulars, and now the Committee rose and reported.\r\n\r\nThe moment the House had resumed its functions and received the report,\r\nMr. Buckstone moved and carried the third reading of the bill.\r\n\r\nThe same bitter war over the sum to be paid was fought over again, and\r\nnow that the ayes and nays could be called and placed on record, every\r\nman was compelled to vote by name on the three millions, and indeed on\r\nevery paragraph of the bill from the enacting clause straight through.\r\nBut as before, the friends of the measure stood firm and voted in a\r\nsolid body every time, and so did its enemies.\r\n\r\nThe supreme moment was come, now, but so sure was the result that not\r\neven a voice was raised to interpose an adjournment. The enemy were\r\ntotally demoralized. The bill was put upon its final passage almost\r\nwithout dissent, and the calling of the ayes and nays began. When it\r\nwas ended the triumph was complete--the two-thirds vote held good, and a\r\nveto was impossible, as far as the House was concerned!\r\n\r\nMr. Buckstone resolved that now that the nail was driven home, he\r\nwould clinch it on the other side and make it stay forever. He moved a\r\nreconsideration of the vote by which the bill had passed. The motion\r\nwas lost, of course, and the great Industrial University act was\r\nan accomplished fact as far as it was in the power of the House of\r\nRepresentatives to make it so.\r\n\r\nThere was no need to move an adjournment. The instant the last motion\r\nwas decided, the enemies of the University rose and flocked out of the\r\nHall, talking angrily, and its friends flocked after them jubilant and\r\ncongratulatory. The galleries disgorged their burden, and presently the\r\nhouse was silent and deserted.\r\n\r\nWhen Col. Sellers and Washington stepped out of the building they were\r\nsurprised to find that the daylight was old and the sun well up. Said\r\nthe Colonel:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your hand, my boy! You're all right at last! You're a\r\nmillionaire! At least you're going to be. The thing is dead sure. Don't\r\nyou bother about the Senate. Leave me and Dilworthy to take care of\r\nthat. Run along home, now, and tell Laura. Lord, it's magnificent\r\nnews--perfectly magnificent! Run, now. I'll telegraph my wife. She must\r\ncome here and help me build a house. Everything's all right now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington was so dazed by his good fortune and so bewildered by the\r\ngaudy pageant of dreams that was already trailing its long ranks through\r\nhis brain, that he wandered he knew not where, and so loitered by the\r\nway that when at last he reached home he woke to a sudden annoyance in\r\nthe fact that his news must be old to Laura, now, for of course Senator\r\nDilworthy must have already been home and told her an hour before. He\r\nknocked at her door, but there was no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is like the Duchess,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cAlways cool; a body can't excite\r\nher-can't keep her excited, anyway. Now she has gone off to sleep again,\r\nas comfortably as if she were used to picking up a million dollars every\r\nday or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he went to bed. But he could not sleep; so he got up and wrote\r\na long, rapturous letter to Louise, and another to his mother. And he\r\nclosed both to much the same effect:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaura will be queen of America, now, and she will be applauded, and\r\nhonored and petted by the whole nation. Her name will be in every one's\r\nmouth more than ever, and how they will court her and quote her bright\r\nspeeches. And mine, too, I suppose; though they do that more already,\r\nthan they really seem to deserve. Oh, the world is so bright, now, and\r\nso cheery; the clouds are all gone, our long struggle is ended, our\r\ntroubles are all over. Nothing can ever make us unhappy any more. You\r\ndear faithful ones will have the reward of your patient waiting now. How\r\nfather's Wisdom is proven at last! And how I repent me, that there have\r\nbeen times when I lost faith and said, the blessing he stored up for us\r\na tedious generation ago was but a long-drawn curse, a blight upon us\r\nall. But everything is well, now--we are done with poverty, sad toil,\r\nweariness and heart-break; all the world is filled with sunshine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 6.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI Disappearance of Laura, and Murder of Col.

It was a bright spring morning, the air was soft\r\nand inspiring; in the deepening wayside green, the pink flush of the\r\nblossoming peach trees, the soft suffusion on the heights of Arlington,\r\nand the breath of the warm south wind was apparent, the annual miracle\r\nof the resurrection of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe Senator took off his hat and seemed to open his soul to the sweet\r\ninfluences of the morning. After the heat and noise of the chamber,\r\nunder its dull gas-illuminated glass canopy, and the all night struggle\r\nof passion and feverish excitement there, the open, tranquil world\r\nseemed like Heaven. The Senator was not in an exultant mood, but rather\r\nin a condition of holy joy, befitting a Christian statesman whose\r\nbenevolent plans Providence has made its own and stamped with approval.\r\nThe great battle had been fought, but the measure had still to encounter\r\nthe scrutiny of the Senate, and Providence sometimes acts differently in\r\nthe two Houses. Still the Senator was tranquil, for he knew that there\r\nis an esprit de corps in the Senate which does not exist in the House,\r\nthe effect of which is to make the members complaisant towards the\r\nprojects of each other, and to extend a mutual aid which in a more\r\nvulgar body would be called \xe2\x80\x9clog-rolling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, under Providence, a good night's work, Mr. Sterling. The\r\ngovernment has founded an institution which will remove half the\r\ndifficulty from the southern problem. And it is a good thing for the\r\nHawkins heirs, a very good thing. Laura will be almost a millionaire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think, Mr. Dilworthy, that the Hawkinses will get much of the\r\nmoney?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip innocently, remembering the fate of the Columbus\r\nRiver appropriation.\r\n\r\nThe Senator looked at his companion scrutinizingly for a moment to see\r\nif he meant anything personal, and then replied,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly, undoubtedly. I have had their interests greatly at heart.\r\nThere will of course be a few expenses, but the widow and orphans will\r\nrealize all that Mr. Hawkins, dreamed of for them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe birds were singing as they crossed the Presidential Square, now\r\nbright with its green turf and tender foliage. After the two had gained\r\nthe steps of the Senator's house they stood a moment, looking upon the\r\nlovely prospect:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is like the peace of God,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Senator devoutly.\r\n\r\nEntering the house, the Senator called a servant and said, \xe2\x80\x9cTell Miss\r\nLaura that we are waiting to see her. I ought to have sent a messenger\r\non horseback half an hour ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he added to Philip, \xe2\x80\x9cshe will be\r\ntransported with our victory. You must stop to breakfast, and see the\r\nexcitement.\xe2\x80\x9d The servant soon came back, with a wondering look and\r\nreported,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Laura ain't dah, sah. I reckon she hain't been dah all night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Senator and Philip both started up. In Laura's room there were\r\nthe marks of a confused and hasty departure, drawers half open, little\r\narticles strewn on the floor. The bed had not been disturbed. Upon\r\ninquiry it appeared that Laura had not been at dinner, excusing herself\r\nto Mrs. Dilworthy on the plea of a violent headache; that she made a\r\nrequest to the servants that she might not be disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe Senator was astounded. Philip thought at once of Col. Selby. Could\r\nLaura have run away with him? The Senator thought not. In fact it could\r\nnot be. Gen. Leffenwell, the member from New Orleans, had casually told\r\nhim at the house last night that Selby and his family went to New York\r\nyesterday morning and were to sail for Europe to-day.\r\n\r\nPhilip had another idea which, he did not mention. He seized his hat,\r\nand saying that he would go and see what he could learn, ran to the\r\nlodgings of Harry; whom he had not seen since yesterday afternoon, when\r\nhe left him to go to the House.\r\n\r\nHarry was not in. He had gone out with a hand-bag before six o'clock\r\nyesterday, saying that he had to go to New York, but should return next\r\nday. In Harry's-room on the table Philip found this note:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Mr. Brierly:--Can you meet me at the six o'clock train, and be my\r\nescort to New York? I have to go about this University bill, the vote of\r\nan absent member we must have here, Senator Dilworthy cannot go.\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yours, L. H.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillip, \xe2\x80\x9cthe noodle has fallen into her trap. And\r\nshe promised she would let him alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe only stopped to send a note to Senator Dilworthy, telling him what he\r\nhad found, and that he should go at once to New York, and then hastened\r\nto the railway station. He had to wait an hour for a train, and when it\r\ndid start it seemed to go at a snail's pace.\r\n\r\nPhilip was devoured with anxiety. Where could they have gone? What\r\nwas Laura's object in taking Harry? Had the flight anything to do with\r\nSelby? Would Harry be such a fool as to be dragged into some public\r\nscandal?\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the train would never reach Baltimore. Then there was a\r\nlong delay at Havre de Grace. A hot box had to be cooled at Wilmington.\r\nWould it never get on? Only in passing around the city of Philadelphia\r\ndid the train not seem to go slow. Philip stood upon the platform and\r\nwatched for the Boltons' house, fancied he could distinguish its roof\r\namong the trees, and wondered how Ruth would feel if she knew he was so\r\nnear her.\r\n\r\nThen came Jersey, everlasting Jersey, stupid irritating Jersey, where\r\nthe passengers are always asking which line they are on, and where they\r\nare to come out, and whether they have yet reached Elizabeth. Launched\r\ninto Jersey, one has a vague notion that he is on many lines and no one\r\nin particular, and that he is liable at any moment to come to Elizabeth.\r\nHe has no notion what Elizabeth is, and always resolves that the next\r\ntime he goes that way, he will look out of the window and see what it\r\nis like; but he never does. Or if he does, he probably finds that it is\r\nPrinceton or something of that sort. He gets annoyed, and never can\r\nsee the use of having different names for stations in Jersey. By and by\r\nthere is Newark, three or four Newarks apparently; then marshes; then\r\nlong rock cuttings devoted to the advertisements of patent medicines and\r\nready-made, clothing, and New York tonics for Jersey agues, and Jersey\r\nCity is reached.\r\n\r\nOn the ferry-boat Philip bought an evening paper from a boy crying\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Ere's the Evening Gram, all about the murder,\xe2\x80\x9d and with breathless\r\nhaste--ran his eyes over the following:\r\n\r\nSHOCKING MURDER!!!\r\n\r\nTRAGEDY IN HIGH LIFE!!\r\n\r\nA BEAUTIFUL WOMAN SHOOTS A DISTINGUISHED\r\n\r\nCONFEDERATE SOLDIER AT THE SOUTHERN HOTEL!!!\r\n\r\nJEALOUSY THE CAUSE!!!\r\n\r\nThis morning occurred another of those shocking murders which have\r\nbecome the almost daily food of the newspapers, the direct result of\r\nthe socialistic doctrines and woman's rights agitations, which have made\r\nevery woman the avenger of her own wrongs, and all society the hunting\r\nground for her victims.\r\n\r\nAbout nine o'clock a lady deliberately shot a man dead in the public\r\nparlor of the Southern Hotel, coolly remarking, as she threw down her\r\nrevolver and permitted herself to be taken into custody, \xe2\x80\x9cHe brought it\r\non himself.\xe2\x80\x9d Our reporters were immediately dispatched to the scene of\r\nthe tragedy, and gathered the following particulars.\r\n\r\nYesterday afternoon arrived at the hotel from Washington, Col. George\r\nSelby and family, who had taken passage and were to sail at noon to-day\r\nin the steamer Scotia for England. The Colonel was a handsome man about\r\nforty, a gentleman of wealth and high social position, a resident of\r\nNew Orleans. He served with distinction in the confederate army, and\r\nreceived a wound in the leg from which he has never entirely recovered,\r\nbeing obliged to use a cane in locomotion.\r\n\r\nThis morning at about nine o'clock, a lady, accompanied by a gentleman,\r\ncalled at the office of the hotel and asked for Col. Selby. The Colonel\r\nwas at breakfast. Would the clerk tell him that a lady and gentleman\r\nwished to see him for a moment in the parlor? The clerk says that the\r\ngentleman asked her, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want to see him for?\xe2\x80\x9d and that she\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is going to Europe, and I ought to just say good by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCol. Selby was informed; and the lady and gentleman were shown to the\r\nparlor, in which were at the time three or four other persons. Five\r\nminutes after two shots were fired in quick succession, and there was a\r\nrush to the parlor from which the reports came.\r\n\r\nCol. Selby was found lying on the floor, bleeding, but not dead. Two\r\ngentlemen, who had just come in, had seized the lady, who made no\r\nresistance, and she was at once given in charge of a police officer who\r\narrived. The persons who were in the parlor agree substantially as to\r\nwhat occurred. They had happened to be looking towards the door when the\r\nman--Col. Selby--entered with his cane, and they looked at him, because\r\nhe stopped as if surprised and frightened, and made a backward movement.\r\nAt the same moment the lady in the bonnet advanced towards him and said\r\nsomething like, \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge, will you go with me?\xe2\x80\x9d He replied, throwing\r\nup his hand and retreating, \xe2\x80\x9cMy God I can't, don't fire,\xe2\x80\x9d and the next\r\ninstants two shots were heard and he fell. The lady appeared to be\r\nbeside herself with rage or excitement, and trembled very much when the\r\ngentlemen took hold of her; it was to them she said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe brought it on\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCol. Selby was carried at once to his room and Dr. Puffer, the eminent\r\nsurgeon was sent for. It was found that he was shot through the breast\r\nand through the abdomen. Other aid was summoned, but the wounds were\r\nmortal, and Col Selby expired in an hour, in pain, but his mind was\r\nclear to the last and he made a full deposition. The substance of it\r\nwas that his murderess is a Miss Laura Hawkins, whom he had known\r\nat Washington as a lobbyist and had some business with her. She had\r\nfollowed him with her attentions and solicitations, and had endeavored\r\nto make him desert his wife and go to Europe with her. When he resisted\r\nand avoided her she had threatened him. Only the day before he left\r\nWashington she had declared that he should never go out of the city\r\nalive without her.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been a deliberate and premeditated murder, the woman\r\nfollowing him to Washington on purpose to commit it.\r\n\r\nWe learn that the murderess, who is a woman of dazzling and transcendent\r\nbeauty and about twenty six or seven, is a niece of Senator Dilworthy\r\nat whose house she has been spending the winter. She belongs to a high\r\nSouthern family, and has the reputation of being an heiress. Like some\r\nother great beauties and belles in Washington however there have been\r\nwhispers that she had something to do with the lobby. If we mistake\r\nnot we have heard her name mentioned in connection with the sale of the\r\nTennessee Lands to the Knobs University, the bill for which passed the\r\nHouse last night.\r\n\r\nHer companion is Mr. Harry Brierly, a New York dandy, who has been in\r\nWashington. His connection with her and with this tragedy is not known,\r\nbut he was also taken into custody, and will be detained at least as a\r\nwitness.\r\n\r\nP. S. One of the persons present in the parlor says that after Laura\r\nHawkins had fired twice, she turned the pistol towards herself, but that\r\nBrierly sprung and caught it from her hand, and that it was he who threw\r\nit on the floor.\r\n\r\nFurther particulars with full biographies of all the parties in our next\r\nedition. Philip hastened at once to the Southern Hotel, where he\r\nfound still a great state of excitement, and a thousand different and\r\nexaggerated stories passing from mouth to mouth. The witnesses of the\r\nevent had told it over so many times that they had worked it up into a\r\nmost dramatic scene, and embellished it with whatever could heighten its\r\nawfulness. Outsiders had taken up invention also. The Colonel's wife\r\nhad gone insane, they said. The children had rushed into the parlor and\r\nrolled themselves in their father's blood. The hotel clerk said that he\r\nnoticed there was murder in the woman's eye when he saw her. A person\r\nwho had met the woman on the stairs felt a creeping sensation. Some\r\nthought Brierly was an accomplice, and that he had set the woman on to\r\nkill his rival. Some said the woman showed the calmness and indifference\r\nof insanity.\r\n\r\nPhilip learned that Harry and Laura had both been taken to the city\r\nprison, and he went there; but he was not admitted. Not being a\r\nnewspaper reporter, he could not see either of them that night; but the\r\nofficer questioned him suspiciously and asked him who he was. He might\r\nperhaps see Brierly in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe latest editions of the evening papers had the result of the inquest.\r\nIt was a plain enough case for the jury, but they sat over it a long\r\ntime, listening to the wrangling of the physicians. Dr. Puffer insisted\r\nthat the man died from the effects of the wound in the chest. Dr. Dobb\r\nas strongly insisted that the wound in the abdomen caused death. Dr.\r\nGolightly suggested that in his opinion death ensued from a complication\r\nof the two wounds and perhaps other causes. He examined the table\r\nwaiter, as to whether Col. Selby ate any breakfast, and what he ate, and\r\nif he had any appetite.\r\n\r\nThe jury finally threw themselves back upon the indisputable fact that\r\nSelby was dead, that either wound would have killed him (admitted by the\r\ndoctors), and rendered a verdict that he died from pistol-shot wounds\r\ninflicted by a pistol in the hands of Laura Hawkins.\r\n\r\nThe morning papers blazed with big type, and overflowed with details of\r\nthe murder. The accounts in the evening papers were only the premonitory\r\ndrops to this mighty shower. The scene was dramatically worked up in\r\ncolumn after column. There were sketches, biographical and historical.\r\nThere were long \xe2\x80\x9cspecials\xe2\x80\x9d from Washington, giving a full history of\r\nLaura's career there, with the names of men with whom she was said to\r\nbe intimate, a description of Senator Dilworthy's residence and of his\r\nfamily, and of Laura's room in his house, and a sketch of the Senator's\r\nappearance and what he said. There was a great deal about her beauty,\r\nher accomplishments and her brilliant position in society, and her\r\ndoubtful position in society. There was also an interview with Col.\r\nSellers and another with Washington Hawkins, the brother of the\r\nmurderess. One journal had a long dispatch from Hawkeye, reporting\r\nthe excitement in that quiet village and the reception of the awful\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nAll the parties had been \xe2\x80\x9cinterviewed.\xe2\x80\x9d There were reports of\r\nconversations with the clerk at the hotel; with the call-boy; with the\r\nwaiter at table with all the witnesses, with the policeman, with the\r\nlandlord (who wanted it understood that nothing of that sort had ever\r\nhappened in his house before, although it had always been frequented\r\nby the best Southern society,) and with Mrs. Col. Selby. There were\r\ndiagrams illustrating the scene of the shooting, and views of the hotel\r\nand street, and portraits of the parties.\r\n\r\nThere were three minute and different statements from the doctors about\r\nthe wounds, so technically worded that nobody could understand them.\r\nHarry and Laura had also been \xe2\x80\x9cinterviewed\xe2\x80\x9d and there was a statement\r\nfrom Philip himself, which a reporter had knocked him up out of bed\r\nat midnight to give, though how he found him, Philip never could\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\nWhat some of the journals lacked in suitable length for the occasion,\r\nthey made up in encyclopaedic information about other similar murders\r\nand shootings.\r\n\r\nThe statement from Laura was not full, in fact it was fragmentary, and\r\nconsisted of nine parts of, the reporter's valuable observations to\r\none of Laura's, and it was, as the reporter significantly remarked,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cincoherent\xe2\x80\x9d, but it appeared that Laura claimed to be Selby's wife, or\r\nto have been his wife, that he had deserted her and betrayed her, and\r\nthat she was going to follow him to Europe. When the reporter asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat made you shoot him, Miss Hawkins?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura's only reply was, very simply,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I shoot him? Do they say I shot him?\xe2\x80\x9d. And she would say no more.\r\n\r\nThe news of the murder was made the excitement of the day. Talk of it\r\nfilled the town. The facts reported were scrutinized, the standing of\r\nthe parties was discussed, the dozen different theories of the motive,\r\nbroached in the newspapers, were disputed over.\r\n\r\nDuring the night subtle electricity had carried the tale over all the\r\nwires of the continent and under the sea; and in all villages and towns\r\nof the Union, from the Atlantic to the territories, and away up and\r\ndown the Pacific slope, and as far as London and Paris and Berlin, that\r\nmorning the name of Laura Hawkins was spoken by millions and millions\r\nof people, while the owner of it--the sweet child of years ago, the\r\nbeautiful queen of Washington drawing rooms--sat shivering on her\r\ncot-bed in the darkness of a damp cell in the Tombs.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nPhilip's first effort was to get Harry out of the Tombs. He gained\r\npermission to see him, in the presence of an officer, during the day,\r\nand he found that hero very much cast down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never intended to come to such a place as this, old fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said\r\nto Philip; \xe2\x80\x9cit's no place for a gentleman, they've no idea how to treat\r\na gentleman. Look at that provender,\xe2\x80\x9d pointing to his uneaten prison\r\nration. \xe2\x80\x9cThey tell me I am detained as a witness, and I passed the night\r\namong a lot of cut-throats and dirty rascals--a pretty witness I'd be in\r\na month spent in such company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what under heavens,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip, \xe2\x80\x9cinduced you to come to New York\r\nwith Laura! What was it for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for? Why, she wanted me to come. I didn't know anything about that\r\ncursed Selby. She said it was lobby business for the University. I'd no\r\nidea what she was dragging me into that confounded hotel for. I suppose\r\nshe knew that the Southerners all go there, and thought she'd find her\r\nman. Oh! Lord, I wish I'd taken your advice. You might as well murder\r\nsomebody and have the credit of it, as get into the newspapers the way I\r\nhave. She's pure devil, that girl. You ought to have seen how sweet she\r\nwas on me; what an ass I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I'm not going to dispute a poor prisoner. But the first thing is\r\nto get you out of this. I've brought the note Laura wrote you, for one\r\nthing, and I've seen your uncle, and explained the truth of the case to\r\nhim. He will be here soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry's uncle came, with other friends, and in the course of the day\r\nmade such a showing to the authorities that Harry was released, on\r\ngiving bonds to appear as a witness when wanted. His spirits rose with\r\ntheir usual elasticity as soon as he was out of Centre Street, and he\r\ninsisted on giving Philip and his friends a royal supper at Delmonico's,\r\nan excess which was perhaps excusable in the rebound of his feelings,\r\nand which was committed with his usual reckless generosity. Harry\r\nordered the supper, and it is perhaps needless to say that Philip paid\r\nthe bill.\r\n\r\nNeither of the young men felt like attempting to see Laura that day, and\r\nshe saw no company except the newspaper reporters, until the arrival of\r\nCol. Sellers and Washington Hawkins, who had hastened to New York with\r\nall speed.\r\n\r\nThey found Laura in a cell in the upper tier of the women's department.\r\nThe cell was somewhat larger than those in the men's department, and\r\nmight be eight feet by ten square, perhaps a little longer. It was of\r\nstone, floor and all, and tile roof was oven shaped. A narrow slit\r\nin the roof admitted sufficient light, and was the only means of\r\nventilation; when the window was opened there was nothing to prevent the\r\nrain coming in. The only means of heating being from the corridor, when\r\nthe door was ajar, the cell was chilly and at this time damp. It was\r\nwhitewashed and clean, but it had a slight jail odor; its only furniture\r\nwas a narrow iron bedstead, with a tick of straw and some blankets, not\r\ntoo clean.\r\n\r\nWhen Col. Sellers was conducted to this cell by the matron and looked\r\nin, his emotions quite overcame him, the tears rolled down his cheeks\r\nand his voice trembled so that he could hardly speak. Washington was\r\nunable to say anything; he looked from Laura to the miserable creatures\r\nwho were walking in the corridor with unutterable disgust. Laura was\r\nalone calm and self-contained, though she was not unmoved by the sight\r\nof the grief of her friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you comfortable, Laura?\xe2\x80\x9d was the first word the Colonel could get\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI can't say it's exactly comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you cold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is pretty chilly. The stone floor is like ice. It chills me through\r\nto step on it. I have to sit on the bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor thing, poor thing. And can you eat any thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am not hungry. I don't know that I could eat any thing, I can't\r\neat that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Colonel, \xe2\x80\x9cit's dreadful. But cheer up, dear,\r\ncheer up;\xe2\x80\x9d and the Colonel broke down entirely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwe'll stand by you. We'll do everything for you. I\r\nknow you couldn't have meant to do it, it must have been insanity, you\r\nknow, or something of that sort. You never did anything of the sort\r\nbefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura smiled very faintly and said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was something of that sort. It's all a whirl. He was a villain;\r\nyou don't know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd rather have killed him myself, in a duel you know, all fair. I\r\nwish I had. But don't you be down. We'll get you the best counsel, the\r\nlawyers in New York can do anything; I've read of cases. But you must be\r\ncomfortable now. We've brought some of your clothes, at the hotel. What\r\nelse, can we get for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura suggested that she would like some sheets for her bed, a piece\r\nof carpet to step on, and her meals sent in; and some books and writing\r\nmaterials if it was allowed. The Colonel and Washington promised to\r\nprocure all these things, and then took their sorrowful leave, a great\r\ndeal more affected than the criminal was, apparently, by her situation.\r\n\r\nThe colonel told the matron as he went away that if she would look to\r\nLaura's comfort a little it shouldn't be the worse for her; and to the\r\nturnkey who let them out he patronizingly said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou've got a big establishment here, a credit to the city. I've got a\r\nfriend in there--I shall see you again, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy the next day something more of Laura's own story began to appear in\r\nthe newspapers, colored and heightened by reporters' rhetoric. Some of\r\nthem cast a lurid light upon the Colonel's career, and represented his\r\nvictim as a beautiful avenger of her murdered innocence; and others\r\npictured her as his willing paramour and pitiless slayer. Her\r\ncommunications to the reporters were stopped by her lawyers as soon as\r\nthey were retained and visited her, but this fact did not prevent--it\r\nmay have facilitated--the appearance of casual paragraphs here and there\r\nwhich were likely to beget popular sympathy for the poor girl.\r\n\r\nThe occasion did not pass without \xe2\x80\x9cimprovement\xe2\x80\x9d by the leading journals;\r\nand Philip preserved the editorial comments of three or four of them\r\nwhich pleased him most. These he used to read aloud to his friends\r\nafterwards and ask them to guess from which journal each of them had\r\nbeen cut. One began in this simple manner:--\r\n\r\nHistory never repeats itself, but the Kaleidoscopic combinations of\r\nthe pictured present often seem to be constructed out of the broken\r\nfragments of antique legends. Washington is not Corinth, and Lais, the\r\nbeautiful daughter of Timandra, might not have been the prototype of\r\nthe ravishing Laura, daughter of the plebeian house of Hawkins; but the\r\norators add statesmen who were the purchasers of the favors of the one,\r\nmay have been as incorruptible as the Republican statesmen who learned\r\nhow to love and how to vote from the sweet lips of the Washington\r\nlobbyist; and perhaps the modern Lais would never have departed from the\r\nnational Capital if there had been there even one republican Xenocrates\r\nwho resisted her blandishments. But here the parallel: fails. Lais,\r\nwandering away with the youth Rippostratus, is slain by the women who\r\nare jealous of her charms. Laura, straying into her Thessaly with the\r\nyouth Brierly, slays her other lover and becomes the champion of the\r\nwrongs of her sex. Another journal began its editorial with less lyrical\r\nbeauty, but with equal force. It closed as follows:--\r\n\r\nWith Laura Hawkins, fair, fascinating and fatal, and with the dissolute\r\nColonel of a lost cause, who has reaped the harvest he sowed, we have\r\nnothing to do. But as the curtain rises on this awful tragedy, we catch\r\na glimpse of the society at the capital under this Administration, which\r\nwe cannot contemplate without alarm for the fate of the Republic. A\r\nthird newspaper took up the subject in a different tone. It said:--\r\n\r\nOur repeated predictions are verified. The pernicious doctrines which\r\nwe have announced as prevailing in American society have been again\r\nillustrated. The name of the city is becoming a reproach. We may have\r\ndone something in averting its ruin in our resolute exposure of the\r\nGreat Frauds; we shall not be deterred from insisting that the outraged\r\nlaws for the protection of human life shall be vindicated now, so that a\r\nperson can walk the streets or enter the public houses, at least in\r\nthe day-time, without the risk of a bullet through his brain. A fourth\r\njournal began its remarks as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe fullness with which we present our readers this morning the details\r\nof the Selby-Hawkins homicide is a miracle of modern journalism.\r\nSubsequent investigation can do little to fill out the picture. It\r\nis the old story. A beautiful woman shoots her absconding lover in\r\ncold-blood; and we shall doubtless learn in due time that if she was not\r\nas mad as a hare in this month of March, she was at least laboring under\r\nwhat is termed \xe2\x80\x9cmomentary insanity.\xe2\x80\x9d It would not be too much to say\r\nthat upon the first publication of the facts of the tragedy, there was\r\nan almost universal feeling of rage against the murderess in the Tombs,\r\nand that reports of her beauty only heightened the indignation. It was\r\nas if she presumed upon that and upon her sex, to defy the law; and\r\nthere was a fervent hope that the law would take its plain course.\r\n\r\nYet Laura was not without friends, and some of them very influential\r\ntoo. She had in her keeping a great many secrets and a great many\r\nreputations, perhaps. Who shall set himself up to judge human motives.\r\nWhy, indeed, might we not feel pity for a woman whose brilliant career\r\nhad been so suddenly extinguished in misfortune and crime? Those who had\r\nknown her so well in Washington might find it impossible to believe\r\nthat the fascinating woman could have had murder in her heart, and\r\nwould readily give ear to the current sentimentality about the temporary\r\naberration of mind under the stress of personal calamity.\r\n\r\nSenator Dilworthy, was greatly shocked, of course, but he was full of\r\ncharity for the erring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall all need mercy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLaura as an inmate of my family was\r\na most exemplary female, amiable, affectionate and truthful, perhaps too\r\nfond of gaiety, and neglectful of the externals of religion, but a woman\r\nof principle. She may have had experiences of which I am ignorant, but\r\nshe could not have gone to this extremity if she had been in her own\r\nright mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo the Senator's credit be it said, he was willing to help Laura and her\r\nfamily in this dreadful trial. She, herself, was not without money, for\r\nthe Washington lobbyist is not seldom more fortunate than the Washington\r\nclaimant, and she was able to procure a good many luxuries to mitigate\r\nthe severity of her prison life. It enabled her also to have her own\r\nfamily near her, and to see some of them daily. The tender solicitude\r\nof her mother, her childlike grief, and her firm belief in the real\r\nguiltlessness of her daughter, touched even the custodians of the Tombs\r\nwho are enured to scenes of pathos.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hawkins had hastened to her daughter as soon as she received money\r\nfor the journey. She had no reproaches, she had only tenderness and\r\npity. She could not shut out the dreadful facts of the case, but it\r\nhad been enough for her that Laura had said, in their first interview,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmother, I did not know what I was doing.\xe2\x80\x9d She obtained lodgings near\r\nthe prison and devoted her life to her daughter, as if she had been\r\nreally her own child. She would have remained in the prison day and\r\nnight if it had been permitted. She was aged and feeble, but this great\r\nnecessity seemed to give her new life.\r\n\r\nThe pathetic story of the old lady's ministrations, and her simplicity\r\nand faith, also got into the newspapers in time, and probably added to\r\nthe pathos of this wrecked woman's fate, which was beginning to be felt\r\nby the public. It was certain that she had champions who thought that\r\nher wrongs ought to be placed against her crime, and expressions of this\r\nfeeling came to her in various ways. Visitors came to see her, and gifts\r\nof fruit and flowers were sent, which brought some cheer into her hard\r\nand gloomy cell.\r\n\r\nLaura had declined to see either Philip or Harry, somewhat to the\r\nformer's relief, who had a notion that she would necessarily feel\r\nhumiliated by seeing him after breaking faith with him, but to the\r\ndiscomfiture of Harry, who still felt her fascination, and thought her\r\nrefusal heartless. He told Philip that of course he had got through with\r\nsuch a woman, but he wanted to see her.\r\n\r\nPhilip, to keep him from some new foolishness, persuaded him to go\r\nwith him to Philadelphia; and, give his valuable services in the mining\r\noperations at Ilium.\r\n\r\nThe law took its course with Laura. She was indicted for murder in\r\nthe first degree and held for trial at the summer term. The two most\r\ndistinguished criminal lawyers in the city had been retained for her\r\ndefence, and to that the resolute woman devoted her days with a courage\r\nthat rose as she consulted with her counsel and understood the methods\r\nof criminal procedure in New York.\r\n\r\nShe was greatly depressed, however, by the news from Washington.\r\nCongress adjourned and her bill had failed to pass the Senate. It must\r\nwait for the next session.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nIt had been a bad winter, somehow, for the firm of Pennybacker, Bigler\r\nand Small. These celebrated contractors usually made more money during\r\nthe session of the legislature at Harrisburg than upon all their summer\r\nwork, and this winter had been unfruitful. It was unaccountable to\r\nBigler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Mr. Bolton,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and Philip was present at the\r\nconversation, \xe2\x80\x9cit puts us all out. It looks as if politics was played\r\nout. We'd counted on the year of Simon's re-election. And, now, he's\r\nreelected, and I've yet to see the first man who's the better for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don't mean to say,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he went in without paying\r\nanything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a cent, not a dash cent, as I can hear,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Bigler,\r\nindignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cI call it a swindle on the state. How it was done gets me.\r\nI never saw such a tight time for money in Harrisburg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere there no combinations, no railroad jobs, no mining schemes put\r\nthrough in connection with the election?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that I knew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bigler, shaking his head in disgust. \xe2\x80\x9cIn fact it\r\nwas openly said, that there was no money in the election. It's perfectly\r\nunheard of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Philip, \xe2\x80\x9cit was effected on what the insurance\r\ncompanies call the 'endowment,' or the 'paid up' plan, by which a policy\r\nis secured after a certain time without further payment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Bolton smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a liberal and sagacious\r\npolitician might own a legislature after a time, and not be bothered\r\nwith keeping up his payments?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever it is,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Mr. Bigler, \xe2\x80\x9cit's devilish ingenious and\r\ngoes ahead of my calculations; it's cleaned me out, when I thought we\r\nhad a dead sure thing. I tell you what it is, gentlemen, I shall go in\r\nfor reform. Things have got pretty mixed when a legislature will give\r\naway a United States senatorship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was melancholy, but Mr. Bigler was not a man to be crushed by one\r\nmisfortune, or to lose his confidence in human nature, on one exhibition\r\nof apparent honesty. He was already on his feet again, or would be if\r\nMr. Bolton could tide him over shoal water for ninety days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe've got something with money in it,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained to Mr. Bolton,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgot hold of it by good luck. We've got the entire contract for Dobson's\r\nPatent Pavement for the city of Mobile. See here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bigler made some figures; contract so much, cost of work and\r\nmaterials so much, profits so much. At the end of three months the\r\ncity would owe the company three hundred and seventy-five thousand\r\ndollars-two hundred thousand of that would be profits. The whole job was\r\nworth at least a million to the company--it might be more. There could\r\nbe no mistake in these figures; here was the contract, Mr. Bolton knew\r\nwhat materials were worth and what the labor would cost.\r\n\r\nMr. Bolton knew perfectly well from sore experience that there was\r\nalways a mistake in figures when Bigler or Small made them, and he knew\r\nthat he ought to send the fellow about his business. Instead of that, he\r\nlet him talk.\r\n\r\nThey only wanted to raise fifty thousand dollars to carry on the\r\ncontract--that expended they would have city bonds. Mr. Bolton said he\r\nhadn't the money. But Bigler could raise it on his name. Mr. Bolton said\r\nhe had no right to put his family to that risk. But the entire contract\r\ncould be assigned to him--the security was ample--it was a fortune to\r\nhim if it was forfeited. Besides Mr. Bigler had been unfortunate, he\r\ndidn't know where to look for the necessaries of life for his family. If\r\nhe could only have one more chance, he was sure he could right himself.\r\nHe begged for it.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Bolton yielded. He could never refuse such appeals. If he had\r\nbefriended a man once and been cheated by him, that man appeared to have\r\na claim upon him forever. He shrank, however, from telling his wife what\r\nhe had done on this occasion, for he knew that if any person was more\r\nodious than Small to his family it was Bigler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip tells me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bolton said that evening, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the man Bigler\r\nhas been with thee again to-day. I hope thee will have nothing more to\r\ndo with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been very unfortunate,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Bolton, uneasily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is always unfortunate, and he is always getting thee into trouble.\r\nBut thee didn't listen to him again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, mother, his family is in want, and I lent him my name--but I\r\ntook ample security. The worst that can happen will be a little\r\ninconvenience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bolton looked grave and anxious, but she did not complain or\r\nremonstrate; she knew what a \xe2\x80\x9clittle inconvenience\xe2\x80\x9d meant, but she knew\r\nthere was no help for it. If Mr. Bolton had been on his way to market to\r\nbuy a dinner for his family with the only dollar he had in the world in\r\nhis pocket, he would have given it to a chance beggar who asked him for\r\nit. Mrs. Bolton only asked (and the question showed that she was no mere\r\nprovident than her husband where her heart was interested),\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut has thee provided money for Philip to use in opening the coal\r\nmine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have set apart as much as it ought to cost to open the mine,\r\nas much as we can afford to lose if no coal is found. Philip has the\r\ncontrol of it, as equal partner in the venture, deducting the capital\r\ninvested. He has great confidence in his success, and I hope for his\r\nsake he won't be disappointed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip could not but feel that he was treated very much like one of the\r\nBolton-family--by all except Ruth. His mother, when he went home after\r\nhis recovery from his accident, had affected to be very jealous of\r\nMrs. Bolton, about whom and Ruth she asked a thousand questions--an\r\naffectation of jealousy which no doubt concealed a real heartache, which\r\ncomes to every mother when her son goes out into the world and forms\r\nnew ties. And to Mrs. Sterling, a widow, living on a small income in a\r\nremote Massachusetts village, Philadelphia was a city of many splendors.\r\nAll its inhabitants seemed highly favored, dwelling in ease and\r\nsurrounded by superior advantages. Some of her neighbors had relations\r\nliving in Philadelphia, and it seemed to them somehow a guarantee of\r\nrespectability to have relations in Philadelphia. Mrs. Sterling was not\r\nsorry to have Philip make his way among such well-to-do people, and she\r\nwas sure that no good fortune could be too good for his deserts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ruth, when Philip came from New York, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have been\r\nassisting in a pretty tragedy. I saw your name in the papers. Is this\r\nwoman a specimen of your western friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy only assistance,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Philip, a little annoyed, \xe2\x80\x9cwas in trying\r\nto keep Harry out of a bad scrape, and I failed after all. He walked\r\ninto her trap, and he has been punished for it. I'm going to take him\r\nup to Ilium to see if he won't work steadily at one thing, and quit his\r\nnonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she as beautiful as the newspapers say she is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know, she has a kind of beauty--she is not like--'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot like Alice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, she is brilliant; she was called the handsomest woman in\r\nWashington--dashing, you know, and sarcastic and witty. Ruth, do you\r\nbelieve a woman ever becomes a devil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMen do, and I don't know why women shouldn't. But I never saw one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Laura Hawkins comes very near it. But it is dreadful to think of\r\nher fate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, do you suppose they will hang a woman? Do you suppose they will be\r\nso barbarous as that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn't thinking of that--it's doubtful if a New York jury would find\r\na woman guilty of any such crime. But to think of her life if she is\r\nacquitted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is dreadful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ruth, thoughtfully, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the worst of it is that\r\nyou men do not want women educated to do anything, to be able to earn an\r\nhonest living by their own exertions. They are educated as if they were\r\nalways to be petted and supported, and there was never to be any such\r\nthing as misfortune. I suppose, now, that you would all choose to have\r\nme stay idly at home, and give up my profession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9cI respect your resolution. But, Ruth,\r\ndo you think you would be happier or do more good in following your\r\nprofession than in having a home of your own?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to hinder having a home of my own?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, perhaps, only you never would be in it--you would be away day\r\nand night, if you had any practice; and what sort of a home would that\r\nmake for your husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of a home is it for the wife whose husband is always away\r\nriding about in his doctor's gig?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you know that is not fair. The woman makes the home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip and Ruth often had this sort of discussion, to which Philip was\r\nalways trying to give a personal turn. He was now about to go to Ilium\r\nfor the season, and he did not like to go without some assurance from\r\nRuth that she might perhaps love him some day; when he was worthy of it,\r\nand when he could offer her something better than a partnership in his\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should work with a great deal better heart, Ruth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said the\r\nmorning he was taking leave, \xe2\x80\x9cif I knew you cared for me a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth was looking down; the color came faintly to her cheeks, and she\r\nhesitated. She needn't be looking down, he thought, for she was ever so\r\nmuch shorter than tall Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's not much of a place, Ilium,\xe2\x80\x9d Philip went on, as if a little\r\ngeographical remark would fit in here as well as anything else, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nshall have plenty of time to think over the responsibility I have taken,\r\nand--\xe2\x80\x9d his observation did not seem to be coming out any where.\r\n\r\nBut Ruth looked up, and there was a light in her eyes that quickened\r\nPhil's pulse. She took his hand, and said with serious sweetness:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee mustn't lose heart, Philip.\xe2\x80\x9d And then she added, in another mood,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee knows I graduate in the summer and shall have my diploma. And\r\nif any thing happens--mines explode sometimes--thee can send for me.\r\nFarewell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Ilium coal mine was begun with energy, but without\r\nmany omens of success. Philip was running a tunnel into the breast of\r\nthe mountain, in faith that the coal stratum ran there as it ought\r\nto. How far he must go in he believed he knew, but no one could tell\r\nexactly. Some of the miners said that they should probably go through\r\nthe mountain, and that the hole could be used for a railway tunnel. The\r\nmining camp was a busy place at any rate. Quite a settlement of board\r\nand log shanties had gone up, with a blacksmith shop, a small machine\r\nshop, and a temporary store for supplying the wants of the workmen.\r\nPhilip and Harry pitched a commodious tent, and lived in the full\r\nenjoyment of the free life.\r\n\r\nThere is no difficulty in digging a bole in the ground, if you have\r\nmoney enough to pay for the digging, but those who try this sort of work\r\nare always surprised at the large amount of money necessary to make a\r\nsmall hole. The earth is never willing to yield one product, hidden in\r\nher bosom, without an equivalent for it. And when a person asks of her\r\ncoal, she is quite apt to require gold in exchange.\r\n\r\nIt was exciting work for all concerned in it. As the tunnel advanced\r\ninto the rock every day promised to be the golden day. This very blast\r\nmight disclose the treasure.\r\n\r\nThe work went on week after week, and at length during the night as\r\nwell as the daytime. Gangs relieved each other, and the tunnel was every\r\nhour, inch by inch and foot by foot, crawling into the mountain. Philip\r\nwas on the stretch of hope and excitement. Every pay day he saw his\r\nfunds melting away, and still there was only the faintest show of what\r\nthe miners call \xe2\x80\x9csigns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe life suited Harry, whose buoyant hopefulness was never disturbed.\r\nHe made endless calculations, which nobody could understand, of the\r\nprobable position of the vein. He stood about among the workmen with the\r\nbusiest air. When he was down at Ilium he called himself the engineer\r\nof the works, and he used to spend hours smoking his pipe with the Dutch\r\nlandlord on the hotel porch, and astonishing the idlers there with\r\nthe stories of his railroad operations in Missouri. He talked with the\r\nlandlord, too, about enlarging his hotel, and about buying some village\r\nlots, in the prospect of a rise, when the mine was opened. He taught the\r\nDutchman how to mix a great many cooling drinks for the summer time,\r\nand had a bill at the hotel, the growing length of which Mr. Dusenheimer\r\ncontemplated with pleasant anticipations. Mr. Brierly was a very useful\r\nand cheering person wherever he went.\r\n\r\nMidsummer arrived: Philip could report to Mr. Bolton only progress, and\r\nthis was not a cheerful message for him to send to Philadelphia in\r\nreply to inquiries that he thought became more and more anxious. Philip\r\nhimself was a prey to the constant fear that the money would give out\r\nbefore the coal was struck.\r\n\r\nAt this time Harry was summoned to New York, to attend the trial of\r\nLaura Hawkins. It was possible that Philip would have to go also, her\r\nlawyer wrote, but they hoped for a postponement. There was important\r\nevidence that they could not yet obtain, and he hoped the judge would\r\nnot force them to a trial unprepared. There were many reasons for a\r\ndelay, reasons which of course are never mentioned, but which it would\r\nseem that a New York judge sometimes must understand, when he grants\r\na postponement upon a motion that seems to the public altogether\r\ninadequate.\r\n\r\nHarry went, but he soon came back. The trial was put off. Every week we\r\ncan gain, said the learned counsel, Braham, improves our chances. The\r\npopular rage never lasts long.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe've struck it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the announcement at the tent door that woke Philip out of a\r\nsound sleep at dead of night, and shook all the sleepiness out of him in\r\na trice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Where is it? When? Coal? Let me see it. What quality is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n were some of the rapid questions that Philip poured out as he hurriedly\r\ndressed. \xe2\x80\x9cHarry, wake up, my boy, the coal train is coming. Struck it,\r\neh? Let's see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe foreman put down his lantern, and handed Philip a black lump. There\r\nwas no mistake about it, it was the hard, shining anthracite, and its\r\nfreshly fractured surface, glistened in the light like polished steel.\r\nDiamond never shone with such lustre in the eyes of Philip.\r\n\r\nHarry was exuberant, but Philip's natural caution found expression in\r\nhis next remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Roberts, you are sure about this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat--sure that it's coal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, no, sure that it's the main vein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes. We took it to be that\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you from the first?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't say we did at first. No, we didn't. Most of the indications\r\nwere there, but not all of them, not all of them. So we thought we'd\r\nprospect a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was tolerable thick, and looked as if it might be the vein--looked\r\nas if it ought to be the vein. Then we went down on it a little. Looked\r\nbetter all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you strike it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout ten o'clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you've been prospecting about four hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, been sinking on it something over four hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm afraid you couldn't go down very far in four hours--could you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes--it's a good deal broke up, nothing but picking and gadding\r\nstuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it does look encouraging, sure enough--but then the lacking\r\nindications--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'd rather we had them, Mr. Sterling, but I've seen more than one good\r\npermanent mine struck without 'em in my time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that is encouraging too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there was the Union, the Alabama and the Black Mohawk--all good,\r\nsound mines, you know--all just exactly like this one when we first\r\nstruck them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I begin to feel a good deal more easy. I guess we've really got\r\nit. I remember hearing them tell about the Black Mohawk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm free to say that I believe it, and the men all think so too. They\r\nare all old hands at this business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome Harry, let's go up and look at it, just for the comfort of it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Philip. They came back in the course of an hour, satisfied and\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nThere was no more sleep for them that night. They lit their pipes, put\r\na specimen of the coal on the table, and made it a kind of loadstone of\r\nthought and conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry, \xe2\x80\x9cthere will have to be a branch track built,\r\nand a 'switch-back' up the hill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there will be no trouble about getting the money for that now. We\r\ncould sell-out tomorrow for a handsome sum. That sort of coal doesn't\r\ngo begging within a mile of a rail-road. I wonder if Mr. Bolton would\r\nrather sell out or work it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, work it,\xe2\x80\x9d says Harry, \xe2\x80\x9cprobably the whole mountain is coal now\r\nyou've got to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly it might not be much of a vein after all,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly it is; I'll bet it's forty feet thick. I told you. I knew the\r\nsort of thing as soon as I put my eyes on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip's next thought was to write to his friends and announce their\r\ngood fortune. To Mr. Bolton he wrote a short, business letter, as calm\r\nas he could make it. They had found coal of excellent quality, but\r\nthey could not yet tell with absolute certainty what the vein was. The\r\nprospecting was still going on. Philip also wrote to Ruth; but though\r\nthis letter may have glowed, it was not with the heat of burning\r\nanthracite. He needed no artificial heat to warm his pen and kindle his\r\nardor when he sat down to write to Ruth. But it must be confessed that\r\nthe words never flowed so easily before, and he ran on for an hour\r\ndisporting in all the extravagance of his imagination. When Ruth read\r\nit, she doubted if the fellow had not gone out of his senses. And it was\r\nnot until she reached the postscript that she discovered the cause of\r\nthe exhilaration. \xe2\x80\x9cP. S.--We have found coal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe news couldn't have come to Mr. Bolton in better time. He had never\r\nbeen so sorely pressed. A dozen schemes which he had in hand, any one\r\nof which might turn up a fortune, all languished, and each needed just\r\na little more money to save that which had been invested. He hadn't a\r\npiece of real estate that was not covered with mortgages, even to\r\nthe wild tract which Philip was experimenting on, and which had, no\r\nmarketable value above the incumbrance on it.\r\n\r\nHe had come home that day early, unusually dejected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we shall have to give up our\r\nhouse. I don't care for myself, but for thee and the children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be the least of misfortunes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bolton, cheerfully,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif thee can clear thyself from debt and anxiety, which is wearing thee\r\nout, we can live any where. Thee knows we were never happier than when\r\nwe were in a much humbler home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is, Margaret, that affair of Bigler and Small's has come\r\non me just when I couldn't stand another ounce. They have made another\r\nfailure of it. I might have known they would; and the sharpers, or\r\nfools, I don't know which, have contrived to involve me for three times\r\nas much as the first obligation. The security is in my hands, but it\r\nis good for nothing to me. I have not the money to do anything with the\r\ncontract.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth heard this dismal news without great surprise. She had long felt\r\nthat they were living on a volcano, that might go in to active operation\r\nat any hour. Inheriting from her father an active brain and the courage\r\nto undertake new things, she had little of his sanguine temperament\r\nwhich blinds one to difficulties and possible failures. She had little\r\nconfidence in the many schemes which had been about to lift her father\r\nout of all his embarrassments and into great wealth, ever since she\r\nwas a child; as she grew older, she rather wondered that they were as\r\nprosperous as they seemed to be, and that they did not all go to smash\r\namid so many brilliant projects. She was nothing but a woman, and did\r\nnot know how much of the business prosperity of the world is only a\r\nbubble of credit and speculation, one scheme helping to float another\r\nwhich is no better than it, and the whole liable to come to naught and\r\nconfusion as soon as the busy brain that conceived them ceases its power\r\nto devise, or when some accident produces a sudden panic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, I shall be the stay of the family, yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ruth, with an\r\napproach to gaiety; \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we move into a little house in town, will\r\nthee let me put a little sign on the door: DR. RUTH BOLTON? Mrs. Dr.\r\nLongstreet, thee knows, has a great income.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho will pay for the sign, Ruth?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Bolton.\r\n\r\nA servant entered with the afternoon mail from the office. Mr. Bolton\r\ntook his letters listlessly, dreading to open them. He knew well what\r\nthey contained, new difficulties, more urgent demands for money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, here is one from Philip. Poor fellow. I shall feel his\r\ndisappointment as much as my own bad luck. It is hard to bear when one\r\nis young.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe opened the letter and read. As he read his face lightened, and he\r\nfetched such a sigh of relief, that Mrs. Bolton and Ruth both exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead that,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cPhilip has found coal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe world was changed in a moment. One little sentence had done it.\r\nThere was no more trouble. Philip had found coal. That meant relief.\r\nThat meant fortune. A great weight was taken off, and the spirits of the\r\nwhole household rose magically. Good Money! beautiful demon of Money,\r\nwhat an enchanter thou art! Ruth felt that she was of less consequence\r\nin the household, now that Philip had found Coal, and perhaps she was\r\nnot sorry to feel so.\r\n\r\nMr. Bolton was ten years younger the next morning. He went into the\r\ncity, and showed his letter on change. It was the sort of news his\r\nfriends were quite willing to listen to. They took a new interest in\r\nhim. If it was confirmed, Bolton would come right up again. There would\r\nbe no difficulty about his getting all the money he wanted. The money\r\nmarket did not seem to be half so tight as it was the day before. Mr.\r\nBolton spent a very pleasant day in his office, and went home revolving\r\nsome new plans, and the execution of some projects he had long been\r\nprevented from entering upon by the lack of money.\r\n\r\nThe day had been spent by Philip in no less excitement. By daylight,\r\nwith Philip's letters to the mail, word had gone down to Ilium that coal\r\nhad been found, and very early a crowd of eager spectators had come up\r\nto see for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cprospecting\xe2\x80\x9d continued day and night for upwards of a week, and\r\nduring the first four or five days the indications grew more and more\r\npromising, and the telegrams and letters kept Mr. Bolton duly posted.\r\nBut at last a change came, and the promises began to fail with alarming\r\nrapidity. In the end it was demonstrated without the possibility of a\r\ndoubt that the great \xe2\x80\x9cfind\xe2\x80\x9d was nothing but a worthless seam.\r\n\r\nPhilip was cast down, all the more so because he had been so foolish\r\nas to send the news to Philadelphia before he knew what he was writing\r\nabout. And now he must contradict it. \xe2\x80\x9cIt turns out to be only a mere\r\nseam,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we look upon it as an indication of better further\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlas! Mr. Bolton's affairs could not wait for \xe2\x80\x9cindications.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nfuture might have a great deal in store, but the present was black and\r\nhopeless. It was doubtful if any sacrifice could save him from ruin.\r\nYet sacrifice he must make, and that instantly, in the hope of saving\r\nsomething from the wreck of his fortune.\r\n\r\nHis lovely country home must go. That would bring the most ready money.\r\nThe house that he had built with loving thought for each one of his\r\nfamily, as he planned its luxurious apartments and adorned it; the\r\ngrounds that he had laid out, with so much delight in following the\r\ntastes of his wife, with whom the country, the cultivation of rare\r\ntrees and flowers, the care of garden and lawn and conservatories were\r\na passion almost; this home, which he had hoped his children would enjoy\r\nlong after he had done with it, must go.\r\n\r\nThe family bore the sacrifice better than he did. They declared in\r\nfact--women are such hypocrites--that they quite enjoyed the city\r\n(it was in August) after living so long in the country, that it was a\r\nthousand times more convenient in every respect; Mrs. Bolton said it was\r\na relief from the worry of a large establishment, and Ruth reminded her\r\nfather that she should have had to come to town anyway before long.\r\n\r\nMr. Bolton was relieved, exactly as a water-logged ship is lightened by\r\nthrowing overboard the most valuable portion of the cargo--but the leak\r\nwas not stopped. Indeed his credit was injured instead of helped by the\r\nprudent step he had taken. It was regarded as a sure evidence of his\r\nembarrassment, and it was much more difficult for him to obtain\r\nhelp than if he had, instead of retrenching, launched into some new\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nPhilip was greatly troubled, and exaggerated his own share in the\r\nbringing about of the calamity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not look at it so!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bolton wrote him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have neither\r\nhelped nor hindered--but you know you may help by and by. It would have\r\nall happened just so, if we had never begun to dig that hole. That is\r\nonly a drop. Work away. I still have hope that something will occur to\r\nrelieve me. At any rate we must not give up the mine, so long as we have\r\nany show.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlas! the relief did not come. New misfortunes came instead. When the\r\nextent of the Bigler swindle was disclosed there was no more hope that\r\nMr. Bolton could extricate himself, and he had, as an honest man, no\r\nresource except to surrender all his property for the benefit of his\r\ncreditors.\r\n\r\nThe Autumn came and found Philip working with diminished force but still\r\nwith hope. He had again and again been encouraged by good \xe2\x80\x9cindications,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n but he had again and again been disappointed. He could not go on much\r\nlonger, and almost everybody except himself had thought it was useless\r\nto go on as long as he had been doing.\r\n\r\nWhen the news came of Mr. Bolton's failure, of course the work stopped.\r\nThe men were discharged, the tools were housed, the hopeful noise of\r\npickman and driver ceased, and the mining camp had that desolate and\r\nmournful aspect which always hovers over a frustrated enterprise.\r\n\r\nPhilip sat down amid the ruins, and almost wished he were buried in\r\nthem. How distant Ruth was now from him, now, when she might need him\r\nmost. How changed was all the Philadelphia world, which had hitherto\r\nstood for the exemplification of happiness and prosperity.\r\n\r\nHe still had faith that there was coal in that mountain. He made a\r\npicture of himself living there a hermit in a shanty by the tunnel,\r\ndigging away with solitary pick and wheelbarrow, day after day and\r\nyear after year, until he grew gray and aged, and was known in all that\r\nregion as the old man of the mountain. Perhaps some day--he felt it must\r\nbe so some day--he should strike coal. But what if he did? Who would\r\nbe alive to care for it then? What would he care for it then? No, a man\r\nwants riches in his youth, when the world is fresh to him. He wondered\r\nwhy Providence could not have reversed the usual process, and let the\r\nmajority of men begin with wealth and gradually spend it, and die poor\r\nwhen they no longer needed it.\r\n\r\nHarry went back to the city. It was evident that his services were no\r\nlonger needed. Indeed, he had letters from his uncle, which he did not\r\nread to Philip, desiring him to go to San Francisco to look after some\r\ngovernment contracts in the harbor there.\r\n\r\nPhilip had to look about him for something to do; he was like Adam;\r\nthe world was all before him whereto choose. He made, before he went\r\nelsewhere, a somewhat painful visit to Philadelphia, painful but yet\r\nnot without its sweetnesses. The family had never shown him so much\r\naffection before; they all seemed to think his disappointment of more\r\nimportance than their own misfortune. And there was that in Ruth's\r\nmanner--in what she gave him and what she withheld--that would have made\r\na hero of a very much less promising character than Philip Sterling.\r\n\r\nAmong the assets of the Bolton property, the Ilium tract was sold, and\r\nPhilip bought it in at the vendue, for a song, for no one cared to even\r\nundertake the mortgage on it except himself. He went away the owner of\r\nit, and had ample time before he reached home in November, to calculate\r\nhow much poorer he was by possessing it.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for the historian, with even the best intentions, to\r\ncontrol events or compel the persons of his narrative to act wisely or\r\nto be successful. It is easy to see how things might have been better\r\nmanaged; a very little change here and there would have made a very\r\ndifferent history of this one now in hand.\r\n\r\nIf Philip had adopted some regular profession, even some trade, he might\r\nnow be a prosperous editor or a conscientious plumber, or an honest\r\nlawyer, and have borrowed money at the saving's bank and built a\r\ncottage, and be now furnishing it for the occupancy of Ruth and himself.\r\nInstead of this, with only a smattering of civil engineering, he is\r\nat his mother's house, fretting and fuming over his ill-luck, and the\r\nhardness and, dishonesty of men, and thinking of nothing but how to get\r\nthe coal out of the Ilium hills.\r\n\r\nIf Senator Dilworthy had not made that visit to Hawkeye, the Hawkins\r\nfamily and Col. Sellers would not now be dancing attendance upon\r\nCongress, and endeavoring to tempt that immaculate body into one of\r\nthose appropriations, for the benefit of its members, which the members\r\nfind it so difficult to explain to their constituents; and Laura would\r\nnot be lying in the Tombs, awaiting her trial for murder, and doing\r\nher best, by the help of able counsel, to corrupt the pure fountain of\r\ncriminal procedure in New York.\r\n\r\nIf Henry Brierly had been blown up on the first Mississippi steamboat he\r\nset foot on, as the chances were that he would be, he and Col. Sellers\r\nnever would have gone into the Columbus Navigation scheme, and probably\r\nnever into the East Tennessee Land scheme, and he would not now be\r\ndetained in New York from very important business operations on the\r\nPacific coast, for the sole purpose of giving evidence to convict of\r\nmurder the only woman he ever loved half as much as he loves himself. If\r\nMr. Bolton had said the little word \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d to Mr. Bigler, Alice Montague\r\nmight now be spending the winter in Philadelphia, and Philip also\r\n(waiting to resume his mining operations in the spring); and Ruth would\r\nnot be an assistant in a Philadelphia hospital, taxing her strength with\r\narduous routine duties, day by day, in order to lighten a little the\r\nburdens that weigh upon her unfortunate family.\r\n\r\nIt is altogether a bad business. An honest historian, who had progressed\r\nthus far, and traced everything to such a condition of disaster\r\nand suspension, might well be justified in ending his narrative and\r\nwriting--\xe2\x80\x9cafter this the deluge.\xe2\x80\x9d His only consolation would be in the\r\nreflection that he was not responsible for either characters or events.\r\n\r\nAnd the most annoying thought is that a little money, judiciously\r\napplied, would relieve the burdens and anxieties of most of these\r\npeople; but affairs seem to be so arranged that money is most difficult\r\nto get when people need it most.\r\n\r\nA little of what Mr. Bolton has weakly given to unworthy people would\r\nnow establish his family in a sort of comfort, and relieve Ruth of the\r\nexcessive toil for which she inherited no adequate physical vigor. A\r\nlittle money would make a prince of Col. Sellers; and a little more\r\nwould calm the anxiety of Washington Hawkins about Laura, for however\r\nthe trial ended, he could feel sure of extricating her in the end.\r\nAnd if Philip had a little money he could unlock the stone door in\r\nthe mountain whence would issue a stream of shining riches. It needs a\r\ngolden wand to strike that rock. If the Knobs University bill could only\r\ngo through, what a change would be wrought in the condition of most of\r\nthe persons in this history. Even Philip himself would feel the good\r\neffects of it; for Harry would have something and Col. Sellers would\r\nhave something; and have not both these cautious people expressed a\r\ndetermination to take an interest in the Ilium mine when they catch\r\ntheir larks?\r\n\r\nPhilip could not resist the inclination to pay a visit to Fallkill. He\r\nhad not been at the Montague's since the time he saw Ruth there, and he\r\nwanted to consult the Squire about an occupation. He was determined now\r\nto waste no more time in waiting on Providence, but to go to work at\r\nsomething, if it were nothing better, than teaching in the Fallkill\r\nSeminary, or digging clams on Hingham beach. Perhaps he could read law\r\nin Squire Montague's office while earning his bread as a teacher in the\r\nSeminary.\r\n\r\nIt was not altogether Philip's fault, let us own, that he was in this\r\nposition. There are many young men like him in American society, of\r\nhis age, opportunities, education and abilities, who have really been\r\neducated for nothing and have let themselves drift, in the hope that\r\nthey will find somehow, and by some sudden turn of good luck, the\r\ngolden road to fortune. He was not idle or lazy, he had energy and a\r\ndisposition to carve his own way. But he was born into a time when all\r\nyoung men of his age caught the fever of speculation, and expected to\r\nget on in the world by the omission of some of the regular processes\r\nwhich have been appointed from of old.\r\n\r\nAnd examples were not wanting to encourage him. He saw people, all\r\naround him, poor yesterday, rich to-day, who had come into sudden\r\nopulence by some means which they could not have classified among any of\r\nthe regular occupations of life. A war would give such a fellow a\r\ncareer and very likely fame. He might have been a \xe2\x80\x9crailroad man,\xe2\x80\x9d or a\r\npolitician, or a land speculator, or one of those mysterious people\r\nwho travel free on all rail-roads and steamboats, and are continually\r\ncrossing and recrossing the Atlantic, driven day and night about nobody\r\nknows what, and make a great deal of money by so doing. Probably, at\r\nlast, he sometimes thought with a whimsical smile, he should end by\r\nbeing an insurance agent, and asking people to insure their lives for\r\nhis benefit.\r\n\r\nPossibly Philip did not think how much the attractions of Fallkill were\r\nincreased by the presence of Alice there. He had known her so long,\r\nshe had somehow grown into his life by habit, that he would expect the\r\npleasure of her society without thinking much about it. Latterly he\r\nnever thought of her without thinking of Ruth, and if he gave the\r\nsubject any attention, it was probably in an undefined consciousness\r\nthat, he had her sympathy in his love, and that she was always willing\r\nto hear him talk about it. If he ever wondered that Alice herself was\r\nnot in love and never spoke of the possibility of her own marriage, it\r\nwas a transient thought for love did not seem necessary, exactly, to one\r\nso calm and evenly balanced and with so many resources in her herself.\r\n\r\nWhatever her thoughts may have been they were unknown to Philip, as they\r\nare to these historians; if she was seeming to be what she was not, and\r\ncarrying a burden heavier than any one else carried, because she had\r\nto bear it alone, she was only doing what thousands of women do, with a\r\nself-renunciation and heroism, of which men, impatient and complaining,\r\nhave no conception. Have not these big babies with beards filled all\r\nliterature with their outcries, their griefs and their lamentations?\r\nIt is always the gentle sex which is hard and cruel and fickle and\r\nimplacable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think you would be contented to live in Fallkill, and attend the\r\ncounty Court?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Alice, when Philip had opened the budget of his new\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not always,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, \xe2\x80\x9cI might go and practice in Boston\r\nmaybe, or go to Chicago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr you might get elected to Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip looked at Alice to see if she was in earnest and not chaffing\r\nhim. Her face was quite sober. Alice was one of those patriotic women\r\nin the rural districts, who think men are still selected for Congress on\r\naccount of qualifications for the office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, \xe2\x80\x9cthe chances are that a man cannot get into congress\r\nnow without resorting to arts and means that should render him unfit to\r\ngo there; of course there are exceptions; but do you know that I\r\ncould not go into politics if I were a lawyer, without losing standing\r\nsomewhat in my profession, and without raising at least a suspicion of\r\nmy intentions and unselfishness? Why, it is telegraphed all over the\r\ncountry and commented on as something wonderful if a congressman votes\r\nhonestly and unselfishly and refuses to take advantage of his position\r\nto steal from the government.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Alice, \xe2\x80\x9cI should think it a noble ambition to go to\r\ncongress, if it is so bad, and help reform it. I don't believe it is as\r\ncorrupt as the English parliament used to be, if there is any truth in\r\nthe novels, and I suppose that is reformed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm sure I don't know where the reform is to begin. I've seen a\r\nperfectly capable, honest man, time and again, run against an illiterate\r\ntrickster, and get beaten. I suppose if the people wanted decent members\r\nof congress they would elect them. Perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Philip with a\r\nsmile, \xe2\x80\x9cthe women will have to vote.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I should be willing to, if it were a necessity, just as I\r\nwould go to war and do what I could, if the country couldn't be saved\r\notherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice, with a spirit that surprised Philip, well as he\r\nthought he knew her. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I were a young gentleman in these times--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip laughed outright. \xe2\x80\x9cIt's just what Ruth used to say, 'if she were\r\na man.' I wonder if all the young ladies are contemplating a change of\r\nsex.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, only a changed sex,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Alice; \xe2\x80\x9cwe contemplate for the most\r\npart young men who don't care for anything they ought to care for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, looking humble, \xe2\x80\x9cI care for some things, you and\r\nRuth for instance; perhaps I ought not to. Perhaps I ought to care for\r\nCongress and that sort of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't be a goose, Philip. I heard from Ruth yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I see her letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed. But I am afraid her hard work is telling on her, together\r\nwith her anxiety about her father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think, Alice,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip with one of those selfish thoughts\r\nthat are not seldom mixed with real love, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Ruth prefers her\r\nprofession to--to marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Alice, rising to quit the room, and speaking\r\nhurriedly as if the words were forced from her, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are as blind as a\r\nbat; Ruth would cut off her right hand for you this minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip never noticed that Alice's face was flushed and that her voice\r\nwas unsteady; he only thought of the delicious words he had heard. And\r\nthe poor girl, loyal to Ruth, loyal to Philip, went straight to her\r\nroom, locked the door, threw herself on the bed and sobbed as if her\r\nheart would break. And then she prayed that her Father in Heaven would\r\ngive her strength. And after a time she was calm again, and went to\r\nher bureau drawer and took from a hiding place a little piece of paper,\r\nyellow with age. Upon it was pinned a four-leaved clover, dry and yellow\r\nalso. She looked long at this foolish memento. Under the clover leaf was\r\nwritten in a school-girl's hand--\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip, June, 186-.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSquire Montague thought very well of Philip's proposal. It would have\r\nbeen better if he had begun the study of the law as soon as he left\r\ncollege, but it was not too late now, and besides he had gathered some\r\nknowledge of the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Squire, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you mean to abandon your land in\r\nPennsylvania?\xe2\x80\x9d This track of land seemed an immense possible fortune to\r\nthis New England lawyer-farmer. \xe2\x80\x9cHasn't it good timber, and doesn't the\r\nrailroad almost touch it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't do anything with it now. Perhaps I can sometime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your reason for supposing that there is coal there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe opinion of the best geologist I could consult, my own observation\r\nof the country, and the little veins of it we found. I feel certain it\r\nis there. I shall find it some day. I know it. If I can only keep the\r\nland till I make money enough to try again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip took from his pocket a map of the anthracite coal region, and\r\npointed out the position of the Ilium mountain which he had begun to\r\ntunnel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn't it look like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt certainly does,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Squire, very much interested. It is not\r\nunusual for a quiet country gentleman to be more taken with such\r\na venture than a speculator who, has had more experience in its\r\nuncertainty. It was astonishing how many New England clergymen, in the\r\ntime of the petroleum excitement, took chances in oil. The Wall street\r\nbrokers are said to do a good deal of small business for country\r\nclergymen, who are moved no doubt with the laudable desire of purifying\r\nthe New York stock board.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't see that there is much risk,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Squire, at length. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\ntimber is worth more than the mortgage; and if that coal seam does run\r\nthere, it's a magnificent fortune. Would you like to try it again in the\r\nspring, Phil?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLike to try it! If he could have a little help, he would work himself,\r\nwith pick and barrow, and live on a crust. Only give him one more\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nAnd this is how it came about that the cautious old Squire Montague was\r\ndrawn into this young fellow's speculation, and began to have his serene\r\nold age disturbed by anxieties and by the hope of a great stroke of\r\nluck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, I only care about it for the boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The Squire was\r\nlike everybody else; sooner or later he must \xe2\x80\x9ctake a chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is probably on account of the lack of enterprise in women that they\r\nare not so fond of stock speculations and mine ventures as men. It\r\nis only when woman becomes demoralized that she takes to any sort of\r\ngambling. Neither Alice nor Ruth were much elated with the prospect of\r\nPhilip's renewal of his mining enterprise.\r\n\r\nBut Philip was exultant. He wrote to Ruth as if his fortune were already\r\nmade, and as if the clouds that lowered over the house of Bolton were\r\nalready in the deep bosom of a coal mine buried. Towards spring he\r\nwent to Philadelphia with his plans all matured for a new campaign. His\r\nenthusiasm was irresistible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip has come, Philip has come,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the children, as if some great\r\ngood had again come into the household; and the refrain even sang itself\r\nover in Ruth's heart as she went the weary hospital rounds. Mr. Bolton\r\nfelt more courage than he had had in months, at the sight of his manly\r\nface and the sound of his cheery voice.\r\n\r\nRuth's course was vindicated now, and it certainly did not become\r\nPhilip, who had nothing to offer but a future chance against the visible\r\nresult of her determination and industry, to open an argument with\r\nher. Ruth was never more certain that she was right and that she was\r\nsufficient unto herself. She, may be, did not much heed the still small\r\nvoice that sang in her maiden heart as she went about her work, and\r\nwhich lightened it and made it easy, \xe2\x80\x9cPhilip has come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad for father's sake,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Philip, \xe2\x80\x9cthat thee has come.\r\nI can see that he depends greatly upon what thee can do. He thinks\r\nwomen won't hold out long,\xe2\x80\x9d added Ruth with the smile that Philip never\r\nexactly understood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd aren't you tired sometimes of the struggle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTired? Yes, everybody is tired I suppose. But it is a glorious\r\nprofession. And would you want me to be dependent, Philip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes, a little,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, feeling his way towards what he\r\nwanted to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn what, for instance, just now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ruth, a little maliciously\r\nPhilip thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, on--\xe2\x80\x9d he couldn't quite say it, for it occurred to him that he\r\nwas a poor stick for any body to lean on in the present state of his\r\nfortune, and that the woman before him was at least as independent as he\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't mean depend,\xe2\x80\x9d he began again. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I love you, that's all. Am\r\nI nothing--to you?\xe2\x80\x9d And Philip looked a little defiant, and as if he\r\nhad said something that ought to brush away all the sophistries of\r\nobligation on either side, between man and woman.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Ruth saw this. Perhaps she saw that her own theories of a\r\ncertain equality of power, which ought to precede a union of two hearts,\r\nmight be pushed too far. Perhaps she had felt sometimes her own weakness\r\nand the need after all of so dear a sympathy and so tender an interest\r\nconfessed, as that which Philip could give. Whatever moved her--the\r\nriddle is as old as creation--she simply looked up to Philip and said in\r\na low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cEverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Philip clasping both her hands in his, and looking down into her\r\neyes, which drank in all his tenderness with the thirst of a true\r\nwoman's nature--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Philip, come out here,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted young Eli, throwing the door wide\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nAnd Ruth escaped away to her room, her heart singing again, and now as\r\nif it would burst for joy, \xe2\x80\x9cPhilip has come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat night Philip received a dispatch from Harry--\xe2\x80\x9cThe trial begins\r\ntomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nDecember 18--, found Washington Hawkins and Col. Sellers once more at\r\nthe capitol of the nation, standing guard over the University bill.\r\nThe former gentleman was despondent, the latter hopeful. Washington's\r\ndistress of mind was chiefly on Laura's account. The court would soon\r\nsit to try her case, he said, and consequently a great deal of ready\r\nmoney would be needed in the engineering of it. The University bill was\r\nsure to pass this time, and that would make money plenty, but might not\r\nthe help come too late? Congress had only just assembled, and delays\r\nwere to be feared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel, \xe2\x80\x9cI don't know but you are more or less right,\r\nthere. Now let's figure up a little on, the preliminaries. I think\r\nCongress always tries to do as near right as it can, according to its\r\nlights. A man can't ask any fairer than that. The first preliminary it\r\nalways starts out on, is to clean itself, so to speak. It will arraign\r\ntwo or three dozen of its members, or maybe four or five dozen, for\r\ntaking bribes to vote for this and that and the other bill last winter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt goes up into the dozens, does it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes; in a free country likes ours, where any man can run for\r\nCongress and anybody can vote for him, you can't expect immortal purity\r\nall the time--it ain't in nature. Sixty or eighty or a hundred and fifty\r\npeople are bound to get in who are not angels in disguise, as young\r\nHicks the correspondent says; but still it is a very good average; very\r\ngood indeed. As long as it averages as well as that, I think we can feel\r\nvery well satisfied. Even in these days, when people growl so much and\r\nthe newspapers are so out of patience, there is still a very respectable\r\nminority of honest men in Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy a respectable minority of honest men can't do any good, Colonel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes it can, too\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, how?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, in many ways, many ways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what are the ways?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--I don't know--it is a question that requires time; a body\r\ncan't answer every question right off-hand. But it does do good. I am\r\nsatisfied of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, then; grant that it does good; go on with the\r\npreliminaries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I am coming to. First, as I said, they will try a lot of\r\nmembers for taking money for votes. That will take four weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that's like last year; and it is a sheer waste of the time for\r\nwhich the nation pays those men to work--that is what that is. And it\r\npinches when a body's got a bill waiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA waste of time, to purify the fountain of public law? Well, I never\r\nheard anybody express an idea like that before. But if it were, it would\r\nstill be the fault of the minority, for the majority don't\r\ninstitute these proceedings. There is where that minority becomes an\r\nobstruction--but still one can't say it is on the wrong side.--Well,\r\nafter they have finished the bribery cases, they will take up cases of\r\nmembers who have bought their seats with money. That will take another\r\nfour weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good; go on. You have accounted for two-thirds of the session.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext they will try each other for various smaller irregularities, like\r\nthe sale of appointments to West Point cadetships, and that sort of\r\nthing--mere trifling pocket-money enterprises that might better be\r\npassed over in silence, perhaps, but then one of our Congresses\r\ncan never rest easy till it has thoroughly purified itself of all\r\nblemishes--and that is a thing to be applauded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long does it take to disinfect itself of these minor impurities?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, about two weeks, generally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Congress always lies helpless in quarantine ten weeks of a session.\r\nThat's encouraging. Colonel, poor Laura will never get any benefit\r\nfrom our bill. Her trial will be over before Congress has half purified\r\nitself.--And doesn't it occur to you that by the time it has expelled\r\nall its impure members there may not be enough members left to do\r\nbusiness legally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy I did not say Congress would expel anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell won't it expel anybody?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot necessarily. Did it last year? It never does. That would not be\r\nregular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why waste all the session in that tomfoolery of trying members?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is usual; it is customary; the country requires it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the country is a fool, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no. The country thinks somebody is going to be expelled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, when nobody is expelled, what does the country think then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy that time, the thing has strung out so long that the country is sick\r\nand tired of it and glad to have a change on any terms. But all that\r\ninquiry is not lost. It has a good moral effect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho does it have a good moral effect on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--I don't know. On foreign countries, I think. We have always been\r\nunder the gaze of foreign countries. There is no country in the world,\r\nsir, that pursues corruption as inveterately as we do. There is no\r\ncountry in the world whose representatives try each other as much as\r\nours do, or stick to it as long on a stretch. I think there is something\r\ngreat in being a model for the whole civilized world, Washington.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don't mean a model; you mean an example.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it's all the same; it's just the same thing. It shows that a man\r\ncan't be corrupt in this country without sweating for it, I can tell you\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHang it, Colonel, you just said we never punish anybody for villainous\r\npractices.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut good God we try them, don't we! Is it nothing to show a disposition\r\nto sift things and bring people to a strict account? I tell you it has\r\nits effect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, bother the effect!--What is it they do do? How do they proceed?\r\nYou know perfectly well--and it is all bosh, too. Come, now, how do they\r\nproceed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy they proceed right and regular--and it ain't bosh, Washington, it\r\nain't bosh. They appoint a committee to investigate, and that committee\r\nhears evidence three weeks, and all the witnesses on one side swear\r\nthat the accused took money or stock or something for his vote. Then\r\nthe accused stands up and testifies that he may have done it, but he was\r\nreceiving and handling a good deal of money at the time and he doesn't\r\nremember this particular circumstance--at least with sufficient\r\ndistinctness to enable him to grasp it tangibly. So of course the thing\r\nis not proven--and that is what they say in the verdict. They don't\r\nacquit, they don't condemn. They just say, 'Charge not proven.' It\r\nleaves the accused in a kind of a shaky condition before the country, it\r\npurifies Congress, it satisfies everybody, and it doesn't seriously hurt\r\nanybody. It has taken a long time to perfect our system, but it is the\r\nmost admirable in the world, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo one of those long stupid investigations always turns out in that\r\nlame silly way. Yes, you are correct. I thought maybe you viewed the\r\nmatter differently from other people. Do you think a Congress of ours\r\ncould convict the devil of anything if he were a member?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear boy, don't let these damaging delays prejudice you against\r\nCongress. Don't use such strong language; you talk like a newspaper.\r\nCongress has inflicted frightful punishments on its members--now you\r\nknow that. When they tried Mr. Fairoaks, and a cloud of witnesses\r\nproved him to be--well, you know what they proved him to be--and his own\r\ntestimony and his own confessions gave him the same character, what did\r\nCongress do then?--come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what did Congress do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what Congress did, Washington. Congress intimated plainly\r\nenough, that they considered him almost a stain upon their body; and\r\nwithout waiting ten days, hardly, to think the thing over, they rose up\r\nand hurled at him a resolution declaring that they disapproved of his\r\nconduct! Now you know that, Washington.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a terrific thing--there is no denying that. If he had been\r\nproven guilty of theft, arson, licentiousness, infanticide, and defiling\r\ngraves, I believe they would have suspended him for two days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can depend on it, Washington. Congress is vindictive, Congress is\r\nsavage, sir, when it gets waked up once. It will go to any length to\r\nvindicate its honor at such a time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh well, we have talked the morning through, just as usual in these\r\ntiresome days of waiting, and we have reached the same old result; that\r\nis to say, we are no better off than when we began. The land bill is\r\njust as far away as ever, and the trial is closer at hand. Let's give up\r\neverything and die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDie and leave the Duchess to fight it out all alone? Oh, no, that won't\r\ndo. Come, now, don't talk so. It is all going to come out right. Now\r\nyou'll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt never will, Colonel, never in the world. Something tells me that. I\r\nget more tired and more despondent every day. I don't see any hope; life\r\nis only just a trouble. I am so miserable, these days!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel made Washington get up and walk the floor with him, arm in\r\narm. The good old speculator wanted to comfort him, but he hardly knew\r\nhow to go about it. He made many attempts, but they were lame; they\r\nlacked spirit; the words were encouraging; but they were only words--he\r\ncould not get any heart into them. He could not always warm up, now,\r\nwith the old Hawkeye fervor. By and by his lips trembled and his voice\r\ngot unsteady. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't give up the ship, my boy--don't do it. The wind's bound to fetch\r\naround and set in our favor. I know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the prospect was so cheerful that he wept. Then he blew a\r\ntrumpet-blast that started the meshes of his handkerchief, and said in\r\nalmost his breezy old-time way:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord bless us, this is all nonsense! Night doesn't last always; day has\r\ngot to break some time or other. Every silver lining has a cloud behind\r\nit, as the poet says; and that remark has always cheered me; though--I\r\nnever could see any meaning to it. Everybody uses it, though, and\r\neverybody gets comfort out of it. I wish they would start something\r\nfresh. Come, now, let's cheer up; there's been as good fish in the sea\r\nas there are now. It shall never be said that Beriah Sellers-- Come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the telegraph boy. The Colonel reached for the message and\r\ndevoured its contents:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said it! Never give up the ship! The trial's postponed till February,\r\nand we'll save the child yet. Bless my life, what lawyers they have in\r\nNew-York! Give them money to fight with and the ghost of an excuse, and\r\nthey: would manage to postpone anything in this world, unless it might\r\nbe the millennium or something like that. Now for work again my boy. The\r\ntrial will last to the middle of March, sure; Congress ends the fourth\r\nof March. Within three days of the end of the session they will be done\r\nputting through the preliminaries then they will be ready for national\r\nbusiness. Our bill will go through in forty-eight hours, then, and we'll\r\ntelegraph a million dollars to the jury--to the lawyers, I mean--and\r\nthe verdict of the jury will be 'Accidental murder resulting from\r\njustifiable insanity'--or something to, that effect, something to that\r\neffect.--Everything is dead sure, now. Come, what is the matter? What\r\nare you wilting down like that, for? You mustn't be a girl, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Colonel, I am become so used to troubles, so used to failures,\r\ndisappointments, hard luck of all kinds, that a little good news breaks\r\nme right down. Everything has been so hopeless that now I can't stand\r\ngood news at all. It is too good to be true, anyway. Don't you see how\r\nour bad luck has worked on me? My hair is getting gray, and many nights\r\nI don't sleep at all. I wish it was all over and we could rest. I wish\r\nwe could lie down and just forget everything, and let it all be just a\r\ndream that is done and can't come back to trouble us any more. I am so\r\ntired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, poor child, don't talk like that-cheer up--there's daylight ahead.\r\nDon't give up. You'll have Laura again, and--Louise, and your mother,\r\nand oceans and oceans of money--and then you can go away, ever so far\r\naway somewhere, if you want to, and forget all about this infernal\r\nplace. And by George I'll go with you! I'll go with you--now there's my\r\nword on it. Cheer up. I'll run out and tell the friends the news.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he wrung Washington's hand and was about to hurry away when his\r\ncompanion, in a burst of grateful admiration said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you are the best soul and the noblest I ever knew, Colonel\r\nSellers! and if the people only knew you as I do, you would not be\r\ntagging around here a nameless man--you would be in Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gladness died out of the Colonel's face, and he laid his hand upon\r\nWashington's shoulder and said gravely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always been a friend of your family, Washington, and I think I\r\nhave always tried to do right as between man and man, according to my\r\nlights. Now I don't think there has ever been anything in my conduct\r\nthat should make you feel justified in saying a thing like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned, then, and walked slowly out, leaving Washington abashed and\r\nsomewhat bewildered. When Washington had presently got his thoughts\r\ninto line again, he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, honestly, I only meant to\r\ncompliment him--indeed I would not have hurt him for the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nThe weeks drifted by monotonously enough, now. The \xe2\x80\x9cpreliminaries\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n continued to drag along in Congress, and life was a dull suspense to\r\nSellers and Washington, a weary waiting which might have broken their\r\nhearts, maybe, but for the relieving change which they got out of an\r\noccasional visit to New York to see Laura. Standing guard in Washington\r\nor anywhere else is not an exciting business in time of peace, but\r\nstanding guard was all that the two friends had to do; all that was\r\nneeded of them was that they should be on hand and ready for any\r\nemergency that might come up. There was no work to do; that was all\r\nfinished; this was but the second session of the last winter's Congress,\r\nand its action on the bill could have but one result--its passage. The\r\nhouse must do its work over again, of course, but the same membership\r\nwas there to see that it did it.--The Senate was secure--Senator\r\nDilworthy was able to put all doubts to rest on that head. Indeed it was\r\nno secret in Washington that a two-thirds vote in the Senate was ready\r\nand waiting to be cast for the University bill as soon as it should come\r\nbefore that body.\r\n\r\nWashington did not take part in the gaieties of \xe2\x80\x9cthe season,\xe2\x80\x9d as he had\r\ndone the previous winter. He had lost his interest in such things; he\r\nwas oppressed with cares, now. Senator Dilworthy said to Washington that\r\nan humble deportment, under punishment, was best, and that there was but\r\none way in which the troubled heart might find perfect repose and peace.\r\nThe suggestion found a response in Washington's breast, and the Senator\r\nsaw the sign of it in his face.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment one could find the youth with the Senator even oftener\r\nthan with Col. Sellers. When the statesman presided at great temperance\r\nmeetings, he placed Washington in the front rank of impressive\r\ndignitaries that gave tone to the occasion and pomp to the platform. His\r\nbald headed surroundings made the youth the more conspicuous.\r\n\r\nWhen the statesman made remarks in these meetings, he not infrequently\r\nalluded with effect to the encouraging spectacle of one of the\r\nwealthiest and most brilliant young favorites of society forsaking\r\nthe light vanities of that butterfly existence to nobly and\r\nself-sacrificingly devote his talents and his riches to the cause of\r\nsaving his hapless fellow creatures from shame and misery here and\r\neternal regret hereafter.\r\n\r\nAt the prayer meetings the Senator always brought Washington up the\r\naisle on his arm and seated him prominently; in his prayers he\r\nreferred to him in the cant terms which the Senator employed, perhaps\r\nunconsciously, and mistook, maybe, for religion, and in other ways\r\nbrought him into notice. He had him out at gatherings for the benefit of\r\nthe negro, gatherings for the benefit of the Indian, gatherings for the\r\nbenefit of the heathen in distant lands. He had him out time and again,\r\nbefore Sunday Schools, as an example for emulation. Upon all these\r\noccasions the Senator made casual references to many benevolent\r\nenterprises which his ardent young friend was planning against the day\r\nwhen the passage of the University bill should make his means available\r\nfor the amelioration of the condition of the unfortunate among his\r\nfellow men of all nations and all climes. Thus as the weeks rolled on\r\nWashington grew up into an imposing lion once more, but a lion that\r\nroamed the peaceful fields of religion and temperance, and revisited the\r\nglittering domain of fashion no more. A great moral influence was thus\r\nbrought to bear in favor of the bill; the weightiest of friends flocked\r\nto its standard; its most energetic enemies said it was useless to fight\r\nlonger; they had tacitly surrendered while as yet the day of battle was\r\nnot come.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nThe session was drawing toward its close. Senator Dilworthy thought he\r\nwould run out west and shake hands with his constituents and let them\r\nlook at him. The legislature whose duty it would be to re-elect him\r\nto the United States Senate, was already in session. Mr. Dilworthy\r\nconsidered his re-election certain, but he was a careful, painstaking\r\nman, and if, by visiting his State he could find the opportunity to\r\npersuade a few more legislators to vote for him, he held the journey to\r\nbe well worth taking. The University bill was safe, now; he could leave\r\nit without fear; it needed his presence and his watching no longer. But\r\nthere was a person in his State legislature who did need watching--a\r\nperson who, Senator Dilworthy said, was a narrow, grumbling,\r\nuncomfortable malcontent--a person who was stolidly opposed to reform,\r\nand progress and him,--a person who, he feared, had been bought with\r\nmoney to combat him, and through him the commonwealth's welfare and its\r\npolitics' purity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf this person Noble,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Dilworthy, in a little speech at a\r\ndinner party given him by some of his admirers, \xe2\x80\x9cmerely desired to\r\nsacrifice me.--I would willingly offer up my political life on the altar\r\nof my dear State's weal, I would be glad and grateful to do it; but when\r\nhe makes of me but a cloak to hide his deeper designs, when he proposes\r\nto strike through me at the heart of my beloved State, all the lion\r\nin me is roused--and I say, Here I stand, solitary and alone, but\r\nunflinching, unquailing, thrice armed with my sacred trust; and whoso\r\npasses, to do evil to this fair domain that looks to me for protection,\r\nmust do so over my dead body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe further said that if this Noble were a pure man, and merely\r\nmisguided, he could bear it, but that he should succeed in his wicked\r\ndesigns through a base use of money would leave a blot upon his State\r\nwhich would work untold evil to the morals of the people, and that he\r\nwould not suffer; the public morals must not be contaminated. He would\r\nseek this man Noble; he would argue, he would persuade, he would appeal\r\nto his honor.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived on the ground he found his friends unterrified; they\r\nwere standing firmly by him and were full of courage. Noble was\r\nworking hard, too, but matters were against him, he was not making much\r\nprogress. Mr. Dilworthy took an early opportunity to send for Mr. Noble;\r\nhe had a midnight interview with him, and urged him to forsake his evil\r\nways; he begged him to come again and again, which he did. He finally\r\nsent the man away at 3 o'clock one morning; and when he was gone, Mr.\r\nDilworthy said to himself,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel a good deal relieved, now, a great deal relieved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Senator now turned his attention to matters touching the souls of\r\nhis people. He appeared in church; he took a leading part in prayer\r\nmeetings; he met and encouraged the temperance societies; he graced the\r\nsewing circles of the ladies with his presence, and even took a needle\r\nnow and then and made a stitch or two upon a calico shirt for some poor\r\nBibleless pagan of the South Seas, and this act enchanted the ladies,\r\nwho regarded the garments thus honored as in a manner sanctified. The\r\nSenator wrought in Bible classes, and nothing could keep him away from\r\nthe Sunday Schools--neither sickness nor storms nor weariness. He even\r\ntraveled a tedious thirty miles in a poor little rickety stagecoach to\r\ncomply with the desire of the miserable hamlet of Cattleville that he\r\nwould let its Sunday School look upon him.\r\n\r\nAll the town was assembled at the stage office when he arrived, two\r\nbonfires were burning, and a battery of anvils was popping exultant\r\nbroadsides; for a United States Senator was a sort of god in the\r\nunderstanding of these people who never had seen any creature mightier\r\nthan a county judge. To them a United States Senator was a vast, vague\r\ncolossus, an awe inspiring unreality.\r\n\r\nNext day everybody was at the village church a full half hour before\r\ntime for Sunday School to open; ranchmen and farmers had come with their\r\nfamilies from five miles around, all eager to get a glimpse of the\r\ngreat man--the man who had been to Washington; the man who had seen the\r\nPresident of the United States, and had even talked with him; the man\r\nwho had seen the actual Washington Monument--perhaps touched it with his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nWhen the Senator arrived the Church was crowded, the windows were full,\r\nthe aisles were packed, so was the vestibule, and so indeed was the yard\r\nin front of the building. As he worked his way through to the pulpit\r\non the arm of the minister and followed by the envied officials of\r\nthe village, every neck was stretched and, every eye twisted around\r\nintervening obstructions to get a glimpse. Elderly people directed each\r\nother's attention and, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere! that's him, with the grand, noble\r\nforehead!\xe2\x80\x9d Boys nudged each other and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHi, Johnny, here he is,\r\nthere, that's him, with the peeled head!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Senator took his seat in the pulpit, with the minister on one side\r\nof him and the Superintendent of the Sunday School on the other. The\r\ntown dignitaries sat in an impressive row within the altar railings\r\nbelow. The Sunday School children occupied ten of the front benches\r\ndressed in their best and most uncomfortable clothes, and with hair\r\ncombed and faces too clean to feel natural. So awed were they by the\r\npresence of a living United States Senator, that during three minutes\r\nnot a \xe2\x80\x9cspit ball\xe2\x80\x9d was thrown. After that they began to come to\r\nthemselves by degrees, and presently the spell was wholly gone and they\r\nwere reciting verses and pulling hair.\r\n\r\nThe usual Sunday School exercises were hurried through, and then\r\nthe minister, got up and bored the house with a speech built on the\r\ncustomary Sunday School plan; then the Superintendent put in his oar;\r\nthen the town dignitaries had their say. They all made complimentary\r\nreference to \xe2\x80\x9ctheir friend the Senator,\xe2\x80\x9d and told what a great and\r\nillustrious man he was and what he had done for his country and for\r\nreligion and temperance, and exhorted the little boys to be good and\r\ndiligent and try to become like him some day. The speakers won the\r\ndeathless hatred of the house by these delays, but at last there was an\r\nend and hope revived; inspiration was about to find utterance.\r\n\r\nSenator Dilworthy rose and beamed upon the assemblage for a full minute\r\nin silence. Then he smiled with an access of sweetness upon the children\r\nand began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy little friends--for I hope that all these bright-faced little people\r\nare my friends and will let me be their friend--my little friends,\r\nI have traveled much, I have been in many cities and many States,\r\neverywhere in our great and noble country, and by the blessing of\r\nProvidence I have been permitted to see many gatherings like this--but I\r\nam proud, I am truly proud to say that I never have looked upon so much\r\nintelligence, so much grace, such sweetness of disposition as I see in\r\nthe charming young countenances I see before me at this moment. I have\r\nbeen asking myself as I sat here, Where am I? Am I in some far-off\r\nmonarchy, looking upon little princes and princesses? No. Am I in some\r\npopulous centre of my own country, where the choicest children of the\r\nland have been selected and brought together as at a fair for a prize?\r\nNo. Am I in some strange foreign clime where the children are marvels\r\nthat we know not of? No. Then where am I? Yes--where am I? I am in a\r\nsimple, remote, unpretending settlement of my own dear State, and these\r\nare the children of the noble and virtuous men who have made me what I\r\nam! My soul is lost in wonder at the thought! And I humbly thank Him to\r\nwhom we are but as worms of the dust, that he has been pleased to call\r\nme to serve such men! Earth has no higher, no grander position for me.\r\nLet kings and emperors keep their tinsel crowns, I want them not; my\r\nheart is here!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgain I thought, Is this a theatre? No. Is it a concert or a gilded\r\nopera? No. Is it some other vain, brilliant, beautiful temple of\r\nsoul-staining amusement and hilarity? No. Then what is it? What did\r\nmy consciousness reply? I ask you, my little friends, What did my\r\nconsciousness reply? It replied, It is the temple of the Lord! Ah, think\r\nof that, now. I could hardly keep the tears back, I was so grateful. Oh,\r\nhow beautiful it is to see these ranks of sunny little faces assembled\r\nhere to learn the way of life; to learn to be good; to learn to be\r\nuseful; to learn to be pious; to learn to be great and glorious men and\r\nwomen; to learn to be props and pillars of the State and shining lights\r\nin the councils and the households of the nation; to be bearers of the\r\nbanner and soldiers of the cross in the rude campaigns of life, and\r\nraptured souls in the happy fields of Paradise hereafter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChildren, honor your parents and be grateful to them for providing for\r\nyou the precious privileges of a Sunday School.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow my dear little friends, sit up straight and pretty--there, that's\r\nit--and give me your attention and let me tell you about a poor little\r\nSunday School scholar I once knew.--He lived in the far west, and his\r\nparents were poor. They could not give him a costly education; but they\r\nwere good and wise and they sent him to the Sunday School. He loved the\r\nSunday School. I hope you love your Sunday School--ah, I see by your\r\nfaces that you do! That is right!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this poor little boy was always in his place when the bell rang,\r\nand he always knew his lesson; for his teachers wanted him to learn and\r\nhe loved his teachers dearly. Always love your teachers, my children,\r\nfor they love you more than you can know, now. He would not let bad boys\r\npersuade him to go to play on Sunday. There was one little bad boy who\r\nwas always trying to persuade him, but he never could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo this poor little boy grew up to be a man, and had to go out in the\r\nworld, far from home and friends to earn his living. Temptations lay all\r\nabout him, and sometimes he was about to yield, but he would think of\r\nsome precious lesson he learned in his Sunday School a long time\r\nago, and that would save him. By and by he was elected to the\r\nlegislature--Then he did everything he could for Sunday Schools. He\r\ngot laws passed for them; he got Sunday Schools established wherever he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd by and by the people made him governor--and he said it was all\r\nowing to the Sunday School.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter a while the people elected him a Representative to the Congress\r\nof the United States, and he grew very famous.--Now temptations assailed\r\nhim on every hand. People tried to get him to drink wine; to dance, to\r\ngo to theatres; they even tried to buy his vote; but no, the memory of\r\nhis Sunday School saved him from all harm; he remembered the fate of\r\nthe bad little boy who used to try to get him to play on Sunday, and who\r\ngrew up and became a drunkard and was hanged. He remembered that, and\r\nwas glad he never yielded and played on Sunday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, at last, what do you think happened? Why the people gave him a\r\ntowering, illustrious position, a grand, imposing position. And what do\r\nyou think it was? What should you say it was, children? It was Senator\r\nof the United States! That poor little boy that loved his Sunday School\r\nbecame that man. That man stands before you! All that he is, he owes to\r\nthe Sunday School.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy precious children, love your parents, love your teachers, love your\r\nSunday School, be pious, be obedient, be honest, be diligent, and then\r\nyou will succeed in life and be honored of all men. Above all things, my\r\nchildren, be honest. Above all things be pure-minded as the snow. Let us\r\njoin in prayer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Senator Dilworthy departed from Cattleville, he left three dozen\r\nboys behind him arranging a campaign of life whose objective point was\r\nthe United States Senate.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at the State capital at midnight Mr. Noble came and held\r\na three-hours' conference with him, and then as he was about leaving\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI've worked hard, and I've got them at last. Six of them haven't got\r\nquite back-bone enough to slew around and come right out for you on the\r\nfirst ballot to-morrow; but they're going to vote against you on the\r\nfirst for the sake of appearances, and then come out for you all in a\r\nbody on the second--I've fixed all that! By supper time to-morrow you'll\r\nbe re-elected. You can go to bed and sleep easy on that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Noble was gone, the Senator said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to bring about a complexion of things like this was worth coming\r\nWest for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nThe case of the State of New York against Laura Hawkins was finally set\r\ndown for trial on the 15th day of February, less than a year after the\r\nshooting of George Selby.\r\n\r\nIf the public had almost forgotten the existence of Laura and her crime,\r\nthey were reminded of all the details of the murder by the newspapers,\r\nwhich for some days had been announcing the approaching trial. But they\r\nhad not forgotten. The sex, the age, the beauty of the prisoner; her\r\nhigh social position in Washington, the unparalled calmness with which\r\nthe crime was committed had all conspired to fix the event in the public\r\nmind, although nearly three hundred and sixty-five subsequent murders\r\nhad occurred to vary the monotony of metropolitan life.\r\n\r\nNo, the public read from time to time of the lovely prisoner,\r\nlanguishing in the city prison, the tortured victim of the law's delay;\r\nand as the months went by it was natural that the horror of her crime\r\nshould become a little indistinct in memory, while the heroine of it\r\nshould be invested with a sort of sentimental interest. Perhaps her\r\ncounsel had calculated on this. Perhaps it was by their advice that\r\nLaura had interested herself in the unfortunate criminals who shared her\r\nprison confinement, and had done not a little to relieve, from her own\r\npurse, the necessities of some of the poor creatures. That she had\r\ndone this, the public read in the journals of the day, and the simple\r\nannouncement cast a softening light upon her character.\r\n\r\nThe court room was crowded at an early hour, before the arrival of\r\njudges, lawyers and prisoner. There is no enjoyment so keen to certain\r\nminds as that of looking upon the slow torture of a human being on\r\ntrial for life, except it be an execution; there is no display of human\r\ningenuity, wit and power so fascinating as that made by trained lawyers\r\nin the trial of an important case, nowhere else is exhibited such\r\nsubtlety, acumen, address, eloquence.\r\n\r\nAll the conditions of intense excitement meet in a murder trial. The\r\nawful issue at stake gives significance to the lightest word or look.\r\nHow the quick eyes of the spectators rove from the stolid jury to the\r\nkeen lawyers, the impassive judge, the anxious prisoner. Nothing is\r\nlost of the sharp wrangle of the counsel on points of law, the measured\r\ndecision's of the bench; the duels between the attorneys and the\r\nwitnesses. The crowd sways with the rise and fall of the shifting\r\ntestimony, in sympathetic interest, and hangs upon the dicta of the\r\njudge in breathless silence. It speedily takes sides for or against\r\nthe accused, and recognizes as quickly its favorites among the lawyers.\r\nNothing delights it more than the sharp retort of a witness and the\r\ndiscomfiture of an obnoxious attorney. A joke, even if it be a lame\r\none, is no where so keenly relished or quickly applauded as in a murder\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nWithin the bar the young lawyers and the privileged hangers-on filled\r\nall the chairs except those reserved at the table for those engaged in\r\nthe case. Without, the throng occupied all the seats, the window ledges\r\nand the standing room. The atmosphere was already something horrible. It\r\nwas the peculiar odor of a criminal court, as if it were tainted by the\r\npresence, in different persons, of all the crimes that men and women can\r\ncommit.\r\n\r\nThere was a little stir when the Prosecuting Attorney, with two\r\nassistants, made his way in, seated himself at the table, and spread his\r\npapers before him. There was more stir when the counsel of the defense\r\nappeared. They were Mr. Braham, the senior, and Mr. Quiggle and Mr.\r\nO'Keefe, the juniors.\r\n\r\nEverybody in the court room knew Mr. Braham, the great criminal lawyer,\r\nand he was not unaware that he was the object of all eyes as he moved\r\nto his place, bowing to his friends in the bar. A large but rather spare\r\nman, with broad shoulders and a massive head, covered with chestnut\r\ncurls which fell down upon his coat collar and which he had a habit\r\nof shaking as a lion is supposed to shake his mane. His face was clean\r\nshaven, and he had a wide mouth and rather small dark eyes, set quite\r\ntoo near together. Mr. Braham wore a brown frock coat buttoned\r\nacross his breast, with a rose-bud in the upper buttonhole, and light\r\npantaloons. A diamond stud was seen to flash from his bosom; and as he\r\nseated himself and drew off his gloves a heavy seal ring was displayed\r\nupon his white left hand. Mr. Braham having seated himself, deliberately\r\nsurveyed the entire house, made a remark to one of his assistants, and\r\nthen taking an ivory-handled knife from his pocket began to pare his\r\nfinger nails, rocking his chair backwards and forwards slowly.\r\n\r\nA moment later Judge O'Shaunnessy entered at the rear door and took\r\nhis seat in one of the chairs behind the bench; a gentleman in black\r\nbroadcloth, with sandy hair, inclined to curl, a round, reddish\r\nand rather jovial face, sharp rather than intellectual, and with a\r\nself-sufficient air. His career had nothing remarkable in it. He was\r\ndescended from a long line of Irish Kings, and he was the first one of\r\nthem who had ever come into his kingdom--the kingdom of such being the\r\ncity of New York. He had, in fact, descended so far and so low that he\r\nfound himself, when a boy, a sort of street Arab in that city; but\r\nhe had ambition and native shrewdness, and he speedily took to\r\nboot-polishing, and newspaper hawking, became the office and errand\r\nboy of a law firm, picked up knowledge enough to get some employment\r\nin police courts, was admitted to the bar, became a rising young\r\npolitician, went to the legislature, and was finally elected to the\r\nbench which he now honored. In this democratic country he was obliged\r\nto conceal his royalty under a plebeian aspect. Judge O'Shaunnessy never\r\nhad a lucrative practice nor a large salary but he had prudently laid\r\naway money--believing that a dependant judge can never be impartial--and\r\nhe had lands and houses to the value of three or four hundred thousand\r\ndollars. Had he not helped to build and furnish this very Court House?\r\nDid he not know that the very \xe2\x80\x9cspittoon\xe2\x80\x9d which his judgeship used cost\r\nthe city the sum of one thousand dollars?\r\n\r\nAs soon as the judge was seated, the court was opened with the \xe2\x80\x9coi yis,\r\noi yis\xe2\x80\x9d of the officer in his native language, the case called, and\r\nthe sheriff was directed to bring in the prisoner. In the midst of a\r\nprofound hush Laura entered, leaning on the arm of the officer, and was\r\nconducted to a seat by her counsel. She was followed by her mother and\r\nby Washington Hawkins, who were given seats near her.\r\n\r\nLaura was very pale, but this pallor heightened the lustre of her large\r\neyes and gave a touching sadness to her expressive face. She was dressed\r\nin simple black, with exquisite taste, and without an ornament. The thin\r\nlace vail which partially covered her face did not so much conceal as\r\nheighten her beauty. She would not have entered a drawing room with more\r\nself-poise, nor a church with more haughty humility. There was in her\r\nmanner or face neither shame nor boldness, and when she took her seat\r\nin full view of half the spectators, her eyes were downcast. A murmur\r\nof admiration ran through the room. The newspaper reporters made their\r\npencils fly. Mr. Braham again swept his eyes over the house as if in\r\napproval. When Laura at length raised her eyes a little, she saw Philip\r\nand Harry within the bar, but she gave no token of recognition.\r\n\r\nThe clerk then read the indictment, which was in the usual form. It\r\ncharged Laura Hawkins, in effect, with the premeditated murder of George\r\nSelby, by shooting him with a pistol, with a revolver, shotgun, rifle,\r\nrepeater, breech-loader, cannon, six-shooter, with a gun, or some other\r\nweapon; with killing him with a slung-shot, a bludgeon, carving knife,\r\nbowie knife, pen knife, rolling pin, car, hook, dagger, hair pin, with a\r\nhammer, with a screw-driver, with a nail, and with all other weapons and\r\nutensils whatsoever, at the Southern hotel and in all other hotels and\r\nplaces wheresoever, on the thirteenth day of March and all other days of\r\nthe Christian era wheresoever.\r\n\r\nLaura stood while the long indictment was read; and at the end, in\r\nresponse to the inquiry, of the judge, she said in a clear, low voice;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d She sat down and the court proceeded to impanel a jury.\r\n\r\nThe first man called was Michael Lanigan, saloon keeper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you formed or expressed any opinion on this case, and do you know\r\nany of the parties?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot any,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Lanigan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you any conscientious objections to capital punishment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, not to my knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you read anything about this case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, I read the papers, y'r Honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nObjected to by Mr. Braham, for cause, and discharged.\r\n\r\nPatrick Coughlin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--I haven't got any particular business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven't any particular business, eh? Well, what's your general\r\nbusiness? What do you do for a living?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI own some terriers, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOwn some terriers, eh? Keep a rat pit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen comes there to have a little sport. I never fit 'em, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I see--you are probably the amusement committee of the city\r\ncouncil. Have you ever heard of this case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot till this morning, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you read?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot fine print, y'r Honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man was about to be sworn, when Mr. Braham asked,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould your father read?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old gentleman was mighty handy at that, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Braham submitted that the man was disqualified. Judge thought not.\r\nPoint argued. Challenged peremptorily, and set aside.\r\n\r\nEthan Dobb, cart-driver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you read?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but haven't a habit of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard of this case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so--but it might be another. I have no opinion about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDist. A. \xe2\x80\x9cTha--tha--there! Hold on a bit? Did anybody tell you to say\r\nyou had no opinion about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN--n--o, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care now, take care. Then what suggested it to you to volunteer\r\nthat remark?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey've always asked that, when I was on juries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, then. Have you any conscientious scruples about capital\r\npunishment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny which?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you object to finding a person guilty--of murder on evidence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might, sir, if I thought he wan't guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe district attorney thought he saw a point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould this feeling rather incline you against a capital conviction?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe juror said he hadn't any feeling, and didn't know any of the\r\nparties. Accepted and sworn.\r\n\r\nDennis Lafin, laborer. Have neither formed nor expressed an opinion.\r\nNever had heard of the case. Believed in hangin' for them that deserved\r\nit. Could read if it was necessary.\r\n\r\nMr. Braham objected. The man was evidently bloody minded. Challenged\r\nperemptorily.\r\n\r\nLarry O'Toole, contractor. A showily dressed man of the style known\r\nas \xe2\x80\x9cvulgar genteel,\xe2\x80\x9d had a sharp eye and a ready tongue. Had read the\r\nnewspaper reports of the case, but they made no impression on him.\r\nShould be governed by the evidence. Knew no reason why he could not be\r\nan impartial juror.\r\n\r\nQuestion by District Attorney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it that the reports made no impression on you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever believe anything I see in the newspapers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(Laughter from the crowd, approving smiles from his Honor and Mr.\r\nBraham.) Juror sworn in. Mr. Braham whispered to O'Keefe, \xe2\x80\x9cthat's the\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAvery Hicks, pea-nut peddler. Did he ever hear of this case? The man\r\nshook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you read?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAny scruples about capital punishment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was about to be sworn, when the district attorney turning to him\r\ncarelessly, remarked,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnderstand the nature of an oath?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOutside,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, pointing to the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, do you know what an oath is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive cents,\xe2\x80\x9d explained the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to insult me?\xe2\x80\x9d roared the prosecuting officer. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you an\r\nidiot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFresh baked. I'm deefe. I don't hear a word you say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man was discharged. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wouldn't have made a bad juror, though,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n whispered Braham. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw him looking at the prisoner sympathizingly.\r\nThat's a point you want to watch for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe result of the whole day's work was the selection of only two jurors.\r\nThese however were satisfactory to Mr. Braham. He had kept off all those\r\nhe did not know. No one knew better than this great criminal lawyer\r\nthat the battle was fought on the selection of the jury. The subsequent\r\nexamination of witnesses, the eloquence expended on the jury are all\r\nfor effect outside. At least that is the theory of Mr. Braham. But human\r\nnature is a queer thing, he admits; sometimes jurors are unaccountably\r\nswayed, be as careful as you can in choosing them.\r\n\r\nIt was four weary days before this jury was made up, but when it was\r\nfinally complete, it did great credit to the counsel for the defence.\r\nSo far as Mr. Braham knew, only two could read, one of whom was the\r\nforeman, Mr. Braham's friend, the showy contractor. Low foreheads and\r\nheavy faces they all had; some had a look of animal cunning, while the\r\nmost were only stupid. The entire panel formed that boasted heritage\r\ncommonly described as the \xe2\x80\x9cbulwark of our liberties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe District Attorney, Mr. McFlinn, opened the case for the state. He\r\nspoke with only the slightest accent, one that had been inherited but\r\nnot cultivated. He contented himself with a brief statement of the case.\r\nThe state would prove that Laura Hawkins, the prisoner at the bar,\r\na fiend in the form of a beautiful woman, shot dead George Selby, a\r\nSouthern gentleman, at the time and place described. That the murder was\r\nin cold blood, deliberate and without provocation; that it had been long\r\npremeditated and threatened; that she had followed the deceased from\r\nWashington to commit it. All this would be proved by unimpeachable\r\nwitnesses. The attorney added that the duty of the jury, however painful\r\nit might be, would be plain and simple. They were citizens, husbands,\r\nperhaps fathers. They knew how insecure life had become in the\r\nmetropolis. Tomorrow our own wives might be widows, their own children\r\norphans, like the bereaved family in yonder hotel, deprived of husband\r\nand father by the jealous hand of some murderous female.

Requested by the District Attorney to tell\r\nthe jury all he knew about the killing, he narrated the circumstances\r\nsubstantially as the reader already knows them.\r\n\r\nHe accompanied Miss Hawkins to New York at her request, supposing she\r\nwas coming in relation to a bill then pending in Congress, to secure\r\nthe attendance of absent members. Her note to him was here shown. She\r\nappeared to be very much excited at the Washington station. After she\r\nhad asked the conductor several questions, he heard her say, \xe2\x80\x9cHe can't\r\nescape.\xe2\x80\x9d Witness asked her \xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d and she replied \xe2\x80\x9cNobody.\xe2\x80\x9d Did not see\r\nher during the night. They traveled in a sleeping car. In the morning\r\nshe appeared not to have slept, said she had a headache. In crossing the\r\nferry she asked him about the shipping in sight; he pointed out where\r\nthe Cunarders lay when in port. They took a cup of coffee that morning\r\nat a restaurant. She said she was anxious to reach the Southern Hotel\r\nwhere Mr. Simons, one of the absent members, was staying, before he went\r\nout. She was entirely self-possessed, and beyond unusual excitement did\r\nnot act unnaturally. After she had fired twice at Col. Selby, she turned\r\nthe pistol towards her own breast, and witness snatched it from her.\r\nShe had been a great deal with Selby in Washington, appeared to be\r\ninfatuated with him.\r\n\r\n(Cross-examined by Mr. Braham.) \xe2\x80\x9cMist-er.....er Brierly!\xe2\x80\x9d (Mr. Braham\r\nhad in perfection this lawyer's trick of annoying a witness, by drawling\r\nout the \xe2\x80\x9cMister,\xe2\x80\x9d as if unable to recall the name, until the witness is\r\nsufficiently aggravated, and then suddenly, with a rising inflection,\r\nflinging his name at him with startling unexpectedness.) \xe2\x80\x9cMist-er.....er\r\nBrierly! What is your occupation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCivil Engineer, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, civil engineer, (with a glance at the jury). Following that\r\noccupation with Miss Hawkins?\xe2\x80\x9d (Smiles by the jury).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry, reddening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long have you known the prisoner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo years, sir. I made her acquaintance in Hawkeye, Missouri.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM.....m...m. Mist-er.....er Brierly! Were you not a lover of Miss\r\nHawkins?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nObjected to. \xe2\x80\x9cI submit, your Honor, that I have the right to establish\r\nthe relation of this unwilling witness to the prisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d Admitted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry hesitatingly, \xe2\x80\x9cwe were friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou act like a friend!\xe2\x80\x9d (sarcastically.) The jury were beginning to\r\nhate this neatly dressed young sprig. \xe2\x80\x9cMister......er....Brierly! Didn't\r\nMiss Hawkins refuse you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarry blushed and stammered and looked at the judge. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must answer,\r\nsir,\xe2\x80\x9d said His Honor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe--she--didn't accept me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I should think not. Brierly do you dare tell the jury that you had\r\nnot an interest in the removal of your rival, Col. Selby?\xe2\x80\x9d roared Mr.\r\nBraham in a voice of thunder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing like this, sir, nothing like this,\xe2\x80\x9d protested the witness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat's all, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Braham severely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne word,\xe2\x80\x9d said the District Attorney. \xe2\x80\x9cHad you the least suspicion of\r\nthe prisoner's intention, up to the moment of the shooting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the least,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Harry earnestly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not, of course not,\xe2\x80\x9d nodded Mr. Braham to the jury.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution then put upon the stand the other witnesses of the\r\nshooting at the hotel, and the clerk and the attending physicians. The\r\nfact of the homicide was clearly established. Nothing new was elicited,\r\nexcept from the clerk, in reply to a question by Mr. Braham, the fact\r\nthat when the prisoner enquired for Col. Selby she appeared excited and\r\nthere was a wild look in her eyes.\r\n\r\nThe dying deposition of Col. Selby was then produced. It set forth\r\nLaura's threats, but there was a significant addition to it, which the\r\nnewspaper report did not have. It seemed that after the deposition\r\nwas taken as reported, the Colonel was told for the first time by his\r\nphysicians that his wounds were mortal. He appeared to be in great\r\nmental agony and fear; and said he had not finished his deposition.\r\nHe added, with great difficulty and long pauses these words.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--have--not--told--all. I must tell--put--it--down--I--wronged--her.\r\nYears--ago--I--can't see--O--God--I--deserved----\xe2\x80\x9d That was all. He\r\nfainted and did not revive again.\r\n\r\nThe Washington railway conductor testified that the prisoner had\r\nasked him if a gentleman and his family went out on the evening train,\r\ndescribing the persons he had since learned were Col. Selby and family.\r\n\r\nSusan Cullum, colored servant at Senator Dilworthy's, was sworn. Knew\r\nCol. Selby. Had seen him come to the house often, and be alone in the\r\nparlor with Miss Hawkins. He came the day but one before he was shot.\r\nShe let him in. He appeared flustered like. She heard talking in the\r\nparlor, 'peared like it was quarrelin'. Was afeared sumfin' was wrong:\r\nJust put her ear to--the--keyhole of the back parlor-door. Heard a man's\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9cI--can't--I can't, Good God,\xe2\x80\x9d quite beggin' like. Heard--young\r\nMiss' voice, \xe2\x80\x9cTake your choice, then. If you 'bandon me, you knows\r\nwhat to 'spect.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he rushes outen the house, I goes in--and I\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9cMissis did you ring?\xe2\x80\x9d She was a standin' like a tiger, her eyes\r\nflashin'. I come right out.\r\n\r\nThis was the substance of Susan's testimony, which was not shaken in the\r\nleast by severe cross-examination. In reply to Mr. Braham's question, if\r\nthe prisoner did not look insane, Susan said, \xe2\x80\x9cLord; no, sir, just mad\r\nas a hawnet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington Hawkins was sworn. The pistol, identified by the officer as\r\nthe one used in the homicide, was produced Washington admitted that it\r\nwas his. She had asked him for it one morning, saying she thought she\r\nhad heard burglars the night before. Admitted that he never had heard\r\nburglars in the house. Had anything unusual happened just before that?\r\nNothing that he remembered. Did he accompany her to a reception at Mrs.\r\nShoonmaker's a day or two before? Yes. What occurred? Little by little\r\nit was dragged out of the witness that Laura had behaved strangely\r\nthere, appeared to be sick, and he had taken her home. Upon being pushed\r\nhe admitted that she had afterwards confessed that she saw Selby there.\r\nAnd Washington volunteered the statement that Selby, was a black-hearted\r\nvillain.\r\n\r\nThe District Attorney said, with some annoyance; \xe2\x80\x9cThere--there! That\r\nwill do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe defence declined to examine Mr. Hawkins at present. The case for\r\nthe prosecution was closed. Of the murder there could not be the least\r\ndoubt, or that the prisoner followed the deceased to New York with a\r\nmurderous intent. On the evidence the jury must convict, and might do so\r\nwithout leaving their seats. This was the condition of the case two\r\ndays after the jury had been selected. A week had passed since the trial\r\nopened; and a Sunday had intervened.\r\n\r\nThe public who read the reports of the evidence saw no chance for the\r\nprisoner's escape. The crowd of spectators who had watched the trial\r\nwere moved with the most profound sympathy for Laura.\r\n\r\nMr. Braham opened the case for the defence. His manner was subdued, and\r\nhe spoke in so low a voice that it was only by reason of perfect silence\r\nin the court room that he could be heard. He spoke very distinctly,\r\nhowever, and if his nationality could be discovered in his speech it was\r\nonly in a certain richness and breadth of tone.\r\n\r\nHe began by saying that he trembled at the responsibility he had\r\nundertaken; and he should altogether despair, if he did not see before\r\nhim a jury of twelve men of rare intelligence, whose acute minds would\r\nunravel all the sophistries of the prosecution, men with a sense of\r\nhonor, which would revolt at the remorseless persecution of this hunted\r\nwoman by the state, men with hearts to feel for the wrongs of which\r\nshe was the victim. Far be it from him to cast any suspicion upon the\r\nmotives of the able, eloquent and ingenious lawyers of the state;\r\nthey act officially; their business is to convict. It is our business,\r\ngentlemen, to see that justice is done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my duty, gentlemen, to unfold to you one of the most affecting\r\ndramas in all the history of misfortune. I shall have to show you\r\na life, the sport of fate and circumstances, hurried along through\r\nshifting storm and sun, bright with trusting innocence and anon black\r\nwith heartless villainy, a career which moves on in love and desertion\r\nand anguish, always hovered over by the dark spectre of INSANITY--an\r\ninsanity hereditary and induced by mental torture,--until it ends, if\r\nend it must in your verdict, by one of those fearful accidents, which\r\nare inscrutable to men and of which God alone knows the secret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, I shall ask you to go with me away from this court room\r\nand its minions of the law, away from the scene of this tragedy, to a\r\ndistant, I wish I could say a happier day. The story I have to tell is\r\nof a lovely little girl, with sunny hair and laughing eyes, traveling\r\nwith her parents, evidently people of wealth and refinement, upon a\r\nMississippi steamboat. There is an explosion, one of those terrible\r\ncatastrophes which leave the imprint of an unsettled mind upon the\r\nsurvivors. Hundreds of mangled remains are sent into eternity. When the\r\nwreck is cleared away this sweet little girl is found among the panic\r\nstricken survivors in the midst of a scene of horror enough to turn the\r\nsteadiest brain. Her parents have disappeared. Search even for their\r\nbodies is in vain. The bewildered, stricken child--who can say what\r\nchanges the fearful event wrought in her tender brain--clings to the\r\nfirst person who shows her sympathy. It is Mrs. Hawkins, this good\r\nlady who is still her loving friend. Laura is adopted into the Hawkins\r\nfamily. Perhaps she forgets in time that she is not their child. She is\r\nan orphan. No, gentlemen, I will not deceive you, she is not an orphan.\r\nWorse than that. There comes another day of agony. She knows that her\r\nfather lives. Who is he, where is he? Alas, I cannot tell you. Through\r\nthe scenes of this painful history he flits here and there a lunatic! If\r\nhe seeks his daughter, it is the purposeless search of a lunatic, as one\r\nwho wanders bereft of reason, crying where is my child? Laura seeks her\r\nfather. In vain just as she is about to find him, again and again-he\r\ndisappears, he is gone, he vanishes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is only the prologue to the tragedy. Bear with me while I\r\nrelate it. (Mr. Braham takes out a handkerchief, unfolds it slowly;\r\ncrashes it in his nervous hand, and throws it on the table). Laura grew\r\nup in her humble southern home, a beautiful creature, the joy of the\r\nhouse, the pride of the neighborhood, the loveliest flower in all the\r\nsunny south. She might yet have been happy; she was happy. But the\r\ndestroyer came into this paradise. He plucked the sweetest bud that grew\r\nthere, and having enjoyed its odor, trampled it in the mire beneath his\r\nfeet. George Selby, the deceased, a handsome, accomplished Confederate\r\nColonel, was this human fiend. He deceived her with a mock marriage;\r\nafter some months he brutally abandoned her, and spurned her as if she\r\nwere a contemptible thing; all the time he had a wife in New Orleans.\r\nLaura was crushed. For weeks, as I shall show you by the testimony of\r\nher adopted mother and brother, she hovered over death in delirium.\r\nGentlemen, did she ever emerge from this delirium? I shall show you that\r\nwhen she recovered her health, her mind was changed, she was not what\r\nshe had been. You can judge yourselves whether the tottering reason ever\r\nrecovered its throne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYears pass. She is in Washington, apparently the happy favorite of\r\na brilliant society. Her family have become enormously rich by one\r\nof those sudden turns in fortune that the inhabitants of America are\r\nfamiliar with--the discovery of immense mineral wealth in some wild\r\nlands owned by them. She is engaged in a vast philanthropic scheme for\r\nthe benefit of the poor, by the use of this wealth. But, alas, even here\r\nand now, the same relentless fate pursued her. The villain Selby appears\r\nagain upon the scene, as if on purpose to complete the ruin of her life.\r\nHe appeared to taunt her with her dishonor, he threatened exposure if\r\nshe did not become again the mistress of his passion. Gentlemen, do you\r\nwonder if this woman, thus pursued, lost her reason, was beside herself\r\nwith fear, and that her wrongs preyed upon her mind until she was no\r\nlonger responsible for her acts? I turn away my head as one who would\r\nnot willingly look even upon the just vengeance of Heaven. (Mr. Braham\r\npaused as if overcome by his emotions. Mrs. Hawkins and Washington were\r\nin tears, as were many of the spectators also. The jury looked scared.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, in this condition of affairs it needed but a spark--I do not\r\nsay a suggestion, I do not say a hint--from this butterfly Brierly; this\r\nrejected rival, to cause the explosion. I make no charges, but if this\r\nwoman was in her right mind when she fled from Washington and reached\r\nthis city in company--with Brierly, then I do not know what insanity\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Braham sat down, he felt that he had the jury with him. A burst\r\nof applause followed, which the officer promptly, suppressed. Laura,\r\nwith tears in her eyes, turned a grateful look upon her counsel. All the\r\nwomen among the spectators saw the tears and wept also. They thought as\r\nthey also looked at Mr. Braham, how handsome he is!\r\n\r\nMrs. Hawkins took the stand. She was somewhat confused to be the target\r\nof so many, eyes, but her honest and good face at once told in Laura's\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Hawkins,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Braham, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you' be kind enough to state the\r\ncircumstances of your finding Laura?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI object,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. McFlinn; rising to his feet. \xe2\x80\x9cThis has nothing\r\nwhatever to do with the case, your honor. I am surprised at it, even\r\nafter the extraordinary speech of my learned friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you propose to connect it, Mr. Braham?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the judge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it please the court,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Braham, rising impressively, \xe2\x80\x9cyour\r\nHonor has permitted the prosecution, and I have submitted without a\r\nword, to go into the most extraordinary testimony to establish a motive.\r\nAre we to be shut out from showing that the motive attributed to us\r\ncould not by reason of certain mental conditions exist? I purpose, may,\r\nit please your Honor, to show the cause and the origin of an aberration\r\nof mind, to follow it up, with other like evidence, connecting it with\r\nthe very moment of the homicide, showing a condition of the intellect,\r\nof the prisoner that precludes responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe State must insist upon its objections,\xe2\x80\x9d said the District Attorney.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe purpose evidently is to open the door to a mass of irrelevant\r\ntestimony, the object of which is to produce an effect upon the jury\r\nyour Honor well understands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested the judge, \xe2\x80\x9cthe court ought to hear the testimony,\r\nand exclude it afterwards, if it is irrelevant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill your honor hear argument on that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd argument his honor did hear, or pretend to, for two whole days,\r\nfrom all the counsel in turn, in the course of which the lawyers read\r\ncontradictory decisions enough to perfectly establish both sides, from\r\nvolume after volume, whole libraries in fact, until no mortal man could\r\nsay what the rules were. The question of insanity in all its legal\r\naspects was of course drawn into the discussion, and its application\r\naffirmed and denied. The case was felt to turn upon the admission or\r\nrejection of this evidence. It was a sort of test trial of strength\r\nbetween the lawyers. At the end the judge decided to admit the\r\ntestimony, as the judge usually does in such cases, after a sufficient\r\nwaste of time in what are called arguments.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hawkins was allowed to go on.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hawkins slowly and conscientiously, as if every detail of her\r\nfamily history was important, told the story of the steamboat explosion,\r\nof the finding and adoption of Laura. Silas, that is Mr. Hawkins, and\r\nshe always loved Laura, as if she had been their own child.\r\n\r\nShe then narrated the circumstances of Laura's supposed marriage, her\r\nabandonment and long illness, in a manner that touched all hearts. Laura\r\nhad been a different woman since then.\r\n\r\nCross-examined. At the time of first finding Laura on the steamboat, did\r\nshe notice that Laura's mind was at all deranged? She couldn't say that\r\nshe did. After the recovery of Laura from her long illness, did Mrs.\r\nHawkins think there were any signs of insanity about her? Witness\r\nconfessed that she did not think of it then.\r\n\r\nRe-Direct examination. \xe2\x80\x9cBut she was different after that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington Hawkins corroborated his mother's testimony as to Laura's\r\nconnection with Col. Selby. He was at Harding during the time of her\r\nliving there with him. After Col. Selby's desertion she was almost dead,\r\nnever appeared to know anything rightly for weeks. He added that he\r\nnever saw such a scoundrel as Selby. (Checked by District attorney.) Had\r\nhe noticed any change in Laura after her illness? Oh, yes. Whenever, any\r\nallusion was made that might recall Selby to mind, she looked awful--as\r\nif she could kill him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Braham, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there was an unnatural, insane gleam\r\nin her eyes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Washington in confusion.\r\n\r\nAll this was objected to by the district attorney, but it was got before\r\nthe jury, and Mr. Braham did not care how much it was ruled out after\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nBeriah Sellers was the next witness called. The Colonel made his way to\r\nthe stand with majestic, yet bland deliberation. Having taken the oath\r\nand kissed the Bible with a smack intended to show his great respect\r\nfor that book, he bowed to his Honor with dignity, to the jury with\r\nfamiliarity, and then turned to the lawyers and stood in an attitude of\r\nsuperior attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Sellers, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d began Mr. Braham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeriah Sellers, Missouri,\xe2\x80\x9d was the courteous acknowledgment that the\r\nlawyer was correct.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Sellers; you know the parties here, you are a friend of the\r\nfamily?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow them all, from infancy, sir. It was me, sir, that induced Silas\r\nHawkins, Judge Hawkins, to come to Missouri, and make his fortune. It\r\nwas by my advice and in company with me, sir, that he went into the\r\noperation of--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. Mr. Sellers, did you know a Major Lackland?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnew him, well, sir, knew him and honored him, sir. He was one of the\r\nmost remarkable men of our country, sir. A member of congress. He was\r\noften at my mansion sir, for weeks. He used to say to me, 'Col. Sellers,\r\nif you would go into politics, if I had you for a colleague, we should\r\nshow Calhoun and Webster that the brain of the country didn't lie east\r\nof the Alleganies. But I said--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. I believe Major Lackland is not living, Colonel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an almost imperceptible sense of pleasure betrayed in the\r\nColonel's face at this prompt acknowledgment of his title.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless you, no. Died years ago, a miserable death, sir, a ruined man, a\r\npoor sot. He was suspected of selling his vote in Congress, and probably\r\nhe did; the disgrace killed him, he was an outcast, sir, loathed by\r\nhimself and by his constituents. And I think, sir\xe2\x80\x9d----\r\n\r\nThe Judge. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will confine yourself, Col. Sellers to the questions of\r\nthe counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, your honor. This,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Colonel in confidential\r\nexplanation, \xe2\x80\x9cwas twenty years ago. I shouldn't have thought of\r\nreferring to such a trifling circumstance now. If I remember rightly,\r\nsir\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\nA bundle of letters was here handed to the witness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you recognize, that hand-writing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs if it was my own, sir. It's Major Lackland's. I was knowing to these\r\nletters when Judge Hawkins received them. [The Colonel's memory was a\r\nlittle at fault here. Mr. Hawkins had never gone into details with him\r\non this subject.] He used to show them to me, and say, 'Col, Sellers\r\nyou've a mind to untangle this sort of thing.' Lord, how everything\r\ncomes back to me. Laura was a little thing then. 'The Judge and I were\r\njust laying our plans to buy the Pilot Knob, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel, one moment. Your Honor, we put these letters in evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe letters were a portion of the correspondence of Major Lackland with\r\nSilas Hawkins; parts of them were missing and important letters were\r\nreferred to that were not here. They related, as the reader knows,\r\nto Laura's father. Lackland had come upon the track of a man who was\r\nsearching for a lost child in a Mississippi steamboat explosion years\r\nbefore. The man was lame in one leg, and appeared to be flitting from\r\nplace to place. It seemed that Major Lackland got so close track of him\r\nthat he was able to describe his personal appearance and learn his name.\r\nBut the letter containing these particulars was lost. Once he heard of\r\nhim at a hotel in Washington; but the man departed, leaving an empty\r\ntrunk, the day before the major went there. There was something very\r\nmysterious in all his movements.\r\n\r\nCol. Sellers, continuing his testimony, said that he saw this lost\r\nletter, but could not now recall the name. Search for the supposed\r\nfather had been continued by Lackland, Hawkins and himself for several\r\nyears, but Laura was not informed of it till after the death of Hawkins,\r\nfor fear of raising false hopes in her mind.\r\n\r\nHere the District Attorney arose and said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour Honor, I must positively object to letting the witness wander off\r\ninto all these irrelevant details.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Braham. \xe2\x80\x9cI submit your honor, that we cannot be interrupted in this\r\nmanner. We have suffered the state to have full swing. Now here is a\r\nwitness, who has known the prisoner from infancy, and is competent\r\nto testify upon the one point vital to her safety. Evidently he is a\r\ngentleman of character, and his knowledge of the case cannot be shut out\r\nwithout increasing the aspect of persecution which the State's attitude\r\ntowards the prisoner already has assumed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wrangle continued, waxing hotter and hotter. The Colonel seeing the\r\nattention of the counsel and Court entirely withdrawn from him, thought\r\nhe perceived here his opportunity, turning and beaming upon the jury,\r\nhe began simply to talk, but as the grandeur of his position grew upon\r\nhim--his talk broadened unconsciously into an oratorical vein.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see how she was situated, gentlemen; poor child, it might have\r\nbroken her heart to let her mind get to running on such a thing as that.\r\nYou see, from what we could make out her father was lame in the left leg\r\nand had a deep scar on his left forehead. And so ever since the day\r\nshe found out she had another father, she never could run across a lame\r\nstranger without being taken all over with a shiver, and almost fainting\r\nwhere she stood. And the next minute she would go right after that man.\r\nOnce she stumbled on a stranger with a game leg; and she was the most\r\ngrateful thing in this world--but it was the wrong leg, and it was days\r\nand days before she could leave her bed.\r\n\r\nOnce she found a man with a scar on his forehead and she was just going\r\nto throw herself into his arms, but he stepped out just then, and there\r\nwasn't anything the matter with his legs. Time and time again, gentlemen\r\nof the jury, has this poor suffering orphan flung herself on her knees\r\nwith all her heart's gratitude in her eyes before some scarred and\r\ncrippled veteran, but always, always to be disappointed, always to be\r\nplunged into new despair--if his legs were right his scar was wrong,\r\nif his scar was right his legs were wrong. Never could find a man that\r\nwould fill the bill. Gentlemen of the jury; you have hearts, you have\r\nfeelings, you have warm human sympathies; you can feel for this poor\r\nsuffering child. Gentlemen of the jury, if I had time, if I had the\r\nopportunity, if I might be permitted to go on and tell you the thousands\r\nand thousands and thousands of mutilated strangers this poor girl has\r\nstarted out of cover, and hunted from city to city, from state to state,\r\nfrom continent to continent, till she has run them down and found they\r\nwan't the ones; I know your hearts--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time the Colonel had become so warmed up, that his voice,\r\nhad reached a pitch above that of the contending counsel; the lawyers\r\nsuddenly stopped, and they and the Judge turned towards the Colonel and\r\nremained for several seconds too surprised at this novel exhibition to\r\nspeak. In this interval of silence, an appreciation of the situation\r\ngradually stole over the audience, and an explosion of laughter\r\nfollowed, in which even the Court and the bar could hardly keep from\r\njoining.\r\n\r\nSheriff. \xe2\x80\x9cOrder in the Court.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Judge. \xe2\x80\x9cThe witness will confine his remarks to answers to\r\nquestions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel turned courteously to the Judge and said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, your Honor--certainly. I am not well acquainted with the\r\nforms of procedure in the courts of New York, but in the West, sir, in\r\nthe West--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Judge. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, there, that will do, that will do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, your Honor, there were no questions asked me, and I thought\r\nI would take advantage of the lull in the proceedings to explain to the\r\njury a very significant train of--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Judge. \xe2\x80\x9cThat will DO sir! Proceed Mr. Braham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCol. Sellers, have you any reason to suppose that this man is still\r\nliving?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery reason, sir, every reason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cState why\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never heard of his death, sir. It has never come to my\r\nknowledge. In fact, sir, as I once said to Governor--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you state to the jury what has been the effect of the knowledge of\r\nthis wandering and evidently unsettled being, supposed to be her father,\r\nupon the mind of Miss Hawkins for so many years!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nQuestion objected to. Question ruled out.\r\n\r\nCross-examined. \xe2\x80\x9cMajor Sellers, what is your occupation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Colonel looked about him loftily, as if casting in his mind\r\nwhat would be the proper occupation of a person of such multifarious\r\ninterests and then said with dignity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA gentleman, sir. My father used to always say, sir\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCapt. Sellers, did you ever see this man, this supposed father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sir. But upon one occasion, old Senator Thompson said to me, its my\r\nopinion, Colonel Sellers\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever see any body who had seen him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir: It was reported around at one time, that\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe defense then spent a day in the examination of medical experts in\r\ninsanity who testified, on the evidence heard, that sufficient causes\r\nhad occurred to produce an insane mind in the prisoner. Numerous cases\r\nwere cited to sustain this opinion. There was such a thing as momentary\r\ninsanity, in which the person, otherwise rational to all appearances,\r\nwas for the time actually bereft of reason, and not responsible for his\r\nacts. The causes of this momentary possession could often be found in\r\nthe person's life. [It afterwards came out that the chief expert for the\r\ndefense, was paid a thousand dollars for looking into the case.]\r\n\r\nThe prosecution consumed another day in the examination of experts\r\nrefuting the notion of insanity. These causes might have produced\r\ninsanity, but there was no evidence that they have produced it in this\r\ncase, or that the prisoner was not at the time of the commission of the\r\ncrime in full possession of her ordinary faculties.\r\n\r\nThe trial had now lasted two weeks. It required four days now for the\r\nlawyers to \xe2\x80\x9csum up.\xe2\x80\x9d These arguments of the counsel were very important\r\nto their friends, and greatly enhanced their reputation at the bar\r\nbut they have small interest to us. Mr. Braham in his closing speech\r\nsurpassed himself; his effort is still remembered as the greatest in the\r\ncriminal annals of New York.\r\n\r\nMr. Braham re-drew for the jury the picture of Laura's early life; he\r\ndwelt long upon that painful episode of the pretended marriage and the\r\ndesertion. Col. Selby, he said, belonged, gentlemen; to what is called\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cupper classes.\xe2\x80\x9d It is the privilege of the \xe2\x80\x9cupper classes\xe2\x80\x9d to prey\r\nupon the sons and daughters of the people. The Hawkins family, though\r\nallied to the best blood of the South, were at the time in humble\r\ncircumstances. He commented upon her parentage. Perhaps her agonized\r\nfather, in his intervals of sanity, was still searching for his lost\r\ndaughter. Would he one day hear that she had died a felon's death?\r\nSociety had pursued her, fate had pursued her, and in a moment of\r\ndelirium she had turned and defied fate and society. He dwelt upon the\r\nadmission of base wrong in Col. Selby's dying statement. He drew a vivid\r\npicture of the villain at last overtaken by the vengeance of Heaven.\r\nWould the jury say that this retributive justice, inflicted by an\r\noutraged, and deluded woman, rendered irrational by the most cruel\r\nwrongs, was in the nature of a foul, premeditated murder? \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen;\r\nit is enough for me to look upon the life of this most beautiful and\r\naccomplished of her sex, blasted by the heartless villainy of man,\r\nwithout seeing, at the end of it; the horrible spectacle of a gibbet.\r\nGentlemen, we are all human, we have all sinned, we all have need of\r\nmercy. But I do not ask mercy of you who are the guardians of society\r\nand of the poor waifs, its sometimes wronged victims; I ask only that\r\njustice which you and I shall need in that last, dreadful hour, when\r\ndeath will be robbed of half its terrors if we can reflect that we have\r\nnever wronged a human being. Gentlemen, the life of this lovely and once\r\nhappy girl, this now stricken woman, is in your hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe jury were visibly affected. Half the court room was in tears. If a\r\nvote of both spectators and jury could have been taken then, the verdict\r\nwould have been, \xe2\x80\x9clet her go, she has suffered enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the district attorney had the closing argument. Calmly and without\r\nmalice or excitement he reviewed the testimony. As the cold facts were\r\nunrolled, fear settled upon the listeners. There was no escape from\r\nthe murder or its premeditation. Laura's character as a lobbyist in\r\nWashington which had been made to appear incidentally in the evidence\r\nwas also against her: the whole body of the testimony of the defense\r\nwas shown to be irrelevant, introduced only to excite sympathy, and not\r\ngiving a color of probability to the absurd supposition of insanity.\r\nThe attorney then dwelt upon the insecurity of life in the city, and the\r\ngrowing immunity with which women committed murders. Mr. McFlinn made a\r\nvery able speech; convincing the reason without touching the feelings.\r\n\r\nThe Judge in his charge reviewed the testimony with great show of\r\nimpartiality. He ended by saying that the verdict must be acquittal or\r\nmurder in the first degree. If you find that the prisoner committed\r\na homicide, in possession of her reason and with premeditation, your\r\nverdict will be accordingly. If you find she was not in her right mind,\r\nthat she was the victim of insanity, hereditary or momentary, as it has\r\nbeen explained, your verdict will take that into account.\r\n\r\nAs the Judge finished his charge, the spectators anxiously watched the\r\nfaces of the jury. It was not a remunerative study. In the court room\r\nthe general feeling was in favor of Laura, but whether this feeling\r\nextended to the jury, their stolid faces did not reveal. The public\r\noutside hoped for a conviction, as it always does; it wanted an example;\r\nthe newspapers trusted the jury would have the courage to do its duty.\r\nWhen Laura was convicted, then the public would turn around and abuse\r\nthe governor if he did not pardon her.\r\n\r\nThe jury went out. Mr. Braham preserved his serene confidence, but\r\nLaura's friends were dispirited. Washington and Col. Sellers had been\r\nobliged to go to Washington, and they had departed under the unspoken\r\nfear the verdict would be unfavorable, a disagreement was the best they\r\ncould hope for, and money was needed. The necessity of the passage of\r\nthe University bill was now imperative.\r\n\r\nThe Court waited for some time, but the jury gave no signs of coming in.\r\nMr. Braham said it was extraordinary. The Court then took a recess for\r\na couple of hours. Upon again coming in, word was brought that the jury\r\nhad not yet agreed.\r\n\r\nBut the jury had a question. The point upon which they wanted\r\ninstruction was this. They wanted to know if Col. Sellers was related to\r\nthe Hawkins family. The court then adjourned till morning.\r\n\r\nMr. Braham, who was in something of a pet, remarked to Mr. O'Toole that\r\nthey must have been deceived--that juryman with the broken nose could\r\nread!\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nThe momentous day was at hand--a day that promised to make or mar the\r\nfortunes of Hawkins family for all time. Washington Hawkins and Col.\r\nSellers were both up early, for neither of them could sleep. Congress\r\nwas expiring, and was passing bill after bill as if they were gasps and\r\neach likely to be its last. The University was on file for its third\r\nreading this day, and to-morrow Washington would be a millionaire and\r\nSellers no longer, impecunious but this day, also, or at farthest the\r\nnext, the jury in Laura's Case would come to a decision of some kind or\r\nother--they would find her guilty, Washington secretly feared, and then\r\nthe care and the trouble would all come back again, and these would be\r\nwearing months of besieging judges for new trials; on this day, also,\r\nthe re-election of Mr. Dilworthy to the Senate would take place. So\r\nWashington's mind was in a state of turmoil; there were more interests\r\nat stake than it could handle with serenity. He exulted when he thought\r\nof his millions; he was filled with dread when he thought of Laura. But\r\nSellers was excited and happy. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything is going right, everything's going perfectly right. Pretty\r\nsoon the telegrams will begin to rattle in, and then you'll see, my boy.\r\nLet the jury do what they please; what difference is it going to make?\r\nTo-morrow we can send a million to New York and set the lawyers at work\r\non the judges; bless your heart they will go before judge after judge\r\nand exhort and beseech and pray and shed tears. They always do; and they\r\nalways win, too. And they will win this time. They will get a writ of\r\nhabeas corpus, and a stay of proceedings, and a supersedeas, and a new\r\ntrial and a nolle prosequi, and there you are! That's the routine,\r\nand it's no trick at all to a New York lawyer. That's the regular\r\nroutine--everything's red tape and routine in the law, you see; it's\r\nall Greek to you, of course, but to a man who is acquainted with those\r\nthings it's mere--I'll explain it to you sometime. Everything's going\r\nto glide right along easy and comfortable now. You'll see, Washington,\r\nyou'll see how it will be. And then, let me think ..... Dilwortby will\r\nbe elected to-day, and by day, after to-morrow night he will be in New\r\nYork ready to put in his shovel--and you haven't lived in Washington all\r\nthis time not to know that the people who walk right by a Senator whose\r\nterm is up without hardly seeing him will be down at the deepo to say\r\n'Welcome back and God bless you; Senator, I'm glad to see you, sir!'\r\nwhen he comes along back re-elected, you know. Well, you see, his\r\ninfluence was naturally running low when he left here, but now he has\r\ngot a new six-years' start, and his suggestions will simply just weigh\r\na couple of tons a-piece day after tomorrow. Lord bless you he could\r\nrattle through that habeas corpus and supersedeas and all those things\r\nfor Laura all by himself if he wanted to, when he gets back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hadn't thought of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Washington, brightening, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is so.\r\nA newly-elected Senator is a power, I know that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes indeed he is.--Why it, is just human nature. Look at me. When we\r\nfirst came here, I was Mr. Sellers, and Major Sellers, Captain Sellers,\r\nbut nobody could ever get it right, somehow; but the minute our bill\r\nwent, through the House, I was Col. Sellers every time. And nobody could\r\ndo enough for me, and whatever I said was wonderful, Sir, it was always\r\nwonderful; I never seemed to say any flat things at all. It was Colonel,\r\nwon't you come and dine with us; and Colonel why don't we ever see you\r\nat our house; and the Colonel says this; and the Colonel says that; and\r\nwe know such-and-such is so-and-so because my husband heard Col. Sellers\r\nsay so. Don't you see? Well, the Senate adjourned and left our bill\r\nhigh, and dry, and I'll be hanged if I warn't Old Sellers from that\r\nday, till our bill passed the House again last week. Now I'm the Colonel\r\nagain; and if I were to eat all the dinners I am invited to, I reckon\r\nI'd wear my teeth down level with my gums in a couple of weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell I do wonder what you will be to-morrow; Colonel, after the\r\nPresident signs the bill!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeneral, sir?--General, without a doubt. Yes, sir, tomorrow it will\r\nbe General, let me congratulate you, sir; General, you've done a great\r\nwork, sir;--you've done a great work for the niggro; Gentlemen allow me\r\nthe honor to introduce my friend General Sellers, the humane friend\r\nof the niggro. Lord bless me; you'll' see the newspapers say, General\r\nSellers and servants arrived in the city last night and is stopping\r\nat the Fifth Avenue; and General Sellers has accepted a reception and\r\nbanquet by the Cosmopolitan Club; you'll see the General's opinions\r\nquoted, too--and what the General has to say about the propriety of a\r\nnew trial and a habeas corpus for the unfortunate Miss Hawkins will not\r\nbe without weight in influential quarters, I can tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I want to be the first to shake your faithful old hand and salute\r\nyou with your new honors, and I want to do it now--General!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nWashington, suiting the action to the word, and accompanying it with all\r\nthe meaning that a cordial grasp and eloquent eyes could give it.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel was touched; he was pleased and proud, too; his face\r\nanswered for that.\r\n\r\nNot very long after breakfast the telegrams began to arrive. The first\r\nwas from Braham, and ran thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe feel certain that the verdict will be rendered to-day. Be it good or\r\nbad, let it find us ready to make the next move instantly, whatever\r\nit may be.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat's the right talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sellers. \xe2\x80\x9cThat Braham's a\r\nwonderful man. He was the only man there that really understood me; he\r\ntold me so himself, afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe next telegram was from Mr. Dilworthy:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not only brought over the Great Invincible, but through him\r\na dozen more of the opposition. Shall be re-elected to-day by an\r\noverwhelming majority.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGood again!\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel. \xe2\x80\x9cThat man's\r\ntalent for organization is something marvelous. He wanted me to go out\r\nthere and engineer that thing, but I said, No, Dilworthy, I must be\r\non hand here,--both on Laura's account and the bill's--but you've no\r\ntrifling genius for organization yourself, said I--and I was right. You\r\ngo ahead, said I--you can fix it--and so he has. But I claim no credit\r\nfor that--if I stiffened up his back-bone a little, I simply put him in\r\nthe way to make his fight--didn't undertake it myself. He has captured\r\nNoble--. I consider that a splendid piece of diplomacy--Splendid, Sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy and by came another dispatch from New York:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJury still out. Laura calm and firm as a statue. The report that the\r\njury have brought her in guilty is false and premature.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPremature!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n gasped Washington, turning white. \xe2\x80\x9cThen they all expect that sort of a\r\nverdict, when it comes in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so did he; but he had not had courage enough to put it into\r\nwords. He had been preparing himself for the worst, but after all his\r\npreparation the bare suggestion of the possibility of such a verdict\r\nstruck him cold as death.\r\n\r\nThe friends grew impatient, now; the telegrams did not come fast enough:\r\neven the lightning could not keep up with their anxieties. They walked\r\nthe floor talking disjointedly and listening for the door-bell. Telegram\r\nafter telegram came. Still no result. By and by there was one which\r\ncontained a single line:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCourt now coming in after brief recess to hear verdict. Jury ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I wish they would finish!\xe2\x80\x9d said Washington. \xe2\x80\x9cThis suspense is\r\nkilling me by inches!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen came another telegram:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother hitch somewhere. Jury want a little more time and further\r\ninstructions.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, well, this is trying,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel. And\r\nafter a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cNo dispatch from Dilworthy for two hours, now. Even\r\na dispatch from him would be better than nothing, just to vary this\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey waited twenty minutes. It seemed twenty hours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said Washington. \xe2\x80\x9cI can't wait for the telegraph boy to come all\r\nthe way up here. Let's go down to Newspaper Row--meet him on the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile they were passing along the Avenue, they saw someone putting up a\r\ngreat display-sheet on the bulletin board of a newspaper office, and an\r\neager crowd of men was collecting abort the place. Washington and the\r\nColonel ran to the spot and read this:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTremendous Sensation! Startling news from Saint's Rest! On first ballot\r\nfor U. S. Senator, when voting was about to begin, Mr. Noble rose in\r\nhis place and drew forth a package, walked forward and laid it on the\r\nSpeaker's desk, saying, 'This contains $7,000 in bank bills and was\r\ngiven me by Senator Dilworthy in his bed-chamber at midnight last night\r\nto buy--my vote for him--I wish the Speaker to count the money and\r\nretain it to pay the expense of prosecuting this infamous traitor for\r\nbribery. The whole legislature was stricken speechless with dismay and\r\nastonishment. Noble further said that there were fifty members present\r\nwith money in their pockets, placed there by Dilworthy to buy their\r\nvotes. Amidst unparalleled excitement the ballot was now taken, and J.\r\nW. Smith elected U. S. Senator; Dilworthy receiving not one vote! Noble\r\npromises damaging exposures concerning Dilworthy and certain measures\r\nof his now pending in Congress. \xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens and earth!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the\r\nColonel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Capitol!\xe2\x80\x9d said Washington. \xe2\x80\x9cFly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they did fly. Long before they got there the newsboys were running\r\nahead of them with Extras, hot from the press, announcing the astounding\r\nnews.\r\n\r\nArrived in the gallery of the Senate, the friends saw a curious\r\nspectacle--every Senator held an Extra in his hand and looked as\r\ninterested as if it contained news of the destruction of the earth. Not\r\na single member was paying the least attention to the business of the\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary, in a loud voice, was just beginning to read the title of\r\na bill:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHouse-Bill--No. 4,231,--An-Act-to-Found-and-Incorporate-the\r\nKnobs-Industrial-University!\r\n--Read-first-and-second-time-considered-in-committee-of-the-whole-ordered-engrossed\r\nand-passed-to-third-reading-and-final passage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe President--\xe2\x80\x9cThird reading of the bill!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two friends shook in their shoes. Senators threw down their extras\r\nand snatched a word or two with each other in whispers. Then the gavel\r\nrapped to command silence while the names were called on the ayes and\r\nnays. Washington grew paler and paler, weaker and weaker while the\r\nlagging list progressed; and when it was finished, his head fell\r\nhelplessly forward on his arms. The fight was fought, the long struggle\r\nwas over, and he was a pauper. Not a man had voted for the bill!\r\n\r\nCol. Sellers was bewildered and well nigh paralyzed, himself. But no man\r\ncould long consider his own troubles in the presence of such suffering\r\nas Washington's. He got him up and supported him--almost carried him\r\nindeed--out of the building and into a carriage. All the way home\r\nWashington lay with his face against the Colonel's shoulder and merely\r\ngroaned and wept. The Colonel tried as well as he could under the dreary\r\ncircumstances to hearten him a little, but it was of no use. Washington\r\nwas past all hope of cheer, now. He only said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is all over--it is all over for good, Colonel. We must beg our\r\nbread, now. We never can get up again. It was our last chance, and it is\r\ngone. They will hang Laura! My God they will hang her! Nothing can\r\nsave the poor girl now. Oh, I wish with all my soul they would hang me\r\ninstead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArrived at home, Washington fell into a chair and buried his face in his\r\nhands and gave full way to his misery. The Colonel did not know where to\r\nturn nor what to do. The servant maid knocked at the door and passed in\r\na telegram, saying it had come while they were gone.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel tore it open and read with the voice of a man-of-war's\r\nbroadside:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVERDICT OF JURY, NOT GUILTY AND LAURA IS FREE!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nThe court room was packed on the morning on which the verdict of the\r\njury was expected, as it had been every day of the trial, and by\r\nthe same spectators, who had followed its progress with such intense\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThere is a delicious moment of excitement which the frequenter of\r\ntrials well knows, and which he would not miss for the world. It is that\r\ninstant when the foreman of the jury stands up to give the verdict, and\r\nbefore he has opened his fateful lips.\r\n\r\nThe court assembled and waited. It was an obstinate jury.\r\n\r\nIt even had another question--this intelligent jury--to ask the judge\r\nthis morning.\r\n\r\nThe question was this: \xe2\x80\x9cWere the doctors clear that the deceased had no\r\ndisease which might soon have carried him off, if he had not been shot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n There was evidently one jury man who didn't want to waste life, and was\r\nwilling to stake a general average, as the jury always does in a civil\r\ncase, deciding not according to the evidence but reaching the verdict by\r\nsome occult mental process.\r\n\r\nDuring the delay the spectators exhibited unexampled patience, finding\r\namusement and relief in the slightest movements of the court, the\r\nprisoner and the lawyers. Mr. Braham divided with Laura the attention of\r\nthe house. Bets were made by the Sheriff's deputies on the verdict, with\r\nlarge odds in favor of a disagreement.\r\n\r\nIt was afternoon when it was announced that the jury was coming in.\r\nThe reporters took their places and were all attention; the judge\r\nand lawyers were in their seats; the crowd swayed and pushed in eager\r\nexpectancy, as the jury walked in and stood up in silence.\r\n\r\nJudge. \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, have you agreed upon your verdict?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nForeman. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJudge. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nForeman. \xe2\x80\x9cNOT GUILTY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA shout went up from the entire room and a tumult of cheering which the\r\ncourt in vain attempted to quell. For a few moments all order was lost.\r\nThe spectators crowded within the bar and surrounded Laura who, calmer\r\nthan anyone else, was supporting her aged mother, who had almost fainted\r\nfrom excess of joy.\r\n\r\nAnd now occurred one of those beautiful incidents which no\r\nfiction-writer would dare to imagine, a scene of touching pathos,\r\ncreditable to our fallen humanity. In the eyes of the women of the\r\naudience Mr. Braham was the hero of the occasion; he had saved the life\r\nof the prisoner; and besides he was such a handsome man. The women could\r\nnot restrain their long pent-up emotions. They threw themselves upon Mr.\r\nBraham in a transport of gratitude; they kissed him again and again,\r\nthe young as well as the advanced in years, the married as well as\r\nthe ardent single women; they improved the opportunity with a touching\r\nself-sacrifice; in the words of a newspaper of the day they \xe2\x80\x9clavished\r\nhim with kisses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was something sweet to do; and it would be sweet for a woman to\r\nremember in after years, that she had kissed Braham! Mr. Braham himself\r\nreceived these fond assaults with the gallantry of his nation, enduring\r\nthe ugly, and heartily paying back beauty in its own coin.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful scene is still known in New York as \xe2\x80\x9cthe kissing of\r\nBraham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the tumult of congratulation had a little spent itself, and order\r\nwas restored, Judge O'Shaunnessy said that it now became his duty to\r\nprovide for the proper custody and treatment of the acquitted. The\r\nverdict of the jury having left no doubt that the woman was of an\r\nunsound mind, with a kind of insanity dangerous to the safety of the\r\ncommunity, she could not be permitted to go at large. \xe2\x80\x9cIn accordance\r\nwith the directions of the law in such cases,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Judge, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nin obedience to the dictates of a wise humanity, I hereby commit Laura\r\nHawkins to the care of the Superintendent of the State Hospital\r\nfor Insane Criminals, to be held in confinement until the State\r\nCommissioners on Insanity shall order her discharge. Mr. Sheriff, you\r\nwill attend at once to the execution of this decree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura was overwhelmed and terror-stricken. She had expected to walk\r\nforth in freedom in a few moments. The revulsion was terrible. Her\r\nmother appeared like one shaken with an ague fit. Laura insane! And\r\nabout to be locked up with madmen! She had never contemplated this. Mr.\r\nGraham said he should move at once for a writ of 'habeas corpus'.\r\n\r\nBut the judge could not do less than his duty, the law must have its\r\nway. As in the stupor of a sudden calamity, and not fully comprehending\r\nit, Mrs. Hawkins saw Laura led away by the officer.\r\n\r\nWith little space for thought she was rapidly driven to the railway\r\nstation, and conveyed to the Hospital for Lunatic Criminals. It was\r\nonly when she was within this vast and grim abode of madness that she\r\nrealized the horror of her situation. It was only when she was received\r\nby the kind physician and read pity in his eyes, and saw his look of\r\nhopeless incredulity when she attempted to tell him that she was not\r\ninsane; it was only when she passed through the ward to which she\r\nwas consigned and saw the horrible creatures, the victims of a double\r\ncalamity, whose dreadful faces she was hereafter to see daily, and was\r\nlocked into the small, bare room that was to be her home, that all her\r\nfortitude forsook her. She sank upon the bed, as soon as she was left\r\nalone--she had been searched by the matron--and tried to think. But her\r\nbrain was in a whirl. She recalled Braham's speech, she recalled the\r\ntestimony regarding her lunacy. She wondered if she were not mad; she\r\nfelt that she soon should be among these loathsome creatures. Better\r\nalmost to have died, than to slowly go mad in this confinement.\r\n\r\n--We beg the reader's pardon. This is not history, which has just been\r\nwritten. It is really what would have occurred if this were a novel.\r\nIf this were a work of fiction, we should not dare to dispose of Laura\r\notherwise. True art and any attention to dramatic proprieties required\r\nit. The novelist who would turn loose upon society an insane murderess\r\ncould not escape condemnation. Besides, the safety of society, the\r\ndecencies of criminal procedure, what we call our modern civilization,\r\nall would demand that Laura should be disposed of in the manner we\r\nhave described. Foreigners, who read this sad story, will be unable to\r\nunderstand any other termination of it.\r\n\r\nBut this is history and not fiction. There is no such law or custom as\r\nthat to which his Honor is supposed to have referred; Judge O'Shaunnessy\r\nwould not probably pay any attention to it if there were. There is no\r\nHospital for Insane Criminals; there is no State commission of lunacy.\r\nWhat actually occurred when the tumult in the court room had subsided\r\nthe sagacious reader will now learn.\r\n\r\nLaura left the court room, accompanied by her mother and other friends,\r\namid the congratulations of those assembled, and was cheered as she\r\nentered a carriage, and drove away. How sweet was the sunlight, how\r\nexhilarating the sense of freedom! Were not these following cheers the\r\nexpression of popular approval and affection? Was she not the heroine of\r\nthe hour?\r\n\r\nIt was with a feeling of triumph that Laura reached her hotel, a\r\nscornful feeling of victory over society with its own weapons.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hawkins shared not at all in this feeling; she was broken with the\r\ndisgrace and the long anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God, Laura,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cit is over. Now we will go away from this\r\nhateful city. Let us go home at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Laura, speaking with some tenderness, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot go\r\nwith you. There, don't cry, I cannot go back to that life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Hawkins was sobbing. This was more cruel than anything else, for\r\nshe had a dim notion of what it would be to leave Laura to herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, mother, you have been everything to me. You know how dearly I love\r\nyou. But I cannot go back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA boy brought in a telegraphic despatch. Laura took it and read:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bill is lost. Dilworthy ruined. (Signed) WASHINGTON.\xe2\x80\x9d For a moment\r\nthe words swam before her eyes. The next her eyes flashed fire as she\r\nhanded the dispatch to her mother and bitterly said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe world is against me. Well, let it be, let it. I am against it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a cruel disappointment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Hawkins, to whom one grief\r\nmore or less did not much matter now, \xe2\x80\x9cto you and, Washington; but we\r\nmust humbly bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBear it;\xe2\x80\x9d replied Laura scornfully, \xe2\x80\x9cI've all my life borne it, and\r\nfate has thwarted me at every step.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA servant came to the door to say that there was a gentleman below who\r\nwished to speak with Miss Hawkins. \xe2\x80\x9cJ. Adolphe Griller\xe2\x80\x9d was the name\r\nLaura read on the card. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know such a person. He probably comes\r\nfrom Washington. Send him up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Griller entered. He was a small man, slovenly in dress, his tone\r\nconfidential, his manner wholly void of animation, all his features\r\nbelow the forehead protruding--particularly the apple of his\r\nthroat--hair without a kink in it, a hand with no grip, a meek, hang-dog\r\ncountenance. He was a falsehood done in flesh and blood; for while every\r\nvisible sign about him proclaimed him a poor, witless, useless weakling,\r\nthe truth was that he had the brains to plan great enterprises and\r\nthe pluck to carry them through. That was his reputation, and it was a\r\ndeserved one. He softly said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI called to see you on business, Miss Hawkins. You have my card?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura bowed.\r\n\r\nMr. Griller continued to purr, as softly as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will proceed to business. I am a business man. I am a lecture-agent,\r\nMiss Hawkins, and as soon as I saw that you were acquitted, it occurred\r\nto me that an early interview would be mutually beneficial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't understand you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Laura coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo? You see, Miss Hawkins, this is your opportunity. If you will enter\r\nthe lecture field under good auspices, you will carry everything before\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, sir, I never lectured, I haven't any lecture, I don't know\r\nanything about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, madam, that makes no difference--no real difference. It is not\r\nnecessary to be able to lecture in order to go into the lecture tour.\r\nIf ones name is celebrated all over the land, especially, and, if she is\r\nalso beautiful, she is certain to draw large audiences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what should I lecture about?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Laura, beginning in spite of\r\nherself to be a little interested as well as amused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, why; woman--something about woman, I should say; the marriage\r\nrelation, woman's fate, anything of that sort. Call it The Revelations\r\nof a Woman's Life; now, there's a good title. I wouldn't want any better\r\ntitle than that. I'm prepared to make you an offer, Miss Hawkins, a\r\nliberal offer,--twelve thousand dollars for thirty nights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLaura thought. She hesitated. Why not? It would give her employment,\r\nmoney. She must do something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will think of it, and let you know soon. But still, there is very\r\nlittle likelihood that I--however, we will not discuss it further now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember, that the sooner we get to work the better, Miss Hawkins,\r\npublic curiosity is so fickle. Good day, madam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe close of the trial released Mr. Harry Brierly and left him free\r\nto depart upon his long talked of Pacific-coast mission. He was very\r\nmysterious about it, even to Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's confidential, old boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ca little scheme we have hatched\r\nup. I don't mind telling you that it's a good deal bigger thing than\r\nthat in Missouri, and a sure thing. I wouldn't take a half a million\r\njust for my share. And it will open something for you, Phil. You will\r\nhear from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip did hear from Harry a few months afterward. Everything promised\r\nsplendidly, but there was a little delay. Could Phil let him have a\r\nhundred, say, for ninety days?\r\n\r\nPhilip himself hastened to Philadelphia, and, as soon as the spring\r\nopened, to the mine at Ilium, and began transforming the loan he had\r\nreceived from Squire Montague into laborers' wages. He was haunted with\r\nmany anxieties; in the first place, Ruth was overtaxing her strength in\r\nher hospital labors, and Philip felt as if he must move heaven and\r\nearth to save her from such toil and suffering. His increased pecuniary\r\nobligation oppressed him. It seemed to him also that he had been one\r\ncause of the misfortune to the Bolton family, and that he was dragging\r\ninto loss and ruin everybody who associated with him. He worked on day\r\nafter day and week after week, with a feverish anxiety.\r\n\r\nIt would be wicked, thought Philip, and impious, to pray for luck; he\r\nfelt that perhaps he ought not to ask a blessing upon the sort of labor\r\nthat was only a venture; but yet in that daily petition, which this\r\nvery faulty and not very consistent young Christian gentleman put up, he\r\nprayed earnestly enough for Ruth and for the Boltons and for those\r\nwhom he loved and who trusted in him, and that his life might not be a\r\nmisfortune to them and a failure to himself.\r\n\r\nSince this young fellow went out into the world from his New England\r\nhome, he had done some things that he would rather his mother should not\r\nknow, things maybe that he would shrink from telling Ruth. At a certain\r\ngreen age young gentlemen are sometimes afraid of being called milksops,\r\nand Philip's associates had not always been the most select, such as\r\nthese historians would have chosen for him, or whom at a later, period\r\nhe would have chosen for himself. It seemed inexplicable, for instance,\r\nthat his life should have been thrown so much with his college\r\nacquaintance, Henry Brierly.\r\n\r\nYet, this was true of Philip, that in whatever company he had been he\r\nhad never been ashamed to stand up for the principles he learned from\r\nhis mother, and neither raillery nor looks of wonder turned him from\r\nthat daily habit he had learned at his mother's knees.--Even flippant\r\nHarry respected this, and perhaps it was one of the reasons why Harry\r\nand all who knew Philip trusted him implicitly. And yet it must be\r\nconfessed that Philip did not convey the impression to the world of a\r\nvery serious young man, or of a man who might not rather easily fall\r\ninto temptation. One looking for a real hero would have to go elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe parting between Laura and her mother was exceedingly painful to\r\nboth. It was as if two friends parted on a wide plain, the one to\r\njourney towards the setting and the other towards the rising sun, each\r\ncomprehending that every step henceforth must separate their lives,\r\nwider and wider.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Noble's bombshell fell in Senator Dilworthy's camp, the\r\nstatesman was disconcerted for a moment. For a moment; that was all. The\r\nnext moment he was calmly up and doing. From the centre of our country\r\nto its circumference, nothing was talked of but Mr. Noble's terrible\r\nrevelation, and the people were furious. Mind, they were not furious\r\nbecause bribery was uncommon in our public life, but merely because here\r\nwas another case. Perhaps it did not occur to the nation of good and\r\nworthy people that while they continued to sit comfortably at home and\r\nleave the true source of our political power (the \xe2\x80\x9cprimaries,\xe2\x80\x9d) in the\r\nhands of saloon-keepers, dog-fanciers and hod-carriers, they could go on\r\nexpecting \xe2\x80\x9canother\xe2\x80\x9d case of this kind, and even dozens and hundreds of\r\nthem, and never be disappointed. However, they may have thought that to\r\nsit at home and grumble would some day right the evil.\r\n\r\nYes, the nation was excited, but Senator Dilworthy was calm--what was\r\nleft of him after the explosion of the shell. Calm, and up and doing.\r\nWhat did he do first? What would you do first, after you had tomahawked\r\nyour mother at the breakfast table for putting too much sugar in your\r\ncoffee? You would \xe2\x80\x9cask for a suspension of public opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d That is\r\nwhat Senator Dilworthy did. It is the custom. He got the usual amount of\r\nsuspension. Far and wide he was called a thief, a briber, a promoter of\r\nsteamship subsidies, railway swindles, robberies of the government in\r\nall possible forms and fashions. Newspapers and everybody else called\r\nhim a pious hypocrite, a sleek, oily fraud, a reptile who manipulated\r\ntemperance movements, prayer meetings, Sunday schools, public charities,\r\nmissionary enterprises, all for his private benefit. And as these\r\ncharges were backed up by what seemed to be good and sufficient,\r\nevidence, they were believed with national unanimity.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Dilworthy made another move. He moved instantly to Washington\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cdemanded an investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d Even this could not pass without\r\ncomment. Many papers used language to this effect:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSenator Dilworthy's remains have demanded an investigation. This sounds\r\nfine and bold and innocent; but when we reflect that they demand it at\r\nthe hands of the Senate of the United States, it simply becomes matter\r\nfor derision. One might as well set the gentlemen detained in the public\r\nprisons to trying each other. This investigation is likely to be like\r\nall other Senatorial investigations--amusing but not useful. Query. Why\r\ndoes the Senate still stick to this pompous word, 'Investigation?' One\r\ndoes not blindfold one's self in order to investigate an object.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nDilworthy appeared in his place in the Senate and offered a resolution\r\nappointing a committee to investigate his case. It carried, of course,\r\nand the committee was appointed. Straightway the newspapers said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder the guise of appointing a committee to investigate the late Mr.\r\nDilworthy, the Senate yesterday appointed a committee to investigate\r\nhis accuser, Mr. Noble. This is the exact spirit and meaning of the\r\nresolution, and the committee cannot try anybody but Mr. Noble without\r\noverstepping its authority. That Dilworthy had the effrontery to offer\r\nsuch a resolution will surprise no one, and that the Senate could\r\nentertain it without blushing and pass it without shame will surprise\r\nno one. We are now reminded of a note which we have received from the\r\nnotorious burglar Murphy, in which he finds fault with a statement of\r\nours to the effect that he had served one term in the penitentiary and\r\nalso one in the U. S. Senate. He says, 'The latter statement is untrue\r\nand does me great injustice.' After an unconscious sarcasm like that,\r\nfurther comment is unnecessary.\xe2\x80\x9d And yet the Senate was roused by the\r\nDilworthy trouble. Many speeches were made. One Senator (who was accused\r\nin the public prints of selling his chances of re-election to his\r\nopponent for $50,000 and had not yet denied the charge) said that, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\npresence in the Capital of such a creature as this man Noble, to testify\r\nagainst a brother member of their body, was an insult to the Senate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother Senator said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet the investigation go on and let it make an\r\nexample of this man Noble; let it teach him and men like him that\r\nthey could not attack the reputation of a United States Senator with\r\nimpunity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother said he was glad the investigation was to be had, for it was\r\nhigh time that the Senate should crush some cur like this man Noble, and\r\nthus show his kind that it was able and resolved to uphold its ancient\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\nA by-stander laughed, at this finely delivered peroration; and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this is the Senator who franked his baggage home through the mails\r\nlast week--registered, at that. However, perhaps he was merely engaged\r\nin 'upholding the ancient dignity of the Senate,'--then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, the modern dignity of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said another by-stander. \xe2\x80\x9cIt don't\r\nresemble its ancient dignity but it fits its modern style like a glove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere being no law against making offensive remarks about U. S.\r\nSenators, this conversation, and others like it, continued without let\r\nor hindrance. But our business is with the investigating committee.\r\n\r\nMr. Noble appeared before the Committee of the Senate; and testified to\r\nthe following effect:\r\n\r\nHe said that he was a member of the State legislature of the\r\nHappy-Land-of-Canaan; that on the --- day of ------ he assembled himself\r\ntogether at the city of Saint's Rest, the capital of the State, along\r\nwith his brother legislators; that he was known to be a political enemy\r\nof Mr. Dilworthy and bitterly opposed to his re-election; that Mr.\r\nDilworthy came to Saint's Rest and reported to be buying pledges of\r\nvotes with money; that the said Dilworthy sent for him to come to\r\nhis room in the hotel at night, and he went; was introduced to\r\nMr. Dilworthy; called two or three times afterward at Dilworthy's\r\nrequest--usually after midnight; Mr. Dilworthy urged him to vote for\r\nhim; Noble declined; Dilworthy argued; said he was bound to be elected,\r\nand could then ruin him (Noble) if he voted no; said he had every\r\nrailway and every public office and stronghold of political power in the\r\nState under his thumb, and could set up or pull down any man he chose;\r\ngave instances showing where and how he had used this power; if Noble\r\nwould vote for him he would make him a Representative in Congress; Noble\r\nstill declined to vote, and said he did not believe Dilworthy was going\r\nto be elected; Dilworthy showed a list of men who would vote for him--a\r\nmajority of the legislature; gave further proofs of his power by telling\r\nNoble everything the opposing party had done or said in secret caucus;\r\nclaimed that his spies reported everything to him, and that--\r\n\r\nHere a member of the Committee objected that this evidence was\r\nirrelevant and also in opposition to the spirit of the Committee's\r\ninstructions, because if these things reflected upon any one it was\r\nupon Mr. Dilworthy. The chairman said, let the person proceed with his\r\nstatement--the Committee could exclude evidence that did not bear upon\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nMr. Noble continued. He said that his party would cast him out if he\r\nvoted for Mr. Dilworthy; Dilworthy said that that would inure to\r\nhis benefit because he would then be a recognized friend of his\r\n(Dilworthy's) and he could consistently exalt him politically and make\r\nhis fortune; Noble said he was poor, and it was hard to tempt him so;\r\nDilworthy said he would fix that; he said, \xe2\x80\x9cTell, me what you want, and\r\nsay you will vote for me;\xe2\x80\x9d Noble could not say; Dilworthy said \xe2\x80\x9cI will\r\ngive you $5,000.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA Committee man said, impatiently, that this stuff was all outside\r\nthe case, and valuable time was being wasted; this was all a plain\r\nreflection upon a brother Senator. The Chairman said it was the quickest\r\nway to proceed, and the evidence need have no weight.\r\n\r\nMr. Noble continued. He said he told Dilworthy that $5,000 was not\r\nmuch to pay for a man's honor, character and everything that was\r\nworth having; Dilworthy said he was surprised; he considered $5,000\r\na fortune--for some men; asked what Noble's figure was; Noble said he\r\ncould not think $10,000 too little; Dilworthy said it was a great deal\r\ntoo much; he would not do it for any other man, but he had conceived\r\na liking for Noble, and where he liked a man his heart yearned to help\r\nhim; he was aware that Noble was poor, and had a family to support, and\r\nthat he bore an unblemished reputation at home; for such a man and such\r\na man's influence he could do much, and feel that to help such a man\r\nwould be an act that would have its reward; the struggles of the poor\r\nalways touched him; he believed that Noble would make a good use of this\r\nmoney and that it would cheer many a sad heart and needy home; he would\r\ngive the $10,000; all he desired in return was that when the balloting\r\nbegan, Noble should cast his vote for him and should explain to the\r\nlegislature that upon looking into the charges against Mr. Dilworthy of\r\nbribery, corruption, and forwarding stealing measures in Congress he had\r\nfound them to be base calumnies upon a man whose motives were pure and\r\nwhose character was stainless; he then took from his pocket $2,000 in\r\nbank bills and handed them to Noble, and got another package containing\r\n$5,000 out of his trunk and gave to him also. He----\r\n\r\nA Committee man jumped up, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last, Mr. Chairman, this shameless person has arrived at the point.\r\nThis is sufficient and conclusive. By his own confession he has received\r\na bribe, and did it deliberately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a grave offense, and cannot be passed over in silence, sir. By\r\nthe terms of our instructions we can now proceed to mete out to him such\r\npunishment as is meet for one who has maliciously brought disrespect\r\nupon a Senator of the United States. We have no need to hear the rest of\r\nhis evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Chairman said it would be better and more regular to proceed with\r\nthe investigation according to the usual forms. A note would be made of\r\nMr. Noble's admission.\r\n\r\nMr. Noble continued. He said that it was now far past midnight; that\r\nhe took his leave and went straight to certain legislators, told\r\nthem everything, made them count the money, and also told them of the\r\nexposure he would make in joint convention; he made that exposure, as\r\nall the world knew. The rest of the $10,000 was to be paid the day after\r\nDilworthy was elected.\r\n\r\nSenator Dilworthy was now asked to take the stand and tell what he knew\r\nabout the man Noble. The Senator wiped his mouth with his handkerchief,\r\nadjusted his white cravat, and said that but for the fact that public\r\nmorality required an example, for the warning of future Nobles, he would\r\nbeg that in Christian charity this poor misguided creature might be\r\nforgiven and set free. He said that it was but too evident that this\r\nperson had approached him in the hope of obtaining a bribe; he had\r\nintruded himself time and again, and always with moving stories of his\r\npoverty. Mr. Dilworthy said that his heart had bled for him--insomuch\r\nthat he had several times been on the point of trying to get some one to\r\ndo something for him. Some instinct had told him from the beginning that\r\nthis was a bad man, an evil-minded man, but his inexperience of such had\r\nblinded him to his real motives, and hence he had never dreamed that\r\nhis object was to undermine the purity of a United States Senator. He\r\nregretted that it was plain, now, that such was the man's object and\r\nthat punishment could not with safety to the Senate's honor be withheld.\r\nHe grieved to say that one of those mysterious dispensations of an\r\ninscrutable Providence which are decreed from time to time by His wisdom\r\nand for His righteous, purposes, had given this conspirator's tale a\r\ncolor of plausibility,--but this would soon disappear under the clear\r\nlight of truth which would now be thrown upon the case.\r\n\r\nIt so happened, (said the Senator,) that about the time in question, a\r\npoor young friend of mine, living in a distant town of my State, wished\r\nto establish a bank; he asked me to lend him the necessary money; I said\r\nI had no, money just then, but world try to borrow it. The day before\r\nthe election a friend said to me that my election expenses must be\r\nvery large specially my hotel bills, and offered to lend me some money.\r\nRemembering my young, friend, I said I would like a few thousands now,\r\nand a few more by and by; whereupon he gave me two packages of bills\r\nsaid to contain $2,000 and $5,000 respectively; I did not open the\r\npackages or count the money; I did not give any note or receipt for\r\nthe same; I made no memorandum of the transaction, and neither did my\r\nfriend. That night this evil man Noble came troubling me again: I could\r\nnot rid myself of him, though my time was very precious. He mentioned my\r\nyoung friend and said he was very anxious to have the $7000 now to begin\r\nhis banking operations with, and could wait a while for the rest. Noble\r\nwished to get the money and take it to him. I finally gave him the\r\ntwo packages of bills; I took no note or receipt from him, and made no\r\nmemorandum of the matter. I no more look for duplicity and deception in\r\nanother man than I would look for it in myself. I never thought of\r\nthis man again until I was overwhelmed the next day by learning what a\r\nshameful use he had made of the confidence I had reposed in him and\r\nthe money I had entrusted to his care. This is all, gentlemen. To the\r\nabsolute truth of every detail of my statement I solemnly swear, and I\r\ncall Him to witness who is the Truth and the loving Father of all whose\r\nlips abhor false speaking; I pledge my honor as a Senator, that I have\r\nspoken but the truth. May God forgive this wicked man as I do.\r\n\r\nMr. Noble--\xe2\x80\x9cSenator Dilworthy, your bank account shows that up to\r\nthat day, and even on that very day, you conducted all your financial\r\nbusiness through the medium of checks instead of bills, and so kept\r\ncareful record of every moneyed transaction. Why did you deal in bank\r\nbills on this particular occasion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Chairman--\xe2\x80\x9cThe gentleman will please to remember that the Committee\r\nis conducting this investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Noble--\xe2\x80\x9cThen will the Committee ask the question?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Chairman--\xe2\x80\x9cThe Committee will--when it desires to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Noble--\xe2\x80\x9cWhich will not be during this century perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Chairman--\xe2\x80\x9cAnother remark like that, sir, will procure you the\r\nattentions of the Sergeant-at-arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Noble--\xe2\x80\x9cD--n the Sergeant-at-arms, and the Committee too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSeveral Committeemen--\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Chairman, this is Contempt!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Noble--\xe2\x80\x9cContempt of whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the Committee! Of the Senate of the United States!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Noble--\xe2\x80\x9cThen I am become the acknowledged representative of a\r\nnation. You know as well as I do that the whole nation hold as much\r\nas three-fifths of the United States Senate in entire\r\ncontempt.--Three-fifths of you are Dilworthys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant-at-arms very soon put a quietus upon the observations of\r\nthe representative of the nation, and convinced him that he was not in\r\nthe over-free atmosphere of his Happy-Land-of-Canaan:\r\n\r\nThe statement of Senator Dilworthy naturally carried conviction to the\r\nminds of the committee.--It was close, logical, unanswerable; it bore\r\nmany internal evidences of its truth. For instance, it is customary in\r\nall countries for business men to loan large sums of money in bank bills\r\ninstead of checks. It is customary for the lender to make no memorandum\r\nof the transaction. It is customary, for the borrower to receive the\r\nmoney without making a memorandum of it, or giving a note or a receipt\r\nfor it's use--the borrower is not likely to die or forget about it.\r\nIt is customary to lend nearly anybody money to start a bank with\r\nespecially if you have not the money to lend him and have to borrow it\r\nfor the purpose. It is customary to carry large sums of money in bank\r\nbills about your person or in your trunk. It is customary to hand a\r\nlarge sum in bank bills to a man you have just been introduced to (if\r\nhe asks you to do it,) to be conveyed to a distant town and delivered\r\nto another party. It is not customary to make a memorandum of this\r\ntransaction; it is not customary for the conveyor to give a note or a\r\nreceipt for the money; it is not customary to require that he shall get\r\na note or a receipt from the man he is to convey it to in the distant\r\ntown. It would be at least singular in you to say to the proposed\r\nconveyor, \xe2\x80\x9cYou might be robbed; I will deposit the money in a bank and\r\nsend a check for it to my friend through the mail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVery well. It being plain that Senator Dilworthy's statement was rigidly\r\ntrue, and this fact being strengthened by his adding to it the support\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9chis honor as a Senator,\xe2\x80\x9d the Committee rendered a verdict of \xe2\x80\x9cNot\r\nproven that a bribe had been offered and accepted.\xe2\x80\x9d This in a manner\r\nexonerated Noble and let him escape.\r\n\r\nThe Committee made its report to the Senate, and that body proceeded to\r\nconsider its acceptance. One Senator indeed, several Senators--objected\r\nthat the Committee had failed of its duty; they had proved this man\r\nNoble guilty of nothing, they had meted out no punishment to him; if the\r\nreport were accepted, he would go forth free and scathless, glorying in\r\nhis crime, and it would be a tacit admission that any blackguard could\r\ninsult the Senate of the United States and conspire against the sacred\r\nreputation of its members with impunity; the Senate owed it to the\r\nupholding of its ancient dignity to make an example of this man\r\nNoble--he should be crushed.\r\n\r\nAn elderly Senator got up and took another view of the case. This was\r\na Senator of the worn-out and obsolete pattern; a man still lingering\r\namong the cobwebs of the past, and behind the spirit of the age. He\r\nsaid that there seemed to be a curious misunderstanding of the case.\r\nGentlemen seemed exceedingly anxious to preserve and maintain the honor\r\nand dignity of the Senate.\r\n\r\nWas this to be done by trying an obscure adventurer for attempting to\r\ntrap a Senator into bribing him? Or would not the truer way be to find\r\nout whether the Senator was capable of being entrapped into so shameless\r\nan act, and then try him? Why, of course. Now the whole idea of the\r\nSenate seemed to be to shield the Senator and turn inquiry away from\r\nhim. The true way to uphold the honor of the Senate was to have none but\r\nhonorable men in its body. If this Senator had yielded to temptation\r\nand had offered a bribe, he was a soiled man and ought to be instantly\r\nexpelled; therefore he wanted the Senator tried, and not in the usual\r\nnamby-pamby way, but in good earnest. He wanted to know the truth\r\nof this matter. For himself, he believed that the guilt of Senator\r\nDilworthy was established beyond the shadow of a doubt; and he\r\nconsidered that in trifling with his case and shirking it the Senate was\r\ndoing a shameful and cowardly thing--a thing which suggested that in\r\nits willingness to sit longer in the company of such a man, it was\r\nacknowledging that it was itself of a kind with him and was therefore\r\nnot dishonored by his presence. He desired that a rigid examination be\r\nmade into Senator Dilworthy's case, and that it be continued clear into\r\nthe approaching extra session if need be. There was no dodging this\r\nthing with the lame excuse of want of time.\r\n\r\nIn reply, an honorable Senator said that he thought it would be as well\r\nto drop the matter and accept the Committee's report. He said with some\r\njocularity that the more one agitated this thing, the worse it was for\r\nthe agitator. He was not able to deny that he believed Senator Dilworthy\r\nto be guilty--but what then? Was it such an extraordinary case? For\r\nhis part, even allowing the Senator to be guilty, he did not think his\r\ncontinued presence during the few remaining days of the Session would\r\ncontaminate the Senate to a dreadful degree. [This humorous sally was\r\nreceived with smiling admiration--notwithstanding it was not wholly new,\r\nhaving originated with the Massachusetts General in the House a day or\r\ntwo before, upon the occasion of the proposed expulsion of a member for\r\nselling his vote for money.]\r\n\r\nThe Senate recognized the fact that it could not be contaminated by\r\nsitting a few days longer with Senator Dilworthy, and so it accepted the\r\ncommittee's report and dropped the unimportant matter.\r\n\r\nMr. Dilworthy occupied his seat to the last hour of the session. He said\r\nthat his people had reposed a trust in him, and it was not for him to\r\ndesert them. He would remain at his post till he perished, if need be.\r\n\r\nHis voice was lifted up and his vote cast for the last time, in support\r\nof an ingenious measure contrived by the General from Massachusetts\r\nwhereby the President's salary was proposed to be doubled and every\r\nCongressman paid several thousand dollars extra for work previously\r\ndone, under an accepted contract, and already paid for once and\r\nreceipted for.\r\n\r\nSenator Dilworthy was offered a grand ovation by his friends at home,\r\nwho said that their affection for him and their confidence in him were\r\nin no wise impaired by the persecutions that had pursued him, and that\r\nhe was still good enough for them.\r\n\r\n[The $7,000 left by Mr. Noble with his state legislature was placed\r\nin safe keeping to await the claim of the legitimate owner. Senator\r\nDilworthy made one little effort through his protege the embryo banker\r\nto recover it, but there being no notes of hand or, other memoranda to\r\nsupport the claim, it failed. The moral of which is, that when one\r\nloans money to start a bank with, one ought to take the party's written\r\nacknowledgment of the fact.]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nFor some days Laura had been a free woman once more. During this time,\r\nshe had experienced--first, two or three days of triumph, excitement,\r\ncongratulations, a sort of sunburst of gladness, after a long night of\r\ngloom and anxiety; then two or three days of calming down, by degrees--a\r\nreceding of tides, a quieting of the storm-wash to a murmurous\r\nsurf-beat, a diminishing of devastating winds to a refrain that bore the\r\nspirit of a truce-days given to solitude, rest, self-communion, and\r\nthe reasoning of herself into a realization of the fact that she was\r\nactually done with bolts and bars, prison horrors and impending death;\r\nthen came a day whose hours filed slowly by her, each laden with some\r\nremnant, some remaining fragment of the dreadful time so lately ended--a\r\nday which, closing at last, left the past a fading shore behind her and\r\nturned her eyes toward the broad sea of the future. So speedily do we\r\nput the dead away and come back to our place in the ranks to march in\r\nthe pilgrimage of life again.\r\n\r\nAnd now the sun rose once more and ushered in the first day of what\r\nLaura comprehended and accepted as a new life.\r\n\r\nThe past had sunk below the horizon, and existed no more for her; she\r\nwas done with it for all time. She was gazing out over the trackless\r\nexpanses of the future, now, with troubled eyes. Life must be begun\r\nagain--at eight and twenty years of age. And where to begin? The page\r\nwas blank, and waiting for its first record; so this was indeed a\r\nmomentous day.\r\n\r\nHer thoughts drifted back, stage by stage, over her career. As far as\r\nthe long highway receded over the plain of her life, it was lined with\r\nthe gilded and pillared splendors of her ambition all crumbled to ruin\r\nand ivy-grown; every milestone marked a disaster; there was no green\r\nspot remaining anywhere in memory of a hope that had found its fruition;\r\nthe unresponsive earth had uttered no voice of flowers in testimony that\r\none who was blest had gone that road.\r\n\r\nHer life had been a failure. That was plain, she said. No more of that.\r\nShe would now look the future in the face; she would mark her course\r\nupon the chart of life, and follow it; follow it without swerving,\r\nthrough rocks and shoals, through storm and calm, to a haven of rest\r\nand peace or shipwreck. Let the end be what it might, she would mark her\r\ncourse now--to-day--and follow it.\r\n\r\nOn her table lay six or seven notes. They were from lovers; from some\r\nof the prominent names in the land; men whose devotion had survived\r\neven the grisly revealments of her character which the courts had\r\nuncurtained; men who knew her now, just as she was, and yet pleaded as\r\nfor their lives for the dear privilege of calling the murderess wife.\r\n\r\nAs she read these passionate, these worshiping, these supplicating\r\nmissives, the woman in her nature confessed itself; a strong yearning\r\ncame upon her to lay her head upon a loyal breast and find rest from\r\nthe conflict of life, solace for her griefs, the healing of love for her\r\nbruised heart.\r\n\r\nWith her forehead resting upon her hand, she sat thinking, thinking,\r\nwhile the unheeded moments winged their flight. It was one of those\r\nmornings in early spring when nature seems just stirring to a half\r\nconsciousness out of a long, exhausting lethargy; when the first faint\r\nbalmy airs go wandering about, whispering the secret of the coming\r\nchange; when the abused brown grass, newly relieved of snow, seems\r\nconsidering whether it can be worth the trouble and worry of contriving\r\nits green raiment again only to fight the inevitable fight with the\r\nimplacable winter and be vanquished and buried once more; when the sun\r\nshines out and a few birds venture forth and lift up a forgotten song;\r\nwhen a strange stillness and suspense pervades the waiting air. It is a\r\ntime when one's spirit is subdued and sad, one knows not why; when the\r\npast seems a storm-swept desolation, life a vanity and a burden, and the\r\nfuture but a way to death. It is a time when one is filled with vague\r\nlongings; when one dreams of flight to peaceful islands in the remote\r\nsolitudes of the sea, or folds his hands and says, What is the use of\r\nstruggling, and toiling and worrying any more? let us give it all up.\r\n\r\nIt was into such a mood as this that Laura had drifted from the musings\r\nwhich the letters of her lovers had called up. Now she lifted her head\r\nand noted with surprise how the day had wasted. She thrust the letters\r\naside, rose up and went and stood at the window. But she was soon\r\nthinking again, and was only gazing into vacancy.\r\n\r\nBy and by she turned; her countenance had cleared; the dreamy look was\r\ngone out of her face, all indecision had vanished; the poise of her head\r\nand the firm set of her lips told that her resolution was formed. She\r\nmoved toward the table with all the old dignity in her carriage, and all\r\nthe old pride in her mien. She took up each letter in its turn, touched\r\na match to it and watched it slowly consume to ashes. Then she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have landed upon a foreign shore, and burned my ships behind me.\r\nThese letters were the last thing that held me in sympathy with any\r\nremnant or belonging of the old life. Henceforth that life and all that\r\nappertains to it are as dead to me and as far removed from me as if I\r\nwere become a denizen of another world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said that love was not for her--the time that it could have\r\nsatisfied her heart was gone by and could not return; the opportunity\r\nwas lost, nothing could restore it. She said there could be no love\r\nwithout respect, and she would only despise a man who could content\r\nhimself with a thing like her. Love, she said, was a woman's first\r\nnecessity: love being forfeited; there was but one thing left that could\r\ngive a passing zest to a wasted life, and that was fame, admiration, the\r\napplause of the multitude.\r\n\r\nAnd so her resolution was taken. She would turn to that final resort\r\nof the disappointed of her sex, the lecture platform. She would array\r\nherself in fine attire, she would adorn herself with jewels, and stand\r\nin her isolated magnificence before massed audiences and enchant them\r\nwith her eloquence and amaze them with her unapproachable beauty. She\r\nwould move from city to city like a queen of romance, leaving marveling\r\nmultitudes behind her and impatient multitudes awaiting her coming.\r\nHer life, during one hour of each day, upon the platform, would be a\r\nrapturous intoxication--and when the curtain fell and the lights were\r\nout, and the people gone, to nestle in their homes and forget her, she\r\nwould find in sleep oblivion of her homelessness, if she could, if not\r\nshe would brave out the night in solitude and wait for the next day's\r\nhour of ecstasy.\r\n\r\nSo, to take up life and begin again was no great evil. She saw her way.\r\nShe would be brave and strong; she would make the best of what was left\r\nfor her among the possibilities.\r\n\r\nShe sent for the lecture agent, and matters were soon arranged.\r\n\r\nStraightway, all the papers were filled with her name, and all the dead\r\nwalls flamed with it. The papers called down imprecations upon her head;\r\nthey reviled her without stint; they wondered if all sense of decency\r\nwas dead in this shameless murderess, this brazen lobbyist, this\r\nheartless seducer of the affections of weak and misguided men; they\r\nimplored the people, for the sake of their pure wives, their sinless\r\ndaughters, for the sake of decency, for the sake of public morals, to\r\ngive this wretched creature such a rebuke as should be an all-sufficient\r\nevidence to her and to such as her, that there was a limit where the\r\nflaunting of their foul acts and opinions before the world must stop;\r\ncertain of them, with a higher art, and to her a finer cruelty, a\r\nsharper torture, uttered no abuse, but always spoke of her in terms of\r\nmocking eulogy and ironical admiration. Everybody talked about the new\r\nwonder, canvassed the theme of her proposed discourse, and marveled how\r\nshe would handle it.\r\n\r\nLaura's few friends wrote to her or came and talked with her, and\r\npleaded with her to retire while it was yet time, and not attempt to\r\nface the gathering storm. But it was fruitless. She was stung to the\r\nquick by the comments of the newspapers; her spirit was roused, her\r\nambition was towering, now. She was more determined than ever. She would\r\nshow these people what a hunted and persecuted woman could do.\r\n\r\nThe eventful night came. Laura arrived before the great lecture hall in\r\na close carriage within five minutes of the time set for the lecture to\r\nbegin. When she stepped out of the vehicle her heart beat fast and her\r\neyes flashed with exultation: the whole street was packed with people,\r\nand she could hardly force her way to the hall! She reached the\r\nante-room, threw off her wraps and placed herself before the\r\ndressing-glass. She turned herself this way and that--everything was\r\nsatisfactory, her attire was perfect. She smoothed her hair, rearranged\r\na jewel here and there, and all the while her heart sang within her, and\r\nher face was radiant. She had not been so happy for ages and ages, it\r\nseemed to her. Oh, no, she had never been so overwhelmingly grateful and\r\nhappy in her whole life before. The lecture agent appeared at the door.\r\nShe waved him away and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not disturb me. I want no introduction. And do not fear for me; the\r\nmoment the hands point to eight I will step upon the platform.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe disappeared. She held her watch before her. She was so impatient that\r\nthe second-hand seemed whole tedious minutes dragging its way around\r\nthe circle. At last the supreme moment came, and with head erect and\r\nthe bearing of an empress she swept through the door and stood upon the\r\nstage. Her eyes fell upon only a vast, brilliant emptiness--there were\r\nnot forty people in the house! There were only a handful of coarse men\r\nand ten or twelve still coarser women, lolling upon the benches and\r\nscattered about singly and in couples.\r\n\r\nHer pulses stood still, her limbs quaked, the gladness went out of her\r\nface. There was a moment of silence, and then a brutal laugh and an\r\nexplosion of cat-calls and hisses saluted her from the audience. The\r\nclamor grew stronger and louder, and insulting speeches were shouted at\r\nher. A half-intoxicated man rose up and threw something, which missed\r\nher but bespattered a chair at her side, and this evoked an outburst of\r\nlaughter and boisterous admiration. She was bewildered, her strength was\r\nforsaking her. She reeled away from the platform, reached the ante-room,\r\nand dropped helpless upon a sofa. The lecture agent ran in, with a\r\nhurried question upon his lips; but she put forth her hands, and with\r\nthe tears raining from her eyes, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, do not speak! Take me away-please take me away, out of this\r\ndreadful place! Oh, this is like all my life--failure, disappointment,\r\nmisery--always misery, always failure. What have I done, to be so\r\npursued! Take me away, I beg of you, I implore you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon the pavement she was hustled by the mob, the surging masses roared\r\nher name and accompanied it with every species of insulting epithet;\r\nthey thronged after the carriage, hooting, jeering, cursing, and even\r\nassailing the vehicle with missiles. A stone crushed through a blind,\r\nwounding Laura's forehead, and so stunning her that she hardly knew what\r\nfurther transpired during her flight.\r\n\r\nIt was long before her faculties were wholly restored, and then she\r\nfound herself lying on the floor by a sofa in her own sitting-room,\r\nand alone. So she supposed she must have sat down upon the sofa and\r\nafterward fallen. She raised herself up, with difficulty, for the air\r\nwas chilly and her limbs were stiff. She turned up the gas and sought\r\nthe glass. She hardly knew herself, so worn and old she looked, and so\r\nmarred with blood were her features. The night was far spent, and a dead\r\nstillness reigned. She sat down by her table, leaned her elbows upon it\r\nand put her face in her hands.\r\n\r\nHer thoughts wandered back over her old life again and her tears flowed\r\nunrestrained. Her pride was humbled, her spirit was broken. Her memory\r\nfound but one resting place; it lingered about her young girlhood with a\r\ncaressing regret; it dwelt upon it as the one brief interval of her life\r\nthat bore no curse. She saw herself again in the budding grace of her\r\ntwelve years, decked in her dainty pride of ribbons, consorting with\r\nthe bees and the butterflies, believing in fairies, holding confidential\r\nconverse with the flowers, busying herself all day long with airy\r\ntrifles that were as weighty to her as the affairs that tax the brains\r\nof diplomats and emperors. She was without sin, then, and unacquainted\r\nwith grief; the world was full of sunshine and her heart was full of\r\nmusic. From that--to this!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could only die!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I could only go back, and be as I\r\nwas then, for one hour--and hold my father's hand in mine again, and see\r\nall the household about me, as in that old innocent time--and then\r\ndie! My God, I am humbled, my pride is all gone, my stubborn heart\r\nrepents--have pity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the spring morning dawned, the form still sat there, the elbows\r\nresting upon the table and the face upon the hands. All day long the\r\nfigure sat there, the sunshine enriching its costly raiment and flashing\r\nfrom its jewels; twilight came, and presently the stars, but still the\r\nfigure remained; the moon found it there still, and framed the picture\r\nwith the shadow of the window sash, and flooded it with mellow light; by\r\nand by the darkness swallowed it up, and later the gray dawn revealed it\r\nagain; the new day grew toward its prime, and still the forlorn presence\r\nwas undisturbed.\r\n\r\nBut now the keepers of the house had become uneasy; their periodical\r\nknockings still finding no response, they burst open the door.\r\n\r\nThe jury of inquest found that death had resulted from heart disease,\r\nand was instant and painless. That was all. Merely heart disease.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\nClay Hawkins, years gone by, had yielded, after many a struggle, to the\r\nmigratory and speculative instinct of our age and our people, and had\r\nwandered further and further westward upon trading ventures.\r\nSettling finally in Melbourne, Australia, he ceased to roam, became a\r\nsteady-going substantial merchant, and prospered greatly. His life lay\r\nbeyond the theatre of this tale.\r\n\r\nHis remittances had supported the Hawkins family, entirely, from the\r\ntime of his father's death until latterly when Laura by her efforts in\r\nWashington had been able to assist in this work. Clay was away on a long\r\nabsence in some of the eastward islands when Laura's troubles began,\r\ntrying (and almost in vain,) to arrange certain interests which had\r\nbecome disordered through a dishonest agent, and consequently he knew\r\nnothing of the murder till he returned and read his letters and papers.\r\nHis natural impulse was to hurry to the States and save his sister\r\nif possible, for he loved her with a deep and abiding affection. His\r\nbusiness was so crippled now, and so deranged, that to leave it would\r\nbe ruin; therefore he sold out at a sacrifice that left him considerably\r\nreduced in worldly possessions, and began his voyage to San Francisco.\r\nArrived there, he perceived by the newspapers that the trial was near\r\nits close. At Salt Lake later telegrams told him of the acquittal, and\r\nhis gratitude was boundless--so boundless, indeed, that sleep was driven\r\nfrom his eyes by the pleasurable excitement almost as effectually as\r\npreceding weeks of anxiety had done it. He shaped his course straight\r\nfor Hawkeye, now, and his meeting with his mother and the rest of the\r\nhousehold was joyful--albeit he had been away so long that he seemed\r\nalmost a stranger in his own home.\r\n\r\nBut the greetings and congratulations were hardly finished when all the\r\njournals in the land clamored the news of Laura's miserable death. Mrs.\r\nHawkins was prostrated by this last blow, and it was well that Clay was\r\nat her side to stay her with comforting words and take upon himself the\r\nordering of the household with its burden of labors and cares.\r\n\r\nWashington Hawkins had scarcely more than entered upon that decade which\r\ncarries one to the full blossom of manhood which we term the beginning\r\nof middle age, and yet a brief sojourn at the capital of the nation had\r\nmade him old. His hair was already turning gray when the late session\r\nof Congress began its sittings; it grew grayer still, and rapidly, after\r\nthe memorable day that saw Laura proclaimed a murderess; it waxed grayer\r\nand still grayer during the lagging suspense that succeeded it and after\r\nthe crash which ruined his last hope--the failure of his bill in the\r\nSenate and the destruction of its champion, Dilworthy. A few days\r\nlater, when he stood uncovered while the last prayer was pronounced over\r\nLaura's grave, his hair was whiter and his face hardly less old than the\r\nvenerable minister's whose words were sounding in his ears.\r\n\r\nA week after this, he was sitting in a double-bedded room in a cheap\r\nboarding house in Washington, with Col. Sellers. The two had been living\r\ntogether lately, and this mutual cavern of theirs the Colonel\r\nsometimes referred to as their \xe2\x80\x9cpremises\xe2\x80\x9d and sometimes as their\r\n\xe2\x80\x9capartments\xe2\x80\x9d--more particularly when conversing with persons outside. A\r\ncanvas-covered modern trunk, marked \xe2\x80\x9cG. W. H.\xe2\x80\x9d stood on end by the door,\r\nstrapped and ready for a journey; on it lay a small morocco satchel,\r\nalso marked \xe2\x80\x9cG. W. H.\xe2\x80\x9d There was another trunk close by--a worn, and\r\nscarred, and ancient hair relic, with \xe2\x80\x9cB. S.\xe2\x80\x9d wrought in brass nails on\r\nits top; on it lay a pair of saddle-bags that probably knew more about\r\nthe last century than they could tell. Washington got up and walked the\r\nfloor a while in a restless sort of way, and finally was about to sit\r\ndown on the hair trunk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, don't sit down on that!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the Colonel: \xe2\x80\x9cThere, now\r\nthat's all right--the chair's better. I couldn't get another trunk like\r\nthat--not another like it in America, I reckon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Washington, with a faint attempt at a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo indeed; the man is dead that made that trunk and that saddle-bags.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre his great-grand-children still living?\xe2\x80\x9d said Washington, with\r\nlevity only in the words, not in the tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don't know--I hadn't thought of that--but anyway they can't\r\nmake trunks and saddle-bags like that, if they are--no man can,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Colonel with honest simplicity. \xe2\x80\x9cWife didn't like to see me going\r\noff with that trunk--she said it was nearly certain to be stolen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Why, aren't trunks always being stolen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes--some kinds of trunks are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then; this is some kind of a trunk--and an almighty rare\r\nkind, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I believe it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, why shouldn't a man want to steal it if he got a chance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I don't know.--Why should he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWashington, I never heard anybody talk like you. Suppose you were a\r\nthief, and that trunk was lying around and nobody watching--wouldn't you\r\nsteal it? Come, now, answer fair--wouldn't you steal it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now, since you corner me, I would take it,--but I wouldn't\r\nconsider it stealing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn't! Well, that beats me. Now what would you call stealing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, taking property is stealing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProperty! Now what a way to talk that is: What do you suppose that\r\ntrunk is worth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it in good repair?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfect. Hair rubbed off a little, but the main structure is perfectly\r\nsound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it leak anywhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeak? Do you want to carry water in it? What do you mean by does it\r\nleak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy--a--do the clothes fall out of it when it is--when it is\r\nstationary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConfound it, Washington, you are trying to make fun of me. I don't know\r\nwhat has got into you to-day; you act mighty curious. What is the matter\r\nwith you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I'll tell you, old friend. I am almost happy. I am, indeed. It\r\nwasn't Clay's telegram that hurried me up so and got me ready to start\r\nwith you. It was a letter from Louise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! What is it? What does she say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe says come home--her father has consented, at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy boy, I want to congratulate you; I want to shake you by the hand!\r\nIt's a long turn that has no lane at the end of it, as the proverb says,\r\nor somehow that way. You'll be happy yet, and Beriah Sellers will be\r\nthere to see, thank God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe it. General Boswell is pretty nearly a poor man, now. The\r\nrailroad that was going to build up Hawkeye made short work of him,\r\nalong with the rest. He isn't so opposed to a son-in-law without a\r\nfortune, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout a fortune, indeed! Why that Tennessee Land--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind the Tennessee Land, Colonel. I am done with that, forever\r\nand forever--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy no! You can't mean to say--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy father, away back yonder, years ago, bought it for a blessing for\r\nhis children, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed he did! Si Hawkins said to me--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt proved a curse to him as long as he lived, and never a curse like it\r\nwas inflicted upon any man's heirs--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm bound to say there's more or less truth--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt began to curse me when I was a baby, and it has cursed every hour of\r\nmy life to this day--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, lord, but it's so! Time and again my wife--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI depended on it all through my boyhood and never tried to do an honest\r\nstroke of work for my living--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight again--but then you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have chased it years and years as children chase butterflies. We\r\nmight all have been prosperous, now; we might all have been happy, all\r\nthese heart-breaking years, if we had accepted our poverty at first and\r\ngone contentedly to work and built up our own wealth by our own toil and\r\nsweat--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's so, it's so; bless my soul, how often I've told Si Hawkins--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of that, we have suffered more than the damned themselves\r\nsuffer! I loved my father, and I honor his memory and recognize his good\r\nintentions; but I grieve for his mistaken ideas of conferring happiness\r\nupon his children. I am going to begin my life over again, and begin\r\nit and end it with good solid work! I'll leave my children no Tennessee\r\nLand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpoken like a man, sir, spoken like a man! Your hand, again my boy! And\r\nalways remember that when a word of advice from Beriah Sellers can help,\r\nit is at your service. I'm going to begin again, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir. I've seen enough to show me where my mistake was. The law\r\nis what I was born for. I shall begin the study of the law. Heavens and\r\nearth, but that Braham's a wonderful man--a wonderful man sir! Such a\r\nhead! And such a way with him! But I could see that he was jealous of\r\nme. The little licks I got in in the course of my argument before the\r\njury--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour argument! Why, you were a witness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, to the popular eye, to the popular eye--but I knew when I was\r\ndropping information and when I was letting drive at the court with an\r\ninsidious argument. But the court knew it, bless you, and weakened every\r\ntime! And Braham knew it. I just reminded him of it in a quiet way, and\r\nits final result, and he said in a whisper, 'You did it, Colonel, you\r\ndid it, sir--but keep it mum for my sake; and I'll tell you what you\r\ndo,' says he, 'you go into the law, Col. Sellers--go into the law, sir;\r\nthat's your native element!' And into the law the subscriber is going.\r\nThere's worlds of money in it!--whole worlds of money! Practice first in\r\nHawkeye, then in Jefferson, then in St. Louis, then in New York! In the\r\nmetropolis of the western world! Climb, and climb, and climb--and wind\r\nup on the Supreme bench. Beriah Sellers, Chief Justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, sir! A made man for all time and eternity!\r\nThat's the way I block it out, sir--and it's as clear as day--clear as\r\nthe rosy-morn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWashington had heard little of this. The first reference to Laura's\r\ntrial had brought the old dejection to his face again, and he stood\r\ngazing out of the window at nothing, lost in reverie.\r\n\r\nThere was a knock-the postman handed in a letter. It was from Obedstown,\r\nEast Tennessee, and was for Washington. He opened it. There was a note\r\nsaying that enclosed he would please find a bill for the current year's\r\ntaxes on the 75,000 acres of Tennessee Land belonging to the estate of\r\nSilas Hawkins, deceased, and added that the money must be paid within\r\nsixty days or the land would be sold at public auction for the taxes,\r\nas provided by law. The bill was for $180--something more than twice the\r\nmarket value of the land, perhaps.\r\n\r\nWashington hesitated. Doubts flitted through his mind. The old instinct\r\ncame upon him to cling to the land just a little longer and give it\r\none more chance. He walked the floor feverishly, his mind tortured by\r\nindecision. Presently he stopped, took out his pocket book and counted\r\nhis money. Two hundred and thirty dollars--it was all he had in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne hundred and eighty . . . . . . . from two hundred and thirty,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nsaid to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cFifty left . . . . . . It is enough to get me home .\r\n. . . . . . Shall I do it, or shall I not? . . . . I wish I had somebody\r\nto decide for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe pocket book lay open in his hand, with Louise's small letter in\r\nview. His eye fell upon that, and it decided him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall go for taxes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand never tempt me or mine any more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe opened the window and stood there tearing the tax bill to bits and\r\nwatching the breeze waft them away, till all were gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe spell is broken, the life-long curse is ended!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe baggage wagon had arrived; five minutes later the two friends were\r\nmounted upon their luggage in it, and rattling off toward the station,\r\nthe Colonel endeavoring to sing \xe2\x80\x9cHomeward Bound,\xe2\x80\x9d a song whose words he\r\nknew, but whose tune, as he rendered it, was a trial to auditors.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\n\r\nPhilip Sterling's circumstances were becoming straightened. The prospect\r\nwas gloomy. His long siege of unproductive labor was beginning to tell\r\nupon his spirits; but what told still more upon them was the undeniable\r\nfact that the promise of ultimate success diminished every day, now.\r\nThat is to say, the tunnel had reached a point in the hill which was\r\nconsiderably beyond where the coal vein should pass (according to all\r\nhis calculations) if there were a coal vein there; and so, every foot\r\nthat the tunnel now progressed seemed to carry it further away from the\r\nobject of the search.\r\n\r\nSometimes he ventured to hope that he had made a mistake in estimating\r\nthe direction which the vein should naturally take after crossing the\r\nvalley and entering the hill. Upon such occasions he would go into\r\nthe nearest mine on the vein he was hunting for, and once more get the\r\nbearings of the deposit and mark out its probable course; but the result\r\nwas the same every time; his tunnel had manifestly pierced beyond the\r\nnatural point of junction; and then his spirits fell a little lower. His\r\nmen had already lost faith, and he often overheard them saying it was\r\nperfectly plain that there was no coal in the hill.\r\n\r\nForemen and laborers from neighboring mines, and no end of experienced\r\nloafers from the village, visited the tunnel from time to time, and\r\ntheir verdicts were always the same and always disheartening--\xe2\x80\x9cNo coal\r\nin that hill.\xe2\x80\x9d Now and then Philip would sit down and think it all over\r\nand wonder what the mystery meant; then he would go into the tunnel and\r\nask the men if there were no signs yet? None--always \xe2\x80\x9cnone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe would bring out a piece of rock and examine it, and say to himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is limestone--it has crinoids and corals in it--the rock is right\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Then he would throw it down with a sigh, and say, \xe2\x80\x9cBut that is nothing;\r\nwhere coal is, limestone with these fossils in it is pretty certain to\r\nlie against its foot casing; but it does not necessarily follow that\r\nwhere this peculiar rock is coal must lie above it or beyond it; this\r\nsign is not sufficient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe thought usually followed:--\xe2\x80\x9cThere is one infallible sign--if I could\r\nonly strike that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThree or four times in as many weeks he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cAm I a\r\nvisionary? I must be a visionary; everybody is in these days; everybody\r\nchases butterflies: everybody seeks sudden fortune and will not lay one\r\nup by slow toil. This is not right, I will discharge the men and go at\r\nsome honest work. There is no coal here. What a fool I have been; I will\r\ngive it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he never could do it. A half hour of profound thinking always\r\nfollowed; and at the end of it he was sure to get up and straighten\r\nhimself and say: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is coal there; I will not give it up; and coal\r\nor no coal I will drive the tunnel clear through the hill; I will not\r\nsurrender while I am alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe never thought of asking Mr. Montague for more money. He said there\r\nwas now but one chance of finding coal against nine hundred and ninety\r\nnine that he would not find it, and so it would be wrong in him to make\r\nthe request and foolish in Mr. Montague to grant it.\r\n\r\nHe had been working three shifts of men. Finally, the settling of a\r\nweekly account exhausted his means. He could not afford to run in debt,\r\nand therefore he gave the men their discharge. They came into his cabin\r\npresently, where he sat with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his\r\nhands--the picture of discouragement and their spokesman said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Sterling, when Tim was down a week with his fall you kept him on\r\nhalf-wages and it was a mighty help to his family; whenever any of us\r\nwas in trouble you've done what you could to help us out; you've acted\r\nfair and square with us every time, and I reckon we are men and know a\r\nman when we see him. We haven't got any faith in that hill, but we have\r\na respect for a man that's got the pluck that you've showed; you've\r\nfought a good fight, with everybody agin you and if we had grub to go\r\non, I'm d----d if we wouldn't stand by you till the cows come home! That\r\nis what the boys say. Now we want to put in one parting blast for luck.\r\nWe want to work three days more; if we don't find anything, we won't\r\nbring in no bill against you. That is what we've come to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip was touched. If he had had money enough to buy three days' \xe2\x80\x9cgrub\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he would have accepted the generous offer, but as it was, he could not\r\nconsent to be less magnanimous than the men, and so he declined in\r\na manly speech; shook hands all around and resumed his solitary\r\ncommunings. The men went back to the tunnel and \xe2\x80\x9cput in a parting blast\r\nfor luck\xe2\x80\x9d anyhow. They did a full day's work and then took their leave.\r\nThey called at his cabin and gave him good-bye, but were not able to\r\ntell him their day's effort had given things a mere promising look.\r\n\r\nThe next day Philip sold all the tools but two or three sets; he also\r\nsold one of the now deserted cabins as old, lumber, together with its\r\ndomestic wares; and made up his mind that he would buy provisions with\r\nthe trifle of money thus gained and continue his work alone. About the\r\nmiddle of the afternoon he put on his roughest clothes and went to the\r\ntunnel. He lit a candle and groped his way in. Presently he heard the\r\nsound of a pick or a drill, and wondered, what it meant. A spark of\r\nlight now appeared in the far end of the tunnel, and when he arrived\r\nthere he found the man Tim at work. Tim said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'm to have a job in the Golden Brier mine by and by--in a week or ten\r\ndays--and I'm going to work here till then. A man might as well be at\r\nsome thing, and besides I consider that I owe you what you paid me when\r\nI was laid up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPhilip said, Oh, no, he didn't owe anything; but Tim persisted, and\r\nthen Philip said he had a little provision now, and would share. So for\r\nseveral days Philip held the drill and Tim did the striking. At first\r\nPhilip was impatient to see the result of every blast, and was always\r\nback and peering among the smoke the moment after the explosion. But\r\nthere was never any encouraging result; and therefore he finally lost\r\nalmost all interest, and hardly troubled himself to inspect results at\r\nall. He simply labored on, stubbornly and with little hope.\r\n\r\nTim staid with him till the last moment, and then took up his job at\r\nthe Golden Brier, apparently as depressed by the continued barrenness of\r\ntheir mutual labors as Philip was himself. After that, Philip fought his\r\nbattle alone, day after day, and slow work it was; he could scarcely see\r\nthat he made any progress.\r\n\r\nLate one afternoon he finished drilling a hole which he had been at work\r\nat for more than two hours; he swabbed it out, and poured in the powder\r\nand inserted the fuse; then filled up the rest of the hole with dirt and\r\nsmall fragments of stone; tamped it down firmly, touched his candle to\r\nthe fuse, and ran.\r\n\r\nBy and by the dull report came, and he was about to walk back\r\nmechanically and see what was accomplished; but he halted; presently\r\nturned on his heel and thought, rather than said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, this is useless, this is absurd. If I found anything it would only\r\nbe one of those little aggravating seams of coal which doesn't mean\r\nanything, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time he was walking out of the tunnel. His thought ran on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am conquered . . . . . . I am out of provisions, out of money. . . .\r\nI have got to give it up . . . . . . All this hard work lost! But I\r\nam not conquered! I will go and work for money, and come back and have\r\nanother fight with fate. Ah me, it may be years, it may, be years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArrived at the mouth of the tunnel, he threw his coat upon the ground,\r\nsat down on a stone, and his eye sought the westering sun and dwelt upon\r\nthe charming landscape which stretched its woody ridges, wave upon wave,\r\nto the golden horizon.\r\n\r\nSomething was taking place at his feet which did not attract his\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nHis reverie continued, and its burden grew more and more gloomy.\r\nPresently he rose up and, cast a look far away toward the valley, and\r\nhis thoughts took a new direction:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is! How good it looks! But down there is not up here. Well, I\r\nwill go home and pack up--there is nothing else to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe moved off moodily toward his cabin. He had gone some distance before\r\nhe thought of his coat; then he was about to turn back, but he smiled at\r\nthe thought, and continued his journey--such a coat as that could be of\r\nlittle use in a civilized land; a little further on, he remembered that\r\nthere were some papers of value in one of the pockets of the relic, and\r\nthen with a penitent ejaculation he turned back picked up the coat and\r\nput it on.\r\n\r\nHe made a dozen steps, and then stopped very suddenly. He stood still a\r\nmoment, as one who is trying to believe something and cannot. He put\r\na hand up over his shoulder and felt his back, and a great thrill shot\r\nthrough him. He grasped the skirt of the coat impulsively and another\r\nthrill followed. He snatched the coat from his back, glanced at it,\r\nthrew it from him and flew back to the tunnel. He sought the spot where\r\nthe coat had lain--he had to look close, for the light was waning--then\r\nto make sure, he put his hand to the ground and a little stream of water\r\nswept against his fingers:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God, I've struck it at last!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lit a candle and ran into the tunnel; he picked up a piece of rubbish\r\ncast out by the last blast, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis clayey stuff is what I've longed for--I know what is behind it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe swung his pick with hearty good will till long after the darkness had\r\ngathered upon the earth, and when he trudged home at length he knew he\r\nhad a coal vein and that it was seven feet thick from wall to wall.\r\n\r\nHe found a yellow envelope lying on his rickety table, and recognized\r\nthat it was of a family sacred to the transmission of telegrams.\r\n\r\nHe opened it, read it, crushed it in his hand and threw it down. It\r\nsimply said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuth is very ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\n\r\nIt was evening when Philip took the cars at the Ilium station. The news\r\nof his success had preceded him, and while he waited for the train, he\r\nwas the center of a group of eager questioners, who asked him a hundred\r\nthings about the mine, and magnified his good fortune. There was no\r\nmistake this time.\r\n\r\nPhilip, in luck, had become suddenly a person of consideration, whose\r\nspeech was freighted with meaning, whose looks were all significant. The\r\nwords of the proprietor of a rich coal mine have a golden sound, and his\r\ncommon sayings are repeated as if they were solid wisdom.\r\n\r\nPhilip wished to be alone; his good fortune at this moment seemed an\r\nempty mockery, one of those sarcasms of fate, such as that which spreads\r\na dainty banquet for the man who has no appetite. He had longed for\r\nsuccess principally for Ruth's sake; and perhaps now, at this very\r\nmoment of his triumph, she was dying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShust what I said, Mister Sederling,\xe2\x80\x9d the landlord of the Ilium hotel\r\nkept repeating. \xe2\x80\x9cI dold Jake Schmidt he find him dere shust so sure as\r\nnoting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to have taken a share, Mr. Dusenheimer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYaas, I know. But d'old woman, she say 'You sticks to your pisiness. So\r\nI sticks to 'em. Und I makes noting. Dat Mister Prierly, he don't never\r\ncome back here no more, ain't it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVell, dere is so many peers, and so many oder dhrinks, I got 'em all\r\nset down, ven he coomes back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a long night for Philip, and a restless one. At any other time\r\nthe swing of the cars would have lulled him to sleep, and the rattle and\r\nclank of wheels and rails, the roar of the whirling iron would have only\r\nbeen cheerful reminders of swift and safe travel. Now they were voices\r\nof warning and taunting; and instead of going rapidly the train seemed\r\nto crawl at a snail's pace. And it not only crawled, but it frequently\r\nstopped; and when it stopped it stood dead still and there was an\r\nominous silence. Was anything the matter, he wondered. Only a station\r\nprobably. Perhaps, he thought, a telegraphic station. And then he\r\nlistened eagerly. Would the conductor open the door and ask for Philip\r\nSterling, and hand him a fatal dispatch?\r\n\r\nHow long they seemed to wait. And then slowly beginning to move, they\r\nwere off again, shaking, pounding, screaming through the night. He drew\r\nhis curtain from time to time and looked out. There was the lurid sky\r\nline of the wooded range along the base of which they were crawling.\r\nThere was the Susquehannah, gleaming in the moon-light. There was a\r\nstretch of level valley with silent farm houses, the occupants all at\r\nrest, without trouble, without anxiety. There was a church, a graveyard,\r\na mill, a village; and now, without pause or fear, the train had mounted\r\na trestle-work high in air and was creeping along the top of it while a\r\nswift torrent foamed a hundred feet below.\r\n\r\nWhat would the morning bring? Even while he was flying to her, her\r\ngentle spirit might have gone on another flight, whither he could not\r\nfollow her. He was full of foreboding. He fell at length into a restless\r\ndoze. There was a noise in his ears as of a rushing torrent when a\r\nstream is swollen by a freshet in the spring. It was like the breaking\r\nup of life; he was struggling in the consciousness of coming death: when\r\nRuth stood by his side, clothed in white, with a face like that of an\r\nangel, radiant, smiling, pointing to the sky, and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cCome.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\nawoke with a cry--the train was roaring through a bridge, and it shot\r\nout into daylight.\r\n\r\nWhen morning came the train was industriously toiling along through the\r\nfat lands of Lancaster, with its broad farms of corn and wheat, its mean\r\nhouses of stone, its vast barns and granaries, built as if, for storing\r\nthe riches of Heliogabalus. Then came the smiling fields of Chester,\r\nwith their English green, and soon the county of Philadelphia itself,\r\nand the increasing signs of the approach to a great city. Long trains\r\nof coal cars, laden and unladen, stood upon sidings; the tracks of other\r\nroads were crossed; the smoke of other locomotives was seen on parallel\r\nlines; factories multiplied; streets appeared; the noise of a busy\r\ncity began to fill the air;--and with a slower and slower clank on the\r\nconnecting rails and interlacing switches the train rolled into the\r\nstation and stood still.\r\n\r\nIt was a hot August morning. The broad streets glowed in the sun, and\r\nthe white-shuttered houses stared at the hot thoroughfares like closed\r\nbakers' ovens set along the highway. Philip was oppressed with the heavy\r\nair; the sweltering city lay as in a swoon. Taking a street car, he rode\r\naway to the northern part of the city, the newer portion, formerly the\r\ndistrict of Spring Garden, for in this the Boltons now lived, in a small\r\nbrick house, befitting their altered fortunes.\r\n\r\nHe could scarcely restrain his impatience when he came in sight of the\r\nhouse. The window shutters were not \xe2\x80\x9cbowed\xe2\x80\x9d; thank God, for that. Ruth\r\nwas still living, then. He ran up the steps and rang. Mrs. Bolton met\r\nhim at the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThee is very welcome, Philip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Ruth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very ill, but quieter than she has been, and the fever is a\r\nlittle abating. The most dangerous time will be when the fever leaves\r\nher. The doctor fears she will not have strength enough to rally from\r\nit. Yes, thee can see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Bolton led the way to the little chamber where Ruth lay. \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nher mother, \xe2\x80\x9cif she were only in her cool and spacious room in our old\r\nhome. She says that seems like heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bolton sat by Ruth's bedside, and he rose and silently pressed\r\nPhilip's hand. The room had but one window; that was wide open to admit\r\nthe air, but the air that came in was hot and lifeless. Upon the table\r\nstood a vase of flowers. Ruth's eyes were closed; her cheeks were\r\nflushed with fever, and she moved her head restlessly as if in pain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuth,\xe2\x80\x9d said her mother, bending over her, \xe2\x80\x9cPhilip is here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRuth's eyes unclosed, there was a gleam of recognition in them, there\r\nwas an attempt at a smile upon her face, and she tried to raise her thin\r\nhand, as Philip touched her forehead with his lips; and he heard her\r\nmurmur,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Phil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to be done but to watch and wait for the cruel fever\r\nto burn itself out. Dr. Longstreet told Philip that the fever had\r\nundoubtedly been contracted in the hospital, but it was not malignant,\r\nand would be little dangerous if Ruth were not so worn down with work,\r\nor if she had a less delicate constitution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is only her indomitable will that has kept her up for weeks. And if\r\nthat should leave her now, there will be no hope. You can do more for\r\nher now, sir, than I can?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Philip eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour presence, more than anything else, will inspire her with the\r\ndesire to live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the fever turned, Ruth was in a very critical condition. For two\r\ndays her life was like the fluttering of a lighted candle in the wind.\r\nPhilip was constantly by her side, and she seemed to be conscious of\r\nhis presence, and to cling to him, as one borne away by a swift stream\r\nclings to a stretched-out hand from the shore. If he was absent a moment\r\nher restless eyes sought something they were disappointed not to find.\r\n\r\nPhilip so yearned to bring her back to life, he willed it so strongly\r\nand passionately, that his will appeared to affect hers and she seemed\r\nslowly to draw life from his.\r\n\r\nAfter two days of this struggle with the grasping enemy, it was evident\r\nto Dr. Longstreet that Ruth's will was beginning to issue its orders to\r\nher body with some force, and that strength was slowly coming back. In\r\nanother day there was a decided improvement. As Philip sat holding her\r\nweak hand and watching the least sign of resolution in her face, Ruth\r\nwas able to whisper,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI so want to live, for you, Phil!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will; darling, you must,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip in a tone of faith and\r\ncourage that carried a thrill of determination--of command--along all\r\nher nerves.\r\n\r\nSlowly Philip drew her back to life. Slowly she came back, as one\r\nwilling but well nigh helpless. It was new for Ruth to feel this\r\ndependence on another's nature, to consciously draw strength of will\r\nfrom the will of another. It was a new but a dear joy, to be lifted up\r\nand carried back into the happy world, which was now all aglow with the\r\nlight of love; to be lifted and carried by the one she loved more than\r\nher own life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSweetheart,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to Philip, \xe2\x80\x9cI would not have cared to come back\r\nbut for thy love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot for thy profession?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, thee may be glad enough of that some day, when thy coal bed is dug\r\nout and thee and father are in the air again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Ruth was able to ride she was taken into the country, for the pure\r\nair was necessary to her speedy recovery. The family went with her.\r\nPhilip could not be spared from her side, and Mr. Bolton had gone up to\r\nIlium to look into that wonderful coal mine and to make arrangements for\r\ndeveloping it, and bringing its wealth to market. Philip had insisted on\r\nre-conveying the Ilium property to Mr. Bolton, retaining only the share\r\noriginally contemplated for himself, and Mr. Bolton, therefore, once\r\nmore found himself engaged in business and a person of some consequence\r\nin Third street. The mine turned out even better than was at first\r\nhoped, and would, if judiciously managed, be a fortune to them all. This\r\nalso seemed to be the opinion of Mr. Bigler, who heard of it as soon as\r\nanybody, and, with the impudence of his class called upon Mr. Bolton for\r\na little aid in a patent car-wheel he had bought an interest in. That\r\nrascal, Small, he said, had swindled him out of all he had.\r\n\r\nMr. Bolton told him he was very sorry, and recommended him to sue Small.\r\n\r\nMr. Small also came with a similar story about Mr. Bigler; and Mr.\r\nBolton had the grace to give him like advice. And he added, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\nand Bigler will procure the indictment of each other, you may have the\r\nsatisfaction of putting each other in the penitentiary for the forgery\r\nof my acceptances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBigler and Small did not quarrel however. They both attacked Mr. Bolton\r\nbehind his back as a swindler, and circulated the story that he had made\r\na fortune by failing.\r\n\r\nIn the pure air of the highlands, amid the golden glories of ripening\r\nSeptember, Ruth rapidly came back to health. How beautiful the world is\r\nto an invalid, whose senses are all clarified, who has been so near the\r\nworld of spirits that she is sensitive to the finest influences, and\r\nwhose frame responds with a thrill to the subtlest ministrations of\r\nsoothing nature. Mere life is a luxury, and the color of the grass,\r\nof the flowers, of the sky, the wind in the trees, the outlines of the\r\nhorizon, the forms of clouds, all give a pleasure as exquisite as the\r\nsweetest music to the ear famishing for it. The world was all new and\r\nfresh to Ruth, as if it had just been created for her, and love filled\r\nit, till her heart was overflowing with happiness.\r\n\r\nIt was golden September also at Fallkill. And Alice sat by the open\r\nwindow in her room at home, looking out upon the meadows where the\r\nlaborers were cutting the second crop of clover. The fragrance of it\r\nfloated to her nostrils. Perhaps she did not mind it. She was thinking.\r\nShe had just been writing to Ruth, and on the table before her was a\r\nyellow piece of paper with a faded four-leaved clover pinned on it--only\r\na memory now. In her letter to Ruth she had poured out her heartiest\r\nblessings upon them both, with her dear love forever and forever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthey will never know\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey never would know. And the world never knows how many women there\r\nare like Alice, whose sweet but lonely lives of self-sacrifice, gentle,\r\nfaithful, loving souls, bless it continually.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is a dear girl,\xe2\x80\x9d said Philip, when Ruth showed him the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Phil, and we can spare a great deal of love for her, our own lives\r\nare so full.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some apology to the reader is necessary in view of our failure\r\nto find Laura's father. We supposed, from the ease with which lost\r\npersons are found in novels, that it would not be difficult. But it was;\r\nindeed, it was impossible; and therefore the portions of the narrative\r\ncontaining the record of the search have been stricken out. Not because\r\nthey were not interesting--for they were; but inasmuch as the man was\r\nnot found, after all, it did not seem wise to harass and excite the\r\nreader to no purpose.\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHORS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Gilded Age, Complete\r\nby Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE GILDED AGE, COMPLETE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 3178-0.txt or 3178-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/3/1/7/3178/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n"
