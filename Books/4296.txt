If ever I did see such a pig!\' said Ellen King, as she\r\nmounted the stairs.  \'I wouldn\'t touch him with a pair of tongs!\'\r\n\r\n\'Who?\' said a voice from the bedroom.\r\n\r\n\'Why, that tramper who has just been in to buy a loaf!  He is a perfect\r\npig, I declare!  I only wonder you did not find of him up here!  The\r\npolice ought to hinder such folk from coming into decent people\'s shops!\r\nThere, you may see him now!\'\r\n\r\n\'Is that he upon the bridge--that chap about the size of our Harold?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes.  Did you ever see such a figure?  His clothes aren\'t good enough\r\nfor a scare-crow--and the dirt, you can\'t see that from here, but you\r\nmight sow radishes in it!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, he\'s swinging on the rail, just as I used to do.  Put me down,\r\nNelly; I don\'t want to see any more.\'  And the eyes filled with tears;\r\nthere was a working about the thin cheeks and the white lips, and a long\r\nsigh came out at last, \'Oh, if I was but like him!\'\r\n\r\n\'Like him!  I\'d wish something else before I wished that,\' said Ellen.\r\n\'Don\'t think about it, Alfred dear; here are Miss Jane\'s pictures.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want the pictures,\' said Alfred wearily, as he laid his head\r\ndown on his white pillow, and shut his eyes because they were hot with\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nEllen looked at him very sadly, and the feeling in her own mind was, that\r\nhe was right, and nothing could make up for the health and strength that\r\nshe knew her mother feared would never return to him.\r\n\r\nThere he lay, the fair hair hanging round the white brow with the furrows\r\nof pain in it, the purple-veined lids closed over the great bright blue\r\neyes, the long fingers hanging limp and delicate as a lady\'s, the limbs\r\nstretched helplessly on the couch, whither it cost him so much pain to be\r\ndaily moved.  Who would have thought, that not six months ago that poor\r\ncripple was the merriest and most active boy in the parish?\r\n\r\nThe room was not a sad-looking one.  There were spotless white dimity\r\ncurtains round the lattice window; and the little bed, and the walnut of\r\nthe great chest, and of the doors of the press-bed on which Alfred lay,\r\nshone with dark and pale grainings.  There was a carpet on the floor, and\r\nthe chairs had chintz cushions; the walls were as white as snow, and\r\nthere were pretty china ornaments on the mantel-piece, many little\r\npictures hanging upon the walls, and quite a shelf of books upon the\r\nwhite cloth, laid so carefully on the top of the drawers.  A little table\r\nbeside Alfred held a glass with a few flowers, a cup with some toast and\r\nwater, a volume of the \'Swiss Family Robinson;\' and a large book of\r\nprints of animals was on a chair where he could reach it.\r\n\r\nA larger table was covered with needle-work, shreds of lining, scissors,\r\ntapes, and Ellen\'s red work-box; and she herself sat beside it, a very\r\nnice-looking girl of about seventeen, tall and slim, her lilac dress and\r\nwhite collar fitting beautifully, her black apron sitting nicely to her\r\ntrim waist, and her light hair shining, like the newly-wound silk of the\r\nsilk-worm, round her pleasant face; where the large, clear, well-opened\r\nblue eyes, and the contrast of white and red on the cheek, were a good\r\ndeal like poor Alfred\'s, and gave an air of delicacy.\r\n\r\nTheir father had been, as their mother said, \'the handsomest coachman who\r\never drove to St. James\'s;\' but he had driven thither once too often; he\r\nhad caught his death of cold one bitter day when Lady Jane Selby was\r\nobliged to go to a drawing-room, and had gone off in a deep decline\r\nfourteen years ago, when the youngest of his five children was not six\r\nweeks old.\r\n\r\nThe Selby family were very kind to Mrs. King, who, besides her husband\'s\r\nclaims on them, had been once in service there; and moreover, had nursed\r\nMiss Jane, the little heiress, Ellen\'s foster-sister.  By their help she\r\nhad been able to use her husband\'s savings in setting up a small shop,\r\nwhere she sold tea, tobacco and snuff, tape, cottons, and such little\r\nmatters, besides capital bread of her own baking, and various\r\nsweet-meats, the best to the taste of her own cooking, the prettiest to\r\nthe eye brought from Elbury.  Oranges too, and apples, shewed their\r\nyellow or rosy cheeks at her window in their season; and there was\r\nsometimes a side of bacon, displaying under the brown coat the delicate\r\npink stripes bordering the white fat.  Of late years one pane of her\r\nwindow had been fitted up with a wooden box, with a slit in it on the\r\noutside, and a whole region round it taken up with printed sheets of\r\npaper about \'Mails to Gothenburg,--Weekly Post to Vancouver\'s Island\'--and\r\nall sorts of places to which the Friarswood people never thought of\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nAltogether, she throve very well; and she was a good woman, whom every\r\none respected for the pains she took to bring up her children well.  The\r\neldest, Charles, had died of consumption soon after his father, and there\r\nhad been much fear for his sister Matilda; but Lady Jane had contrived to\r\nhave her taken as maid to a lady who usually spent the winter abroad, and\r\nthe warm climate had strengthened her health.  She was not often at\r\nFriarswood; but when she came she looked and spoke like a lady--all the\r\nmore so as she gave herself no airs, but was quite simple and humble, for\r\nshe was a very good right-minded young woman, and exceedingly fond of her\r\nhome and her good mother.\r\n\r\nEllen would have liked to copy Matilda in everything; and as a first\r\nstep, she went for a year to a dress-maker; but just as this was over,\r\nAlfred\'s illness had begun; and as he wanted constant care and\r\nattendance, it was thought better that she should take in work at home.\r\nIndeed Alfred was such a darling of hers, that she could not have endured\r\nto go away and leave him so ill.\r\n\r\nAlfred had been a most lively, joyous boy, with higher spirits than he\r\nquite knew what to do with, all fun and good-humour, and yet very\r\ntroublesome and provoking.  He and his brother Harold were the monkeys of\r\nthe school, and really seemed sometimes as if they _could not_ sit still,\r\nnor hinder themselves from making faces, and playing tricks; but that was\r\nthe worst of them--they never told untruths, never did anything mean or\r\nunfair, and could always be made sorry when they had been in fault.  Their\r\nold school-mistress liked them in spite of all the plague they gave her;\r\nand they liked her too, though she had tried upon them every punishment\r\nshe could devise.\r\n\r\nLittle Miss Jane, the orphan whom the Colonel and Mrs. Selby had left to\r\nbe brought up by her grandmother, had a great fancy that Alfred should be\r\na page; and as she generally had her own way, he went up to the Grange\r\nwhen he was about thirteen years old, and put on a suit thickly sown with\r\nbuttons.  But ere the gloss of his new jacket had begun to wear off, he\r\nhad broken four wine-glasses, three cups, and a decanter, all from not\r\nknowing where he was going; he had put sugar instead of salt into the\r\nsalt-cellars at the housekeeper\'s dining-table, that he might see what\r\nshe would say; and he had been caught dressing up Miss Jane\'s Skye\r\nterrier in one of the butler\'s clean cravats; so, though Puck, the\r\naforesaid terrier, liked him better than any other person, Miss Jane not\r\nexcepted, a regular complaint went up of him to my Lady, and he was sent\r\nhome.  He was abashed, and sorry to have vexed mother and disappointed\r\nMiss Jane; but somehow he could not be unhappy when he had Harold to play\r\nwith him again, and he could halloo as loud as they pleased, and stamp\r\nabout in the garden, instead of being always in mind to walk softly.\r\n\r\nThere was the pony too!  A new arrangement had just been made, that the\r\nFriarswood letters should be fetched from Elbury every morning, and then\r\nleft at the various houses of the large straggling district that depended\r\non that post-office.  All letters from thence must be in the post before\r\nfive o\'clock, at which time they were to be sent in to Elbury.  The post-\r\nmaster at Elbury asked if Mrs. King\'s sons could undertake this; and\r\naccordingly she made a great effort, and bought a small shaggy forest\r\npony, whom the boys called \'Peggy,\' and loved not much less than their\r\nsisters.\r\n\r\nIt was all very well in the summer to take those two rides in the cool of\r\nthe morning and evening; but when winter came on, and Alfred had to start\r\nfor Elbury in the tardy dawn of a frosty morning, or still worse, in the\r\ngloom of a wet one, he did not like it at all.  He used to ride in\r\nlooking blue and purple with the chill; and though he went as close to\r\nthe fire as possible, and steamed like the tea-kettle while he ate his\r\nbreakfast and his mother sorted the letters, he had not time to warm\r\nhimself thoroughly before he had to ride off to leave them--two miles\r\nfurther altogether; for besides the bag for the Grange, and all the\r\nletters for the Rectory, and for the farmers, there was a young\r\ngentlemen\'s school at a great old lonely house, called Ragglesford, at\r\nthe end of a very long dreary lane; and many a day Alfred would have\r\ngiven something if those boys\' relations would only have been so good as,\r\nwith one consent, to leave them without letters.\r\n\r\nIt would not have mattered if Alfred had been a stouter boy; but his\r\nmother had always thought he had his poor father\'s constitution, and\r\ntherefore wished him to be more in the house; but his idleness had\r\nprevented his keeping any such place.  It might have been the cold and\r\nwet, or, as Alfred thought, it might have been the strain he gave himself\r\none day when he was sliding on the ice and had a fall; but one morning he\r\ncame in from Elbury very pale, and hobbling, as he said his hip hurt him\r\nso much, that Harold must take the letters round for him.\r\n\r\nHarold took them that morning, and for many another morning and evening\r\nbesides; while poor Alfred came from sitting by the fire to being a\r\nprisoner up-stairs, only moved now and then from his own bed to lie\r\noutside that of his mother, when he could bear it.  The doctor came, and\r\ndid his best; but the disease had thrown itself into the hip joint, and\r\nit was but too plain that Alfred must be a great sufferer for a long\r\ntime, and perhaps a cripple for life.  But how long might this life be?\r\nHis mother dared not think.  Alfred himself, poor boy, was always trying\r\nwith his whole might to believe himself getting better; and Ellen and\r\nHarold always fancied him so, when he was not very bad indeed; but for\r\nthe last fortnight he had been decidedly worse, and his heart and hopes\r\nwere sinking, though he would not own it to himself, and that and the\r\npain made his spirits fail so, that he had been more inclined to be\r\nfretful than any time since his illness had begun.\r\n\r\nHis view from the window was a pleasant one; and when he was pretty well,\r\nafforded him much amusement.  The house stood in a neat garden, with\r\ngreen railings between it and the road, over which Alfred could see every\r\none who came and went towards Elbury, and all who had business at the\r\npost-office, or at Farmer Shepherd\'s.  Opposite was the farm-yard; and if\r\nnothing else was going on, there were always cocks and hens, ducks and\r\nturkeys, pigs, cows, or horses, to be seen there; and the cow-milking, or\r\nthe taking the horses down to the water, the pig-feeding, and the like,\r\nwere a daily amusement.  Sloping down from the farm-yard, the ground led\r\nto the river, a smooth clear stream, where the white ducks looked very\r\npretty, swimming, diving, and \'standing tail upwards;\' and there was a\r\nhigh-arched bridge over it, where Alfred could get a good view of the\r\ncarriages that chanced to come by, and had lately seen all the young\r\ngentlemen of Ragglesford going home for the summer holidays, making such\r\na whooping and hurrahing, that the place rang again; and beyond, there\r\nwere beautiful green meadows, with a straight path through them, leading\r\nto a stile; and beyond that, woods rose up, and there was a little\r\nglimpse of a stately white house peeping through them.  Hay-making was\r\ngoing on merrily in the field, under the bright summer sun, and the air\r\nwas full of the sweet smell of the grass, but there was something sultry\r\nand oppressive to the poor boy\'s feelings; and when he remembered how\r\nFarmer Shepherd had called him to lend a hand last year, and how happy he\r\nhad been tossing the hay, and loading the waggon, a sad sick feeling\r\ncrept over him; and so it was that the tears rose in his eyes, and he\r\nmade his sister lay him back on the pillow, for he did not wish to see\r\nany more.\r\n\r\nEllen worked and thought, and wanted to entertain him, but could not\r\nthink how.  Presently she burst out, however, \'Oh, Alfred! there\'s Harold\r\ncoming running back!  There he is, jumping over that hay-cock--not\r\ntouched the ground once--another--oh! there\'s Farmer Shepherd coming\r\nafter him!\'\r\n\r\n\'Hold your tongue,\' muttered Alfred moodily, as if each of her words gave\r\nhim unbearable pain; and he hid his face in the pillow.\r\n\r\nEllen kept silence for ten minutes, and then broke forth again, \'Now\r\nthen, Alfred, you _will_ be glad!  There\'s Miss Jane getting over the\r\nstile.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want Miss Jane,\' grumbled Alfred; and as Ellen sprang up and\r\nbegan smoothing his coverings, collecting her scraps, and tidying the\r\nroom, already so neat, he growled again, \'What a racket you keep!\'\r\n\r\n\'There, won\'t you be raised up to see her?  She does look so pretty in\r\nher new pink muslin, with a double skirt, and her little hat and feather,\r\nthat came from London; and there\'s Puck poking in the hay--he\'s looking\r\nfor a mouse!  And she\'s showering the hay over him with her parasol!  Oh,\r\nlook, Alfred!\' and she was going to lift him up, but he only murmured a\r\ncross \'Can\'t you be quiet?\' and she let him alone, but went on talking:\r\n\'Ah, there\'s Puck\'s little tail wriggling out--hinder-end foremost--here\r\nhe comes--they are touching their hats to her now, the farmer and all,\r\nand she nods just like a little queen!  She\'s got her basket, Alfred.  I\r\nwonder what she has for you in it!  Oh dear, there\'s that strange boy on\r\nthe bridge!  She won\'t like that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, what would he do to her?  He won\'t bite her,\' said Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, if he spoke to her, or begged of her, she\'d be so frightened!  There,\r\nhe looked at her, and she gave such a start.  You little vagabond!  I\'d\r\nlike to--\'\r\n\r\n\'Stuff! what could he do to her, with all the hay-field and Farmer\r\nShepherd there to take care of her?  What a fuss you do make!\' said poor\r\nAlfred, who was far too miserable just then to agree with any one, though\r\nat almost any other time he would have longed to knock down any strange\r\nboy who did but dare to pass Miss Selby without touching his cap; and her\r\nvisits were in general the very light of his life.\r\n\r\nThey were considered a great favour; for though old Lady Jane Selby was a\r\ngood, kind-hearted person, still she had her fancies, and she kept her\r\nyoung grand-daughter like some small jewel, as a thing to be folded up in\r\na case, and never trusted in common.  She was afraid to allow her to go\r\nabout the village, or into the school and cottages, always fancying she\r\nmight be made ill, or meet with some harm; but Mrs. King being an old\r\nservant, whom she knew so well, and the way lying across only two meadows\r\nbeyond Friarswood Park, the little pet was allowed to go so far to visit\r\nher foster-mother, and bring whatever she could devise to cheer the poor\r\nsick boy.\r\n\r\nMiss Jane, though of the same age as Ellen, and of course with a great\r\ndeal more learning and accomplishment, had been so little used to help\r\nherself, or to manage anything, that she was like one much younger.  The\r\nsight of the rough stranger on the bridge was really startling to her,\r\nand she came across the road and garden as fast as she could without a\r\nrun; and the first thing the brother and sister heard, was her voice\r\nsaying rather out of breath and fluttered, \'Oh, what a horrid-looking\r\nboy!\'\r\n\r\nSeeing that Mrs. King was serving some one in the shop, she only nodded\r\nto her, and came straight up-stairs.  Alfred raised up his head, and\r\nbeheld the little fairy through the open door, first the head, and the\r\nsmiling little face and slight figure in the fresh summer dress.\r\n\r\nMiss Jane was not thought very pretty by strangers; but that dainty\r\nlittle person, and sweet sunny eyes and merry smile, and shy, kind,\r\ngracious ways, were perfect in the eyes of her grandmamma and of Mrs.\r\nKing and her children, if of nobody else.  Alfred, in his present dismal\r\nstate, only felt vexed at a fresh person coming up to worry him, and make\r\na talking; especially one whose presence was a restraint, so that he\r\ncould not turn about and make cross answers at his will.\r\n\r\n\'Well, Alfred, how are you to-day?\' said the sweet gay voice, a little\r\nsubdued.\r\n\r\n\'Better, Ma\'am, thank you,\' said Alfred, who always called himself\r\nbetter, whatever he felt; but his voice told the truth better than his\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s had a very bad night, Miss Jane,\' said his sister; \'no sleep at all\r\nsince two o\'clock, and he is so low to-day, that I don\'t know what to do\r\nwith him.\'\r\n\r\nAlfred hated nothing so much as to hear that he was low, for it meant\r\nthat he was cross.\r\n\r\n\'Poor Alfred!\' said the young lady kindly.  \'Was it pain that kept you\r\nawake?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Ma\'am--not so much--\' said the boy.\r\n\r\nMiss Jane saw he looked very sad, and hoped to cheer him by opening her\r\nbasket.  \'I\'ve brought you a new book, Alfred.  It is "The\r\nCherry-stones."  Have you finished the last?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Ma\'am.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did you like it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, Ma\'am.\'\r\n\r\nBut it was a very matter-of-course sort of Yes, and disappointed Miss\r\nJane, who thought he would have been charmed with the \'Swiss Family\r\nRobinson.\'\r\n\r\nEllen spoke: \'Oh yes, Alfred, you know you did like it.  I heard you\r\nlaughing to yourself at Ernest and the shell of soup.  And Harold reads\r\nthat; and \'tis so seldom he will look at a book.\'\r\n\r\nJane did not like this quite as well as if Alfred had spoken up more; but\r\nshe dived into her basket again, and brought out a neat little packet of\r\ngreen leaves, with some strawberries done up in it, and giving a little\r\nsmile, she made sure that it would be acceptable.\r\n\r\nEllen thanked vehemently, and Alfred gave feeble thanks; but, unluckily,\r\nhe had so set his mind upon raspberries, that he could not enjoy the\r\nthought of anything else.  It was a sickly distaste for everything, and\r\nMiss Selby saw that he was not as much pleased as she meant him to be;\r\nshe looked at him wistfully, and, half grieved, half impatient, she\r\nlonged to know what he would really like, or if he were positively\r\nungrateful.  She was very young, and did not know whether it was by his\r\nfault or her mistake that she had failed to satisfy him.\r\n\r\nPuck had raced up after her, and had come poking and snuffling round\r\nAlfred.  She would have called him away lest he should be too much for\r\none so weak, but she saw Alfred really did enjoy this: his hand was in\r\nthe long rough coat, and he was whispering, \'Poor Puck,\' and \'Good little\r\ndoggie;\' and the little hairy rummaging creature, with the bright black\r\nbeads of eyes gleaming out from under his shaggy hair, was doing him more\r\ngood than her sense and kindness, or Ellen\'s either.\r\n\r\nShe turned to the window, and said to Ellen, \'What a wild-looking lad\r\nthat is on the bridge!\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, Miss Jane,\' said Ellen; \'I was quite afraid he would frighten you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I was surprised,\' said Jane; \'I was afraid he might speak to me;\r\nbut then I knew I was too near friends for harm to come to me;\' and she\r\nlaughed at her own fears.  \'How ragged and wretched he looks!  Has he\r\nbeen begging?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Miss Jane; he came into the shop, and bought some bread.  He paid\r\nfor it honestly; but I never did see any one so dirty.  And there\'s\r\nAlfred wishing to be like him.  I knew you would tell him it is quite\r\nwicked, Miss Jane.\'\r\n\r\nIt is not right, I suppose, to wish to be anything but what we are,\' said\r\nJane, rather puzzled by the appeal; \'and perhaps that poor beggar-boy\r\nwould only like to have a nice room, and kind mother and sister, like\r\nyou, Alfred.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t say anything against them!\' cried the boy vehemently;\r\n\'but--but--I\'d give anything--anything in the world--to be able to run\r\nabout again in the hay-field!  No, don\'t talk to me, Ellen, I say--I hate\r\nthem all when I see them there, and I forced to lie here!  I wish the sun\r\nwould never shine!\'\r\n\r\nHe hid his eyes and ears in the pillow, as if he never wished to see the\r\nlight again, and would hear nothing.  The two girls both stood trembling.\r\nEllen looked at Miss Selby, and she felt that she must say something.  But\r\nwhat could she say?\r\n\r\nWith tears in her eyes she laid hold of Alfred\'s thin hand and tried to\r\nspeak, choked by tears.  \'Dear Alfred, don\'t say such dreadful things.\r\nYou know we are all so sorry for you; but God sent it.\'\r\n\r\nAlfred gave a groan of utter distress, as if it were no consolation.\r\n\r\n\'And--and things come to do us good,\' continued Miss Jane, the tears\r\nstarting to her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know what good it can do me to lie here!\' cried Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, but, Alfred, it must.\'\r\n\r\n\'I tell you,\' exclaimed the poor boy, forgetting his manners, so that\r\nEllen stood dismayed, \'it does not do me good!  I didn\'t use to hate\r\nHarold, nor to hate everybody.\'\r\n\r\n\'To hate Harold!\' said Jane faintly.\r\n\r\n\'Ay,\' said Alfred, \'when I hear him whooping about like mad, and jumping\r\nand leaping, and going on like I used to do, and never shall again.\'\r\n\r\nThe tears came thick and fast, and perhaps they did him good.\r\n\r\n\'But, Alfred,\' said Jane, trying to puzzle into the right thing,\r\n\'sometimes things are sent to punish us, and then we ought to submit\r\nquietly.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know what I\'ve done, then,\' he cried angrily.  \'There have been\r\nmany worse than I any day, that are well enough now.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Alfred, it is not who is worse, but what one is oneself,\' said Jane.\r\n\r\nAlfred grunted.\r\n\r\n\'I wish I knew how to help you,\' she said earnestly; \'it is so very sad\r\nand hard; and I dare say I should be just as bad myself if I were as ill;\r\nbut do, pray, Alfred, try to think that nobody sent it but God, and that\r\nHe must know best.\'\r\n\r\nAlfred did not seem to take in much comfort, and Jane did not believe she\r\nwas putting it rightly; but it was time for her to go home, so she said\r\nanxiously, \'Good-bye, Alfred; I hope you\'ll be better next time--and--and--\'\r\nShe bent down and spoke in a very frightened whisper, \'You know when we\r\ngo to church, we pray you may have patience under your sufferings.\'\r\n\r\nThen she sprang away, as if ashamed of the sound of her own words; but as\r\nshe was taking up her basket and wishing Ellen good-bye, she saw that the\r\nstrange lad had moved nearer the house, and timid little thing as she\r\nwas, she took out a sixpence, and said, \'Do give him that, and ask him to\r\ngo away.\'\r\n\r\nEllen had no very great fancy for facing the enemy herself, but she made\r\nno objection; and looking down-stairs, she saw her brother Harold waiting\r\nwhile his mother stamped the letters, and she called to him, and sent him\r\nout to the boy.\r\n\r\nHe came back in a few moments so much amazed, that she could see the\r\nwhites all round his eyes.\r\n\r\n\'He won\'t have it!  He\'s a rum one that!  He says he\'s no beggar, and\r\nthat if the young lady would give him work, he\'d thank her; but he wants\r\nnone of her money, and he\'ll stand where he chooses!\'\r\n\r\n\'Why didn\'t you lick him?\' hallooed out Alfred\'s voice from his bed.  \'Oh!\r\nif I--\'\r\n\r\n\'Nonsense, Alfred!\' cried Miss Jane, frightened into spirit; \'stand\r\nstill, Harold!  I don\'t mind him.\'\r\n\r\nAnd she put up her parasol, and walked straight out at the house door as\r\nbold as a little lioness, going on without looking to the right or left.\r\n\r\n\'_If_--\' began Harold, clenching his fists--and Alfred raised himself\r\nupon his bed with flashing eyes to watch, as the boy had moved nearer,\r\nand looked for a moment as if he were going to grin, or say something\r\nimpudent; but the quiet childish form stepping on so simply and steadily\r\nseemed to disarm him, and he shrunk back, left her to trip across the\r\nroad unmolested, and stood leaning over the rail of the bridge, gazing\r\nafter her as she crossed the hay-field.\r\n\r\nHarold rode off with the letters; and Alfred lay gazing, and wondering\r\nwhat that stranger could be, counting the holes in his garments, and\r\ntrying to guess at his history.\r\n\r\nOne good thing was, that Alfred was so much carried out of himself, that\r\nhe was cheerful all the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II--HAY-MAKING\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was again a sultry night, which brought on so much discomfort and\r\nrestlessness, that poor Alfred could not sleep.  He tried to bear in mind\r\nhow much he had disturbed his mother the night before, and he checked\r\nhimself several times when he felt as if he could not bear it any longer\r\nwithout waking her, and to remember his old experience, that do what she\r\nwould for him, it would be no real relief, and he should only be sorry\r\nthe next day when he saw her going about her work with a worn face and a\r\nhead-ache.\r\n\r\nThen every now and then Miss Selby\'s words about being patient came back\r\nto him.  Sometimes he thought them hard, coming from a being who had\r\nnever known sickness or sorrow, and wondered how she would feel if laid\r\nlow as he was; but they would not be put away in that manner, for he knew\r\nthey were true, and were said by others than Miss Jane, though he had\r\nbegun to think no phrase so tiresome, hopeless, or provoking.  People\r\nalways told him to be patient when they had no comfort to give him, and\r\ndid not know what he was suffering.  He would not have minded it so much\r\nif only he could have got it out of his head.  Somehow it would not let\r\nhim call to his mother, if it was only because very likely all he should\r\nget by so doing would be to be again told to be patient.  And then came\r\nMiss Jane\'s telling him his illness might be good for him, as if she\r\nthought he deserved to be punished.  Really that was hard!  Who could\r\nthink he deserved this wearing pain and helplessness, only because he had\r\nplayed tricks on the butler and housekeeper, and now and then laughed at\r\nchurch?\r\n\r\n\'It is just like Job and his friends,\' thought Alfred.  \'I don\'t want her\r\nto come and see me any more!\'\r\n\r\nPoor Alfred!  There was a little twinge here.  His conscience could not\r\ngive quite such an account as did that of Job!  But he did not like\r\nrecollecting his own errors better than any of us do, and liked much more\r\nto feel himself very hardly used, and greatly to be pitied.  Thereupon he\r\nopened his lips to call to his mother, but that old thought about\r\npatience returned on him; he had mercy on her regular breathing, though\r\nit made him quite envious to hear it, and he said to himself that he\r\nwould let her alone, at least till the next time the clock struck.  It\r\nwould be three o\'clock next time.  Oh dear, would the night never be\r\nover?  How often such a round of weary thoughts came again and again can\r\nhardly be counted; but, at any rate, poor Alfred was exercising one act\r\nof forbearance, and that was so much gain.  At last he found, by the\r\nincreasing light shewing him the shapes of all the pictures, that he must\r\nhave had a short sleep which had made him miss the clock, and he felt a\r\ngood deal injured thereby.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mrs. King was too good a nurse not to be awakened by his first\r\nmovement, and she came to him, gave him some cold tea, and settled his\r\npillow so as to make him more comfortable; and when he begged her to let\r\nin a little more air, she went to open the window wider, and relieve the\r\ncloseness of the little room.  She had learnt while living with Lady Jane\r\nthat night air is not so dangerous as some people fancy; and it was an\r\ninfinite relief to Alfred when the lattice was thrown back, and the cool\r\nbreeze came softly in, with the freshness of the dew, and the delicious\r\nscent of the hay-field.\r\n\r\nMrs. King stood a moment to look out at the beautiful stillness of early\r\ndawn, the trees and meads so gravely calmly quiet, and the silver dew\r\nlying white over everything; the tanned hay-cocks rising up all over the\r\nfield, the morning star and waning moon glowing pale as light of morning\r\nspread over the sky.  Then a cock crew somewhere at a distance, and Mrs.\r\nShepherd\'s cock answered him more shrilly close by, and the swallows\r\nbegan to twitter under the eaves.\r\n\r\n\'It _will_ be a fine day, to be sure!\' she said.  \'The farmer will get in\r\nhis hay!\' and then she stood looking as if something had caught her\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\'What do you see, Mother?\' asked Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'I was looking what that was under yon hay-cock,\' said Mrs. King; \'and I\r\ndo believe it is some one sleeping there.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ha!\' cried Alfred.  \'I dare say it is the boy that would not have Miss\r\nJane\'s sixpence.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure I hope he\'s after no harm,\' said Mrs. King; \'I don\'t like to\r\nhave tramps about so near.  I hope he means no mischief by the farmer\'s\r\npoultry.\'\r\n\r\n\'He can\'t be one of that sort, or he wouldn\'t have refused the money,\'\r\nsaid Alfred.  \'How nice and cool it must be sleeping in the hay!  I\'ll\r\nwarrant he doesn\'t lie awake.  I wish I was there!\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll know what to be thankful for one of these days, my poor lad,\'\r\nsaid his mother, sighing; then yawning, she said, \'I must go back to bed.\r\nMind you call out, Alfred, if you hear anything like a noise in the farm-\r\nyard.\'\r\n\r\nThis notion rather interested Alfred; he began to build up a fine scheme\r\nof shouting out and sending Harold to the rescue of the cocks and hens,\r\nand how well he would have done it himself a year ago, and pinned the\r\nthief, and fastened the door on him.  Not that he thought this individual\r\nlad at all likely to be a thief, nor did he care much for Farmer\r\nShepherd, who was a hard man and no favourite; but to catch a thief would\r\nbe a grand feat.  And while settling his clever plan, and making some\r\ncompliments for the magistrate to pay him, Alfred, fanned by the cool\r\nbreeze, fell into a sound sleep, and did not wake till the sun was high,\r\nand all the rest of the house were up and dressed.\r\n\r\nThat good sleep made him much more able to bear the burden of the day.\r\nFirst, his mother came with the towel and basin, and washed his face and\r\nhands; and then he had his little book, and said his prayers; and somehow\r\nto-day he felt so much less fractious than usual, that he asked to be\r\ntaught patience, and not _only_ to be made well, as he had hitherto done.\r\n\r\nThat over, he lay smiling as he waited for his breakfast, and when Ellen\r\nbrought it to him, he had not one complaint to make, but ate it almost\r\nwith a relish.  \'Is that boy gone?\' he asked Ellen, as she tidied the\r\nroom while he was eating.\r\n\r\n\'What, the dirty boy?  No, there he is, speaking to the farmer.  Will he\r\nbeg of him?\'\r\n\r\n\'Asking for work, more likely.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'d sooner give work to a pig at once,\' said Ellen; \'but I do believe\r\nhe\'s getting it.  I fancy they are short of hands for the hay.  Yes, he\'s\r\npointing into the field.  Ay, and he\'s sending him into the yard.\'\r\n\r\n\'I hope he\'ll give him some breakfast,\' said Alfred.  \'Do you know he\r\nslept all night on a hay-cock?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, so Mother said, just like a dog; and he got up like a dog this\r\nmorning,--never so much as washed himself at the river.  Why, he\'s coming\r\nhere!  Whatever does he want?\'\r\n\r\n\'The lad?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, the farmer.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Shepherd\'s heavy tread was heard below, and, as Alfred said, Ellen\r\nhad only to hold her tongue for them be able to hear his loud tones\r\ntelling Mrs. King that the glass was falling, and his hay in capital\r\norder, and his hands short, and asking whether her boy Harold would come\r\nand help in the hay-field between the post times.  Mrs. King gave a ready\r\nanswer that the boy would be well pleased, and the farmer promised him\r\nhis victuals and sixpence for the day.  \'Your lass wouldn\'t like to come\r\ntoo, I suppose, eh?\'\r\n\r\nEllen flushed with indignation.  She go a hay-making!  Her mother was\r\ncivilly making answer that her daughter was engaged with her sick\r\nbrother, and besides--had her work for Mrs. Price, which must be finished\r\noff.  The farmer, saying he had not much expected her, but thought she\r\nmight like a change from moping over her needle, went off.\r\n\r\nEllen did not feel ready to forgive him for wanting to set her to field-\r\nwork.  There is some difference between being fine and being refined, and\r\nin Ellen\'s station of life it is very difficult to hit the right point.\r\nTo be refined is to be free from all that is rough, coarse, or ungentle;\r\nto be fine, is to affect to be above such things.  Now Ellen was really\r\nrefined in her quietness and maidenly modesty, and there was no need for\r\nher to undertake any of those kinds of tasks which, by removing young\r\ngirls from home shelter, do sometimes help to make them rude and\r\nindecorous; but she was _fine_, when she gave herself a little mincing\r\nair of contempt, as if she despised the work and those who did it.  Lydia\r\nGrant, who worked so steadily and kept to herself so modestly, that no\r\none ventured a bold word to her as she tossed her hay, was just as\r\nrefined as Ellen King behind her white blinds, ay, or as Jane Selby\r\nherself in her terraced garden.  Refinement is in the mind that loves\r\nwhatsoever is pure, lovely, and of good report; finery is in disdaining\r\nwhat is homely or humble.\r\n\r\nBoys of all degrees are usually, when they are good for anything, the\r\ngreatest enemies of the finery tending to affectation; and Alfred at once\r\nbegan to make a little fun of his sister, and tell her it would be a\r\nfamous thing for her, he believed she had quite forgotten how to run, and\r\ndid not know a rake from a fork when she saw it.  He knew she was longing\r\nfor a ride in the waggon, if she would but own it.\r\n\r\nEllen used to be teased by this kind of joking; but she was too glad to\r\nsee Alfred well enough so to entertain himself, to think of anything but\r\npleasing him, so she answered good-humouredly that Harold must make hay\r\nfor them all three to-day, no doubt but he would be pleased enough.\r\n\r\nHe was heard trotting home at this moment, and whistling as he hitched up\r\nthe pony at the gate, and ran in with the letter-bag, to snap up his\r\nbreakfast while the letters were sorted.\r\n\r\n\'Here, let me have them,\' called Alfred, and they were glad he should do\r\nit, for he was the quickest of the family at reading handwriting; but he\r\nwas often too ill to attend to it, and more often the weary fretfulness\r\nand languor of his state made him dislike to exert himself, so it was apt\r\nto depend on his will or caprice.\r\n\r\n\'Look sharp, Alf!\' hallooed out Harold, rushing up-stairs with the bags\r\nin one hand, and his bread-and-butter in the other.  \'If you find a\r\nletter for that there Ragglesford, I don\'t know what I shall do to you!  I\r\nmust be back in no time for the hay!\'\r\n\r\nAnd he had bounced down-stairs again before Ellen had time to scold him\r\nfor making riot enough to shake Alfred to pieces.  He was a fine tall\r\nstout boy, with the same large fully open blue eyes, high colour, white\r\nteeth, and light curly hair, as his brother and sister, but he was much\r\nmore sunburnt.  If you saw him with his coat off, he looked as if he had\r\nred gloves and a red mask on, so much whiter was his skin where it was\r\ncovered; and he was very strong for his age, and never had known what\r\nillness was.  The brothers were very fond of each other, but since Alfred\r\nhad been laid up, they had often been a great trial to each other--the\r\none seemed as little able to live without making a noise, as the other to\r\nendure the noise he made; and the sight of Harold\'s activity and the\r\nsound of his feet and voice, vexed the poor helpless sufferer more than\r\nthey ought to have done, or than they would had the healthy brother been\r\nless thoughtless in the joy of his strength.\r\n\r\nTo-day, however, all was smooth.  Alfred did not feel every tread of\r\nthose bounding limbs like a shock to his poor diseased frame; and he only\r\nlaughed as he unlocked the leathern bag, and dealt out the letters,\r\nputting all those for the Lady Jane Selby, Miss Selby, and the servants,\r\ninto their own neat little leathern case with the padlock, and sorting\r\nout the rest, with some hope there might be one from Matilda, who was a\r\nvery good one to write home.  There was none from her, but then there was\r\nnone for Ragglesford, and that was unexpected good luck.  If the old\r\nhousekeeper left in charge had been wicked enough to get her newspaper\r\nthat day, Alfred felt that in Harold\'s place he should be sorely tempted\r\nto chuck it over the hedge.  Ellen looked as if he had talked of\r\nmurdering her, and truly such a breach of trust would have been a very\r\ngrievous fault.\r\n\r\n\'The Reverend--what\'s his name? the Reverend Marcus Cope, Friarswood,\r\nnear Elbury,\' read Alfred; \'one, two, three letters, and a newspaper.\r\nYes, and this long printed-looking thing.  Who is he, Ellen?\'\r\n\r\n\'What did you say?\' said Ellen, who was busy shaking her mother\'s bed,\r\nand had not heard at the first moment, but now turned eagerly; \'what did\r\nyou say his name was?\'\r\n\r\n\'The Reverend Marcus Cope,\' repeated Alfred.  \'Is that another new\r\nparson?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, did not we tell you what a real beautiful sermon the new clergyman\r\npreached on Sunday?  Mr. Cope, so that\'s his name.  I wonder if he is\r\ncome to stay.--Mother,\' she ran to the head of the stairs, \'the new\r\nclergyman\'s name is the Reverend Mr. Marcus Cope.\'\r\n\r\n\'He don\'t live at Ragglesford, I hope!\' cried Harold, who regarded any\r\none at the end of that long lane as his natural enemy.\r\n\r\n\'No, it only says Friarswood,\' said Ellen.  \'You\'ll have to find out\r\nwhere he lives, Harold.\'\r\n\r\n\'Pish! it will take me an hour going asking about!\' said Harold\r\nimpatiently.  \'He must have his letters left here till he chooses to come\r\nfor them, if he doesn\'t know where he lives.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no, Harold, that won\'t do,\' said Mrs. King.  \'You must take the\r\ngentleman his letters, and they\'ll be sure to know at the Park, or at the\r\nRectory, or at the Tankard, where he lodges.  Well, it will be a real\r\ncomfort if he is come to stop.\'\r\n\r\nSo Harold went off with the letters and the pony, and Ellen and her\r\nmother exchanged a few words about the gentleman and his last Sunday\'s\r\nsermon, and then Ellen went to dust the shop, and put out the bread,\r\nwhile her mother attended to Alfred\'s wound, the most painful part of the\r\nday to both of them.\r\n\r\nIt was over, however, and Alfred was resting afterwards when Harold\r\ncantered home as hard as the pony could or would go, and came racing up\r\nto say, \'I\'ve seen him!  He\'s famous!  He stood out in the road and met\r\nme, and asked for his letters, and he\'s to be at the Parsonage, and he\r\nasked my name, and then he laughed and said, "Oh!  I perceive it is the\r\nroyal mail!"  I didn\'t know what he was at, but he looked as\r\ngood-humoured as anything.  Halloo! give me my old hat, Nell--that\'s it!\r\nHurrah! for the hay-waggon!  I saw the horses coming out!\'\r\n\r\nAnd off he went again full drive; and Alfred did nothing worse than give\r\na little groan.\r\n\r\nEllen had enough to do in wondering about Mr. Cope.  News seemed to\r\nbelong of right to the post-office, and it was odd that he should have\r\npreached on Sunday, and now it should be Tuesday, without anything having\r\nbeen heard of him, not even from Miss Jane; but then the young lady had\r\nbeen fluttered by the strange boy, and Alfred had been so fretful, that\r\nit might have put everything out of her head.\r\n\r\nFriarswood was used to uncertainty about the clergyman.  The Rector had\r\nfallen into such bad health, that he had long been unable to do anything,\r\nand always hoping to get better, he had sent different gentlemen to take\r\nthe services, first one and then another, or had asked the masters at\r\nRagglesford to help him; but it was all very irregular, and no one had\r\nsettled down long enough to know the people or do much good in visiting\r\nthem.  My Lady, as they all called Lady Jane, was as sorry as any one\r\ncould be, and she tried what she could do by paying a very good school-\r\nmaster and mistress, and giving plenty of rewards; but nothing could be\r\nlike the constant care of a real good clergyman, and the people were all\r\nthe worse for the want.  They had the church to go to, but it was not\r\nbrought home to them.  The Rector had been obliged at last to go abroad,\r\none of the Ragglesford gentlemen had performed the service for the\r\nensuing Sundays, until now there seemed to be a chance that this new\r\nclergyman was coming to stay.\r\n\r\nThis interested Alfred less than his sister.  His curiosity was chiefly\r\nabout the strange lad; and when he was moved to his place by the window\r\nhe turned his eyes anxiously to make him out in the line of hay-makers,\r\ntwo fields off, as they shook out the grass to give it the day\'s\r\nsunshine.  He knew them all, the ten women, with their old straw bonnets\r\npoked down over their faces, and deep curtains sewn on behind to guard\r\ntheir necks; the farm men come in from their other work to lend a hand,\r\nthree or four boys, among whom he could see Harold\'s white shirt sleeves,\r\nand sometimes hear his merry laugh, and he was working next to the figure\r\nin brown faded-looking tattered array, which Alfred suspected to belong\r\nto the strange boy.  So did Ellen.  \'Ah!\' she said, \'Harold ye scraped\r\nacquaintance with that vagabond-looking boy; I wish I had warned him\r\nagainst it, but I suppose he would only have done it all the more.\'\r\n\r\n\'You want to make friends with him yourself, Ellen!  We shall have you\r\nnodding to him next!  You are as curious about him as can be!\' said\r\nAlfred slyly.\r\n\r\n\'Me!  I never was curious about nothing so insignificant,\' said Ellen.\r\n\'All I wish is, that that boy may not be running into bad company.\'\r\n\r\nThe hay-fields were like an entertainment on purpose for Alfred all day;\r\nhe watched the shaking of the brown grass all over the meadows in the\r\nmorning, and the farmer walking over it, and smelling it, and spying up\r\nto guess what would come of the great rolling towers of grey clouds edged\r\nwith pearly white, soft but dazzling, which varied the intense blue of\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nThen he watched all the company sit or lie down on the shady side of the\r\nhedge, under the pollard-willows, and Tom Boldre the shuffler and one or\r\ntwo more go into the farm-house, and come out with great yellow-ware with\r\npies in them, and the little sturdy-looking kegs of beer, and two mugs to\r\ngo round among them all.  There was Harold lying down, quite at his ease,\r\nclose to the strange boy; Alfred knew how much better that dinner would\r\ntaste to him than the best with the table-cloth neatly spread in his\r\nmother\'s kitchen; and well did Alfred remember how much more enjoyment\r\nthere was in such a meal as that, than in any one of the dainties that my\r\nLady sent down to tempt his sickly appetite.  And what must pies and beer\r\nbe to the wanderer who had eaten the crust so greedily the day before!\r\nThen, after the hour\'s rest, the hay-makers rose up to rake the hay into\r\nbeds ready for the waggons.  Harold and the stranger were raking opposite\r\nto each other, and Alfred could see them talking; and when they came into\r\nthe nearer hay-field, he saw Harold put up his hand, and point to the\r\nopen window, as if he were telling the other lad about the sick boy who\r\nwas lying there.\r\n\r\nHe was so much absorbed in thus watching, that he did not pay much heed\r\nto what interested his mother and sister--the reports which came by every\r\ncustomer about the new clergyman, who, it appeared, had been staying in\r\nthe next parish till yesterday, when he had moved into the Rectory; and\r\nMrs. Bonham, the butcher\'s wife, reported that the Rectory servants said\r\nhe was come to stay till their master came back.  All this and much more\r\nMrs. King heard and rehearsed to Ellen, while Alfred lay, sometimes\r\nreading the \'Swiss Robinson,\' sometimes watching the loading of the\r\nwains, as they creaked slowly through the fields, the horses seeming to\r\nenjoy the work, among their fragrant provender, as much as the human\r\nkind.  When five o\'clock struck, Harold gave no signs of quitting the\r\nscene of action; and Mrs. King, in much anxiety lest the letters should\r\nbe late, sent Helen to get the pony ready, while she herself went into\r\nthe field to call the boy.\r\n\r\nVery unwilling he was to come--he shook his shoulders, and growled and\r\ngrumbled, and said he should be in plenty of time, and he wished the post\r\nwas at the bottom of the sea.  Nothing but his mother\'s orders and the\r\nnecessity of the case could have made him go at all.  At last he walked\r\noff, as if he had lead in his feet, muttering that he wished he had not\r\nsome one to be always after him.  Mrs. King looked at the grimy face of\r\nhis disreputable-looking companion, and wondered whether he had put such\r\nthings into his head.\r\n\r\nVery cross was Harold as he twitched the bridle out of Ellen\'s hand,\r\nthrew the strap of the letter-bag round his neck, and gave such a\r\nre-echoing switch to the poor pony, that Alfred heard it up-stairs, and\r\nstarted up to call out, \'For shame, Harold!\'\r\n\r\nHarold was ashamed: he settled himself in the saddle and rode off, but\r\nAlfred had not the comfort of knowing that his ill-humour was not being\r\nvented upon the poor beast all the way to Elbury.  Alfred had given a\r\ngreat deal of his heart to that pony, and it made him feel helpless and\r\nindignant to think that it was ill-used.  Those tears of which he was\r\nashamed came welling up into his eyes as he lay back on his pillow; but\r\nthey were better tears than yesterday\'s--they were not selfish.\r\n\r\n\'Never mind, Alfy,\' said Ellen, \'Harold\'s not a cruel lad; he\'ll not go\r\non, if he was cross for a bit.  It is all that he\'s mad after that boy\r\nthere!  I wish mother had never let him go into the hay-field to meet bad\r\ncompany!  Depend upon it, that boy has run away out of a Reformatory!\r\nSleeping out at night!  I can\'t think how Farmer Shepherd could encourage\r\nhim among honest folk!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, now I think of it, I should not wonder if he had,\' said Mrs. King.\r\n\'He is the dirtiest boy that ever I did see!  Most likely; I wish he may\r\ndo no mischief to-night!\'\r\n\r\nHarold came home in better humour, but a fresh vexation awaited him.  Mrs.\r\nKing would not let him go to the hay-home supper in the barn.  The men\r\nwere apt to drink too much and grow riotous; and with her suspicions\r\nabout his new friend, she thought it better to keep him apart.  She was a\r\nspirited woman, who would be minded, and Harold knew he must submit, and\r\nthat he had behaved very ill.  Ellen told him too how much Alfred had\r\nbeen distressed about the pony, and though he would not shew her that he\r\ncared, it made him go straight up-stairs, and with a somewhat sheepish\r\nface, say, \'I say, Alf, the pony\'s all right.  I only gave him one cut to\r\nget him off.  He\'d never go at all if he didn\'t know his master.\'\r\n\r\n\'He\'d go fast enough for my voice,\' said Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'You know I\'d never go for to beat him,\' continued Harold; \'but it was\r\nenough to vex a chap--wasn\'t it?--to have Mother coming and lugging one\r\noff from the carrying, and away from the supper and all.  Women always\r\ngrudge one a bit of fun!\'\r\n\r\n\'Mother never grudged us cricket, nor nothing in reason,\' said Alfred.\r\n\'Lucky you that could make hay at all!  And what made you so taken up\r\nwith that new boy that Ellen runs on against, and will have it he\'s a\r\nconvict?\'\r\n\r\n\'A convict! if Ellen says that again!\' cried Harold; \'no more a convict\r\nthan she is.\'\r\n\r\n\'What is he, then?  Where does he come from?\'\r\n\r\n\'His name is Paul Blackthorn,\' said Harold; \'and he\'s the queerest chap I\r\never came across.  Why, he knew no more what to do with a prong than the\r\nfarmer\'s old sow till I shewed him.\'\r\n\r\n\'But where did he come from?\' repeated Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'He walked all the way from Piggot\'s turnpike yesterday,\' said Harold.\r\n\'He\'s looking for work.\'\r\n\r\n\'And before that?\'\r\n\r\n\'He\'d been in the Union out--oh! somewhere, I forgot where, but it\'s a\r\nname in the Postal Guide.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, but you\'ve not said who he is,\' said Ellen.\r\n\r\n\'Who? why, I tell you, he\'s Paul Blackthorn.\'\r\n\r\n\'But I suppose he had a father and mother,\' said Ellen.\r\n\r\n\'No,\' said Harold.\r\n\r\n\'No!\' Ellen and Alfred cried out together.\r\n\r\n\'Not as ever he heard tell of,\' said Harold composedly, as if this were\r\nquite natural and common.\r\n\r\n\'And you could go and be raking with him like born brothers there!\' said\r\nEllen, in horror.\r\n\r\n\'D\'ye think I\'d care for stuff like that?\' said Harold.  \'Why, he\r\nsings--he sings better than Jack Lyte!  He\'s learnt to sing, you know.\r\nAnd he\'s such a comical fellow! he said Mr. Shepherd was like a big pig\r\non his hind legs; and when Mrs. Shepherd came out to count the scraps\r\nafter we had done, what does he do but whisper to me to know how long our\r\nwithered cyder apples had come to life!\'\r\n\r\nSuch talents for amusing others evidently far out-weighed in Harold\'s\r\nconsideration such trifling points as fathers, mothers, and\r\nrespectability.  Alfred laughed; but Ellen thought it no laughing matter,\r\nand reproved Harold for being wicked enough to hear his betters made game\r\nof.\r\n\r\n\'My betters!\' said Harold--\'an old skinflint like Farmer Shepherd\'s old\r\nwoman?\'\r\n\r\n\'Hush, Harold!  I\'ll tell Mother of you, that I will!\' cried Ellen.\r\n\r\n\'Do then,\' said Harold, who knew his sister would do no such thing.  She\r\nhad made the threat too often, and then not kept her word.\r\n\r\nShe contented herself with saying, \'Well, all I know is, that I\'m sure\r\nnow he has run away out of prison, and is no better than a thief; and if\r\nour place isn\'t broken into before to-morrow morning, and Mother\'s silver\r\nsugar-tongs gone, it will be a mercy.  I\'m sure I shan\'t sleep a wink all\r\nnight.\'\r\n\r\nBoth boys laughed, and Alfred asked why he had not done it last night.\r\n\r\n\'How should I know?\' said Ellen.  \'Most likely he wanted to see the way\r\nabout the place, before he calls the rest of the gang.\'\r\n\r\n\'Take care, Harold! it\'s a gang coming now,\' said Alfred, laughing again.\r\n\'All coming on purpose to steal the sugar-tongs!\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I\'ll tell you what they are come to steal,\' said Harold\r\nmischievously; \'it\'s all for Ellen\'s fine green ivy-leaf brooch that\r\nMatilda sent her!\'\r\n\r\n\'I dare say Harold has been and told him everything valuable in the\r\nhouse!\' said Ellen.\r\n\r\n\'I think,\' said Alfred gravely, \'it would be a very odd sort of thief to\r\ncome here, when the farmer\'s ploughing cup is just by.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Harold, \'I\'d better have told him of that when I was about\r\nit; don\'t you think so, Nelly?\'\r\n\r\n\'If you go on at this rate,\' said Ellen, teased into anger, \'you\'ll be\r\nrobbing the post-office yourself some day.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ay! and I\'ll get Paul Blackthorn to help me,\' said the boy.  \'Come,\r\nEllen, don\'t be so foolish; I tell you he\'s every bit as honest as I am,\r\nI\'d go bail for him.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I _know_ he\'ll lead you to ruin!\' cried Ellen, half crying: \'a boy\r\nthat comes from nowhere and nobody knows, and sleeps on a hay-cock all\r\nnight, no better than a mere tramp!\'\r\n\r\n\'What, quarrelling here? \'said Mrs. King, coming up-stairs.  \'The lad, I\r\nwish him no ill, I\'m sure, but he\'ll be gone by to-morrow, so you may\r\nhold your tongues about him, and we\'ll read our chapter and go to bed.\'\r\n\r\nHarold\'s confidence and Ellen\'s distrust were not much wiser the one than\r\nthe other.  Which was nearest being right?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III--A NEW FRIEND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe post-office was not robbed that night, neither did the silver sugar-\r\ntongs disappear, though Paul Blackthorn was no farther off than the hay-\r\nloft at Farmer Shepherd\'s, where he had obtained leave to sleep.\r\n\r\nBut he did not go away with morning, though the hay-making was over.\r\nEllen saw him sitting perched on the empty waggon, munching his\r\nbreakfast, and to her great vexation, exchanging nods and grins when\r\nHarold rode by for the morning\'s letters; and afterwards, there was a\r\ntalk between him and the farmer, which ended in his having a hoe put into\r\nhis hand, and being next seen in the turnip-field behind the farm.\r\n\r\nTo make up for the good day, this one was a very bad one with poor\r\nAlfred.  There was thunder in the air, and if the sultry heat weighed\r\nheavily even on the healthy, no wonder it made him faint and exhausted,\r\ndisposed to self-pity, and terribly impatient and fretful.  He was\r\nprovoked by Ellen\'s moving about the room, and more provoked by Harold\'s\r\nwhistling as he cleaned out the stable; and on the other hand, Harold was\r\npetulant at being checked, and vowed there was no living in the house\r\nwith Alfred making such a work.  Moreover, Alfred was restless, and\r\nwanted something done for him every moment, interrupting Ellen\'s work,\r\nand calling his mother up from her baking so often for trifles, that she\r\nhardly knew how to get through it.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, Mr. Blunt, came, and he too felt the heat, having spent hours\r\nin going his rounds in the closeness and dust.  He was a rough man, and\r\nhis temper did not always hold out; he told Alfred sharply that he would\r\nhave no whining, and when the boy moaned and winced more than he would\r\nhave done on a good day, he punished him by not trying to be\r\ntender-handed.  When Mrs. King said, perhaps a little lengthily, how much\r\nthe boy had suffered that morning, the doctor, wearied out, no doubt,\r\nwith people\'s complaints, cut her short rather rudely, \'Ay, ay, my good\r\nwoman, I know all that.\'\r\n\r\n\'And can nothing be done, Sir, when he feels so sinking and weak?\'\r\n\r\n\'Sinking--he must feel sinking--nothing to do but to bear it,\' said Mr.\r\nBlunt gruffly, as he prepared to go.  \'Don\'t keep me now;\' and as Alfred\r\nheld up his hand, and made some complaint of the tightness of the\r\nbandage, he answered impatiently, \'I\'ve no time for that, my lad; keep\r\nstill, and be glad you\'ve nothing worse to complain of.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then you don\'t think he is getting any better, Sir?\' said Mrs. King,\r\nkeeping close to him.  \'I thought he was yesterday, and I wanted to speak\r\nto you.  My oldest daughter thought if we could get him away to the sea,\r\nand--\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s all nonsense,\' said the hurried doctor; \'don\'t you spend your\r\nmoney in that way; I tell you nothing ever will do him any good.\'\r\n\r\nThis was at the bottom of the stairs; and Mr. Blunt was off.  He was the\r\ncleverest doctor for a good way round, and it was not easy to Mrs. King\r\nto secure his attendance.  Her savings and Matilda\'s were likely to melt\r\naway sadly in paying him, since she was just too well off to be doctored\r\nat the parish expense, and he was really a good and upright man, though\r\nwanting in softness of manner when he was hurried and teased.  If Mrs.\r\nKing had known that he was in haste to get to a child with a bad burn,\r\nshe might have thought him less unkind in the short ungentle way in which\r\nhe dashed her hopes.  Alas! there had never been much hope; but she\r\nfeared that Alfred might have heard, and have been shocked.\r\n\r\nEllen heard plainly enough, and her heart sank.  She tried to look at her\r\nbrother\'s face, but he had put it out of sight, and spoke not a word; and\r\nshe only could sit wondering what was the real drift of the cruel words,\r\nand whether the doctor meant to give no hope of recovery, or only to\r\ndissuade her mother from vainly trying change of air.  Her once bright\r\nbrother always thus!  It was a sad thought, and yet she would have been\r\nglad to know he would be no worse; and Ellen\'s heart was praying with all\r\nher might that he might have his health and happiness restored to him,\r\nand that her mother might be spared this bitter sorrow.\r\n\r\nAlfred said nothing about the doctor\'s visit, but he could eat no dinner,\r\nand did not think this so much the fault of his sickly taste, as of his\r\nmother\'s potato-pie; he could not think why she should be so cross as to\r\nmake that thing, when she knew he hated it; and as to poor Harold, Alfred\r\nwould hardly let him speak or stir, without ordering Ellen down to tell\r\nhim not to make such a row.\r\n\r\nEllen was thankful when Harold was fairly hunted out of the house and\r\ngarden, even though he betook himself to the meadow, where Paul\r\nBlackthorn was lying on the grass with his feet kicking in the air, and\r\nshewing the skin through his torn shoes.  The two lads squatted down on\r\nthe grass with their heads together.  Who could tell what mischief that\r\nrunaway might be putting into Harold\'s head, and all because Alfred could\r\nnot bear with him enough for him to be happy at home?\r\n\r\nThey were so much engrossed, that it needed a rough call from the farmer\r\nto send Paul back to his work when the dinner-hour was over; whereupon\r\nHarold came slowly to his digging again.\r\n\r\nHotter and hotter did it grow, and the grey dull clouds began to gain a\r\nyellow lurid light in the distance; there were low growlings of thunder\r\nfar away, and Ellen left her work unfinished, and forgot how hot she was\r\nherself in toiling to fan Alfred, so as to keep him in some little degree\r\ncooler, while the more he strove with the heat, the more oppressed and\r\nmiserable he grew.\r\n\r\nPoor fellow! his wretchedness was not so much the heat, as the dim\r\nperception of Mr. Blunt\'s hasty words; he had not heard them fully--he\r\ndared not inquire what they had been, and he could not endure to face\r\nthem--yet the echo of \'nothing will ever do him good,\' seemed to ring\r\nlike a knell in his ears every time he turned his weary head.  Nothing do\r\nhim good!  Nothing!  Always these four walls, that little bed, this\r\nwasting weary lassitude, this gnawing, throbbing pain, no pony, no\r\nrunning, no shouting, no sense of vigour and health ever again, and\r\nperhaps--that terrible perhaps, which made Alfred\'s very flesh quail, he\r\nwould not think of; and to drive it away, he found some fresh toil to\r\nrequire of the sister who could not content him, toil as she would.\r\n\r\nSlowly the afternoon hours rolled on, one after the other, and Alfred had\r\njust been in a pet with the clock for striking four when he wanted it to\r\nbe five, when the sky grew darker, and one or two heavy drops of rain\r\ncame plashing down on the thirsty earth.\r\n\r\n\'The storm is coming at last, and now it will be cooler,\' said Ellen,\r\nlooking out from the window.  \'Dear me!\' she added, there stopping short.\r\n\r\n\'What?\' asked Alfred.  \'What are you gaping at?\'\r\n\r\n\'I declare!\' cried Ellen, \'it\'s the new clergyman!  It is Mr. Cope, and\r\nhe is coming up to the wicket!\'\r\n\r\nAlfred turned his head with a peevish sound; he was in the dreary mood to\r\nresent whatever took off attention from him for a moment.\r\n\r\n\'A very pleasant-looking gentleman,\' commented Ellen, \'and so young!  He\r\ndoes not look older than Charles Lawrence!  I wonder whether he is coming\r\nin, or if it is only to post a letter.  Oh! there he is, talking to\r\nMother!  There!\'\r\n\r\nA vivid flash of lightning came over the room at that moment and made\r\nthem all pause till it was followed up by the deep rumble of the thunder,\r\nand then down rushed the rain, plashing and leaping up again, bringing\r\nout the delicious scent from the earth, and seeming in one moment to\r\nbreathe refreshment and relief on the sick boy.  His brow was already\r\nclearing, as he listened to his mother\'s tones of welcome, as she was\r\nevidently asking the stranger to sit down and wait for the storm to be\r\nover, and the cheerful voice that replied to her.  He did not scold Ellen\r\nfor, as usual, making things neat; and whereas, five minutes sooner, he\r\nwould have hated the notion of any one coming near him, he now only hoped\r\nthat his mother would bring Mr. Cope up; and presently he heard the well-\r\nknown creak of the stairs under a manly foot, and his mother\'s voice\r\nsaying something about \'a great sufferer, Sir.\'\r\n\r\nThen came in sight his mother\'s white cap, and behind her one of the most\r\ncheerful lively faces that Alfred had ever beheld.  The new Curate looked\r\nvery little more than a boy, with a nice round fresh rosy face, and curly\r\nbrown hair, and a quick joyous eye, and regular white teeth when he\r\nsmiled that merry good-humoured smile.  Indeed, he was as young as a\r\ndeacon could be, and he looked younger.  He knocked his tall head against\r\nthe top of the low doorway as he came into the room, and answered Mrs.\r\nKing\'s apologies with a pleasant laugh.  Ellen knew her mother would like\r\nhim the better for his height, for no one since the handsome coachman\r\nhimself had had to bend his head to get into the room.  Alfred liked the\r\nlooks of him the first moment, and by way of salutation put up one of his\r\nweary, white, blue-veined hands to pull his damp forelock; but Mr. Cope,\r\nnodding in answer to Ellen\'s curtsey, took hold of his hand at once, and\r\nsoftening the cheery voice that was so pleasant to hear, said, \'Well, my\r\nboy, I hope we shall be good friends.  And what\'s your name?\'\r\n\r\n\'Alfred King, Sir,\' was the answer.  It really was quite a pleasure not\r\nto begin with the old weary subject of being pitied for his illness.\r\n\r\n\'King Alfred!\' said Mr. Cope.  \'I met King Harold yesterday.  I\'ve got\r\ninto royal company, it seems!\'\r\n\r\nAlfred smiled, it was said so drolly; but his mother, who felt a little\r\nas if she were being laughed at, said, \'Why, Sir, my brother\'s name was\r\nAlfred; and as to Harold, it was to please Miss Jane\'s little sister that\r\ndied--she was quite a little girl then, Sir, but so clever, and she would\r\nhave him named out of her History of England.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did Miss Selby give you those flowers?\' said Mr. Cope, admiring the rose\r\nand geranium in the cup on the table.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, Sir;\' and Mrs. King launched out in the praises of Miss Jane and of\r\nmy Lady, an inexhaustible subject which did not leave Alfred much time to\r\nspeak, till Mrs. King, seeing the groom from the Park coming with the\r\nletter-bag through the rain, asked Mr. Cope to excuse her, and went down-\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\n\'Well, Alfred, I think you are a lucky boy,\' he said.  \'I was comparing\r\nyou with a lad I once knew of, who got his spine injured, and is laid up\r\nin a little narrow garret, in a back street, with no one to speak to all\r\nday.  I don\'t know what he would not give for a sister, and a window like\r\nthis, and a Miss Jane.\'\r\n\r\nAlfred smiled, and said, \'Please, Sir, how old is he?\'\r\n\r\n\'About sixteen; a nice stout lad he was, as ever I knew, till his\r\naccident; I often used to meet him going about with his master, and\r\nthought it was a pleasure to meet such a good-humoured face.\'\r\n\r\nAlfred ventured to ask his trade, and was told he was being brought up to\r\nwait on his father, who was a bricklayer, but that a ladder had fallen\r\nwith him as he was going up with a heavy load, and he had been taken at\r\nonce to the hospital.  The house on which he was employed belonged to a\r\nfriend of Mr. Cope, and all in the power of this gentleman had been done\r\nfor him, but that was not much, for it was one of the families that no\r\none can serve; the father drank, and the mother was forced to be out\r\ncharing all day, and was so rough a woman, that she could hardly be much\r\ncomfort to poor Jem when she was at home.\r\n\r\nAlfred was quite taken up with the history by this time, and kept looking\r\nat Mr. Cope, as if he would eat it up with his eager eyes.  Ellen asked\r\ncompassionately who did for the poor boy all day.\r\n\r\n\'His mother runs in at dinner-time, if she is not at work too far off,\r\nand he has a jug of water and a bit of bread where he can reach them; the\r\ndoor is open generally, so that he can call to some of the other lodgers,\r\nbut though the house is as full as a bee-hive, often nobody hears him.  I\r\nbelieve his great friend is a little school-girl, who comes and sits by\r\nhim, and reads to him if she can; but she is generally at school, or else\r\nminding the children.\'\r\n\r\n\'It must be very lonely,\' said Alfred, perceiving for the first time that\r\nthere could be people worse off than himself; \'but has he no books to\r\nread?\'\r\n\r\n\'He was so irregularly sent to school, that he could not read to himself,\r\neven if his corner were not so dark, and the window so dingy.  My friend\r\ngave him a Bible, but he could not get on with it; and his mother, I am\r\nsorry to say, pawned it.\'\r\n\r\nEllen and Alfred both cried out as if they had never heard of anything so\r\nshocking.\r\n\r\n\'It was grievous,\' said Mr. Cope; \'but the poor things did not know the\r\nvalue, and when there was scarcely a morsel of bread in the house, there\r\nwas cause enough for not judging them hardly, but I don\'t think Jem would\r\nallow it now.  He got some of his little friend\'s easy Scripture lessons\r\nand the like, in large print, which he croons over as he lies there\r\nalone, till one feels sure that they are working into his heart.  The\r\npeople in the house say that though he has been ill these three years, he\r\nhas never spoken an ill-tempered word; and if any one pities him, he\r\nanswers, "It is the Lord," and seems to wish for no change.  He lies\r\nthere between dozing and dreaming and praying, and always seems content.\'\r\n\r\n\'Does he think he shall get well?\' said Alfred, who had been listening\r\nearnestly.\r\n\r\n\'Oh no; there is no chance of that; it is an injury past cure.  But I\r\nsuppose that while he bears the Will of God so patiently here, his\r\nHeavenly Father makes it up to him in peacefulness of heart now, and the\r\nhope of what is to come hereafter.\'\r\n\r\nAlfred made no answer, but his eyes shewed that he was thinking; and Mr.\r\nCope rose, and looked out of window, as a gleam of sunshine, while the\r\ndark cloud lifted up from the north-west, made the trees and fields glow\r\nwith intense green against the deep grey of the sky, darker than ever\r\nfrom the contrast.  Ellen stood up, and Alfred exclaimed, \'Oh Sir, please\r\ncome again soon!\'\r\n\r\n\'Very soon,\' said Mr. Cope good-humouredly; \'but you\'ve not got rid of me\r\nyet, the rain is pretty hard still, and I see the beggarmen dancing all\r\ndown the garden-walk.\'\r\n\r\nAlfred and Ellen smiled to hear their mother\'s old word for the drops\r\nsplashing up again; and Mr. Cope went on:\r\n\r\n\'The garden looks very much refreshed by this beautiful shower.  It is in\r\nfine order.  Is it the other monarch\'s charge?\'\r\n\r\n\'Harold\'s, Sir,\' said Ellen.  \'Yes, he takes a great pride in it, and so\r\ndid Alfred when he was well.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah, I dare say; and it must be pleasant to you to see your brother\r\nworking in it now.  I see him under that shed, and who is that lad with\r\nhim?  They seem to have some good joke together.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh,\' said Ellen, \'Harold likes company, you see, Sir, and will take up\r\nwith anybody.  I wish you could be so good as to speak to him, Sir, for\r\nlads of that age don\'t mind women folk, you see, Sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'What?  I hope his majesty does not like bad company?\' said Mr. Cope, not\r\nat all that he thought lightly of such an evil, but it was his way to\r\nspeak in that droll manner, especially as Ellen\'s voice was a little bit\r\npeevish.\r\n\r\n\'Nobody knows no harm of the chap,\' said Alfred, provoked at Ellen for\r\nwhat he thought unkindness in setting the clergyman at once on his\r\nbrother; but Ellen was the more displeased, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\'Nor nobody knows no good.  He\'s a young tramper that hired with Farmer\r\nShepherd yesterday, a regular runaway and reprobate, just out of prison,\r\nmost likely.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I hope not so bad as that,\' said Mr. Cope, \'he\'s not a bad-looking\r\nboy; but I dare say you are anxious about your brother.  It must be dull\r\nfor him, to have his companion laid up;--and by the looks of him, I dare\r\nsay his spirits are sometimes too much for you,\' he added, turning to\r\nAlfred.\r\n\r\n\'He does make a terrible racket sometimes,\' said Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'Ay, and I dare say you will try to bear with it, and not drive him out\r\nto seek dangerous company,\' said Mr. Cope; at which Alfred blushed a\r\nlittle, as he remembered the morning, and that he had never thought of\r\nthis danger.\r\n\r\nMr. Cope added, \'I think I shall go and talk to those two merry fellows;\r\nI must not tire you, my lad, but I will soon come here again;\' and he\r\ntook leave.\r\n\r\nHeartily did Ellen exclaim, \'Well, that is a nice gentleman!\' and as\r\nheartily did Alfred reply.  He felt as if a new light had come in on his\r\nlife, and Mr. Cope had not said one word about patience.\r\n\r\nEllen expected Mr. Cope to come back and warn her mother against Paul\r\nBlackthorn, but she only saw him stand talking to the two lads till he\r\nmade them both grin again, and then as the rain was over, he walked away;\r\nPaul went back to his turnips, and Harold came thundering up-stairs in\r\nhis great shoes.  Alfred was cheerful, and did not mind him now; but\r\nEllen did, and scolded him for the quantity of dirt he was bringing up\r\nwith him from the moist garden, which was all one steam of sweet smells,\r\nas the sun drew up the vapour after the rain.\r\n\r\n\'If you were coming in, you\'d better have come out of the rain, not stood\r\nidling there with that good-for-nothing lad.  The new minister said he\r\nwould be after you if you were taking up with bad company.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who told you I was with bad company?\' said Harold.\r\n\r\n\'Why, I could see it!  I hope he rebuked you both.\'\r\n\r\n\'He asked us if we could play at cricket--and he asked the pony\'s name,\'\r\nsaid Harold, \'if that\'s what you call rebuking us!\'\r\n\r\n\'And what did he say to that boy?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh! he told him he heard he was a stranger here, like himself, and asked\r\nhow long he\'d been here, and where he came from.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what did he say?\'\r\n\r\n\'He said he was from Upperscote Union--come out because he was big enough\r\nto keep himself, and come to look for work,\' said Harold.  \'He\'s a right\r\ngood chap, I\'ll tell you, and I\'ll bring him up to see Alfy one of these\r\ndays!\'\r\n\r\n\'Bring up that dirty boy!  I should like to see you!\' cried Ellen, making\r\n_such_ a face.  \'I don\'t believe a word of his coming out of the Union.\r\nI\'m sure he\'s run away out of gaol, by the look of him!\'\r\n\r\n\'Ellen--Harold--come down to your tea!\' called Mrs. King.\r\n\r\nSo they went down; and presently, while Mrs. King was gone up to give\r\nAlfred his tea, there came Mrs. Shepherd bustling across, with her black\r\nsilk apron thrown over her cap with the crimson gauze ribbons.  She\r\nwanted a bit of tape, and if there were none in the shop, Harold must\r\nmatch it in Elbury when he took the letters.\r\n\r\nEllen was rather familiar with Mrs. Shepherd, because she made her gowns,\r\nand they had some talk about the new clergyman.  Mrs. Shepherd did not\r\ncare for clergymen much; if she had done so, she might not have been so\r\nhard with her labourers.  She was always afraid of their asking her to\r\nsubscribe to something or other, so she gave it as her opinion, that she\r\nshould never think it worth while to listen to such a very young man as\r\nthat, and she hoped he would not stay; and then she said, \'So your\r\nbrother was taking up with that come-by-chance lad, I saw.  Did he make\r\nanything out of him?\'\r\n\r\n\'He fancies him more than I like, or Mother either,\' said Ellen.  \'He\r\nsays he\'s out of Upperscote Union; but he\'s a thorough impudent one, and\r\nowns he\'s no father nor mother, nor nothing belonging to him.  I think it\r\nis a deal more likely that he is run away from some reformatory, or\r\nprison.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s just what I said to the farmer!\' said Mrs. Shepherd.  \'I said he\r\nwas out of some place of that sort.  I\'m sure it\'s a sin for the\r\ngentlemen to be setting up such places, raising the county rates, and\r\npampering up a set of young rogues to let loose on us.  Ay! ay!  I\'ll\r\nwarrant he\'s a runaway thief!  I told the farmer he\'d take him to his\r\nsorrow, but you see he is short of hands just now, and the men are so set\r\nup and grabbing, I don\'t know how farmers is to live.\'\r\n\r\nSo Mrs. Shepherd went away grumbling, instead of being thankful for the\r\nbeautiful crop of hay, safely housed, before the thunder shower which had\r\nsaved the turnips from the fly.\r\n\r\nEllen might have doubted whether she had done right in helping to give\r\nthe boy a bad name, but just then in came the ostler from the Tankard\r\nwith some letters.\r\n\r\n\'Here!\' he said, \'here\'s one from one of the gentlemen lodging here\r\nfishing, to Cayenne.  You\'ll please to see how much there is to pay.\'\r\n\r\nEllen looked at her Postal Guide, but she was quite at a fault, and she\r\ncalled up-stairs to Alfred to ask if he knew where she should look for\r\nCayenne.  He was rather fond of maps, and knew a good deal of geography\r\nfor a boy of his age, but he knew nothing about this place, and she was\r\njust thinking of sending back the letter, to ask the gentleman where it\r\nwas, when a voice said:\r\n\r\n\'Try Guiana, or else South America.\'\r\n\r\nShe looked up, and there were Paul\'s dirty face and dirtier elbows,\r\nleaning over the half-door of the shop.\r\n\r\n\'Why, how do you know?\' she said, starting back.\r\n\r\n\'I learnt at school, Cayenne, capital of French Guiana.\'  Sure enough\r\nCayenne had Guiana to it in her list, and the price was found out.\r\n\r\nBut when this learned geographer advanced into the shop, and asked for a\r\nloaf, what a hand and what a sleeve did he stretch out!  Ellen scarcely\r\nliked to touch his money, and felt all her disgust revive.  But, for all\r\nthat, and for all her fear of Harold\'s running into mischief, what\r\nbusiness had she to set it about that the stranger was an escaped\r\nconvict?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Alfred had plenty of food for dreaming over his fellow\r\nsufferer.  It really seemed to quiet him to think of another in the same\r\ncase, and how many questions he longed to have asked Mr. Cope!  He wanted\r\nto know whether it came easier to Jem to be patient than to himself;\r\nwhether he suffered as much wearing pain; whether he grieved over the\r\nlast hope of using his limbs; and above all, the question he knew he\r\nnever could bear to ask, whether Jem had the dread of death to scare his\r\nthoughts, though never confessed to himself.\r\n\r\nHe longed for Mr. Cope\'s next visit, and felt strongly drawn towards that\r\nthought of Jem, yet ashamed to think of himself as so much less patient\r\nand submissive; so little able to take comfort in what seemed to soothe\r\nJem, that it was the Lord\'s doing.  Could Jem think he had been a wicked\r\nboy, and take it as punishment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV--PAUL BLACKTHORN\r\n\r\n\r\n\'I say,\' cried Harold, running up into his brother\'s room, as soon as he\r\nhad put away the pony, \'do you know whether Paul is gone?\'\r\n\r\n\'It is always Paul, Paul!\' exclaimed Ellen; \'I\'m sure I hope he is.\'\r\n\r\n\'But why do you think he would be?\' asked Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, didn\'t you hear?  He knows no more than a baby about anything, and\r\nso he turned the cows into Darnel meadow, and never put the hurdle to\r\nstop the gap--never thinking they could get down the bank; so the farmer\r\nfound them in the barley, and if he did not run out against him downright\r\nshameful--though Paul up and told him the truth, that \'twas nobody else\r\nthat did it.\'\r\n\r\n\'What, and turned him off?\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, that\'s what I want to know,\' said Harold, going on with his tea.\r\n\'Paul said to me he didn\'t know how he could stand the like of that--and\r\nyet he didn\'t like to be off--he\'d taken a fancy to the place, you see,\r\nand there\'s me, and there\'s old Caesar--and so he said he wouldn\'t go\r\nunless the farmer sent him off when he came to be paid this evening--and\r\nold Skinflint has got him so cheap, I don\'t think he will.\'\r\n\r\n\'For shame, Harold; don\'t call names!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, there he is,\' said Alfred, pointing into the farm-yard, towards\r\nthe hay-loft door.  This was over the cow-house in the gable end; and in\r\nthe dark opening sat Paul, his feet on the top step of the ladder, and\r\nCaesar, the yard-dog, lying by his side, his white paws hanging down over\r\nthe edge, his sharp white muzzle and grey prick ears turned towards his\r\nfriend, and his eyes casting such appealing looks, that he was getting\r\nmore of the hunch of bread than probably Paul could well spare.\r\n\r\n\'How has he ever got the dog up the ladder?\' cried Harold.\r\n\r\n\'Well!\' said Mrs. King, \'I declare he looks like a picture I have seen--\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, to be sure! who would go for to draw a picture of the like of\r\nthat!\' exclaimed Ellen, pausing as she put on her things to carry home\r\nsome work.\r\n\r\n\'It was a picture of a Spanish beggar-boy,\' said Mrs. King; \'and the\r\nhousekeeper at Castlefort used to say that the old lord--that\'s Lady\r\nJane\'s brother--had given six hundred pounds for it.\'\r\n\r\nEllen set out on her walk with a sound of wonder quite beyond words.  Six\r\nhundred pounds for a picture like Paul Blackthorn!  She did not know that\r\nso poor and feeble are man\'s attempts to imitate the daily forms and\r\ncolourings fresh from the Divine Hand, that a likeness of the very\r\ncommonest sight, if represented with something of its true spirit and\r\nlife, wins a strange value, especially if the work of the great master-\r\nartists of many years ago.\r\n\r\nAnd even the painter Murillo himself, though he might pleasantly recall\r\non his canvas the notion of the bright-eyed, olive-tinted lad, resting\r\nafter the toil of the day, could never have rendered the free lazy smile\r\non his face, nor the gleam of the dog\'s wistful eyes and quiver of its\r\neager ears, far less the glow of setting sunlight that shed over all that\r\nwarm, clear, ruddy light, so full of rest and cheerfulness, beautifying,\r\nas it hid, so many common things: the thatched roof of the barn, the\r\ncrested hayrick close beside it; the waggons, all red and blue, that had\r\nbrought it home, and were led to rest, the horses drooping their meek\r\nheads as they cooled their feet among the weed in the dark pond;--the\r\nducks moving, with low contented quacks and quickly-wagging tails, in one\r\nlong single file to their evening foraging in the dewy meadows; the\r\nspruce younger poultry pecking over the yard, staying up a little later\r\nthan their elders to enjoy a few leavings in peace, free from the\r\npersecutions of the cross old king of the dung-hill;--all this left in\r\nshade, while the ruddy light had mounted to the roofs, gave brilliance to\r\nevery round tuft of moss, and gleamed on the sober foliage of the old\r\nspreading walnut tree.\r\n\r\n\'Poor lad,\' said Mrs. King, \'it seems a pity he should come to such a\r\nrough life, when he seems to have got such an education!  I hope he is\r\nnot run away from anywhere.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'re as bad as Ellen, mother,\' cried Harold, \'who will have it that\r\nhe\'s out of prison.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, not that,\' said Mrs. King; \'but it did cross me whether he could\r\nhave run away from school, and if his friends were in trouble for him.\'\r\n\r\n\'He never had any friends,\' said Harold, \'nor he never ran away.  He\'s\r\nnothing but a foundling.  They picked him up under a blackthorn bush when\r\nhe was a baby, with nothing but a bit of an old plaid shawl round him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did they ever know who he belonged to?\' asked Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'Never; nor he doesn\'t care if they don\'t, for sure they could be no\r\ncredit to him; but they that found him put him into the Union, and there\r\nan old woman, that they called Granny Moll, took to him.  She had but one\r\neye, he says; but, Mother, I do believe he never had another friend like\r\nher, for he got to pulling up the bits of grass, and was near crying when\r\nhe said she was dead and gone, and then he didn\'t care for nothing.\'\r\n\r\n\'But who taught him about Cayenne?\' asked Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, that was the Union School.  All the children went to school, and\r\nthey had a terrible sharp master, who used to cut them over the head\r\nquite cruel, and was sent away at last for being such a savage; but Paul\r\nbeing always there, and having nothing else to do, you see, got on ever\r\nso far, and can work sums in his head downright wonderful.  There came an\r\ninspector once who praised him up, and said he\'d recommend him to a place\r\nwhere he\'d be taught to be a school-master, if any one would pay the\r\ncost; but the guardians wouldn\'t hear of it at no price, and were quite\r\nspiteful to find he was a good scholar, for fear, I suppose, that he\'d\r\nknow more than they.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hush, hush, Harold,\' said his mother; \'wait till you have to pay the\r\nrates before you run out against the guardians.\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you mean, Mother?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, don\'t you see, the guardians have their duties to those who pay the\r\nrates, as well as those that have parish pay.  What they have to do, is\r\nto mind that nobody starves, or the like; and their means comes out of\r\nthe rates, out of my pocket, and the like of me, as well as my Lady\'s and\r\nall the rich.  Well, whatever they might like to do, it would not be\r\nserving us fairly to take more than was a bare necessity from us, to send\r\nyour Master Paul and the like of him to a fine school.  \'Tis for them to\r\nbe just, and other folk to be generous with what\'s their own.\'\r\n\r\n\'Mother talks as if she was a guardian herself!\' said Alfred in his funny\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, the collector\'s going his rounds,\' responded Harold; and Mrs. King\r\nlaughed good-humouredly, always glad to see her sick boy able to enjoy\r\nhimself; but she sighed, saying, \'Ay, and ill can I spare it, though\r\nthanks be to God that I\'ve been as yet of them that pay, and not of them\r\nthat receive.\'\r\n\r\n\'Go on the parish!  Mother, what are you thinking of?\' cried both sons\r\nindignantly.\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. King was thinking of the long winter, and the heavy doctor\'s\r\nbill, and feeling that, after all, suffering and humbling might not be so\r\nvery far off; but she was too cheerful and full of trust to dwell on the\r\nthought, so she smiled and said, \'I only said I was thankful, boys, for\r\nthe mercy that has kept us up.  Go on now, Harold; what about the boy?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, I don\'t know that he\'d have gone if they had paid his expenses ever\r\nso much,\' said Harold, \'for he\'s got a great spirit of his own, and\r\nwouldn\'t be beholden to any one, he said, now he could keep himself--he\'d\r\nhad quite enough of the parish and its keep; so he said he\'d go on the\r\ntramp till he got work; and they let him out of the Union with just the\r\nclothes to his back, and a shilling in his pocket.  \'Twas the first time\r\nhe had ever been let out of bounds since he was picked up under the tree;\r\nand he said no one ever would guess the pleasure it was to have nobody to\r\norder him here and there, and no bounds round him; and he quite hated the\r\nnotion of getting inside walls again, as if it was a prison.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I know!  I can fancy that!\' cried Alfred, raising himself and\r\npanting; \'and where did he go first?\'\r\n\r\n\'First, he only wanted to get as far from Upperscote as ever he could, so\r\nhe walked on; I can\'t say how he lived, but he didn\'t beg; he got a job\r\nhere and a job there; but there are not so many things he knows the knack\r\nof, having been at school all his life.  Once he took up with a man that\r\nsold salt, to draw his cart for him, but the man swore at him so awfully\r\nhe could not bear it, and beat him too, so he left him, and he had lived\r\nterrible hard for about a month before he came here!  So you see, Mother,\r\nthere\'s not one bit of harm in him; he\'s a right good scholar, and never\r\nsays a bad word, nor has no love for drink; so you won\'t be like Ellen,\r\nand be always at me for going near him?\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'re getting a big boy, Harold, and it is lonely for you,\' said Mrs.\r\nKing reluctantly; \'and if the lad is a good lad I\'d not cast up his\r\nmisfortune against him; but I must say, I should think better of him if\r\nhe would keep himself a little bit cleaner and more decent, so as he\r\ncould go to church.\'\r\n\r\nHarold made a very queer face, and said, \'How is he to do it up in the\r\nhay-loft, Mother? and he ha\'n\'t got enough to pay for lodgings, nor for\r\nwashing, nor to change.\'\r\n\r\n\'The river is cheap enough,\' said Alfred.  \'Do you remember when we used\r\nto bathe together, Harold, and go after the minnows?\'\r\n\r\n\'Ay, but he don\'t know how; and then they did plague him so in the Union,\r\nthat he\'s got to hate the very name of washing--scrubbing them over and\r\ncutting their hair as if they were in gaol.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor boy! he is terribly forsaken,\' said Mrs. King compassionately.\r\n\r\n\'You may say that!\' returned Harold; \'why, he\'s never so much as seen how\r\nfolks live at home, and wanted to know if you were most like old Moll or\r\nthe master of the Union!\'\r\n\r\nAlfred went into such a fit of laughter as almost hurt him; but Mrs. King\r\nfelt the more pitiful and tender towards the poor deserted orphan, who\r\ncould not even understand what a mother was like, and the tears came into\r\nher eyes, as she said, \'Well, I\'m glad he\'s not a bad boy.  I hope he\r\nthinks of the Father and the Home that he has above.  I say, Harold,\r\nagainst next Sunday I\'ll look out Alfred\'s oldest shirt for him to put\r\non, and you might bring me his to wash, only mind you soak it well in the\r\nriver first.\'\r\n\r\nHarold quite flushed with gratitude for his mother\'s kindness, for he\r\nknew it was no small effort in one so scrupulously and delicately clean,\r\nand with so much work on her hands; but Mrs. King was one who did her\r\nalms by her trouble when she had nothing else to give.  Alfred smiled and\r\nsaid he wondered what Ellen would say; and almost at the same moment\r\nHarold shot down-stairs, and was presently seen standing upon Paul\'s\r\nladder talking to him; then Paul rose up as though to come down, and\r\nthere was much fun going on, as to how Caesar was to be got down; for, as\r\nevery one knows, a dog can mount a ladder far better than he can descend;\r\nand poor Caesar stretched out his white paw, looked down, seemed to turn\r\ngiddy, whined, and looked earnestly at his friends till they took pity on\r\nhim and lifted him down between them, stretching out his legs to their\r\nfull length, like a live hand-barrow.\r\n\r\nA few seconds more, and there was a great trampling of feet, and then in\r\nwalked Harold, exclaiming, \'Here he is!\'  And there he stood, shy and\r\nsheepish, with rusty black shag by way of hair, keen dark beads of eyes,\r\nand very white teeth; but all the rest, face, hands, jacket, trousers,\r\nshoes, and all, of darker or lighter shades of olive-brown; and as to the\r\nrents, one would be sorry to have to count them; mending them would have\r\nbeen a thing impossible.  What a difference from the pure whiteness of\r\neverything around Alfred! the soft pink of the flush of surprise on his\r\ndelicate cheek, and the wavy shine on his light hair.  A few months ago,\r\nAlfred would have been as ready as his brother to take that sturdy hand,\r\nmarbled as it was with dirt, and would have heeded all drawbacks quite as\r\nlittle; but sickness had changed him much, and Paul was hardly beside his\r\ncouch before the colour fleeted away from his cheek, and his eye turned\r\nto his mother in such distress, that she was obliged to make a sign to\r\nHarold in such haste that it looked like anger, and to mutter something\r\nabout his being taken worse.  And while she was holding the smelling\r\nsalts to him, and sprinkling vinegar over his couch, they heard the two\r\nboys\' voices loud under the window, Paul saying he should never come\r\nthere again, and Harold something about people being squeamish and fine.\r\n\r\nIt hurt Alfred, and he burst out, almost crying, \'Mother!  Mother, now\r\nisn\'t that too bad!\'\r\n\r\n\'It is very thoughtless,\' said Mrs. King sorrowfully; \'but you know\r\neverybody has their feelings, Alfred, and I am sorry it happened so.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure I couldn\'t help it,\' said Alfred, as if his mother were turning\r\nagainst him.  \'Harold had better have brought up the farmer\'s whole\r\nstable at once!\'\r\n\r\n\'When you were well, you did not think of such things any more than he\r\ndoes.\'\r\n\r\nAlfred grunted.  He could not believe that; and he did not feel gently\r\nwhen his brother shewed any want of consideration; but his mother thought\r\nhe would only grow crosser by dwelling on the unlucky subject, so she\r\nadvised him to lie still and rest before his being moved to bed, and went\r\ndown herself to finish some ironing.\r\n\r\nPresently Alfred saw the Curate coming over the bridge with quick long\r\nsteps, and this brought to his mind that he had been wishing to hear more\r\nof the poor crippled boy.  He watched eagerly, and was pleased to see Mr.\r\nCope turn in at the wicket, and presently the tread upon the stairs was\r\nheard, and the high head was lowered at the door.\r\n\r\n\'Good evening, Alfred; your mother told me it would not disturb you if I\r\ncame up alone;\' and he began to inquire into his amusements and\r\noccupations, till Alfred became quite at home with him, and at ease, and\r\nventured to ask, \'If you please, Sir, do you ever hear about Jem now?\'\r\nand as Mr. Cope looked puzzled, \'the boy you told me of, Sir, that fell\r\noff the scaffold.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, the boy at Liverpool!  No, I only saw him once when I was staying\r\nwith my cousin; but I will ask after him if you wish to hear.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, Sir.  I wanted to know if he had been a bad boy.\'\r\n\r\n\'That I cannot tell.  Why do you wish to know?  Was it because he had\r\nsuch an affliction?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, Sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t think that is quite the way to look at troubles,\' said Mr. Cope.\r\n\'I should think his accident had been a great blessing to him, if it took\r\nhim out of temptation, and led him to think more of God.\'\r\n\r\n\'But isn\'t it punishment?\' said Alfred, not able to get any farther; but\r\nMr. Cope felt that he was thinking of himself more than of Jem.\r\n\r\n\'All our sufferings in this life come as punishment of sin,\' he said.  \'If\r\nthere had been no sin, there would have been no pain; and whatever we\r\nhave to bear in this life is no more than is our due, whatever it may\r\nbe.\'\r\n\r\n\'Every one is sinful,\' said Alfred slowly; \'but why have some more to\r\nbear than others that may be much worse?\'\r\n\r\n\'Did you never think it hard to be kept strictly, and punished by your\r\ngood mother?\'\r\n\r\nAlfred answered rather fretfully, \'But if it is good to be punished, why\r\nain\'t all alike?\'\r\n\r\n\'God in His infinite wisdom sees the treatment that each particular\r\nnature needs.  Some can be better trained by joy, and some by grief; some\r\nmay be more likely to come right by being left in active health; others,\r\nby being laid low, and having their faults brought to mind.\'\r\n\r\nAlfred did not quite choose to take this in, and his answer was half\r\nsulky:\r\n\r\n\'Bad boys are quite well!\'\r\n\r\n\'And a reckoning will be asked of them.  Do not think of other boys.\r\nThink over your past life, of which I know nothing, and see whether you\r\ncan believe, after real looking into it, that you have done nothing to\r\ndeserve God\'s displeasure.  There are other more comforting ways of\r\nbringing joy out of pain; but of this I am sure, that none will come home\r\nto us till we own from the bottom of our heart, that whatever we suffer\r\nin this life, we suffer most justly for the punishment of our sins.  God\r\nbless and help you, my poor boy.  Good night.\'\r\n\r\nWith these words he went down-stairs, for well he knew that while Alfred\r\nwent on to justify himself, no peace nor joy could come to him, and he\r\nthought it best to leave the words to work in, praying in his heart that\r\nthey might do so, and help the boy to humility and submission.\r\n\r\nFinding Mrs. King in her kitchen, he paused and said, \'We shall have a\r\nConfirmation in the spring, Mrs. King; shall not you have some candidates\r\nfor me?\'\r\n\r\n\'My daughter will be very glad, thank you, Sir; she is near to seventeen,\r\nand a very good girl to me.  And Harold, he is but fourteen--would he be\r\nold enough, Sir?\'\r\n\r\n\'I believe the Bishop accepts boys as young; and he might be started in\r\nlife before another opportunity.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, Sir, he shall come to you, and I hope you won\'t think him too idle\r\nand thoughtless.  He\'s a good-hearted boy, Sir; but it is a charge when a\r\nlad has no father to check him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed it is, Mrs. King; but I think you must have done your best.\'\r\n\r\n\'I hope I have, Sir,\' she said sadly; \'I\'ve tried, but my ability is not\r\nmuch, and he is a lively lad, and I\'m sometimes afraid to be too strict\r\nwith him.\'\r\n\r\n\'If you have taught him to keep himself in order, that\'s the great thing,\r\nMrs. King; if he has sound principles, and honours you, I would hope much\r\nfor him.\'\r\n\r\n\'And, Sir, that boy he has taken a fancy to; he is a poor lost lad who\r\nnever had a home, but Harold says he has been well taught, and he might\r\ntake heed to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, Mrs. King; I will certainly try to speak to him.  You said\r\nnothing of Alfred; do you think he will not be well enough?\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!  Sir,\' she said in her low subdued voice, \'my mind misgives me that\r\nit is not for Confirmation that you will be preparing him.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Cope started.  He had seen little of illness, and had not thought of\r\nthis.  \'Indeed! does the doctor think so ill of him?  Do not these cases\r\noften partially recover?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know, Sir; Mr. Blunt does not give much account of him,\' and her\r\nvoice grew lower and lower; \'I\'ve seen that look in his father\'s and his\r\nbrother\'s face.\'\r\n\r\nShe hid her face in her handkerchief as if overpowered, but looked up\r\nwith the meek look of resignation, as Mr. Cope said in a broken voice, \'I\r\nhad not expected--you had been much tried.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, Sir.  The Will of the Lord be done,\' she said, as if willing to\r\nturn aside from the dark side of the sorrow that lay in wait for her;\r\n\'but I\'m thankful you are come to help my poor boy now--he frets over his\r\ntrouble, as is natural, and I\'m afraid he should offend, and I\'m no\r\nscholar to know how to help him.\'\r\n\r\n\'You can help him by what is better than scholarship,\' said Mr. Cope; and\r\nhe shook her hand warmly, and went away, feeling what a difference there\r\nwas in the ways of meeting affliction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V--AN UNWELCOME VISITOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\'The axe is laid to the root of the tree,\' was said by the Great\r\nMessenger, when the new and better Covenant was coming to pierce, try,\r\nand search into, the hearts of men.\r\n\r\nSomething like this always happens, in some measure, whenever closer,\r\nclearer, and more stringent views of faith and of practice are brought\r\nhome to Christians.  They do not always take well the finding that more\r\nis required of them than they have hitherto fancied needful; and there\r\nare many who wince and murmur at the sharp piercing of the weapon which\r\ntries their very hearts; they try to escape from it, and to forget the\r\ndisease that it has touched, and at first, often grow worse rather than\r\nbetter.  Well is it for them if they return while yet there is time,\r\nbefore blindness have come over their eyes, and hardness over their\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this was the true history of much that grieved poor Mrs. King,\r\nand distressed Ellen, during the remainder of the summer.  Anxious as\r\nMrs. King had been to bring her sons up in the right way, there was\r\nsomething in Mr. Cope\'s manner of talking to them that brought things\r\ncloser home to them, partly from their being put in a new light, and\r\npartly from his being a man, and speaking with a different kind of\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nAlfred did not like his last conversation--it was little more than his\r\nmother and Miss Selby had said--but then he had managed to throw it off,\r\nand he wanted to do so again.  It was pleasanter to him to think himself\r\nhardly treated, than to look right in the face at all his faults; he knew\r\nit was of no use to say he had none, so he lumped them all up by calling\r\nhimself a sinful creature, like every one else; and thus never felt the\r\nweight of them at all, because he never thought what they were.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, because Mr. Cope\'s words had made him uneasy, he could not rest\r\nin this state; he was out of temper whenever the Curate\'s name was\r\nspoken, and accused Ellen of bothering about him as much as Harold did\r\nabout Paul Blackthorn; and if he came to see him, he made himself sullen,\r\nand would not talk, sometimes seeming oppressed and tired, and unable to\r\nbear any one\'s presence, sometimes leaving Ellen to do all the answering,\r\ndreading nothing so much as being left alone with the clergyman.  Mr.\r\nCope had offered to read prayers with him, and he could not refuse; but\r\nhe was more apt to be thinking that it was tiresome, than trying to enter\r\ninto what, poor foolish boy, would have been his best comfort.\r\n\r\nTo say he was cross when Mr. Cope was there, would be saying much too\r\nlittle; there was scarcely any time when he was not cross; he was hardly\r\ncivil even to Miss Jane, so that she began to think it was unpleasant to\r\nhim to have her there; and if she were a week without calling, he\r\ngrumbled hard thoughts about fine people; he was fretful and impatient\r\nwith the doctor; and as to those of whom he had no fears, he would have\r\nbeen quite intolerable, had they loved him less, or had less pity on his\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nHe never was pleased with anything; teased his mother half the night, and\r\ndrove Ellen about all day.  She, good girl, never said one word of\r\nimpatience, but bore it all with the sweetest good humour; but her mother\r\nnow and then spoke severely for Alfred\'s own good, and then he made\r\nhimself more miserable than ever, and thought she was unkind and harsh,\r\nand that he was very much to be pitied for having a mother who could not\r\nbear with her poor sick boy.  He was treating his mother as he was\r\ntreating his Father in Heaven.\r\n\r\nHow Harold fared with him may easily be guessed--how the poor boy could\r\nhardly speak or step without being moaned at, till he was almost turned\r\nout of his own house; and his mother did not know what to do, for Alfred\r\nwas really very ill, and fretting made him worse, and nothing could be so\r\nbad for his brother as being driven out from home, to spend the long\r\nsummer evenings as he could.\r\n\r\nEllen would have been thankful now, had Paul Blackthorn been the worst\r\ncompany into which Harold fell.  Not that Paul was a bit cleaner; on the\r\ncontrary, each day could not fail to make him worse, till, as Ellen had\r\nonce said, you might almost grow a crop of radishes upon his shoulders.\r\n\r\nMrs. King\'s kind offer of washing his shirt had come to nothing.  She\r\nasked Harold about it, and had for answer, \'Do you think he would, after\r\nthe way you served him?\'\r\n\r\nEither he was affronted, or he was ashamed of her seeing his rags, or,\r\nwhat was not quite impossible, there was no shirt at all in the case; and\r\nhe had a sturdy sort of independence about him, that made him always turn\r\nsurly at any notion of anything being done for him for charity.\r\n\r\nHow or why he stayed on with the farmer was hard to guess, for he had\r\nvery scanty pay, and rough usage; the farmer did not like him; the\r\nfarmer\'s wife scolded him constantly, and laid on his shoulders all the\r\nmischief that was done about the place; and the shuffler gave him half\r\nhis own work to do, and hunted him about from dawn till past sunset.  He\r\nwas always going at the end of every week, but never gone; perhaps he had\r\nundergone too much in his wanderings, to be ready to begin them again; or\r\nperhaps either Caesar or Harold, one or both, kept him at Friarswood.  And\r\nthere might be another reason, too, for no one had ever spoken to him\r\nlike Mr. Cope.  Very few had ever thrown him a kindly word, or seemed to\r\ntreat him like a thing with feelings, and those few had been rough and\r\nunmannerly; but Mr. Cope\'s good-natured smile and pleasant manner had\r\nbeen a very different thing; and perhaps Paul promised to come to the\r\nConfirmation class, chiefly because of the friendly tone in which he was\r\ninvited.\r\n\r\nWhen there, he really liked it.  He had always liked what he was taught,\r\napart from the manner of teaching; and now both manner and lessons were\r\ndelightful to him.  His answers were admirable, and it was not all head\r\nknowledge, for very little more than a really kind way of putting it was\r\nneeded, to make him turn in his loneliness to rest in the thought of the\r\never-present Father.  Hard as the discipline of his workhouse home had\r\nbeen, it had kept him from much outward harm; the little he had seen in\r\nhis wanderings had shocked him, and he was more untaught in evil than\r\nmany lads who thought themselves more respectable, so there was no habit\r\nof wickedness to harden and blunt him; and the application of all he had\r\nlearnt before, found his heart ready.\r\n\r\nHe had not gone to church since he left the workhouse: he did not think\r\nit belonged to vagabonds like him; besides, he always felt walls like a\r\nprison; and he had not profited much by the workhouse prayers, which were\r\nread on week-days by the master, and on Sundays by a chaplain, who always\r\nhad more to do than he could manage, and only went to the paupers when\r\nthey were very ill.  But when Mr. Cope talked to him of the duty of going\r\nto church, he said, \'I will, Sir;\' and he sat in the gallery with the\r\nyoung lads, who were not quite as delicate as Alfred.\r\n\r\nThe service seemed to rest him, and to be like being brought near a\r\nfriend; and he had been told that church might always be his home.  He\r\ntook a pleasure in going thither--the more, perhaps, that he rather liked\r\nto shew how little he cared for remarks upon his appearance.  There was a\r\ngreat deal of independence about him; and, having escaped from the\r\nunloving maintenance of the parish, while he had as yet been untaught\r\nwhat affection or gratitude meant, he _would_ not be beholden to any one.\r\n\r\nScanty as were his wages, he would accept nothing from anybody; he daily\r\nbought his portion of bread from Mrs. King, but it was of no use for her\r\nto add a bit of cheese or bacon to it; he never would see the relish, and\r\nleft it behind; and so he never would accept Mr. Cope\'s kind offers of\r\ngiving him a bit of supper in his kitchen, perhaps because he was afraid\r\nof being said to go to the Rectory for the sake of what he could get.\r\n\r\nHe did not object to the farmer\'s beer, which was sometimes given him\r\nwhen any unusual extra work had been put on him.  That was his right, for\r\nin truth the farmer did not pay him the value of his labour, and perhaps\r\ndisliked him the more, because of knowing in his conscience that this was\r\nshameful extortion.\r\n\r\nHowever, just at harvest time, when Paul\'s shoes had become very like\r\nwhat may be sometimes picked up by the roadside, Mr. Shepherd did\r\nactually bestow on him a pair that did not fit himself!  Harold came home\r\nquite proud of them.\r\n\r\nHowever, on the third day they were gone, and the farmer\'s voice was\r\nheard on the bridge, rating Paul violently for having changed them away\r\nfor drink.\r\n\r\nMrs. King felt sorrowful; but, as Ellen said, \'What could you expect of\r\nhim?\'  In spite of the affront, there was a sort of acquaintance now over\r\nthe counter between Mrs. King and young Blackthorn; and when he came for\r\nhis bread, she could not help saying, \'I\'m sorry to see you in those\r\nagain.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, the others hurt me so, I could hardly get about,\' said Paul.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! poor lad, I suppose your feet has got spread with wearing those old\r\nones; but you should try to use yourself to decent ones, or you\'ll soon\r\nbe barefoot; and I do think it was a pity to drink them up.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s all the farmer, Ma\'am.  He thinks one can\'t do anything but\r\ndrink.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, what is become of them?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, you see, Ma\'am, they just suited Dick Royston, and he wanted a pair\r\nof shoes, and I wanted a Bible and Prayer-book, so we changed \'em.\'\r\n\r\nWhen Ellen heard this, she could not help owning that Paul was a good boy\r\nafter all, though it was in an odd sort of way.  But, alas! when next he\r\nwas to go to Mr. Cope, there was a hue-and-cry all over the hay-loft for\r\nthe Prayer-book.  There was no place to put it safely, or if there had\r\nbeen, Poor Paul was too great a sloven to think of any such thing; and as\r\nit was in a somewhat rubbishy state to begin with, it was most likely\r\nthat one of the cows had eaten it with her hay; and all that could be\r\nsaid was, that it would have been worse if it had been the Bible.\r\n\r\nAs to Dick Royston, to find that he would change away his Bible for a\r\npair of shoes, made Mrs. King doubly concerned that he should be a good\r\ndeal thrown in Harold\'s way.  There are many people who neglect their\r\nBibles, and do not read them; but this may be from thoughtlessness or\r\npress of care, and is not like the wilful breaking with good, that it is\r\nto part with the Holy Scripture, save under the most dire necessity; and\r\nDick was far from being in real want, nor was he ignorant, like Mr.\r\nCope\'s poor Jem, for he had been to school, and could read well; but he\r\nwas one of those many lads, who, alas! are everywhere to be found, who\r\nbreak loose from all restraint as soon as they can maintain themselves.\r\nThey do their work pretty well, and are tolerably honest; but for the\r\nrest--alas! they seem to live without God.  Prayers and Church they have\r\nleft behind, as belonging to school-days; and in all their strength and\r\nhealth, their days of toil, their evenings of rude diversion, their\r\nSundays of morning sleep, noonday basking in the sun, evening cricket,\r\nthey have little more notion of anything concerning their souls than the\r\nhorses they drive.  If ever a fear comes over them, it seems a long long\r\nway off, a whole life-time before them; they are awkward, and in dread of\r\none another\'s jeers and remarks; and if they ever wish to be better, they\r\ncast it from them by fancying that time must steady them when they have\r\nhad their bit of fun, or that something will come from somewhere to\r\nchange them all at once, and make it easy to them to be good--as if they\r\nwere not making it harder each moment.\r\n\r\nThis sort of lad had been utterly let alone till Mr. Cope came; and Lady\r\nJane and the school-master felt it was dreary work to train up nice lads\r\nin the school, only to see them run riot, and forget all good as soon as\r\nthey thought themselves their own masters.\r\n\r\nMr. Cope was anxious to do the best he could for them, and the\r\nConfirmation made a good opportunity; but the boys did not like to be\r\ninterfered with--it made them shy to be spoken to; and they liked\r\nlounging about much better than having to poke into that mind of theirs,\r\nwhich they carried somewhere about them, but did not like to stir up.\r\nThey had no notion of going to school again--which no one wanted them to\r\ndo--nor to church, because it was like little boys; and they wouldn\'t be\r\nobliged.\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Cope made little way with them; a few who had better parents came\r\nregularly to him, but others went off when they found it too much\r\ntrouble, and behaved worse than ever by way of shewing they did not care.\r\nThis folly had in some degree taken possession of Harold; and though he\r\ncould not be as bad as were some of the others, he was fast growing\r\nimpatient of restraint, and worried and angry, as if any word of good\r\nadvice affronted him.  Driven from home by the fear of disturbing Alfred,\r\nhe was left the more to the company of boys who made him ashamed of being\r\nordered by his mother; and there was a jaunty careless style about all\r\nhis ways of talking and moving, that shewed there was something wrong\r\nabout him--he scorned Ellen, and was as saucy as he dared even to his\r\nmother; and though Mr. Cope found him better instructed than most of his\r\nscholars, he saw him quite as idle, as restless at church, and as ready\r\nto whisper and grin at improper times, as many who had never been trained\r\nlike him.\r\n\r\nOne August Sunday afternoon, Mrs. King was with Alfred while Ellen was at\r\nchurch.  He was lying on his couch, very uncomfortable and fretful, when\r\nto the surprise of both, a knock was heard at the door.  Mrs. King looked\r\nout of the window, and a smart, hard-looking, pigeon\'s-neck silk bonnet\r\nat once nodded to her, and a voice said, \'I\'ve come over to see you,\r\nCousin King, if you\'ll come down and let me in.  I knew I should find you\r\nat home.\'\r\n\r\n\'Betsey Hardman!\' exclaimed Alfred, in dismay; \'you won\'t let her come up\r\nhere, Mother?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not if I can help it,\' said Mrs. King, sighing.  If there were a thing\r\nshe disliked above all others, it was Sunday visiting.\r\n\r\n\'You must help it, Mother,\' said Alfred, in his most pettish tones.  \'I\r\nwon\'t have her here, worrying with her voice like a hen cackling.  Say\r\nyou won\'t let her come her!\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well,\' said Mrs. King, in doubt of her own powers, and in haste to\r\nbe decently civil.\r\n\r\n\'Say you won\'t,\' repeated Alfred.  \'Gadding about of a Sunday, and\r\nleaving her old sick mother--more shame for her!  Promise, Mother!\'\r\n\r\nHe had nearly begun to cry at his mother\'s unkindness in running down-\r\nstairs without making the promise, for, in fact, Mrs. King had too much\r\nconscience to gain present quiet for any one by promises she might be\r\nforced to break; and Betsey Hardman was only too well known.\r\n\r\nHer mother was an aunt of Alfred\'s father, an old decrepit widow, nearly\r\nbed-ridden, but pretty well to do, by being maintained chiefly by her\r\ndaughter, who made a good thing of taking in washing in the suburbs of\r\nElbury, and always had a girl or two under her.  She had neither had the\r\neducation, nor the good training in service, that had fallen to Mrs.\r\nKing\'s lot; and her way of life did not lead to softening her tongue or\r\ntemper.  Ellen called her vulgar, and though that is not a nice word to\r\nuse, she was coarse in her ways of talking and thinking, loud-voiced, and\r\nunmannerly, although meaning to be very good-natured.\r\n\r\nAlfred lay in fear of her step, ten times harder than Harold\'s in his\r\nmost boisterous mood, coming clamp clamp! up the stairs; and her shrill\r\nvoice--the same tone in which she bawled to her deaf mother, and hallooed\r\nto her girls when they were hanging out the clothes in the high\r\nwind--coming pitying him--ay, and perhaps her whole weight lumbering down\r\non the couch beside him, shaking every joint in his body!  His mother\'s\r\nways, learnt in the Selby nursery, had made him more tender, and more\r\neasily fretted by such things, than most cottage lads, who would have\r\nbeen used to them, and never have thought of not liking to have every\r\nneighbour who chose running up into the room, and talking without regard\r\nto subject or tone.\r\n\r\nHe listened in a fright to the latch of the door, and the coming in.\r\nBetsey\'s voice came up, through every chink of the boards, whatever she\r\ndid herself; and he could hear every word of her greeting, as she said\r\nhow it was such a fine day, she said to Mother she would take a holiday,\r\nand come and see Cousin King and the poor lad: it must be mighty dull for\r\nhim, moped up there.\r\n\r\nStump! stump!  Was she coming?  His mother was answering something too\r\nsoft for him to hear.\r\n\r\n\'What, is he asleep?\'\r\n\r\n\'O Mother, must you speak the truth?\'\r\n\r\n\'Bless me!  I should have thought a little cheerful company was good for\r\nhim.  Do you leave him quite alone?  Well--\' and there was a frightful\r\nnoise of the foot of the heaviest chair on the floor.  \'I\'ll sit down and\r\nwait a bit!  Is he so very fractious, then?\'\r\n\r\nWhat was his mother saying?  Alfred clenched his fist, and grinned anger\r\nat Betsey with closed teeth.  There was the tiresome old word, \'Low--ay,\r\nso\'s my mother; but you should rise his spirits with company, you see;\r\nthat\'s why I came over; as soon as ever I heard that there wasn\'t no hope\r\nof him, says I to Mother--\'\r\n\r\nWhat?  What was that she had heard?  There was his mother, probably\r\ntrying to restrain her voice, for it came up now just loud enough to make\r\nit most distressing to try to catch the words, which sounded like\r\nsomething pitying.  \'Ay, ay--just like his poor father; when they be\r\ndecliny, it will come out one ways or another; and says I to Mother, I\'ll\r\ngo over and cheer poor Cousin King up a bit, for you see, after all, if\r\nhe\'d lived, he\'d be nothing but a burden, crippled up like that; and a\r\nlingering job is always bad for poor folks.\'\r\n\r\nAlfred leant upon his elbow, his eyes full stretched, but feeling as if\r\nall his senses had gone into his ears, in his agony to hear more; and he\r\neven seemed to catch his mother\'s voice, but there was no hope in that;\r\nit was of her knowing it would be all for the best; and the sadness of it\r\ntold him that she believed the same as Betsey.  Then came, \'Yes; I\r\ndeclare it gave me such a turn, you might have knocked me down with a\r\nfeather.  I asked Mr. Blunt to come in and see what\'s good for Mother,\r\nshe feels so weak at times, and has such a noise in her head, just like\r\nthe regiment playing drums, she says, till she can\'t hardly bear herself;\r\nand so what do you think he says?  Don\'t wrap up her head so warm, says\r\nhe--a pretty thing for a doctor to say, as if a poor old creature like\r\nthat, past seventy years old, could go without a bit of flannel to her\r\nhead, and her three night-caps, and a shawl over them when there\'s a\r\ndraught.  I say, Cousin, I ha\'n\'t got much opinion of Mr. Blunt.  Why\r\ndon\'t you get some of them boxes of pills, that does cures wonderful?\r\nEver so many lords and ladies cured of a perplexity fit, by only just\r\ntaking an imposing draught or two.\'\r\n\r\nAnother time Alfred would have laughed at the very imposing draught, that\r\nwas said to cure lords and ladies of this jumble between apoplexy and\r\nparalysis; but this was no moment for laughing, and he was in despair at\r\nfancying his mother wanted to lead her off on the quack medicine; but she\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\n\'Well, only read the papers that come with them.  I make my girl Sally\r\nread \'em all to me, being that she\'s a better scholar; and the long words\r\nis quite heavenly--I declare there ain\'t one of them shorter than\r\nperegrination.  I\'d have brought one of them over to shew you if I hadn\'t\r\ncome away in a hurry, because Evans\'s cart was going out to the merry\r\norchard, and says I to Mother, Well, I\'ll get a lift now there\'s such a\r\nchance to Friarswood: it\'ll do them all a bit of good to see a bit of\r\ncheerful company, seeing, as Mr. Blunt says, that poor lad is going after\r\nhis father as fast as can be.  Dear me, says I, you don\'t say so, such a\r\nfine healthy-looking chap as he was.  Yes, he says, but it\'s in the\r\nconstitution; it\'s getting to the lungs, and he\'ll never last out the\r\nwinter.\'\r\n\r\nAlfred listened for the tone of his mother\'s voice; he knew he should\r\njudge by that, even without catching the words--low, subdued, sad--he\r\nalmost thought she began with \'Yes.\'\r\n\r\nAll the rest that he heard passed by him merely as a sound, noted no more\r\nthan the lowing of the cattle, or the drone of the thrashing machine.  He\r\nlay half lifted up on his pillows, drawing his breath short with\r\napprehension; his days were numbered, and death was coming fast, fast,\r\nstraight upon him.  He felt it within himself--he knew now the meaning of\r\nthe pain and sinking, the shortness of breath and choking of throat that\r\nhad been growing on him through the long summer days; he was being \'cut\r\noff with pining sickness,\' and his sentence had gone forth.  He would\r\nhave screamed for his mother in the sore terror and agony that had come\r\nover him, in hopes she might drive the notion from him; but the dread of\r\nseeing her followed by that woman kept his lips shut, except for his long\r\ngasps of breath.\r\n\r\nAnd she could not keep him--Mr. Blunt could not keep him; no one could\r\nstay the hand that had touched him!  Prayer!  They had prayed for his\r\nfather, for Charlie, but it had not been God\'s Will.  He had himself many\r\ntimes prayed to recover, and it had not been granted--he was worse and\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nMoreover, whither did that path of suffering lead?  Up rose before Alfred\r\nthe thought of living after the unknown passage, and of answering for all\r\nhe had done; and now the faults he had refused to call to mind when he\r\nwas told of chastisement, came and stood up of themselves.  Bred up to\r\nknow the good, he had not loved it; he had cared for his own pleasure,\r\nnot for God; he had not heeded the comfort of his widowed mother; he had\r\nbeen careless of the honour of God\'s House, said and heard prayers\r\nwithout minding them; he had been disrespectful and ill-behaved at my\r\nLady\'s--he had been bad in every way; and when illness came, how\r\nrebellious and murmuring he had been, how unkind he had been to his\r\npatient mother, sister, and brother; and when Mr. Cope had told him it\r\nwas meant to lead him to repent, he would not hear; and now it was too\r\nlate, the door would be shut.  He had always heard that there was a time\r\nwhen sorrow was no use, when the offer of being saved had been thrown\r\naway.\r\n\r\nWhen Ellen came in, and after a short greeting to Betsey Hardman, went up-\r\nstairs, she found Alfred lying back on his pillow, deadly white, the\r\nbeads of dew standing on his brow, and his breath in gasps.  She would\r\nhave shrieked for her mother, but he held out his hand, and said, in a\r\nlow hoarse whisper, \'Ellen, is it true?\'\r\n\r\n\'What, Alfy dear?  What is the matter?\'\r\n\r\n\'What _she_ says.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who?  Betsey Hardman?  Dear dear Alf, is it anything dreadful?\'\r\n\r\n\'That I shall die,\' said Alfred, his eyes growing round with terror\r\nagain.  \'That Mr. Blunt said I couldn\'t last out the winter.\'\r\n\r\n\'Dear Alfy, don\'t!\' cried Ellen, throwing her arms round him, and kissing\r\nhim with all her might; \'don\'t fancy it!  She\'s always gossiping and\r\ngadding about, and don\'t know what she says, and she\'d got no business to\r\ntell stories to frighten my darling!\' she exclaimed, sobbing with\r\nagitation.  \'I\'m sure Mr. Blunt never said no such thing!\'\r\n\r\n\'But Mother thinks it, Ellen.\'\r\n\r\n\'She doesn\'t, she can\'t!\' cried Ellen vehemently; \'I know she doesn\'t, or\r\nshe could never go about as she does.  I\'ll call her up and ask her, to\r\nsatisfy you.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no, not while that woman is there!\' cried Alfred, holding her by the\r\ndress; \'I\'ll not have _her_ coming up.\'\r\n\r\nEven while he spoke, however, Mrs. King was coming.  Betsey had spied an\r\nold acquaintance on the way from church, and had popped out to speak to\r\nher, and Mrs. King caught that moment for coming up.  She understood all,\r\nfor she had been sitting in great distress, lest Alfred should be\r\nlistening to every word which she was unable to silence, and about which\r\nBetsey was quite thoughtless.  So many people of her degree would talk to\r\nthe patient about himself and his danger, and go on constantly before him\r\nwith all their fears, and the doctor\'s opinions, that Betsey had never\r\nthought of there being more consideration and tenderness shewn in this\r\nhouse, nor that Mrs. King would have hidden any pressing danger from the\r\nsick person; but such plain words had not yet passed between her and Mr.\r\nBlunt; and though she had long felt what Alfred\'s illness would come to,\r\nthe perception had rather grown on her than come at any particular\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nNow when Ellen, with tears and agitation, asked what that Betsey had been\r\nsaying to frighten Alfred so, and when she saw her poor boy\'s look at\r\nher, and heard his sob, \'Oh, Mother!\' it was almost too much for her, and\r\nshe went up and kissed him, and laid him down less uneasily, but he felt\r\na great tear fall on his face.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not true, Mother, I\'m sure it is not true,\' cried Ellen; \'she\r\nought--\'\r\n\r\nMrs. King looked at her daughter with a sad sweet face, that stopped her\r\nshort, and brought the sense over her too.  \'Did he say so, Mother?\' said\r\nAlfred.\r\n\r\n\'Not to me, dear,\' she answered; \'but, Ellen, she\'s coming back!  She\'ll\r\nbe up here if you don\'t go down.\'\r\n\r\nPoor Ellen! what would she not have given for power to listen to her\r\nmother, and cry at her ease?  But she was forced to hurry, or Betsey\r\nwould have been half-way up-stairs in another instant.  She was a hopeful\r\ngirl, however, and after that \'not to me,\' resolved to believe nothing of\r\nthe matter.  Mrs. King knelt down by her son, and looked at him tenderly;\r\nand then, as his eyes went on begging for an answer, she said, \'Dr. Blunt\r\nnever told me there was no hope, my dear, and everything lies in God\'s\r\npower.\'\r\n\r\n\'But you don\'t think I shall get well, Mother?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t feel as if you would, my boy,\' she said, very low, and fondling\r\nhim all the time.  \'You\'ve got to cough like Father and Charlie,\r\nand--though He might raise my boy up--yet anyhow, Alfy boy, if God sees\r\nit good for us, it _will_ be good for us, and we shall be helped through\r\nwith it.\'\r\n\r\n\'But I\'m not good, Mother!  What will become of me?\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps the hearing this is all out of God\'s mercy, to give you time to\r\nget ready, my dear.  You are no worse now than you were this morning; you\r\nare not like to go yet awhile.  No, indeed, my child; so if you don\'t put\r\noff any longer--\'\r\n\r\n\'Mother!\' called up Ellen.  She was in despair.  Betsey was not to be\r\nkept by her from satisfying herself upon Alfred\'s looks, and Mrs. King\r\nwas only in time to meet her on the stairs, and tell her that he was so\r\nweak and low, that he could not be seen now, she could not tell how it\r\nwould be when he had had his tea.\r\n\r\nEllen thought she had never had so distressing a tea-drinking in her\r\nlife, as the being obliged to sit listening civilly to Betsey\'s long\r\nstory about the trouble she had about a stocking of Mrs. Martin\'s that\r\nwas lost in the wash, and that had gone to Miss Rosa Marlowe, because\r\nMrs. Martin had her things marked with a badly-done K. E. M., and all\r\nthat Mrs. Martin\'s Maria and all Miss Marlowe\'s Jane had said about it,\r\nand all Betsey\'s \'Says I to Mother,\'--when she was so longing to be\r\nwatching poor Alfred, and how her mother could sit so quietly making tea,\r\nand answering so civilly, she could not guess; but Mrs. King had that\r\nsense of propriety and desire to do as she would be done by, which is the\r\nvery substance of Christian courtesy, the very want of which made Betsey,\r\nwith all her wish to be kind, a real oppression and burthen to the whole\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nAnd where was Harold?  Ellen had not seen him coming out of church, but\r\nmeal-times were pretty certain to bring him home.\r\n\r\n\'Oh,\' said Betsey, \'I\'ll warrant he is off to the merry orchard.\'\r\n\r\n\'I hope not,\' said Mrs. King gravely.\r\n\r\n\'He never would,\' said Ellen, in anger.\r\n\r\n\'Ah, well, I always said I didn\'t see no harm in a lad getting a bit of\r\npleasure.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, indeed,\' said Mrs. King.  \'Harold knows I would not stint him in the\r\nfruit nor in the pleasure, but I should be much vexed if he could go out\r\non a Sunday, buying and selling, among such a lot as meet at that\r\norchard.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'m sure I don\'t know when poor folks is to have a holiday if not\r\non a Sunday, and the poor boy must be terrible moped with his brother so\r\nill.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not doing thine own pleasure on My holy day,\' thought Ellen, but she did\r\nnot say it, for her mother could not bear for texts to be quoted at\r\npeople.  But her heart was very heavy; and when she went up with some tea\r\nto Alfred, she looked from the window to see whether, as she hoped,\r\nHarold might be in Paul\'s hay-loft, preferring going without his tea to\r\nbeing teased by Betsey.  Paul sat in his loft, with his Bible on his\r\nknee, and his head on Caesar\'s neck.\r\n\r\n\'Alfred,\' said Ellen, \'do you know where Harold is?  Sure he is not gone\r\nto the merry orchard?\'\r\n\r\n\'Is not he come home?\' said Alfred.  \'Oh, then he is!  He is gone to the\r\nmerry orchard, breaking Sunday with Dick Royston!  And by-and-by he\'ll be\r\nill, and die, and be as miserable as I am!\'  And Alfred cried as Ellen\r\nhad never seen him cry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI--THE MERRY ORCHARD\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere was Harold?\r\n\r\nStill the evening went on, and he did not come.  Alfred had worn himself\r\nout with his fit of crying, and lay quite still, either asleep, or\r\nlooking so like it, that when Betsey had finished her tea, and again\r\nbegan asking to see him, Ellen could honestly declare that he was asleep.\r\n\r\nBetsey had bidden them good-bye, more than half affronted at not being\r\nable to report to her mother all about his looks, though she carried with\r\nher a basket of gooseberries and French beans, and Mrs. King walked all\r\nthe way down the lane with her, and tried to shew an interest in all she\r\nsaid, to make up for the disappointment.\r\n\r\nMaybe likewise Mrs. King felt it a relief to her uneasiness to look up\r\nand down the road, and along the river, and into the farm-yard, in the\r\nhope that Harold might be in sight; but nothing was to be seen on the\r\nroad, but Master Norland, his wife, and baby, soberly taking their Sunday\r\nwalk; nor by the river, except the ducks, who seemed to be enjoying their\r\nevening bath, and almost asleep on the water; nor in the yard, except\r\nPaul Blackthorn, who had come down from his perch to drive the horses in\r\nfrom the home-field, and shut the stable up for the night.\r\n\r\nShe could not help stopping a moment at the gate, and calling out to Paul\r\nto ask whether he had seen anything of Harold.  He seemed to have a great\r\nmind not to hear, and turned very slowly with his shoulder towards her,\r\nmaking a sound like \'Eh?\' as if to ask what she said.\r\n\r\n\'Have you seen my boy Harold?\'\r\n\r\n\'I saw him in the morning.\'\r\n\r\n\'Have you not seen him since?  Didn\'t he go to church with you?\'\r\n\r\n\'No; I don\'t go to Sunday school.\'\r\n\r\n\'Was he there?\'\r\n\r\nShe did not receive any answer.\r\n\r\n\'Do you know if many of the boys are gone to the merry orchard?\'\r\n\r\n\'Ay.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, you are a good lad not to be one of them.\'\r\n\r\n\'Hadn\'t got any money,\' said Paul gruffly; but Mrs. King thought he said\r\nso chiefly from dislike to be praised, and that there had been some\r\nprinciple as well as poverty to keep him away.\r\n\r\n\'It might be better if no one had it on a Sunday,\' she could not help\r\nsighing out as she looked anxiously along the lane ere turning in, and\r\nthen said, \'My good lad, I don\'t want to get you to be telling tales, but\r\nit would set my heart at rest, and his poor brother\'s up there, if you\r\ncould tell me he is not gone to Briar Alley.\'\r\n\r\nPaul turned up his face from the gate upon which he was leaning his\r\nelbows, and gazed for a moment at her sad, meek, anxious face, then\r\nexclaimed, \'I can\'t think how he could!\'\r\n\r\nPoor Paul! was it not crossing him how impossible it would seem to do\r\nanything to vex one who so cared for him?\r\n\r\n\'Then he is gone,\' she said mournfully.\r\n\r\n\'They were all at him,\' said Paul; \'and he said he\'d never seen what it\r\nwas like.  Please don\'t take on, Missus; he\'s right kind and\r\ngood-hearted, and wanted to treat me.\'\r\n\r\n\'I had rather he had hearkened to you, my boy,\' said Mrs. King.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know why he should do that,\' said Paul, perhaps meaning that a\r\nboy who heeded not such a mother would certainly heed no one else.  \'But\r\nplease, Missus,\' he added, \'don\'t beat him, for you made me tell on him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Beat him! no,\' said Mrs. King, with a sad smile; \'he\'s too big a boy for\r\nme to manage that way.  I can\'t do more than grieve if he lets himself be\r\nled away.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then I\'d like to beat him myself if he grieves you!\' burst out Paul,\r\ndoubling up his brown fist with indignation.\r\n\r\n\'But you won\'t,\' said Mrs. King gently; \'I don\'t want to make a quarrel\r\namong you, and I hope you\'ll help to keep him out of bad ways, Paul.  I\r\nlook to you for it.  Good-night.\'\r\n\r\nPerhaps the darkness and her own warm feeling made her forget the\r\ncondition of that hand; at any rate, as she said Good-night she took it\r\nin her own and shook it heartily, and then she went in.\r\n\r\nPaul did not say Good-night in answer; but when she had turned away, his\r\nhead went down between his two crossed arms upon the top of the gate, and\r\nhe did not move for many many minutes, except that his shoulders shook\r\nand shook again, for he was sobbing as he had never sobbed since Granny\r\nMoll died.  If home and home love were not matters of course to you, you\r\nmight guess what strange new fountains of feeling were stirred in the\r\nwild but not untaught boy, by that face, that voice, that touch.\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. King, as she walked to her own door in the twilight, with bitter\r\npain in her heart, could not help thinking of those from the highways and\r\nhedges who flocked to the feast set at naught by such as were bidden.\r\n\r\nA sad and mournful Sunday evening was that to the mother and daughter, as\r\neach sat over her Bible.  Mrs. King would not talk to Ellen, for fear of\r\nawakening Alfred; not that low voices would have done so, but Ellen was\r\nalready much upset by what she had heard and seen, and to talk it over\r\nwould have brought on a fit of violent crying; so her mother thought it\r\nsafest to say nothing.  They would have read their Bible to one another,\r\nbut each had her voice so choked with tears, that it would not do.\r\n\r\nThat Alfred was sinking away into the grave, was no news to Mrs. King;\r\nbut perhaps it had never been so plainly spoken to her before, and his\r\nown knowledge of it seemed to make it more sure; but broken-hearted as\r\nshe felt, she had been learning to submit to this, and it might be better\r\nand safer for him, she thought, to be aware of his state, and more ready\r\nto do his best with the time left to him.  That was not the freshest\r\nsorrow, or more truly a darker cloud had come over, namely, the feeling,\r\nso terrible to a good careful mother, that her son is breaking out of the\r\ncourses to which she has endeavoured and prayed to bring him up--that he\r\nis casting off restraint, and running into evil that may be the beginning\r\nof ruin, and with no father\'s hand to hold him in.\r\n\r\nO Harold, had you but seen the thick tears dropping on the walnut table\r\nbehind the arm that hid her face from Ellen, you would not have thought\r\nyour fun worth them!\r\n\r\nThat merry orchard was about three miles from Friarswood.  It belonged to\r\na man who kept a small public-house, and had a little farm, and a large\r\ngarden, with several cherry trees, which in May were perfect gardens of\r\nblossoms, white as snow, and in August with small black fruit of the sort\r\nknown as merries; and unhappily the fertile produce of these trees became\r\na great temptation to the owner and to all the villagers around.\r\n\r\nAs Sunday was the only day when people could be at leisure, he chose\r\nthree Sundays when the cherries were ripe for throwing open his orchard\r\nto all who chose to come and buy and eat the fruit, and of course cakes\r\nand drink of various kinds were also sold.  It was a solitary spot, out\r\nof the way of the police, or the selling in church-time would have been\r\nstopped; but as there may be cases of real distress, the law does not\r\nshut up all houses for selling food and drink on a Sunday, so others,\r\nwhere there is no necessity, take advantage of it; and so for miles round\r\nall the idle young people and children would call it a holiday to go away\r\nfrom their churches to eat cherries at Briar Alley, buying and selling on\r\na Sunday, noisy and clamorous, and forgetting utterly that it was the\r\nLord\'s Day, not their day of idle pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt was a sad pity that an innocent feast of fruit should be almost out of\r\nreach, unless enjoyed in this manner.  To be sure, merries might be\r\nbought any day of the week at Briar Alley, and were hawked up and down\r\nFriarswood so cheaply that any one might get a mouth as purple as the\r\nblack spaniel\'s any day in the season; but that was nothing to the fun of\r\ngoing with numbers, and numbers never could go except on a Sunday.  But\r\nif people wish to serve God truly, why, they must make up their minds to\r\nmiss pleasures for His sake, and this was one to begin with; and I am\r\nmuch mistaken if the happiness of the week would not have turned out\r\ngreater in the end with him.  Ay, and as to the owner of the trees, who\r\nsaid he was a poor man, and could not afford to lose the profit, I\r\nbelieve that if he would have trusted God and kept His commandment, his\r\nprofit in the long run would have been greater here, to say nothing of\r\nthe peril to his own soul of doing wrong, and leading so many into\r\ntemptation.\r\n\r\nThe Kings had been bred up to think a Sunday going to the merry orchard a\r\nthing never to be done; and in his most idle days Alfred would never have\r\ndreamt of such a thing.  Indeed, their good mother always managed to have\r\nsome treat to make up for it when they were little; and they certainly\r\nnever wanted for merries, nay, a merry pudding had been their dinner this\r\nvery day, with savage-looking purple juice and scalding hot stones.  If\r\nHarold went it was for the frolic, not for want of the dainty; and wrong\r\nas it was, his mother was grieving more at the thought of his casting\r\naway the restraint of his old habits than for the one action.  One son\r\ngoing away into the unseen world, the other being led away from the paths\r\nof right--no wonder she wept as she tried to read!\r\n\r\nAt last voices were coming, and very loud ones.  The summer night was so\r\nstill, they could be heard a great way--those rude coarse voices of\r\nvillage boys boasting and jeering one another.\r\n\r\n\'I say, wouldn\'t you like to be one of they chaps at Ragglesford School?\'\r\n\r\n\'What lots they bought there on Saturday, to be sure!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well they may: they\'ve lots of tin!\'\r\n\r\n\'Have they?  How d\'ye know?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, the money-letters!  Don\'t I know the feel of them--directed to\r\nmaster this and master that, and with a seal and a card, and half a\r\nsovereign, or maybe a whole one, under it; and such lots as they gets\r\nbefore the holidays--that\'s to go home, you see.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, it\'s a shame such little impudent rogues should get so much\r\nwithout ever doing a stroke of work for it.\'\r\n\r\n\'I say, Harold, don\'t ye never put one of they letters in your pocket?\'\r\n\r\n\'For shame, Dick!\'\r\n\r\n\'Ha!  I shall know where to come when I wants half a sovereign or so!\'\r\n\r\n\'No, you won\'t.\'\r\n\r\nIt was only these last two or three speeches that reached the cottage at\r\nall clearly; and they were followed by a sound as if Harold had fallen\r\nupon one of the others, and they were holding him off, with halloos and\r\nshouts of hoarse laughing, which broke Alfred\'s sleep, and his voice came\r\ndown-stairs with a startled cry of \'Mother!  Mother! what is that?\'  She\r\nran up-stairs in haste, and Ellen threw the door open.  The sudden\r\ndisplay of the light silenced the noisy boys; and Harold came slowly up\r\nthe garden-path, pretty certain of a scolding, and prepared to feel it as\r\nlittle as he could help.\r\n\r\n\'Well, Master, a nice sort of a way of spending a Sunday evening this!\'\r\nbegan Ellen; \'and coming hollaing up the lane, just on purpose to wake\r\npoor Alfred, when he\'s so ill!\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure I never meant to wake him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then what did you bring all that good-for-nothing set roaring and\r\nshouting up the road for?  And just this evening, too, when one would\r\nhave thought you would we have cared for poor Mother and Alfred,\' said\r\nshe, crying.\r\n\r\n\'Why, what\'s the matter now?\' said Harold.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, they\'ve been saying he can\'t live out the winter,\' said Ellen,\r\nshedding the tears that had been kept back all this time, and broke out\r\nnow with double force, in her grief for one brother and vexation with the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nBut next winter seemed a great way off to Harold, and he was put out\r\nbesides, so he did not seem shocked, especially as he was reproached with\r\nnot feeling what he did not know; so all he did was to say angrily, \'And\r\nhow was I to know that?\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course you don\'t know anything, going scampering over the country\r\nwith the worst lot you can find, away from church and all, not caring for\r\nanything!  Poor Mother! she never thought one of her lads would come to\r\nthat!\'\r\n\r\n\'Plenty does so, without never such a fuss,\' said Harold.  \'Why, what\r\nharm is there in eating a few cherries?\'\r\n\r\nThere would be very little pleasure or use in knowing what a wrangling\r\nwent on all the time Mrs. King was up-stairs putting Alfred to bed.  Ellen\r\nhad all the right on her side, but she did not use it wisely; she was\r\nvery unhappy, and much displeased with Harold, and so she had it all out\r\nin a fretful manner that made him more cross and less feeling than was\r\nhis nature.\r\n\r\nThere was something he did feel, however--and that was his mother\'s pale,\r\nworn, sorrowful face, when she came down-stairs and hushed Ellen, but did\r\nnot speak to him.  They took down the books, read their chapter, and she\r\nread prayers very low, and not quite steadily.  He would have liked very\r\nmuch to have told her he felt sorry, but he was too proud to do so after\r\nhaving shewn Ellen he was above caring for such nonsense.\r\n\r\nSo they all went to bed, Harold on a little landing at the top of the\r\nstairs; but--whether it was from the pounds of merry-stones he had\r\nswallowed, or the talk he had had with his sister--he could not go to\r\nsleep, and lay tossing and tumbling about, thinking it very odd he had\r\nnot heeded more what Ellen had said when he first came in, and the notion\r\ndawning on him more and more, that day after day would come and make\r\nAlfred worse, and that by the time summer came again he should be alone.\r\nWho could have said it?  Why had not he asked?  What could he have been\r\nthinking about?  It should not be true!  A sort of frenzy to speak to\r\nsome one, and hear the real meaning of those words, so as to make sure\r\nthey were only Ellen\'s nonsense, came over him in the silent darkness.\r\nPresently he heard Alfred moving on his pillow, for the door was open for\r\nthe heat; and that long long sigh made him call in a whisper, \'Alf, are\r\nyou awake?\'\r\n\r\nIn another moment Harold was by his brother\'s side.  \'Alf!  Alf! are you\r\nworse?\' he asked, whispering.\r\n\r\n\'No.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then what\'s all this?  What did they say?  It\'s all stuff; I\'m sure it\r\nis, and you\'re getting better.  But what did Ellen mean?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Harold,\' said Alfred, getting his brother\'s hand in his, \'it\'s not\r\nstuff; I shan\'t get well; I\'m going after poor Charlie; and don\'t you be\r\na bad lad, Harold, and run away from your church, for you don\'t know--how\r\nbad it feels to--\' and Alfred turned his face down, for the tears were\r\ncoming thick.\r\n\r\n\'But you aren\'t going to die, Alf.  Charlie never was like you, I know he\r\nwasn\'t; he was always coughing.  It is all Ellen.  Who said it?  I won\'t\r\nlet them.\'\r\n\r\n\'The doctor said it to Betsey Hardman,\' said Alfred; and his cough was\r\nonly too like his brother\'s.\r\n\r\nHarold would have said a great deal in contempt of Betsey Hardman, but\r\nAlfred did not let him.\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll wake Mother,\' he said.  \'Hush, Harold, don\'t go stamping about; I\r\ncan\'t bear it!  No, I don\'t want any one to tell me now; I\'ve been\r\ngetting worse ever since I was taken, and--oh! be quiet, Harold.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t be quiet,\' sobbed Harold, coming nearer to him.  \'O Alf!  I\r\ncan\'t spare you!  There hasn\'t been no proper downright fun without you,\r\nand--\'\r\n\r\nHarold had lain down by him and clung to his hand, trying not to sob\r\naloud.\r\n\r\n\'O Harold!\' sighed Alfred, \'I don\'t think I should mind--at least not so\r\nmuch--if I hadn\'t been such a bad boy.\'\r\n\r\n\'You, Alfy!  Who was ever a good boy if you was not?\'\r\n\r\n\'Hush!  You forget all about when I was up at my Lady\'s, and all that.\r\nOh! and how bad I behaved at church, and when I was so saucy to Master\r\nabout the marbles; and so often I\'ve not minded Mother.  O Harold! and\r\nGod judges one for everything!\'\r\n\r\nWhat a sad terrified voice it was!\r\n\r\n\'Oh! don\'t go on so, Alf!  I can\'t bear it!  Why, we are but boys; and\r\nthose things were so long ago!  God will not be hard on little boys.  He\r\nis merciful, don\'t you know?\'\r\n\r\n\'But when I knew it was wrong, I did the worst I could!\' said Alfred.\r\n\'Oh, if I could only begin all over again, now I do care!  Only, Harold,\r\nHarold, you are well; you can be good now when there\'s time.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll be ever so good if you\'ll only get well,\' said Harold.  \'I wouldn\'t\r\nhave gone to that there place to-night; but \'tis so terribly dull, and\r\none must do something.\'\r\n\r\n\'But in church-time, and on Sunday!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I\'ll never do it again; but it was so sunshiny, and they were all\r\nmaking such fun, you see, and it did seem so stuffy, and so long and\r\ntiresome, I couldn\'t help it, you see.\'\r\n\r\nAlfred did not think of asking how, if Harold could not help it this\r\ntime, he could be sure of never doing so again.  He was more inclined to\r\ndwell on himself, and went back to that one sentence, \'God judges us for\r\neverything.\'  Harold thought he meant it for him, and exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\'Yes, yes, I know, but--oh, Alf, you shouldn\'t frighten one so; I never\r\nmeant no harm.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wasn\'t thinking about that,\' sighed Alfred.  \'I was wishing I\'d been a\r\nbetter lad; but I\'ve been worse, and crosser, and more unkind, ever since\r\nI was ill.  O Harold! what shall I do?\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t go on that way,\' said Harold, crying bitterly.  \'Say your prayers,\r\nand maybe you will get well; and then in the morning I\'ll ask Mr. Cope to\r\ncome down, and he\'ll tell you not to mind.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wouldn\'t listen to Mr. Cope when he told me to be sorry for my sins;\r\nand oh, Harold, if we are not sorry, you know they will not be taken\r\naway.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, but you are sorry now.\'\r\n\r\n\'I have heard tell that there are two ways of being sorry, and I don\'t\r\nknow if mine is the right.\'\r\n\r\n\'I tell you I\'ll fetch Mr. Cope in the morning; and when the doctor comes\r\nhe\'ll be sure to say it is all a pack of stuff, and you need not be\r\nfretting yourself.\'\r\n\r\nWhen Harold awoke in the morning, he found himself lying wrapped in his\r\ncoverlet on Alfred\'s bed, and then he remembered all about it, and looked\r\nin haste, as though he expected to see some sudden and terrible change in\r\nhis brother.\r\n\r\nBut Alfred was looking cheerful, he had awakened without discomfort; and\r\nwith some amusement, was watching the starts and movements, the grunts\r\nand groans, of Harold\'s waking.  The morning air and the ordinary look of\r\nthings, had driven away the gloomy thoughts of evening, and he chiefly\r\nthought of them as something strange and dreadful, and yet not quite a\r\ndream.\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t tell Mother,\' whispered Harold, recollecting himself, and starting\r\nup quietly.\r\n\r\n\'But you\'ll fetch Mr. Cope,\' said Alfred earnestly.\r\n\r\nHarold had begun not to like the notion of meeting Mr. Cope, lest he\r\nshould hear something of yesterday\'s doings, and he did not like Alfred\r\nor himself to think of last night\'s alarm, so he said, \'Oh, very well,\r\nI\'ll see about it.\'\r\n\r\nHe had not made up his mind.  Very likely, if chance had brought him face\r\nto face with Mr. Cope, he would have spoken about Alfred as the best way\r\nto hinder the Curate from reproving himself; but he had not that right\r\nsort of boldness which would have made him go to meet the reproof he so\r\nrichly deserved, and he was trying to persuade himself either that when\r\nAlfred was amused and cheery, he would forget all about \'that there\r\nBetsey\'s nonsense,\' or else that Mr. Cope might come that way of himself.\r\n\r\nBut Alfred was not likely to forget.  What he had heard hung on him\r\nthrough all the little occupations of the morning, and made him meek and\r\ngentle under them, and he was reckoning constantly upon Mr. Cope\'s\r\ncoming, fastening on the notion as if he were able to save him.\r\n\r\nStill the Curate came not, and Alfred became grieved, feeling as if he\r\nwas neglected.\r\n\r\nMr. Blunt, however, came, and at any rate he would have it out with him;\r\nso he asked at once very straightforwardly, \'Am I going to die, Sir?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, what\'s put that in your head?\' said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\'There was a person here talking last night, Sir,\' said Mrs. King.\r\n\r\n\'Well, but am I?\' said Alfred impatiently.\r\n\r\n\'Not just yet, I hope,\' said Mr. Blunt cheerfully.  \'You are weak, but\r\nyou\'ll pick up again.\'\r\n\r\n\'But of this?\' persisted Alfred, who was not to be trifled with.\r\n\r\nMr. Blunt saw he must be in earnest.\r\n\r\n\'My boy,\' he said, \'I\'m afraid it is not a thing to be got over.  I\'ll do\r\nthe best I can for you, by God\'s blessing; and if you get through the\r\nwinter, and it is a mild spring, you might do; but you\'d better settle\r\nyour mind that you can\'t be many years for this world.\'\r\n\r\nMany years! that sounded like a reprieve, and sent gladness into Ellen\'s\r\nheart; but somehow it did not seem in the same light to Alfred; he felt\r\nthat if he were slowly going down hill and wasting away, so as to have no\r\nmore health or strength in which to live differently from ever before,\r\nthe length of time was not much to him, and in his sickly impatience he\r\nwould almost have preferred that it should not be what Betsey kindly\r\ncalled \'a lingering job.\'\r\n\r\nThere he lay after Mr. Blunt was gone, not giving Ellen any trouble,\r\nexcept by the sad thoughtfulness of his face, as he lay dwelling on all\r\nthat he wanted to say to Mr. Cope, and the terror of his sin and of\r\njudgment sweeping over him every now and then.\r\n\r\nStill Mr. Cope came not.  Alfred at last began to wonder aloud, and asked\r\nif Harold had said anything about it when he came in to dinner; but he\r\nheard that Harold had only rushed in for a moment, snatched up a lump of\r\nbread and cheese, and made off to the river with some of the lads who\r\nmeant to spend the noon-tide rest in bathing.\r\n\r\nWhen he came for the evening letters he was caught, and Mr. Cope was\r\nasked for; and then it came out that Harold had never given the message\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nAlfred, greatly hurt, and sadly worn by his day of expectation, had no\r\nself-restraint left, and flew out into a regular passion, calling his\r\nbrother angry names.  Harold, just as passionate, went into a rage too,\r\nand scolded his brother for his fancies.  Mrs. King, in great\r\ndispleasure, turned him out, and he rushed off to ride like one mad to\r\nElbury; and poor Alfred remained so much shocked at his own outbreak,\r\njust when he meant to have been good ever after, and sobbing so\r\nmiserably, that no one could calm him at all; and Ellen, as the only\r\nhope, put on her bonnet to fetch Mr. Cope.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Paul was come for his bit of bread.  She found him looking\r\ndismayed at the sounds of violent weeping from above, and he asked what\r\nit was.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, Alfred is so low and so bad, and he wants Mr. Cope!  Here\'s your\r\nbread, don\'t keep me!\'\r\n\r\n\'Let me go!  I\'ll be quicker!\' cried Paul; and before she could thank\r\nhim, he was down the garden and right across the first field.\r\n\r\nAlfred had had time to cry himself exhausted, and to be lying very still,\r\nalmost faint, before Mr. Cope came in in the summer twilight.  Good Paul!\r\nHe had found that Mr. Cope was dining at Ragglesford and had run all the\r\nway thither; and here was the kind young Curate, quite breathless with\r\nhis haste, and never regretting the cheerful party whence he had been\r\ncalled away.  All Alfred could say was, \'O Sir, I shall die; and I\'m a\r\nbad boy, and wouldn\'t heed you when you said so.\'\r\n\r\n\'And God has made you see your sins, my poor boy,\' said Mr. Cope.  \'That\r\nis a great blessing.\'\r\n\r\n\'But if I can\'t do anything to make up for them, what\'s the use?  And I\r\nnever shall be well again.\'\r\n\r\n\'You can\'t make up for them; but there is One Who has made up for them,\r\nif you will only truly repent.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wasn\'t sorry till I knew I should die,\' said Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'No, your sins did not come home to you!  Now, do you know what they\r\nare?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes; I\'ve been a bad boy to Mother, and at church; and I\'ve been\r\ncross to Ellen, and quarrelled with Harold; and I was so audacious at my\r\nLady\'s, they couldn\'t keep me.  I never did want really to be good.  Oh!\r\nI know I shall go to the bad place!\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Alfred, not if you so repent, that you can hold to our Blessed\r\nSaviour\'s promise.  There is a fountain open for sin and all\r\nuncleanness.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is very good of Him,\' said Alfred, a little more tranquilly, not in\r\nthe half-sob in which he had before spoken.\r\n\r\n\'Most merciful!\' said Mr. Cope.\r\n\r\n\'But does it mean me?\' continued Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'You were baptized, Alfred, you have a right to all His promises of\r\npardon.\'  And he repeated the blessed sentences:\r\n\r\n\'Come unto Me, all that travail and are heavy laden, and I will refresh\r\nyou.\'\r\n\r\n\'God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, to the end\r\nthat all that believe in Him should not perish, but have everlasting\r\nlife.\'\r\n\r\n\'But how ought I to believe, Sir?\'\r\n\r\n\'You say you feel what your sins are; think of them all as you lie, each\r\none as you remember it; say it out in your heart to our Saviour, and pray\r\nGod to forgive it for His sake, and then think that it cost some of the\r\npain He bore on the Cross, some of the drops of His agony in the Garden.\r\nEach sin of ours was indeed of that burden!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, that will make them seem so bad!\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed it does; but how it will make you love Him, and feel thankful to\r\nHim, and anxious not to waste the sufferings borne for your sake, and\r\nglad, perhaps, that you are bearing some small thing yourself.  But you\r\nare spent, and I had better not talk more now.  Let me read you a few\r\nprayers to help you, and then I will leave you, and come again\r\nto-morrow.\'\r\n\r\nHow differently those Prayers and Psalms sounded to Alfred now that he\r\nhad really a heart grieved and wearied with the burthen of sin!  The\r\npoint was to make his not a frightened heart, but a contrite heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII--HAROLD TAKES A WRONG TURN\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. King was very anxious about Alfred for many hours after this visit\r\nfrom the Curate, for he was continually crying, not violently, but the\r\ntears flowing quietly from his eyes as he lay, thinking.  Sometimes it\r\nwas the badness of the faults as he saw them now, looking so very\r\ndifferent from what they did when they were committed in the carelessness\r\nof fun and high spirits, or viewed afterwards in the hardening light of\r\nself-justification.  Now they did look so wantonly hard and rude--unkind\r\nto his sister, ruinous to Harold, regardless of his widowed mother,\r\nreckless of his God--that each one seemed to cut into him with a sense of\r\nits own badness, and he was quite as much grieved as afraid; he hated the\r\nfault, and hated himself for it.\r\n\r\nIndeed, he was growing less afraid, for the sorrow seemed to swallow that\r\nup; the grief at having offended One so loving was putting out the terror\r\nof being punished; or rather, when he thought that this illness was\r\npunishment, he was almost glad to have some of what he deserved; just as\r\nwhen he was a little boy, he really used to be happier afterwards for\r\nhaving been whipped and put in the corner, because that was like making\r\nit up.  Though he knew very well that if he had ten thousand times worse\r\nthan this to bear, it would not be making up for his faults, and he felt\r\nnow that one of them had been his \'despising the chastening of the Lord.\'\r\nAnd then the thought of what had made up for it would come: and though he\r\nhad known of it all his life, and heeded it all too little, now that his\r\nheart was tender, and he had felt some of the horror and pain of sin, he\r\ntook it all home now, and clung to it.  He recollected the verses about\r\nthat One kneeling--nay, falling on the ground, in the cold dewy night,\r\nwith the chosen friends who could not watch with Him, and the agony and\r\nmisery that every one in all the world deserved to feel, gathering on\r\nHim, Who had done no wrong, and making His brow stream with great drops\r\nof Blood.\r\n\r\nAnd the tortures, the shame, the slow Death--circumstance after\r\ncircumstance came to his mind, and \'for me,\' \'this fault of mine helped,\'\r\nwould rise with it, and the tears trickled down at the thought of the\r\nsuffering and of the Love that had caused it to be undergone.\r\n\r\nOnce he raised up his head, and saw through the window the deep dark-blue\r\nsky, and the stars, twinkling and sparkling away; that pale band of\r\nlight, the Milky Way, which they say is made of countless stars too far\r\noff to be distinguished, and looking like a cloud, and on it the larger,\r\nbrighter burnished stars, differing from one another in glory.  He\r\nthought of some lines in a book Miss Jane once gave Ellen, which said of\r\nthe stars:\r\n\r\n   \'The Lord resigned them all to gain\r\n   The bliss of pardoning thee.\'\r\n\r\nAnd when he thought that it was the King of those stars Who was scourged\r\nand spit on, and for the sake of _his_ faults, the loving tears came\r\nagain, and he turned to another hymn of Ellen\'s:\r\n\r\n   \'Rock of Ages, cleft for me,\r\n   Let me hide myself in Thee!\'\r\n\r\nAnd going on with this, he fell into a more quiet sleep than he had had\r\nfor many nights.\r\n\r\nAlfred had worked up his mind to a point where it could not long remain;\r\nand when he awoke in the morning, the common affairs of the day occupied\r\nhim in a way that was not hurtful to him, as the one chief thought was\r\never present, only laid away for a time, and helping him when he might\r\nhave been fretful or impatient.\r\n\r\nHe was anxious for Mr. Cope, and grateful when he saw him coming early in\r\nthe day.  Mr. Cope did not, however, say anything very new.  He chiefly\r\nwished to shew Alfred that he must not think all his struggle with sin\r\nover, and that he had nothing to do but to lie still and be pardoned.\r\nThere was much more work, as he would find, when the present strong\r\nfeeling should grow a little blunt; he would have to keep his will bent\r\nto bear what was sent by God, and to prove his repentance by curing\r\nhimself of all his bad habits of peevishness and exacting; to learn, in\r\nfact, to take up his cross.\r\n\r\nAlfred feebly promised to try, and it did not seem so difficult just\r\nthen.  The days were becoming cooler, and he did not feel quite so ill;\r\nand though he did not know how much this helped him, it made it much\r\neasier to act on his good resolutions.  Miss Selby came to see him, and\r\nwas quite delighted to see him looking so much less uncomfortable and\r\ndismal.\r\n\r\n\'Why, Alfred,\' said she, \'you must be much better.\'\r\n\r\nEllen looked mournful at this, and shook her head so that Miss Jane\r\nturned her bright face to her in alarm.\r\n\r\n\'No, Ma\'am,\' said Alfred.  \'Dr. Blunt says I can never get over it.\'\r\n\r\n\'And does that make you glad?\' almost gasped Miss Jane.\r\n\r\n\'No, Ma\'am,\' said Alfred; \'but Mr. Cope has been talking to me, and made\r\nit all so--\'\r\n\r\nHe could not get out the words; and, besides, he saw Miss Jane\'s eyes\r\nwinking very fast to check the tears, and Ellen\'s had begun to rain down\r\nfast.\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t mean to be silly,\' said little Jane, in rather a trembling\r\nvoice; \'but I\'m sorry--no--I\'m glad you are happy and good, Alfred.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not good, Miss Jane,\' cried Alfred; \'I\'m such a bad boy, but there are\r\nsuch good things as I never minded before--\'\r\n\r\n\'Well then, I think you\'ll like what I\'ve brought you,\' said Jane\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\nIt was a little framed picture of our Blessed Lord on His Cross, all\r\ndarkness round, and the Inscription above His Head; and Miss Jane had\r\npainted, in tall Old English red letters, under it the two words, \'For\r\nme.\'\r\n\r\nAlfred looked at it as if indeed it would be a great comfort to him to be\r\nalways reminded by the eye, of how \'He was wounded for our\r\ntransgressions, and bruised for our iniquities.\'\r\n\r\nHe thanked Miss Jane with all his heart, and she and Ellen soon found a\r\nplace to hang it up well in his sight.  It was a pretty bright sight to\r\nsee her insisting on holding the nail for it, and then playfully\r\npretending to shrink and fancy that Ellen would hammer her fingers.\r\n\r\nAlfred could enjoy the sunshine of his sick-room again; and Ellen and his\r\nmother down-stairs told Miss Selby, with many tears, of the happy change\r\nthat had come over him ever since he had resigned himself to give up\r\nhopes of life.  Mrs. King looked so peaceful and thankful, that little\r\nJane could hardly understand what it was that made her so much more at\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nEven Ellen, though her heart ached at the hope having gone out, and left\r\na dark place where it had been, felt the great relief from hour to hour\r\nof not being fretted and snarled at for whatever she either did or left\r\nundone.  Thanks and smiles were much pleasanter payment than groans,\r\nmurmurs, and scoldings; and the brother and sister sometimes grew quite\r\ncheerful and merry together, as Alfred lay raised up to look over the\r\nhedge into the harvest-field across the meadow, where the reaper and his\r\nwife might be seen gathering the brown ears round, and cutting them with\r\nthe sickle, and others going after to bind them into the glorious wheat\r\nsheaves that leant against each other in heaps of blessed promise of\r\nplenty.\r\n\r\nPaul tried reaping; but the first thing he did was to make a terrible cut\r\nin his hand, which the shuffler told him was for good luck!  Some of the\r\nwomen in the field bound it up, but he was good for nothing after it\r\nexcept going after the cattle, and so he was likely to lose all the\r\nchance of earning himself any better clothes in harvest-time.\r\n\r\nHarold grumbled dreadfully that his mother could not spare him to go\r\nharvesting beyond their own tiny quarter of an acre of wheat.  The post\r\nmade it impossible for him to go out to work like the labourers; and\r\nbesides, his mother did not think he had gained much good in hay-time,\r\nand wished to keep him from the boys.\r\n\r\nVery hard he thought it; and to hear him grumble, any one would have\r\nthought Mrs. King was a tyrant far worse than Farmer Shepherd, working\r\nthe flesh off his bones, taking away the fun and the payment alike.\r\n\r\nThe truth was, that the morning when Harold threw away from him the\r\nthought of his brother\'s danger, and broke all his promises to him in the\r\nselfish fear of a rebuke from the clergyman, had been one of the turning-\r\npoints of his life, and a turning-point for the bad.  It had been a\r\nhardening of his heart, just as it had begun to be touched, and a letting\r\nin of evil spirits instead of good ones.\r\n\r\nHe became more than ever afraid of Mr. Cope, and shirked going near him\r\nso as to be spoken to; he cut Ellen off short if she said a word to him,\r\nand avoided being with Alfred, partly because it made him melancholy,\r\npartly because he was afraid of Alfred\'s again talking to him about the\r\nevil of his ways.  In reality, his secret soul was wretched at the\r\nthought of losing his brother; but he tried to put the notion away from\r\nhim, and to drown it in the noisiest jokes and most riotous sports he\r\ncould meet with, keeping company with the wildest lads about the parish.\r\nThat Dick Royston especially, whose honesty was doubtful, but who, being\r\na clever fellow, was a sort of leader, was doing great harm by setting\r\nhis face against the new parson, and laughing at the boys who went to\r\nhim.  Mrs. King was very unhappy.  It was almost worse to think of Harold\r\nthan of his sick brother; and Alfred grieved very much too, and took to\r\nhimself the blame of having made home miserable to Harold, and driven him\r\ninto bad company; of having been so peevish and unpleasant, that it was\r\nno wonder he would not come near him more than could be helped; and above\r\nall, of having set a bad example of idleness and recklessness, when he\r\nwas well.  If the tears were brought into his eyes at first by some\r\nunkind neglect of Harold\'s, they were sure to end in this thought at\r\nlast; and then the only comfort was, that Mr. Cope had told him that he\r\nmight make his sick-bed very precious to his brother\'s welfare, by\r\npraying always for him.\r\n\r\nMr. Cope had talked it over with Mrs. King; and they had agreed that as\r\nHarold was under the regular age for Confirmation, and seemed so little\r\ndisposed to prepare for it in earnest, they would not press it on him.  He\r\nwas far from fit for it, and he was in such a mood of impatient\r\nirreverence, that Mr. Cope was afraid of making his sin worse by forcing\r\nserious things on him, and his mother was in constant fear of losing her\r\nlast hold on him.\r\n\r\nYet Harold was not a bad or unfeeling boy by nature; and if he would but\r\nhave paused to think, he would have been shocked to see how cruelly he\r\nwas paining his widowed mother and dying brother, just when he should\r\nhave been their strength and stay.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon in October, when Alfred was in a good deal of pain, Mr.\r\nBlunt said he would send out some cooling ointment for the wound at the\r\njoint, when Harold took the evening letters into Elbury.  Alfred reckoned\r\nmuch on the relief this was to give, and watched the ticks of the clock\r\nfor the time for Harold to set off.\r\n\r\n\'Make haste,\' were the last words his mother spoke--and Harold fully\r\nmeant to make haste; nor was it weather to tempt him to stay long, for\r\nthere was a chill raw fog hanging over the meadows, and fast turning into\r\nrain, which hung in drops upon his eyebrows, and the many-tiered cape of\r\nhis father\'s box-coat, which he always wore in bad weather.  It was\r\nfortunate he was likely to meet nothing, and that he and the pony both\r\nknew the road pretty well.\r\n\r\nHow fuzzy the grey fog made the lamps of the town look!  Did they disturb\r\nthe pony?  What a stumble!  Ha! there\'s a shoe off.  Be it known that it\r\nwas Harold\'s own fault; he had not looked at the shoes for many a\r\nmorning, as he knew it was his duty to do.\r\n\r\nHe left Peggy with her ears back, much discomposed at being shod in a\r\nstrange forge, and by any one but Bill Saunders.\r\n\r\nThen Harold was going to leave his bag at the post-office, when, as he\r\nturned up the street, some one caught hold of him, and cried, \'Ho!  Harold\r\nKing on foot!  What\'s the row?  Old pony tumbled down dead?\'\r\n\r\n\'Cast a shoe,\' said Harold.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, jolly, you\'ll have to wait!\' went on Dick Royston.  \'Come in here!\r\nHere\'s such a lark!\'\r\n\r\nHarold looked into a court-yard belonging to a low public-house, and saw\r\nwhat was like a tent, with a bright red star on a blue ground at the end,\r\nlighted up.  A dark figure came between, and there was a sudden crack\r\nthat made Harold start.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s the unique (he called it eu-ni-quee) royal shooting-gallery,\r\npatronized by his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales,\' (what a story!)\r\nsaid Dick.  \'You\'ve only to lay down your tin; one copper for three\r\nshots, and if you hit, you may take your choice--gingerbread-nuts, or\r\nbits of cocoa-nut, or, what\'s jolliest, lollies with gin inside \'em!\r\nCome, blaze away! or ha\'n\'t you got the money?  Does Mother keep you too\r\nshort?\'\r\n\r\nIf there was a thing Harold had a longing for, it was to fire off a gun!\r\nIf there was a person he envied more than another, it was old Isaac\r\nCoffin, when he prowled up and down Farmer Ledbitter\'s fields with an old\r\nblunderbuss and some powder, to keep off the birds!\r\n\r\nTo be sure it was a public-house, but it was not inside one!  And Mother\r\nwould call it gambling.  Oh, but it wasn\'t cards or skittles!  And if he\r\nshot away his half-pence, how should he pay for the shoeing of the pony?\r\nThe blacksmith might trust him, or the clerk at the post-office would\r\nlend him the money, or Betsey Hardman.  And the time?  One shot would not\r\nwaste much!  Pony must be shod.  Besides, Dick and all the rest would say\r\nhe was a baby.\r\n\r\nHe paid the penny, threw aside his cap, and took the gun, though after\r\nall it was only a sham one, and what a miss he made!  What business had\r\nevery one to set up that great hoarse laugh? which made him so angry that\r\nhe had nearly turned on Dick and cuffed him for his pains.\r\n\r\nHowever, he was the more bent on trying again, and the owner of the\r\ngallery shewed him how to manage better.  He hit anything but the middle\r\nof the star, and just saw how he thought he might hit next time.  Next\r\ntime was barely a miss, so that the man actually gave him a gin-drop to\r\nencourage him.  That made him mad to meet with real success; but it was\r\nthe turn of another \'young gent,\' as the man called him, and Harold had\r\nto stand by, with his penny in his hand, burning with impatience, and\r\nfancying he could mend each shot of that young gent, and another, and\r\nanother, and another, who all thrust in to claim their rights before him.\r\nHis turn came at last; and so short and straight was the gallery, that he\r\nreally did hit once the side of the star, and once the middle, and thus\r\ngained one gingerbread-nut, and three of the gin-drops.\r\n\r\nIt would have been his nature to share them with Alfred, but he could not\r\ndo so without saying where he had been, and that he could not do, so he\r\ngave one to Dick, and swallowed the rest to keep out the cold.\r\n\r\nJust then the town clock struck six, and frightened him.  He had been\r\nthere three-quarters of an hour.  What would they say at the post-office?\r\n\r\nThe clerk looked out of his hole as angry as clerk could look.  \'This\r\nwon\'t do, King,\' he said.  \'Late for sorting!  Fine, remember--near an\r\nhour after time.\'\r\n\r\n\'Pony cast a shoe, Sir,\' said Harold.  He had never been so near a\r\ndownright falsehood.\r\n\r\n\'Whew!  Then I suppose I must not report you this time!  But look out!\r\nYou\'re getting slack.\'\r\n\r\nNo time this for borrowing of the clerk.  Harold was really frightened,\r\nfor he _had_ dawdled much more than he ought of late, and though he\r\nsometimes fancied himself sick of the whole post business, a complaint to\r\nhis mother would be a dreadful matter.  It put everything else out of his\r\nhead; and he ran off in great haste to get the money from Betsey Hardman,\r\nknocking loud at her green door.\r\n\r\nWhat a cloud of steamy heat the room was, with the fire glowing like a\r\nred furnace, and five black irons standing up before it; and\r\nclothes-baskets full of heaps of whiteness, and horses with vapoury webs\r\nof lace and cambric hanging on them; and the three ironing-boards, where\r\nsmoothness ran along with the irons; and the heaps of folded clothes; and\r\nBetsey in her white apron, broad and red in the midst of her maidens!\r\n\r\n\'Ha!  Harold King!  Well, to be sure, you are a stranger!  Don\'t come\r\nnigh that there hoss; it\'s Mrs. Parnell\'s best pocket-handkerchiefs, real\r\nWalencines!\' (she meant Valenciennes.)  \'If you\'ll just run up and see\r\nMother, I\'ll have it out of the way, and we\'ll have a cup of tea.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, but I--\'\r\n\r\n\'My!  What a smoke ye\'re in!  Take care, or I shall have \'em all to do\r\nover again.  Go up to Mother, do, like a good lad.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t, Betsey; I must go home.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ay! that\'s the way.  Lads never can sit down sensible and comfortable!\r\nit\'s all the same--\'\r\n\r\n\'I wanted,\' said Harold, interrupting her, \'to ask you to lend me\r\nsixpence.  Pony\'s cast a shoe, and I had to leave her with the smith.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ay?  Who did you leave her with?\'\r\n\r\n\'The first I came to, up in Wood Street.\'\r\n\r\n\'Myers.  Ye shouldn\'t have done that.  His wife\'s the most stuck-up proud\r\nbody I ever saw--wears steel petticoats, I\'ll answer for it.  You should\r\nhave gone to Charles Shaw.\'\r\n\r\n\'Can\'t help it,\' said Harold.  \'Please, Betsey, let me have the sixpence;\r\nI\'ll pay you faithfully to-morrow!\'\r\n\r\n\'Ay! that\'s always the way.  Never come in unless ye want somewhat.\r\n\'Twasn\'t the way your poor father went on!  He\'d a civil word for every\r\none.  Well, and can\'t you stop a minute to say how your poor brother is?\'\r\n\r\n\'Much the same,\' said Harold impatiently.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, he\'ll never be no better, poor thing!  All decliny; as I says to\r\nMother, what a misfortune it is upon poor Cousin King! they\'ll all go\r\noff, one after t\'other, just like innocents to the slaughter.\'\r\n\r\nThis was not a cheerful prediction; and Harold petulantly said he must\r\nget back, and begged for the sixpence.  He got it at last, but not till\r\nall Betsey\'s pocket had been turned out; and finding nothing but\r\nshillings and threepenny-bits, she went all through her day\'s expenses\r\naloud, calling all her girls to witness to help her to account for the\r\nsixpence that ought to have been there.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brown had paid her four and sixpence--one florin and a\r\nhalf-crown--and she had three threepenny-pieces in her pocket, and\r\ntwopence.  Then Sally had been out and got a shilling\'s-worth of soap,\r\nand six-penn\'orth of blue, and brought home one shilling; and there was\r\nthe sausages--no one could recollect what they had cost, though they\r\ntalked so much about their taste; and five-pence-worth of red-herrings,\r\nand the butter; yes, and threepence to the beggar who said he had been in\r\nSebastopol.  Harold\'s head was ready to turn round before it was all\r\ndone; but he got away at last, with a scolding for not going up to see\r\nMother.\r\n\r\nHome he trotted as hard as the pony would go, holding his head down to\r\ntry to bury nose and mouth in his collar, and the thick rain plastering\r\nhis hair, and streaming down the back of his neck.  What an ill-used\r\nwretch was he, said he to himself, to have to rattle all over the country\r\nin such weather!\r\n\r\nHere was home at last.  How comfortable looked the bright light, as the\r\ncottage door was thrown open at the sound of the horse\'s feet!\r\n\r\n\'Well, Harold!\' cried Ellen eagerly, \'is anything the matter?\'\r\n\r\n\'No,\' he said, beginning to get sulky because he felt he was wrong; \'only\r\nPeggy lost a shoe--\'\r\n\r\n\'Lame?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, I took her to the smith.\'\r\n\r\n\'Give me Alfred\'s ointment, please, before you put her up.  He is in such\r\na way about it, and we can\'t put him to bed--\'\r\n\r\n\'Haven\'t got it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not got it!  O Harold!\'\r\n\r\n\'I should like to know how to be minding such things when pony loses a\r\nshoe, and such weather!  I declare I\'m as wet--!\' said Harold angrily, as\r\nhe saw his sister clasp her hands in distress, and the tears come in her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\'Is Harold come safe?\' called Mrs. King from above.\r\n\r\n\'Is the ointment come?\' cried Alfred, in a piteous pain-worn voice.\r\n\r\nHarold stamped his foot, and bolted to the stable to put the pony away.\r\n\r\n\'It\'s not come,\' said Ellen, coming up-stairs, very sadly.\r\n\r\n\'He has forgot it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Forgot it!\' cried Alfred, raising himself passionately.  \'He always does\r\nforget everything!  He don\'t care for me one farthing!  I believe he\r\nwants me dead!\'\r\n\r\n\'This is very bad of him!  I didn\'t think he\'d have done it,\' said Mrs.\r\nKing sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s been loitering after some mischief,\' exclaimed Alfred.  \'Taking his\r\npleasure--and I must stay all this time in pain!  Serve him right to send\r\nhim back to Elbury.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. King had a great mind to have done so; but when she looked at the\r\ntorrents of rain that streamed against the window, and thought how wet\r\nHarold must be already, and of the fatal illnesses that had been begun by\r\nbeing exposed to such weather, she was afraid to venture a boy with such\r\na family constitution, and turning back to Alfred, she said, \'I am very\r\nsorry, Alfred, but it can\'t be helped; I can\'t send Harold out in the\r\nrain again, or we shall have him ill too.\'\r\n\r\nPoor Alfred! it was no trifle to have suffered all day, and to be told\r\nthe pain must go on all night.  His patience and all his better thoughts\r\nwere quite worn away, and he burst into tears of anger and cried out that\r\nit was very hard--his mother cared for Harold more than for him, and\r\nnobody minded it, if he lay in such pain all night.\r\n\r\n\'You know better than that, dear,\' said his poor mother, sadly grieved,\r\nbut bearing it meekly.  \'Harold shall go as soon as can be to-morrow.\'\r\n\r\n\'And what good will that be to-night?\' grumbled Alfred.  \'But you always\r\ndid put Harold before me.  However, I shall soon be dead and out of your\r\nway, that\'s all!\'\r\n\r\nMrs. King would not make any answer to this speech, knowing it only made\r\nhim worse.  She went down to see about Harold, an additional offence to\r\nAlfred, who muttered something about \'Mother and her darling.\'\r\n\r\n\'How can you, Alfred, speak so to Mother?\' cried Ellen.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure every one is cross enough to me,\' returned Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'Not Mother,\' said Ellen.  \'She couldn\'t help it.\'\r\n\r\n\'She won\'t send Harold out again, though; I\'m sure I\'d have gone for\r\nhim.\'\r\n\r\n\'You don\'t know what the rain was,\' said Ellen.\r\n\r\n\'Well, he should have minded; but you\'re all against me.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll be sorry by-and-by, Alfred; this isn\'t like the way you talk\r\nsometimes.\'\r\n\r\n\'Some one else had need to be sorry, not me.\'\r\n\r\nPerhaps, in the midst of his captious state, Alfred was somewhat pacified\r\nby hearing sounds below that made him certain that Harold was not\r\nescaping without some strong words from his mother.\r\n\r\nThey were not properly taken.  Harold was in no mood of repentance, and\r\nthe consciousness that he had been behaving most unkindly, only made him\r\nmore rough and self-justifying.\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t help it!  I can\'t be a slave to run about everywhere, and\r\nremember everything--pony losing her shoe, and nigh tumbling down with\r\nme, and Ross at the post so cross for nothing!\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll grieve at the way you have used your poor brother one of these\r\ndays, Harold,\' quietly answered his mother, so low, that Alfred could not\r\nhear through the floor.  \'Now, you\'ll please to go to bed.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ain\'t I to have no supper?\' said Harold in a sullen voice, with a great\r\nmind to sit down in the chimney-corner in defiance.\r\n\r\n\'I shall give you something hot when you are in bed.  If I treated you as\r\nyou deserve, I should send you to Mr. Blunt\'s this moment; but I can\'t\r\nafford to have you ill too, so go to bed this moment.\'\r\n\r\nHis mother could still master him by her steadiness and he went up,\r\nmuttering that he\'d no notion of being treated like a baby, and that he\r\nwould soon shew her the difference: he wasn\'t going to be made a slave to\r\nAlfred, and \'twas all a fuss about that stuff!\r\n\r\nHe did fancy he said his prayers; but they could not have been real ones,\r\nfor he was no softer when his mother came to his bedside with a great\r\nbasin of hot gruel.  He said he hated such nasty sick stuff, and grunted\r\nsavagely when, with a look that ought to have gone to his heart, she\r\nasked if he thought he deserved anything better.\r\n\r\nYet she did not know of the shooting gallery, nor of his false excuses.\r\nIf he had not been deceiving her, perhaps he might have been touched.\r\n\r\n\'Well, Harold,\' she said at last, after taking the empty basin from him,\r\nand picking up his wet clothes and boots to dry them by the fire, \'I hope\r\nas you lie there you\'ll come to a better mind.  It makes me afraid for\r\nyou, my boy.  It is not only your brother you are sinning against, but if\r\nyou are a bad boy, you know Who will be angry with you.  Good-night.\'\r\n\r\nShe lingered, but Harold was still hard, and would neither own himself\r\nsorry, nor say good-night.\r\n\r\nWhen she passed his bed at the top of the stairs again, after hanging up\r\nthe things by the fire, he had his head hidden, and either was, or\r\nfeigned to be, asleep.\r\n\r\nAlfred\'s ill-temper was nearly gone, but he still thought himself\r\ngrievously injured, and was at no pains to keep himself from groaning and\r\nmoaning all the time he was being put to bed.  In fact, he rather liked\r\nto make the most of it, to shew his mother how provoking she was, and to\r\nreproach Harold for his neglect.\r\n\r\nThe latter purpose he did not effect; Harold heard every sound, and\r\nconsoled himself by thinking what an intolerable work Alfred was making\r\non purpose.  If he had tried to bear it as well as possible, his brother\r\nwould have been much more likely to be sorry.\r\n\r\nAlfred was thinking too much about his misfortunes and discomforts to\r\nattend to the evening reading, but it soothed him a little, and the pain\r\nwas somewhat less, so he did fall asleep, so uneasily though, that Mrs.\r\nKing put off going to bed as late as she could.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly eleven, and Ellen had been in bed a long time, when Alfred\r\nstarted, and Mrs. King turned her head, at the click of the wicket gate,\r\nand a step plashing on the walk.  She opened the little window, and the\r\ngust of wet wind puffed the curtains, whistled round the room, and almost\r\nblew out the candle.\r\n\r\n\'Who\'s there?\r\n\r\n\'It\'s me, Mrs. King!  I\'ve got the stuff,\' called a hoarse tired voice.\r\n\r\n\'Well, if ever!  It\'s Paul Blackthorn!\' exclaimed Mrs. King.  \'Thank ye\r\nkindly.  I\'ll come and let you in.\'\r\n\r\n\'Paul Blackthorn!\' cried Alfred.  \'Been all the way to Elbury for me!  O\r\nMother, bring him up, and let me thank him!  But how ever did he know?\'\r\nThe tears came running down Alfred\'s cheeks at such kindness from a\r\nstranger.  Mrs. King had hurried down-stairs, and at the threshold stood\r\na watery figure, holding out the gallipot.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! thank you, thank you; but come in!  Yes, come in! you must have\r\nsomething hot, and get dried.\'\r\n\r\nPaul shambled in very foot-sore.  He looked as if he were made of moist\r\nmud, and might be squeezed into any shape, and streams of rain were\r\ndropping from each of his many rags.\r\n\r\n\'Well, I don\'t know how to thank you--such a night!  But he\'ll sleep easy\r\nnow.  How did you come to think of it?\'\r\n\r\n\'I was just coming home from the parson\'s, and I met Harold putting up\r\nPeggy, in a great way because he\'d forgotten.  That\'s all, Missus,\' said\r\nPaul, looking shamefaced.  \'Good-night to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no, that won\'t do.  I must have you sit down and get dry,\' said Mrs.\r\nKing, nursing up the remains of the fire; and as Paul\'s day-garments\r\nserved him for night-gear likewise, he could hardly help accepting the\r\ninvitation, and spreading his chilled hands to the fire.\r\n\r\nAs to Mrs. King\'s feelings, it must be owned that, grateful as she was,\r\nit was rather like sitting opposite to the heap in the middle of Mr.\r\nShepherd\'s farm-yard.\r\n\r\n\'Would you take that?\' she said, holding out a three-penny piece.  \'I\'d\r\nmake it twice as much if I could, but times are hard.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no, Missus, I didn\'t do it for that,\' said Paul, putting it aside.\r\n\r\n\'Then you must have some supper, that I declare.\'\r\n\r\nAnd she brought out a slice of cold bacon, and some bread, and warmed\r\nsome beer at the fire.  She would go without bacon and beer herself to-\r\nmorrow, but that was nothing to her.  It was a real pleasure to see the\r\ncolour come into Paul\'s bony yellow cheeks at the hearty meal, which he\r\ncould not refuse; but he did not speak much, for he was tired out, and\r\nthe fire and the beer were making him very sleepy.\r\n\r\nAlfred rapped above with the stick that served as a bell.  It was to beg\r\nthat Paul would come and be thanked; and though Mrs. King was a little\r\nafraid of the experiment, she did ask him to walk up for a moment.\r\n\r\nGrunt went he, and in rather an unmannerly way, he said, \'I\'d rather\r\nnot.\'\r\n\r\n\'Pray do,\' said Mrs. King; \'I don\'t think Alfred will sleep easy without\r\nsaying thank you.\'\r\n\r\nSo Paul complied, and in a most ungainly fashion clumped up-stairs and\r\nstood at the door.  He had not forgotten his last reception, and would\r\nnot come a step farther, though Alfred stretched out his hand and begged\r\nhim to come in.\r\n\r\nAlfred could say only \'Thank you, I never thought any one would be so\r\nkind.\'\r\n\r\nAnd Paul made gruff reply, \'Ye\'re very welcome,\' turned about as if he\r\nwere running away, and tumbled down-stairs, and out of the house, without\r\neven answering Mrs. King\'s \'Good-night.\'\r\n\r\nHarold had wakened at the sounds.  He heard all, but he chose to seem to\r\nbe asleep, and, would you believe it? he was only the more provoked!\r\nPaul\'s exertion made his neglect seem all the worse, and he was\r\npositively angry with him for \'going and meddling, and poking his nose\r\nwhere he\'d no concern.  Now he shouldn\'t be able to get the stuff\r\nto-morrow, and so make it up; and of course mother would go and dock\r\nPaul\'s supper out of his dinner!\'\r\n\r\nIf such reflections were going on upon one side of the partition, there\r\nwere very different thoughts upon the other.  The stranger\'s kindness had\r\ndone more than relieve Alfred\'s pain: the warm sense of thankfulness had\r\nsoftened his spirit, and carried off his selfish fit.  He knew not how\r\nkind people were to him, and how ungrateful he had been to punish his\r\ninnocent mother and sister, and so much to magnify a bit of\r\nthoughtlessness on Harold\'s part; to be angry with his mother for not\r\ndriving him out when she thought it might endanger his health and life,\r\nand to say such cruel things on purpose to wound her.  Alfred felt\r\nhimself far more cruel than he had even thought Harold.\r\n\r\nAnd was this his resolution?  Was this the shewing the sincerity of his\r\nrepentance through his conduct in illness?  Was this patience?  Was it\r\nbrotherly love?  Was it the taking up the cross so as to bear it like his\r\nSaviour, Who spoke no word of complaining, no murmur against His\r\ntormentors?\r\n\r\nHow he had fallen!  How he had lost himself!  It was a bitter distress,\r\nand threw him almost into despair.  He prayed over and over to be\r\nforgiven, and began to long for some assurance of pardon, and for\r\nsomething to prevent all his right feelings and wishes from thus seeming\r\nto slip away from his grasp at the first trial.\r\n\r\nHe told his mother how sorry he was; and she answered, \'Dear lad, don\'t\r\nfret about it.  It was very hard for you to bear, and you are but\r\nlearning, you see, to be patient.\'\r\n\r\n\'But I\'m not learning if I don\'t go on no better,\' sighed Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'By bits you are, my boy,\' she said; \'you are much less fractious now\r\nthan you used to be, only you could not stand this out-of-the-way trial.\'\r\n\r\nAlfred groaned.\r\n\r\n\'Do you remember what our Saviour said to St. Peter?\' said his mother;\r\n\'"Whither I go thou canst not follow Me now, but thou shalt follow Me\r\nafterwards."  You see, St. Peter couldn\'t bear his cross then, but he\r\nwent on doing his best, and grieving when he failed, and by-and-by he did\r\nbear it almost like his Master.  He got to be made strong out of\r\nweakness.\'\r\n\r\nThere was some comfort to Alfred in this; but he feared, and yet longed,\r\nto see Mr. Cope, and when he came, had scarcely answered his questions as\r\nto how he felt, before he said, \'O Sir, I\'ve been a bad boy again, and so\r\ncross to them all!\'\r\n\r\n\'O Sir,\' said Ellen, who could not bear for him to blame himself, \'I\'m\r\nsure it was no wonder--he\'s so distracted with the pain, and Harold\r\ngetting idling, and forgetting to bring him the ointment.  Why, even that\r\nvagabond boy was so shocked, that he went all the way to Elbury that very\r\nnight for it.  I told Alfred you\'d tell him that anybody would be put\r\nout, and nobody would think of minding what he said.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nobody, especially so kind a sister,\' said Mr. Cope, smiling; \'but that\r\nis not what Alfred is thinking of.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Sir,\' said Alfred; \'their being so good to me makes it all the\r\nworse.\'\r\n\r\n\'I quite believe so; and you are very much disappointed in yourself.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, Sir, just when I wanted to be getting patient, and more like--\'\r\nand his eyes turned to the little picture, and filled with tears.\r\n\r\nMr. Cope said somewhat of what his mother had said that he was but a\r\nscholar in patience, and that he must take courage, though he had\r\nslipped, and pray for new strengthening and refreshing to go on in the\r\npath of pain his Lord had hallowed for him.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the words reminded Alfred of the part of the Catechism where they\r\noccur, for he said, \'Oh, I wish I was confirmed!  If I could but take the\r\nHoly Sacrament, to make me stronger, and sure of being forgiven--\'\r\n\r\n\'You shall--before--\' said Mr. Cope, speaking eagerly, but becoming\r\nchoked as he went on.  \'You are one whom the Church would own as ready\r\nand desirous to come, though you cannot be confirmed.  You should at\r\nonce--but you see I am not yet a priest; I have not the power to\r\nadminister the Holy Communion; but I trust I shall be one in the spring,\r\nand then, Alfred--Or if you should be worse, I promise you that I would\r\nbring some one here.  You shall not go without the Bread of Life.\'\r\n\r\nAlfred felt what he said to the depths of his heart, but he could not say\r\nanything but \'Thank you, Sir.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Cope, still much moved, laid his hand upon that of the boy.  \'So,\r\nAlfred, we prepare together.  As I hope and long to prepare myself to\r\nhave that great charge committed to me, which our Saviour Christ gave to\r\nHis Apostles; so you prepare for the receiving of that Bread and that Cup\r\nwhich will more fully unite you to Him, and join your suffering to what\r\nHe bore for you.\'\r\n\r\n\'How shall I, Sir?\' murmured Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'I will do my best to shew you,\' said Mr. Cope; \'but your Catechism tells\r\nyou best.  Think over that last answer.\'\r\n\r\nAlfred\'s face lighted sweetly as he went over it.  \'Why, that\'s what I\r\ncan\'t help doing, Sir; I can\'t forget my faults, I\'m so afraid of them;\r\nand I\'m sure I do want to lead a new life, if I didn\'t keep on being so\r\nbad; and thinking about His dying is the best comfort I have.  Nor I\'m\r\nsure I don\'t bear ill-will to nobody, only I suppose it is not charity to\r\nrun out at poor Mother and Ellen when one\'s put out.\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps that is what you want to learn,\' said Mr. Cope, \'and to get all\r\nthese feelings deepened, and more earnest and steadfast.  If the long\r\nwaiting does that for you, it will be good, and keep you from coming\r\nlightly to the Holy Feast.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, I could not do that!\' exclaimed Alfred.  \'And may I think that all\r\nmy faults will be taken away and forgiven?\'\r\n\r\n\'All you repent of, and bring in faith--\'\r\n\r\n\'That is what they say at church in the Absolution,\' said Alfred\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\'Rather it is what the priest says to them,\' said Mr. Cope; \'it is the\r\napplying the promise of forgiveness that our Saviour bought.  I may not\r\nyet say those words with authority, Alfred, but I should like to hope\r\nthat some day I may speak them to you, and bring rest from the weight at\r\nyour heart.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh!  I hope I may live to that!\' said Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'You shall hear them, whether from me or from another,\' said Mr. Cope,\r\n\'that is, if God will grant us warning.  But you need not fear, Alfred,\r\nif you thoroughly repent, and put your full faith in the great Sacrifice\r\nthat has been offered for your sins and the sins of all the world.  God\r\nwill take care of His child, and you already have His promise that He\r\nwill give you all that is needful for your salvation.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII--CONFIRMATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Harold had known all the consequences of his neglect, perhaps he would\r\nhave been more sorry for it than as yet he had chosen to be.\r\n\r\nThe long walk and the warm beer and fire sent Paul to his hay-nest so\r\nheavy with sleep, that he never stirred till next morning he was wakened\r\nby Tom Boldre, the shuffler, kicking him severely, and swearing at him\r\nfor a lazy fellow, who stayed out at night and left him to do his work.\r\n\r\nPaul stumbled to his feet, quite confused by the pain, and feeling for\r\nhis shoes in the dark loft.  The shuffler scarcely gave him an instant to\r\nput them on, but hunted him down-stairs, telling him the farmer was\r\nthere, and he would catch it.\r\n\r\nIt would do nobody any good to hear the violent way in which Mr. Shepherd\r\nabused the boy.  He was a passionate man, and no good labourers liked to\r\nwork with him because of his tongue.  With such grown men as he had, he\r\nwas obliged to keep himself under some restraint, but this only incited\r\nhim to make up for it towards the poor friendless boy.\r\n\r\nIt was really nearly eight o\'clock, and Paul\'s work had been neglected,\r\nwhich was enough to cause displeasure; and besides, Boldre had heard Paul\r\ncoming home past eleven, and the farmer insisted on knowing what he had\r\nbeen doing.\r\n\r\nUnder all his rags, Paul was a very proud boy, and thus asked, he would\r\nnot tell, but stood with his legs twisted, looking very sulky.\r\n\r\n\'No use asking him,\' cried Mrs. Shepherd\'s shrill voice at the back door;\r\n\'why, don\'t ye hear that Mrs. Barker\'s hen-roost has been robbed by Dick\r\nRoyston and two or three more on \'em?\'\r\n\r\n\'I never robbed!\' cried Paul indignantly.\r\n\r\n\'None of your jaw,\' said the farmer angrily.  \'If you don\'t tell me this\r\nmoment where you\'ve been, off you go this instant.  Drinking at the\r\nTankard, I\'ll warrant.\'\r\n\r\n\'No such thing, Sir,\' said Paul.  \'I went to Elbury after some medicine\r\nfor a sick person.\'\r\n\r\nSomehow he had a feeling about the house opposite, which would not let\r\nhim come out with the name in such a scene.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s all stuff,\' broke in Mrs. Shepherd, \'I don\'t believe one word of\r\nit!  Send him off; take my advice, Farmer, let him go where he comes\r\nfrom; Ellen King told me he was out of prison.\'\r\n\r\nPaul flushed crimson at this, and shook all over.  He had all but turned\r\nto go, caring for nothing more at Friarswood; but just then, John Farden,\r\none of the labourers, who was carrying out some manure, called out, \'No,\r\nno, Ma\'am.  Sure enough he did go to Elbury to Dr. Blunt\'s.  I was on the\r\nroad myself, and I hears him.  "Good-night," says I.  "Good-night," says\r\nhe.  "Where be\'est going?" says I.  "To doctor\'s," says he, "arter some\r\nstuff for Alfred King."\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Paul, speaking more to Farden than to his master, \'and then\r\nMrs. King gave me some supper, and that was what made me so late.\'\r\n\r\n\'She ought to be ashamed of herself, then,\' said Mrs. Shepherd\r\nspitefully, \'having a vagabond scamp like that drinking beer at her house\r\nat that time of night.  How one is deceived in folks!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, what are you doing here?\' cried the farmer, turning on Paul\r\nangrily; \'d\'ye mean to waste any more of the day?\'\r\n\r\nSo Paul was not turned off, and had to go straight to his work.  It was\r\nwell he had had so good a supper, for he had not a moment to snatch a bit\r\nof breakfast.  It so happened that his work was to go with John Farden,\r\nwho was carrying out the manure in the cart.  Paul had to hold the horse,\r\nwhile John forked it out into little heaps in the field.  John was a\r\ngreat big powerful man, with a foolish face, not a good workman, nor a\r\ngood character, or he would not have been at that farm.  He had either\r\nnever been taught anything, or had forgotten it all; he never went near\r\nchurch; he had married a disreputable wife, and had two or three unruly\r\nchildren, who were likely to be the plagues of their parents and the\r\nparish, but not a whit did John heed; he did not seem to have much more\r\nsense than to work just enough to get food, lodging, beer, and tobacco,\r\nto sleep all night, and doze all Sunday.  There was not any malice nor\r\ndishonesty in him; but it was terrible that a man with an immortal soul\r\nshould live so nearly the life of the brute beasts that have no\r\nunderstanding, and should never wake to the sense of God or of eternity.\r\n\r\nHe was not a man of many words, and nothing passed for a long time but\r\nshouts of hoy, and whoa, and the like, to the horse.  Paul went heavily\r\non, scarce knowing what he was about; there was a stunned jaded feel\r\nabout him, as if he were hunted and driven about, a mere outcast,\r\ndespised by every one, even by the Kings, whose kindness had been his\r\nonly ray of brightness.  Not that his senses or spirits were alive enough\r\neven to be conscious of pain or vexation; it was only a dull dreary\r\nheedlessness what became of him next; and, quick clever boy as he had\r\nbeen in the Union, he did not seem to have a bit more sense, thought, or\r\nfeeling, than John Farden.\r\n\r\nJohn Farden was the first to break the silence: \'I wouldn\'t bide,\' said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\nPaul looked up, and muttered, \'I have nowhere to go.\'\r\n\r\n\'Farmer uses thee shameful,\' repeated John.  \'Why don\'t thee cut?\'\r\n\r\nPaul saw the smoke of Mrs. King\'s chimney.  That had always seemed like a\r\nfriend to him, but it came across him that they too thought him a runaway\r\nfrom prison, and he felt as if his only bond of fellowship was gone.  But\r\nthere was something else, too; and he made answer, \'I\'ll bide for the\r\nConfirmation.\'\r\n\r\n\'Eh?\' said John, \'what good\'ll that do ye?\'\r\n\r\n\'Help me to be a good lad,\' said Paul, who knew John Farden would not\r\nenter into any other explanation.\r\n\r\n\'Why, what\'ll they do to ye?\'\r\n\r\n\'The Bishop will put his hand on me and bless me,\' said Paul; and as he\r\nsaid the words there was hope and refreshment coming back.  He was a\r\nchild of God, if no other owned him.\r\n\r\n\'Whoy,\' said Farden, much as he might have spoken to his horse, \'rum sort\r\nof a head thou\'st got!  Thee\'ll never go up to Bishop such a guy!\'\r\n\r\n\'Can\'t help it,\' said Paul rather sullenly; \'it ain\'t the clothes that\r\nGod looks at.\'\r\n\r\nJohn scanned him all over, with his face looking more foolish than ever\r\nin the puzzle he felt.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' he said, \'and what wilt get by it?\'\r\n\r\n\'God\'s grace to do right, I hope,\' said Paul; then he added, out of his\r\nsad heart, \'It\'s bad enough here, to be sure.  It would be a bad look-out\r\nif one hoped for nothing afterwards.\'\r\n\r\nSomehow John\'s mind didn\'t take in the notion of afterwards, and he did\r\nnot go on talking to Paul.  Perhaps there was a dread in his poor dull\r\nmind of getting frightened out of the deadly stupefied sleep it was bound\r\nin.\r\n\r\nBut that bit of talk had done Paul great good, by rousing him to the\r\nthought of what he had to hope for.  There was the Confirmation nigh at\r\nhand, and then on beyond there was rest; and the words came into his\r\nmind, \'There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at\r\nrest.\'\r\n\r\nPoor, poor boy!  He was very young to have such yearnings towards the\r\ngrave, and well-nigh to wish he lay as near to it as Alfred King, so he\r\nmight have those loving tender hands near him, those kind voices round\r\nhim.  Paul had gone through a great deal in these few months; and, used\r\nto good shelter and regular meals, he was less inured to bodily hardship\r\nthan many a cottage boy.  His utter neglect of his person was telling on\r\nhim; he was less healthy and strong than he had been, and though high\r\nspirits, merriment, and the pleasure of freedom and independence, had\r\nmade all light to him in the summer, yet now the cold weather, with his\r\ninsufficient food and scanty clothing, was dulling him and deadening him,\r\nand hard work and unkind usage seemed to be grinding his very senses\r\ndown.  To be sure, when twelve o\'clock came, he went up into the loft,\r\nate his bit of dry bread, and said his prayers, as he had not been able\r\nto do in the morning, and that made him feel less forlorn and downcast\r\nfor a little while; but then as he sat, he grew cold, and numb, and\r\nsleepy, and seemed to have no life in him, but to be moving like a horse\r\nin a mill, when Boldre called him down, and told him not to be idling\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe theft in Mrs. Barker\'s poultry-yard was never traced home to any one,\r\nbut the world did not the less believe Dick Royston and Jesse Rolt to\r\nhave been concerned in it.  Indeed, they had been drinking up some of\r\ntheir gains when Harold met them at the shooting-gallery: and Mrs.\r\nShepherd would not put it out of her head that Paul Blackthorn was in the\r\nsecret, and that if he did really go for the medicine as he said, it was\r\nonly as an excuse for carrying the chickens to some receiver of stolen\r\ngoods.  She had no notion of any person doing anything out of pure love\r\nand pity.  Moreover, it is much easier to put a suspicion into people\'s\r\nheads than out again; and if Paul\'s whole history and each day\'s doings\r\nhad been proved to her in a court of justice, she would still have\r\nchiefly remembered that she had always thought ill of him, and that Ellen\r\nKing had said he was a runaway convict, and so she would have believed\r\nhim to the end.\r\n\r\nEllen had long ago forgotten that she had said anything of the kind; and\r\nthough she still held her nose rather high when Paul was near, she would\r\nhave answered for his honesty as readily as for that of her own brothers.\r\nBut hers had not been the charity that thinketh no evil, and her idle\r\nwords had been like thistle-down, lightly sent forth, but when they had\r\nlighted, bearing thorns and prickles.\r\n\r\nThose thorns were galling poor Paul.  Nobody could guess what his\r\nglimpses of that happy, peaceful, loving family were to him.  They seemed\r\nto him like a softer, better kind of world, and he looked at their fair\r\nfaces and fresh, well-ordered garments with a sort of reverence; a kind\r\nlook or greeting from Mrs. King, a mere civil answer from Ellen, those\r\ntwo sights of the white spirit-looking Alfred, were like the rays of\r\nlight that shone into his dark hay-loft.  Sometimes he heard them singing\r\ntheir hymns and psalms on a Sunday evening, and then the tears would come\r\ninto his eyes as he leant over the gate to listen.  And, as if it was\r\nbecause Ellen kept at the greatest distance from him, he set more store\r\nby her words and looks than those of any one else, was always glad when\r\nshe served him in the shop, and used to watch her on Sunday, looking as\r\nfresh as a flower in her neat plain dress.\r\n\r\nAnd now to hear that she not only thought meanly of him, which he knew\r\nwell enough, but thought him a thief, a runaway, and an impostor coming\r\nabout with false tales, was like a weight upon his sunken spirits, and\r\nseemed to take away all the little heart hard usage had left him, made\r\nhim feel as if suspicious eyes were on him whenever he went for his bit\r\nof bread, and took away all his peace in looking at the cottage.\r\n\r\nHe did once take courage to say to Harold, \'Did your sister really say I\r\nhad run away from gaol?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, nobody minds what our Ellen says,\' was the answer.\r\n\r\n\'But did she say so?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know, I dare say she did.  She\'s so fine, that she thinks no one\r\nthat comes up-stairs in dirty shoes worth speaking to.  I\'m sure she\'s\r\nthe plague of my life--always at me.\'\r\n\r\nThat was not much comfort for Paul.  He had other friends, to be sure.\r\nAll the boys in the place liked him, and were very angry with the way the\r\nfarmer treated him, and greatly to their credit, they admired his\r\nsuperior learning instead of being jealous of it.  Mrs. Hayward, the\r\nsexton\'s wife, the same who had bound up his hand when he cut it at\r\nharvest, even asked him to come in and help her boys in the evenings with\r\nwhat they had to prepare for Mr. Cope.  He was not sorry to do so\r\nsometimes.  The cottage was a slatternly sort of place, where he did not\r\nfeel ashamed of himself, and the Haywards were mild good sort of folks,\r\nfrom whom he was sure never to hear either a bad or an unkind word;\r\nthough he did not care for them, nor feel refreshed and helped by being\r\nwith them as he did with the Kings.\r\n\r\nJohn Farden, too, was good-natured to him, and once or twice hindered\r\nBoldre from striking or abusing him; he offered him a pipe once, but Paul\r\ncould not smoke, and another time brought him out a pint of beer into the\r\nfield.  Mrs. Shepherd spied him drinking it from her upper window, and\r\nbelieved all the more that he got money somehow, and spent it in drink.\r\n\r\nSo the time wore on till the Confirmation, all seeming like one dull\r\nheavy dream of bondage; and as the weather became colder, the poor boy\r\nseemed to have no power of thinking of anything, but of so getting\r\nthrough his work as to avoid violence, to keep himself from perishing\r\nwith cold, and not to hurt his chilblains more than he could help.\r\n\r\nAll his quick intellect and good instruction seemed to have perished\r\naway, and the last time he went to Mr. Cope\'s, he sat as if he were\r\nstupid or asleep, and when a question came to him, sat with his mouth\r\nopen like silly Bill Pridden.\r\n\r\nMr. Cope knew him too well not to feel, as he wrote the ticket, that\r\nthere were very few of whom he could so entirely from his heart say\r\n\'Examined and APPROVED,\' as the poor lonely outcast foundling, Paul\r\nBlackthorn, who could not even tell whether he were fifteen, sixteen, or\r\nseventeen, but could just make sure that he had once been caned by old\r\nMr. Haynes, who went away from the Union twelve years ago.\r\n\r\n\'Do you think you can keep the ticket safe if I give it you now, Paul?\'\r\nasked Mr. Cope, recollecting that the cows might sup upon it like his\r\nPrayer-book.\r\n\r\nPaul put his hands down to the bottom of his pockets.  They were all one\r\nhole, and that sad lost foolish look came over his wan face again, and\r\nstartled Mr. Cope.\r\n\r\nThe boys grinned, but Charles Hayward stepped forward.  \'Please, Sir, let\r\nme take care of it for him.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Cope and Paul both agreed, and Mr. Cope kept Charles for a moment to\r\nsay, as he gave him a shilling, \'Look here, Charles, do you think you can\r\nmanage to get that poor fellow a tolerable breakfast on Saturday before\r\nhe goes?  And if you could make him look a little more decent?\'\r\n\r\nCharles pulled his forelock and looked knowing.  In fact, there was a\r\nlittle plot among these good-natured boys, and Harold King was in it too,\r\nthough he was not of the Confirmation party, and said and thought he was\r\nvery glad of it.  He did not want to bind himself to be so very good.\r\nSilly boy; as if Baptism had not bound him already!\r\n\r\nMrs. Hayward put her head out as Paul passed her cottage, and called out,\r\n\'I say, you Paul, you come in to-morrow evening with our Charlie and Jim,\r\nand I\'ll wash you when I washes them.\'\r\n\r\nGood Mrs. Hayward made a mistake that the more delicate-minded Mrs. King\r\nwould never have made.  Perhaps if a pail of warm water and some soap had\r\nbeen set before Paul, he might actually have washed himself; but he was\r\nmuch too big and too shamefaced a lad to fancy sharing a family scrubbing\r\nby a woman, whatever she might do to her own sons.  But considering the\r\nsize of the Hayward cottage, and the way in which the family lived, this\r\nsort of notion was not likely to come into the head of the good-natured\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nSo she and her boys were much vexed when Paul did not make his\r\nappearance, and she made a face of great disgust when Charles said,\r\n\'Never mind, Mother, my white frock will hide no end of dirt.\'\r\n\r\n\'I shall have to wash it over again before you can wear it, I know,\' said\r\nMrs. Hayward.  \'Not as I grudges the trouble; he\'s a poor lost orphant,\r\nthat it\'s a shame to see so treated.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. Hayward did not know that she was bestowing the cup of cold water,\r\nas well as being literally ready to wash the feet of the poor disciple.\r\n\r\nA clean body is a type and token of a pure mind; and though the lads of\r\nFriarswood did not quite perceive this, there was a feeling about them of\r\nthere being something unnatural and improper, and a disgrace to\r\nFriarswood, in any one going up to the Bishop in such a condition as\r\nPaul.  Especially, as Charles Hayward said, when he was the pick of the\r\nwhole lot.  Perhaps Charles was right, for surely Paul was single-hearted\r\nin his hope of walking straight to his one home, Heaven, and he had been\r\ndoing no other than bearing his cross, when he so patiently took the\r\nbeing \'buffeted\' when he did well, and faithfully served his froward\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nBut Paul was not to escape the outward cleansing, and from one of the\r\nvery last people from whom it would have been expected.  He had just\r\npulled his bed of hay down over him, and was trying to curl himself up so\r\nas to stop his teeth from chattering, with Caesar on his feet, when the\r\ndog growled, and a great voice lowered to a gruff whisper, said, \'Come\r\nalong, young un!\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m coming,\' cried Paul.\r\n\r\nThough it was not Boldre\'s voice, it had startled him terribly; he was so\r\nmuch used to ill-treatment, that he expected a savage blow every moment.\r\n\r\nBut the great hand that closed on him, though rough, was not unkind.\r\n\r\n\'Poor lad, how he quakes!\' said John Farden\'s voice.  \'Don\'t ye be\r\nafeard, it\'s only me.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nobody got at the horses?\' cried Paul.\r\n\r\n\'No, no; only I ain\'t going to have you going up to yon big parson all\r\none muck-heap!  Come on, and make no noise about it.\'\r\n\r\nPaul did not very well know what was going to befall him, but he did not\r\nfeel unsafe with John Farden, and besides, his lank frame was in the\r\ngrasp of that big hand like a mouse in the power of a mastiff.  So he let\r\nhimself be hauled down the ladder, into an empty stall, where, behold,\r\nthere was a dark lantern (which had been at bad work in its time), a\r\npail, a brush, a bit of soap, and a ragged towel.\r\n\r\nJohn laid hold of him much as Alfred in his page days used to do of Lady\r\nJane\'s little dog when it had to be washed, but Puck had the advantage in\r\nkeeping on his shaggy coat all the time, and in being more gently\r\nhandled, whereas Farden scrubbed with such hearty good-will, that Paul\r\nthought his very skin would come off.  But he had undergone the like in\r\nthe workhouse, and he knew how to accommodate himself to it; and when his\r\nrough bath was over, though he was very sore, and stiff, and chilly, he\r\nreally felt relieved, and more respectable than he had done for many\r\nmonths, only rather sorry he must put on his filthy old rags again; and\r\nhe gave honest John more thanks than might have been expected.\r\n\r\nThe Confirmation was to be at eleven o\'clock, at Elbury, and John had\r\nundertaken his morning\'s work, so that Mr. Shepherd grudgingly consented\r\nto spare him, knowing that all the other farmers of course did the same,\r\nand that there would be a cry of shame if he did not.\r\n\r\nPaul had just found his way down the ladder in the morning, with thoughts\r\ngoing through his mind that to him this would be the coming of the\r\nComforter, and he was sure he wanted comfort; and that for some hours of\r\nthis day at least, he should be at peace from rude words and blows, when\r\nhe heard a great confusion of merry voices and suppressed laughing, and\r\nsaw the heads of some of the lads bobbing about near Mrs. King\'s garden.\r\n\r\nWas it time already to set off, he wondered, looking up to the sun; but\r\nthen those boys seemed to be in an uproarious state such as did not suit\r\nhis present mood, nor did he think Mr. Cope would consider it befitting.\r\nHe would have let them go by, feeling himself such a scare-crow as they\r\nmight think a blot upon them; but he remembered that Charles Hayward had\r\nhis ticket, and as he looked at himself, he doubted whether he should be\r\nlet into a strange church.\r\n\r\n\'Paul!  Paul Blackthorn!\' called Harold, with a voice all aglee.\r\n\r\n\'Well!\' said Paul, \'what do you want of me?\'\r\n\r\n\'Come on, and you\'ll see.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t want a row.  Is Charlie Hayward there?  Just ask him for my\r\ncard, and don\'t make a work.\'\r\n\r\n\'He\'ll give it you if you\'ll come for it,\' said Harold; and seeing there\r\nwas no other chance, Paul slowly came.  Harold led him to the stable,\r\nwhere just within the door stood a knot of stout hearty boys, snorting\r\nwith fun, hiding their heads on each other\'s shoulders, and bending their\r\nbuskined knees with merriment.\r\n\r\n\'Now then!\' cried Charles Hayward, and he had got hold of the only button\r\nthat held Paul\'s coat together.\r\n\r\nPaul was bursting out with something, but George Grant\'s arms were round\r\nhis waist, and his hands were fumbling at his fastenings.  They were each\r\none much stronger than he was now, and they drowned his voice with shouts\r\nof laughter, while as fast as one garment was pulled off, another was put\r\non.\r\n\r\n\'Mind, you needn\'t make such a work, it bain\'t presents,\' said George\r\nGrant, \'only we won\'t have them asking up at Elbury if we\'ve saved the\r\nguy to bring in.\'\r\n\r\n\'It is a present, though, old Betty Bushel\'s shirt,\' said Charles\r\nHayward.  \'She said she\'d throw it at his head if he brought it back\r\nagain; but the frock\'s mine.\'\r\n\r\n\'And the corduroys is mine,\' said George Grant.  \'My! they be a sight too\r\nbig in the band!  Run in, Harold, and see if your mother can lend us a\r\npin.\'\r\n\r\n\'And the waistcoat is my summer one,\' said Fred Bunting.  \'He\'s too big\r\ntoo; why, Paul, you\'re no better than a natomy!\'\r\n\r\n\'Never mind, my white frock will hide it all,\' said Charles, \'and here\'s\r\nNed\'s cap for you.  Oh! and it\'s poor Alfred\'s boots.\'\r\n\r\nPaul could not make up his mind to walk all the way in the boots, but to\r\nsatisfy the boys he engaged to put them on as soon as they were getting\r\nto Elbury.\r\n\r\n\'My! he looks quite respectable,\' cried Charles, running back a little\r\nway to look at him.\r\n\r\n\'I wonder if Mr. Cope will know him?\' exclaimed Harold, jumping leap-frog\r\nfashion on George Grant\'s back.\r\n\r\n\'The maids will take him for some strange gentleman,\' exclaimed Jem\r\nHayward; \'and why, bless me, he\'s washed, I do declare!\' as a streak of\r\nlight from the door fell on Paul\'s visage.\r\n\r\n\'No, you don\'t mean it,\' broke out Charles.  \'Let\'s look! yes, I protest,\r\nwhy, the old grime between his eyes is gone after all.  How did you\r\nmanage that, Paul?\'\r\n\r\nPaul rather uneasily mumbled something about John Farden, and the boys\r\nclapped their hands, and shouted, so that Alfred, who well knew what was\r\ngoing on, raised himself on his pillow and laughed.  It was rather blunt\r\ntreatment for feelings if they were tender, but these were rough warm-\r\nhearted village boys, and it was all their good-nature.\r\n\r\n\'And where\'s the grub?\' asked Charles importantly, looking about.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, not far off,\' said Harold; and in another moment, he and Charles had\r\nbrought in a black coffee-pot, a large mug, some brown sugar, a hunch of\r\nbread, some butter, and a great big smoking sausage.\r\n\r\nPaul looked at it, as if he were not quite sure what to do with it.  One\r\nboy proceeded to turn in an inordinate quantity of sugar, another to pour\r\nin the brown coffee that sent out a refreshing steam enough to make any\r\none hungry.  George Grant spread the butter, cut the sausage in half, put\r\nit on the bread, and thrust it towards Paul.\r\n\r\n\'Eat it--s--s,\' said Charles, patting Paul on the back.  \'Mr. Cope said\r\nyou was to, and you must obey your minister.\'\r\n\r\n\'Not all for me?\' said Paul, not able to help a pull at the coffee, the\r\nmug warming his fingers the while.\r\n\r\n\'Oh yes, we\'ve all had our breakfastisses,\' said George Grant; \'we are\r\nonly come to make you eat yours like a good boy, as Mr. Cope said you\r\nshould.\'\r\n\r\nThey stood round, looking rather as they would have done had Paul been an\r\nelephant taking his meal in a show; but not one would hear of helping him\r\noff with a crumb out of Mr. Cope\'s shilling.  George Grant was a big\r\nhungry lad, and his breakfast among nine at home had not been much to\r\nspeak of; but savoury as was the sausage, and perfumy as was the coffee,\r\nhe would have scorned to take a fragment from that stranger, beg him to\r\ndo so as Paul might; and what could not be eaten at that time, with a\r\ngood pint of the coffee, was put aside in a safe nook in the stable to be\r\nwarmed up for supper.\r\n\r\nThat morning\'s work was not a bad preparation for Confirmation after all.\r\n\r\nHarold had stayed so long, that he had to jump on the pony and ride his\r\nfastest to be in time at the post.  He was very little ashamed of not\r\nbeing among those lads, and felt as if he had the more time to enjoy\r\nhimself; but there were those who felt very sad for him--Alfred, who\r\nwould have given so much to receive the blessing; and Ellen, whose\r\nconfirmation was very lonely and melancholy without either of her\r\nbrothers; besides his mother, to whom his sad carelessness was such\r\nconstant grief and heart-ache.\r\n\r\nEllen was called for by the carriage from the Grange, and sat up behind\r\nwith the kitchen-maid, who was likewise to be confirmed.  Little Miss\r\nJane sat inside in her white dress and veil, looking like a snowdrop,\r\nAlfred thought, as his mother lifted him up to the window to see her, as\r\nthe carriage stood still while Ellen climbed to her seat.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the morning, Mrs. King made time to read over the\r\nConfirmation Service with Alfred, to think of the blessing she was\r\nreceiving, and to pray that it might rest upon her through life.  And\r\nthey entreated, too, that Harold might learn to care for it, and be\r\nbrought to a better mind.\r\n\r\n\'O Mother,\' said Alfred, after lying thinking for sometime, \'if I thought\r\nHarold would take up for good and be a better boy to you than I have\r\nbeen, I should not mind anything so much.\'\r\n\r\nAnd there was Harold all the time wondering whether he should be able to\r\nget out in the evening to have a lark with Dick and Jesse.\r\n\r\nEllen was set down by-and-by.  Her colour was very deep, but she looked\r\ngentle and happy, and the first thing she did was to bend over Alfred,\r\nkiss him, and say how she wished he had been there.\r\n\r\nThen, when she had been into her own room, she came back and told them\r\nabout the beautiful large Elbury Church, and the great numbers of young\r\ngirls and boys on the two sides of the aisle, and of the Bishop seated in\r\nthe chair by the altar, and the chanted service, with the organ sounding\r\nso beautiful.\r\n\r\nAnd then how her heart had beat, and she hardly dared to speak her vow,\r\nand how she trembled when her turn came to go up to the rail, but she\r\nsaid it was so comfortable to see Mr. Cope in his surplice, looking so\r\nyoung among the other clergymen, and coming a little forward, as if to\r\ncount out and encourage his own flock.  She was less frightened when she\r\nhad met his kind eye, and was able to kneel down with a more quiet mind\r\nto receive the gift which had come down on the Day of Pentecost.\r\n\r\nAlfred wanted to know whether she had seen Paul, but Ellen had been\r\nkneeling down and not thinking of other people, when the Friarswood boys\r\nwent up.  Only she had passed him on the way home, and seen that though\r\nhe was lagging the last of the boys, he did not look dull and worn, as he\r\nhad been doing lately.\r\n\r\nEllen had been asked to go to the Grange after church to-morrow evening,\r\nand drink tea there, in celebration of the Confirmation which the two\r\nyoung foster-sisters had shared.\r\n\r\nHarold went to fetch her home at night, and they both came into the house\r\nfresh and glowing with the brisk frosty air, and also with what they had\r\nto tell.\r\n\r\n\'O mother, what do you think?  Paul Blackthorn is to go to the Grange to-\r\nmorrow.  My Lady wants to see him, and perhaps she will make Mr. Pound\r\nfind some work for him about the farm.\'\r\n\r\nHarold jumped up and snapped his fingers towards the farm.  \'There\'s for\r\nold Skinflint!\' said he; \'not a chap in the place but will halloo for\r\njoy!\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, I am glad!\' said Mrs. King; \'I didn\'t think that poor lad would\r\nhave held out much longer, winter weather and all.  But how did my Lady\r\ncome to hear of it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, it seems she noticed him going to church in all his rags, and Mr.\r\nCope told her who he was; so Miss Jane came and asked me all about him,\r\nand I told her what a fine scholar he is, and how shamefully the farmer\r\nand Boldre treat him, and how good he was to Alfred about the ointment,\r\nand how steady he is.  And I told her about the boys dressing him up\r\nyesterday, and how he wouldn\'t take a gift.  She listened just as if it\r\nwas a story, and she ran away to her grandmamma, and presently came back\r\nto say that the boy was to come up to-morrow after his work, for Lady\r\nJane to speak to him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, at least, he has been washed once,\' said Mrs. King; \'but he\'s so\r\nqueer; I hope he will have no fancies, and will behave himself.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'ll tackle him,\' declared Harold decidedly.  \'I\'ve a great mind to go\r\nout this moment and tell him.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. King prevented this; she persuaded Harold that Mrs. Shepherd would\r\nfly out at them if she heard any noise in the yard, and that it would be\r\nbetter for every one to let Paul alone till the morning.\r\n\r\nMorning came, and as soon as Harold was dressed, he rushed to the farm-\r\nyard, but he could not find Paul anywhere, and concluded that he had been\r\nsent out with the cows, and would be back by breakfast-time.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had brought home the post-bag, he dashed across the road\r\nagain, but came back in a few moments, looking beside himself.\r\n\r\n\'He\'s gone!\' he said, and threw himself back in a chair.\r\n\r\n\'Gone!\' cried Mrs. King and Ellen with one voice, quite aghast.\r\n\r\n\'Gone!\' repeated Harold.  \'The farmer hunted him off this morning!  Missus\r\nwill have it that he\'s been stealing her eggs, and that there was a\r\nlantern in the stable on Friday night; so they told him to be off with\r\nhim, and he\'s gone!\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor, poor boy! just when my Lady would have been the making of him!\'\r\ncried Ellen.\r\n\r\n\'But where--which way is he gone?\' asked Mrs. King.\r\n\r\n\'I might ride after him, and overtake him,\' cried Harold, starting up,\r\n\'but I never thought to ask!  And Mrs. Shepherd was ready to pitch into\r\nme, so I got away as soon as I could.  Do you run over and ask, Ellen;\r\nyou always were a favourite.\'\r\n\r\nThey were in such an eager state, that Ellen at once sprang up, and\r\nhastily throwing on her bonnet, ran across the road, and tapped at Mrs.\r\nShepherd\'s open door, exclaiming breathlessly, \'O Ma\'am, I beg your\r\npardon, but will you tell me where Paul Blackthorn is gone?\'\r\n\r\n\'Paul Blackthorn! how should I know?\' said Mrs. Shepherd crossly.  \'I\'m\r\nnot to be looking after thieves and vagabonds.  He\'s a come-by-chance,\r\nand he\'s a go-by-chance, and a good riddance too!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh but, Ma\'am, my Lady wanted to speak to him.\'\r\n\r\nThis only made Mrs. Shepherd the more set against the poor boy.\r\n\r\n\'Ay, ay, I know--coming over the gentry; and a good thing he\'s gone!\'\r\nsaid she.  \'The place isn\'t to be harbouring thieves and vagrants, or\r\nwho\'s to pay the rates?  My eggs are gone, I tell you, and who should\r\ntake \'em but that lad, I\'d like to know?\'\r\n\r\n\'Them was two rotten nest-eggs as I throwed away when I was cleaning the\r\nstable.\'\r\n\r\n\'Who told you to put in your word, John Farden?\' screamed Mrs. Shepherd,\r\nturning on him.  \'Ye\'d best mind what ye\'re about, or ye\'ll be after him\r\nsoon.\'\r\n\r\n\'No loss neither,\' muttered John, stopping to pick up his shovel.\r\n\r\n\'And you didn\'t see which way he was gone?\' asked Ellen, looking from the\r\nlabourer to the farmer\'s wife.\r\n\r\n\'Farmer sent un off or ever I come,\' replied John, \'or I\'d ha\' gied un a\r\nbreakfast.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure I can\'t tell,\' said Mrs. Shepherd, with a toss of her head.\r\n\'And as to you, Ellen King, I\'m surprised at you, running after a scamp\r\nlike that, that you told me yourself was out of a prison.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh but, Mrs. Shepherd--\'\r\n\r\n\'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\' interrupted Mrs. Shepherd; \'and I\r\nwonder your mother allows it.  But there\'s nothing like girls\r\nnow-a-days.\'\r\n\r\nEllen thought John Farden grinned; and feeling as if nothing so shocking\r\ncould ever happen to her again, she flew back, she hardly knew how, to\r\nher home, clapped the door after, and dropping into a chair as Harold had\r\ndone, burst into such a fit of crying, that she could not speak, and only\r\nshook her head in answer to Harold\'s questions as to how Paul was gone.\r\n\r\n\'Oh, no one knew!\' she choked out among her sobs; \'and Mrs. Shepherd--such\r\nthings!\'\r\n\r\nHarold stamped his foot, and Mrs. King tried to soothe her.  In the\r\nmidst, she recollected that she could not bear her brothers to guess at\r\nthe worst part of the \'such things;\' and recovering herself a moment, she\r\nsaid, \'No, no, they\'ve driven him off!  He\'s gone, and--and, oh!  Mother,\r\nMrs. Shepherd will have it he\'s a thief, and--and she says I said so.\'\r\n\r\nThat was bad enough, and Ellen wept bitterly again; while her mother and\r\nHarold both cried out with surprise.\r\n\r\n\'Yes--but--I did say I dare said he was out of a reformatory--and that\r\nshe should remember it!  Now I\'ve taken away his character, and he\'s a\r\npoor lost boy!\'\r\n\r\nOh, idle words! idle words!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX--ROBBING THE MAIL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no helping it!  People must have their letters whether Paul\r\nBlackthorn were lost or not, and Harold was a servant of the public, and\r\nmust do his duty, so after some exhortations from his mother, he ruefully\r\nrose up, hoping that he should not have to go to Ragglesford.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, you will,\' said his mother, \'and maybe to wait.  Here\'s a\r\nregistered letter, and I think there are two more with money in them.\'\r\n\r\n\'To think,\' sighed Harold, as he mounted his pony, \'of them little chaps\r\ngetting more money for nothing, than Paul did in a month by working the\r\nskin off his bones!\'\r\n\r\n\'Don\'t be discontented, Harold, on that score.  Them little chaps will\r\nwork hard enough by-and-by: and the money they have now is to train them\r\nin making a fit use of it then.\'\r\n\r\nHarold looked anxiously up and down the road for Paul, and asked Mr.\r\nCope\'s housekeeper whether he had been there to take leave.  No; and\r\nindeed Harold would have been a little vexed if he had wished good-bye\r\nanywhere if not at home.\r\n\r\nThere was a fine white frost, and the rime hung thickly on every spray of\r\nthe heavy branches of the dark firs and larches that overhung the long\r\nsolitary lane between the Grange and Ragglesford, and fringed the park\r\npalings with crystals.  Harold thought how cold poor Paul must be going\r\non his way in his ragged clothes.  The ice crackled under the pony\'s feet\r\nas she trotted down Ragglesford Lane, and the water of the ford looked so\r\ncold, that Peggy, a very wise animal, turned her head towards the foot-\r\nbridge, a narrow and not very sound affair, over which Harold had\r\nsometimes taken her when the stream was high, and threatened to be over\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\nHarold made no objection; but no sooner were all the pony\'s four hoofs\r\nwell upon the bridge, than at the other end appeared Dick Royston.\r\n\r\n\'Hollo, Har\'ld!\' was his greeting, \'I\'ve got somewhat to say to ye.\'\r\n\r\n\'D\'ye know where Paul Blackthorn is?\' asked Harold.\r\n\r\n\'Not I--I\'m a traveller myself, you must know.\'\r\n\r\n\'You, going to cut?\' cried Harold.\r\n\r\n\'Ay,\' said Dick, laying hold of the pony\'s rein.  \'The police have been\r\ndown at Rolt\'s--stupid fellow left old gander\'s feet about--Mrs. Barker\r\nswore to \'em \'cause he\'d had so many kicks and bites on common--Jesse\'s\r\ntook up and peached--I\'ve been hiding about all night--precious cold it\r\nwas, and just waiting, you see, to wish you good-bye.\'\r\n\r\nHarold, very much shocked, could have dispensed with his farewells, nor\r\ndid he like the look of his eyes.\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, Dick; I\'m sorry--I didn\'t think--but I\'m after time--I wish\r\nyou\'d let go of Peggy.\'\r\n\r\n\'So that\'s all you have to say to an old comrade!\' said Dick; \'but, I\r\nsay, Har\'ld, I\'m not going so.  I must have some tin to take me to\r\nPortsmouth.  I want to know what you\'ve got in that there bag!\'\r\n\r\n\'You won\'t have that; it\'s the post.  Let go, Dick;\' and he pushed the\r\npony forward, but Dick had got her fast by the head.  Harold looked round\r\nfor help, but Ragglesford Lane was one of the loneliest places in the\r\ncountry.  There was not a house for half a mile, and Lady Jane\'s\r\nplantations shut in the road on either side.\r\n\r\n\'I mean to have it,\' said Dick, looking coolly up into his face; \'I mean\r\nto see if there\'s any of the letters with a half-sovereign in \'em, that\r\nyou tell us about.\'\r\n\r\n\'Dick, Dick, it would be robbing!  For shame, Dick!  What would become of\r\nMother and me?\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s your look-out,\' said Dick; and he stretched out his hand for the\r\nbag.  He was four years older than Harold, and much stouter.\r\n\r\nHarold, with a ready move, chucked the bag round to his back, and shouted\r\nlustily in hopes that there might be a keeper in the woods, \'Help!\r\nThieves!  He\'s robbing the post!\'\r\n\r\nDick\'s hoarse laugh was all the answer.  \'That\'ll do, my dear,\' he said;\r\n\'now you\'d best be quiet; I\'d be loath to hurt you.\'\r\n\r\nFor all answer, Harold, shouting all the time, dealt him a stroke right\r\nover the eyes and nose with his riding-switch, and made a great effort to\r\nforce the pony on in hopes the blow might have made him slacken his hold.\r\nBut though one moment Dick\'s arm was thrown over his watering eyes, the\r\nother hand held the bridle as firmly as ever, and the next instant his\r\nfist dealt Harold such a blow, as nearly knocked out all his breath.\r\nSetting his teeth, and swearing an oath, Dick was pouncing on the boy\'s\r\narm, when from the road before them came bursting a meagre thing darting\r\nlike a wild cat, which fell upon him, hallooing as loud as Harold.\r\n\r\nDick turned in fury, and let go the bridle.  The pony backed in alarm.\r\nThe new-comer was grappling with the thief, and trying to drag him aside.\r\n\'On, on; go on, Har\'ld!\' he shouted, but his strength was far from equal\r\nto Dick\'s, who threw him aside on the hand-rail.  Old rotten rail that it\r\nwas, it crashed under the weight, and fell with both the boys into the\r\nwater.  Peggy dashed forward to the other side, where Harold pulled her\r\nup with much difficulty, and turned round to look at the robber and the\r\nchampion.  The fall was not far, nor the water deep, and they had both\r\nrisen, and were ready to seize one another again in their rage.  And now\r\nHarold saw that he who had come to his help was no other than Paul\r\nBlackthorn, who shouted loudly, \'On, go on!  I\'ll keep him.\'\r\n\r\n\'He\'ll kill you!\' screamed Harold, in despair, ready to push in between\r\nthem with his horse; but at that moment cart-wheels were heard in the\r\nroad, and Dick, shaking his fist, and swearing at them both, shook off\r\nPaul as if he had been a feather, and splashing out of the ford on the\r\nother side, leapt over the hedge, and was off through the plantations.\r\n\r\nPaul more slowly crept up towards Harold, dripping from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\'Paul!  Paul!  I\'m glad I\'ve found you!\' cried Harold.  \'You\'ve saved the\r\nletters, man, and one was registered!  Come along with me, up to the\r\nschool.\'\r\n\r\n\'Nay, I\'ll not do that,\' said Paul.\r\n\r\n\'Then you\'ll stay till I come back,\' said Harold earnestly; \'I\'ve got so\r\nmuch to tell you!  My Lady sent for you.  Our Ellen told her all about\r\nyou, and you\'re to go to her.  Ellen was in such a way when she found you\r\nwere off.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then she didn\'t think I\'d taken the eggs?\' said Paul.\r\n\r\n\'She\'d as soon think that I had,\' said Harold.  \'Why, don\'t we all know\r\nthat you\'re one of the parson\'s own sort?  But what made you go off\r\nwithout a word to nobody?\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know.  Every one was against me,\' said Paul; \'and I thought I\'d\r\njust go out of the way, and you\'d forget all about me.  But I never\r\ntouched those eggs, and you may tell Mr. Cope so, and thank him for all\r\nhis kindness to me.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'ll tell him yourself.  You\'re going home along with me,\' cried\r\nHarold.  \'There!  I\'ll not stir a step till you\'ve promised!  Why, if you\r\nmake off now, \'twill be the way to make them think you have something to\r\nrun away for, like that rascal.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very well,\' said Paul, rather dreamily.\r\n\r\n\'Then you won\'t?\' said Harold.  \'Upon your word and honour?\'\r\n\r\nPaul said the words after him, not much as if he knew what he was about;\r\nand Harold, rather alarmed at the sound of the Grange clock striking,\r\ngave a cut to the pony, and bounded on, only looking back to see that\r\nPaul was seating himself by the side of the lane.  Harold said to himself\r\nthat his mother would not have liked to see him do so after such a\r\nducking, but he knew that he was more tenderly treated than other lads,\r\nand with reason for precaution too; and he promised himself soon to be\r\nbringing Paul home to be dried and warmed.\r\n\r\nBut he was less speedy than he intended.  When he arrived at the school,\r\nhe had first to account to the servants for his being so late, and then\r\nhe was obliged to wait while the owner of the registered letter was to\r\nsign the green paper, acknowledging its safe delivery.\r\n\r\nInstead of having the receipt brought back to him, there came a message\r\nthat he was to go up to tell the master and the young gentlemen all about\r\nthe robbery.\r\n\r\nSo the servant led the way, and Harold followed a little shy, but more\r\ncurious.  The boys were in school, a great bare white-washed room,\r\nlooking very cold, with a large arched window at one end, and forms\r\nranged in squares round the hacked and hewed deal tables.  Harold thought\r\nhe should tell Alfred that the young gentlemen had not much the advantage\r\nof themselves in their schoolroom.\r\n\r\nThe boys were mostly smaller than he was, only those of the uppermost\r\nform being of the same size.  There might be about forty of them, looking\r\nrather red and purple with the chilly morning, and all their eighty eyes,\r\nblack or brown, blue or grey, fixed at once upon the young postman as he\r\nwalked into the room, straight and upright, in his high stout gaiters\r\nover his cord trousers, his thick rough blue coat and red comforter, with\r\nhis cap in his hand, his fair hair uncovered, and his blue eyes and rosy\r\ncheeks all the more bright for that strange morning\'s work.  He was a\r\nwell-mannered boy, and made his bow very properly to Mr. Carter, the\r\nmaster, who sat at his high desk.\r\n\r\n\'So, my little man,\' said the master, \'I hear you\'ve had a fight for our\r\nproperty this morning.  You\'ve saved this young gentleman\'s birthday\r\npresent of a watch, and he wants to thank you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, Sir,\' said Harold; \'but he\'d have been too much for me if\r\nPaul hadn\'t come to help.  He\'s a deal bigger than me.\'\r\n\r\nThe boys all made a thumping and scuffling with their feet, as if to\r\napplaud Harold; and their master said, \'Tell us how it was.\'\r\n\r\nHarold gave the account in a very good simple manner, only he did not say\r\nwho the robber was--he did not like to do so--indeed, he would not quite\r\nbelieve it could be his old friend Dick.  The boys clapped and thumped\r\ndoubly when he came to the switching, and still more at the tumble into\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n\'Do you know who the fellow was?\' asked Mr. Carter.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I knowed him,\' said Harold, and stopped there.\r\n\r\n\'But you had rather not tell.  Is that it?\'\r\n\r\n\'Please, Sir, he\'s gone, and I wouldn\'t get him into trouble.\'\r\n\r\nAt this the school-boys perfectly stamped, and made signs of cheering.\r\n\r\n\'And who is the boy that came to help you?\'\r\n\r\n\'Paul Blackthorn, Sir; he\'s a boy from the Union who worked at Farmer\r\nShepherd\'s.  He\'s a right good boy, Sir; but he\'s got no friends, nor\r\nno--nothing,\' said Harold, pausing ere he finished.\r\n\r\n\'Why didn\'t you bring him up with you?\' asked the master.\r\n\r\n\'Please, Sir, he wouldn\'t come.\'\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Mr. Carter, \'you\'ve behaved like a brave fellow, and so has\r\nyour friend; and here\'s something in token of gratitude for the rescue of\r\nour property.\'\r\n\r\nIt was a crown piece.\r\n\r\n\'And here,\' said the boy whose watch had been saved, \'here\'s\r\nhalf-a-crown.  Shake hands, you\'re a jolly fellow; and I\'ll tell my uncle\r\nabout you.\'\r\n\r\nHarold was a true Englishman, and of course his only answer could be,\r\n\'Thank you, Sir, I only did my duty;\' and as the other boys, whose money\r\nhad been rescued, brought forward more silver pledges of gratitude, he\r\nadded, \'I\'ll take it to Paul--thank you, Sir--thank you, Sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s right; you must share, my lad,\' said the school-master.  \'It is a\r\nreward for both of you.\'\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, Sir, it was _my_ duty,\' repeated Harold, making his bow.\r\n\r\n\'Sir, Sir, pray let us give him three cheers,\' burst out the head boy in\r\nan imploring voice.\r\n\r\nMr. Carter smiled and nodded; and there was such a hearty roaring and\r\nstamping, such \'hip, hip, hurrah!\' bursting out again and again, that the\r\nwindows clattered, and the room seemed fuller of noise than it could\r\npossibly hold.  It is not quite certain that Mr. Carter did not halloo as\r\nloud as any of the boys.\r\n\r\nHarold turned very red, and did not know which way to look while it was\r\ngoing on, nor what to do when it was over, except to say a very odd sort\r\nof \'Thank you, Sir;\' but his heart leapt up with a kind of warm grateful\r\nfeeling of liking towards those boys for going along with him so\r\nheartily; and the cheers gave a pleasure and glow that the coins never\r\nwould have done, even had he thought them his own by right.\r\n\r\nHe was not particularly good in this; he had never felt the pinch of\r\nwant, and was too young to care; and he did not happen to wish to buy\r\nanything in particular just then.  A selfish or a covetous boy would not\r\nhave felt as he did; but these were not his temptations.  Knowing, as he\r\ndid, that the assault had been the consequence of his foolish boasts\r\nabout the money-letters, and that he, being in charge, ought to defend\r\nthem to the last gasp, he was sure he deserved the very contrary from a\r\nreward, and never thought of the money belonging to any one but Paul, who\r\nhad by his own free will come to the rescue, and saved the bag from\r\nrobbery, himself from injury and disgrace.\r\n\r\nHow happy he was in thinking what a windfall it was for his friend, and\r\nhow far it would go in fitting him up respectably!\r\n\r\nPeggy was ready to trot nearly as fast as he wished her down the lane to\r\nthe place where he had left Paul; and no sooner did Harold come in sight\r\nof the olive-coloured rags, than he bawled out a loud \'Hurrah!  Come on,\r\nPaul; you don\'t know what I\'ve got for you!  \'Twas a young gentleman\'s\r\nwatch as you saved; and they\'ve come down right handsome! and here\'s\r\ntwelve-and-sixpence for you--enough to rig you out like a regular swell!\r\nWhy, what\'s the matter?\' he added in quite another voice, as he had now\r\ncome up to Paul, and found him sitting nearly doubled up, with his head\r\nbent over his knees.\r\n\r\nHe raised his face up as Harold came, and it was so ghastly pale, that\r\nthe boy, quite startled, jumped off his pony.\r\n\r\n\'Why, old chap, what is it?  Have you got knit up with cold, sitting\r\nhere?\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I suppose so,\' said Paul; but his very voice shivered, his teeth\r\nchattered, and his knees knocked together with the chill.  \'The pains run\r\nabout me,\' he added; but he spoke as if he hardly knew what he was doing\r\nor saying.\r\n\r\n\'You must come home with me, and Mother will give you something hot,\'\r\nsaid Harold.  \'Come, you\'ll catch your death if you don\'t.  You shall\r\nride home.\'\r\n\r\nHe pulled Paul from his seat with some difficulty, and was further\r\nalarmed when he found that the poor fellow reeled and could hardly stand;\r\nbut he was somewhat roused, and knew better what he was about.  Harold\r\ntried to put him on the pony, but this could not be managed: he could not\r\nhelp himself enough, Peggy always swerved aside, nor was Harold strong\r\nenough to lift him up.\r\n\r\nThe only thing to be done was for Harold to mount, and Paul to lean\r\nagainst the saddle, while the pony walked.  When they had to separate at\r\nthe ford, poor Paul\'s walk across the bridge was so feeble and\r\nstaggering, that Harold feared every moment that he would fall where the\r\nrail was broken away, but was right glad to put his arm on his shoulder\r\nagain to help to hold him up.  The moving brought a little more life back\r\nto the poor boy\'s limbs, and he walked a little better, and managed to\r\ntell Harold how he had felt too miserable to speak to any one after the\r\nrating the farmer had given him, and how he had set out on the tramp for\r\nmore work, though with hope so nearly dead in his heart, that he only\r\nwished he could sit down and die.  He had walked out of the village\r\nbefore people were about, so as not to be noticed, and then had found\r\nhimself so weak and weary that he could not get on without food, and had\r\nsat down by the hedge to eat the bit of bread he had with him.  Then he\r\nhad taken the first lonely-looking way he saw, without knowing that it\r\nwas one of Harold\'s daily rides, and was slowly dragging himself up the\r\nhill from the ford when the well-known voice, shouting for help, had\r\nsuddenly called him back, and filled him with spirit and speed that were\r\nfar enough off now, poor fellow!\r\n\r\nThat was a terrible mile and a half--Harold sometimes thought it would\r\nnever be over, or that Paul would drop down, and he would have to gallop\r\noff for help; but Paul was not one to give in, and somehow they got back\r\nat last, and Harold, with his arm round his friend, dragged him through\r\nthe garden, and across the shop, and pushed him into the arm-chair by the\r\nfire, Mrs. King following, and Ellen rushing down from up-stairs.\r\n\r\n\'There!\' cried Harold, all in a breath, \'there he is!  That rascal tried\r\nto rob me on Ragglesford Bridge, and was nigh too much for me; but _he_\r\nthere came and pulled him off me, and got spilt into the river, and he\'s\r\ngot a chill, and if you don\'t give him something jolly hot, Mother, he\'ll\r\ncatch his death!\'\r\n\r\nMrs. King thought so too: Paul\'s state looked to her more alarming than\r\nit did even to Harold.  He did not seem able to think or speak, but kept\r\nrocking himself towards the fire, and that terrible shivering shaking him\r\nall over.\r\n\r\n\'Poor lad!\' she said kindly.  \'I\'ll tell you what, Harold, all you can do\r\nis put him into your bed at once.--Here, Ellen, you run up first, and\r\nbring me a shirt to warm for him.  Then we\'ll get his own clothes dried.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, no,\' cried Harold, with a caper, \'we\'ll make a scare-crow of \'em.\r\nYou don\'t know what I know, Mother.  I\'ve got twelve shillings and\r\nsixpence here all his own; and you\'ll see what I won\'t do with it at old\r\nLevi\'s, the second-hand clothes man, to-night.\'\r\n\r\nHarold grew less noisy as he saw how little good the fire was doing to\r\nhis patient, and how ill his mother seemed to think him.  He quietly\r\nobeyed her, by getting him up-stairs, and putting him into his own bed,\r\nthe first in which Paul had lain down for more than four months.  Then\r\nMrs. King sent Harold out for some gin; she thought hot spirits and water\r\nthe only chance of bringing back any life after such a dreadful chill;\r\nand she and Ellen kept on warming flannels and shawls to restore some\r\nheat, and to stop the trembling that shook the bed, so that Alfred felt\r\nit, even in the next room, where he lay with the door open, longing to be\r\nable to help, and wishing to understand what could have happened.\r\n\r\nAt last, the cordial and the warm applications effected some good.  Paul\r\nwas able to say, \'I don\'t know why you are so good to me,\' and seemed\r\nready to burst into a great fit of crying; but Mrs. King managed to stop\r\nhim by saying something about one good turn deserving another, and that\r\nshe hoped he was coming round now.\r\n\r\nHarold was now at leisure to tell the story in his brother\'s room.  Alfred\r\ndid not grieve now at his brother\'s being able to do spirited things; he\r\nlaughed out loud, and said, \'Well done, Harold!\' at the switching, and\r\nrubbed his hands, and lighted up with glee, as he heard of the\r\nRagglesford boys and their cheers; and then, Harold went eagerly on with\r\nhis scheme for fitting up Paul at the second-hand shop, both Mrs. King\r\nand Alfred taking great interest in his plans, till Mrs. King hearing\r\nsomething like a moan, went back to Paul.\r\n\r\nShe found his cheeks and hands as burning hot as they had been cold; they\r\nwere like live coals; and what was worse, such severe pains were running\r\nall over his limbs, that he was squeezing the clothes into his mouth that\r\nhe might not scream aloud.\r\n\r\nHappily it was Mr. Blunt\'s day for calling; and before the morning was\r\nover he came, and after a few words of explanation, he stood at Paul\'s\r\nbedside.\r\n\r\nNot much given to tenderness towards the feelings of patients of his\r\ndegree, Mr. Blunt\'s advice was soon given.  \'Yes, he is in for rheumatic\r\nfever--won\'t be about again for a long time to come.  I say, Mistress,\r\nall you\'ve got to do is to send in your boy to the Union at Elbury, tell\r\n\'em to send out a cart for him, and take him in as a casual pauper.  Then\r\nthey may pass him on to his parish.\'\r\n\r\nTherewith Mr. Blunt went on to attend to Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'Then you think this poor lad will be ill a long time, Sir?\' said Mrs.\r\nKing, when Mr. Blunt was preparing to depart.\r\n\r\n\'Of course he will; I never saw a clearer case!  You\'d better send him\r\noff as fast as you can, while he can be moved.  He\'ll have a pretty bout\r\nof it, I dare say.\r\n\r\n\'It is nothing infectious, of course, Sir?\' said the mother, a little\r\nstartled by this hastiness.\r\n\r\n\'Infectious--nonsense! why, you know better than that, Mrs. King; I only\r\nmeant that you\'d better get rid of him as quick as you can, unless you\r\nwish to set up a hospital at once--and a capital nurse you\'d be!  I would\r\nleave word with the relieving officer for you, but that I\'ve got to go on\r\nto Stoke, and shan\'t be at home till too late.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. King\'s heart ached for the poor forlorn orphan, when she remembered\r\nwhat she had heard of the nursing in Elbury Union.  She did not know how\r\nto turn him from her door the day he had saved her son from danger such\r\nas she could not think of without shuddering; and yet, what could she do?\r\nHer rent and the winter before her, a heavy doctor\'s bill, and the loss\r\nof Alfred\'s work!\r\n\r\nSlowly she went up the stairs again to the narrow landing that held the\r\nbed where Paul Blackthorn lay.  He was quite still, but there were large\r\ntears coursing one after the other from his eyes, his hollow cheeks quite\r\nglazed with them.\r\n\r\n\'Is the pain so very bad?\' she said in her soft voice, putting her hand\r\nover his hot forehead, in the way that Alfred liked.\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t--know,\' he answered; and his black eyes, after looking up once\r\nin her face with the piteous earnest glance that some loving dogs have,\r\nshut themselves as if on purpose to keep in the tears, but she saw the\r\ndew squeezing out through the eye-lashes.\r\n\r\n\'My poor boy, I\'m sure it\'s very bad for you,\' she said again.\r\n\r\n\'Please, don\'t speak so kind,\' said Paul; and this time he could not\r\nprevent a-sob.  \'Nobody ever did so before, and--\' he paused, and went\r\non, \'I suppose they do it up in Heaven, so I hope I shall die.\'\r\n\r\n\'You are vexing about the Union,\' said Mrs. King, without answering this\r\nlast speech, or she knew that she should begin to cry herself.\r\n\r\n\'I _did_ think I\'d done with them,\' said Paul, with another sob.  \'I said\r\nI\'d never set foot in those four walls again!  I was proud, maybe; but\r\nplease don\'t stop with me!  If you wouldn\'t look and speak like that, the\r\nplace wouldn\'t seem so hard, seeing I\'m bred to it, as they say;\' and he\r\nmade an odd sort of attempt to laugh, which ended in his choking himself\r\nwith worse tears.\r\n\r\n\'Harold is not gone yet,\' said Mrs. King soothingly; \'we\'ll wait till he\r\ncomes in from his work, and see how you are, when you\'ve had a little\r\nsleep.  Don\'t cry; you aren\'t going just yet.\'\r\n\r\nThat same earnest questioning glance, but with more hope in it, was\r\nturned on her again; but she did not dare to bind herself, much as she\r\nlonged to take the wanderer to her home.  She went on to her son\'s room.\r\n\r\n\'Mother, Mother,\' Alfred cried in a whisper, so eager that it made him\r\ncough, \'you can\'t never send him to the workhouse?\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t bear the thought, Alfy,\' she said, the tears in her eyes; \'but I\r\ndon\'t know what to do.  It\'s not the trouble.  That I\'d take with all my\r\nheart, but it is hard enough to live, and--\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure,\' said Ellen, coming close, that her undertone might be heard,\r\n\'Harold and I would never mind how much we were pinched.\'\r\n\r\n\'And I could go without--some things,\' began Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'And then,\' went on the mother, \'you see, if we got straitened, and\r\nMatilda found it out, she\'d want to help, and I can\'t have her savings\r\ntouched; and yet I can\'t bear to let that poor lad be sent off, so ill as\r\nhe is, and after all he\'s done for Harold--such a good boy, too, and one\r\nthat\'s so thankful for a common kind word.\'\r\n\r\n\'O Mother, keep him!\' said Alfred; \'don\'t you know how the Psalm says,\r\n"God careth for the stranger, and provideth for the fatherless and the\r\nwidow"?\'\r\n\r\nMrs. King almost smiled.  \'Yes, Alf, I think it would be trusting God\'s\r\nword; but then there\'s my duty to you.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'ve not sent Harold off for the cart?\' said Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'No; I thought somehow, we have enough for to-day; and it goes against me\r\nto send him away at once.  I thought we\'d wait to see how it is\r\nto-morrow; and Harold won\'t mind having a bed made up in the kitchen.\'\r\n\r\nTap, tap, on the counter.  Some one had come in while they were talking.\r\nIt was Mr. Cope, very anxious to hear the truth of the strange stories\r\nthat were going about the place.  Ellen and Alfred thought it very\r\ntiresome that he was so long in coming up-stairs; but the fact was, that\r\ntheir mother was very glad to talk the matter over without them.  She\r\nknew indeed that Mr. Cope was a very young man, and not likely to be so\r\nwell able as herself, with all her experience, to decide what she could\r\nafford, or whether she ought to follow her feelings at the risk of debt\r\nor of privations for her delicate children; but she also knew that though\r\nhe had not experience, education had given him a wider and clearer range\r\nof thought; and that, as her pastor, he ought to be consulted; so though\r\nshe did not exactly mean to make it a matter for his decision (unless,\r\nindeed, he should have some view which had not occurred to her), she knew\r\nthat he was by far the best person to help her to see her way, and form\r\nher own judgment.\r\n\r\nMr. Cope heard all the story with as much eagerness as the Ragglesford\r\nboys themselves, and laughed quite out loud at Harold\'s spirited defence.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s a good lad!\' said he.  \'Well, Mrs. King, I don\'t think you need\r\nbe very uneasy about your boy.  When a fellow can stand up like that in\r\ndefence of his duty, there must be the right stuff in him to be got at in\r\ntime!  And now, as to his ally--this other poor fellow--very kind of you\r\nto have taken him in.\'\r\n\r\n\'I couldn\'t do no other, Sir,\' said Mrs. King; \'he came in so drenched,\r\nand so terribly bad, I could do nothing but let him lie down on Harold\'s\r\nbed; and now Dr. Blunt thinks he\'s going to have a rheumatic fever, and\r\nwanted me to send in to the relieving officer, to have him removed, but I\r\ndon\'t know how to do that; the poor lad doesn\'t say one word against it,\r\nbut I can see it cuts him to the heart; and they do tell such stories of\r\nthe nurses at the Union, that it does seem hard to send him there, such\r\nan innocent boy, too, and one that doesn\'t seem to know how to believe it\r\nif one says a kind word to him.\' The tears were in Mrs. King\'s eyes as\r\nshe went on: \'I do wish to let him stay here and do what I can for him,\r\nwith all my heart, and so does all the children, but I don\'t hardly know\r\nwhat\'s right by them, poor things.  If the parish would but allow him\r\njust one shilling and sixpence a week out of the house, I think I could\r\ndo it.\'\r\n\r\n\'What, with your own boy in such a state, you could undertake to nurse a\r\nstranger through a rheumatic fever!\'\r\n\r\n\'It wouldn\'t make much difference, Sir,\' said Mrs. King.  \'You see I am\r\nup a good deal most nights with Alfred, and we have fire and candle\r\nalmost always alight.  I should only be glad to do it for a poor\r\nmotherless lad like that, except for the cost; and I thought perhaps if\r\nyou could speak to the Guardians, they might allow him ever so little,\r\nbecause there will be expenses.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Cope had not much hope from the parish, so he said, \'Mr. Shepherd\r\nought to do something for him after he has worked for him so long.  He\r\nhas been looking wretchedly ill for some time past; and I dare say half\r\nthis illness is brought on by such lodging and living as he got there.\r\nBut what did you say about some eggs?\'\r\n\r\nMrs. King told him; and he stood a moment thoughtful, then said, \'Well,\r\nI\'ll go and see about it,\' and strode across to the farm.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Cope came back, Ellen was serving a customer.  He stood looking\r\nredder than they had ever seen him, and tapping the toe of his boot\r\nimpatiently with his stick; and the moment the buyer had turned away, he\r\nsaid, \'Ellen, ask your mother to be kind enough to come down.\'\r\n\r\nMrs. King came, and found the young Curate in such a state of\r\nindignation, as he could not keep to himself.  He had learnt more than he\r\nhad ever known, or she had ever known, of the oppression that the farmer\r\nand his wife and Tom Boldre had practised on the friendless stranger, and\r\nhe was burning with all the keen generous displeasure of one new to such\r\nbase ways.  At the gate he had met, going home to dinner, John Farden\r\nwith Mrs. Hayward, who had been charing at the farm.  Both had spoken\r\nout, and he had learned how far below the value of his labour the boy had\r\nbeen paid, how he had been struck, abused, and hunted about, as would\r\nnever have been done to one who had a father to take his part.  And he\r\nhad further heard Farden\'s statement of having himself thrown away the\r\neggs, and Mrs. Hayward\'s declaration that she verily believed that the\r\nfarmer only made the accusation an excuse for hurrying the lad off\r\nbecause he thought him faltering for a fever, and wouldn\'t have him sick\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThis was shocking enough; Mr. Cope had thought it merely the kind-hearted\r\nwoman\'s angry construction, but it was still worse when he came to the\r\nfarmer and his wife.\r\n\r\nSo used were they to think it their business to wring the utmost they\r\ncould out of whatever came in their way, that they had not the slightest\r\nshame about it.  They thought they had done a thing to be proud of in\r\nmaking such a good bargain of the lad, and getting so much work out of\r\nhim for so little pay; in fact, that they had been rather weakly kind in\r\ngranting him the freedom of the hay-loft; the notion of his dishonesty\r\nwas firmly fixed in their heads, though there was not a charge to bring\r\nagainst him.  This was chiefly because they had begun by setting him down\r\nas a convict, and because they could not imagine any one living honestly\r\non what they gave him.  And lastly, the farmer thought the cleverest\r\nstroke of all, was the having got rid of him just as winter was coming on\r\nand work was scarce, and when there seemed to be a chance of his being\r\nlaid up to encumber the rates.  Mr. Cope was quite breathless after the\r\nanswer he had made to them.  He had never spoken so strongly in his life\r\nbefore, and he could hardly believe his own ears, that people could be\r\nfound, not only to do such things, but to be proud of having done them.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped there are not many such thoroughgoing tyrants; but\r\nselfishness is always ready to make any one into a tyrant, and Mammon is\r\na false god, who manages to make his servants satisfied that they are\r\ndoing their duty.\r\n\r\nIt was plain enough that no help was to be expected from the farm, and\r\nneither Mrs. King nor the clergyman thought there was much hope in the\r\nGuardians; however, they were to be applied to, and this would be at\r\nleast a reprieve for Paul.  Mr. Cope went up to see him, and found Harold\r\nsitting on the top step of the stairs.\r\n\r\n\'Well, boys,\' he said, in his hearty voice, \'so you\'ve had a battle, I\r\nhear.  I\'m glad it turned out better than your namesake\'s at Hastings.\'\r\n\r\nPaul was not too ill to smile at this; and Harold modestly said, \'It was\r\nall along of he, Sir.\'\r\n\r\n\'And he seems to be the chief sufferer.--Are you in much pain, Paul?\'\r\n\r\n\'Sometimes, Sir, when I try to move,\' said Paul; \'but it is better when\r\nI\'m still.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'ve had a harder time of it than I supposed, my boy,\' said Mr. Cope.\r\n\'Why did you never let me know how you were treated?\'\r\n\r\nPaul\'s face shewed more wonder than anything else.  \'Thank you, Sir,\' he\r\nsaid, \'I didn\'t think it was any one\'s business.\'\r\n\r\n\'No one\'s business!\' exclaimed the young clergyman.  \'It is every one\'s\r\nbusiness to see justice done, and it should never have gone on so if you\r\nhad spoken.  Why didn\'t you?\'\r\n\r\n\'I didn\'t think it would be any use,\' again said Paul.  \'There was old\r\nJoe Joiner, he always said \'twas a hard world to live in, and that there\r\nwas nothing for it but to grin and bear it.\'\r\n\r\n\'There\'s something better to be done than to grin,\' said Mr. Cope.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, I know, Sir,\' said Paul, with a brighter gleam on his face; \'and I\r\nseem to understand that better since I came here.  I was thinking,\' he\r\nadded, \'if they pass me back to Upperscote, I\'ll tell old Joe that folks\r\nare much kinder than he told me, by far.\'\r\n\r\n\'Kinder--I should not have thought that your experience!\' exclaimed Mr.\r\nCope, his head still running on the Shepherds.\r\n\r\nBut Paul did not seem to think of them at all, or else to take their\r\ntreatment as a matter-of-course, as he did his Union hardships.  There\r\nwas a glistening in his eyes; and he moved his head so as to sign down-\r\nstairs, as he said, \'I didn\'t think there was ne\'er a one in the world\r\nlike _her_.\'\r\n\r\n\'What, Mrs. King?  I don\'t think there are many,\' said Mr. Cope warmly.\r\n\'And yet I hope there are.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ay, Sir,\' said Paul fervently.  \'And there\'s Harold, and John Farden,\r\nand all the chaps.  Please, Sir, when I\'m gone away, will you tell them\r\nall that I\'ll never forget \'em? and I\'ll be happier as long as I live for\r\nknowing that there are such good-hearted folks.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Cope felt trebly moved towards one who thought harshness so much more\r\nnatural than kindness, and who received the one so submissively, the\r\nother so gratefully; but the conversation was interrupted by Harold\'s\r\nexclaiming that my Lady in her carriage was stopping at the gate, and\r\nMother was running out to her.\r\n\r\nRumours of the post-office robbery, as little Miss Selby called it, had\r\ntravelled up to the Grange, and she was wild to know what had happened to\r\nHarold; but her grandmamma, not knowing what highway robbers might be\r\nroaming about Friarswood, would not hear of her walking to the\r\npost-office, and drove thither with her herself, in full state, close\r\ncarriage, coachman and footman; and there was Mrs. King, with her head in\r\nat the carriage window, telling all the story.\r\n\r\n\'So you have this youth here?\' said Lady Jane.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, my Lady; he was so poorly that I couldn\'t but let him lie down.\'\r\n\r\n\'And you have not sent him to the workhouse yet?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, no, not yet, my Lady; I thought I would wait to see how he is to-\r\nmorrow.\'\r\n\r\n\'You had better take care, Mary,\' said Lady Jane.  \'You\'ll have him too\r\nill to be moved; and then what will you do? a great lad of that age, and\r\nwith illness enough in the house already!\'  She sighed, and it was not\r\nsaid unkindly; but Mrs. King answered with something about his being so\r\ngood a lad, and so friendless.  And Miss Jane exclaimed, \'O Grandmamma,\r\nit does seem so hard to send him to the workhouse!\'\r\n\r\n\'Do not talk like a silly child, my dear,\' said Lady Jane.  \'Mary is much\r\ntoo sensible to think of saddling herself with such a charge--not fit for\r\nher, nor the children either--even if the parish made it worth her while,\r\nwhich it never will.  The Union is intended to provide for such cases of\r\ndestitution; and depend on it, the youth looks to nothing else.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, my Lady,\' said Mrs. King; \'he is so patient and meek about it, that\r\nit goes to one\'s very heart.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ay, ay,\' said the old lady; \'but don\'t be soft-hearted and weak, Mary.\r\nIt is not what I expect of you, as a sensible woman, to be harbouring a\r\nmere vagrant whom you know nothing about, and injuring your own\r\nchildren.\'\r\n\r\n\'Indeed, my Lady,\' began Mrs. King, \'I\'ve known the poor boy these four\r\nmonths, and so has Mr. Cope; and he is as steady and serious a boy as\r\never lived.\'\r\n\r\n\'Very likely,\' said Lady Jane; \'and I am sure I would do anything for\r\nhim--give him work when he is out again, or send him with a paper to the\r\ncounty hospital.  Eh?\'\r\n\r\nBut the county hospital was thirty miles off; and the receiving day was\r\nnot till Saturday.  That would not do.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' added Lady Jane, \'I\'ll drive home directly, and send Price with\r\nthe spring covered cart to take him in to Elbury.  That will be better\r\nfor him than jolting in the open cart they would send for him.\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, thank you, my Lady, but I--I had passed my word that he should not\r\ngo to-day.\'\r\n\r\nLady Jane made a gesture as if Mary King were a hopelessly weak\r\ngood-natured woman; and shaking her head at her with a sort of lady-like\r\nvexation, ordered the coachman to drive on.\r\n\r\nMy Lady was put out.  No wonder.  She was a very sensible, managing woman\r\nherself, and justly and up-rightly kind to all her dependants; and she\r\nexpected every one else to be sternly and wisely kind in the same\r\npattern.  Mrs. King was one whom she highly esteemed for her sense and\r\ngood judgment, and she was the more provoked with her for any failure in\r\nthese respects.  If she had known Paul as the Kings did, it is probable\r\nshe might have felt like them.  Not knowing him, nor knowing the secrets\r\nof Elbury Union, she thought it Mrs. King\'s clear duty to sacrifice him\r\nfor her children\'s sake.  Moreover, Lady Jane had strict laws against\r\nlodgers--the greatest kindness she could do her tenants, though often\r\nagainst their will.  So to have her model woman receiving a strange boy\r\ninto her house, even under the circumstances, was beyond bearing.\r\n\r\nSo Mrs. King stood on her threshold, knowing that to keep Paul Blackthorn\r\nwould be an offence to her best friend and patroness.  Moreover, Mr. Cope\r\nwas gone, without having left her a word of advice to decide her one way\r\nor the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X--CHRISTMAS DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThings are rather apt to settle themselves; and so did Paul Blackthorn\'s\r\nstay at the post-office, for the poor boy was in such an agony of pain\r\nall night, and the fever ran so high, that it was impossible to think of\r\nmoving him, even if the waiting upon him in such suffering had not made\r\nMrs. King feel that she could not dismiss him to careless hands.  His\r\npatience, gratitude, and surprise at every trouble she took for him were\r\nvery endearing, as were the efforts he made to stifle and suppress moans\r\nand cries that the terrible aches would wring from him, so as not to\r\ndisturb Alfred.  When towards morning the fever ran to his head, and he\r\ndid not know what he said, it was more moving still to see that the\r\ninstinct of keeping quiet for some one\'s sake still suppressed his voice.\r\nThen, too, his wanderings shewed under what dread and harshness his life\r\nhad been spent, and what his horror was of a return to the workhouse.  In\r\nhis senses, he would never have thought of asking to remain at\r\nFriarswood; but in his half-conscious state, he implored again and again\r\nnot to be sent away, and talked about not going back, but only being left\r\nin a corner to die; and Mrs. King, without knowing what she was about,\r\nsoothed him by telling him to lie still, for he was not going to that\r\nplace again.  At day-break she sent Harold, on his way to the post, for\r\nan order from the relieving officer for medical attendance; and, after\r\nsome long and weary hours, the Union doctor came.  He said, like Mr.\r\nBlunt, that it was a rheumatic fever, the effect of hardship and\r\nexposure; for which perhaps poor Paul--after his regular meals, warm\r\nclothing, and full shelter, in the workhouse--was less prepared than many\r\na country lad, whose days had been much happier, but who had been\r\nrendered more hardy by often going without some of those necessaries\r\nwhich were provided for the paupers.\r\n\r\nThe head continued so much affected, that the doctor said the hair must\r\nbe taken off; which was done by old Master Warren, who singed the horses\r\nin the autumn, killed the pigs in the winter, and shaved the men on\r\nSaturday night.  It was a very good thing for all parties; and he would\r\ntake no pay for his trouble, but sent down a pitcher with what he called\r\n\'all manner of yarbs\' steeping in it, with which, as he said, to \'ferment\r\nthe boy\'s limbs.\'  Foment was what he meant; and Mrs. King thought, as it\r\nwas kindly intended, and could do no harm, she would try if it would do\r\nany good; but she could not find that it made much difference whether she\r\nused that or common warm water.  However, the good will made Paul smile,\r\nand helped to change his notion about its being very few that had any\r\ncompassion for a stranger.  So, too, did good Mrs. Hayward, who, when he\r\nwas at the worst, twice came to sit up all night with him after her day\'s\r\nwork; and though she was not as tender a nurse as Mrs. King, treated him\r\nlike her own son, and moreover carried off to her own tub all the clothes\r\nshe could find ready to be washed, and would not take so much as a\r\nmouthful of meat or drink in return, struggling, toil-worn body as she\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nThe parish, as might have been foreseen, would afford nothing but the\r\ndoctor to a chance-comer such as Paul.  If he needed more, he might come\r\ninto the House, and be passed home to Upperscote.\r\n\r\nBut by the time this reply came, Mrs. King not only felt that it would be\r\nalmost murder to send a person in such a state four miles on a November\r\nday, but she was caring so much for her patient, that it sounded almost\r\nas impossible as to send Alfred away.\r\n\r\nBesides, she had remembered the cup of cold water, she had thought of the\r\nwidow\'s cruse of oil and barrel of meal, and she had called to mind,\r\n\'Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren,\r\nye have done it unto Me;\' and thereupon she took heart, and made up her\r\nmind that it was right to tend the sick lad; and that even if she should\r\nbring trouble and want on herself and her children, it would be a Heaven-\r\nsent trial that would be good for them.\r\n\r\nSo she made up her resolution to a winter of toil, anxiety, and trouble,\r\nand to Lady Jane\'s withdrawal of favour; and thinking her ungrateful,\r\nwhich, to say the truth, grieved her more than anything else, excepting\r\nof course her forebodings for Alfred.\r\n\r\nEllen was in great distress about my Lady\'s displeasure.  Not that she\r\ndreamt of her mother\'s giving up Paul on that account; but she was very\r\nfond of her little foster-sister, and of many of the maid-servants, and\r\nher visits to the Grange were the chief change and amusement she ever\r\nhad.  So while Mrs. King was busy between the shop, her work, and Paul,\r\nEllen sat by her brother, making the housekeeper\'s winter dress, and\r\nimagining all sorts of dreadful things that might come of my Lady being\r\nangry with them, till Alfred grew quite out of patience.  \'Well, suppose\r\nand suppose,\' he said, \'suppose it was not to happen at all!  Why,\r\nMother\'s doing right would be any good for nothing if she only did it to\r\nplease my Lady.\'\r\n\r\nCertainly this was the very touchstone to shew whether the fear of man\r\nwere the guide.  And Ellen was still more terrified that day, for when\r\nshe went across to the farm for the evening\'s supply of milk and butter,\r\nMrs. Shepherd launched out into such a torrent of abuse against her and\r\nher mother, that she came home trembling from head to foot; and Mrs. King\r\ndeclared she should never go thither again.  They would send to Mrs.\r\nPrice\'s for the little bit of fresh butter that was real nourishment to\r\nAlfred: the healthy ones would save by going without any.\r\n\r\nOne word more as to the Shepherds, and then we have done with him.  On\r\nthe Sunday, Mr. Cope had an elder brother staying with them, who preached\r\non the lesson for the day, the second chapter of the Prophet Habakkuk;\r\nand when he came to the text, \'Woe to him that coveteth an evil\r\ncovetousness to his house,\' he brought in some of the like passages, the\r\nthreats to those that \'grind the faces of the poor,\' that \'oppress the\r\nhireling in his wages,\' and that terrible saying of St. James, \'Behold,\r\nthe hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of\r\nyou kept by fraud, crieth; and the cries of them which have reaped are\r\nentered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbath.\'\r\n\r\nThree days after, the Curate was very much amazed to hear that Mr. and\r\nMrs. Shepherd did not choose to be preached at in their own church, and\r\nnever meant to come thither again.  Now it so happened that he could\r\ntestify that the sermon had been written five years ago, and that his\r\nbrother had preached it without knowing that the Shepherds were in\r\nexistence, for he had only come late the night before, and there was so\r\nmuch to say about their home, that the younger brother had not said a\r\nword about his parish before church, though the Kings and their guests\r\nwere very near his heart.\r\n\r\nBut it was of no use to say so.  It was the _truth_ that wounded the\r\nfarmer and his wife, and no one could make that otherwise.  They did not\r\nchoose to hear their sin rebuked, so they made an excuse by pretending to\r\ntake offence, and except when they now and then went to the next parish\r\nto a meeting-house, cut themselves off from all that might disturb them\r\nin the sole pursuit of gain.  It is awful to think of such hardening of\r\nthe heart, first towards man, then towards the warnings of God.\r\n\r\nAnd mind, whoever chooses profit rather than mercy, is in the path of\r\nFarmer Shepherd.\r\n\r\nSome certainty as to Lady Jane Selby\'s feelings came on the second\r\nevening of Paul\'s illness.  Mrs. Crabbe, the housekeeper, was seen with\r\ninfinite trouble and disgust getting her large person over the stiles\r\nacross the path fields.  A call from her was almost a greater event than\r\none from my Lady herself.  Why!  Mother had been her still-room maid, and\r\nalways spoke to her as \'Ma\'am,\' and she called her \'Mary,\' and she had\r\nchosen Matilda\'s name for her, and had given her a silver watch!\r\n\r\nSo when Mrs. Crabbe had found her way in, and had been set down to rest\r\nin the arm-chair, she proceeded to give \'Mary\' a good round scolding\r\nagainst being weak and soft-hearted, saying at last that my Lady was\r\nquite in a way about it.  She was sure that Harold would catch his death\r\nof cold, putting him to sleep in the kitchen, upon the stones--and so--my\r\nLady had sent off the cart with the little chair-bed, that would take\r\ndown and put up again--mattress, bed-clothes, and all.\r\n\r\nThat was a comfortable finish to the scolding!  Not that it was a finish\r\nthough, for the thanks made Mrs. Crabbe afraid the family thought\r\nthemselves forgiven, so she went on to declare they all would be pinched,\r\nand get into debt, and she should advise her god-daughter, Matilda, not\r\nto help them with a farthing of her wages, and as to going without their\r\nfull meals, that was what none of them were fit to do.  With which it\r\nappeared that the cart was bringing a can of broth, a couple of rabbits,\r\nsome calves\'-feet jelly, and a bottle of port wine for Alfred, who lived\r\non that and cod-liver oil more than on any other nourishment.\r\n\r\nAt that rate, Lady Jane\'s displeasure did not seem likely to do much\r\nharm; but there was pain in it too, for when Mrs. Crabbe had managed to\r\nget up-stairs, past the patch-work quilt that was hung up to shelter Paul\r\nfrom the draught, and had seen Alfred, and been shocked to find how much\r\nwasted he was since she last had seen him, she said, \'One thing you\r\nknow--my Lady says she can\'t have Miss Selby coming down here to see\r\nAlfred while this great lad is always about.  And I\'m sure it is not\r\nproper for her at any time, such a young lady as she is, over all those\r\ninconvenient stiles.  I declare I shall speak to Mr. Price about them.\'\r\n\r\nLosing Miss Jane\'s visits was to Alfred like losing a sunbeam, and his\r\nspirit felt very dreary after he had heard this sentence.  Ellen knew her\r\nwell enough to suspect that she was very sorry, but that she could not\r\nhelp herself; and Mrs. King caught the brother and sister making such\r\ngrumbling speeches to each other about the old lady\'s crossness, that her\r\nfaithful, grateful spirit was quite grieved, and she spoke strongly up\r\nfor the just, right-minded lady to whom she had loyally looked up for\r\nmany and many a year, though, with the right sort of independence, she\r\nwould not give up to any one\'s opinion what she knew to be her duty.\r\n\r\n\'We all knew it must cost us something,\' she said, \'and we\'ll try to be\r\nready with it, though it does go to one\'s heart that the first should be\r\nwhat vexes you, my Alfy; but it won\'t be for long.\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Mother; but if it ain\'t here long?  Oh!  I don\'t seem to have\r\nnothing to look to if Miss Jane ain\'t coming here no more, with her\r\npretty ways!\'\r\n\r\nAnd there were large tears on his cheeks.  Mrs. King had tears in her\r\neyes too, but she bent down over the boy, and turning his eyes to the\r\nlittle picture on the wall, she said in a whisper in his ear, \'Didn\'t He\r\nbear His Cross for the sake of other people?\'  Alfred did not answer; he\r\nturned his face in towards the pillow, and though Ellen thought he was\r\ncrying, it did not seem to her to be so sadly.\r\n\r\nCost them something their kindness did.  To be sure, there came a party\r\nof boys with the master from Ragglesford, when there had been time for\r\nthem to write the history of the robbery to their homes; and as it came\r\njust before the monthly letter which they all had to write by way of\r\npractice, to be shewn up to the master, it was a real treasure to them to\r\nhave such a story to tell.  Some of their friends, especially the uncle\r\nwho gave the watch, had sent small sums of money for the lad who had\r\nbehaved so well, and these altogether came to a fair amount, which the\r\nboys were highly pleased to give over into Mrs. King\'s hands.  She, like\r\nHarold, never made the smallest question that it was all for Paul\'s\r\nbenefit, and though, when she mentioned it to him, he gave a cheery\r\nsmile, and said it would lessen the cost of his illness to her, yet she\r\nput it all aside with the first twelve-and-sixpence.  She told Ellen that\r\nit went against her to touch the orphan\'s money, and that unless it came\r\nto very bad times indeed, it should be kept to set him up decently when\r\nhe should recover.\r\n\r\nNo one else could afford aid in money, not Mr. Cope, for he had little\r\nmore than a maintenance for himself; indeed, Mrs. King was not in a\r\nstation where it would seem becoming to offer alms to her.  Lady Jane\r\ngave help in nourishing food, but the days when this would come were\r\nuncertain, and she had made a resolution against undertaking any share of\r\nthe expense, lest she should seem to encourage Mary King, as she said, in\r\nsuch weak good nature--cramming up her house with a strange boy like\r\nthat, when she had quite enough to do with her own son.  So they had to\r\nfight on as they could; and the first week, when Paul\'s illness was at\r\nthe height, Ellen had so much more to do for Alfred and about the house,\r\nand was so continually called off her work, that she could not finish\r\nMrs. Crabbe\'s gown as soon as was expected; and the ladies\' maid, who was\r\nkept waiting, took huff, and sent her new purple silk to Elbury to be\r\nmadeup.\r\n\r\nIt is not quite certain that Ellen did not shed a few tears.\r\n\r\nHarold had to go without his butter, and once took it much to heart that\r\nhis mother would buy no shrimps for tea, but after some one had whispered\r\nto him that if there were a trouble about rent, or about Mr. Blunt\'s\r\nbill, Peggy would be sold, he bore it all pretty well; and after all,\r\nAlfred and Paul were so apt to give him tastes of their dainties, that he\r\nhad not much loss!\r\n\r\nRent was the care.  The pig was killed and cut up to great advantage;\r\nMrs. King sold a side of it at once, which went a good way towards it,\r\nbut not the whole; and there was a bad debt of John Farden\'s for bread,\r\ncontracted last winter, and which he had never paid off in the summer.\r\nThat would just have made it up, but what hopes were there of that?\r\n\r\nJust then, however, came a parcel from Matilda.  It was her way of\r\nhelping her family to send them the clothes which her mistresses allowed\r\nher to have when they left them off, when Mrs. King either made them up\r\nfor herself or Ellen, or disposed of them at Elbury.\r\n\r\nWhat a treat those parcels were!  How curious were all the party at the\r\nunpacking, looking at the many odd things that were sure to come out, on\r\nthe happy doubtful certainty that each one would be remembered by the\r\ngood sister.\r\n\r\nSo there were the little directed parcels--a neat knitted grey and black\r\nhandkerchief for Mother to wear in the shop; a whole roll of\r\nfashion-books for Ellen, and a nice little pocket-book besides; and a\r\nbundle of \'Illustrated News\' to amuse the boys; a precious little square\r\nbook of \'Hymns for the Sick\' for Alfred; and a famous pair of\r\nriding-gloves, like bears\' paws, for Harold.  And what rolls besides!\r\nWorn flimsy dresses, once pretty, but now only fit for the old-clothes\r\nman, yet whose trimmings Ellen pulled out and studied; bonnets that\r\nlooked as if they had been sat upon; rolls of soft ragged cambric\r\nhandkerchiefs, on which Mrs. King seized as the most valuable part of the\r\ncargo, so useful would they be to poor Alfred; some few real good things,\r\nin especial, a beautiful thick silk dress which had been stained, but\r\nwhich dyeing would render very useful; and a particularly nice grey cloth\r\nmantle, which Matilda had mentioned in her letter as likely to be useful\r\nto Ellen--it was not at all the worse for wear, except as to the lining\r\nof the hood, and she should just fancy Ellen in it.\r\n\r\nEllen could just fancy herself in it.  She had a black silk one, which\r\nhad come in the same way, and looked very well, but it was just turning\r\noff, and it was not warm enough for winter without a shawl under it.  That\r\ngrey looked as if it was made for her, it suited her shoulders and her\r\nshape so well!  She put it on and twisted about in it, and then she saw\r\nher good mother not saying one word, and knew she was thinking of the sum\r\nthat was wanting to the rent.\r\n\r\n\'Well, Mother,\' said Ellen, \'I\'ll go in and take the things to Betsey on\r\nthe next market-day, and if we can get thirty shillings on them without\r\nthe mantle--\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, if you can, my dear,\' said her mother; \'I\'m sure I should be very\r\nglad for you to have it, but you see--\'\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. King sighed.\r\n\r\nEllen passed by Paul on the landing, and saw him with his face flushed\r\nwith pain and fever, trying to smile at her.  She remembered how her\r\nunkind words had brought trouble on him, and how her mother had begun by\r\ntelling her that they must give up their own wishes if they were to nurse\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nEllen went to Elbury on the market-day, and by the help of Betsey\r\nHardman, she got great credit for her bargaining.  She brought home\r\nthirty shillings, and ten shillings\' worth of soap for the shop, where\r\nthat article was running low; but she did not bring home the cloak,\r\nthough Betsey had told her a silk cloak over a shawl looked so mean! and\r\nshe feared all the servants at the Grange would think the same!\r\n\r\n\'They always were good children to me,\' said Mrs. King to Mr. Cope, \'but\r\nsomehow, since Paul has been here, I think they are better than ever!\r\nThere\'s poor Alfred, though his cough has been so bad of late, has been\r\nso thoughtful and so good; he says he\'s quite ashamed to find how patient\r\nPaul is under so much sharper pain than he ever had, and he\'s ready to\r\nsend anything to Paul that he fancies will do him good--quite carried out\r\nof himself, you see; and there\'s Harold, so much steadier; I\'ve hardly\r\nhad to find fault with him since that poor boy made off--he\'s sure to\r\ncome in in time, and takes care not to disturb his brother, and helps his\r\nsister and me all he can.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Cope was not at all surprised that the work of mercy was blessed to\r\nall the little household, nor that it drew out all the better side of\r\ntheir dispositions.\r\n\r\nThere was no positive change, nor sudden resolution, to alter Harold; but\r\nhe had been a good deal startled by Dick\'s wickedness, and in him had\r\nlost a tempter.  Besides, he considered Paul as his own friend, received\r\nfor his sake, and therefore felt himself bound to do all he could for\r\nhim, and though he was no nurse, he could do much to set his mother and\r\nEllen free to attend to their patients.  And Paul\'s illness, though so\r\nmuch less dangerous, frightened and subdued Harold much more than the\r\nquiet gradual pining away of Alfred, to which he was used.  The severe\r\npain, the raging fever, and the ramblings in talk, were much more fearful\r\nthings to witness than the low cough, the wearing sore, and the helpless\r\nlanguor, though there was much hope for the one, and scarcely any for the\r\nother.  While to Harold\'s apprehension, Alfred was always just the same,\r\nonly worsening visibly from month to month; Paul was better or worse\r\nevery time he came in, and when fresh from hearing his breath gasp with\r\nsharp pain, or receiving his feeble thanks for some slight service, it\r\nwas not in Harold to go out and get into thoughtless mischief.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there were helpful things to do at home, such as Harold liked.\r\nHe was fond of chopping wood, so he was very obliging about the oven, and\r\nwhat he liked best of all was helping his mother in certain evening\r\ncookeries of sweet-meats, by receipts from Mrs. Crabbe.  On the day of\r\nthe expedition from Ragglesford, the young gentlemen had found out that\r\nMrs. King\'s bottles contained what they called \'the real article and no\r\nmistake,\' much better than what the old woman at the turnpike sold; and\r\nso they were, for Mrs. King made them herself, and, like an honest woman,\r\nwithout a morsel of sham in them.  She was not going to break the Eighth\r\nCommandment by cheating in a comfit any more than by stealing a purse;\r\nand the children of Friarswood had long known that, and bought all the\r\n\'lollies\' that they were not naughty enough to buy on Sundays, when, as\r\nmay be supposed, her shutters were not shut only for a decent show.\r\n\r\nAnd now Harold did not often ride up to the school without some little\r\nmaster giving him a commission for some variety of sweet-stuff; and\r\nthough Mrs. King used to say it was a pity the children should throw away\r\ntheir money in that fashion, it brought a good deal into her till, and\r\nHarold greatly liked assisting at the manufacture.  How often he licked\r\nhis fingers during the process need not be mentioned; but his objection\r\nto Ragglesford was quite gone off, now that some one was nearly certain\r\nto be looking out for him, with a good-natured greeting, or an inquiry\r\nfor Paul.  He knew one little boy from another, and felt friendly with\r\nthem all, and he really was quite grieved when the holidays came, and\r\nthey wished him good-bye.  The coach that had been hired to take them to\r\nElbury seemed something to watch for now, and some thoughtful boy stopped\r\nall the whooping and hurraing as they came near the house on the bridge.\r\nSome other stopped the coach, and they all came dropping off it like a\r\nswarm of black flies, and tumbling into the shop, where Mrs. King and her\r\ndaughter had need to have had a dozen pair of hands to have served them,\r\nand they did not go till they had cleared out her entire stock of sweet\r\nthings and gingerbread; nay, some of them would have gone off without\r\ntheir change, if she had not raced out to catch them with it after they\r\nwere climbing up the coach, and then the silly fellows said they hated\r\ncoppers!  And meeting Harold and his post-bag on his way home from\r\nElbury, they raised such a tremendous cheer at him that poor Peggy seemed\r\nto make but three springs from the milestone to the bridge, and he could\r\nnot so much as touch his cap by way of answer.\r\n\r\nSomehow, even after those droll customers were gone, every Saturday\'s\r\nreckoning was a satisfactory one.  More always seemed to come in than\r\nwent out.  The potatoes had been unusually free from disease in Mrs.\r\nKing\'s garden, and every one came for them; the second pig turned out\r\nwell; a lodger at the butcher\'s took a fancy to her buns; and on the\r\nwhole, winter, when her receipts were generally at the lowest, was now\r\nquite a prosperous time with her.  The great pressure and near anxiety\r\nshe had expected had not come, and something was being put by every week\r\ntowards the bill for flour, and for Mr. Blunt\'s account, so that she\r\nbegan to hope that after all the Savings Bank would not have to be left\r\nquite bare.\r\n\r\nQuite unexpectedly, John Farden came in for a share of the savings of an\r\nold aunt at service, and, like an honest fellow as he was, he got himself\r\nout of debt at once.  This quite settled all Mrs. King\'s fears; Mr. Blunt\r\nand the miller would both have their due, and she really believed she\r\nshould be no poorer!\r\n\r\nThen she recollected the widow\'s cruse of oil, and tears of thankfulness\r\nand faith came into her eyes, and other tears dropped when she remembered\r\nthe other more precious comfort that the stranger had brought into the\r\nwidow\'s house, but she knew that the days of miracles and cures past hope\r\nwere gone, and that the Christian woman\'s promise was \'that her children\r\nshould come again,\' but not till the resurrection of the just.\r\n\r\nAnd though to her eye each frost was freshly piercing her boy\'s breast,\r\neach warm damp day he faded into greater feebleness, yet the hope was far\r\nclearer.  He was happy and content.  He had laid hold of the blessed hope\r\nof Everlasting Life, and was learning to believe that the Cross laid on\r\nhim here was in mercy to make him fit for Heaven, first making him afraid\r\nand sorry for his sins, and ready to turn to Him Who could take them\r\naway, and then almost becoming gladness, in the thought of following his\r\nMaster, though so far off.\r\n\r\nNot that Alfred often said such things, but they breathed peace over his\r\nmind, and made Scripture-reading, prayers, and hymns very delightful to\r\nhim, especially those in Matilda\'s book; and he dwelt more than he told\r\nany one on Mr. Cope\'s promise, when he trusted to be made more fully \'one\r\nwith Christ\' in the partaking of His Cup of Life.  It used to be his\r\ntreat, when no one was looking, to read over that Service in his Prayer-\r\nbook, and to think of the time.  It was like a kind of step; he could fix\r\nhis mind on that, and the sense of forgiveness he hoped for therein,\r\nbetter than on the great change that was coming; when there was much fear\r\nand shrinking from the pain, and some dread of what as yet seemed strange\r\nand unknown, he thought he should feel lifted up so as to be able to bear\r\nthe thought, when that holy Feast should have come to him.\r\n\r\nAll this made him much less occupied with himself, and he took much more\r\nshare in what was going on; he could be amused and playful, cared for all\r\nthat Ellen and Harold did, and was inclined to make the most of his time\r\nwith his brother.  It was like old happy times, now that Alfred had\r\nceased to be fretful, and Harold took heed not to distress him.\r\n\r\nOne thing to which Alfred looked forward greatly, was Paul\'s being able\r\nto come into his room, and the two on their opposite sides of the wall\r\nmade many pleasant schemes for the talk and reading that were to go on.\r\nBut when the day came, Alfred was more disappointed than pleased.\r\n\r\nPaul had been cased, by Lady Jane\'s orders, in flannel; he had over that\r\na pair of trousers of Alfred\'s--much too long, for the Kings were very\r\ntall, and he was small and stunted in growth--and a great wrapping-gown\r\nthat Mr. Cope had once worn when he was ill at college, and over his\r\nshaven head a night-cap that had been their father\'s.\r\n\r\nEllen, with many directions from Alfred, had made him up a couch with\r\nthree chairs, and the cushions Alfred used to have when he could leave\r\nhis bed; the fire was made up brightly, and Mrs. King and Harold helped\r\nPaul into the room.\r\n\r\nBut all the rheumatic pain was by no means over, and walking made him\r\nfeel it; he was dreadfully weak, and was so giddy and faint after the\r\nfirst few steps, that they could not bring him to shake hands with Alfred\r\nas both had wished, but had to lay him down as fast as they could.  So\r\ntired was he, that he could hardly say anything all the time he was\r\nthere; and Alfred had to keep silence for fear of wearying him still\r\nmore.  There was a sort of shyness, too, which hindered the two from even\r\nletting their eyes meet, often as they had heard each other\'s voices, and\r\nhad greeted one another through the thin partition.  As Paul lay with his\r\neyes shut, Alfred raised himself to take a good survey of the sharp\r\npinched features, the hollow cheeks, deep-sunk pits for the eyes,--and\r\nyellow ghastly skin of the worn face, and the figure, so small and wasted\r\nthat it was like nothing, curled up in all those wraps.  One who could\r\nread faces better than young Alfred could, would have gathered not only\r\nthat the boy who lay there had gone through a great deal, but that there\r\nwas much mind and thought crushed down by misery, and a gentle nature not\r\nfit to stand up alone against it, and so sinking down without exertion.\r\n\r\nAnd when Alfred was learning a verse of his favourite hymn--\r\n\r\n   \'There is a rill whose waters rise--\'\r\n\r\nPaul\'s eye-lids rose, and looked him all over dreamily, comparing him\r\nperhaps with the notions he had carried away from his two former\r\nglimpses.  Alfred did not look now so utterly different from anything he\r\nhad seen before, since Mrs. King and Ellen had been hovering round his\r\nbed for nearly a month past; but still the fair skin, pink colour, dark\r\neye-lashes, glossy hair, and white hands, were like a dream to him, as if\r\nthey belonged to the pure land whither Alfred was going, and he was quite\r\nloath to hear him speak like another boy, as he knew he could do, having\r\noften listened to his talk through the wall.  At the least sign of\r\nAlfred\'s looking up, he turned away his eyes as if he had been doing\r\nsomething by stealth.\r\n\r\nHe came in continually after this; and little things each day, and\r\nHarold\'s talk, made the two acquainted and like boys together; but it was\r\nnot till Christmas Day that they felt like knowing each other.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time Paul felt himself able to be of any use, for he was\r\nto be left in charge of Alfred, while Mrs. King and both her other\r\nchildren went to church.  Paul was sadly crippled still, and every frost\r\nfilled his bones with acute pain, and bent him like an old man, so that\r\nhe was still a long way from getting down-stairs, but he could make a\r\nshift to get about the room, and he looked greatly pleased when Alfred\r\ndeclared that he should want nobody else to stay with him in the morning.\r\n\r\nVery glad he was that his mother would not be kept from Ellen\'s first\r\nHoly Communion.  Owing to the Curate not being a priest, the Feast had\r\nnot been celebrated since Michaelmas; but a clergyman had come to help\r\nMr. Cope, that the parish might not be deprived of the Festival on such a\r\nday as Christmas.\r\n\r\nHarold, though in a much better mood than at the Confirmation time, was\r\nnot as much concerned to miss it as perhaps he ought to have been.\r\nThought had not come to him yet, and his head was full of the dinner with\r\nthe servants at the Grange.  It was sad that he and Ellen should alone be\r\nable to go to it; but it would be famous for all that!  Ay, and so were\r\nthe young postman\'s Christmas-boxes!\r\n\r\nSo Paul and Alfred were left together, and held their tongues for full\r\nfive minutes, because both felt so odd.  Then Alfred said something about\r\nreading the Service, and Paul offered to read it to him.\r\n\r\nPaul had not only been very well taught, but had a certain gift, such as\r\nnot many people have, for reading aloud well.  Alfred listened to those\r\nPsalms and Lessons as if they had quite a new meaning in them, for the\r\nright sound and stress on the right words made them sound quite like\r\nanother thing; and so Alfred said when he left off.\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure they do to me,\' said Paul.  \'I didn\'t know much about "good-\r\nwill to men" last Christmas.\'\r\n\r\n\'You\'ve not had overmuch good-will from them, neither,\' said Alfred,\r\n\'since you came out.\'\r\n\r\n\'What! not since I\'ve been at Friarswood?\' exclaimed Paul.  \'Why, I used\r\nto think all _that_ was only something in a book.\'\r\n\r\n\'All what?\' asked Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'All about--why, loving one\'s neighbour--and the Good Samaritan, and so\r\non.  I never saw any one do it, you know, but it was comfortable like to\r\nread about it; and when I watched to your mother and all of you, I saw\r\nhow it was about one\'s neighbour; and then, what with that and Mr. Cope\'s\r\nteaching, I got to feel how it was--about God!\' and Paul\'s face looked\r\nvery grave and peaceful.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Alfred, \'I don\'t know as I ever cared about it much--not\r\nsince I was a little boy.  It was the fun last Christmas.\'\r\n\r\nAnd Paul looking curious, Alfred told all about the going out for holly,\r\nand the dining at the Grange, and the snap-dragon over the pudding, till\r\nhe grew so eager and animated that he lost breath, and his painful cough\r\ncame on, so that he could just whisper, \'What did you do?\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh!  I don\'t know.  We had prayers, and there was roast beef for dinner,\r\nbut they gave it to me where it was raw, and I couldn\'t eat it.  Those\r\nthat had friends went out; but \'twasn\'t much unlike other days.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor Paul!\' sighed Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'It won\'t be like that again, though,\' said Paul, \'even if I was in a\r\nUnion.  I know--what I know now.\'\r\n\r\n\'And, Paul,\' said Alfred, after a pause, \'there\'s one thing I should like\r\nif I was you.  You know our Blessed Saviour had no house over Him, but\r\nwas left out of the inn, and nobody cared for Him.\'\r\n\r\nPaul did not make any answer; and Alfred blushed all over.\r\n\r\nPresently Alfred said, \'Harold will run in soon.  I say, Paul, would you\r\nmind reading me what they will say after the Holy Sacrament--what the\r\nAngels sang is the beginning.\'\r\n\r\nPaul found it, and felt as if he must stand to read such praise.\r\n\r\n\'Thank you,\' said Alfred.  \'I\'m glad Mother and Ellen are there.  They\'ll\r\nremember us, you know.  Did you hear what Mr. Cope promised me?\'\r\n\r\nPaul had not heard; and Alfred told him, adding, \'It will be the Ember-\r\nweek in Lent.  You\'ll be one with me then, Paul?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'d like to promise,\' said Paul fervently; \'but you see, when I\'m well--\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, you won\'t go away for good.  My Lady, or Mr. Cope, will get you\r\nwork; and I want you to be Mother\'s good son instead of me; and a brother\r\nto Harold and Ellen.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'d never go if I could help it,\' said Paul; \'I sometimes wish I\'d never\r\ngot better!  I wish I could change with you, Alfred; nobody would care if\r\n\'twas me; nor I\'m sure I shouldn\'t.\'\r\n\r\n\'I should like to get well!\' said Alfred slowly, and sighing.  \'But then\r\nyou\'ve been a much better lad than I was.\'\r\n\r\n\'I don\'t know why you should say that,\' said Paul, with his hand under\r\nhis chin, rather moodily.  \'But if I thought I could be good and go on\r\nwell, I would not mind so much.  I say, Alfred, when people round go on\r\nbeing--like Tom Boldre, you know--do you think one can always feel that\r\nabout God being one\'s Father, and church home, and all the rest?\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t say--I never tried,\' said Alfred.  \'But you know you can always\r\ngo to church--and then the Psalms and Lessons tell you those things.\r\nWell, and you can go to the Holy Sacrament--I say, Paul, if you take it\r\nthe first time with me, you\'ll always remember me again every time\r\nafter.\'\r\n\r\n\'I must be very odd ever to forget you!\' said Paul, not far from crying.\r\n\'Ha!\' he exclaimed, \'they are coming out of church!\'\r\n\r\n\'I want to say one thing more, while I\'ve got it in my head,\' said\r\nAlfred.  \'Mr. Cope said all this sickness was a cross to me, and I\'d got\r\nto take it up for our Saviour\'s sake.  Well, and then mayn\'t yours be\r\nbeing plagued and bullied, without any friends?  I\'m sure something like\r\nit happened to our Lord; and He never said one word against them.  Isn\'t\r\nthat the way you may be to follow Him?\'\r\n\r\nIllness and thought had made such things fully plain to Alfred, and his\r\nwords sank deep into Paul\'s mind; but there was not time for any answer,\r\nfor Harold was heard unlocking the door, and striding up three steps at a\r\ntime, sending his voice before him.  \'Well, old chaps, have you\r\nquarrelled yet?  Have you been jolly together?  I say, Mrs. Crabbe told\r\nEllen that the pudding was put into the boiler at eight o\'clock last\r\nnight; and my Lady and Miss Jane went in to give it a stir!  I\'m to bring\r\nyou home a slice, you know; and Paul will know what a real pudding is\r\nlike.\'\r\n\r\nThe two boys spent a happy quiet afternoon with Mrs. King; and Charles\r\nHayward brought all the singing boys down, that they might hear the\r\ncarols outside the window.  Paul, much tired, was in his bed by that\r\ntime; but his last thought was that \'Good-will to Men\' had come home to\r\nhim at last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI--BETTER DAYS FOR PAUL\r\n\r\n\r\nPaul\'s reading was a great prize to Alfred, for he soon grew tired\r\nhimself; his sister could not spare time to read to him, and if she did,\r\nshe went mumbling on like a bee in a bottle.  Her mother did much the\r\nsame, and Harold used to stumble and gabble, so that it was horrible to\r\nhear him.  Such reading as Paul\'s was a new light to them all, and was a\r\ntreat to Ellen as she worked as much as to Alfred; and Paul, with hands\r\nas clean as Alfred\'s, was only too happy to get hold of a book, and\r\ninfinitely enjoyed the constant supply kept up by Miss Selby, to make up\r\nfor her not coming herself.\r\n\r\nThen came the making out the accounts, a matter dreaded by all the\r\nfamily.  Ellen and Alfred both used to do the sums; but as they never\r\nmade them the same, Mrs. King always went by some reckoning of her own by\r\npencil dots on her thumb-nail, which took an enormous time, but never\r\nwent wrong.  So the slate and the books came up after tea, one night, and\r\nEllen set to work with her mother to pick out every one\'s bill.  There\r\nmight be about eight customers who had Christmas bills; but many an\r\naccountant in a London shop would think eight hundred a less tough\r\nbusiness than did the King family these eight; especially as there was a\r\ndebtor and creditor account with four, and coals, butcher\'s meat, and\r\nshoes for man and horse, had to be set against bread, tea, candles, and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\nOne pound of tea, 3_s._ 6_d._, that was all very well; but an ounce and a\r\nhalf of the same made Ellen groan, and look wildly at the corner over\r\nAlfred\'s bed, as if in hopes she should there see how to set it down, so\r\nas to work it.\r\n\r\n\'Fourpence, all but--\' said a voice from the arm-chair by the fire.\r\n\r\nEllen did not take any particular heed, but announced the fact that three\r\nshillings were thirty-six pence, and six was forty-two.  Also that\r\nsixteen ounces were one pound, and sixteen drams one ounce; but there she\r\ngot stuck, and began making figures and rubbing them out, as if in hopes\r\nthat would clear up her mind.  Mrs. King pecked on for ten minutes on her\r\nnail.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' she said, \'Paul\'s right; it is fourpence.\'\r\n\r\n\'However did you do it?\' asked Ellen.\r\n\r\n\'As 16 to 1.5, so 42,\' quoth Paul quickly.  \'Three halves into 42; 21 and\r\n42 is 63; 63 by 16, gives 3 and fifteen-sixteenths.  You can\'t deduct a\r\nsixteenth of a penny, so call it fourpence.\'\r\n\r\nEllen and Alfred were as wise as to the working as they were before.\r\n\r\nNext question--Paul\'s answer came like the next line in the book--Mrs.\r\nKing proved him right, and so on till she was quite tired of the proofs,\r\nand began to trust him.  Alfred asked how he could possibly do such\r\nthings, which seemed to him a perfect riddle.\r\n\r\n\'I should have had my ears pretty nigh pulled off if I took five minutes\r\nto work _that_ in my head,\' said Paul.  \'But I\'ve forgotten things now; I\r\ncould do it faster once.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure you hadn\'t need,\' said Mrs. King; \'it\'s enough to distract\r\none\'s senses to count so fast.  All in your poor head too!\'\r\n\r\n\'And I\'ve got to write them all out to-morrow,\' said Ellen dismally; \'I\r\nmust wait till dark, or I shan\'t set a stitch of work.  I wish people\r\nwould pay ready money, and then one wouldn\'t have to set down their\r\nbills.  Here\'s Mr. Cope, bread--bread--bread, as long as my arm!\'\r\n\r\n\'If you didn\'t mind, maybe I could save you the trouble, Miss Ellen,\'\r\nsaid Paul.\r\n\r\n\'Did you ever make out a bill?\' asked Mrs. King.\r\n\r\n\'Never a real one; but every Thursday I used to do sham ones.  Once I did\r\na jeweller\'s bill for twelve thousand pounds and odd!  It is so long\r\nsince I touched a pen, that may be I can\'t write; but I should like to\r\ntry.\'\r\n\r\nEllen brought a pen, and the cover of a letter; and hobbling up to the\r\ntable, he took the pen, cleared it of a hair that was sticking in it,\r\nmade a scratch or two weakly and ineffectually, then wrote in a neat\r\nclear hand, without running up or down, \'Friarswood, Christmas.\'\r\n\r\n\'A pretty hand as ever I saw!\' said Mrs. King.  \'Well, if you can write\r\nlike that, and can be trusted to make no mistakes, you might write out\r\nour bills; and we\'d be obliged to you most kindly.\'\r\n\r\nAnd so Paul did, so neatly, that when the next evening Mr. Cope walked in\r\nwith the money, he said, looking at Harold, \'Ah! my ancient Saxon, I must\r\nmake my compliments to you: I did not think you could write letters as\r\nwell as you can carry them.\'\r\n\r\n\'\'Twas Paul did it, Sir,\' said Harold.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, Sir; \'twas Paul,\' said Mrs. King.  \'The lad is a wonderful scholar:\r\nhe told off all the sums as if they was in print; and to hear him\r\nread--\'tis like nothing I ever heard since poor Mrs. Selby, Miss Jane\'s\r\nmother.\'\r\n\r\n\'I saw he had been very well instructed--in acquaintance with the Bible,\r\nand the like.\'\r\n\r\n\'And, Sir, before I got to know him for a boy that would not give a false\r\naccount of himself, I used to wonder whether he could have run away from\r\nsome school, and have friends above the common.  If you observe, Sir, he\r\nspeaks so remarkably well.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Cope had observed it.  Paul spoke much better English than did even\r\nthe Kings; though Ellen was by way of being very particular, and\r\nsometimes a little mincing.\r\n\r\n\'You are quite sure it is not so?\' he said, a little startled at Mrs.\r\nKing\'s surmise.\r\n\r\n\'Quite sure now, Sir.  I don\'t believe he would tell a falsehood on no\r\naccount; and besides, poor lad!\' and she smiled as the tears came into\r\nher eyes, \'he\'s so taken to me, he wouldn\'t keep nothing back from me, no\r\nmore than my own boys.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m sure he ought not, Mrs. King,\' said the Curate, \'such a mother to\r\nhim as you have been.  I should like to examine him a little.  With so\r\nmuch education, he might do something better for himself than\r\nfield-labour.\'\r\n\r\n\'A very good thing it would be, Sir,\' said Mrs. King, looking much\r\ncheered; \'for I misdoubt me sometimes if he\'ll ever be strong enough to\r\ngain his bread that way--at least, not to be a good workman.  There! he\'s\r\nnot nigh so tall as Harold; and so slight and skinny as he is, going\r\nabout all bent and slouching, even before his illness!  Why, he says what\r\nmade him stay so long in the Union was that he looked so small and young,\r\nthat none of the farmers at Upperscote would take him from it; and so at\r\nlast he had to go on the tramp.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Cope went up-stairs, and found Ellen, as usual, at her needle, and\r\nPaul in the arm-chair close by Alfred, both busied in choosing and\r\ncutting out pictures from Matilda\'s \'Illustrated News,\' with which Harold\r\nornamented the wall of the stair-case and landing.  Mr. Cope sat down,\r\nand made them laugh with something droll about the figures that were\r\nlying spread on Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'So, Paul,\' he said, \'I find Mrs. King has engaged you for her\r\naccountant.\'\r\n\r\n\'I wish I could do anything to be of any use,\' said Paul.\r\n\r\n\'I\'ve half a mind to ask you some questions in arithmetic,\' said Mr.\r\nCope, with his merry eyes upon the boy, and his mouth looking grave;\r\n\'only I\'m afraid you might puzzle me.\'\r\n\r\n\'I can\'t do as I used, Sir,\' said Paul, rather nervously; \'I\'ve forgotten\r\never so much; and my head swims.\'\r\n\r\nThe slate was lying near; Mr. Cope pushed it towards him, and said,\r\n\'Well, will you mind letting me see how you can write from dictation?\'\r\n\r\nAnd taking up one of the papers, he read slowly several sentences from a\r\ndescription of a great fire, with some tolerably long-winded newspaper\r\nwords in them.  When he paused, and asked for the slate, there it all\r\nstood, perfectly spelt, well written, and with all the stops and capitals\r\nin the right places.\r\n\r\n\'Famously done, Paul!  Well, and do you know where this place was?\'\r\nnaming the town.\r\n\r\nPaul turned his eyes about for a moment, and then gave the name of a\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\n\'That\'ll do, Paul.  Which part of England?\'\r\n\r\n\'Midland.\'\r\n\r\nAnd so on, Mr. Cope got him out of his depth by asking about the rivers,\r\nand made him frown and look teased by a question about a battle fought in\r\nthat county.  If he had ever known, he had forgotten, and he was weak and\r\neasily confused; but Mr. Cope saw that he had read some history and\r\nlearnt some geography, and was not like some of the village boys, who\r\nused to think Harold had been called after Herod--a nice namesake, truly!\r\n\r\n\'Who taught you all this, Paul?\' he said.  \'You must have had a cleverer\r\nmaster than is common in Unions.  Who was he?\'\r\n\r\n\'He was a Mr. Alcock, Sir.  He was a clever man.  They said in the House\r\nthat he had been a bit of a gentleman, a lawyer, or a clerk, or\r\nsomething, but that he could never keep from the bottle.\'\r\n\r\n\'What! and so they keep him for a school-master?\'\r\n\r\n\'He was brought in, Sir; he\'d got that mad fit that comes of drink, Sir,\r\nand was fresh out of gaol for debt.  And when he came to, he said he\'d\r\nkeep the school for less than our master that was gone.  He couldn\'t do\r\nanything else, you see.\'\r\n\r\n\'And how did he teach you?\'\r\n\r\n\'He knocked us about,\' said Paul, drawing his shoulders together with an\r\nunpleasant recollection; \'he wasn\'t so bad to me, because I liked getting\r\nmy tasks, and when he was in a good humour, he\'d say I was a credit to\r\nhim, and order me in to read to him in the evening.\'\r\n\r\n\'And when he was not?\'\r\n\r\n\'That was when he\'d been out.  They said he\'d been at the gin-shop; but\r\nhe used to be downright savage,\' said Paul.  \'At last he never thought it\r\nworth while to teach any lessons but mine, and I used to hear the other\r\nclasses; but the inspector came all on a sudden, and found it out one day\r\nwhen he\'d hit a little lad so that his nose was bleeding, and so he was\r\nsent off.\'\r\n\r\n\'How long ago was this?\'\r\n\r\n\'Going on for a year,\' said Paul.\r\n\r\n\'Didn\'t the inspector want you to go to a training-school?\' said Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'Yes; but the Guardians wouldn\'t hear of it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did you wish it?\' asked Mr. Cope.\r\n\r\n\'I liked my liberty, Sir,\' was the answer; and Paul looked down.\r\n\r\n\'Well, and what you do think now you\'ve tried your liberty?\'\r\n\r\nPaul didn\'t make any answer, but finding that good-humoured face still\r\nwaiting, he said slowly, \'Why, Sir, it was well-nigh the worst of all to\r\nfind I was getting as stupid as the cows.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Cope laughed, but not so as to vex him; and added, \'So that was the\r\nway you learnt to be a reader, Paul.  Can you tell me what books you used\r\nto read to this master?\'\r\n\r\nPaul paused; and Alfred said, \'"Uncle Tom\'s Cabin," Sir; he told us the\r\nstory of that.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Paul; \'but that wasn\'t all: there was a book about Paris, and\r\nall the people in the back lanes there; and a German prince who came, and\r\nwas kind.\'\r\n\r\n\'You must not tell them stories out of that book, Paul,\' said Mr. Cope\r\nquickly, for he knew it was a very bad one.\r\n\r\n\'No, Sir,\' said Paul; \'but most times it was books he called philosophy,\r\nthat I couldn\'t make anything of--no story, and all dull; but he was very\r\nsavage if I got to sleep over them, till I hated the sight of them.\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m glad you did, my poor boy,\' said Mr. Cope.  \'But one thing more.\r\nTell me how, with such a man as this, you could have learnt about the\r\nBible and Catechism, as you have done.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh,\' said Paul, \'we had only the Bible and Testament to read in the\r\nschool, because they were the cheapest; and the chaplain asked us about\r\nthe Catechism every Sunday.\'\r\n\r\n\'What was the chaplain\'s name?\'\r\n\r\nPaul was able, with some recollection, to answer; but he knew little\r\nabout the clergyman, who was much overworked, and seldom able to give any\r\ntime to the paupers.\r\n\r\nThree days after, Mr. Cope again came into the post-office.\r\n\r\n\'Well, Mrs. King, I suppose you don\'t need to be told that our friend\r\nPaul has spoken nothing but truth.  The chaplain sends me his baptismal\r\nregistry, for which I asked.  Just seventeen he must be--a foundling,\r\npicked up at about three weeks old, January 25th, 1836.  They fancy he\r\nwas left by some tramping musicians, but never were able to trace them--at\r\nleast, so the chaplain hears from some of the people who remember it.\r\nBeing so stunted, and looking younger than he is, no farmer would take\r\nhim from the House, and the school-master made him useful, so he was kept\r\non till the grand exposure that he told us of.\'\r\n\r\n\'Ah!  Sir,\' said Mrs. King,\' I\'m afraid that master was a bad man.  I\r\nonly wonder the poor lad learnt no more harm from him!\'\r\n\r\n\'One trembles to think of the danger,\' said Mr. Cope; \'but you see\r\nthere\'s often a guard over those who don\'t seek the temptation, and\r\nperhaps this poor fellow\'s utter ignorance of anything beyond the Union\r\nwalls helped him to let the mischief pass by his understanding, better\r\nthan if he had had any experience of the world.\'\r\n\r\n\'I doubt if he\'ll ever have that, Sir,\' said Mrs. King, her sensible face\r\nlighting up rather drolly; \'there\'s Harold always laughing at him for\r\nbeing so innocent, and yet so clever at his book.\'\r\n\r\n\'So much the better for him,\' said Mr. Cope.  \'The Son of Sirach never\r\nsaid a wiser word than that "the knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom."\r\nWhy, Mrs. King, what have I said? you look as if you had a great mind to\r\nlaugh at me.\'\r\n\r\n\'I beg your pardon, Sir,\' said Mrs. King, much disconcerted at what\r\nseemed to her as if it might have been disrespect, though that was only\r\nMr. Cope\'s droll way of putting it, \'I never meant--\'\r\n\r\n\'Well, but what were you thinking of?\'\r\n\r\n\'Why, Sir, I beg your pardon, but I was thinking it wouldn\'t have been\r\namiss if he had had sense enough to keep himself clean and tidy.\'\r\n\r\n\'I agree with you,\' said Mr. Cope, laughing, and seeing she used\r\n\'innocent\' in a slightly different sense from what he did; \'but perhaps\r\nUnion cleanliness was not inviting, and he\'d not had you to bring him up\r\nto fresh cheeks like Harold\'s.  Besides, I believe it was half depression\r\nand want of heart to exert himself, when there was no one to care for\r\nhim; and he certainly had not been taught either self-respect, or to\r\nthink cleanliness next to godliness.\'\r\n\r\n\'Poor lad--no,\' said Mrs. King; \'nor I don\'t think he\'d do it again, and\r\nI trust he\'ll never be so lost again.\'\r\n\r\n\'Lost, and found,\' said Mr. Cope gravely.  \'Another thing I was going to\r\nsay was, that this irreverent economy of the Guardians, in allowing no\r\nlesson-books but the Bible, seems to have, after all, been blest to him\r\nin his knowledge of it, like an antidote to the evil the master poured\r\nin.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, Sir,\' said Mrs. King, \'just so; only he says, that though he liked\r\nit, because, poor lad, there was nothing else that seemed to him to speak\r\nkind or soft, he never knew how much it was meant for him, nor it didn\'t\r\nseem to touch him home till he came to you, Sir.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Cope half turned away.  His bright eyes had something very like a\r\ntear in them, for hardly anything could have been said to make the young\r\nclergyman so happy, as to tell him that any work of his should be\r\nblessed; but he went on talking quickly, to say that the chaplain gave a\r\nstill worse account of Alcock than Paul\'s had been, saying that some\r\ngentlemen who had newly become Guardians at the time of the inspector\'s\r\nvisit, had taken up the matter, and had been perfectly shocked at the\r\ndiscoveries they had made about the man to whom the poor children had\r\nbeen entrusted.\r\n\r\nOn his dismissal, some of the old set, who were all for cheapness, had\r\ntalked of letting young Blackthorn act as school-master; but as he was so\r\nvery young, and had been brought up by this wretched man, the gentlemen\r\nwould not hear of it; and as they could not afford to accept the\r\ninspector\'s offer of recommending him to a government school, he had been\r\nsent out in quest of employment, as being old enough to provide for\r\nhimself.  Things had since, the chaplain said, been put on a much better\r\nfooting, and he himself had much more time to attend to the inmates.  As\r\nto Paul, he was glad to hear that he was in good hands; he said he had\r\nalways perceived him to be a very clever boy, and knew no harm of him but\r\nthat he was a favourite with Alcock, which he owned had made him very\r\nglad to get him out of the House, lest he should carry on the mischief.\r\n\r\nMr. Cope and Mrs. King were both of one mind, that this was hard measure.\r\nSo it was.  Man\'s measure always is either over hard or over soft,\r\nbecause he cannot see all sides at once.  Now they saw Paul\'s side, his\r\nsimplicity, and his suffering; the chaplain had only seen the chances of\r\nhis conveying the seeds of ungodly teaching to the workhouse children; he\r\ncould not tell that the pitch which Paul had not touched by his own will,\r\nhad not stuck by him--probably owing to that very simplicity which had\r\nmade him so helpless in common life.\r\n\r\nHaving learnt all this, Mr. Cope proposed to Paul to use the time of his\r\nrecovery in learning as much as he could, so as to be ready in case any\r\nopportunity should offer for gaining his livelihood by his head rather\r\nthan by his hands.\r\n\r\nPaul\'s face glowed.  He liked nothing better than to be at a book, and\r\nwith Mr. Cope to help him by bright encouragements and good-natured\r\nexplanations instead of tweaks of the ears and raps on the knuckles, what\r\ncould be pleasanter?  So Mr. Cope lent him books, set him questions, and\r\ngave him pen, ink, and copy-book, and he toiled away with them till his\r\nsenses grew dazed, and his back ached beyond bearing; so that \'Mother,\'\r\nas he called her now, caught him up, and made him lie on his bed to rest,\r\nthreatening to tell Mr. Cope not to set him anything so hard; while Ellen\r\nwatched in wonder at any one being so clever, and was proud of whatever\r\nMr. Cope said he did well; and Harold looked on him as a more\r\nextraordinary creature than the pie-bald horse in the show, who wore a\r\nhat and stood on his hind legs, since he really was vexed when book and\r\nslate were taken out of his hands.\r\n\r\nHe would have over-tasked himself in his weakness much more, if it had\r\nnot been for his lovingness to Alfred.  To please Alfred was always his\r\nfirst thought; and even if a difficult sum were just on the point of\r\nproving itself, he would leave off at the first moment of seeing Alfred\r\nlook as if he wanted to be read to, and would miss all his calculations,\r\nto answer some question--who was going down the village, or what that\r\nnoise could be.\r\n\r\nAlfred tried to be considerate, and was sorry when he saw by a furrow on\r\nPaul\'s brow that he was trying to win up again all that some trifling\r\nsaying had made him lose.  But Alfred was not scholar enough to perceive\r\nthe teasing of such interruptions, and even had he been aware of it, he\r\nwas not in a state when he could lie quite still long together without\r\ndisturbing any one; he could amuse himself much less than formerly, and\r\noften had most distressing restless fits, when one or other of them had\r\nto give him their whole attention; and it was all his most earnest\r\nefforts could do to keep from the old habit of fretfulness and murmuring.\r\nAnd he grieved so much over the least want of temper, and begged pardon\r\nso earnestly for the least impatient word--even if there had been real\r\nprovocation for it--that it was a change indeed since the time when he\r\nthought grumbling and complaint his privilege and relief.  Nothing helped\r\nhim more than Paul\'s reading Psalms to him--the 121st was his\r\nfavourite--or saying over hymns to him in that very sweet voice so full\r\nof meaning.  Sometimes Ellen and Paul would sing together, as she sat at\r\nher work, and it almost always soothed him to hear the Psalm tunes, that\r\nwere like an echo from the church, about which he had cared so little\r\nwhen he had been able to go there in health and strength, but for which\r\nhe now had such a longing!  He came to be so used to depend on their\r\nsinging the Evening Hymn to him, that one of the times when it was most\r\nhard for him to be patient, was one cold evening, when Ellen was so\r\nhoarse that she could not speak, and an unlucky draught in from the shop\r\ndoor had so knit Paul up again, that he was lying in his bed, much nearer\r\nscreaming than singing.\r\n\r\nMost of all, however, was Alfred helped by Mr. Cope\'s visits, and the\r\nlooking forward to the promised Feast, with more earnestness as the time\r\ndrew on, and he felt his own weakness more longing for the support and\r\nblessing of uniting his suffering with that of his Lord.  \'In all our\r\nafflictions He was afflicted,\' was a sound that came most cheeringly to\r\nhim, and seemed to give him greater strength and good-will to bear his\r\nload of weakness.\r\n\r\nThere was a book which young Mrs. Selby had given his mother, which was\r\noften lying on his bed, and had marks in it at all the favourite places.\r\nSome he liked to look at himself, some for Paul to read to him.  They\r\nwere such sentences as these:\r\n\r\n\'My son, I descended from Heaven for thy salvation; I took upon Me thy\r\nmiseries; not necessity, but charity, drawing Me thereto, that thou\r\nthyself mightest learn patience, and bear temporal miseries without\r\ngrudging.\'\r\n\r\n\'For from the hour of My Birth, even until My Death on the Cross, I was\r\nnot without suffering and grief.\'\r\n\r\nAnd then again:\r\n\r\n\'Offer up thyself unto Me, and give thyself wholly for God, and thy\r\noffering shall be acceptable.\'\r\n\r\n\'Behold, I offered up Myself wholly unto My Father for thee, and gave My\r\nwhole Body and Blood for thy food, that I might be wholly thine, and that\r\nthou mightest continue Mine unto the end.\'\r\n\r\nSo he might think of all that he went through as capable of being made a\r\nfree offering, which God would accept for the sake of the One Great\r\nOffering, \'consuming and burning away\' (as the book said) \'all his sins\r\nwith the fire of Christ\'s love, and cleansing his conscience from all\r\noffences.\'  It was what he now felt in the words, \'Thy Will be done,\'\r\nwhich he tried to say in full earnest; but he thought he should be very\r\nhappy when he should go along with the offering ourselves, our souls, and\r\nbodies, to be a \'reasonable, holy, and lively sacrifice.\'\r\n\r\nEach of Mr. Cope\'s readings brought out or confirmed these refreshing\r\nhopes; and Paul likewise dwelt on such thoughts.  Hardship had been a\r\ntraining to him, like sickness for Alfred; he knew what it was to be\r\nweary and heavy laden, and to want rest, and was ready to draw closer to\r\nthe only Home and Father that he could claim.  His gentle unresisting\r\nspirit was one that so readily forgot ill-will, that positively Harold\r\ncherished more dislike to the Shepherds than he did; and there was no\r\nstruggle to forgive, no lack of charity for all men, so that hope and\r\ntrust were free.\r\n\r\nThese two boys were a great deal to the young deacon.  Perhaps he\r\nreckoned on his first ministration as a priest by Alfred\'s bedside, as\r\nmuch or even more than did the lad, for to him the whole household were\r\nas near and like-minded friends, though neither he nor they ever departed\r\nfrom the fitting manners of their respective stations.  He was one who\r\nliked to share with others what was near his heart, and he had shewn\r\nAlfred the Service for the Ordination of Priests, and the Prayers for\r\nGrace that would be offered, and the holy vows that he would take upon\r\nhim, and the words with which those great Powers would be conferred--those\r\nPowers that our Chief Shepherd left in trust for the pastors who feed His\r\nflock.\r\n\r\nAnd once he had bent down and whispered to Alfred to pray that help might\r\nbe given to him to use those powers faithfully.\r\n\r\nSo wore on the early spring; and the morning had come when he was to set\r\nout for the cathedral town, when Harold rode up to the parsonage door,\r\nand something in his looks as he passed the window made Mr. Cope hasten\r\nto the door to meet him.\r\n\r\n\'O Sir!\' said Harold, bursting out crying as he began to speak, \'poor\r\nAlfred is took so bad; and Mother told me to tell you, Sir--if he\'s not\r\nbetter--he\'ll never live out the day!\'\r\n\r\nPoor Harold, who had never seemed to heed his brother\'s illness, was\r\nquite overwhelmed now.  It had come upon him all at once.\r\n\r\n\'What is it?  Has the doctor been?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Sir; I went in at six o\'clock this morning to ask him to come out,\r\nand he said he\'d come--and sent him a blister--but Alf was worse by the\r\ntime I got back, Sir,--he can\'t breathe--and don\'t seem to notice.\'\r\n\r\nAnd without another word, nor waiting for comfort, Harold dug his heels\r\ninto Peggy, passed his elbow over his eyes, and cantered on with the\r\ntears drying on his face in the brisk March wind.\r\n\r\nThere was no finishing breakfast for the Curate; he thrust his letters\r\ninto his pocket, caught up his hat, and walked off with long strides for\r\nthe post-office.\r\n\r\nIt shewed how different things were from usual, that Paul, who had hardly\r\nyet been four times down-stairs, his thin pointed face all in a flush,\r\nwas the only person in the shop, trying with a very shaky hand to cut out\r\nsome cheese for a great stout farm maid-servant, who evidently did not\r\nunderstand what was the matter, and stared doubly when the clergyman put\r\nhis strong hand so as to steady Paul\'s trembling one, and gave his help\r\nto fold up the parcel.\r\n\r\n\'How is he, Paul?\'\r\n\r\nPaul was very near crying as he answered, \'Much worse, Sir.  Mother has\r\nbeen up all night with him.  O Sir! he did so want to live till you came\r\nhome.\'\r\n\r\n\'May I go up?\' asked Mr. Cope.\r\n\r\nPaul was sure that he might, and crept up after him.  It was bad enough,\r\nbut not quite so bad as Harold, in his fright, had made Mr. Cope believe.\r\nPoor boy! it had all come upon him now; and seeing his brother unable to\r\nspeak and much oppressed, he fancied he did not know him, whereas Alfred\r\nwas fully sensible, though too ill to do more than lift his eyes, and put\r\nout his weak fingers as Mr. Cope came into the room, where he was lying\r\nraised on his pillows, with his mother and sister doing all they could\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\nA terrible pain in the side had come on in the night, making every breath\r\npainful, every cough agonizing, and his whole face and brow were crimson\r\nwith the effort of gasping.\r\n\r\nPaul looked a moment but could not bear it, and went, and sat down on the\r\ntop of the stairs; while Mr. Cope kindly held Alfred\'s hot hand, and Mrs.\r\nKing, in her low patient tone, told how the attack had begun.\r\n\r\nShe was in the midst, when Mr. Blunt\'s gig was seen at the gate.  His\r\nhaving thus hastened his coming was more than they had dared to hope; and\r\nwhile Mrs. King felt grateful for the kindness, Ellen feared that it\r\nshewed that he thought very badly of the case.\r\n\r\nMr. Cope was much hurried, but he could not bear to go till he had heard\r\nMr. Blunt\'s opinion; so he went down to the kitchen, tried to console\r\nPaul by talking kindly to him, wrote a note, and read his letters.\r\n\r\nThey were much comforted to hear that Mr. Blunt thought that there was\r\nhope of subduing the present inflammatory pain; and though there was much\r\nimmediate danger, it was not hastening so very fast to the end as they\r\nhad at first supposed.  Yet, in such a state as Alfred\'s, a few hours\r\nmight finish all.  There was no saying.\r\n\r\nAlready, when Mr. Cope went up again, the remedies had given some relief;\r\nand though the breaths came short and hard, like so many stabs, Alfred\r\nhad put his head into an easier position, and his eyes and lips looked\r\nmore free to look a greeting.  There was so much wistful earnestness in\r\nhis face, and it deeply grieved Mr. Cope to be forced to leave him, and\r\nin too much haste even to be able to pray with him.\r\n\r\n\'Well, Alfred, dear fellow,\' he said, his voice trembling, \'I am come to\r\nwish you good-bye.  I am comforted to find that Mr. Blunt thinks there is\r\ngood hope that you will be here--that we shall be together when I come\r\nback.  Yes, I know that is what is on your mind, and I do reckon most\r\nearnestly on it; but if it should not be His Will--here, Ellen, will you\r\ntake care of this note?  If he should be worse, will you send this to Mr.\r\nCarter, at Ragglesford? and I know he will come at once.\'\r\n\r\nThe dew stood on Alfred\'s eye-lashes, and his lips worked.  He looked up\r\nsadly to Mr. Cope, as if this did not answer his longings.\r\n\r\nMr. Cope replied to the look--\'Yes, dear boy, but if it cannot be, still\r\nremember it is Communion.  He can put us together.  We all drink into one\r\nSpirit.  I shall be engaged in a like manner--I would not--I could not\r\ngo, Alfred, for pleasure--no, nor business--only for this.  You must\r\nthink that I am gone to bring you home the Gift--the greatest, best\r\nGift--the one our Lord left with His disciples, to bear them through\r\ntheir sorrows and pains--through the light affliction that is but for a\r\nmoment, but worketh an exceeding weight of glory.  And if I should not be\r\nin time,\' he added, nearly sobbing as he spoke, \'then--then, Alfred, the\r\nGift, the blessing is yours all the same.  It is the Great High Priest to\r\nWhom you must look--perhaps you may do so the more really if it should\r\nnot be through--your friend.  If we are disappointed, we will make a\r\nsacrifice of our disappointment.  Good-bye, my boy; God bless you!\'\r\nBending close down to his face, he whispered, \'Think of me.  Pray for\r\nme--now--always.\'  Then, rising hastily, he shook the hands of the mother\r\nand sister, ran down-stairs, and was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII--REST AT LAST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe east wind had been swept aside by gales from the warm south, and the\r\nspring was bursting out everywhere; the sky looked softly blue, instead\r\nof hard and chill; the sun made everything glisten: the hedges were full\r\nof catkins; white buds were on the purple twigs of the blackthorns;\r\nprimroses were looking out on the sunny side of the road; the larks were\r\nmounting up, singing as if they were wild with delight; and the sunbeams\r\nwere full of dancing gnats, as the Curate of Friarswood walked, with\r\nquick eager steps, towards the bridge.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were anxiously bent on the house, watching the white smoke\r\nrising from the chimney; then he hastened on to gain the first sight at\r\nthe upper windows, feeling almost as he could have done had it been a\r\nbrother who lay there; so much was his heart set on the first whom he had\r\nstriven to help through the valley of the shadow of death.  The window\r\nwas open, but the blind was not drawn; and almost at the same moment the\r\ngate opened, some one looked out, and seeing him, waved his hand and arm\r\nin joyful signal towards some one within, and this gesture set Mr. Cope\'s\r\nheart at rest.\r\n\r\nWas it Harold?  No, it was Paul Blackthorn, who stood leaning on the\r\nwicket, as he held it open for the clergyman, at whom he looked up as if\r\nexpecting some change, and a little surprised to find the same voice and\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\'Well, Paul, then he is not worse?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, Sir, thank you, he is better.  The pain has left him, and he can\r\nspeak again,\' said Paul, but not very cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\'That is a great comfort!  But who\'s that?\' as a head, not Ellen\'s,\r\nappeared for a moment at the window.\r\n\r\n\'That\'s Miss King, Sir--Miss Matilda!\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh!  Well, and how are the bones, Paul?  Better, I hope, since I see you\r\nare come out with the bees,\' said Mr. Cope, laying his hand kindly on his\r\nshoulder (a thing fit to touch now, since it was in a fustian coat of\r\npoor Alfred\'s), and accommodating his swift strong steps to the feeble\r\nhalt with which Paul still moved.\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, Sir, yes; I\'ve been down here twice when the sun was out,\' he\r\nsaid, as if it were a grand undertaking; but then, with a sudden smile,\r\n\'and poor Caesar knew me, Sir; he came right across the road, and wagged\r\nhis tail, and licked my hand.\'\r\n\r\n\'Good old Caesar!  You were his best friend, Paul.--Well, Mrs. King, this\r\nis a blessing!\'\r\n\r\nMrs. King looked sadly worn out with nursing, and her eyes were full of\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\'Yes, Sir,\' she said, \'indeed it is.  My poor darling has been so much\r\nafraid he was too much set on your coming home, and yet so patient and\r\nquiet about it.\'\r\n\r\n\'Then you ventured to wait?\'\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Cope heard that the attack of inflammation had given way to\r\nremedies, but that Alfred was so much weakened, that they could not raise\r\nhim again.  He was sustained by as much nourishment as they could give\r\nhim: but the disease had made great progress, and Mr. Blunt did not think\r\nthat he could last many days.  His eldest sister had come for a fortnight\r\nfrom her place, and was a great comfort to them all.  \'And so is Paul,\'\r\nsaid Mrs. King, looking for him kindly; \'I don\'t know what we should do\r\nwithout his help up-stairs and down.  And, Sir, yesterday,\' she added,\r\ncolouring a good deal--\'I beg your pardon, but I thought, maybe, you\'d\r\nlike to hear it--Alfred would have nobody else up with him in morning\r\nchurch-time--and made him read the most--of that Service, Sir.\'\r\n\r\nMr. Cope\'s eyes glistened, and he said something huskily of being glad\r\nthat Alfred could think of it.\r\n\r\nIt further appeared that Alfred had wished very much to see Miss Selby\r\nagain, and that Mrs. King had sent the two sisters to the Grange to talk\r\nit over with Mrs. Crabbe, and word had been sent by Harold that morning\r\nthat the young lady would come in the course of the afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. Cope followed Mrs. King up-stairs; Alfred\'s face lighted up as his\r\nsister Matilda made way for the clergyman.  He was very white, and his\r\nbreath was oppressed; but his look had changed very much--it had a\r\nstrange, still sort of brightness and peace about it.  He spoke in very\r\nlow tones, just above a whisper, and smiled as Mr. Cope took his hand,\r\nand spoke to him.\r\n\r\n\'Thank you, Sir.  It is very nice,\' he said.\r\n\r\n\'I thank God that He has let you wait for me,\' said Mr. Cope.\r\n\r\n\'I am glad,\' said Alfred.  \'I did want to pray for it; but I thought,\r\nperhaps, if it was not His Will, I would not--and then what you said.  And\r\nnow He is making it all happy.\'\r\n\r\n\'And you do not grieve over your year of illness?\'\r\n\r\n\'I would not have been without it--no,\' said Alfred, very quietly, but\r\nwith much meaning.\r\n\r\n\'"It is good for me that I have been in trouble," is what you mean,\' said\r\nMr. Cope.\r\n\r\n\'It has made our Saviour seem--I mean--He is so good to me,\' said Alfred\r\nfervently.\r\n\r\nBut talking made him cough, and that brought a line in the fair forehead\r\nso full of peace.  Mr. Cope would not say more to him, and asked his\r\nmother whether the Feast, for which he had so much longed, should be on\r\nthe following day.  She thought it best that it should be so; and Alfred\r\nagain said, \'Thank you, Sir,\' with the serene expression on his face.  Mr.\r\nCope read a Psalm and a prayer to him, and thinking him equal to no more,\r\nwent away, pausing, however, for a little talk with Paul in the shop.\r\n\r\nPaul did not say so, but, poor fellow, he had been rather at a loss since\r\nMatilda had come.  In herself, she was a very good, humble, sensible\r\ngirl; but she wore a dark silk dress, and looked, moved, and spoke much\r\nmore like a lady than Ellen: Paul stood in great awe of her, and her\r\npresence seemed all at once to set him aloof from the others.\r\n\r\nHe had been like one of themselves for the last three months, now he felt\r\nthat he was like a beggar among them; he did not like to call Mrs. King\r\nmother, lest it should seem presuming; Ellen seemed to be raised up the\r\nsame step as her sister, and even Alfred was almost out of his reach;\r\nMatilda read to him, and Paul\'s own good feeling shewed him that he would\r\nbe only in the way if he spent all his time in Alfred\'s room as formerly;\r\nso he kept down-stairs in the morning, and went to bed very early.  Nobody\r\nwas in the least unkind to him: but he had just begun to grieve at being\r\na burden so long, and to wonder how much longer he should be in getting\r\nhis health again.  And then it might be only to be cast about the world,\r\nand to lose his one glimpse of home kindness.  Poor boy! he still cried\r\nat the thought of how happy Alfred was.\r\n\r\nHe did all he could to be useful, but he could scarcely manage to stoop\r\ndown, could carry nothing heavy, and moved very slowly; and he now and\r\nthen made a dreadful muddle in the shop, when a customer was not like\r\nMrs. Hayward, who told him where everything was, and the price of all she\r\nwanted, as well as Mrs. King could do herself.  He could sort the letters\r\nand see to the post-office very well; and for all his blunders, he did so\r\nmuch by his good-will, that when Mrs. King wanted to cheer him up, she\r\ndeclared that he saved her all the expense of having in a woman from the\r\nvillage to help, and that he did more about the house than Harold.\r\n\r\nThis was true: for Harold did not like doing anything but manly things,\r\nas he called them; whereas Paul did not care what it was, so that it\r\nsaved trouble to her or Ellen.\r\n\r\nTalking and listening to Harold was one use of Paul.  Now that it had\r\ncome upon him, and he saw Alfred worse from day to day, the poor boy was\r\nquite broken-hearted.  Possibly, when at his work, or riding, he managed\r\nto shake off the remembrance; but at home it always came back, and he\r\ncried so much at the sight of Alfred, and at any attempt of his brother\r\nto talk to him, that they could scarcely let him stay ten minutes in the\r\nroom.  Then, when Paul had gone to bed on the landing at seven o\'clock,\r\nhe would come and sit on his bed, and talk, and cry, and sob about his\r\nbrother, and his own carelessness of him, often till his mother came out\r\nand ordered him down-stairs to his own bed in the kitchen; and Paul\r\nturned his face into the pillow to weep himself to sleep, loving Alfred\r\nvery little less than did his brother, but making less noise about it,\r\nand feeling very lonely when he saw how all the family cared for each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Cope\'s kind manner came all the more pleasantly to him; and after\r\nsome talk on what they both most cared about, Mr. Cope said, \'Paul, Mr.\r\nShaw of Berryton tells me he has a capital school-master, but in rather\r\nweak health, and he wants to find a good intelligent youth to teach under\r\nhim, and have opportunities of improving himself.  Five pounds a year,\r\nand board and lodgings.  What do you think of it, Paul?\'\r\n\r\nPaul\'s sallow face began growing red, and he polished the counter, on\r\nwhich he was leaning; then, as Mr. Cope repeated, \'Eh, Paul?\' he said\r\nslowly, and in his almost rude way, \'They wouldn\'t have me if they knew\r\nhow I\'d been brought up.\'\r\n\r\n\'Perhaps they would if they knew what you\'ve come to in spite of bringing\r\nup.  And,\' added Mr. Cope, \'they are not so much pressed for time but\r\nthat they can wait till you\'ve quite forgotten your tumble into the\r\nRagglesford.  We must fatten you--get rid of those spider-fingers, and\r\nyou and I must do a few more lessons together--and I think Mrs. King has\r\nsomething towards your outfit; and by Whitsuntide, I told Mr. Shaw that I\r\nthought I might send him what I call a very fair sample of a good steady\r\nlad.\'\r\n\r\nPaul did not half seem to take it in--perhaps he was too unhappy, or it\r\nsounded like sending him away again; or, maybe, such a great step in life\r\nwas more than he could comprehend, after the outcast condition to which\r\nhe had been used: but Mr. Cope could not go on talking to him, for the\r\nGrange carriage was stopping at the gate, and Matilda and Ellen were both\r\ncoming down-stairs to receive Miss Jane.  Poor little thing, she looked\r\nvery pale and nervous; and as she shook hands with the Curate, as he met\r\nher in the garden-path, she said with a startled manner, \'Oh!  Mr.\r\nCope--were you there?  Am I interrupting--?\'\r\n\r\n\'Not at all,\' he said.  \'I had only called in as I came home, and had\r\njust come down again.\'\r\n\r\n\'Is it--is it very dreadful?\' murmured Jane, with a sort of gasp.  She\r\nwas so entirely unused to scenes of sadness or pain, that it was very\r\nstrange and alarming to her, and it was more difficult than ever to\r\nbelieve her no younger than Ellen.\r\n\r\n\'Very far from dreadful or distressing,\' said Mr. Cope kindly, for he\r\nknew it was not her fault that she had been prevented from overcoming\r\nsuch feelings, and that this was a great effort of kindness.  \'It is a\r\nvery peaceful, soothing sight--he is very happy, and not in a suffering\r\nstate.\'\r\n\r\n\'Oh, will you tell Grandmamma?\' said Jane, with her pretty look of\r\nearnestness; \'she is so much afraid of its much for me, and she was so\r\nkind in letting me come.\'\r\n\r\nSo Miss Selby went on to the two sisters, and Mr. Cope proceeded to the\r\ncarriage, where Lady Jane had put out her head, glad to be able to ask\r\nhim about the state of affairs.  Having nothing but this little grand-\r\ndaughter left to her, the old lady watched over her with almost\r\nover-tender care, and was in much alarm both lest the air of the sick-\r\nroom should be unwholesome, or the sight too sorrowful for her; and\r\nthough she was too kind to refuse the wish of the dying boy, she had come\r\nherself, in order that \'the child,\' as she called her, might not stay\r\nlonger than was good for her; and she was much relieved to hear Mr.\r\nCope\'s account of Alfred\'s calm state, and of the freshness of the clean\r\nroom, in testimony of which he pointed to the open window.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' she said, \'I hope Mary King was wise enough; but I hardly knew how\r\nit might be with such a number about the house--that boy and all.  He is\r\nnot gone, is he?\'\r\n\r\n\'No, he is not nearly well enough yet, though he does what he can to be\r\nuseful to her.  When he is recovered, I have a scheme for him.\'\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Cope mentioned Mr. Shaw\'s proposal, by which my Lady set more\r\nstore than did Paul as yet.  Very kind-hearted she was, though she did\r\nnot fancy adopting chance-comers into her parish; and as long as he was\r\nnot saddled upon Mary King, as she said, she was very glad of any good\r\nfor him; so she told Mr. Cope to come to her for what he might want to\r\nfit him out properly for the situation; and turning her keen eyes on him\r\nas he stood near the cottage door, pronounced that, after all, he was a\r\nnice, decent-looking lad enough, which certainly her Ladyship would not\r\nhave said before his illness.\r\n\r\nMiss Jane did not stay long.  Indeed, Alfred could not talk to her, and\r\nshe did not know what to say to him; she could only stand by his bed,\r\nwith the tears upon her cheeks, making little murmuring sounds in answer\r\nto Mrs. King, who said for her son what she thought he wished to have\r\nsaid.  Meanwhile, Jane was earnestly looking at him, remarking with awe,\r\nthat, changed as he was since she had last seen him--so much more wasted\r\naway--the whole look of his face was altered by the gentleness and peace\r\nthat it had gained, so as to be like the white figure of a saint.\r\n\r\nShe could not bear it when Mrs. King told her Alfred wanted to thank her\r\nfor all her kindness in coming to see him.  \'Oh, no,\' she said, \'I was\r\nnot kind at all;\' and her tears would not be hindered.  \'Only, you know,\r\nI could not help it.\'\r\n\r\nAlfred gave her a bright look.  Any one could see what a pleasure it was\r\nto him to be looking at her again, though he did not repent of his share\r\nin the sacrifice for Paul\'s sake.  No, if Paul had been given up that\r\nMiss Jane might come to him, Alfred would not have had the training that\r\nmade all so sweet and calm with him now.  He turned his head to the\r\nlittle picture, and said, \'Thank you, Ma\'am, for that.  That\'s been my\r\nfriend.\'\r\n\r\n\'Yes, indeed it has, Miss Jane,\' said his mother.  \'There\'s nothing you\r\never did for him that gave him the comfort that has been.\'\r\n\r\n\'And please, Ma\'am,\' said Alfred, \'will you tell my Lady--I give her my\r\nduty--and ask her pardon for having behaved so bad--and Mrs. Crabbe--and\r\nthe rest?\'\r\n\r\n\'I will, Alfred; but every one has forgiven that nonsense long ago.\'\r\n\r\n\'It was very bad of me,\' said Alfred, pausing for breath; \'and so it was\r\nnot to mind you--Miss Jane--when you said I was ill for a warning.\'\r\n\r\n\'Did I?\' said Jane.\r\n\r\n\'Yes--in hay-time--I mind it--I didn\'t mind for long--but \'twas true.  He\r\nhad patience with me.\'\r\n\r\nThe cough came on, and Jane knew she must go; her grandmother had bidden\r\nher not to stay if it were so, and she just ventured to squeeze Alfred\'s\r\nhand, and then went down-stairs, checking her tears, to wish Matilda and\r\nEllen good-bye; and as she passed by Paul, told him not to uncover his\r\nstill very short-haired head, and kindly hoped he was better.\r\n\r\nPaul, in his dreary feelings, hardly thought of Mr. Cope\'s plan, till, as\r\nhe was getting the letters ready for Harold, he turned up one in Mr.\r\nCope\'s writing, addressed to the \'Rev. A. Shaw, Berryton, Elbury.\'\r\n\r\n\'That\'s to settle for me, then,\' he said; and Harold who was at tea,\r\nasking, \'What\'s that?\' he explained.\r\n\r\n\'Well,\' said Harold, \'every one to his taste!  I wouldn\'t go to school\r\nagain, not for a hundred pounds; and as to _keeping_ school!\'  (Such a\r\nface as he made really caused Paul to smile.)  \'Nor you don\'t half like\r\nit, neither,\' continued Harold.  \'Come, you\'d better stay and get work\r\nhere!  I\'d sooner be at the plough-tail all day, than poke out my eyes\r\nover stuff like that,\' pointing to Paul\'s slate, covered with figures.\r\n\'Here, Nelly,\' as she moved about, tidying the room, \'do you hear?  Mr.\r\nCope\'s got an offer of a place for Paul--five pounds a year, and board\r\nand lodging, to be school-master\'s whipper-in, or what d\'ye call it?\'\r\n\r\n\'What do you say, Harold?\' cried Ellen, putting her hands on the back of\r\na chair, quite interested.  \'You going away, Paul?\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Cope says so--and I must get my living, you know,\' said Paul.\r\n\r\n\'But not yet; you are not well enough yet,\' said the kind girl.  \'And\r\nwhere did you say--?\'\r\n\r\n\'To Berryton.\'\r\n\r\n\'Berryton--oh! that\'s just four miles out on the other side of Elbury,\r\nwhere Susan Congleton went to live that was housemaid at the Grange.  She\r\nsays it\'s such a nice place, and such beautiful organ and singing at\r\nchurch!  And what did you say you were to be, Paul?\'\r\n\r\n\'I\'m to help the school-master.\'\r\n\r\n\'Gracious me!\' cried Ellen.  \'Why, such a scholar as you are, you\'ll be\r\nquite a gentleman yet, Paul.  Why, they school-masters get fifty or sixty\r\npounds salaries sometimes.  I protest it\'s the best thing I\'ve heard this\r\nlong time!  Was it Mr. Cope\'s doing, or my Lady\'s?\'\r\n\r\n\'Mr. Cope\'s,\' said Paul, beginning to think he had been rather less\r\ngrateful than he ought.\r\n\r\n\'Ah! it is like him,\' said Ellen, \'after all the pains he has taken with\r\nyou.  And you\'ll not be so far off, Paul: you\'ll come to see us in the\r\nholidays, you know.\'\r\n\r\n\'To be sure he will,\' said Harold; \'or if he don\'t, I shall go and fetch\r\nhim.\'\r\n\r\n\'Of course he will,\' said Ellen, with her hand on Paul\'s chair, and\r\nspeaking low and affectionately to console him, as she saw him so\r\ndowncast; \'don\'t you know how poor Alfy says he\'s come to be instead of a\r\nson to Mother, and a brother to us?  I must go up and tell Alf and\r\nmother.  They\'ll be so pleased.\'\r\n\r\nPaul felt very differently about the plan now.  All the house\r\ncongratulated him upon it, and Matilda evidently thought more of him now\r\nthat she found he was to have something to do.  But such things as these\r\nwere out of sight beside that which was going on in the room above.\r\n\r\nAlfred slept better that night, and woke so much revived, that they\r\nthought him better: and Harold, greatly comforted about him, stood\r\ntolerably quietly by his side, listening to one or two things that Alfred\r\nhad longed for months past to say to him.\r\n\r\n\'Promise me, Harold dear, that you\'ll be a good son to Mother: you\'ll be\r\nthe only one now.\'\r\n\r\nHarold made a bend of his head like a promise.\r\n\r\n\'O Harold, be good to her!\' went on Alfred earnestly; \'she\'s had so much\r\ntrouble!  I do hope God will leave you to her--if you are steady and\r\ngood.  Do, Harold!  She\'s not like some, as don\'t care what their lads\r\nget to.  And don\'t take after me, and be idle!  Be right-down good,\r\nHarold, as Paul is; and when you come to be ill--oh! it won\'t be so bad\r\nfor you as it was for me!\'\r\n\r\n\'I do want to be good,\' sighed Harold.  \'If I\'d only been confirmed; but\r\n\'twas all along of them merries last summer!\'\r\n\r\n\'And I was such a plague to you--I drove you out,\' said Alfred.\r\n\r\n\'No, no, I was a brute to you!  Oh! Alfy, Alfy, if I could only get back\r\nthe time!\'\r\n\r\nHe was getting to the sobs that hurt his brother; and his sister was\r\ngoing to interfere; but Alfred said:\r\n\r\n\'Never mind, Harold dear, we\'ve been very happy together, and we\'ll\r\nalways love each other.  You\'ll not forget Alf, and you\'ll be Mother\'s\r\ngood son to take care of her!  Won\'t you?\'\r\n\r\nSo Harold gave that promise, and went away with his tears.  Poor fellow,\r\nnow was his punishment for having slighted the Confirmation.  Like Esau,\r\nan exceeding bitter cry could not bring back what he had lightly thrown\r\naway.  Well was it for him that this great sorrow came in time, and that\r\nit was not altogether his birthright that he had parted with.  He found\r\nhe could not go out to his potato-planting and forget all about it, as he\r\nwould have liked to have done--something would not let him; and there he\r\nwas sitting crouched up and sorrowful on the steps of the stairs, when\r\nMr. Cope and all the rest were gathered in Alfred\'s room, a church for\r\nthe time.  Matilda and Ellen had set out the low table with the fair\r\nwhite cloth, and Mr. Cope brought the small cups and paten, which were\r\ndoubly precious to him for having belonged to his father, and because the\r\nlast time he had seen them used had been for his father\'s last Communion.\r\n\r\nNow was the time to feel that a change had really passed over the young\r\npastor in the time of his absence.  Before, he could only lead Alfred in\r\nhis prayers, and give him counsel, tell him to hope in his repentance,\r\nand on what that hope was founded.  Now that he had bent beneath the hand\r\nof the Bishop, he had received, straight down from the Twelve, the Power\r\nfrom on High.  It was not Mr. Cope, but the Lord Who had purchased that\r\nPardon by His own most Precious Blood, Who by him now declared to Alfred\r\nthat the sins and errors of which he had so long repented, were pardoned\r\nand taken away.  The Voice of Authority now assured him of what he had\r\nbeen only told to hope and trust before.  And to make the promise all the\r\nmore close and certain, here was the means of becoming a partaker of the\r\nSacrifice--here was that Bread and that Cup which shew forth the Lord\'s\r\nDeath till He come.  It was very great rest and peace, the hush that was\r\nover the quiet room, with only Alfred\'s hurried breath to be heard beside\r\nMr. Cope\'s voice as he spoke the blessed words, and the low responses of\r\nthe little congregation.  Paul was close beside Alfred--he would have him\r\nthere between his mother and the wall--and the two whose first Communion\r\nit was, were the last to whom Mr. Cope came.  To one it was to be the\r\nFood for the passage into the unseen world; to the other might it be the\r\nfirst partaking of the Manna to support him through the wilderness of\r\nthis life.\r\n\r\n\'From the highways and hedges,\' here was one brought into the foretaste\r\nof the Marriage Supper.  Ah! there was one outside, who had loved idle\r\npleasure when the summons had been sent to him.  Perhaps the misery he\r\nwas feeling now might be the means of sparing him from missing other\r\ncalls, and being shut out at last.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to fulfil all that Alfred had wished.  He lay still between\r\nwaking and sleeping for a long time afterwards, and then begged for Paul\r\nto read to him the last chapters of the Book of Revelation.  Matilda\r\nwished to read them for him; but he said, \'Paul, please.\'  Paul\'s voice\r\nwas fuller and softer when it was low; his accent helped the sense, and\r\nAlfred was more used to them than to his visitor sister.  Perhaps there\r\nwas still another reason, for when Paul came to the end, and was turning\r\nthe leaves for one of Alfred\'s favourite bits, he saw Alfred\'s eyes on\r\nhim, as if he wanted to speak.  It was to say, \'Brothers quite now, Paul!\r\nThank you.  I think God must have sent you to help me.\'\r\n\r\nAlfred seemed better all the evening, and they went to bed in good\r\nspirits; but at midnight, Mr. Cope, who was very deeply studying and\r\npraying, the better to fit himself for his new office in the ministry,\r\nwas just going to shut his book, and go up to bed, when he heard a\r\ntremulous ring at the bell.\r\n\r\nIt was Harold, his face looking very white in the light from Mr. Cope\'s\r\ncandle.\r\n\r\n\'Oh! please, Sir,\' he said, \'Alfred is worse; and Mother said, if your\r\nlight wasn\'t out, you\'d like to know.\'\r\n\r\n\'I am very grateful to her,\' said Mr. Cope; and taking up his plaid, he\r\nwrapped one end round the boy, and put his arm round him, as he felt him\r\nquaking as Paul had done before, but not crying--too much awe-struck for\r\nthat.  He said that his mother thought something had broken in the lungs,\r\nand that he would be choked.  Mr. Cope made the more haste, that he might\r\njudge if the doctor would be of any use.\r\n\r\nPaul was sitting up in his bed--they had not let him get up--but his eyes\r\nwere wide open with distress, as he plainly heard the loud sob that each\r\nbreath had become.  Mrs. King was holding Alfred up in her arms; Matilda\r\nwas trying to chafe his feet; Ellen was kneeling with her face hidden.\r\n\r\nThe light of sense and meaning was not gone from Alfred\'s eyes, though\r\nthe last struggle had come.  He gave a look as though he were glad to see\r\nMr. Cope, and then gazed on his brother.  Mrs. King signed to Harold to\r\ncome nearer, and whispered, \'Kiss him.\'  His sisters had done so, and he\r\nhad missed Harold.  Then Mr. Cope prayed, and Alfred\'s eyes at first\r\nowned the sounds; but soon they were closed, and the long struggling\r\nbreaths were all that shewed that the spirit was still there.\r\n\r\n\'He shall swallow up death in victory, and the Lord God shall wipe away\r\ntears from all eyes.\'\r\n\r\nOne moment, and the blue eyes they knew so well were opened and smiling\r\non his mother, and then--\r\n\r\nIt was over; and through affliction and pain, the young spirit had gone\r\nto rest!\r\n\r\nThe funeral day was a very sore one to Paul Blackthorn.  He would have\r\ngiven the world to be there, and have heard the beautiful words of hope\r\nwhich received his friend to his resting-place, but he could not get so\r\nfar.  He had tried to carry a message to a house not half so far off as\r\nthe church, but his knees seemed to give way under him, and his legs\r\nached so much that he could hardly get home.  Somehow, a black suit, just\r\nsuch as Harold\'s, had come home for him at the same time; but this could\r\nnot hinder him from feeling that he was but a stranger, and one who had\r\nno real place in the home where he lived.  There was the house full of\r\npeople, who would only make their remarks on him--Miss Hardman (who was\r\nvery critical of the coffin-plate), the school-master, and some of the\r\nupper-servants of the house--and poor Mrs. King and Matilda, who could\r\nnot help being gratified at the attention to their darling, were obliged\r\nto go down and be civil to them; while Ellen, less used to restraint, was\r\nshut into her own room crying; and Harold was standing on the stairs,\r\nvery red, but a good deal engaged with his long hat-band.  Poor Paul! he\r\nhad not even his usual refuge--his own bed to lie upon and hide his\r\nface--for that had been taken away to make room for the coffin to be\r\ncarried down.\r\n\r\nThere, they were going at last, when it had seemed as if the bustle and\r\nconfusion would never cease.  There was Alfred leaving the door where he\r\nhad so often played, carried upon the shoulders of six lads in white\r\nfrocks, his old school-fellows and Paul\'s Confirmation friends.  How Paul\r\nenvied them for doing him that last service!  There was his mother,\r\nalways patient and composed, holding Harold\'s arm--Harold, who must be\r\nher stay and help, but looking so slight, so boyish, and so young, then\r\nthe two girls, Ellen so overpowered with crying that her sister had to\r\nlead her; Mrs. Crabbe with Betsey Hardman, who held up a great white\r\nhandkerchief, for other people\'s visible grief always upset her, as she\r\nsaid; and besides, she felt it a duty to cry at such a time; and the rest\r\ntwo and two, quite a train, in their black suits: how unlike the dreary\r\npauper funerals Paul had watched away at Upperscote!  That respectable\r\nlook seemed to make him further off and more desolate, like one cut off,\r\nwhom no one would follow, no one would weep for.  Alfred, who had called\r\nhim a brother, was gone, and here he was alone!\r\n\r\nThe others were taking their dear one once more to the church where they\r\nhad so often prayed that he might have a happy issue out of all his\r\nafflictions.\r\n\r\nThey were met by Mr. Cope, ending his loving intercourse with Alfred by\r\nreading out the blessed promise of Resurrection--the assurance that the\r\nbody they were sowing in weakness would be raised in power; so that the\r\nnoble boy, whom they had seen fade away like a drooping flower, would\r\nrise again blossoming forth in glory, after the Image of the\r\nIncorruptible--that Image, thought Mr. Cope, as he read on, which he\r\nfaithfully strove to copy even through the sufferings due to the\r\ncorruptible.  His voice often shook and faltered.  He had never before\r\nread that Service; and perhaps, except for those of his own kin, it could\r\nnever be a greater effort to him, going along with Alfred as he had done,\r\nholding up the rod and staff that bore him through the dark valley.  And\r\neach trembling of his tone seemed to answer something that the mother was\r\nfeeling in her peaceful, hopeful, thankful grief--yes, thankful that she\r\ncould lay her once high-spirited and thoughtless boy in his grave, with\r\nthe same sure and certain hope of a joyful Resurrection, as that ripe and\r\nearnest-minded Christian his father, or his little innocent brother.  It\r\nwas peace--awful peace, indeed, but soothing even to Ellen and Harold,\r\nnew as they were to grief.\r\n\r\nBut to poor Paul at home, out of hearing of the words of hope, only\r\nlistening to the melancholy toll of the knell, and quite alone in the\r\ndisarranged forlorn house, there seemed nothing to take off the edge of\r\nmisery.  He was not wanted to keep Alfred company now, nor to read to\r\nhim--no one needed him, no one cared for him.  He wandered up to where\r\nAlfred had lain so long, as if to look for the pale quiet face that used\r\nto smile to him.  There was nothing but the bed-frame and mattress!  He\r\nthrew himself down on it and cried.  He did not well know why--perhaps\r\nthe chief feeling was that Alfred was gone away to rest and bliss, and he\r\nwas left alone to be weary and without a friend.\r\n\r\nAt last the crying began to spend itself, and he turned and looked up.\r\nThere was Alfred\'s little picture of the Crucified still on the wall, and\r\nthe words under it, \'For us!\'  Paul\'s eye fell on it; and somehow it\r\nbrought to mind what Alfred had said to him on Christmas Day.  There was\r\nOne Who had no home on earth; there was One Who had made Himself an\r\noutcast and a wanderer, and Who had not where to lay His Head.  Was not\r\nHe touched with a fellow-feeling for the lonely boy?  Would He not help\r\nhim to bear his friendless lot as a share of His own Cross?  Nay, had He\r\nnot raised him up friends already in his utmost need?  \'There is a Friend\r\nWho sticketh closer than a brother.\'  He was the Friend that Paul need\r\nnever lose, and in Whom he could still meet his dear Alfred.  These\r\nthoughts, not quite formed, but something like them, came gently as balm\r\nto the poor boy, and though they brought tears even thicker than the\r\nfirst burst of lonely sorrow, they were as peaceful as those shed beside\r\nthe grave.  Though Paul was absent in the body, this was a very different\r\nshutting out from Harold\'s on last Tuesday.\r\n\r\nPaul must have cried himself to sleep, for he did not hear the funeral-\r\nparty return, and was first roused by Mrs. King coming up-stairs.  He had\r\nbeen so much used to think of this as Alfred\'s room, that he had never\r\nrecollected that it was hers; and now that she was come up for a moment\'s\r\nbreathing-time, he started up ashamed and shocked at being so caught.\r\n\r\nBut good motherly Mrs. King saw it all, and how he had been weeping where\r\nher child had so long rested.  Indeed, his face was swelled with crying,\r\nand his voice all unsteady.\r\n\r\n\'Poor lad! poor lad!\' she said kindly, \'you were as fond of him as any of\r\nthem; and if we wanted anything else to make you one of us, that would do\r\nit.\'\r\n\r\n\'O Mother,\' said Paul, as she kindly put her hand on him, \'I could not\r\nbear it--I was so lost--till I looked at _that_,\' pointing to the little\r\nprint.\r\n\r\n\'Ay,\' said Mrs. King, as she wiped her quiet tears, \'that Cross was\r\nAlfred\'s great comfort, and so it is to us all, my boy, whatever way we\r\nhave to carry it, till we come to where he is gone.  No cross, no crown,\r\nthey say.\'\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was not bad for any one that this forlorn day had given Paul a\r\nfresh chill, which kept him in bed for nearly a week, so as gently to\r\nbreak the change from her life of nursing to Mrs. King, and make him very\r\nhappy and peaceful in her care.\r\n\r\nAnd when at last on a warm sunny Sunday, Paul Blackthorn returned thanks\r\nin church for his recovery--ay, and for a great deal besides--he had no\r\nreason to think that he was a stranger cared for by no one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII--SIX YEARS LATER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful morning in Easter week.  The sun is shining on the\r\ngilded weathercock, which flashes every time it veers from south to west;\r\nthe snowdrops are getting quite out of date, and the buttercups and\r\nprimroses have it all their own way; the grass is making a start, and\r\ngetting quite long upon the graves in Friarswood churchyard.\r\n\r\n\'Really, I should have sent in the Saxon monarch to tidy us up!\' says to\r\nhimself the tall young Rector, as he stepped over the stile with one long\r\nstride; \'but I suppose he is better engaged.\'\r\n\r\nThat tall young Rector is the Reverend Marcus Cope, six years older, but\r\nyoung still.  The poor old Rector, Mr. John Selby, died four years ago\r\nabroad; and Lady Jane and Miss Selby\'s other guardians gave the living to\r\nMr. Cope, to the great joy of all the parish, except the Shepherds, who\r\nhave never forgiven him for their own usage of their farming boy, nor for\r\nthe sermon he neither wrote nor preached.\r\n\r\nThe Saxon monarch means one Harold King, who looks after the Rectory\r\ngarden and horse, as well as the post-office and other small matters.\r\n\r\nThe clerk is unlocking the church, and shaking out the surplice, and Mr.\r\nCope goes into the vestry, takes out two big books covered with green\r\nparchment, and sees to the pen.  It is a very good one, judging by the\r\nwriting of the last names in that book.  They are Francis Mowbray and\r\nJane Arabella Selby.\r\n\r\n\'Captain and Mrs. Mowbray will be a great blessing to the place, if they\r\ngo on as they have begun,\' thinks Mr. Cope.  \'How happy they are making\r\nold Lady Jane, and how much more Mrs. Mowbray goes among the cottages now\r\nthat she does more as she pleases.\'\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Cope goes to the porch and looks out.  He sees two men getting\r\nover the stile.  One is a small slight person, in very good black\r\nclothes, not at all as if they were meant to ape a gentleman, and\r\ntherefore thoroughly respectable.  He has a thin face, rather pointed as\r\nto the chin and nose, and the eyes dark and keen, so that it would be\r\nover-sharp but that the mouth looks so gentle and subdued, and the whole\r\ncountenance is grave and thoughtful.  You could not feel half so sure\r\nthat he is a certificated school-master, as you can that his very brisk-\r\nlooking companion is so.\r\n\r\n\'Good morning, Mr. Brown.--Good morning, Paul,\' said Mr. Cope.  \'I did\r\nnot expect to see you arrive in this way.\'\r\n\r\nThe grave face glitters up in a merry look of amusement, while, with a\r\nlittle colouring, he answers:\r\n\r\n\'Why, Sir, Matilda said it was the proper thing, and so we supposed she\r\nknew best.\'\r\n\r\nThere are not so many people who _do_ talk of Paul now.  Most people know\r\nhim as Mr. Blackthorn, late school-master at Berryton, where the boys\r\nliked him for his bright and gentle yet very firm ways; the parents, for\r\ngetting their children on, and helping them to be steady; and the\r\nclergyman, for being so perfectly to be trusted, so anxious to do right,\r\nand, while efficient and well informed, perfectly humble and free from\r\nconceit.  Now he has just got an appointment to Hazleford school, in\r\nanother diocese, with a salary of fifty pounds a year; but, as Charles\r\nHayward would tell you, \'he hasn\'t got one bit of pride, no more than\r\nwhen he lived up in the hay-loft.\'\r\n\r\nThere is not long to wait.  There is another party getting over the\r\nstile.  There is a very fine tall youth first.  As Betsey Hardman tells\r\nher mother, \'she never saw such a one for being fine-growed and stately\r\nto look at, since poor Charles King when he wore his best wig.\'  A very\r\nnice open honest face, and as merry a pair of blue eyes as any in the\r\nparish, does Harold wear, nearly enough to tell you that, if in these six\r\nyears it would be too much to say he has never done _anything_ to vex his\r\nmother, yet in the main his heart is in the right place--he is a very\r\ngood son, very tender to her, and steady and right-minded.\r\n\r\nWhom is he helping over the stile?  Oh, that is Mrs. Mowbray\'s pretty\r\nlittle maid! a very good young thing, whom she has read with and taught;\r\nand here, lady-like and delicate-looking as ever, is Matilda.  Bridemaids\r\nbefore the bride! that\'s quite wrong; but the bride has a shy fit, and\r\nwould not get over first, and Matilda and Harold are, the one encouraging\r\nher, the other laughing at her; and Mr. Blackthorn turns very red, and\r\ngoes down the path to meet her, and she takes his arm, and Harold takes\r\nLucy, and Mr. Brown Miss King.\r\n\r\nVery nice that bride looks, with her hair so glossy under her straw\r\nbonnet trimmed with white, her pretty white shawl, and quiet purple silk\r\ndress, her face rather flushed, but quiet-looking, as if she were growing\r\nmore like her mother, with something of her sense and calmness.\r\n\r\nHow Mr. Blackthorn ever came to ask her that question, nobody can guess,\r\nand Harold believes he does not know himself.  However, it got an answer\r\ntwo years ago, and Mrs. King gave her consent with all her heart, though\r\nshe knew Betsey Hardman would talk of picking a husband up out of the\r\ngutter, and that my Lady would look severe, and say something of silly\r\ngirls.  Yes--and though the rich widower bailiff had said sundry civil\r\nthings of Miss Ellen being well brought up and notable--\'For,\' as Mrs.\r\nKing wrote to Matilda, \'I had rather see Ellen married to a good\r\nreligious man than to any one, and I do not know one I can be so sure of\r\nas Paul, nor one that is so like a son to me; and if he has no friends\r\nbelonging to him, that is better than bad friends.\'  And Ellen herself,\r\nfrom looking on him as a mere boy, as she had done at their first\r\nacquaintance, had come to thinking no one ever had been so wise or so\r\nclever, far less so good, certainly not so fond of her--so her answer was\r\nno great wonder.  Then they were to be prudent, and wait for some\r\ndependence; and so they did till Mr. Shaw recommended Paul Blackthorn for\r\nHazleford school, where there is a beautiful new house for the master, so\r\nthat he will have no longer to live in lodgings, and be \'done for,\' as\r\nthe saying is.  Harold tells Ellen that he is afraid that without her he\r\nwon\'t wash above once in four months; but however that may be, she is\r\nconvinced that the new school-house will be lost on him, and that in\r\nspite of all his fine arithmetic, his fifty pounds will never go so far\r\nfor one as for two; and so she did not turn a deaf ear to his entreaties\r\nthat she would not send him alone to Hazleford.\r\n\r\nThey wanted very much to get \'Mother\' to come and live with them, give up\r\nthe post-office, and let Harold live in Mr. Cope\'s house; but Mother has\r\na certain notion that Harold\'s stately looks and perfect health might not\r\nlast, if she were not always on the watch to put him into dry clothes if\r\nhe comes in damp, and such like \'little fidgets,\' as he calls them, which\r\nhe would not attend to from any one but Mother.  So she will keep on the\r\nshop and the post-office, and try to break in that uncouth girl of John\r\nFarden\'s to be a tidy little maid; and Mr. and Mrs. Blackthorn will spend\r\ntheir holidays with her and Harold.  She may come to them yet in time,\r\nif, as Paul predicts, Master Harold takes up with Lucy at the Grange--but\r\nthere\'s time enough to think of that; and even if he should, it would\r\ntake many years to make Lucy into such a Mrs. King as she who is now very\r\nbusy over the dinner at home, but thinking about a good deal besides the\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nThere!  Paul and Ellen have stood and knelt in an earnest reverent\r\nspirit, making their vows to one another and before God, and His blessing\r\nhas been spoken upon them to keep them all their lives through.\r\n\r\nIt is with a good heart of hope that Mr. Cope speaks that blessing,\r\nknowing that, as far as human eye can judge, here stands a man who truly\r\nfeareth the Lord, and beside him a woman with the ornament of a meek and\r\nquiet spirit.\r\n\r\nThey are leaving the church now, the bridegroom and his bride, arm in\r\narm, but they turn from the path to the wicket, and Harold will not let\r\neven Matilda follow them.  Just by the south wall of the church there are\r\nthree graves, one a very long one, one quite short, one of middle length.\r\nThe large one has a head-stone, with the names of Charles King, aged\r\nforty years, and Charles King, aged seven years.  The middle-sized one\r\nhas a stone cross, and below it \'Alfred King, aged sixteen years,\' and\r\nthe words, \'In all their afflictions He was afflicted.\'\r\n\r\nIt was Matilda who paid the cost of that stone, Miss Selby who drew the\r\npattern of it, and \'Mother\' who chose the words, as what Alfred himself\r\nloved best.  At the bottom of Ellen\'s best work-box is a copy of verses\r\nabout that very cross.  She thinks they ought to have been carved out\r\nupon it, but Paul knows a great deal better, so all she could do was to\r\nwrite them out on a sheet of note-paper with a wide lace border, and keep\r\nthem as her greatest treasure.  Perhaps she prizes them even more than\r\nthe handsome watch that Mr. Shaw gave Paul, though less, of course, than\r\nthe great Bible and Prayer-book, in which Mr. Cope has waited till this\r\nmorning to write the names of Paul and Ellen Blackthorn.\r\n\r\nSo they stand beside the cross, and read the words, and they neither of\r\nthem can say anything, though the white sweet face is before the eyes of\r\ntheir mind at the same time, and Ellen thinks she loves Paul twice as\r\nmuch for having been one of his great comforts.\r\n\r\n\'Good-bye, Alfred dear,\' she whispers at last.\r\n\r\n\'No, not good-bye,\' says Paul.  \'He is as much with us as ever, wherever\r\nwe are.  Remember how we were together, Ellen.  I have always thought of\r\nhim at every Holy Communion since, and have felt that if till now, no one\r\nliving--at least one at rest, were mine by right.\'\r\n\r\nEllen pressed his arm.\r\n\r\n\'Yes,\' said Paul; \'the months I spent with Alfred were the great help and\r\nblessing of my life.  I don\'t believe any recollection has so assisted to\r\nguard me in all the frets and temptations there are in a life like mine.\'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FRIARSWOOD POST-OFFICE***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 4296.txt or 4296.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/4/2/9/4296\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
