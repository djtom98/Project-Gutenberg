How otherwise should\r\nthere have been a Small House? Our story will, as its name imports,\r\nhave its closest relations with those who lived in the less dignified\r\ndomicile of the two; but it will have close relations also with\r\nthe more dignified, and it may be well that I should, in the first\r\ninstance, say a few words as to the Great House and its owner.\r\n\r\nThe squires of Allington had been squires of Allington since squires,\r\nsuch as squires are now, were first known in England. From father\r\nto son, and from uncle to nephew, and, in one instance, from second\r\ncousin to second cousin, the sceptre had descended in the family of\r\nthe Dales; and the acres had remained intact, growing in value and\r\nnot decreasing in number, though guarded by no entail and protected\r\nby no wonderful amount of prudence or wisdom. The estate of Dale of\r\nAllington had been coterminous with the parish of Allington for some\r\nhundreds of years; and though, as I have said, the race of squires\r\nhad possessed nothing of superhuman discretion, and had perhaps been\r\nguided in their walks through life by no very distinct principles,\r\nstill there had been with them so much of adherence to a sacred law,\r\nthat no acre of the property had ever been parted from the hands of\r\nthe existing squire. Some futile attempts had been made to increase\r\nthe territory, as indeed had been done by Kit Dale, the father of\r\nChristopher Dale, who will appear as our squire of Allington when the\r\npersons of our drama are introduced. Old Kit Dale, who had married\r\nmoney, had bought outlying farms,--a bit of ground here and a bit\r\nthere,--talking, as he did so, much of political influence and of\r\nthe good old Tory cause. But these farms and bits of ground had gone\r\nagain before our time. To them had been attached no religion. When\r\nold Kit had found himself pressed in that matter of the majority\r\nof the Nineteenth Dragoons, in which crack regiment his second son\r\nmade for himself quite a career, he found it easier to sell than\r\nto save--seeing that that which he sold was his own and not the\r\npatrimony of the Dales. At his death the remainder of these purchases\r\nhad gone. Family arrangements required completion, and Christopher\r\nDale required ready money. The outlying farms flew away, as such\r\nnew purchases had flown before; but the old patrimony of the Dales\r\nremained untouched, as it had ever remained.\r\n\r\nIt had been a religion among them; and seeing that the worship had\r\nbeen carried on without fail, that the vestal fire had never gone\r\ndown upon the hearth, I should not have said that the Dales had\r\nwalked their ways without high principle. To this religion they had\r\nall adhered, and the new heir had ever entered in upon his domain\r\nwithout other encumbrances than those with which he himself was then\r\nalready burdened. And yet there had been no entail. The idea of an\r\nentail was not in accordance with the peculiarities of the Dale mind.\r\nIt was necessary to the Dale religion that each squire should have\r\nthe power of wasting the acres of Allington,--and that he should\r\nabstain from wasting them. I remember to have dined at a house, the\r\nwhole glory and fortune of which depended on the safety of a glass\r\ngoblet. We all know the story. If the luck of Edenhall should be\r\nshattered, the doom of the family would be sealed. Nevertheless I was\r\nbidden to drink out of the fatal glass, as were all guests in that\r\nhouse. It would not have contented the chivalrous mind of the master\r\nto protect his doom by lock and key and padded chest. And so it was\r\nwith the Dales of Allington. To them an entail would have been a\r\nlock and key and a padded chest; but the old chivalry of their house\r\ndenied to them the use of such protection.\r\n\r\nI have spoken something slightingly of the acquirements and doings\r\nof the family; and indeed their acquirements had been few and their\r\ndoings little. At Allington, Dale of Allington had always been known\r\nas a king. At Guestwick, the neighbouring market town, he was a\r\ngreat man--to be seen frequently on Saturdays, standing in the\r\nmarket-place, and laying down the law as to barley and oxen among\r\nmen who knew usually more about barley and oxen than did he. At\r\nHamersham, the assize town, he was generally in some repute, being\r\na constant grand juror for the county, and a man who paid his way.\r\nBut even at Hamersham the glory of the Dales had, at most periods,\r\nbegun to pale, for they had seldom been widely conspicuous in the\r\ncounty, and had earned no great reputation by their knowledge of\r\njurisprudence in the grand jury room. Beyond Hamersham their fame had\r\nnot spread itself.\r\n\r\nThey had been men generally built in the same mould, inheriting each\r\nfrom his father the same virtues and the same vices,--men who would\r\nhave lived, each, as his father had lived before him, had not the new\r\nways of the world gradually drawn away with them, by an invisible\r\nmagnetism, the upcoming Dale of the day,--not indeed in any case\r\nso moving him as to bring him up to the spirit of the age in which\r\nhe lived, but dragging him forward to a line in advance of that on\r\nwhich his father had trodden. They had been obstinate men; believing\r\nmuch in themselves; just according to their ideas of justice; hard\r\nto their tenants--but not known to be hard even by the tenants\r\nthemselves, for the rules followed had ever been the rules on\r\nthe Allington estate; imperious to their wives and children, but\r\nimperious within bounds, so that no Mrs. Dale had fled from her\r\nlord\'s roof, and no loud scandals had existed between father and\r\nsons; exacting in their ideas as to money, expecting that they were\r\nto receive much and to give little, and yet not thought to be mean,\r\nfor they paid their way, and gave money in parish charity and in\r\ncounty charity. They had ever been steady supporters of the Church,\r\ngraciously receiving into their parish such new vicars as, from time\r\nto time, were sent to them from King\'s College, Cambridge, to which\r\nestablishment the gift of the living belonged;--but, nevertheless,\r\nthe Dales had ever carried on some unpronounced warfare against the\r\nclergyman, so that the intercourse between the lay family and the\r\nclerical had seldom been in all respects pleasant.\r\n\r\nSuch had been the Dales of Allington, time out of mind, and such in\r\nall respects would have been the Christopher Dale of our time, had he\r\nnot suffered two accidents in his youth. He had fallen in love with\r\na lady who obstinately refused his hand, and on her account he had\r\nremained single; that was his first accident. The second had fallen\r\nupon him with reference to his father\'s assumed wealth. He had\r\nsupposed himself to be richer than other Dales of Allington when\r\ncoming in upon his property, and had consequently entertained an\r\nidea of sitting in Parliament for his county. In order that he might\r\nattain this honour he had allowed himself to be talked by the men\r\nof Hamersham and Guestwick out of his old family politics, and had\r\ndeclared himself a Liberal. He had never gone to the poll, and,\r\nindeed, had never actually stood for the seat. But he had come\r\nforward as a liberal politician, and had failed; and, although it\r\nwas well known to all around that Christopher Dale was in heart as\r\nthoroughly conservative as any of his forefathers, this accident had\r\nmade him sour and silent on the subject of politics, and had somewhat\r\nestranged him from his brother squires.\r\n\r\nIn other respects our Christopher Dale was, if anything, superior to\r\nthe average of the family. Those whom he did love he loved dearly.\r\nThose whom he hated he did not ill-use beyond the limits of justice.\r\nHe was close in small matters of money, and yet in certain family\r\narrangements he was, as we shall see, capable of much liberality. He\r\nendeavoured to do his duty in accordance with his lights, and had\r\nsucceeded in weaning himself from personal indulgences, to which\r\nduring the early days of his high hopes he had become accustomed. And\r\nin that matter of his unrequited love he had been true throughout.\r\nIn his hard, dry, unpleasant way he had loved the woman; and when at\r\nlast he learned to know that she would not have his love, he had been\r\nunable to transfer his heart to another. This had happened just at\r\nthe period of his father\'s death, and he had endeavoured to console\r\nhimself with politics, with what fate we have already seen. A\r\nconstant, upright, and by no means insincere man was our Christopher\r\nDale,--thin and meagre in his mental attributes, by no means even\r\nunderstanding the fulness of a full man, with power of eye-sight very\r\nlimited in seeing aught which was above him, but yet worthy of regard\r\nin that he had realized a path of duty and did endeavour to walk\r\ntherein. And, moreover, our Mr. Christopher Dale was a gentleman.\r\n\r\nSuch in character was the squire of Allington, the only regular\r\ninhabitant of the Great House. In person, he was a plain, dry man,\r\nwith short grizzled hair and thick grizzled eyebrows. Of beard, he\r\nhad very little, carrying the smallest possible gray whiskers, which\r\nhardly fell below the points of his ears. His eyes were sharp and\r\nexpressive, and his nose was straight and well formed,--as was also\r\nhis chin. But the nobility of his face was destroyed by a mean mouth\r\nwith thin lips; and his forehead, which was high and narrow, though\r\nit forbad you to take Mr. Dale for a fool, forbad you also to take\r\nhim for a man of great parts, or of a wide capacity. In height, he\r\nwas about five feet ten; and at the time of our story was as near to\r\nseventy as he was to sixty. But years had treated him very lightly,\r\nand he bore few signs of age. Such in person was Christopher Dale,\r\nEsq., the squire of Allington, and owner of some three thousand a\r\nyear, all of which proceeded from the lands of that parish.\r\n\r\nAnd now I will speak of the Great House of Allington. After all, it\r\nwas not very great; nor was it surrounded by much of that exquisite\r\nnobility of park appurtenance which graces the habitations of most of\r\nour old landed proprietors. But the house itself was very graceful.\r\nIt had been built in the days of the early Stuarts, in that style of\r\narchitecture to which we give the name of the Tudors. On its front\r\nit showed three pointed roofs, or gables, as I believe they should\r\nbe called; and between each gable a thin tall chimney stood, the two\r\nchimneys thus raising themselves just above the three peaks I have\r\nmentioned. I think that the beauty of the house depended much on\r\nthose two chimneys; on them, and on the mullioned windows with which\r\nthe front of the house was closely filled. The door, with its jutting\r\nporch, was by no means in the centre of the house. As you entered,\r\nthere was but one window on your right hand, while on your left there\r\nwere three. And over these there was a line of five windows, one\r\ntaking its place above the porch. We all know the beautiful old\r\nTudor window, with its stout stone mullions and its stone transoms,\r\ncrossing from side to side at a point much nearer to the top than\r\nto the bottom. Of all windows ever invented it is the sweetest. And\r\nhere, at Allington, I think their beauty was enhanced by the fact\r\nthat they were not regular in their shape. Some of these windows were\r\nlong windows, while some of them were high. That to the right of the\r\ndoor, and that at the other extremity of the house, were among the\r\nformer. But the others had been put in without regard to uniformity,\r\na long window here, and a high window there, with a general effect\r\nwhich could hardly have been improved. Then above, in the three\r\ngables, were three other smaller apertures. But these also were\r\nmullioned, and the entire frontage of the house was uniform in its\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\nRound the house there were trim gardens, not very large, but worthy\r\nof much note in that they were so trim,--gardens with broad gravel\r\npaths, with one walk running in front of the house so broad as to\r\nbe fitly called a terrace. But this, though in front of the house,\r\nwas sufficiently removed from it to allow of a coach-road running\r\ninside it to the front door. The Dales of Allington had always been\r\ngardeners, and their garden was perhaps more noted in the county than\r\nany other of their properties. But outside the gardens no pretensions\r\nhad been made to the grandeur of a domain. The pastures round the\r\nhouse were but pretty fields, in which timber was abundant. There\r\nwas no deer-park at Allington; and though the Allington woods were\r\nwell known, they formed no portion of a whole of which the house was\r\na part. They lay away, out of sight, a full mile from the back of\r\nthe house; but not on that account of less avail for the fitting\r\npreservation of foxes.\r\n\r\nAnd the house stood much too near the road for purposes of grandeur,\r\nhad such purposes ever swelled the breast of any of the squires of\r\nAllington. But I fancy that our ideas of rural grandeur have altered\r\nsince many of our older country seats were built. To be near the\r\nvillage, so as in some way to afford comfort, protection, and\r\npatronage, and perhaps also with some view to the pleasantness of\r\nneighbourhood for its own inmates, seemed to be the object of a\r\ngentleman when building his house in the old days. A solitude in the\r\ncentre of a wide park is now the only site that can be recognized as\r\neligible. No cottage must be seen, unless the cottage orne of the\r\ngardener. The village, if it cannot be abolished, must be got out of\r\nsight. The sound of the church bells is not desirable, and the road\r\non which the profane vulgar travel by their own right must be at a\r\ndistance. When some old Dale of Allington built his house, he thought\r\ndifferently. There stood the church and there the village, and,\r\npleased with such vicinity, he sat himself down close to his God and\r\nto his tenants.\r\n\r\nAs you pass along the road from Guestwick into the village you see\r\nthe church near to you on your left hand; but the house is hidden\r\nfrom the road. As you approach the church, reaching the gate of it\r\nwhich is not above two hundred yards from the high road, you see the\r\nfull front of the Great House. Perhaps the best view of it is from\r\nthe churchyard. The lane leading up to the church ends in a gate,\r\nwhich is the entrance into Mr. Dale\'s place. There is no lodge there,\r\nand the gate generally stands open,--indeed, always does so, unless\r\nsome need of cattle grazing within requires that it should be closed.\r\nBut there is an inner gate, leading from the home paddock through\r\nthe gardens to the house, and another inner gate, some thirty yards\r\nfarther on, which will take you into the farm-yard. Perhaps it is a\r\ndefect at Allington that the farm-yard is very close to the house.\r\nBut the stables, and the straw-yards, and the unwashed carts, and the\r\nlazy lingering cattle of the homestead, are screened off by a row\r\nof chestnuts, which, when in its glory of flower, in the early days\r\nof May, no other row in England can surpass in beauty. Had any one\r\ntold Dale of Allington--this Dale or any former Dale--that his place\r\nwanted wood, he would have pointed with mingled pride and disdain to\r\nhis belt of chestnuts.\r\n\r\nOf the church itself I will say the fewest possible number of\r\nwords. It was a church such as there are, I think, thousands in\r\nEngland--low, incommodious, kept with difficulty in repair, too often\r\npervious to the wet, and yet strangely picturesque, and correct too,\r\naccording to great rules of architecture. It was built with a nave\r\nand aisles, visibly in the form of a cross, though with its arms\r\nclipped down to the trunk, with a separate chancel, with a large\r\nsquare short tower, and with a bell-shaped spire, covered with lead\r\nand irregular in its proportions. Who does not know the low porch,\r\nthe perpendicular Gothic window, the flat-roofed aisles, and the\r\nnoble old gray tower of such a church as this? As regards its\r\ninterior, it was dusty; it was blocked up with high-backed ugly pews;\r\nthe gallery in which the children sat at the end of the church, and\r\nin which two ancient musicians blew their bassoons, was all awry,\r\nand looked as though it would fall; the pulpit was an ugly useless\r\nedifice, as high nearly as the roof would allow, and the reading-desk\r\nunder it hardly permitted the parson to keep his head free from the\r\ndangling tassels of the cushion above him. A clerk also was there\r\nbeneath him, holding a third position somewhat elevated; and upon\r\nthe whole things there were not quite as I would have had them. But,\r\nnevertheless, the place looked like a church, and I can hardly say\r\nso much for all the modern edifices which have been built in my days\r\ntowards the glory of God. It looked like a church, and not the less\r\nso because in walking up the passage between the pews the visitor\r\ntrod upon the brass plates which dignified the resting-places of the\r\ndeparted Dales of old.\r\n\r\nBelow the church, and between that and the village, stood the\r\nvicarage, in such position that the small garden of the vicarage\r\nstretched from the churchyard down to the backs of the village\r\ncottages. This was a pleasant residence, newly built within the last\r\nthirty years, and creditable to the ideas of comfort entertained by\r\nthe rich collegiate body from which the vicars of Allington always\r\ncame. Doubtless we shall in the course of our sojourn at Allington\r\nvisit the vicarage now and then, but I do not know that any further\r\ndetailed account of its comforts will be necessary to us.\r\n\r\nPassing by the lane leading to the vicarage, the church and to the\r\nhouse, the high road descends rapidly to a little brook which runs\r\nthrough the village. On the right as you descend you will have seen\r\nthe "Red Lion," and will have seen no other house conspicuous in any\r\nway. At the bottom, close to the brook, is the post-office, kept\r\nsurely by the crossest old woman in all those parts. Here the road\r\npasses through the water, the accommodation of a narrow wooden bridge\r\nhaving been afforded for those on foot. But before passing the\r\nstream, you will see a cross street, running to the left, as had run\r\nthat other lane leading to the house. Here, as this cross street\r\nrises the hill, are the best houses in the village. The baker lives\r\nhere, and that respectable woman, Mrs. Frummage, who sells ribbons,\r\nand toys, and soap, and straw bonnets, with many other things too\r\nlong to mention. Here, too, lives an apothecary, whom the veneration\r\nof this and neighbouring parishes has raised to the dignity of a\r\ndoctor. And here also, in the smallest but prettiest cottage that can\r\nbe imagined, lives Mrs. Hearn, the widow of a former vicar, on terms,\r\nhowever, with her neighbour the squire which I regret to say are not\r\nas friendly as they should be. Beyond this lady\'s modest residence,\r\nAllington Street, for so the road is called, turns suddenly round\r\ntowards the church, and at the point of the turn is a pretty low iron\r\nrailing with a gate, and with a covered way, which leads up to the\r\nfront door of the house which stands there. I will only say here, at\r\nthis fag end of a chapter, that it is the Small House at Allington.\r\nAllington Street, as I have said, turns short round towards the\r\nchurch at this point, and there ends at a white gate, leading into\r\nthe churchyard by a second entrance.\r\n\r\nSo much it was needful that I should say of Allington Great House,\r\nof the Squire, and of the village. Of the Small House, I will speak\r\nseparately in a further chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE TWO PEARLS OF ALLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n"But Mr. Crosbie is only a mere clerk."\r\n\r\nThis sarcastic condemnation was spoken by Miss Lilian Dale to her\r\nsister Isabella, and referred to a gentleman with whom we shall have\r\nmuch concern in these pages. I do not say that Mr. Crosbie will be\r\nour hero, seeing that that part in the drama will be cut up, as it\r\nwere, into fragments. Whatever of the magnificent may be produced\r\nwill be diluted and apportioned out in very moderate quantities among\r\ntwo or more, probably among three or four, young gentlemen--to none\r\nof whom will be vouchsafed the privilege of much heroic action.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you call a mere clerk, Lily. Mr. Fanfaron is a\r\nmere barrister, and Mr. Boyce is a mere clergyman." Mr. Boyce was the\r\nvicar of Allington, and Mr. Fanfaron was a lawyer who had made his\r\nway over to Allington during the last assizes. "You might as well say\r\nthat Lord De Guest is a mere earl."\r\n\r\n"So he is--only a mere earl. Had he ever done anything except have\r\nfat oxen, one wouldn\'t say so. You know what I mean by a mere clerk?\r\nIt isn\'t much in a man to be in a public office, and yet Mr. Crosbie\r\ngives himself airs."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t suppose that Mr. Crosbie is the same as John Eames," said\r\nBell, who, by her tone of voice, did not seem inclined to undervalue\r\nthe qualifications of Mr. Crosbie. Now John Eames was a young\r\nman from Guestwick, who had been appointed to a clerkship in the\r\nIncome-tax Office, with eighty pounds a year, two years ago.\r\n\r\n"Then Johnny Eames is a mere clerk," said Lily; "and Mr. Crosbie\r\nis-- After all, Bell, what is Mr. Crosbie, if he is not a mere clerk?\r\nOf course, he is older than John Eames; and, as he has been longer at\r\nit, I suppose he has more than eighty pounds a year."\r\n\r\n"I am not in Mr. Crosbie\'s confidence. He is in the General Committee\r\nOffice, I know; and, I believe, has pretty nearly the management of\r\nthe whole of it. I have heard Bernard say that he has six or seven\r\nyoung men under him, and that--; but, of course, I don\'t know what he\r\ndoes at his office."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what he is, Bell; Mr. Crosbie is a swell." And Lilian\r\nDale was right; Mr. Crosbie was a swell.\r\n\r\nAnd here I may perhaps best explain who Bernard was, and who was\r\nMr. Crosbie. Captain Bernard Dale was an officer in the corps of\r\nEngineers, was the first cousin of the two girls who have been\r\nspeaking, and was nephew and heir presumptive to the squire. His\r\nfather, Colonel Dale, and his mother, Lady Fanny Dale, were still\r\nliving at Torquay--an effete, invalid, listless couple, pretty well\r\ndead to all the world beyond the region of the Torquay card-tables.\r\nHe it was who had made for himself quite a career in the Nineteenth\r\nDragoons. This he did by eloping with the penniless daughter of that\r\nimpoverished earl, the Lord De Guest. After the conclusion of that\r\nevent circumstances had not afforded him the opportunity of making\r\nhimself conspicuous; and he had gone on declining gradually in the\r\nworld\'s esteem--for the world had esteemed him when he first made\r\ngood his running with the Lady Fanny--till now, in his slippered\r\nyears, he and his Lady Fanny were unknown except among those Torquay\r\nBath chairs and card-tables. His elder brother was still a hearty\r\nman, walking in thick shoes, and constant in his saddle; but the\r\ncolonel, with nothing beyond his wife\'s title to keep his body awake,\r\nhad fallen asleep somewhat prematurely among his slippers. Of him and\r\nof Lady Fanny, Bernard Dale was the only son. Daughters they had had;\r\nsome were dead, some married, and one living with them among the\r\ncard-tables. Of his parents Bernard had latterly not seen much; not\r\nmore, that is, than duty and a due attention to the fifth commandment\r\nrequired of him. He also was making a career for himself, having\r\nobtained a commission in the Engineers, and being known to all his\r\ncompeers as the nephew of an earl, and as the heir to a property\r\nof three thousand a year. And when I say that Bernard Dale was not\r\ninclined to throw away any of these advantages, I by no means intend\r\nto speak in his dispraise. The advantage of being heir to a good\r\nproperty is so manifest--the advantages over and beyond those which\r\nare merely fiscal--that no man thinks of throwing them away, or\r\nexpects another man to do so. Moneys in possession or in expectation\r\ndo give a set to the head, and a confidence to the voice, and an\r\nassurance to the man, which will help him much in his walk in\r\nlife--if the owner of them will simply use them, and not abuse them.\r\nAnd for Bernard Dale I will say that he did not often talk of his\r\nuncle the earl. He was conscious that his uncle was an earl, and that\r\nother men knew the fact. He knew that he would not otherwise have\r\nbeen elected at the Beaufort, or at that most aristocratic of little\r\nclubs called Sebright\'s. When noble blood was called in question he\r\nnever alluded specially to his own, but he knew how to speak as one\r\nof whom all the world was aware on which side he had been placed by\r\nthe circumstances of his birth. Thus he used his advantage, and did\r\nnot abuse it. And in his profession he had been equally fortunate.\r\nBy industry, by a small but wakeful intelligence, and by some aid\r\nfrom patronage, he had got on till he had almost achieved the\r\nreputation of talent. His name had become known among scientific\r\nexperimentalists, not as that of one who had himself invented a\r\ncannon or an antidote to a cannon, but as of a man understanding\r\nin cannons and well fitted to look at those invented by others;\r\nwho would honestly test this or that antidote; or, if not honestly,\r\nseeing that such thin-minded men can hardly go to the proof of any\r\nmatter without some pre-judgment in their minds, at any rate with\r\nsuch appearance of honesty that the world might be satisfied. And in\r\nthis way Captain Dale was employed much at home, about London; and\r\nwas not called on to build barracks in Nova Scotia, or to make roads\r\nin the Punjaub.\r\n\r\nHe was a small slight man, smaller than his uncle, but in face very\r\nlike him. He had the same eyes, and nose, and chin, and the same\r\nmouth; but his forehead was better,--less high and pointed, and\r\nbetter formed about the brows. And then he wore moustaches, which\r\nsomewhat hid the thinness of his mouth. On the whole, he was not\r\nill-looking; and, as I have said before, he carried with him an air\r\nof self-assurance and a confident balance, which in itself gives a\r\ngrace to a young man.\r\n\r\nHe was staying at the present time in his uncle\'s house, during the\r\ndelicious warmth of the summer,--for, as yet, the month of July was\r\nnot all past; and his intimate friend, Adolphus Crosbie, who was\r\nor was not a mere clerk as my readers may choose to form their own\r\nopinions on that matter, was a guest in the house with him. I am\r\ninclined to say that Adolphus Crosbie was not a mere clerk; and I\r\ndo not think that he would have been so called, even by Lily Dale,\r\nhad he not given signs to her that he was a "swell." Now a man in\r\nbecoming a swell,--a swell of such an order as could possibly be\r\nknown to Lily Dale,--must have ceased to be a mere clerk in that very\r\nprocess. And, moreover, Captain Dale would not have been Damon to any\r\nPythias, of whom it might fairly be said that he was a mere clerk.\r\nNor could any mere clerk have got himself in either at the Beaufort\r\nor at Sebright\'s. The evidence against that former assertion made\r\nby Lily Dale is very strong; but then the evidence as to her latter\r\nassertion is as strong. Mr. Crosbie certainly was a swell. It is true\r\nthat he was a clerk in the General Committee Office. But then, in the\r\nfirst place, the General Committee Office is situated in Whitehall;\r\nwhereas poor John Eames was forced to travel daily from his lodgings\r\nin Burton Crescent, ever so far beyond Russell Square, to his dingy\r\nroom in Somerset House. And Adolphus Crosbie, when very young, had\r\nbeen a private secretary, and had afterwards mounted up in his office\r\nto some quasi authority and senior-clerkship, bringing him in seven\r\nhundred a year, and giving him a status among assistant secretaries\r\nand the like, which even in an official point of view was something.\r\nBut the triumphs of Adolphus Crosbie had been other than these. Not\r\nbecause he had been intimate with assistant secretaries, and was\r\nallowed in Whitehall a room to himself with an arm-chair, would he\r\nhave been entitled to stand upon the rug at Sebright\'s and speak\r\nwhile rich men listened,--rich men, and men also who had handles to\r\ntheir names! Adolphus Crosbie had done more than make minutes with\r\ndiscretion on the papers of the General Committee Office. He had set\r\nhimself down before the gates of the city of fashion, and had taken\r\nthem by storm; or, perhaps, to speak with more propriety, he had\r\npicked the locks and let himself in. In his walks of life he was\r\nsomebody in London. A man at the West End who did not know who was\r\nAdolphus Crosbie knew nothing. I do not say that he was the intimate\r\nfriend of many great men; but even great men acknowledged the\r\nacquaintance of Adolphus Crosbie, and he was to be seen in the\r\ndrawing-rooms, or at any rate on the staircases, of Cabinet\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\nLilian Dale, dear Lily Dale--for my reader must know that she is to\r\nbe very dear, and that my story will be nothing to him if he do not\r\nlove Lily Dale--Lilian Dale had discovered that Mr. Crosbie was a\r\nswell. But I am bound to say that Mr. Crosbie did not habitually\r\nproclaim the fact in any offensive manner; nor in becoming a swell\r\nhad he become altogether a bad fellow. It was not to be expected\r\nthat a man who was petted at Sebright\'s should carry himself in the\r\nAllington drawing-room as would Johnny Eames, who had never been\r\npetted by any one but his mother. And this fraction of a hero of ours\r\nhad other advantages to back him, over and beyond those which fashion\r\nhad given him. He was a tall, well-looking man, with pleasant eyes\r\nand an expressive mouth,--a man whom you would probably observe in\r\nwhatever room you might meet him. And he knew how to talk, and had\r\nin him something which justified talking. He was no butterfly or\r\ndandy, who flew about in the world\'s sun, warmed into prettiness\r\nby a sunbeam. Crosbie had his opinion on things,--on politics, on\r\nreligion, on the philanthropic tendencies of the age, and had read\r\nsomething here and there as he formed his opinion. Perhaps he might\r\nhave done better in the world had he not been placed so early in life\r\nin that Whitehall public office. There was that in him which might\r\nhave earned better bread for him in an open profession.\r\n\r\nBut in that matter of his bread the fate of Adolphus Crosbie had by\r\nthis time been decided for him, and he had reconciled himself to fate\r\nthat was now inexorable. Some very slight patrimony, a hundred a year\r\nor so, had fallen to his share. Beyond that he had his salary from\r\nhis office, and nothing else; and on his income, thus made up, he had\r\nlived as a bachelor in London, enjoying all that London could give\r\nhim as a man in moderately easy circumstances, and looking forward to\r\nno costly luxuries,--such as a wife, a house of his own, or a stable\r\nfull of horses. Those which he did enjoy of the good things of the\r\nworld would, if known to John Eames, have made him appear fabulously\r\nrich in the eyes of that brother clerk. His lodgings in Mount Street\r\nwere elegant in their belongings. During three months of the season\r\nin London he called himself the master of a very neat hack. He was\r\nalways well dressed, though never over-dressed. At his clubs he could\r\nlive on equal terms with men having ten times his income. He was\r\nnot married. He had acknowledged to himself that he could not marry\r\nwithout money; and he would not marry for money. He had put aside\r\nfrom him, as not within his reach, the comforts of marriage. But-- We\r\nwill not, however, at the present moment inquire more curiously\r\ninto the private life and circumstances of our new friend Adolphus\r\nCrosbie.\r\n\r\nAfter the sentence pronounced against him by Lilian, the two girls\r\nremained silent for awhile. Bell was, perhaps, a little angry with\r\nher sister. It was not often that she allowed herself to say much\r\nin praise of any gentleman; and, now that she had spoken a word or\r\ntwo in favour of Mr. Crosbie, she felt herself to be rebuked by her\r\nsister for this unwonted enthusiasm. Lily was at work on a drawing,\r\nand in a minute or two had forgotten all about Mr. Crosbie; but the\r\ninjury remained on Bell\'s mind, and prompted her to go back to the\r\nsubject. "I don\'t like those slang words, Lily."\r\n\r\n"What slang words?"\r\n\r\n"You know what you called Bernard\'s friend."\r\n\r\n"Oh; a swell. I fancy I do like slang. I think it\'s awfully jolly to\r\ntalk about things being jolly. Only that I was afraid of your nerves\r\nI should have called him stunning. It\'s so slow, you know, to use\r\nnothing but words out of a dictionary."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it\'s nice in talking of gentlemen."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it? Well, I\'d like to be nice--if I knew how."\r\n\r\nIf she knew how! There is no knowing how, for a girl, in that matter.\r\nIf nature and her mother have not done it for her, there is no hope\r\nfor her on that head. I think I may say that nature and her mother\r\nhad been sufficiently efficacious for Lilian Dale in this respect.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Crosbie is, at any rate, a gentleman, and knows how to make\r\nhimself pleasant. That was all that I meant. Mamma said a great deal\r\nmore about him than I did."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Crosbie is an Apollo; and I always look upon Apollo as the\r\ngreatest--you know what--that ever lived. I mustn\'t say the word,\r\nbecause Apollo was a gentleman."\r\n\r\nAt this moment, while the name of the god was still on her lips,\r\nthe high open window of the drawing-room was darkened, and Bernard\r\nentered, followed by Mr. Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"Who is talking about Apollo?" said Captain Dale.\r\n\r\nThe girls were both stricken dumb. How would it be with them if Mr.\r\nCrosbie had heard himself spoken of in those last words of poor\r\nLily\'s? This was the rashness of which Bell was ever accusing her\r\nsister, and here was the result! But, in truth, Bernard had heard\r\nnothing more than the name, and Mr. Crosbie, who had been behind him,\r\nhad heard nothing.\r\n\r\n"\'As sweet and musical as bright Apollo\'s lute, strung with his\r\nhair,\'" said Mr. Crosbie, not meaning much by the quotation, but\r\nperceiving that the two girls had been in some way put out and\r\nsilenced.\r\n\r\n"What very bad music it must have made," said Lily; "unless, indeed,\r\nhis hair was very different from ours."\r\n\r\n"It was all sunbeams," suggested Bernard. But by that time Apollo had\r\nserved his turn, and the ladies welcomed their guests in the proper\r\nform.\r\n\r\n"Mamma is in the garden," said Bell, with that hypocritical pretence\r\nso common with young ladies when young gentlemen call; as though they\r\nwere aware that mamma was the object specially sought.\r\n\r\n"Picking peas, with a sun-bonnet on," said Lily.\r\n\r\n"Let us by all means go and help her," said Mr. Crosbie; and then\r\nthey issued out into the garden.\r\n\r\nThe gardens of the Great House of Allington and those of the Small\r\nHouse open on to each other. A proper boundary of thick laurel hedge,\r\nand wide ditch, and of iron spikes guarding the ditch, there is\r\nbetween them; but over the wide ditch there is a foot-bridge, and at\r\nthe bridge there is a gate which has no key; and for all purposes of\r\nenjoyment the gardens of each house are open to the other. And the\r\ngardens of the Small House are very pretty. The Small House itself\r\nis so near the road that there is nothing between the dining-room\r\nwindows and the iron rail but a narrow edge rather than border, and\r\na little path made with round fixed cobble stones, not above two\r\nfeet broad, into which no one but the gardener ever makes his way.\r\nThe distance from the road to the house is not above five or six\r\nfeet, and the entrance from the gate is shut in by a covered way.\r\nBut the garden behind the house, on to which the windows from the\r\ndrawing-room open, is to all the senses as private as though there\r\nwere no village of Allington, and no road up to the church within a\r\nhundred yards of the lawn. The steeple of the church, indeed, can be\r\nseen from the lawn, peering, as it were, between the yew-trees which\r\nstand in the corner of the churchyard adjoining to Mrs. Dale\'s wall.\r\nBut none of the Dale family have any objection to the sight of that\r\nsteeple. The glory of the Small House at Allington certainly consists\r\nin its lawn, which is as smooth, as level, and as much like velvet as\r\ngrass has ever yet been made to look. Lily Dale, taking pride in her\r\nown lawn, has declared often that it is no good attempting to play\r\ncroquet up at the Great House. The grass, she says, grows in tufts,\r\nand nothing that Hopkins, the gardener, can or will do has any effect\r\nupon the tufts. But there are no tufts at the Small House. As the\r\nsquire himself has never been very enthusiastic about croquet, the\r\ncroquet implements have been moved permanently down to the Small\r\nHouse, and croquet there has become quite an institution.\r\n\r\nAnd while I am on the subject of the garden I may also mention Mrs.\r\nDale\'s conservatory, as to which Bell was strenuously of opinion that\r\nthe Great House had nothing to offer equal to it--"For flowers, of\r\ncourse, I mean," she would say, correcting herself; for at the Great\r\nHouse there was a grapery very celebrated. On this matter the squire\r\nwould be less tolerant than as regarded the croquet, and would tell\r\nhis niece that she knew nothing about flowers. "Perhaps not, uncle\r\nChristopher," she would say. "All the same, I like our geraniums\r\nbest;" for there was a spice of obstinacy about Miss Dale,--as,\r\nindeed, there was in all the Dales, male and female, young and old.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to explain that the care of this lawn and of this\r\nconservatory, and, indeed, of the entire garden belonging to the\r\nSmall House, was in the hands of Hopkins, the head gardener to the\r\nGreat House; and it was so simply for this reason, that Mrs. Dale\r\ncould not afford to keep a gardener herself. A working lad, at ten\r\nshillings a week, who cleaned the knives and shoes, and dug the\r\nground, was the only male attendant on the three ladies. But Hopkins,\r\nthe head gardener of Allington, who had men under him, was as widely\r\nawake to the lawn and the conservatory of the humbler establishment\r\nas he was to the grapery, peach-walls, and terraces of the grander\r\none. In his eyes it was all one place. The Small House belonged to\r\nhis master, as indeed did the very furniture within it; and it was\r\nlent, not let, to Mrs. Dale. Hopkins, perhaps, did not love Mrs.\r\nDale, seeing that he owed her no duty as one born a Dale. The two\r\nyoung ladies he did love, and also snubbed in a very peremptory way\r\nsometimes. To Mrs. Dale he was coldly civil, always referring to the\r\nsquire if any direction worthy of special notice as concerning the\r\ngarden was given to him.\r\n\r\nAll this will serve to explain the terms on which Mrs. Dale was\r\nliving at the Small House,--a matter needful of explanation sooner or\r\nlater. Her husband had been the youngest of three brothers, and in\r\nmany respects the brightest. Early in life he had gone up to London,\r\nand there had done well as a land surveyor. He had done so well that\r\nGovernment had employed him, and for some three or four years he had\r\nenjoyed a large income, but death had come suddenly on him, while he\r\nwas only yet ascending the ladder; and, when he died, he had hardly\r\nbegun to realize the golden prospects which he had seen before him.\r\nThis had happened some fifteen years before our story commenced, so\r\nthat the two girls hardly retained any memory of their father. For\r\nthe first five years of her widowhood, Mrs. Dale, who had never been\r\na favourite of the squire\'s, lived with her two little girls in\r\nsuch modest way as her very limited means allowed. Old Mrs. Dale,\r\nthe squire\'s mother, then occupied the Small House. But when old\r\nMrs. Dale died, the squire offered the place rent-free to his\r\nsister-in-law, intimating to her that her daughters would obtain\r\nconsiderable social advantages by living at Allington. She had\r\naccepted the offer, and the social advantages had certainly followed.\r\nMrs. Dale was poor, her whole income not exceeding three hundred a\r\nyear, and therefore her own style of living was of necessity very\r\nunassuming; but she saw her girls becoming popular in the county,\r\nmuch liked by the families around them, and enjoying nearly all\r\nthe advantages which would have accrued to them had they been the\r\ndaughters of Squire Dale of Allington. Under such circumstances it\r\nwas little to her whether or no she were loved by her brother-in-law,\r\nor respected by Hopkins. Her own girls loved her, and respected her,\r\nand that was pretty much all that she demanded of the world on her\r\nown behalf.\r\n\r\nAnd uncle Christopher had been very good to the girls in his own\r\nobstinate and somewhat ungracious manner. There were two ponies in\r\nthe stables of the Great House, which they were allowed to ride, and\r\nwhich, unless on occasions, nobody else did ride. I think he might\r\nhave given the ponies to the girls, but he thought differently. And\r\nhe contributed to their dresses, sending them home now and again\r\nthings which he thought necessary, not in the pleasantest way in the\r\nworld. Money he never gave them, nor did he make them any promises.\r\nBut they were Dales, and he loved them; and with Christopher Dale to\r\nlove once was to love always. Bell was his chief favourite, sharing\r\nwith his nephew Bernard the best warmth of his heart. About these\r\ntwo he had his projects, intending that Bell should be the future\r\nmistress of the Great House of Allington; as to which project,\r\nhowever, Miss Dale was as yet in very absolute ignorance.\r\n\r\nWe may now, I think, go back to our four friends, as they walked out\r\nupon the lawn. They were understood to be on a mission to assist Mrs.\r\nDale in the picking of the peas; but pleasure intervened in the way\r\nof business, and the young people, forgetting the labours of their\r\nelder, allowed themselves to be carried away by the fascinations of\r\ncroquet. The iron hoops and the sticks were fixed. The mallets and\r\nthe balls were lying about; and then the party was so nicely made up!\r\n"I haven\'t had a game of croquet yet," said Mr. Crosbie. It cannot\r\nbe said that he had lost much time, seeing that he had only arrived\r\nbefore dinner on the preceding day. And then the mallets were in\r\ntheir hands in a moment.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll play sides, of course," said Lily. "Bernard and I\'ll play\r\ntogether." But this was not allowed. Lily was well known to be the\r\nqueen of the croquet ground; and as Bernard was supposed to be more\r\nefficient than his friend, Lily had to take Mr. Crosbie as her\r\npartner. "Apollo can\'t get through the hoops," Lily said afterwards\r\nto her sister; "but then how gracefully he fails to do it!" Lily,\r\nhowever, had been beaten, and may therefore be excused for a little\r\nspite against her partner. But it so turned out that before Mr.\r\nCrosbie took his final departure from Allington he could get through\r\nthe hoops; and Lily, though she was still queen of the croquet\r\nground, had to acknowledge a male sovereign in that dominion.\r\n\r\n"That\'s not the way we played at--," said Crosbie, at one point of\r\nthe game, and then stopped himself.\r\n\r\n"Where was that?" said Bernard.\r\n\r\n"A place I was at last summer,--in Shropshire."\r\n\r\n"Then they don\'t play the game, Mr. Crosbie, at the place you were at\r\nlast summer,--in Shropshire," said Lily.\r\n\r\n"You mean Lady Hartletop\'s," said Bernard. Now, the Marchioness\r\nof Hartletop was a very great person indeed, and a leader in the\r\nfashionable world.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Lady Hartletop\'s!" said Lily. "Then I suppose we must give in;"\r\nwhich little bit of sarcasm was not lost upon Mr. Crosbie, and was\r\nput down by him in the tablets of his mind as quite undeserved.\r\nHe had endeavoured to avoid any mention of Lady Hartletop and her\r\ncroquet ground, and her ladyship\'s name had been forced upon him.\r\nNevertheless, he liked Lily Dale through it all. But he thought that\r\nhe liked Bell the best, though she said little; for Bell was the\r\nbeauty of the family.\r\n\r\nDuring the game Bernard remembered that they had especially come over\r\nto bid the three ladies to dinner at the house on that day. They had\r\nall dined there on the day before, and the girls\' uncle had now sent\r\ndirections to them to come again. "I\'ll go and ask mamma about it,"\r\nsaid Bell, who was out first. And then she returned, saying, that she\r\nand her sister would obey their uncle\'s behest; but that her mother\r\nwould prefer to remain at home. "There are the peas to be eaten, you\r\nknow," said Lily.\r\n\r\n"Send them up to the Great House," said Bernard.\r\n\r\n"Hopkins would not allow it," said Lily. "He calls that a mixing of\r\nthings. Hopkins doesn\'t like mixings." And then when the game was\r\nover, they sauntered about, out of the small garden into the larger\r\none, and through the shrubberies, and out upon the fields, where they\r\nfound the still lingering remnants of the haymaking. And Lily took a\r\nrake, and raked for two minutes; and Mr. Crosbie, making an attempt\r\nto pitch the hay into the cart, had to pay half-a-crown for his\r\nfooting to the haymakers; and Bell sat quiet under a tree, mindful\r\nof her complexion; whereupon Mr. Crosbie, finding the hay-pitching\r\nnot much to his taste, threw himself under the same tree also, quite\r\nafter the manner of Apollo, as Lily said to her mother late in the\r\nevening. Then Bernard covered Lily with hay, which was a great feat\r\nin the jocose way for him; and Lily in returning the compliment,\r\nalmost smothered Mr. Crosbie,--by accident.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lily," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I beg your pardon, Mr. Crosbie. It was Bernard\'s fault.\r\nBernard, I never will come into a hayfield with you again." And so\r\nthey all became very intimate; while Bell sat quietly under the tree,\r\nlistening to a word or two now and then as Mr. Crosbie chose to speak\r\nthem. There is a kind of enjoyment to be had in society, in which\r\nvery few words are necessary. Bell was less vivacious than her sister\r\nLily; and when, an hour after this, she was dressing herself for\r\ndinner, she acknowledged that she had passed a pleasant afternoon,\r\nthough Mr. Crosbie had not said very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE WIDOW DALE OF ALLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Dale, of the Small House, was not a Dale by birth, there\r\ncan be no necessity for insisting on the fact that none of the\r\nDale peculiarities should be sought for in her character. These\r\npeculiarities were not, perhaps, very conspicuous in her daughters,\r\nwho had taken more in that respect from their mother than from their\r\nfather; but a close observer might recognize the girls as Dales. They\r\nwere constant, perhaps obstinate, occasionally a little uncharitable\r\nin their judgment, and prone to think that there was a great deal\r\nin being a Dale, though not prone to say much about it. But they\r\nhad also a better pride than this, which had come to them as their\r\nmother\'s heritage.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale was certainly a proud woman,--not that there was anything\r\nappertaining to herself in which she took a pride. In birth she had\r\nbeen much lower than her husband, seeing that her grandfather had\r\nbeen almost nobody. Her fortune had been considerable for her rank\r\nin life, and on its proceeds she now mainly depended; but it had not\r\nbeen sufficient to give any of the pride of wealth. And she had been\r\na beauty; according to my taste, was still very lovely; but certainly\r\nat this time of life, she, a widow of fifteen years\' standing, with\r\ntwo grown-up daughters, took no pride in her beauty. Nor had she\r\nany conscious pride in the fact that she was a lady. That she was a\r\nlady, inwards and outwards, from the crown of her head to the sole\r\nof her feet, in head, in heart, and in mind, a lady by education and\r\na lady by nature, a lady also by birth in spite of that deficiency\r\nrespecting her grandfather, I hereby state as a fact--meo periculo.\r\nAnd the squire, though he had no special love for her, had recognized\r\nthis, and in all respects treated her as his equal.\r\n\r\nBut her position was one which required that she should either be\r\nvery proud or else very humble. She was poor, and yet her daughters\r\nmoved in a position which belongs, as a rule, to the daughters of\r\nrich men only. This they did as nieces of the childless squire of\r\nAllington, and as his nieces she felt that they were entitled to\r\naccept his countenance and kindness, without loss of self-respect\r\neither to her or to them. She would have ill done her duty as a\r\nmother to them had she allowed any pride of her own to come between\r\nthem and such advantage in the world as their uncle might be able to\r\ngive them. On their behalf she had accepted the loan of the house in\r\nwhich she lived, and the use of many of the appurtenances belonging\r\nto her brother-in-law; but on her own account she had accepted\r\nnothing. Her marriage with Philip Dale had been disliked by his\r\nbrother the squire, and the squire, while Philip was still living,\r\nhad continued to show that his feelings in this respect were not\r\nto be overcome. They never had been overcome; and now, though the\r\nbrother-in-law and sister-in-law had been close neighbours for years,\r\nliving as one may say almost in the same family, they had never\r\nbecome friends. There had not been a word of quarrel between them.\r\nThey met constantly. The squire had unconsciously come to entertain a\r\nprofound respect for his brother\'s widow. The widow had acknowledged\r\nto herself the truth of the affection shown by the uncle to her\r\ndaughters. But yet they had never come together as friends. Of her\r\nown money matters Mrs. Dale had never spoken a word to the squire.\r\nOf his intention respecting the girls the squire had never spoken a\r\nword to the mother. And in this way they had lived and were living at\r\nAllington.\r\n\r\nThe life which Mrs. Dale led was not altogether an easy life,--was\r\nnot devoid of much painful effort on her part. The theory of her life\r\none may say was this--that she should bury herself in order that\r\nher daughters might live well above ground. And in order to carry\r\nout this theory, it was necessary that she should abstain from all\r\ncomplaint or show of uneasiness before her girls. Their life above\r\nground would not be well if they understood that their mother, in\r\nthis underground life of hers, was enduring any sacrifice on their\r\nbehalf. It was needful that they should think that the picking of\r\npeas in a sun-bonnet, or long readings by her own fire-side, and\r\nsolitary hours spent in thinking, were specially to her mind. "Mamma\r\ndoesn\'t like going out." "I don\'t think mamma is happy anywhere out\r\nof her own drawing-room." I do not say that the girls were taught to\r\nsay such words, but they were taught to have thoughts which led to\r\nsuch words, and in the early days of their going out into the world\r\nused so to speak of their mother. But a time came to them before\r\nlong,--to one first and then to the other, in which they knew that\r\nit was not so, and knew also all that their mother had suffered for\r\ntheir sakes.\r\n\r\nAnd in truth Mrs. Dale could have been as young in heart as they\r\nwere. She, too, could have played croquet, and have coquetted with\r\na haymaker\'s rake, and have delighted in her pony, ay, and have\r\nlistened to little nothings from this and that Apollo, had she\r\nthought that things had been conformable thereto. Women at forty do\r\nnot become ancient misanthropes, or stern Rhadamanthine moralists,\r\nindifferent to the world\'s pleasures--no, not even though they be\r\nwidows. There are those who think that such should be the phase of\r\ntheir minds. I profess that I do not so think. I would have women,\r\nand men also, young as long as they can be young. It is not that a\r\nwoman should call herself in years younger than her father\'s family\r\nBible will have her to be. Let her who is forty call herself forty;\r\nbut if she can be young in spirit at forty, let her show that she is\r\nso.\r\n\r\nI think that Mrs. Dale was wrong. She would have joined that party on\r\nthe croquet ground, instead of remaining among the pea-sticks in her\r\nsun-bonnet, had she done as I would have counselled her. Not a word\r\nwas spoken among the four that she did not hear. Those pea-sticks\r\nwere only removed from the lawn by a low wall and a few shrubs. She\r\nlistened, not as one suspecting, but simply as one loving. The voices\r\nof her girls were very dear to her, and the silver ringing tones of\r\nLily\'s tongue were as sweet to her ears as the music of the gods. She\r\nheard all that about Lady Hartletop, and shuddered at Lily\'s bold\r\nsarcasm. And she heard Lily say that mamma would stay at home and\r\neat the peas, and said to herself sadly that that was now her lot in\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n"Dear darling girl,--and so it should be!"\r\n\r\nIt was thus her thoughts ran. And then, when her ear had traced them,\r\nas they passed across the little bridge into the other grounds, she\r\nreturned across the lawn to the house with her burden on her arm,\r\nand sat herself down on the step of the drawing-room window, looking\r\nout on the sweet summer flowers and the smooth surface of the grass\r\nbefore her.\r\n\r\nHad not God done well for her to place her where she was? Had not her\r\nlines been set for her in pleasant places? Was she not happy in her\r\ngirls,--her sweet, loving, trusting, trusty children? As it was to be\r\nthat her lord, that best half of herself, was to be taken from her in\r\nearly life, and that the springs of all the lighter pleasures were to\r\nbe thus stopped for her, had it not been well that in her bereavement\r\nso much had been done to soften her lot in life and give it grace and\r\nbeauty? \'Twas so, she argued with herself, and yet she acknowledged\r\nto herself that she was not happy. She had resolved, as she herself\r\nhad said often, to put away childish things, and now she pined for\r\nthose things which she so put from her. As she sat she could still\r\nhear Lily\'s voice as they went through the shrubbery,--hear it when\r\nnone but a mother\'s ears would have distinguished the sound. Now\r\nthat those young men were at the Great House it was natural that her\r\ngirls should be there too. The squire would not have had young men to\r\nstay with him had there been no ladies to grace his table. But for\r\nher,--she knew that no one would want her there. Now and again she\r\nmust go, as otherwise her very existence, without going, would be a\r\nthing disagreeably noticeable. But there was no other reason why she\r\nshould join the party; nor in joining it would she either give or\r\nreceive pleasure. Let her daughters eat from her brother\'s table and\r\ndrink of his cup. They were made welcome to do so from the heart. For\r\nher there was no such welcome as that at the Great House,--nor at any\r\nother house, or any other table!\r\n\r\n"Mamma will stay at home to eat the peas."\r\n\r\nAnd then she repeated to herself the words which Lily had spoken,\r\nsitting there, leaning with her elbow on her knee, and her head upon\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n"Please, ma\'am, cook says, can we have the peas to shell?" and then\r\nher reverie was broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: "Please, ma\'am, can we have the peas to shell?"]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereupon Mrs. Dale got up and gave over her basket. "Cook knows that\r\nthe young ladies are going to dine at the Great House?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"She needn\'t mind getting dinner for me. I will have tea early." And\r\nso, after all, Mrs. Dale did not perform that special duty appointed\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\nBut she soon set herself to work upon another duty. When a family\r\nof three persons has to live upon an income of three hundred a year,\r\nand, nevertheless, makes some pretence of going into society, it has\r\nto be very mindful of small details, even though that family may\r\nconsist only of ladies. Of this Mrs. Dale was well aware, and as\r\nit pleased her that her daughters should be nice and fresh, and\r\npretty in their attire, many a long hour was given up to that care.\r\nThe squire would send them shawls in winter, and had given them\r\nriding habits, and had sent them down brown silk for dresses from\r\nLondon,--so limited in quantity that the due manufacture of two\r\ndresses out of the material had been found to be beyond the art of\r\nwoman, and the brown silk garments had been a difficulty from that\r\nday to this,--the squire having a good memory in such matters, and\r\nbeing anxious to see the fruits of his liberality. All this was\r\ndoubtless of assistance, but had the squire given the amount which\r\nhe so expended in money to his nieces, the benefit would have been\r\ngreater. As it was, the girls were always nice and fresh and pretty,\r\nthey themselves not being idle in that matter; but their tire-woman\r\nin chief was their mother. And now she went up to their room and got\r\nout their muslin frocks, and--but, perhaps, I should not tell such\r\ntales!--She, however, felt no shame in her work, as she sent for a\r\nhot iron, and with her own hands smoothed out the creases, and gave\r\nthe proper set to the crimp flounces, and fixed a new ribbon where\r\nit was wanted, and saw that all was as it should be. Men think but\r\nlittle how much of this kind is endured that their eyes may be\r\npleased, even though it be but for an hour.\r\n\r\n"Oh! mamma, how good you are," said Bell, as the two girls came in,\r\nonly just in time to make themselves ready for returning to dinner.\r\n\r\n"Mamma is always good," said Lily. "I wish, mamma, I could do the\r\nsame for you oftener," and then she kissed her mother. But the squire\r\nwas exact about dinner, so they dressed themselves in haste, and went\r\noff again through the garden, their mother accompanying them to the\r\nlittle bridge.\r\n\r\n"Your uncle did not seem vexed at my not coming?" said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"We have not seen him, mamma," said Lily. "We have been ever so far\r\ndown the fields, and forgot altogether what o\'clock it was."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think uncle Christopher was about the place, or we should\r\nhave met him," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"But I am vexed with you, mamma. Are not you, Bell? It is very bad of\r\nyou to stay here all alone, and not come."\r\n\r\n"I suppose mamma likes being at home better than up at the Great\r\nHouse," said Bell, very gently; and as she spoke she was holding her\r\nmother\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"Well; good-by, dears. I shall expect you between ten and eleven. But\r\ndon\'t hurry yourselves if anything is going on." And so they went,\r\nand the widow was again alone. The path from the bridge ran straight\r\nup towards the back of the Great House, so that for a moment or two\r\nshe could see them as they tripped on almost in a run. And then she\r\nsaw their dresses flutter as they turned sharp round, up the terrace\r\nsteps. She would not go beyond the nook among the laurels by which\r\nshe was surrounded, lest any one should see her as she looked after\r\nher girls. But when the last flutter of the pink muslin had been\r\nwhisked away from her sight, she felt it hard that she might not\r\nfollow them. She stood there, however, without advancing a step. She\r\nwould not have Hopkins telling how she watched her daughters as they\r\nwent from her own home to that of her brother-in-law. It was not\r\nwithin the capacity of Hopkins to understand why she watched them.\r\n\r\n"Well, girls, you\'re not much too soon. I think your mother might\r\nhave come with you," said uncle Christopher. And this was the manner\r\nof the man. Had he known his own wishes he must have acknowledged to\r\nhimself that he was better pleased that Mrs. Dale should stay away.\r\nHe felt himself more absolutely master and more comfortably at\r\nhome at his own table without her company than with it. And yet he\r\nfrequently made a grievance of her not coming, and himself believed\r\nin that grievance.\r\n\r\n"I think mamma was tired," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"Hem. It\'s not so very far across from one house to the other. If I\r\nwere to shut myself up whenever I\'m tired-- But never mind. Let\'s\r\ngo to dinner. Mr. Crosbie, will you take my niece Lilian." And then,\r\noffering his own arm to Bell, he walked off to the dining-room.\r\n\r\n"If he scolds mamma any more, I\'ll go away," said Lily to her\r\ncompanion; by which it may be seen that they had all become very\r\nintimate during the long day that they had passed together.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale, after remaining for a moment on the bridge, went in to her\r\ntea. What succedaneum of mutton chop or broiled ham she had for the\r\nroast duck and green peas which were to have been provided for the\r\nfamily dinner we will not particularly inquire. We may, however,\r\nimagine that she did not devote herself to her evening repast with\r\nany peculiar energy of appetite. She took a book with her as she sat\r\nherself down,--some novel, probably, for Mrs. Dale was not above\r\nnovels,--and read a page or two as she sipped her tea. But the book\r\nwas soon laid on one side, and the tray on which the warm plate had\r\nbecome cold was neglected, and she threw herself back in her own\r\nfamiliar chair, thinking of herself, and of her girls, and thinking\r\nalso what might have been her lot in life had he lived who had loved\r\nher truly during the few years that they had been together.\r\n\r\nIt is especially the nature of a Dale to be constant in his likings\r\nand his dislikings. Her husband\'s affection for her had been\r\nunswerving,--so much so that he had quarrelled with his brother\r\nbecause his brother would not express himself in brotherly terms\r\nabout his wife; but, nevertheless, the two brothers had loved each\r\nother always. Many years had now gone by since these things had\r\noccurred, but still the same feelings remained. When she had first\r\ncome down to Allington she had resolved to win the squire\'s regard,\r\nbut she had now long known that any such winning was out of the\r\nquestion; indeed, there was no longer a wish for it. Mrs. Dale was\r\nnot one of those soft-hearted women who sometimes thank God that\r\nthey can love any one. She could once have felt affection for her\r\nbrother-in-law,--affection, and close, careful, sisterly friendship;\r\nbut she could not do so now. He had been cold to her, and had with\r\nperseverance rejected her advances. That was now seven years since;\r\nand during those years Mrs. Dale had been, at any rate, as cold to\r\nhim as he had been to her.\r\n\r\nBut all this was very hard to bear. That her daughters should love\r\ntheir uncle was not only reasonable, but in every way desirable. He\r\nwas not cold to them. To them he was generous and affectionate. If\r\nshe were only out of the way, he would have taken them to his house\r\nas his own, and they would in all respects have stood before the\r\nworld as his adopted children. Would it not be better if she were out\r\nof the way?\r\n\r\nIt was only in her most dismal moods that this question would get\r\nitself asked within her mind, and then she would recover herself, and\r\nanswer it stoutly with an indignant protest against her own morbid\r\nweakness. It would not be well that she should be away from her\r\ngirls,--not though their uncle should have been twice a better uncle;\r\nnot though, by her absence, they might become heiresses of all\r\nAllington. Was it not above everything to them that they should\r\nhave a mother near them? And as she asked of herself that morbid\r\nquestion,--wickedly asked it, as she declared to herself,--did she\r\nnot know that they loved her better than all the world beside, and\r\nwould prefer her caresses and her care to the guardianship of any\r\nuncle, let his house be ever so great? As yet they loved her better\r\nthan all the world beside. Of other love, should it come, she would\r\nnot be jealous. And if it should come, and should be happy, might\r\nthere not yet be a bright evening of life for herself? If they should\r\nmarry, and if their lords would accept her love, her friendship, and\r\nher homage, she might yet escape from the deathlike coldness of that\r\nGreat House, and be happy in some tiny cottage, from which she might\r\ngo forth at times among those who would really welcome her. A certain\r\ndoctor there was, living not very far from Allington, at Guestwick,\r\nas to whom she had once thought that he might fill that place of\r\nson-in-law,--to be well-beloved. Her quiet, beautiful Bell had seemed\r\nto like the man; and he had certainly done more than seem to like\r\nher. But now, for some weeks past, this hope, or rather this idea,\r\nhad faded away. Mrs. Dale had never questioned her daughter on the\r\nmatter; she was not a woman prone to put such questions. But during\r\nthe month or two last past, she had seen with regret that Bell looked\r\nalmost coldly on the man whom her mother favoured.\r\n\r\nIn thinking of all this the long evening passed away, and at eleven\r\no\'clock she heard the coming steps across the garden. The young men\r\nhad, of course, accompanied the girls home; and as she stepped out\r\nfrom the still open window of her own drawing-room, she saw them all\r\non the centre of the lawn before her.\r\n\r\n"There\'s mamma," said Lily. "Mamma, Mr. Crosbie wants to play croquet\r\nby moonlight."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think there is light enough for that," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"There is light enough for him," said Lily, "for he plays quite\r\nindependently of the hoops; don\'t you, Mr. Crosbie?"\r\n\r\n"There\'s very pretty croquet light, I should say," said Mr. Crosbie,\r\nlooking up at the bright moon; "and then it is so stupid going to\r\nbed."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is stupid going to bed," said Lily; "but people in the\r\ncountry are stupid, you know. Billiards, that you can play all night\r\nby gas, is much better, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Your arrows fall terribly astray there, Miss Dale, for I never touch\r\na cue; you should talk to your cousin about billiards."\r\n\r\n"Is Bernard a great billiard player?" asked Bell.\r\n\r\n"Well, I do play now and again; about as well as Crosbie does\r\ncroquet. Come, Crosbie, we\'ll go home and smoke a cigar."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lily; "and then, you know, we stupid people can go to\r\nbed. Mamma, I wish you had a little smoking-room here for us. I don\'t\r\nlike being considered stupid." And then they parted,--the ladies\r\ngoing into the house, and the two men returning across the lawn.\r\n\r\n"Lily, my love," said Mrs. Dale, when they were all together in her\r\nbedroom, "it seems to me that you are very hard upon Mr. Crosbie."\r\n\r\n"She has been going on like that all the evening," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure we are very good friends," said Lily.\r\n\r\n"Oh, very!" said Bell.\r\n\r\n"Now, Bell, you\'re jealous; you know you are." And then, seeing that\r\nher sister was in some slight degree vexed, she went up to her and\r\nkissed her. "She shan\'t be called jealous; shall she, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she deserves it," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"Now, you don\'t mean to say that you think I meant anything," said\r\nLily. "As if I cared a buttercup about Mr. Crosbie."\r\n\r\n"Or I either, Lily."\r\n\r\n"Of course you don\'t. But I do care for him very much, mamma. He is\r\nsuch a duck of an Apollo. I shall always call him Apollo; Phoebus\r\nApollo! And when I draw his picture he shall have a mallet in his\r\nhand instead of a bow. Upon my word I am very much obliged to Bernard\r\nfor bringing him down here; and I do wish he was not going away the\r\nday after to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"The day after to-morrow!" said Mrs. Dale. "It was hardly worth\r\ncoming for two days."\r\n\r\n"No, it wasn\'t,--disturbing us all in our quiet little ways just for\r\nsuch a spell as that,--not giving one time even to count his rays."\r\n\r\n"But he says he shall perhaps come again," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"There is that hope for us," said Lily. "Uncle Christopher asked him\r\nto come down when he gets his long leave of absence. This is only a\r\nshort sort of leave. He is better off than poor Johnny Eames. Johnny\r\nEames only has a month, but Mr. Crosbie has two months just whenever\r\nhe likes it; and seems to be pretty much his own master all the year\r\nround besides."\r\n\r\n"And uncle Christopher asked him to come down for the shooting in\r\nSeptember," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"And though he didn\'t say he\'d come I think he meant it," said Lily.\r\n"There is that hope for us, mamma."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ll have to draw Apollo with a gun instead of a mallet."\r\n\r\n"That is the worst of it, mamma. We shan\'t see much of him or of\r\nBernard either. They wouldn\'t let us go out into the woods as\r\nbeaters, would they?"\r\n\r\n"You\'d make too much noise to be of any use."\r\n\r\n"Should I? I thought the beaters had to shout at the birds. I should\r\nget very tired of shouting at birds, so I think I\'ll stay at home and\r\nlook after my clothes."\r\n\r\n"I hope he will come, because uncle Christopher seems to like him so\r\nmuch," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"I wonder whether a certain gentleman at Guestwick will like his\r\ncoming," said Lily. And then, as soon as she had spoken the words,\r\nshe looked at her sister, and saw that she had grieved her.\r\n\r\n"Lily, you let your tongue run too fast," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean anything, Bell," said Lily. "I beg your pardon."\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t signify," said Bell. "Only Lily says things without\r\nthinking." And then that conversation came to an end, and nothing\r\nmore was said among them beyond what appertained to their toilet,\r\nand a few last words at parting. But the two girls occupied the same\r\nroom, and when their own door was closed upon them, Bell did allude\r\nto what had passed with some spirit.\r\n\r\n"Lily, you promised me," she said, "that you would not say anything\r\nmore to me about Dr. Crofts."\r\n\r\n"I know I did, and I was very wrong. I beg your pardon, Bell; and I\r\nwon\'t do it again,--not if I can help it."\r\n\r\n"Not help it, Lily!"\r\n\r\n"But I\'m sure I don\'t know why I shouldn\'t speak of him,--only not in\r\nthe way of laughing at you. Of all the men I ever saw in my life I\r\nlike him best. And only that I love you better than I love myself I\r\ncould find it in my heart to grudge you his--"\r\n\r\n"Lily, what did you promise just now?"\r\n\r\n"Well; after to-night. And I don\'t know why you should turn against\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"I have never turned against him or for him."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no turning about him. He\'d give his left hand if you\'d only\r\nsmile on him. Or his right either,--and that\'s what I should like to\r\nsee; so now you\'ve heard it."\r\n\r\n"You know you are talking nonsense."\r\n\r\n"So I should like to see it. And so would mamma too, I\'m sure; though\r\nI never heard her say a word about him. In my mind he\'s the finest\r\nfellow I ever saw. What\'s Mr. Apollo Crosbie to him? And now, as it\r\nmakes you unhappy, I\'ll never say another word about him."\r\n\r\nAs Bell wished her sister good-night with perhaps more than her usual\r\naffection, it was evident that Lily\'s words and eager tone had in\r\nsome way pleased her, in spite of their opposition to the request\r\nwhich she had made. And Lily was aware that it was so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMRS. ROPER\'S BOARDING-HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: (untitled)]\r\n\r\nI have said that John Eames had been petted by none but his mother,\r\nbut I would not have it supposed, on this account, that John Eames\r\nhad no friends. There is a class of young men who never get petted,\r\nthough they may not be the less esteemed, or perhaps loved. They do\r\nnot come forth to the world as Apollos, nor shine at all, keeping\r\nwhat light they may have for inward purposes. Such young men are\r\noften awkward, ungainly, and not yet formed in their gait; they\r\nstraggle with their limbs, and are shy; words do not come to them\r\nwith ease, when words are required, among any but their accustomed\r\nassociates. Social meetings are periods of penance to them, and any\r\nappearance in public will unnerve them. They go much about alone,\r\nand blush when women speak to them. In truth, they are not as yet\r\nmen, whatever the number may be of their years; and, as they are no\r\nlonger boys, the world has found for them the ungraceful name of\r\nhobbledehoy.\r\n\r\nSuch observations, however, as I have been enabled to make on this\r\nmatter have led me to believe that the hobbledehoy is by no means\r\nthe least valuable species of the human race. When I compare the\r\nhobbledehoy of one or two and twenty to some finished Apollo of\r\nthe same age, I regard the former as unripe fruit, and the latter\r\nas fruit that is ripe. Then comes the question as to the two fruits.\r\nWhich is the better fruit, that which ripens early--which is,\r\nperhaps, favoured with some little forcing apparatus, or which, at\r\nleast, is backed by the warmth of a southern wall; or that fruit of\r\nslower growth, as to which nature works without assistance, on which\r\nthe sun operates in its own time,--or perhaps never operates if some\r\nungenial shade has been allowed to interpose itself? The world, no\r\ndoubt, is in favour of the forcing apparatus or of the southern wall.\r\nThe fruit comes certainly, and at an assured period. It is spotless,\r\nspeckless, and of a certain quality by no means despicable. The owner\r\nhas it when he wants it, and it serves its turn. But, nevertheless,\r\naccording to my thinking, the fullest flavour of the sun is given\r\nto that other fruit,--is given in the sun\'s own good time, if so be\r\nthat no ungenial shade has interposed itself. I like the smack of the\r\nnatural growth, and like it, perhaps, the better because that which\r\nhas been obtained has been obtained without favour.\r\n\r\nBut the hobbledehoy, though he blushes when women address him, and\r\nis uneasy even when he is near them, though he is not master of his\r\nlimbs in a ball-room, and is hardly master of his tongue at any\r\ntime, is the most eloquent of beings, and especially eloquent among\r\nbeautiful women. He enjoys all the triumphs of a Don Juan, without\r\nany of Don Juan\'s heartlessness, and is able to conquer in all\r\nencounters, through the force of his wit and the sweetness of his\r\nvoice. But this eloquence is heard only by his own inner ears, and\r\nthese triumphs are the triumphs of his imagination.\r\n\r\nThe true hobbledehoy is much alone, not being greatly given to social\r\nintercourse even with other hobbledehoys--a trait in his character\r\nwhich I think has hardly been sufficiently observed by the world at\r\nlarge. He has probably become a hobbledehoy instead of an Apollo,\r\nbecause circumstances have not afforded him much social intercourse;\r\nand, therefore, he wanders about in solitude, taking long walks, in\r\nwhich he dreams of those successes which are so far removed from his\r\npowers of achievement. Out in the fields, with his stick in his hand,\r\nhe is very eloquent, cutting off the heads of the springing summer\r\nweeds, as he practises his oratory with energy. And thus he feeds an\r\nimagination for which those who know him give him but scanty credit,\r\nand unconsciously prepares himself for that latter ripening, if only\r\nthe ungenial shade will some day cease to interpose itself.\r\n\r\nSuch hobbledehoys receive but little petting, unless it be from a\r\nmother; and such a hobbledehoy was John Eames when he was sent away\r\nfrom Guestwick to begin his life in the big room of a public office\r\nin London. We may say that there was nothing of the young Apollo\r\nabout him. But yet he was not without friends--friends who wished him\r\nwell, and thought much of his welfare. And he had a younger sister\r\nwho loved him dearly, who had no idea that he was a hobbledehoy,\r\nbeing somewhat of a hobbledehoya herself. Mrs. Eames, their mother,\r\nwas a widow, living in a small house in Guestwick, whose husband had\r\nbeen throughout his whole life an intimate friend of our squire. He\r\nhad been a man of many misfortunes, having begun the world almost\r\nwith affluence, and having ended it in poverty. He had lived all his\r\ndays in Guestwick, having at one time occupied a large tract of land,\r\nand lost much money in experimental farming; and late in life he had\r\ntaken a small house on the outskirts of the town, and there had died,\r\nsome two years previously to the commencement of this story. With\r\nno other man had Mr. Dale lived on terms so intimate; and when Mr.\r\nEames died Mr. Dale acted as executor under his will, and as guardian\r\nto his children. He had, moreover, obtained for John Eames that\r\nsituation under the Crown which he now held.\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Eames had been and still was on very friendly terms with\r\nMrs. Dale. The squire had never taken quite kindly to Mrs. Eames,\r\nwhom her husband had not met till he was already past forty years\r\nof age. But Mrs. Dale had made up by her kindness to the poor\r\nforlorn woman for any lack of that cordiality which might have been\r\nshown to her from the Great House. Mrs. Eames was a poor forlorn\r\nwoman--forlorn even during the time of her husband\'s life, but very\r\nwobegone now in her widowhood. In matters of importance the squire\r\nhad been kind to her; arranging for her her little money affairs,\r\nadvising her about her house and income, also getting for her that\r\nappointment for her son. But he snubbed her when he met her, and poor\r\nMrs. Eames held him in great awe. Mrs. Dale held her brother-in-law\r\nin no awe, and sometimes gave to the widow from Guestwick advice\r\nquite at variance to that given by the squire. In this way there\r\nhad grown up an intimacy between Bell and Lily and the young Eames,\r\nand either of the girls was prepared to declare that Johnny Eames\r\nwas her own and well-loved friend. Nevertheless, they spoke of him\r\noccasionally with some little dash of merriment--as is not unusual\r\nwith pretty girls who have hobbledehoys among their intimate friends,\r\nand who are not themselves unaccustomed to the grace of an Apollo.\r\n\r\nI may as well announce at once that John Eames, when he went up to\r\nLondon, was absolutely and irretrievably in love with Lily Dale. He\r\nhad declared his passion in the most moving language a hundred times;\r\nbut he had declared it only to himself. He had written much poetry\r\nabout Lily, but he kept his lines safe under double lock and key.\r\nWhen he gave the reins to his imagination, he flattered himself that\r\nhe might win not only her but the world at large also by his verses;\r\nbut he would have perished rather than exhibit them to human eye.\r\nDuring the last ten weeks of his life at Guestwick, while he was\r\npreparing for his career in London, he hung about Allington, walking\r\nover frequently and then walking back again; but all in vain. During\r\nthese visits he would sit in Mrs. Dale\'s drawing-room, speaking but\r\nlittle, and addressing himself usually to the mother; but on each\r\noccasion, as he started on his long, hot walk, he resolved that he\r\nwould say something by which Lily might know of his love. When he\r\nleft for London that something had not been said.\r\n\r\nHe had not dreamed of asking her to be his wife. John Eames was about\r\nto begin the world with eighty pounds a year, and an allowance of\r\ntwenty more from his mother\'s purse. He was well aware that with such\r\nan income he could not establish himself as a married man in London,\r\nand he also felt that the man who might be fortunate enough to win\r\nLily for his wife should be prepared to give her every soft luxury\r\nthat the world could afford. He knew well that he ought not to expect\r\nany assurance of Lily\'s love; but, nevertheless, he thought it\r\npossible that he might give her an assurance of his love. It would\r\nprobably be in vain. He had no real hope, unless when he was in\r\none of those poetic moods. He had acknowledged to himself, in some\r\nindistinct way, that he was no more than a hobbledehoy, awkward,\r\nsilent, ungainly, with a face unfinished, as it were, or unripe. All\r\nthis he knew, and knew also that there were Apollos in the world who\r\nwould be only too ready to carry off Lily in their splendid cars. But\r\nnot the less did he make up his mind that having loved her once, it\r\nbehoved him, as a true man, to love her on to the end.\r\n\r\nOne little word he had said to her when they parted, but it had been\r\na word of friendship rather than of love. He had strayed out after\r\nher on to the lawn, leaving Bell alone in the drawing-room. Perhaps\r\nLily had understood something of the boy\'s feeling, and had wished\r\nto speak kindly to him at parting, or almost more than kindly. There\r\nis a silent love which women recognize, and which in some silent way\r\nthey acknowledge,--giving gracious but silent thanks for the respect\r\nwhich accompanies it.\r\n\r\n"I have come to say good-by, Lily," said Johnny Eames, following the\r\ngirl down one of the paths.\r\n\r\n"Good-by, John," said she, turning round. "You know how sorry we are\r\nto lose you. But it\'s a great thing for you to be going up to\r\nLondon."\r\n\r\n"Well; yes. I suppose it is. I\'d sooner remain here, though."\r\n\r\n"What! stay here, doing nothing! I am sure you would not."\r\n\r\n"Of course, I should like to do something. I mean--"\r\n\r\n"You mean that it is painful to part with old friends; and I\'m sure\r\nthat we all feel that at parting with you. But you\'ll have a holiday\r\nsometimes, and then we shall see you."\r\n\r\n"Yes; of course, I shall see you then. I think, Lily, I shall care\r\nmore about seeing you than anybody."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, John. There\'ll be your own mother and sister."\r\n\r\n"Yes; there\'ll be mother and Mary, of course. But I will come over\r\nhere the very first day,--that is, if you\'ll care to see me?"\r\n\r\n"We shall care to see you very much. You know that. And--dear John,\r\nI do hope you\'ll be happy."\r\n\r\nThere was a tone in her voice as she spoke which almost upset him;\r\nor, I should rather say, which almost put him up upon his legs and\r\nmade him speak; but its ultimate effect was less powerful. "Do you?"\r\nsaid he, as he held her hand for a few happy seconds. "And I\'m sure\r\nI hope you\'ll always be happy. Good-by, Lily." Then he left her,\r\nreturning to the house, and she continued her walk, wandering down\r\namong the trees in the shrubbery, and not showing herself for the\r\nnext half hour. How many girls have some such lover as that,--a lover\r\nwho says no more to them than Johnny Eames then said to Lily Dale,\r\nwho never says more than that? And yet when, in after years, they\r\ncount over the names of all who have loved them, the name of that\r\nawkward youth is never forgotten.\r\n\r\nThat farewell had been spoken nearly two years since, and Lily Dale\r\nwas then seventeen. Since that time, John Eames had been home once,\r\nand during his month\'s holiday had often visited Allington. But he\r\nhad never improved upon that occasion of which I have told. It had\r\nseemed to him that Lily was colder to him than in old days, and he\r\nhad become, if anything, more shy in his ways with her. He was to\r\nreturn to Guestwick again during this autumn; but, to tell honestly\r\nthe truth in the matter, Lily Dale did not think or care very\r\nmuch for his coming. Girls of nineteen do not care for lovers of\r\none-and-twenty, unless it be when the fruit has had the advantage of\r\nsome forcing apparatus or southern wall.\r\n\r\nJohn Eames\'s love was still as hot as ever, having been sustained on\r\npoetry, and kept alive, perhaps, by some close confidence in the ears\r\nof a brother clerk; but it is not to be supposed that during these\r\ntwo years he had been a melancholy lover. It might, perhaps, have\r\nbeen better for him had his disposition led him to that line of life.\r\nSuch, however, had not been the case. He had already abandoned the\r\nflute on which he had learned to sound three sad notes before he left\r\nGuestwick, and, after the fifth or sixth Sunday, he had relinquished\r\nhis solitary walks along the towing-path of the Regent\'s Park\r\nCanal. To think of one\'s absent love is very sweet; but it becomes\r\nmonotonous after a mile or two of a towing-path, and the mind\r\nwill turn away to Aunt Sally, the Cremorne Gardens, and financial\r\nquestions. I doubt whether any girl would be satisfied with her\r\nlover\'s mind if she knew the whole of it.\r\n\r\n"I say, Caudle, I wonder whether a fellow could get into a club?"\r\n\r\nThis proposition was made, on one of those Sunday walks, by John\r\nEames to the friend of his bosom, a brother clerk, whose legitimate\r\nname was Cradell, and who was therefore called Caudle by his friends.\r\n\r\n"Get into a club? Fisher in our room belongs to a club."\r\n\r\n"That\'s only a chess-club. I mean a regular club."\r\n\r\n"One of the swell ones at the West End?" said Cradell, almost lost in\r\nadmiration at the ambition of his friend.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t want it to be particularly swell. If a man isn\'t a\r\nswell, I don\'t see what he gets by going among those who are. But\r\nit is so uncommon slow at Mother Roper\'s." Now Mrs. Roper was a\r\nrespectable lady, who kept a boarding-house in Burton Crescent,\r\nand to whom Mrs. Eames had been strongly recommended when she was\r\ndesirous of finding a specially safe domicile for her son. For the\r\nfirst year of his life in London John Eames had lived alone in\r\nlodgings; but that had resulted in discomfort, solitude, and, alas!\r\nin some amount of debt, which had come heavily on the poor widow.\r\nNow, for the second year, some safer mode of life was necessary. She\r\nhad learned that Mrs. Cradell, the widow of a barrister, who had also\r\nsucceeded in getting her son into the Income-tax Office, had placed\r\nhim in charge of Mrs. Roper; and she, with many injunctions to that\r\nmotherly woman, submitted her own boy to the same custody.\r\n\r\n"And about going to church?" Mrs. Eames had said to Mrs. Roper.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose I can look after that, ma\'am," Mrs. Roper had\r\nanswered, conscientiously. "Young gentlemen choose mostly their own\r\nchurches."\r\n\r\n"But they do go?" asked the mother, very anxious in her heart as to\r\nthis new life in which her boy was to be left to follow in so many\r\nthings the guidance of his own lights.\r\n\r\n"They who have been brought up steady do so, mostly."\r\n\r\n"He has been brought up steady, Mrs. Roper. He has, indeed. And you\r\nwon\'t give him a latch-key?"\r\n\r\n"Well, they always do ask for it."\r\n\r\n"But he won\'t insist, if you tell him that I had rather that he\r\nshouldn\'t have one."\r\n\r\nMrs. Roper promised accordingly, and Johnny Eames was left under her\r\ncharge. He did ask for the latch-key, and Mrs. Roper answered as she\r\nwas bidden. But he asked again, having been sophisticated by the\r\nphilosophy of Cradell, and then Mrs. Roper handed him the key. She\r\nwas a woman who plumed herself on being as good as her word, not\r\nunderstanding that any one could justly demand from her more than\r\nthat. She gave Johnny Eames the key, as doubtless she had intended\r\nto do; for Mrs. Roper knew the world, and understood that young men\r\nwithout latch-keys would not remain with her.\r\n\r\n"I thought you didn\'t seem to find it so dull since Amelia came\r\nhome," said Cradell.\r\n\r\n"Amelia! What\'s Amelia to me? I have told you everything, Cradell,\r\nand yet you can talk to me about Amelia Roper!"\r\n\r\n"Come now, Johnny--" He had always been called Johnny, and the name\r\nhad gone with him to his office. Even Amelia Roper had called him\r\nJohnny on more than one occasion before this. "You were as sweet to\r\nher the other night as though there were no such person as L. D. in\r\nexistence." John Eames turned away and shook his head. Nevertheless,\r\nthe words of his friend were grateful to him. The character of a Don\r\nJuan was not unpleasant to his imagination, and he liked to think\r\nthat he might amuse Amelia Roper with a passing word, though his\r\nheart was true to Lilian Dale. In truth, however, many more of the\r\npassing words had been spoken by the fair Amelia than by him.\r\n\r\nMrs. Roper had been quite as good as her word when she told Mrs.\r\nEames that her household was composed of herself, of a son who was in\r\nan attorney\'s office, of an ancient maiden cousin, named Miss Spruce,\r\nwho lodged with her, and of Mr. Cradell. The divine Amelia had not\r\nthen been living with her, and the nature of the statement which she\r\nwas making by no means compelled her to inform Mrs. Eames that the\r\nyoung lady would probably return home in the following winter. A Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Lupex had also joined the family lately, and Mrs. Roper\'s\r\nhouse was now supposed to be full.\r\n\r\nAnd it must be acknowledged that Johnny Eames had, in certain\r\nunguarded moments, confided to Cradell the secret of a second weaker\r\npassion for Amelia. "She is a fine girl,--a deuced fine girl!" Johnny\r\nEames had said, using a style of language which he had learned since\r\nhe left Guestwick and Allington. Mr. Cradell, also, was an admirer\r\nof the fair sex; and, alas! that I should say so, Mrs. Lupex, at\r\nthe present moment, was the object of his admiration. Not that he\r\nentertained the slightest idea of wronging Mr. Lupex,--a man who was\r\na scene-painter, and knew the world. Mr. Cradell admired Mrs. Lupex\r\nas a connoisseur, not simply as a man. "By heavens! Johnny, what a\r\nfigure that woman has!" he said, one morning, as they were walking to\r\ntheir office.\r\n\r\n"Yes; she stands well on her pins."\r\n\r\n"I should think she did. If I understand anything of form," said\r\nCradell, "that woman is nearly perfect. What a torso she has!"\r\n\r\nFrom which expression, and from the fact that Mrs. Lupex depended\r\ngreatly upon her stays and crinoline for such figure as she succeeded\r\nin displaying, it may, perhaps, be understood that Mr. Cradell did\r\nnot understand much about form.\r\n\r\n"It seems to me that her nose isn\'t quite straight," said Johnny\r\nEames. Now, it undoubtedly was the fact that the nose on Mrs. Lupex\'s\r\nface was a little awry. It was a long, thin nose, which, as it\r\nprogressed forward into the air, certainly had a preponderating bias\r\ntowards the left side.\r\n\r\n"I care more for figure than face," said Cradell. "But Mrs. Lupex has\r\nfine eyes--very fine eyes."\r\n\r\n"And knows how to use them, too," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t she? And then she has lovely hair."\r\n\r\n"Only she never brushes it in the morning."\r\n\r\n"Do you know, I like that kind of deshabille," said Cradell. "Too\r\nmuch care always betrays itself."\r\n\r\n"But a woman should be tidy."\r\n\r\n"What a word to apply to such a creature as Mrs. Lupex! I call her\r\na splendid woman. And how well she was got up last night. Do you\r\nknow, I\'ve an idea that Lupex treats her very badly. She said a word\r\nor two to me yesterday that--," and then he paused. There are some\r\nconfidences which a man does not share even with his dearest friend.\r\n\r\n"I rather fancy it\'s quite the other way," said Eames.\r\n\r\n"How the other way?"\r\n\r\n"That Lupex has quite as much as he likes of Mrs. L. The sound of her\r\nvoice sometimes makes me shake in my shoes, I know."\r\n\r\n"I like a woman with spirit," said Cradell.\r\n\r\n"Oh, so do I. But one may have too much of a good thing. Amelia did\r\ntell me;--only you won\'t mention it."\r\n\r\n"Of course, I won\'t."\r\n\r\n"She told me that Lupex sometimes was obliged to run away from her.\r\nHe goes down to the theatre, and remains there two or three days at a\r\ntime. Then she goes to fetch him, and there is no end of a row in the\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"The fact is, he drinks," said Cradell. "By George, I pity a woman\r\nwhose husband drinks--and such a woman as that, too!"\r\n\r\n"Take care, old fellow, or you\'ll find yourself in a scrape."\r\n\r\n"I know what I\'m at. Lord bless you, I\'m not going to lose my head\r\nbecause I see a fine woman."\r\n\r\n"Or your heart either?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, heart! There\'s nothing of that kind of thing about me. I regard\r\na woman as a picture or a statue. I dare say I shall marry some day,\r\nbecause men do; but I\'ve no idea of losing myself about a woman."\r\n\r\n"I\'d lose myself ten times over for--"\r\n\r\n"L. D.," said Cradell.\r\n\r\n"That I would. And yet I know I shall never have her. I\'m a jolly,\r\nlaughing sort of fellow; and yet, do you know, Caudle, when that girl\r\nmarries, it will be all up with me. It will, indeed."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that you\'ll cut your throat?"\r\n\r\n"No; I shan\'t do that. I shan\'t do anything of that sort; and yet it\r\nwill be all up with me."\r\n\r\n"You are going down there in October;--why don\'t you ask her to have\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"With ninety pounds a year!" His grateful country had twice increased\r\nhis salary at the rate of five pounds each year. "With ninety pounds\r\na year, and twenty allowed me by my mother!"\r\n\r\n"She could wait, I suppose. I should ask her, and no mistake. If one\r\nis to love a girl, it\'s no good one going on in that way!"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t much good, certainly," said Johnny Eames. And then they\r\nreached the door of the Income-tax Office, and each went away to his\r\nown desk.\r\n\r\nFrom this little dialogue, it may be imagined that though Mrs. Roper\r\nwas as good as her word, she was not exactly the woman whom Mrs.\r\nEames would have wished to select as a protecting angel for her son.\r\nBut the truth I take to be this, that protecting angels for widows\'\r\nsons, at forty-eight pounds a year, paid quarterly, are not to be\r\nfound very readily in London. Mrs. Roper was not worse than others of\r\nher class. She would much have preferred lodgers who were respectable\r\nto those who were not so,--if she could only have found respectable\r\nlodgers as she wanted them. Mr. and Mrs. Lupex hardly came under that\r\ndenomination; and when she gave them up her big front bedroom at a\r\nhundred a year, she knew she was doing wrong. And she was troubled,\r\ntoo, about her own daughter Amelia, who was already over thirty years\r\nof age. Amelia was a very clever young woman, who had been, if the\r\ntruth must be told, first young lady at a millinery establishment in\r\nManchester. Mrs. Roper knew that Mrs. Eames and Mrs. Cradell would\r\nnot wish their sons to associate with her daughter. But what could\r\nshe do? She could not refuse the shelter of her own house to her own\r\nchild, and yet her heart misgave her when she saw Amelia flirting\r\nwith young Eames.\r\n\r\n"I wish, Amelia, you wouldn\'t have so much to say to that young man."\r\n\r\n"Laws, mother."\r\n\r\n"So I do. If you go on like that, you\'ll put me out of both my\r\nlodgers."\r\n\r\n"Go on like what, mother? If a gentleman speaks to me, I suppose I\'m\r\nto answer him? I know how to behave myself, I believe." And then she\r\ngave her head a toss. Whereupon her mother was silent; for her mother\r\nwas afraid of her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nABOUT L. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nApollo Crosbie left London for Allington on the 31st of August,\r\nintending to stay there four weeks, with the declared intention of\r\nrecruiting his strength by an absence of two months from official\r\ncares, and with no fixed purpose as to his destiny for the last of\r\nthose two months. Offers of hospitality had been made to him by the\r\ndozen. Lady Hartletop\'s doors, in Shropshire, were open to him, if he\r\nchose to enter them. He had been invited by the Countess De Courcy to\r\njoin her suite at Courcy Castle. His special friend Montgomerie Dobbs\r\nhad a place in Scotland, and then there was a yachting party by which\r\nhe was much wanted. But Mr. Crosbie had as yet knocked himself down\r\nto none of these biddings, having before him when he left London no\r\nother fixed engagement than that which took him to Allington. On the\r\nfirst of October we shall also find ourselves at Allington in company\r\nwith Johnny Eames; and Apollo Crosbie will still be there,--by no\r\nmeans to the comfort of our friend from the Income-tax Office.\r\n\r\nJohnny Eames cannot be called unlucky in that matter of his annual\r\nholiday, seeing that he was allowed to leave London in October, a\r\nmonth during which few chose to own that they remain in town. For\r\nmyself, I always regard May as the best month for holiday-making; but\r\nthen no Londoner cares to be absent in May. Young Eames, though he\r\nlived in Burton Crescent and had as yet no connection with the West\r\nEnd, had already learned his lesson in this respect. "Those fellows\r\nin the big room want me to take May," he had said to his friend\r\nCradell. "They must think I\'m uncommon green."\r\n\r\n"It\'s too bad," said Cradell. "A man shouldn\'t be asked to take his\r\nleave in May. I never did, and what\'s more, I never will. I\'d go to\r\nthe Board first."\r\n\r\nEames had escaped this evil without going to the Board, and had\r\nsucceeded in obtaining for himself for his own holiday that month of\r\nOctober, which, of all months, is perhaps the most highly esteemed\r\nfor holiday purposes. "I shall go down by the mail-train to-morrow\r\nnight," he said to Amelia Roper, on the evening before his departure.\r\nAt that moment he was sitting alone with Amelia in Mrs. Roper\'s back\r\ndrawing-room. In the front room Cradell was talking to Mrs. Lupex;\r\nbut as Miss Spruce was with them, it may be presumed that Mr. Lupex\r\nneed have had no cause for jealousy.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Amelia; "I know how great is your haste to get down to\r\nthat fascinating spot. I could not expect that you would lose one\r\nsingle hour in hurrying away from Burton Crescent."\r\n\r\nAmelia Roper was a tall, well-grown young woman, with dark hair and\r\ndark eyes;--not handsome, for her nose was thick, and the lower part\r\nof her face was heavy, but yet not without some feminine attractions.\r\nHer eyes were bright; but then, also, they were mischievous. She\r\ncould talk fluently enough; but then, also, she could scold. She\r\ncould assume sometimes the plumage of a dove; but then again she\r\ncould occasionally ruffle her feathers like an angry kite. I am quite\r\nprepared to acknowledge that John Eames should have kept himself\r\nclear of Amelia Roper; but then young men so frequently do those\r\nthings which they should not do!\r\n\r\n"After twelve months up here in London one is glad to get away to\r\none\'s own friends," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"Your own friends, Mr. Eames! What sort of friends? Do you suppose I\r\ndon\'t know?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no. I don\'t think you do know."\r\n\r\n"L. D.!" said Amelia, showing that Lily had been spoken of among\r\npeople who should never have been allowed to hear her name. But\r\nperhaps, after all, no more than those two initials were known in\r\nBurton Crescent. From the tone which was now used in naming them,\r\nit was sufficiently manifest that Amelia considered herself to be\r\nwronged by their very existence.\r\n\r\n"L. S. D.," said Johnny, attempting the line of a witty, gay young\r\nspendthrift. "That\'s my love--pounds, shillings, and pence; and a\r\nvery coy mistress she is."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, sir. Don\'t talk to me in that way. As if I didn\'t know\r\nwhere your heart was. What right had you to speak to me if you had an\r\nL. D. down in the country?"\r\n\r\nIt should be here declared on behalf of poor John Eames that he had\r\nnot ever spoken to Amelia--he had not spoken to her in any such\r\nphrase as her words seemed to imply. But then he had written to her\r\na fatal note of which we will speak further before long, and that\r\nperhaps was quite as bad,--or worse.\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Johnny. But the laugh was assumed, and not\r\nassumed with ease.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; it\'s a laughing matter to you, I dare say. It is very easy\r\nfor a man to laugh under such circumstances;--that is to say, if he\r\nis perfectly heartless,--if he\'s got a stone inside his bosom instead\r\nof flesh and blood. Some men are made of stone, I know, and are\r\ntroubled with no feelings."\r\n\r\n"What is it you want me to say? You pretend to know all about it, and\r\nit wouldn\'t be civil in me to contradict you."\r\n\r\n"What is it I want? You know very well what I want; or rather, I\r\ndon\'t want anything. What is it to me? It is nothing to me about L.\r\nD. You can go down to Allington and do what you like for me. Only\r\nI hate such ways."\r\n\r\n"What ways, Amelia?"\r\n\r\n"What ways! Now, look here, Johnny: I\'m not going to make a fool of\r\nmyself for any man. When I came home here three months ago--and I\r\nwish I never had;"--she paused here a moment, waiting for a word of\r\ntenderness; but as the word of tenderness did not come, she went\r\non--"but when I did come home, I didn\'t think there was a man in all\r\nLondon could make me care for him,--that I didn\'t. And now you\'re\r\ngoing away, without so much as hardly saying a word to me." And then\r\nshe brought out her handkerchief.\r\n\r\n"What am I to say, when you keep on scolding me all the time?"\r\n\r\n"Scolding you!--And me too! No, Johnny, I ain\'t scolding you, and\r\ndon\'t mean to. If it\'s to be all over between us, say the word, and\r\nI\'ll take myself away out of the house before you come back again.\r\nI\'ve had no secrets from you. I can go back to my business in\r\nManchester, though it is beneath my birth, and not what I\'ve been\r\nused to. If L. D. is more to you than I am, I won\'t stand in your\r\nway. Only say the word."\r\n\r\nL. D. was more to him than Amelia Roper,--ten times more to him. L.\r\nD. would have been everything to him, and Amelia Roper was worse\r\nthan nothing. He felt all this at the moment, and struggled hard to\r\ncollect an amount of courage that would make him free.\r\n\r\n"Say the word," said she, rising on her feet before him, "and all\r\nbetween you and me shall be over. I have got your promise, but I\'d\r\nscorn to take advantage. If Amelia hasn\'t got your heart, she\'d\r\ndespise to take your hand. Only I must have an answer."\r\n\r\nIt would seem that an easy way of escape was offered to him; but the\r\nlady probably knew that the way as offered by her was not easy to\r\nsuch an one as John Eames.\r\n\r\n"Amelia," he said, still keeping his seat.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir?"\r\n\r\n"You know I love you."\r\n\r\n"And about L. D.?"\r\n\r\n"If you choose to believe all the nonsense that Cradell puts into\r\nyour head, I can\'t help it. If you like to make yourself jealous\r\nabout two letters, it isn\'t my fault."\r\n\r\n"And you love me?" said she.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: "And you love me?" said she.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Of course I love you." And then, upon hearing these words, Amelia\r\nthrew herself into his arms.\r\n\r\nAs the folding doors between the two rooms were not closed, and as\r\nMiss Spruce was sitting in her easy chair immediately opposite to\r\nthem, it was probable that she saw what passed. But Miss Spruce was\r\na taciturn old lady, not easily excited to any show of surprise or\r\nadmiration; and as she had lived with Mrs. Roper for the last twelve\r\nyears, she was probably well acquainted with her daughter\'s ways.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be true to me?" said Amelia, during the moment of that\r\nembrace--"true to me for ever?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; that\'s a matter of course," said Johnny Eames. And then she\r\nliberated him; and the two strolled into the front sitting-room.\r\n\r\n"I declare, Mr. Eames," said Mrs. Lupex, "I\'m glad you\'ve come.\r\nHere\'s Mr. Cradell does say such queer things."\r\n\r\n"Queer things!" said Cradell. "Now, Miss Spruce, I appeal to\r\nyou--Have I said any queer things?"\r\n\r\n"If you did, sir, I didn\'t notice them," said Miss Spruce.\r\n\r\n"I noticed them, then," said Mrs. Lupex. "An unmarried man like Mr.\r\nCradell has no business to know whether a married lady wears a cap or\r\nher own hair--has he, Mr. Eames?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I ever know," said Johnny, not intending any sarcasm\r\non Mrs. Lupex.\r\n\r\n"I dare say not, sir," said the lady. "We all know where your\r\nattention is riveted. If you were to wear a cap, my dear, somebody\r\nwould see the difference very soon--wouldn\'t they, Miss Spruce?"\r\n\r\n"I dare say they would," said Miss Spruce.\r\n\r\n"If I could look as nice in a cap as you do, Mrs. Lupex, I\'d wear one\r\nto-morrow," said Amelia, who did not wish to quarrel with the married\r\nlady at the present moment. There were occasions, however, on which\r\nMrs. Lupex and Miss Roper were by no means so gracious to each other.\r\n\r\n"Does Lupex like caps?" asked Cradell.\r\n\r\n"If I wore a plumed helmet on my head, it\'s my belief he wouldn\'t\r\nknow the difference; nor yet if I had got no head at all. That\'s\r\nwhat comes of getting married. If you\'ll take my advice, Miss Roper,\r\nyou\'ll stay as you are; even though somebody should break his heart\r\nabout it. Wouldn\'t you, Miss Spruce?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, as for me, I\'m an old woman, you know," said Miss Spruce, which\r\nwas certainly true.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what any woman gets by marrying," continued Mrs. Lupex.\r\n"But a man gains everything. He don\'t know how to live, unless he\'s\r\ngot a woman to help him."\r\n\r\n"But is love to go for nothing?" said Cradell.\r\n\r\n"Oh, love! I don\'t believe in love. I suppose I thought I loved once,\r\nbut what did it come to after all? Now, there\'s Mr. Eames--we all\r\nknow he\'s in love."\r\n\r\n"It comes natural to me, Mrs. Lupex. I was born so," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"And there\'s Miss Roper--one never ought to speak free about a lady,\r\nbut perhaps she\'s in love too."\r\n\r\n"Speak for yourself, Mrs. Lupex," said Amelia.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no harm in saying that, is there? I\'m sure, if you ain\'t,\r\nyou\'re very hard-hearted; for, if ever there was a true lover, I\r\nbelieve you\'ve got one of your own. My!--if there\'s not Lupex\'s step\r\non the stair! What can bring him home at this hour? If he\'s been\r\ndrinking, he\'ll come home as cross as anything." Then Mr. Lupex\r\nentered the room, and the pleasantness of the party was destroyed.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that neither Mrs. Cradell nor Mrs. Eames would have\r\nplaced their sons in Burton Crescent if they had known the dangers\r\ninto which the young men would fall. Each, it must be acknowledged,\r\nwas imprudent; but each clearly saw the imprudence of the other. Not\r\na week before this, Cradell had seriously warned his friend against\r\nthe arts of Miss Roper. "By George, Johnny, you\'ll get yourself\r\nentangled with that girl."\r\n\r\n"One always has to go through that sort of thing," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"Yes; but those who go through too much of it never get out again.\r\nWhere would you be if she got a written promise of marriage from\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nPoor Johnny did not answer this immediately, for in very truth Amelia\r\nRoper had such a document in her possession.\r\n\r\n"Where should I be?" said he. "Among the breaches of promise, I\r\nsuppose."\r\n\r\n"Either that, or else among the victims of matrimony. My belief of\r\nyou is, that if you gave such a promise, you\'d carry it out."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I should," said Johnny; "but I don\'t know. It\'s a matter of\r\ndoubt what a man ought to do in such a case."\r\n\r\n"But there\'s been nothing of that kind yet?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no!"\r\n\r\n"If I was you, Johnny, I\'d keep away from her. It\'s very good fun, of\r\ncourse, that sort of thing; but it is so uncommon dangerous! Where\r\nwould you be now with such a girl as that for your wife?"\r\n\r\nSuch had been the caution given by Cradell to his friend. And now,\r\njust as he was starting for Allington, Eames returned the compliment.\r\nThey had gone together to the Great Western station at Paddington,\r\nand Johnny tendered his advice as they were walking together up and\r\ndown the platform.\r\n\r\n"I say, Caudle, old boy, you\'ll find yourself in trouble with that\r\nMrs. Lupex, if you don\'t take care of yourself."\r\n\r\n"But I shall take care of myself. There\'s nothing so safe as a little\r\nnonsense with a married woman. Of course, it means nothing, you know,\r\nbetween her and me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose it does mean anything. But she\'s always talking\r\nabout Lupex being jealous; and if he was to cut up rough, you\r\nwouldn\'t find it pleasant."\r\n\r\nCradell, however, seemed to think that there was no danger. His\r\nlittle affair with Mrs. Lupex was quite platonic and safe. As for\r\ndoing any real harm, his principles, as he assured his friend, were\r\ntoo high. Mrs. Lupex was a woman of talent, whom no one seemed to\r\nunderstand, and, therefore, he had taken some pleasure in studying\r\nher character. It was merely a study of character, and nothing more.\r\nThen the friends parted, and Eames was carried away by the night\r\nmail-train down to Guestwick.\r\n\r\nHow his mother was up to receive him at four o\'clock in the morning,\r\nhow her maternal heart was rejoicing at seeing the improvement in\r\nhis gait, and the manliness of appearance imparted to him by his\r\nwhiskers, I need not describe at length. Many of the attributes of\r\na hobbledehoy had fallen from him, and even Lily Dale might now\r\nprobably acknowledge that he was no longer a boy. All which might be\r\nregarded as good, if only in putting off childish things he had taken\r\nup things which were better than childish.\r\n\r\nOn the very first day of his arrival he made his way over to\r\nAllington. He did not walk on this occasion as he had used to do in\r\nthe old happy days. He had an idea that it might not be well for him\r\nto go into Mrs. Dale\'s drawing-room with the dust of the road on his\r\nboots, and the heat of the day on his brow. So he borrowed a horse\r\nand rode over, taking some pride in a pair of spurs which he had\r\nbought in Piccadilly, and in his kid gloves, which were brought out\r\nnew for the occasion. Alas, alas! I fear that those two years in\r\nLondon have not improved John Eames; and yet I have to acknowledge\r\nthat John Eames is one of the heroes of my story.\r\n\r\nOn entering Mrs. Dale\'s drawing-room he found Mrs. Dale and her\r\neldest daughter. Lily at the moment was not there, and as he shook\r\nhands with the other two, of course, he asked for her.\r\n\r\n"She is only in the garden," said Bell. "She will be here directly."\r\n\r\n"She has walked across to the Great House with Mr. Crosbie," said\r\nMrs. Dale; "but she is not going to remain. She will be so glad to\r\nsee you, John! We all expected you to-day."\r\n\r\n"Did you?" said Johnny, whose heart had been plunged into cold water\r\nat the mention of Mr. Crosbie\'s name. He had been thinking of Lilian\r\nDale ever since his friend had left him on the railway platform; and,\r\nas I beg to assure all ladies who may read my tale, the truth of his\r\nlove for Lily had moulted no feather through that unholy liaison\r\nbetween him and Miss Roper. I fear that I shall be disbelieved in\r\nthis; but it was so. His heart was and ever had been true to Lilian,\r\nalthough he had allowed himself to be talked into declarations of\r\naffection by such a creature as Amelia Roper. He had been thinking\r\nof his meeting with Lily all the night and throughout the morning,\r\nand now he heard that she was walking alone about the gardens with\r\na strange gentleman. That Mr. Crosbie was very grand and very\r\nfashionable he had heard, but he knew no more of him. Why should Mr.\r\nCrosbie be allowed to walk with Lily Dale? And why should Mrs. Dale\r\nmention the circumstance as though it were quite a thing of course?\r\nSuch mystery as there was in this was solved very quickly.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure Lily won\'t object to my telling such a dear friend as you\r\nwhat has happened," said Mrs. Dale. "She is engaged to be married to\r\nMr. Crosbie."\r\n\r\nThe water into which Johnny\'s heart had been plunged now closed over\r\nhis head and left him speechless. Lily Dale was engaged to be married\r\nto Mr. Crosbie! He knew that he should have spoken when he heard the\r\ntidings. He knew that the moments of silence as they passed by told\r\nhis secret to the two women before him,--that secret which it would\r\nnow behove him to conceal from all the world. But yet he could not\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n"We are all very well pleased at the match," said Mrs. Dale, wishing\r\nto spare him.\r\n\r\n"Nothing can be nicer than Mr. Crosbie," said Bell. "We have often\r\ntalked about you, and he will be so happy to know you."\r\n\r\n"He won\'t know much about me," said Johnny; and even in speaking\r\nthese few senseless words--words which he uttered because it was\r\nnecessary that he should say something--the tone of his voice was\r\naltered. He would have given the world to have been master of himself\r\nat this moment, but he felt that he was utterly vanquished.\r\n\r\n"There is Lily coming across the lawn," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"Then I\'d better go," said Eames. "Don\'t say anything about it; pray\r\ndon\'t." And then, without waiting for another word, he escaped out of\r\nthe drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nBEAUTIFUL DAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am well aware that I have not as yet given any description of Bell\r\nand Lilian Dale, and equally well aware that the longer the doing\r\nso is postponed the greater the difficulty becomes. I wish it could\r\nbe understood without any description that they were two pretty,\r\nfair-haired girls, of whom Bell was the tallest and the prettiest,\r\nwhereas Lily was almost as pretty as her sister, and perhaps was more\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\nThey were fair-haired girls, very like each other, of whom I have\r\nbefore my mind\'s eye a distinct portrait, which I fear I shall not be\r\nable to draw in any such manner as will make it distinct to others.\r\nThey were something below the usual height, being slight and slender\r\nin all their proportions. Lily was the shorter of the two, but the\r\ndifference was so trifling that it was hardly remembered unless the\r\ntwo were together. And when I said that Bell was the prettier, I\r\nshould, perhaps, have spoken more justly had I simply declared that\r\nher features were more regular than her sister\'s. The two girls\r\nwere very fair, so that the soft tint of colour which relieved the\r\nwhiteness of their complexion was rather acknowledged than distinctly\r\nseen. It was there, telling its own tale of health, as its absence\r\nwould have told a tale of present or coming sickness; and yet nobody\r\ncould ever talk about the colour in their cheeks. The hair of the two\r\ngirls was so alike in hue and texture, that no one, not even their\r\nmother, could say that there was a difference. It was not flaxen\r\nhair, and yet it was very light. Nor did it approach to auburn;\r\nand yet there ran through it a golden tint that gave it a distinct\r\nbrightness of its own. But with Bell it was more plentiful than\r\nwith Lily, and therefore Lily would always talk of her own scanty\r\nlocks, and tell how beautiful were those belonging to her sister.\r\nNevertheless Lily\'s head was quite as lovely as her sister\'s; for its\r\nform was perfect, and the simple braids in which they both wore their\r\nhair did not require any great exuberance in quantity. Their eyes\r\nwere brightly blue; but Bell\'s were long, and soft, and tender,\r\noften hardly daring to raise themselves to your face; while those\r\nof Lily were rounder, but brighter, and seldom kept by any want of\r\ncourage from fixing themselves where they pleased. And Lily\'s face\r\nwas perhaps less oval in its form--less perfectly oval--than her\r\nsister\'s. The shape of the forehead was, I think, the same, but with\r\nBell the chin was something more slender and delicate. But Bell\'s\r\nchin was unmarked, whereas on her sister\'s there was a dimple which\r\namply compensated for any other deficiency in its beauty. Bell\'s\r\nteeth were more even than her sister\'s; but then she showed her teeth\r\nmore frequently. Her lips were thinner and, as I cannot but think,\r\nless expressive. Her nose was decidedly more regular in its beauty,\r\nfor Lily\'s nose was somewhat broader than it should have been. It\r\nmay, therefore, be understood that Bell would be considered the\r\nbeauty by the family.\r\n\r\nBut there was, perhaps, more in the general impression made by\r\nthese girls, and in the whole tone of their appearance, than in the\r\nabsolute loveliness of their features or the grace of their figures.\r\nThere was about them a dignity of demeanour devoid of all stiffness\r\nor pride, and a maidenly modesty which gave itself no airs. In them\r\nwas always apparent that sense of security which women should receive\r\nfrom an unconscious dependence on their own mingled purity and\r\nweakness. These two girls were never afraid of men,--never looked as\r\nthough they were so afraid. And I may say that they had little cause\r\nfor that kind of fear to which I allude. It might be the lot of\r\neither of them to be ill-used by a man, but it was hardly possible\r\nthat either of them should ever be insulted by one. Lily, as may,\r\nperhaps, have been already seen, could be full of play, but in her\r\nplay she never so carried herself that any one could forget what was\r\ndue to her.\r\n\r\nAnd now Lily Dale was engaged to be married, and the days of her\r\nplayfulness were over. It sounds sad, this sentence against her, but\r\nI fear that it must be regarded as true. And when I think that it\r\nis true,--when I see that the sportiveness and kitten-like gambols\r\nof girlhood should be over, and generally are over, when a girl\r\nhas given her troth, it becomes a matter of regret to me that the\r\nfeminine world should be in such a hurry after matrimony. I have,\r\nhowever, no remedy to offer for the evil; and, indeed, am aware that\r\nthe evil, if there be an evil, is not well expressed in the words I\r\nhave used. The hurry is not for matrimony, but for love. Then, the\r\nlove once attained, matrimony seizes it for its own, and the evil is\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nAnd Lily Dale was engaged to be married to Adolphus Crosbie,--to\r\nApollo Crosbie, as she still called him, confiding her little joke\r\nto his own ears. And to her he was an Apollo, as a man who is loved\r\nshould be to the girl who loves him. He was handsome, graceful,\r\nclever, self-confident, and always cheerful when she asked him to be\r\ncheerful. But he had also his more serious moments, and could talk\r\nto her of serious matters. He would read to her, and explain to her\r\nthings which had hitherto been too hard for her young intelligence.\r\nHis voice, too, was pleasant, and well under command. It could be\r\npathetic if pathos were required, or ring with laughter as merry as\r\nher own. Was not such a man fit to be an Apollo to such a girl, when\r\nonce the girl had acknowledged to herself that she loved him?\r\n\r\nShe had acknowledged it to herself, and had acknowledged it to\r\nhim,--as the reader will perhaps say without much delay. But the\r\ncourtship had so been carried on that no delay had been needed. All\r\nthe world had smiled upon it. When Mr. Crosbie had first come among\r\nthem at Allington, as Bernard\'s guest, during those few days of his\r\nearly visit, it had seemed as though Bell had been chiefly noticed\r\nby him. And Bell in her own quiet way had accepted his admiration,\r\nsaying nothing of it and thinking but very little. Lily was\r\nheart-free at the time, and had ever been so. No first shadow from\r\nLove\'s wing had as yet been thrown across the pure tablets of her\r\nbosom. With Bell it was not so,--not so in absolute strictness.\r\nBell\'s story, too, must be told, but not on this page. But before\r\nCrosbie had come among them, it was a thing fixed in her mind that\r\nsuch love as she had felt must be overcome and annihilated. We may\r\nsay that it had been overcome and annihilated, and that she would\r\nhave sinned in no way had she listened to vows from this new Apollo.\r\nIt is almost sad to think that such a man might have had the love of\r\neither of such girls, but I fear that I must acknowledge that it was\r\nso. Apollo, in the plenitude of his power, soon changed his mind;\r\nand before the end of his first visit, had transferred the distant\r\nhomage which he was then paying from the elder to the younger sister.\r\nHe afterwards returned, as the squire\'s guest, for a longer sojourn\r\namong them, and at the end of the first month had already been\r\naccepted as Lily\'s future husband.\r\n\r\nIt was beautiful to see how Bell changed in her mood towards Crosbie\r\nand towards her sister as soon as she perceived how the affair was\r\ngoing. She was not long in perceiving it, having caught the first\r\nglimpses of the idea on that evening when they both dined at the\r\nGreat House, leaving their mother alone to eat or to neglect the\r\npeas. For some six or seven weeks Crosbie had been gone, and during\r\nthat time Bell had been much more open in speaking of him than her\r\nsister. She had been present when Crosbie had bid them good-by, and\r\nhad listened to his eagerness as he declared to Lily that he should\r\nsoon be back again at Allington. Lily had taken this very quietly,\r\nas though it had not belonged at all to herself; but Bell had seen\r\nsomething of the truth, and, believing in Crosbie as an earnest,\r\nhonest man, had spoken kind words of him, fostering any little\r\naptitude for love which might already have formed itself in Lily\'s\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\n"But he is such an Apollo, you know," Lily had said.\r\n\r\n"He is a gentleman; I can see that."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; a man can\'t be an Apollo unless he\'s a gentleman."\r\n\r\n"And he\'s very clever."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he is clever." There was nothing more said about his being\r\na mere clerk. Indeed, Lily had changed her mind on that subject.\r\nJohnny Eames was a mere clerk; whereas Crosbie, if he was to be\r\ncalled a clerk at all, was a clerk of some very special denomination.\r\nThere may be a great difference between one clerk and another! A\r\nClerk of the Council and a parish clerk are very different persons.\r\nLily had got some such idea as this into her head as she attempted\r\nin her own mind to rescue Mr. Crosbie from the lower orders of the\r\nGovernment service.\r\n\r\n"I wish he were not coming," Mrs. Dale had said to her eldest\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n"I think you are wrong, mamma."\r\n\r\n"But if she should become fond of him, and then--"\r\n\r\n"Lily will never become really fond of any man till he shall have\r\ngiven her proper reason. And if he admires her, why should they not\r\ncome together?"\r\n\r\n"But she is so young, Bell."\r\n\r\n"She is nineteen; and if they were engaged, perhaps, they might wait\r\nfor a year or so. But it\'s no good talking in that way, mamma. If you\r\nwere to tell Lily not to give him encouragement, she would not speak\r\nto him."\r\n\r\n"I should not think of interfering."\r\n\r\n"No, mamma; and therefore it must take its course. For myself, I like\r\nMr. Crosbie very much."\r\n\r\n"So do I, my dear."\r\n\r\n"And so does my uncle. I wouldn\'t have Lily take a lover of my\r\nuncle\'s choosing."\r\n\r\n"I should hope not."\r\n\r\n"But it must be considered a good thing if she happens to choose one\r\nof his liking."\r\n\r\nIn this way the matter had been talked over between the mother and\r\nher elder daughter. Then Mr. Crosbie had come; and before the end\r\nof the first month his declared admiration for Lily had proved\r\nthe correctness of her sister\'s foresight. And during that short\r\ncourtship all had gone well with the lovers. The squire from the\r\nfirst had declared himself satisfied with the match, informing Mrs.\r\nDale, in his cold manner, that Mr. Crosbie was a gentleman with an\r\nincome sufficient for matrimony.\r\n\r\n"It would be close enough in London," Mrs. Dale had said.\r\n\r\n"He has more than my brother had when he married," said the squire.\r\n\r\n"If he will only make her as happy as your brother made me,--while\r\nit lasted!" said Mrs. Dale, as she turned away her face to conceal a\r\ntear that was coming. And then there was nothing more said about it\r\nbetween the squire and his sister-in-law. The squire spoke no word as\r\nto assistance in money matters,--did not even suggest that he would\r\nlend a hand to the young people at starting, as an uncle in such a\r\nposition might surely have done. It may well be conceived that Mrs.\r\nDale herself said nothing on the subject. And, indeed, it may be\r\nconceived, also, that the squire, let his intentions be what they\r\nmight, would not divulge them to Mrs. Dale. This was uncomfortable,\r\nbut the position was one that was well understood between them.\r\n\r\nBernard Dale was still at Allington, and had remained there through\r\nthe period of Crosbie\'s absence. Whatever words Mrs. Dale might\r\nchoose to speak on the matter would probably be spoken to him; but,\r\nthen, Bernard could be quite as close as his uncle. When Crosbie\r\nreturned, he and Bernard had, of course, lived much together; and, as\r\nwas natural, there came to be close discussion between them as to the\r\ntwo girls, when Crosbie allowed it to be understood that his liking\r\nfor Lily was becoming strong.\r\n\r\n"You know, I suppose, that my uncle wishes me to marry the elder\r\none," Bernard had said.\r\n\r\n"I have guessed as much."\r\n\r\n"And I suppose the match will come off. She\'s a pretty girl, and as\r\ngood as gold."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she is."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t pretend to be very much in love with her. It\'s not my way,\r\nyou know. But, some of these days, I shall ask her to have me, and\r\nI suppose it\'ll all go right. The governor has distinctly promised\r\nto allow me eight hundred a year off the estate, and to take us in\r\nfor three months every year if we wish it. I told him simply that I\r\ncouldn\'t do it for less, and he agreed with me."\r\n\r\n"You and he get on very well together."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes! There\'s never been any fal-lal between us about love, and\r\nduty, and all that. I think we understand each other, and that\'s\r\neverything. He knows the comfort of standing well with the heir,\r\nand I know the comfort of standing well with the owner." It must be\r\nadmitted, I think, that there was a great deal of sound, common sense\r\nabout Bernard Dale.\r\n\r\n"What will he do for the younger sister?" asked Crosbie; and, as he\r\nasked the important question, a close observer might have perceived\r\nthat there was some slight tremor in his voice.\r\n\r\n"Ah! that\'s more than I can tell you. If I were you, I should ask\r\nhim. The governor is a plain man, and likes plain business."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you couldn\'t ask him?"\r\n\r\n"No; I don\'t think I could. It is my belief that he will not let her\r\ngo by any means empty-handed."\r\n\r\n"Well, I should suppose not."\r\n\r\n"But remember this, Crosbie,--I can say nothing to you on which you\r\nare to depend. Lily, also, is as good as gold; and, as you seem to\r\nbe fond of her, I should ask the governor, if I were you, in so many\r\nwords, what he intends to do. Of course, it\'s against my interest,\r\nfor every shilling he gives Lily will ultimately come out of my\r\npocket. But I\'m not the man to care about that, as you know."\r\n\r\nWhat might be Crosbie\'s knowledge on this subject we will not here\r\ninquire; but we may say that it would have mattered very little to\r\nhim out of whose pocket the money came, so long as it went into his\r\nown. When he felt quite sure of Lily,--having, in fact, received\r\nLily\'s permission to speak to her uncle, and Lily\'s promise that she\r\nwould herself speak to her mother,--he did tell the squire what was\r\nhis intention. This he did in an open, manly way, as though he felt\r\nthat in asking for much he also offered to give much.\r\n\r\n"I have nothing to say against it," said the squire.\r\n\r\n"And I have your permission to consider myself as engaged to her?"\r\n\r\n"If you have hers and her mother\'s. Of course you are aware that I\r\nhave no authority over her."\r\n\r\n"She would not marry without your sanction."\r\n\r\n"She is very good to think so much of her uncle," said the squire;\r\nand his words as he spoke them sounded very cold in Crosbie\'s ears.\r\nAfter that Crosbie said nothing about money, having to confess to\r\nhimself that he was afraid to do so. "And what would be the use?"\r\nsaid he to himself, wishing to make excuses for what he felt to be\r\nweak in his own conduct. "If he should refuse to give her a shilling\r\nI could not go back from it now." And then some ideas ran across his\r\nmind as to the injustice to which men are subjected in this matter of\r\nmatrimony. A man has to declare himself before it is fitting that he\r\nshould make any inquiry about a lady\'s money; and then, when he has\r\ndeclared himself, any such inquiry is unavailing. Which consideration\r\nsomewhat cooled the ardour of his happiness. Lily Dale was very\r\npretty, very nice, very refreshing in her innocence, her purity,\r\nand her quick intelligence. No amusement could be more deliciously\r\namusing than that of making love to Lily Dale. Her way of flattering\r\nher lover without any intention of flattery on her part, had put\r\nCrosbie into a seventh heaven. In all his experience he had known\r\nnothing like it. "You may be sure of this," she had said,--"I\r\nshall love you with all my heart and all my strength." It was very\r\nnice;--but then what were they to live upon? Could it be that he,\r\nAdolphus Crosbie, should settle down on the north side of the New\r\nRoad, as a married man, with eight hundred a year? If indeed the\r\nsquire would be as good to Lily as he had promised to be to Bell,\r\nthen indeed things might be made to arrange themselves.\r\n\r\nBut there was no such drawback on Lily\'s happiness. Her ideas about\r\nmoney were rather vague, but they were very honest. She knew she had\r\nnone of her own, but supposed it was a husband\'s duty to find what\r\nwould be needful. She knew she had none of her own, and was therefore\r\naware that she ought not to expect luxuries in the little household\r\nthat was to be prepared for her. She hoped, for his sake, that her\r\nuncle might give some assistance, but was quite prepared to prove\r\nthat she could be a good poor man\'s wife. In the old colloquies on\r\nsuch matters between her and her sister, she had always declared that\r\nsome decent income should be considered as indispensable before love\r\ncould be entertained. But eight hundred a year had been considered\r\nas doing much more than fulfilling this stipulation. Bell had had\r\nhigh-flown notions as to the absolute glory of poverty. She had\r\ndeclared that income should not be considered at all. If she had\r\nloved a man, she could allow herself to be engaged to him, even\r\nthough he had no income. Such had been their theories; and as\r\nregarded money, Lily was quite contented with the way in which she\r\nhad carried out her own.\r\n\r\nIn these beautiful days there was nothing to check her happiness. Her\r\nmother and sister united in telling her that she had done well,--that\r\nshe was happy in her choice, and justified in her love. On that first\r\nday, when she told her mother all, she had been made exquisitely\r\nblissful by the way in which her tidings had been received.\r\n\r\n"Oh! mamma, I must tell you something," she said, coming up to her\r\nmother\'s bedroom, after a long ramble with Mr. Crosbie through those\r\nAllington fields.\r\n\r\n"Is it about Mr. Crosbie?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma." And then the rest had been said through the medium of\r\nwarm embraces and happy tears rather than by words.\r\n\r\nAs she sat in her mother\'s room, hiding her face on her mother\'s\r\nshoulders, Bell had come, and had knelt at her feet.\r\n\r\n"Dear Lily," she had said, "I am so glad." And then Lily remembered\r\nhow she had, as it were, stolen her lover from her sister, and she\r\nput her arms round Bell\'s neck and kissed her.\r\n\r\n"I knew how it was going to be from the very first," said Bell. "Did\r\nI not, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I didn\'t," said Lily. "I never thought such a thing was\r\npossible."\r\n\r\n"But we did,--mamma and I."\r\n\r\n"Did you?" said Lily.\r\n\r\n"Bell told me that it was to be so," said Mrs. Dale. "But I could\r\nhardly bring myself at first to think that he was good enough for my\r\ndarling."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma! you must not say that. You must think that he is good\r\nenough for anything."\r\n\r\n"I will think that he is very good."\r\n\r\n"Who could be better? And then, when you remember all that he is to\r\ngive up for my sake!--And what can I do for him in return? What have\r\nI got to give him?"\r\n\r\nNeither Mrs. Dale nor Bell could look at the matter in this light,\r\nthinking that Lily gave quite as much as she received. But they both\r\ndeclared that Crosbie was perfect, knowing that by such assurances\r\nonly could they now administer to Lily\'s happiness; and Lily, between\r\nthem, was made perfect in her happiness, receiving all manner of\r\nencouragement in her love, and being nourished in her passion by the\r\nsympathy and approval of her mother and sister.\r\n\r\nAnd then had come that visit from Johnny Eames. As the poor fellow\r\nmarched out of the room, giving them no time to say farewell, Mrs.\r\nDale and Bell looked at each other sadly; but they were unable to\r\nconcoct any arrangement, for Lily had run across the lawn, and was\r\nalready on the ground before the window.\r\n\r\n"As soon as we got to the end of the shrubbery there were uncle\r\nChristopher and Bernard close to us; so I told Adolphus he might go\r\non by himself."\r\n\r\n"And who do you think has been here?" said Bell. But Mrs. Dale said\r\nnothing. Had time been given to her to use her own judgment, nothing\r\nshould have been said at that moment as to Johnny\'s visit.\r\n\r\n"Has anybody been here since I went? Whoever it was didn\'t stay very\r\nlong."\r\n\r\n"Poor Johnny Eames," said Bell. Then the colour came up into Lily\'s\r\nface, and she bethought herself in a moment that the old friend of\r\nher young days had loved her, that he, too, had had hopes as to his\r\nlove, and that now he had heard tidings which would put an end to\r\nsuch hopes. She understood it all in a moment, but understood also\r\nthat it was necessary that she should conceal such understanding.\r\n\r\n"Dear Johnny!" she said. "Why did he not wait for me?"\r\n\r\n"We told him you were out," said Mrs. Dale. "He will be here again\r\nbefore long, no doubt."\r\n\r\n"And he knows--?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I thought you would not object to my telling him."\r\n\r\n"No, mamma; of course not. And he has gone back to Guestwick?"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer given to this question, nor were there any\r\nfurther words then spoken about Johnny Eames. Each of these women\r\nunderstood exactly how the matter stood, and each knew that the\r\nothers understood it. The young man was loved by them all, but not\r\nloved with that sort of admiring affection which had been accorded to\r\nMr. Crosbie. Johnny Eames could not have been accepted as a suitor\r\nby their pet. Mrs. Dale and Bell both felt that. And yet they loved\r\nhim for his love, and for that distant, modest respect which had\r\nrestrained him from any speech regarding it. Poor Johnny! But he\r\nwas young,--hardly as yet out of his hobbledehoyhood,--and he would\r\neasily recover this blow, remembering, and perhaps feeling to his\r\nadvantage, some slight touch of its passing romance. It is thus women\r\nthink of men who love young and love in vain.\r\n\r\nBut Johnny Eames himself, as he rode back to Guestwick, forgetful\r\nof his spurs, and with his gloves stuffed into his pocket, thought\r\nof the matter very differently. He had never promised to himself\r\nany success as to his passion for Lily, and had, indeed, always\r\nacknowledged that he could have no hope; but now, that she was\r\nactually promised to another man, and as good as married, he was not\r\nthe less broken-hearted because his former hopes had not been high.\r\nHe had never dared to speak to Lily of his love, but he was conscious\r\nthat she knew it, and he did not now dare to stand before her as\r\none convicted of having loved in vain. And then, as he rode back,\r\nhe thought also of his other love, not with many of those pleasant\r\nthoughts which Lotharios and Don Juans may be presumed to enjoy when\r\nthey contemplate their successes. "I suppose I shall marry her, and\r\nthere\'ll be an end of me," he said to himself, as he remembered a\r\nshort note which he had once written to her in his madness. There had\r\nbeen a little supper at Mrs. Roper\'s, and Mrs. Lupex and Amelia had\r\nmade the punch. After supper, he had been by some accident alone with\r\nAmelia in the dining-parlour; and when, warmed by the generous god,\r\nhe had declared his passion, she had shaken her head mournfully,\r\nand had fled from him to some upper region, absolutely refusing\r\nhis proffered embrace. But on the same night, before his head had\r\nfound its pillow, a note had come to him, half repentant, half\r\naffectionate, half repellent,--"If, indeed, he would swear to her\r\nthat his love was honest and manly, then, indeed, she might even\r\nyet,--see him through the chink of the doorway with the purport of\r\ntelling him that he was forgiven." Whereupon, a perfidious pencil\r\nbeing near to his hand, he had written the requisite words. "My\r\nonly object in life is to call you my own for ever." Amelia had her\r\nmisgivings whether such a promise, in order that it might be used as\r\nlegal evidence, should not have been written in ink. It was a painful\r\ndoubt; but nevertheless she was as good as her word, and saw him\r\nthrough the chink, forgiving him for his impetuosity in the parlour\r\nwith, perhaps, more clemency than a mere pardon required. "By George!\r\nhow well she looked with her hair all loose," he said to himself, as\r\nhe at last regained his pillow, still warm with the generous god.\r\nBut now, as he thought of that night, returning on his road from\r\nAllington to Guestwick, those loose, floating locks were remembered\r\nby him with no strong feeling as to their charms. And he thought also\r\nof Lily Dale, as she was when he had said farewell to her on that day\r\nbefore he first went up to London. "I shall care more about seeing\r\nyou than anybody," he had said; and he had often thought of the words\r\nsince, wondering whether she had understood them as meaning more than\r\nan assurance of ordinary friendship. And he remembered well the dress\r\nshe had then worn. It was an old brown merino, which he had known\r\nbefore, and which, in truth, had nothing in it to recommend it\r\nspecially to a lover\'s notice. "Horrid old thing!" had been Lily\'s\r\nown verdict respecting the frock, even before that day. But she\r\nhad hallowed it in his eyes, and he would have been only too happy\r\nto have worn a shred of it near his heart, as a talisman. How\r\nwonderful in its nature is that passion of which men speak when they\r\nacknowledge to themselves that they are in love. Of all things, it\r\nis, under one condition, the most foul, and under another, the most\r\nfair. As that condition is, a man shows himself either as a beast\r\nor as a god! And so we will let poor Johnny Eames ride back to\r\nGuestwick, suffering much in that he had loved basely--and suffering\r\nmuch, also, in that he had loved nobly.\r\n\r\nLily, as she had tripped along through the shrubbery, under her\r\nlover\'s arm, looking up, every other moment, into his face, had\r\nespied her uncle and Bernard. "Stop," she had said, giving him a\r\nlittle pull at the arm; "I won\'t go on. Uncle is always teasing me\r\nwith some old-fashioned wit. And I\'ve had quite enough of you to-day,\r\nsir. Mind you come over to-morrow before you go to your shooting."\r\nAnd so she had left him.\r\n\r\nWe may as well learn here what was the question in dispute between\r\nthe uncle and cousin, as they were walking there on the broad gravel\r\npath behind the Great House. "Bernard," the old man had said, "I wish\r\nthis matter could be settled between you and Bell."\r\n\r\n"Is there any hurry about it, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, there is hurry; or, rather, as I hate hurry in all things, I\r\nwould say that there is ground for despatch. Mind, I do not wish to\r\ndrive you. If you do not like your cousin, say so."\r\n\r\n"But I do like her; only I have a sort of feeling that these things\r\ngrow best by degrees. I quite share your dislike to being in a\r\nhurry."\r\n\r\n"But time enough has been taken now. You see, Bernard, I am going to\r\nmake a great sacrifice of income on your behalf."\r\n\r\n"I am sure I am very grateful."\r\n\r\n"I have no children, and have therefore always regarded you as my\r\nown. But there is no reason why my brother Philip\'s daughter should\r\nnot be as dear to me as my brother Orlando\'s son."\r\n\r\n"Of course not, sir; or, rather, his two daughters."\r\n\r\n"You may leave that matter to me, Bernard. The younger girl is going\r\nto marry this friend of yours, and as he has a sufficient income to\r\nsupport a wife, I think that my sister-in-law has good reason to be\r\nsatisfied by the match. She will not be expected to give up any part\r\nof her small income, as she must have done had Lily married a poor\r\nman."\r\n\r\n"I suppose she could hardly give up much."\r\n\r\n"People must be guided by circumstances. I am not disposed to put\r\nmyself in the place of a parent to them both. There is no reason\r\nwhy I should, and I will not encourage false hopes. If I knew that\r\nthis matter between you and Bell was arranged, I should have reason\r\nto feel satisfied with what I was doing." From all which Bernard\r\nbegan to perceive that poor Crosbie\'s expectations in the matter of\r\nmoney would not probably receive much gratification. But he also\r\nperceived--or thought that he perceived--a kind of threat in this\r\nwarning from his uncle. "I have promised you eight hundred a year\r\nwith your wife," the warning seemed to say. "But if you do not at\r\nonce accept it, or let me feel that it will be accepted, it may be\r\nwell for me to change my mind--especially as this other niece is\r\nabout to be married. If I am to give you so large a fortune with\r\nBell, I need do nothing for Lily. But if you do not choose to take\r\nBell and the fortune, why then--" And so on. It was thus that Bernard\r\nread his uncle\'s caution, as they walked together on the broad gravel\r\npath.\r\n\r\n"I have no desire to postpone the matter any longer," said Bernard.\r\n"I will propose to Bell at once, if you wish it."\r\n\r\n"If your mind be quite made up, I cannot see why you should delay\r\nit."\r\n\r\nAnd then, having thus arranged that matter, they received their\r\nfuture relative with kind smiles and soft words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF TROUBLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: (untitled)]\r\n\r\nLily, as she parted with her lover in the garden, had required of him\r\nto attend upon her the next morning as he went to his shooting, and\r\nin obedience to this command he appeared on Mrs. Dale\'s lawn after\r\nbreakfast, accompanied by Bernard and two dogs. The men had guns in\r\ntheir hands, and were got up with all proper sporting appurtenances,\r\nbut it so turned out that they did not reach the stubble-fields on\r\nthe farther side of the road until after luncheon. And may it not be\r\nfairly doubted whether croquet is not as good as shooting when a man\r\nis in love?\r\n\r\nIt will be said that Bernard Dale was not in love; but they who bring\r\nsuch accusation against him, will bring it falsely. He was in love\r\nwith his cousin Bell according to his manner and fashion. It was not\r\nhis nature to love Bell as John Eames loved Lily; but then neither\r\nwould his nature bring him into such a trouble as that which the\r\ncharms of Amelia Roper had brought upon the poor clerk from the\r\nIncome-tax Office. Johnny was susceptible, as the word goes; whereas\r\nCaptain Dale was a man who had his feelings well under control. He\r\nwas not one to make a fool of himself about a girl, or to die of a\r\nbroken heart; but, nevertheless, he would probably love his wife when\r\nhe got a wife, and would be a careful father to his children.\r\n\r\nThey were very intimate with each other now,--these four. It was\r\nBernard and Adolphus, or sometimes Apollo, and Bell and Lily among\r\nthem; and Crosbie found it to be pleasant enough. A new position\r\nof life had come upon him, and one exceeding pleasant; but,\r\nnevertheless, there were moments in which cold fits of a melancholy\r\nnature came upon him. He was doing the very thing which throughout\r\nall the years of his manhood he had declared to himself that he\r\nwould not do. According to his plan of life he was to have eschewed\r\nmarriage, and to have allowed himself to regard it as a possible\r\nevent only under the circumstances of wealth, rank, and beauty all\r\ncoming in his way together. As he had expected no such glorious\r\nprize, he had regarded himself as a man who would reign at the\r\nBeaufort and be potent at Sebright\'s to the end of his chapter. But\r\nnow--\r\n\r\nIt was the fact that he had fallen from his settled position,\r\nvanquished by a silver voice, a pretty wit, and a pair of moderately\r\nbright eyes. He was very fond of Lily, having in truth a stronger\r\ncapability for falling in love than his friend Captain Dale; but was\r\nthe sacrifice worth his while? This was the question which he asked\r\nhimself in those melancholy moments; while he was lying in bed,\r\nfor instance, awake in the morning, when he was shaving himself,\r\nand sometimes also when the squire was prosy after dinner. At\r\nsuch times as these, while he would be listening to Mr. Dale, his\r\nself-reproaches would sometimes be very bitter. Why should he undergo\r\nthis, he, Crosbie of Sebright\'s, Crosbie of the General Committee\r\nOffice, Crosbie who would allow no one to bore him between Charing\r\nCross and the far end of Bayswater,--why should he listen to the\r\nlong-winded stories of such a one as Squire Dale? If, indeed, the\r\nsquire intended to be liberal to his niece, then it might be very\r\nwell. But as yet the squire had given no sign of such intention, and\r\nCrosbie was angry with himself in that he had not had the courage to\r\nask a question on that subject.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the course of love was not all smooth to our Apollo. It was\r\nstill pleasant for him when he was there on the croquet ground, or\r\nsitting in Mrs. Dale\'s drawing-room with all the privileges of an\r\naccepted lover. It was pleasant to him also as he sipped the squire\'s\r\nclaret, knowing that his coffee would soon be handed to him by a\r\nsweet girl who would have tripped across the two gardens on purpose\r\nto perform for him this service. There is nothing pleasanter than all\r\nthis, although a man when so treated does feel himself to look like a\r\ncalf at the altar, ready for the knife, with blue ribbons round his\r\nhorns and neck. Crosbie felt that he was such a calf,--and the more\r\ncalf-like, in that he had not as yet dared to ask a question about\r\nhis wife\'s fortune. "I will have it out of the old fellow this\r\nevening," he said to himself, as he buttoned on his dandy shooting\r\ngaiters that morning.\r\n\r\n"How nice he looks in them," Lily said to her sister afterwards,\r\nknowing nothing of the thoughts which had troubled her lover\'s mind\r\nwhile he was adorning his legs.\r\n\r\n"I suppose we shall come back this way," Crosbie said, as they\r\nprepared to move away on their proper business when lunch was over.\r\n\r\n"Well, not exactly!" said Bernard. "We shall make our way round by\r\nDarvell\'s farm, and so back by Gruddock\'s. Are the girls going to\r\ndine up at the Great House to-day?"\r\n\r\nThe girls declared that they were not going to dine up at the Great\r\nHouse,--that they did not intend going to the Great House at all that\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n"Then, as you won\'t have to dress, you might as well meet us at\r\nGruddock\'s gate, at the back of the farmyard. We\'ll be there exactly\r\nat half-past five."\r\n\r\n"That is to say, we\'re to be there at half-past five, and you\'ll keep\r\nus waiting for three-quarters of an hour," said Lily. Nevertheless\r\nthe arrangement as proposed was made, and the two ladies were not\r\nat all unwilling to make it. It is thus that the game is carried on\r\namong unsophisticated people who really live in the country. The\r\nfarmyard gate at Farmer Gruddock\'s has not a fitting sound as a\r\ntrysting-place in romance, but for people who are in earnest it does\r\nas well as any oak in the middle glade of a forest. Lily Dale was\r\nquite in earnest--and so indeed was Adolphus Crosbie,--only with him\r\nthe earnest was beginning to take that shade of brown which most\r\nearnest things have to wear in this vale of tears. With Lily it\r\nwas as yet all rose-coloured. And Bernard Dale was also in earnest.\r\nThroughout this morning he had stood very near to Bell on the\r\nlawn, and had thought that his cousin did not receive his little\r\nwhisperings with any aversion. Why should she? Lucky girl that she\r\nwas, thus to have eight hundred a year pinned to her skirt!\r\n\r\n"I say, Dale," Crosbie said, as in the course of their day\'s work\r\nthey had come round upon Gruddock\'s ground, and were preparing to\r\nfinish off his turnips before they reached the farm-yard gate. And\r\nnow, as Crosbie spoke, they stood leaning on the gate, looking at the\r\nturnips while the two dogs squatted on their haunches. Crosbie had\r\nbeen very silent for the last mile or two, and had been making up his\r\nmind for this conversation. "I say, Dale,--your uncle has never said\r\na word to me yet as to Lily\'s fortune."\r\n\r\n"As to Lily\'s fortune! The question is whether Lily has got a\r\nfortune."\r\n\r\n"He can hardly expect that I am to take her without something. Your\r\nuncle is a man of the world and he knows--"\r\n\r\n"Whether or no my uncle is a man of the world, I will not say; but\r\nyou are, Crosbie, whether he is or not. Lily, as you have always\r\nknown, has nothing of her own."\r\n\r\n"I am not talking of Lily\'s own. I\'m speaking of her uncle. I have\r\nbeen straightforward with him; and when I became attached to your\r\ncousin I declared what I meant at once."\r\n\r\n"You should have asked him the question, if you thought there was any\r\nroom for such a question."\r\n\r\n"Thought there was any room! Upon my word, you are a cool fellow."\r\n\r\n"Now look here, Crosbie; you may say what you like about my uncle,\r\nbut you must not say a word against Lily."\r\n\r\n"Who is going to say a word against her? You can little understand me\r\nif you don\'t know that the protection of her name against evil words\r\nis already more my care than it is yours. I regard Lily as my own."\r\n\r\n"I only meant to say, that any discontent you may feel as to her\r\nmoney, or want of money, you must refer to my uncle, and not to the\r\nfamily at the Small House."\r\n\r\n"I am quite well aware of that."\r\n\r\n"And though you are quite at liberty to say what you like to me about\r\nmy uncle, I cannot say that I can see that he has been to blame."\r\n\r\n"He should have told me what her prospects are."\r\n\r\n"But if she have got no prospects! It cannot be an uncle\'s duty to\r\ntell everybody that he does not mean to give his niece a fortune. In\r\npoint of fact, why should you suppose that he has such an intention?"\r\n\r\n"Do you know that he has not? because you once led me to believe that\r\nhe would give his niece money."\r\n\r\n"Now, Crosbie, it is necessary that you and I should understand each\r\nother in this matter--"\r\n\r\n"But did you not?"\r\n\r\n"Listen to me for a moment. I never said a word to you about my\r\nuncle\'s intentions in any way, until after you had become fully\r\nengaged to Lily with the knowledge of us all. Then, when my belief on\r\nthe subject could make no possible difference in your conduct, I told\r\nyou that I thought my uncle would do something for her. I told you so\r\nbecause I did think so;--and as your friend, I should have told you\r\nwhat I thought in any matter that concerned your interest."\r\n\r\n"And now you have changed your opinion?"\r\n\r\n"I have changed my opinion; but very probably without sufficient\r\nground."\r\n\r\n"That\'s hard upon me."\r\n\r\n"It may be hard to bear disappointment; but you cannot say that\r\nanybody has ill-used you."\r\n\r\n"And you don\'t think he will give her anything?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing that will be of much moment to you."\r\n\r\n"And I\'m not to say that that\'s hard? I think it confounded hard. Of\r\ncourse I must put off my marriage."\r\n\r\n"Why do you not speak to my uncle?"\r\n\r\n"I shall do so. To tell the truth, I think it would have come better\r\nfrom him; but that is a matter of opinion. I shall tell him very\r\nplainly what I think about it; and if he is angry, why, I suppose I\r\nmust leave his house; that will be all."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Crosbie; do not begin your conversation with the purpose\r\nof angering him. He is not a bad-hearted man, but is very obstinate."\r\n\r\n"I can be quite as obstinate as he is." And, then, without further\r\nparley, they went in among the turnips, and each swore against\r\nhis luck as he missed his birds. There are certain phases of mind\r\nin which a man can neither ride nor shoot, nor play a stroke at\r\nbilliards, nor remember a card at whist,--and to such a phase of mind\r\nhad come both Crosbie and Dale after their conversation over the\r\ngate.\r\n\r\nThey were not above fifteen minutes late at the trysting-place, but\r\nnevertheless, punctual though they had been, the girls were there\r\nbefore them. Of course the first inquiries were made about the game,\r\nand of course the gentlemen declared that the birds were scarcer\r\nthan they had ever been before, that the dogs were wilder, and their\r\nluck more excruciatingly bad,--to all which apologies very little\r\nattention was paid. Lily and Bell had not come there to inquire after\r\npartridges, and would have forgiven the sportsmen even though no\r\nsingle bird had been killed. But they could not forgive the want of\r\ngood spirits which was apparent.\r\n\r\n"I declare I don\'t know what\'s the matter with you," Lily said to her\r\nlover.\r\n\r\n"We have been over fifteen miles of ground, and--"\r\n\r\n"I never knew anything so lackadaisical as you gentlemen from London.\r\nBeen over fifteen miles of ground! Why, uncle Christopher would think\r\nnothing of that."\r\n\r\n"Uncle Christopher is made of sterner stuff than we are," said\r\nCrosbie. "They used to be born so sixty or seventy years ago." And\r\nthen they walked on through Gruddock\'s fields, and the home paddocks,\r\nback to the Great House, where they found the squire standing in the\r\nfront of the porch.\r\n\r\nThe walk had not been so pleasant as they had all intended that\r\nit should be when they made their arrangements for it. Crosbie\r\nhad endeavoured to recover his happy state of mind, but had been\r\nunsuccessful; and Lily, fancying that her lover was not all that he\r\nshould be, had become reserved and silent. Bernard and Bell had not\r\nshared this discomfiture, but then Bernard and Bell were, as a rule,\r\nmuch more given to silence than the other two.\r\n\r\n"Uncle," said Lily, "these men have shot nothing, and you cannot\r\nconceive how unhappy they are in consequence. It\'s all the fault of\r\nthe naughty partridges."\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: "It\'s all the fault of the naughty partridges."]\r\n\r\n\r\n"There are plenty of partridges if they knew how to get them," said\r\nthe squire.\r\n\r\n"The dogs are uncommonly wild," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"They are not wild with me," said the squire; "nor yet with Dingles."\r\nDingles was the squire\'s gamekeeper. "The fact is, you young men,\r\nnowadays, expect to have dogs trained to do all the work for you.\r\nIt\'s too much labour for you to walk up to your game. You\'ll be late\r\nfor dinner, girls, if you don\'t look sharp."\r\n\r\n"We\'re not coming up this evening, sir," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"And why not?"\r\n\r\n"We\'re going to stay with mamma."\r\n\r\n"And why will not your mother come with you? I\'ll be whipped if I\r\ncan understand it. One would have thought that under the present\r\ncircumstances she would have been glad to see you all as much\r\ntogether as possible."\r\n\r\n"We\'re together quite enough," said Lily. "And as for mamma, I\r\nsuppose she thinks--" And then she stopped herself, catching the\r\nglance of Bell\'s imploring eye. She was going to make some indignant\r\nexcuse for her mother,--some excuse which would be calculated to make\r\nher uncle angry. It was her practice to say such sharp words to him,\r\nand consequently he did not regard her as warmly as her more silent\r\nand more prudent sister. At the present moment he turned quickly\r\nround and went into the house; and then, with a very few words of\r\nfarewell, the two young men followed him. The girls went back over\r\nthe little bridge by themselves, feeling that the afternoon had not\r\ngone off altogether well.\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t provoke him, Lily," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"And he shouldn\'t say those things about mamma. It seems to me that\r\nyou don\'t mind what he says."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lily."\r\n\r\n"No more you do. He makes me so angry that I cannot hold my tongue.\r\nHe thinks that because all the place is his, he is to say just what\r\nhe likes. Why should mamma go up there to please his humours?"\r\n\r\n"You may be sure that mamma will do what she thinks best. She is\r\nstronger-minded than uncle Christopher, and does not want any one to\r\nhelp her. But, Lily, you shouldn\'t speak as though I were careless\r\nabout mamma. You didn\'t mean that, I know."\r\n\r\n"Of course I didn\'t." Then the two girls joined their mother in their\r\nown little domain; but we will return to the men at the Great House.\r\n\r\nCrosbie, when he went up to dress for dinner, fell into one of those\r\nmelancholy fits of which I have spoken. Was he absolutely about to\r\ndestroy all the good that he had done for himself throughout the past\r\nyears of his hitherto successful life? or rather, as he at last put\r\nthe question to himself more strongly,--was it not the case that\r\nhe had already destroyed all that success? His marriage with Lily,\r\nwhether it was to be for good or bad, was now a settled thing, and\r\nwas not regarded as a matter admitting of any doubt. To do the man\r\njustice, I must declare that in all these moments of misery he still\r\ndid the best he could to think of Lily herself as of a great treasure\r\nwhich he had won,--as of a treasure which should, and perhaps would,\r\ncompensate him for his misery. But there was the misery very plain.\r\nHe must give up his clubs, and his fashion, and all that he had\r\nhitherto gained, and be content to live a plain, humdrum, domestic\r\nlife, with eight hundred a year, and a small house, full of babies.\r\nIt was not the kind of Elysium for which he had tutored himself. Lily\r\nwas very nice, very nice indeed. She was, as he said to himself, "by\r\nodds, the nicest girl that he had ever seen." Whatever might now turn\r\nup, her happiness should be his first care. But as for his own,--he\r\nbegan to fear that the compensation would hardly be perfect. "It\r\nis my own doing," he said to himself, intending to be rather noble\r\nin the purport of his soliloquy, "I have trained myself for other\r\nthings,--very foolishly. Of course I must suffer,--suffer damnably.\r\nBut she shall never know it. Dear, sweet, innocent, pretty little\r\nthing!" And then he went on about the squire, as to whom he felt\r\nhimself entitled to be indignant by his own disinterested and manly\r\nline of conduct towards the niece. "But I will let him know what I\r\nthink about it," he said. "It\'s all very well for Dale to say that I\r\nhave been treated fairly. It isn\'t fair for a man to put forward his\r\nniece under false pretences. Of course I thought that he intended to\r\nprovide for her." And then, having made up his mind in a very manly\r\nway that he would not desert Lily altogether after having promised\r\nto marry her, he endeavoured to find consolation in the reflection\r\nthat he might, at any rate, allow himself two years\' more run as a\r\nbachelor in London. Girls who have to get themselves married without\r\nfortunes always know that they will have to wait. Indeed, Lily had\r\nalready told him, that as far as she was concerned, she was in\r\nno hurry. He need not, therefore, at once withdraw his name from\r\nSebright\'s. Thus he endeavoured to console himself, still, however,\r\nresolving that he would have a little serious conversation with the\r\nsquire that very evening as to Lily\'s fortune.\r\n\r\nAnd what was the state of Lily\'s mind at the same moment, while she,\r\nalso, was performing some slight toilet changes preparatory to their\r\nsimple dinner at the Small House?\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t behave well to him," she said to herself; "I never do.\r\nI forget how much he is giving up for me; and then, when anything\r\nannoys him, I make it worse instead of comforting him." And upon that\r\nshe made accusation against herself that she did not love him half\r\nenough,--that she did not let him see how thoroughly and perfectly\r\nshe loved him. She had an idea of her own, that as a girl should\r\nnever show any preference for a man till circumstances should have\r\nfully entitled him to such manifestation, so also should she make no\r\ndrawback on her love, but pour it forth for his benefit with all her\r\nstrength, when such circumstances had come to exist. But she was ever\r\nfeeling that she was not acting up to her theory, now that the time\r\nfor such practice had come. She would unwittingly assume little\r\nreserves, and make small pretences of indifference in spite of her\r\nown judgment. She had done so on this afternoon, and had left him\r\nwithout giving him her hand to press, without looking up into his\r\nface with an assurance of love, and therefore she was angry with\r\nherself. "I know I shall teach him to hate me," she said out loud to\r\nBell.\r\n\r\n"That would be very sad," said Bell; "but I don\'t see it."\r\n\r\n"If you were engaged to a man you would be much better to him. You\r\nwould not say so much, but what you did say would be all affection.\r\nI am always making horrid little speeches, for which I should like\r\nto cut out my tongue afterwards."\r\n\r\n"Whatever sort of speeches they are, I think that he likes them."\r\n\r\n"Does he? I\'m not all so sure of that, Bell. Of course I don\'t expect\r\nthat he is to scold me,--not yet, that is. But I know by his eye when\r\nhe is pleased and when he is displeased."\r\n\r\nAnd then they went down to their dinner.\r\n\r\nUp at the Great House the three gentlemen met together in apparent\r\ngood humour. Bernard Dale was a man of an equal temperament, who\r\nrarely allowed any feeling, or even any annoyance, to interfere\r\nwith his usual manner,--a man who could always come to table with\r\na smile, and meet either his friend or his enemy with a properly\r\ncivil greeting. Not that he was especially a false man. There was\r\nnothing of deceit in his placidity of demeanour. It arose from true\r\nequanimity; but it was the equanimity of a cold disposition rather\r\nthan of one well ordered by discipline. The squire was aware that\r\nhe had been unreasonably petulant before dinner, and having taken\r\nhimself to task in his own way, now entered the dining-room with the\r\ncourteous greeting of a host. "I find that your bag was not so bad\r\nafter all," he said, "and I hope that your appetite is at least as\r\ngood as your bag."\r\n\r\nCrosbie smiled, and made himself pleasant, and said a few flattering\r\nwords. A man who intends to take some very decided step in an hour or\r\ntwo generally contrives to bear himself in the meantime as though the\r\ntrifles of the world were quite sufficient for him. So he praised the\r\nsquire\'s game; said a good-natured word as to Dingles, and bantered\r\nhimself as to his own want of skill. Then all went merry,--not quite\r\nas a marriage bell; but still merry enough for a party of three\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\nBut Crosbie\'s resolution was fixed; and as soon, therefore, as the\r\nold butler was permanently gone, and the wine steadily in transit\r\nupon the table, he began his task, not without some apparent\r\nabruptness. Having fully considered the matter, he had determined\r\nthat he would not wait for Bernard Dale\'s absence. He thought\r\nit possible that he might be able to fight his battle better in\r\nBernard\'s presence than he could do behind his back.\r\n\r\n"Squire," he began. They all called him squire when they were on good\r\nterms together, and Crosbie thought it well to begin as though there\r\nwas nothing amiss between them. "Squire, of course I am thinking a\r\ngood deal at the present moment as to my intended marriage."\r\n\r\n"That\'s natural enough," said the squire.\r\n\r\n"Yes, by George! sir, a man doesn\'t make a change like that without\r\nfinding that he has got something to think of."\r\n\r\n"I suppose not," said the squire. "I never was in the way of getting\r\nmarried myself, but I can easily understand that."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been the luckiest fellow in the world in finding such a girl as\r\nyour niece--" Whereupon the squire bowed, intending to make a little\r\ncourteous declaration that the luck in the matter was on the side\r\nof the Dales. "I know that," continued Crosbie. "She is exactly\r\neverything that a girl ought to be."\r\n\r\n"She is a good girl," said Bernard.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I think she is," said the squire.\r\n\r\n"But it seems to me," said Crosbie, finding that it was necessary to\r\ndash at once headlong into the water, "that something ought to be\r\nsaid as to my means of supporting her properly."\r\n\r\nThen he paused for a moment, expecting that the squire would speak.\r\nBut the squire sat perfectly still, looking intently at the empty\r\nfireplace and saying nothing. "Of supporting her," continued Crosbie,\r\n"with all those comforts to which she has been accustomed."\r\n\r\n"She has never been used to expense," said the squire. "Her mother,\r\nas you doubtless know, is not a rich woman."\r\n\r\n"But living here, Lily has had great advantages,--a horse to ride,\r\nand all that sort of thing."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose she expects a horse in the park," said the squire,\r\nwith a very perceptible touch of sarcasm in his voice.\r\n\r\n"I hope not," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"I believe she has had the use of one of the ponies here sometimes,\r\nbut I hope that has not made her extravagant in her ideas. I did not\r\nthink that there was anything of that nonsense about either of them."\r\n\r\n"Nor is there,--as far as I know."\r\n\r\n"Nothing of the sort," said Bernard.\r\n\r\n"But the long and the short of it is this, sir!" and Crosbie, as he\r\nspoke, endeavoured to maintain his ordinary voice and usual coolness,\r\nbut his heightened colour betrayed that he was nervous. "Am I to\r\nexpect any accession of income with my wife?"\r\n\r\n"I have not spoken to my sister-in-law on the subject," said the\r\nsquire; "but I should fear that she cannot do much."\r\n\r\n"As a matter of course, I would not take a shilling from her," said\r\nCrosbie.\r\n\r\n"Then that settles it," said the squire.\r\n\r\nCrosbie paused a moment, during which his colour became very red. He\r\nunconsciously took up an apricot and eat it, and then he spoke out.\r\n"Of course I was not alluding to Mrs. Dale\'s income; I would not, on\r\nany account, disturb her arrangements. But I wished to learn, sir,\r\nwhether you intend to do anything for your niece."\r\n\r\n"In the way of giving her a fortune? Nothing at all. I intend to do\r\nnothing at all."\r\n\r\n"Then I suppose we understand each other,--at last," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"I should have thought that we might have understood each other at\r\nfirst," said the squire. "Did I ever make you any promise, or give\r\nyou any hint that I intended to provide for my niece? Have I ever\r\nheld out to you any such hope? I don\'t know what you mean by that\r\nword \'at last\'--unless it be to give offence."\r\n\r\n"I meant the truth, sir;--I meant this--that seeing the manner in\r\nwhich your nieces lived with you, I thought it probable that you\r\nwould treat them both as though they were your daughters. Now I find\r\nout my mistake;--that is all!"\r\n\r\n"You have been mistaken,--and without a shadow of excuse for your\r\nmistake."\r\n\r\n"Others have been mistaken with me," said Crosbie, forgetting, on the\r\nspur of the moment, that he had no right to drag the opinion of any\r\nother person into the question.\r\n\r\n"What others?" said the squire, with anger; and his mind immediately\r\nbetook itself to his sister-in-law.\r\n\r\n"I do not want to make any mischief," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"If anybody connected with my family has presumed to tell you that\r\nI intended to do more for my niece Lilian than I have already done,\r\nsuch person has not only been false, but ungrateful. I have given to\r\nno one any authority to make any promise on behalf of my niece."\r\n\r\n"No such promise has been made. It was only a suggestion," said\r\nCrosbie.\r\n\r\nHe was not in the least aware to whom the squire was alluding in his\r\nanger; but he perceived that his host was angry, and having already\r\nreflected that he should not have alluded to the words which Bernard\r\nDale had spoken in his friendship, he resolved to name no one.\r\nBernard, as he sat by listening, knew exactly how the matter stood;\r\nbut, as he thought, there could be no reason why he should subject\r\nhimself to his uncle\'s ill-will, seeing that he had committed no sin.\r\n\r\n"No such suggestion should have been made," said the squire. "No one\r\nhas had a right to make such a suggestion. No one has been placed by\r\nme in a position to make such a suggestion to you without manifest\r\nimpropriety. I will ask no further questions about it; but it is\r\nquite as well that you should understand at once that I do not\r\nconsider it to be my duty to give my niece Lilian a fortune on her\r\nmarriage. I trust that your offer to her was not made under any such\r\ndelusion."\r\n\r\n"No, sir; it was not," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"Then I suppose that no great harm has been done. I am sorry if false\r\nhopes have been given to you; but I am sure you will acknowledge that\r\nthey were not given to you by me."\r\n\r\n"I think you have misunderstood me, sir. My hopes were never very\r\nhigh; but I thought it right to ascertain your intentions."\r\n\r\n"Now you know them. I trust, for the girl\'s sake, that it will make\r\nno difference to her. I can hardly believe that she has been to blame\r\nin the matter."\r\n\r\nCrosbie hastened at once to exculpate Lily; and then, with more\r\nawkward blunders than a man should have made who was so well\r\nacquainted with fashionable life as the Apollo of the Beaufort, he\r\nproceeded to explain that, as Lily was to have nothing, his own\r\npecuniary arrangements would necessitate some little delay in their\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n"As far as I myself am concerned," said the squire, "I do not like\r\nlong engagements. But I am quite aware that in this matter I have no\r\nright to interfere, unless, indeed--" and then he stopped himself.\r\n\r\n"I suppose it will be well to fix some day; eh, Crosbie?" said\r\nBernard.\r\n\r\n"I will discuss that matter with Mrs. Dale," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"If you and she understand each other," said the squire, "that will\r\nbe sufficient. Shall we go into the drawing-room now, or out upon the\r\nlawn?"\r\n\r\nThat evening, as Crosbie went to bed, he felt that he had not gained\r\nthe victory in his encounter with the squire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nIT CANNOT BE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning at breakfast each of the three gentlemen\r\nat the Great House received a little note on pink paper, nominally\r\nfrom Mrs. Dale, asking them to drink tea at the Small House on that\r\nday week. At the bottom of the note which Lily had written for Mr.\r\nCrosbie was added: "Dancing on the lawn, if we can get anybody to\r\nstand up. Of course you must come, whether you like it or not. And\r\nBernard also. Do your possible to talk my uncle into coming." And\r\nthis note did something towards re-creating good-humour among them\r\nat the breakfast-table. It was shown to the squire, and at last he\r\nwas brought to say that he would perhaps go to Mrs. Dale\'s little\r\nevening-party.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to explain that this promised entertainment had been\r\noriginated with no special view to the pleasure of Mr. Crosbie, but\r\naltogether on behalf of poor Johnny Eames. What was to be done in\r\nthat matter? This question had been fully discussed between Mrs. Dale\r\nand Bell, and they had come to the conclusion that it would be best\r\nto ask Johnny over to a little friendly gathering, in which he might\r\nbe able to meet Lily with some strangers around them. In this way\r\nhis embarrassment might be overcome. It would never do, as Mrs. Dale\r\nsaid, that he should be suffered to stay away, unnoticed by them.\r\n"When the ice is once broken he won\'t mind it," said Bell. And,\r\ntherefore, early in the day, a messenger was sent over to Guestwick,\r\nwho returned with a note from Mrs. Eames, saying that she would come\r\non the evening in question, with her son and daughter. They would\r\nkeep the fly and get back to Guestwick the same evening. This was\r\nadded, as an offer had been made of beds for Mrs. Eames and Mary.\r\n\r\nBefore the evening of the party another memorable occurrence had\r\ntaken place at Allington, which must be described, in order that the\r\nfeelings of the different people on that evening may be understood.\r\nThe squire had given his nephew to understand that he wished to have\r\nthat matter settled as to his niece Bell; and as Bernard\'s views were\r\naltogether in accordance with the squire\'s, he resolved to comply\r\nwith his uncle\'s wishes. The project with him was not a new thing. He\r\ndid love his cousin quite sufficiently for purposes of matrimony, and\r\nwas minded that it would be a good thing for him to marry. He could\r\nnot marry without money, but this marriage would give him an income\r\nwithout the trouble of intricate settlements, or the interference of\r\nlawyers hostile to his own interests. It was possible that he might\r\ndo better; but then it was possible also that he might do much worse;\r\nand, in addition to this, he was fond of his cousin. He discussed the\r\nmatter within himself, very calmly; made some excellent resolutions\r\nas to the kind of life which it would behove him to live as a married\r\nman; settled on the street in London in which he would have his\r\nhouse, and behaved very prettily to Bell for four or five days\r\nrunning. That he did not make love to her, in the ordinary sense of\r\nthe word, must, I suppose, be taken for granted, seeing that Bell\r\nherself did not recognize the fact. She had always liked her cousin,\r\nand thought that in these days he was making himself particularly\r\nagreeable.\r\n\r\nOn the evening before the party the girls were at the Great House,\r\nhaving come up nominally with the intention of discussing the\r\nexpediency of dancing on the lawn. Lily had made up her mind that it\r\nwas to be so, but Bell had objected that it would be cold and damp,\r\nand that the drawing-room would be nicer for dancing.\r\n\r\n"You see we\'ve only got four young gentlemen and one ungrown," said\r\nLily; "and they will look so stupid standing up all properly in a\r\nroom, as though we had a regular party."\r\n\r\n"Thank you for the compliment," said Crosbie, taking off his straw\r\nhat.\r\n\r\n"So you will; and we girls will look more stupid still. But out on\r\nthe lawn it won\'t look stupid at all. Two or three might stand up on\r\nthe lawn, and it would be jolly enough."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t quite see it," said Bernard.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think I see it," said Crosbie. "The unadaptability of the\r\nlawn for the purpose of a ball--"\r\n\r\n"Nobody is thinking of a ball," said Lily, with mock petulance.\r\n\r\n"I\'m defending you, and yet you won\'t let me speak. The\r\nunadaptability of the lawn for the purposes of a ball will conceal\r\nthe insufficiency of four men and a boy as a supply of male dancers.\r\nBut, Lily, who is the ungrown gentleman? Is it your old friend Johnny\r\nEames?"\r\n\r\nLily\'s voice became sobered as she answered him.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; I did not mean Mr. Eames. He is coming, but I did not mean\r\nhim. Dick Boyce, Mr. Boyce\'s son, is only sixteen. He is the ungrown\r\ngentleman."\r\n\r\n"And who is the fourth adult?"\r\n\r\n"Dr. Crofts, from Guestwick. I do hope you will like him, Adolphus.\r\nWe think he is the very perfection of a man."\r\n\r\n"Then of course I shall hate him; and be very jealous, too!"\r\n\r\nAnd then that pair went off together, fighting their own little\r\nbattle on that head, as turtle-doves will sometimes do. They went\r\noff, and Bernard was left with Bell standing together over the ha-ha\r\nfence which divides the garden at the back of the house from the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n"Bell," he said, "they seem very happy, don\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"And they ought to be happy now, oughtn\'t they? Dear Lily! I hope he\r\nwill be good to her. Do you know, Bernard, though he is your friend,\r\nI am very, very anxious about it. It is such a vast trust to put in a\r\nman when we do not quite know him."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is; but they\'ll do very well together. Lily will be happy\r\nenough."\r\n\r\n"And he?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose he\'ll be happy, too. He\'ll feel himself a little\r\nstraightened as to income at first, but that will all come round."\r\n\r\n"If he is not, she will be wretched."\r\n\r\n"They will do very well. Lily must be prepared to make the money go\r\nas far as she can, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Lily won\'t feel the want of money. It is not that. But if he lets\r\nher know that she has made him a poor man, then she will be unhappy.\r\nIs he extravagant, Bernard?"\r\n\r\nBut Bernard was anxious to discuss another subject, and therefore\r\nwould not speak such words of wisdom as to Lily\'s engagement as might\r\nhave been expected from him had he been in a different frame of mind.\r\n\r\n"No, I should say not," said he. "But, Bell--"\r\n\r\n"I do not know that we could have acted otherwise than we have done,\r\nand yet I fear that we have been rash. If he makes her unhappy,\r\nBernard, I shall never forgive you."\r\n\r\nBut as she said this she put her hand lovingly upon his arm, as a\r\ncousin might do, and spoke in a tone which divested her threat of its\r\nacerbity.\r\n\r\n"You must not quarrel with me, Bell, whatever may happen. I cannot\r\nafford to quarrel with you."\r\n\r\n"Of course I was not in earnest as to that."\r\n\r\n"You and I must never quarrel, Bell; at least, I hope not. I could\r\nbear to quarrel with any one rather than with you." And then, as he\r\nspoke, there was something in his voice which gave the girl some\r\nslight, indistinct warning of what might be his intention. Not\r\nthat she said to herself at once, that he was going to make her an\r\noffer of his hand,--now, on the spot; but she felt that he intended\r\nsomething beyond the tenderness of ordinary cousinly affection.\r\n\r\n"I hope we shall never quarrel," she said. But as she spoke, her\r\nmind was settling itself,--forming its resolution, and coming to\r\na conclusion as to the sort of love which Bernard might, perhaps,\r\nexpect. And it formed another conclusion; as to the sort of love\r\nwhich might be given in return.\r\n\r\n"Bell," he said, "you and I have always been dear friends."\r\n\r\n"Yes; always."\r\n\r\n"Why should we not be something more than friends?"\r\n\r\nTo give Captain Dale his due I must declare that his voice was\r\nperfectly natural as he asked this question, and that he showed no\r\nsigns of nervousness, either in his face or limbs. He had made up his\r\nmind to do it on that occasion, and he did it without any signs of\r\noutward disturbance. He asked his question, and then he waited for\r\nhis answer. In this he was rather hard upon his cousin; for, though\r\nthe question had certainly been asked in language that could not be\r\nmistaken, still the matter had not been put forward with all that\r\nfulness which a young lady, under such circumstances, has a right to\r\nexpect.\r\n\r\nThey had sat down on the turf close to the ha-ha, and they were so\r\nnear that Bernard was able to put out his hand with the view of\r\ntaking that of his cousin within his own. But she contrived to keep\r\nher hands locked together, so that he merely held her gently by the\r\nwrist.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t quite understand, Bernard," she said, after a minute\'s\r\npause.\r\n\r\n"Shall we be more than cousins? Shall we be man and wife?"\r\n\r\nNow, at least, she could not say that she did not understand. If the\r\nquestion was ever asked plainly, Bernard Dale had asked it plainly.\r\nShall we be man and wife? Few men, I fancy, dare to put it all at\r\nonce in so abrupt a way, and yet I do not know that the English\r\nlanguage affords any better terms for the question.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Bernard! you have surprised me."\r\n\r\n"I hope I have not pained you, Bell. I have been long thinking of\r\nthis, but I am well aware that my own manner, even to you, has not\r\nbeen that of a lover. It is not in me to smile and say soft things,\r\nas Crosbie can. But I do not love you the less on that account. I\r\nhave looked about for a wife, and I have thought that if I could gain\r\nyou I should be very fortunate."\r\n\r\nHe did not then say anything about his uncle, and the eight hundred a\r\nyear; but he fully intended to do so as soon as an opportunity should\r\nserve. He was quite of opinion that eight hundred a year and the\r\ngood-will of a rich uncle were strong grounds for matrimony,--were\r\ngrounds even for love; and he did not doubt but his cousin would see\r\nthe matter in the same light.\r\n\r\n"You are very good to me--more than good. Of course I know that. But,\r\noh, Bernard! I did not expect this a bit."\r\n\r\n"But you will answer me, Bell! Or if you would like time to think, or\r\nto speak to my aunt, perhaps you will answer me to-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"I think I ought to answer you now."\r\n\r\n"Not if it be a refusal, Bell. Think well of it before you do that.\r\nI should have told you that our uncle wishes this match, and that he\r\nwill remove any difficulty there might be about money."\r\n\r\n"I do not care for money."\r\n\r\n"But, as you were saying about Lily, one has to be prudent. Now, in\r\nour marriage, everything of that kind would be well arranged. My\r\nuncle has promised me that he would at once allow us--"\r\n\r\n"Stop, Bernard. You must not be led to suppose that any offer made by\r\nmy uncle would help to purchase-- Indeed, there can be no need for us\r\nto talk about money."\r\n\r\n"I wished to let you know the facts of the case, exactly as they are.\r\nAnd as to our uncle, I cannot but think that you would be glad, in\r\nsuch a matter, to have him on your side."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I should be glad to have him on my side; that is, if I were\r\ngoing-- But my uncle\'s wishes could not influence my decision. The\r\nfact is, Bernard--"\r\n\r\n"Well, dearest, what is the fact?"\r\n\r\n"I have always regarded you rather as a brother than as anything\r\nelse."\r\n\r\n"But that regard may be changed."\r\n\r\n"No; I think not. Bernard, I will go further and speak on at once.\r\nIt cannot be changed. I know myself well enough to say that with\r\ncertainty. It cannot be changed."\r\n\r\n"You mean that you cannot love me?"\r\n\r\n"Not as you would have me do. I do love you very dearly,--very\r\ndearly, indeed. I would go to you in any trouble, exactly as I would\r\ngo to a brother."\r\n\r\n"And must that be all, Bell?"\r\n\r\n"Is not that all the sweetest love that can be felt? But you must\r\nnot think me ungrateful, or proud. I know well that you are--are\r\nproposing to do for me much more than I deserve. Any girl might be\r\nproud of such an offer. But, dear Bernard--"\r\n\r\n"Bell, before you give me a final answer, sleep upon this and talk it\r\nover with your mother. Of course you were unprepared, and I cannot\r\nexpect that you should promise me so much without a moment\'s\r\nconsideration."\r\n\r\n"I was unprepared, and therefore I have not answered you as I should\r\nhave done. But as it has gone so far, I cannot let you leave me in\r\nuncertainty. It is not necessary that I should keep you waiting. In\r\nthis matter I do know my own mind. Dear Bernard, indeed, indeed it\r\ncannot be as you have proposed."\r\n\r\nShe spoke in a low voice, and in a tone that had in it something of\r\nalmost imploring humility; but, nevertheless, it conveyed to her\r\ncousin an assurance that she was in earnest; an assurance also that\r\nthat earnest would not readily be changed. Was she not a Dale? And\r\nwhen did a Dale change his mind? For a while he sat silent by her;\r\nand she too, having declared her intention, refrained from further\r\nwords. For some minutes they thus remained, looking down into the\r\nha-ha. She still kept her old position, holding her hands clasped\r\ntogether over her knees; but he was now lying on his side, supporting\r\nhis head upon his arm, with his face indeed turned towards her, but\r\nwith his eyes fixed upon the grass. During this time, however, he was\r\nnot idle. His cousin\'s answer, though it had grieved him, had not\r\ncome upon him as a blow stunning him for a moment, and rendering him\r\nunfit for instant thought. He was grieved, more grieved than he had\r\nthought he would have been. The thing that he had wanted moderately,\r\nhe now wanted the more in that it was denied to him. But he was able\r\nto perceive the exact truth of his position, and to calculate what\r\nmight be his chances if he went on with his suit, and what his\r\nadvantage if he at once abandoned it.\r\n\r\n"I do not wish to press you unfairly, Bell; but may I ask if any\r\nother preference--"\r\n\r\n"There is no other preference," she answered. And then again they\r\nwere silent for a minute or two.\r\n\r\n"My uncle will be much grieved at this," he said at last.\r\n\r\n"If that be all," said Bell, "I do not think that we need either of\r\nus trouble ourselves. He can have no right to dispose of our hearts."\r\n\r\n"I understand the taunt, Bell."\r\n\r\n"Dear Bernard, there was no taunt. I intended none."\r\n\r\n"I need not speak of my own grief. You cannot but know how deep it\r\nmust be. Why should I have submitted myself to this mortification had\r\nnot my heart been concerned? But that I will bear, if I must bear\r\nit--" And then he paused, looking up at her.\r\n\r\n"It will soon pass away," she said.\r\n\r\n"I will accept it at any rate without complaint. But as to my uncle\'s\r\nfeelings, it is open to me to speak, and to you, I should think, to\r\nlisten without indifference. He has been kind to us both, and loves\r\nus two above any other living beings. It\'s not surprising that he\r\nshould wish to see us married, and it will not be surprising if your\r\nrefusal should be a great blow to him."\r\n\r\n"I shall be sorry--very sorry."\r\n\r\n"I also shall be sorry. I am now speaking of him. He has set his\r\nheart upon it; and as he has but few wishes, few desires, so is he\r\nthe more constant in those which he expresses. When he knows this,\r\nI fear that we shall find him very stern."\r\n\r\n"Then he will be unjust."\r\n\r\n"No; he will not be unjust. He is always a just man. But he will\r\nbe unhappy, and will, I fear, make others unhappy. Dear Bell, may\r\nnot this thing remain for a while unsettled? You will not find that\r\nI take advantage of your goodness. I will not intrude it on you\r\nagain,--say for a fortnight,--or till Crosbie shall be gone."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"Why are you so eager in your noes? There can be no danger in such\r\ndelay. I will not press you,--and you can let my uncle think that you\r\nhave at least taken time for consideration."\r\n\r\n"There are things as to which one is bound to answer at once. If\r\nI doubted myself, I would let you persuade me. But I do not doubt\r\nmyself, and I should be wrong to keep you in suspense. Dear, dearest\r\nBernard, it cannot be; and as it cannot be, you, as my brother, would\r\nbid me say so clearly. It cannot be."\r\n\r\nAs she made this last assurance, they heard the steps of Lily and her\r\nlover close to them, and they both felt that it would be well that\r\ntheir intercourse should thus be brought to a close. Neither had\r\nknown how to get up and leave the place, and yet each had felt that\r\nnothing further could then be said.\r\n\r\n"Did you ever see anything so sweet and affectionate and romantic?"\r\nsaid Lily, standing over them and looking at them. "And all the\r\nwhile we have been so practical and worldly. Do you know, Bell, that\r\nAdolphus seems to think we can\'t very well keep pigs in London. It\r\nmakes me so unhappy."\r\n\r\n"It does seem a pity," said Crosbie, "for Lily seems to know all\r\nabout pigs."\r\n\r\n"Of course I do. I haven\'t lived in the country all my life for\r\nnothing. Oh, Bernard, I should so like to see you rolled down into\r\nthe bottom of the ha-ha. Just remain there, and we\'ll do it between\r\nus."\r\n\r\nWhereupon Bernard got up, as did Bell also, and they all went in to\r\ntea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nMRS. DALE\'S LITTLE PARTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day was the day of the party. Not a word more was said on\r\nthat evening between Bell and her cousin, at least, not a word more\r\nof any peculiar note; and when Crosbie suggested to his friend on the\r\nfollowing morning that they should both step down and see how the\r\npreparations were getting on at the Small House, Bernard declined.\r\n\r\n"You forget, my dear fellow, that I\'m not in love as you are," said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n"But I thought you were," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"No; not at all as you are. You are an accepted lover, and will be\r\nallowed to do anything,--whip the creams, and tune the piano, if\r\nyou know how. I\'m only a half sort of lover, meditating a mariage\r\nde convenance to oblige an uncle, and by no means required by the\r\nterms of my agreement to undergo a very rigid amount of drill. Your\r\nposition is just the reverse." In saying all which Captain Dale was\r\nno doubt very false; but if falseness can be forgiven to a man in any\r\nposition, it may be forgiven in that which he then filled. So Crosbie\r\nwent down to the Small House alone.\r\n\r\n"Dale wouldn\'t come," said he, speaking to the three ladies together,\r\n"I suppose he\'s keeping himself up for the dance on the lawn."\r\n\r\n"I hope he will be here in the evening," said Mrs. Dale. But Bell\r\nsaid never a word. She had determined, that under the existing\r\ncircumstances, it would be only fair to her cousin that his offer\r\nand her answer to it should be kept secret. She knew why Bernard\r\ndid not come across from the Great House with his friend, but she\r\nsaid nothing of her knowledge. Lily looked at her, but looked\r\nwithout speaking; and as for Mrs. Dale, she took no notice of the\r\ncircumstance. Thus they passed the afternoon together without further\r\nmention of Bernard Dale; and it may be said, at any rate of Lily and\r\nCrosbie, that his presence was not missed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eames, with her son and daughter, were the first to come. "It is\r\nso nice of you to come early," said Lily, trying on the spur of the\r\nmoment to say something which should sound pleasant and happy, but in\r\ntruth using that form of welcome which to my ears sounds always the\r\nmost ungracious. "Ten minutes before the time named; and, of course,\r\nyou must have understood that I meant thirty minutes after it!" That\r\nis my interpretation of the words when I am thanked for coming early.\r\nBut Mrs. Eames was a kind, patient, unexacting woman, who took all\r\ncivil words as meaning civility. And, indeed, Lily had meant nothing\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n"Yes; we did come early," said Mrs. Eames, "because Mary thought she\r\nwould like to go up into the girls\' room and just settle her hair,\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\n"So she shall," said Lily, who had taken Mary by the hand.\r\n\r\n"And we knew we shouldn\'t be in the way. Johnny can go out into the\r\ngarden if there\'s anything left to be done."\r\n\r\n"He shan\'t be banished unless he likes it," said Mrs. Dale. "If he\r\nfinds us women too much for his unaided strength--"\r\n\r\nJohn Eames muttered something about being very well as he was, and\r\nthen got himself into an arm-chair. He had shaken hands with Lily,\r\ntrying as he did so to pronounce articulately a little speech which\r\nhe had prepared for the occasion. "I have to congratulate you, Lily,\r\nand I hope with all my heart that you will be happy." The words were\r\nsimple enough, and were not ill-chosen, but the poor young man never\r\ngot them spoken. The word "congratulate" did reach Lily\'s ears, and\r\nshe understood it all;--both the kindness of the intended speech and\r\nthe reason why it could not be spoken.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, John," she said; "I hope I shall see so much of you in\r\nLondon. It will be so nice to have an old Guestwick friend near me."\r\nShe had her own voice, and the pulses of her heart better under\r\ncommand than had he; but she also felt that the occasion was trying\r\nto her. The man had loved her honestly and truly,--still did love\r\nher, paying her the great homage of bitter grief in that he had lost\r\nher. Where is the girl who will not sympathize with such love and\r\nsuch grief, if it be shown only because it cannot be concealed, and\r\nbe declared against the will of him who declares it?\r\n\r\nThen came in old Mrs. Hearn, whose cottage was not distant two\r\nminutes\' walk from the Small House. She always called Mrs. Dale "my\r\ndear," and petted the girls as though they had been children. When\r\ntold of Lily\'s marriage, she had thrown up her hands with surprise,\r\nfor she had still left in some corner of her drawers remnants of\r\nsugar-plums which she had bought for Lily. "A London man is he? Well,\r\nwell. I wish he lived in the country. Eight hundred a year, my dear?"\r\nshe had said to Mrs. Dale. "That sounds nice down here, because we\r\nare all so poor. But I suppose eight hundred a year isn\'t very much\r\nup in London?"\r\n\r\n"The squire\'s coming, I suppose, isn\'t he?" said Mrs. Hearn, as she\r\nseated herself on the sofa close to Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he\'ll be here by-and-by; unless he changes his mind, you know.\r\nHe doesn\'t stand on ceremony with me."\r\n\r\n"He change his mind! When did you ever know Christopher Dale change\r\nhis mind?"\r\n\r\n"He is pretty constant, Mrs. Hearn."\r\n\r\n"If he promised to give a man a penny, he\'d give it. But if he\r\npromised to take away a pound, he\'d take it, though it cost him years\r\nto get it. He\'s going to turn me out of my cottage, he says."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Mrs. Hearn!"\r\n\r\n"Jolliffe came and told me"--Jolliffe, I should explain, was the\r\nbailiff,--"that if I didn\'t like it as it was, I might leave it, and\r\nthat the squire could get double the rent for it. Now all I asked was\r\nthat he should do a little painting in the kitchen; and the wood is\r\nall as black as his hat."\r\n\r\n"I thought it was understood you were to paint inside."\r\n\r\n"How can I do it, my dear, with a hundred and forty pounds for\r\neverything? I must live, you know! And he that has workmen about him\r\nevery day of the year! And was that a message to send to me, who have\r\nlived in the parish for fifty years? Here he is." And Mrs. Hearn\r\nmajestically raised herself from her seat as the squire entered the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nWith him entered Mr. and Mrs. Boyce, from the parsonage, with Dick\r\nBoyce, the ungrown gentleman, and two girl Boyces, who were fourteen\r\nand fifteen years of age. Mrs. Dale, with the amount of good-nature\r\nusual on such occasions, asked reproachfully why Jane, and Charles,\r\nand Florence, and Bessy, did not come,--Boyce being a man who had\r\nhis quiver full of them,--and Mrs. Boyce, giving the usual answer,\r\ndeclared that she already felt that they had come as an avalanche.\r\n\r\n"But where are the--the--the young men?" asked Lily, assuming a look\r\nof mock astonishment.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll be across in two or three hours\' time," said the squire.\r\n"They both dressed for dinner, and, as I thought, made themselves\r\nvery smart; but for such a grand occasion as this they thought a\r\nsecond dressing necessary. How do you do, Mrs. Hearn? I hope you\r\nare quite well. No rheumatism left, eh?" This the squire said very\r\nloud into Mrs. Hearn\'s ear. Mrs. Hearn was perhaps a little hard of\r\nhearing; but it was very little, and she hated to be thought deaf.\r\nShe did not, moreover, like to be thought rheumatic. This the squire\r\nknew, and therefore his mode of address was not good-natured.\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t make me jump so, Mr. Dale. I\'m pretty well now, thank\r\nye. I did have a twinge in the spring,--that cottage is so badly\r\nbuilt for draughts! \'I wonder you can live in it,\' my sister said to\r\nme the last time she was over. I suppose I should be better off over\r\nwith her at Hamersham, only one doesn\'t like to move, you know, after\r\nliving fifty years in one parish."\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t think of going away from us," Mrs. Boyce said, speaking\r\nby no means loud, but slowly and plainly, hoping thereby to flatter\r\nthe old woman. But the old woman understood it all. "She\'s a sly\r\ncreature, is Mrs. Boyce," Mrs. Hearn said to Mrs. Dale, before the\r\nevening was out. There are some old people whom it is very hard to\r\nflatter, and with whom it is, nevertheless, almost impossible to live\r\nunless you do flatter them.\r\n\r\nAt last the two heroes came in across the lawn at the drawing-room\r\nwindow; and Lily, as they entered, dropped a low curtsey before them,\r\ngently swelling down upon the ground with her light muslin dress,\r\ntill she looked like some wondrous flower that had bloomed upon the\r\ncarpet, and putting her two hands, with the backs of her fingers\r\npressed together, on the buckle of her girdle, she said, "We are\r\nwaiting upon your honours\' kind grace, and feel how much we owe to\r\nyou for favouring our poor abode." And then she gently rose up again,\r\nsmiling, oh, so sweetly, on the man she loved, and the puffings and\r\nswellings went out of her muslin.\r\n\r\nI think there is nothing in the world so pretty as the conscious\r\nlittle tricks of love played off by a girl towards the man she loves,\r\nwhen she has made up her mind boldly that all the world may know that\r\nshe has given herself away to him.\r\n\r\nI am not sure that Crosbie liked it all as much as he should have\r\ndone. The bold assurance of her love when they two were alone\r\ntogether he did like. What man does not like such assurances on such\r\noccasions? But perhaps he would have been better pleased had Lily\r\nshown more reticence,--been more secret, as it were, as to her\r\nfeelings, when others were around them. It was not that he accused\r\nher in his thoughts of any want of delicacy. He read her character\r\ntoo well;--was, if not quite aright in his reading of it, at least\r\ntoo nearly so to admit of his making against her any such accusation\r\nas that. It was the calf-like feeling that was disagreeable to him.\r\nHe did not like to be presented, even to the world of Allington, as\r\na victim caught for the sacrifice, and bound with ribbon for the\r\naltar. And then there lurked behind it all a feeling that it might be\r\nsafer that the thing should not be so openly manifested before all\r\nthe world. Of course, everybody knew that he was engaged to Lily\r\nDale; nor had he, as he said to himself, perhaps too frequently,\r\nthe slightest idea of breaking from that engagement. But then the\r\nmarriage might possibly be delayed. He had not discussed that matter\r\nyet with Lily, having, indeed, at the first moment of his gratified\r\nlove, created some little difficulty for himself by pressing for an\r\nearly day. "I will refuse you nothing," she had said to him; "but\r\ndo not make it too soon." He saw, therefore, before him some little\r\nembarrassment, and was inclined to wish that Lily would abstain from\r\nthat manner which seemed to declare to all the world that she was\r\nabout to be married immediately. "I must speak to her to-morrow," he\r\nsaid to himself, as he accepted her salute with a mock gravity equal\r\nto her own.\r\n\r\nPoor Lily! How little she understood as yet what was passing through\r\nhis mind. Had she known his wish she would have wrapped up her love\r\ncarefully in a napkin, so that no one should have seen it,--no one\r\nbut he, when he might choose to have the treasure uncovered for his\r\nsight. And it was all for his sake that she had been thus open in her\r\nways. She had seen girls who were half ashamed of their love; but she\r\nwould never be ashamed of hers or of him. She had given herself to\r\nhim; and now all the world might know it, if all the world cared\r\nfor such knowledge. Why should she be ashamed of that which, to her\r\nthinking, was so great an honour to her? She had heard of girls who\r\nwould not speak of their love, arguing to themselves cannily that\r\nthere may be many a slip between the cup and the lip. There could be\r\nno need of any such caution with her. There could surely be no such\r\nslip! Should there be such a fall,--should any such fate, either by\r\nfalseness or misfortune, come upon her,--no such caution could be of\r\nservice to save her. The cup would have been so shattered in its fall\r\nthat no further piecing of its parts would be in any way possible. So\r\nmuch as this she did not exactly say to herself; but she felt it all,\r\nand went bravely forward,--bold in her love, and careful to hide it\r\nfrom none who chanced to see it.\r\n\r\nThey had gone through the ceremony with the cake and teacups, and had\r\ndecided that, at any rate, the first dance or two should be held upon\r\nthe lawn when the last of the guests arrived.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Adolphus, I am so glad he has come," said Lily. "Do try to like\r\nhim." Of Dr. Crofts, who was the new comer, she had sometimes spoken\r\nto her lover, but she had never coupled her sister\'s name with that\r\nof the doctor, even in speaking to him. Nevertheless, Crosbie had in\r\nsome way conceived the idea that this Crofts either had been, or was,\r\nor was to be, in love with Bell; and as he was prepared to advocate\r\nhis friend Dale\'s claims in that quarter, he was not particularly\r\nanxious to welcome the doctor as a thoroughly intimate friend of the\r\nfamily. He knew nothing as yet of Dale\'s offer, or of Bell\'s refusal,\r\nbut he was prepared for war, if war should be necessary. Of the\r\nsquire, at the present moment, he was not very fond; but if his\r\ndestiny intended to give him a wife out of this family, he should\r\nprefer the owner of Allington and nephew of Lord De Guest as a\r\nbrother-in-law to a village doctor,--as he took upon himself, in his\r\npride, to call Dr. Crofts.\r\n\r\n"It is very unfortunate," said he, "but I never do like Paragons."\r\n\r\n"But you must like this Paragon. Not that he is a Paragon at all, for\r\nhe smokes and hunts, and does all manner of wicked things." And then\r\nshe went forward to welcome her friend.\r\n\r\nDr. Crofts was a slight, spare man, about five feet nine in height,\r\nwith very bright dark eyes, a broad forehead, with dark hair that\r\nalmost curled, but which did not come so forward over his brow as it\r\nshould have done for purposes of beauty,--with a thin well-cut nose,\r\nand a mouth that would have been perfect had the lips been a little\r\nfuller. The lower part of his face, when seen alone, had in it\r\nsomewhat of sternness, which, however, was redeemed by the brightness\r\nof his eyes. And yet an artist would have declared that the lower\r\nfeatures of his face were by far the more handsome.\r\n\r\nLily went across to him and greeted him heartily, declaring how glad\r\nshe was to have him there. "And I must introduce you to Mr. Crosbie,"\r\nshe said, as though she was determined to carry her point. The two\r\nmen shook hands with each other, coldly, without saying a word, as\r\nyoung men are apt to do when they are brought together in that way.\r\nThen they separated at once, somewhat to the disappointment of Lily.\r\nCrosbie stood off by himself, both his eyes turned up towards the\r\nceiling, and looking as though he meant to give himself airs; while\r\nCrofts got himself quickly up to the fireplace, making civil little\r\nspeeches to Mrs. Dale, Mrs. Boyce, and Mrs. Hearn. And then at last\r\nhe made his way round to Bell.\r\n\r\n"I am so glad," he said, "to congratulate you on your sister\'s\r\nengagement."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Bell; "we knew that you would be glad to hear of her\r\nhappiness."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I am glad; and thoroughly hope that she may be happy. You\r\nall like him, do you not?"\r\n\r\n"We like him very much."\r\n\r\n"And I am told that he is well off. He is a very fortunate man,--very\r\nfortunate,--very fortunate."\r\n\r\n"Of course we think so," said Bell. "Not, however, because he is\r\nrich."\r\n\r\n"No; not because he is rich. But because, being worthy of such\r\nhappiness, his circumstances should enable him to marry, and to enjoy\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Yes, exactly," said Bell. "That is just it." Then she sat down, and\r\nin sitting down put an end to the conversation. "That is just it,"\r\nshe had said. But as soon as the words were spoken she declared to\r\nherself that it was not so, and that Crofts was wrong. "We love him,"\r\nshe said to herself, "not because he is rich enough to marry without\r\nanxious thought, but because he dares to marry although he is not\r\nrich." And then she told herself that she was angry with the doctor.\r\n\r\nAfter that Dr. Crofts got off towards the door, and stood there by\r\nhimself, leaning against the wall, with the thumbs of both his hands\r\nstuck into the armholes of his waistcoat. People said that he was a\r\nshy man. I suppose he was shy, and yet he was a man that was by no\r\nmeans afraid of doing anything that he had to do. He could speak\r\nbefore a multitude without being abashed, whether it was a multitude\r\nof men or of women. He could be very fixed too in his own opinion,\r\nand eager, if not violent, in the prosecution of his purpose. But he\r\ncould not stand and say little words, when he had in truth nothing\r\nto say. He could not keep his ground when he felt that he was not\r\nusing the ground upon which he stood. He had not learned the art of\r\nassuming himself to be of importance in whatever place he might find\r\nhimself. It was this art which Crosbie had learned, and by this art\r\nthat he had flourished. So Crofts retired and leaned against the wall\r\nnear the door; and Crosbie came forward and shone like an Apollo\r\namong all the guests. "How is it that he does it?" said John Eames to\r\nhimself, envying the perfect happiness of the London man of fashion.\r\n\r\nAt last Lily got the dancers out upon the lawn, and then they managed\r\nto go through one quadrille. But it was found that it did not answer.\r\nThe music of the single fiddle which Crosbie had hired from Guestwick\r\nwas not sufficient for the purpose; and then the grass, though it was\r\nperfect for purposes of croquet, was not pleasant to the feet for\r\ndancing.\r\n\r\n"This is very nice," said Bernard to his cousin. "I don\'t know\r\nanything that could be nicer; but perhaps--"\r\n\r\n"I know what you mean," said Lily. "But I shall stay here. There\'s no\r\ntouch of romance about any of you. Look at the moon there at the back\r\nof the steeple. I don\'t mean to go in all night." Then she walked off\r\nby one of the paths, and her lover went after her.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you like the moon?" she said, as she took his arm, to which\r\nshe was now so accustomed that she hardly thought of it as she took\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Like the moon?--well; I fancy I like the sun better. I don\'t quite\r\nbelieve in moonlight. I think it does best to talk about when one\r\nwants to be sentimental."\r\n\r\n"Ah; that is just what I fear. That is what I say to Bell when I tell\r\nher that her romance will fade as the roses do. And then I shall have\r\nto learn that prose is more serviceable than poetry, and that the\r\nmind is better than the heart, and--and that money is better than\r\nlove. It\'s all coming, I know; and yet I do like the moonlight."\r\n\r\n"And the poetry,--and the love?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. The poetry much, and the love more. To be loved by you is\r\nsweeter even than any of my dreams,--is better than all the poetry\r\nI have read."\r\n\r\n"Dearest Lily," and his unchecked arm stole round her waist.\r\n\r\n"It is the meaning of the moonlight, and the essence of the poetry,"\r\ncontinued the impassioned girl. "I did not know then why I liked such\r\nthings, but now I know. It was because I longed to be loved."\r\n\r\n"And to love."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. I would be nothing without that. But that, you know, is\r\nyour delight,--or should be. The other is mine. And yet it is a\r\ndelight to love you; to know that I may love you."\r\n\r\n"You mean that this is the realization of your romance."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but it must not be the end of it, Adolphus. You must like the\r\nsoft twilight, and the long evenings when we shall be alone; and you\r\nmust read to me the books I love, and you must not teach me to think\r\nthat the world is hard, and dry, and cruel,--not yet. I tell Bell so\r\nvery often; but you must not say so to me."\r\n\r\n"It shall not be dry and cruel, if I can prevent it."\r\n\r\n"You understand what I mean, dearest. I will not think it dry and\r\ncruel, even though sorrow should come upon us, if you-- I think you\r\nknow what I mean."\r\n\r\n"If I am good to you."\r\n\r\n"I am not afraid of that;--I am not the least afraid of that. You do\r\nnot think that I could ever distrust you? But you must not be ashamed\r\nto look at the moonlight, and to read poetry, and to--"\r\n\r\n"To talk nonsense, you mean."\r\n\r\nBut as he said it, he pressed her closer to his side, and his tone\r\nwas pleasant to her.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I\'m talking nonsense now?" she said, pouting. "You liked\r\nme better when I was talking about the pigs; didn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"No; I like you best now."\r\n\r\n"And why didn\'t you like me then? Did I say anything to offend you?"\r\n\r\n"I like you best now, because--"\r\n\r\nThey were standing in the narrow pathway of the gate leading from\r\nthe bridge into the gardens of the Great House, and the shadow of\r\nthe thick-spreading laurels was around them. But the moonlight still\r\npierced brightly through the little avenue, and she, as she looked up\r\nto him, could see the form of his face and the loving softness of his\r\neye.\r\n\r\n"Because--," said he; and then he stooped over her and pressed her\r\nclosely, while she put up her lips to his, standing on tip-toe that\r\nshe might reach to his face.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my love!" she said. "My love! my love!"\r\n\r\nAs Crosbie walked back to the Great House that night, he made a firm\r\nresolution that no consideration of worldly welfare should ever\r\ninduce him to break his engagement with Lily Dale. He went somewhat\r\nfurther also, and determined that he would not put off the marriage\r\nfor more than six or eight months, or, at the most, ten, if he could\r\npossibly get his affairs arranged in that time. To be sure, he must\r\ngive up everything,--all the aspirations and ambition of his life;\r\nbut then, as he declared to himself somewhat mournfully, he was\r\nprepared to do that. Such were his resolutions, and, as he thought of\r\nthem in bed, he came to the conclusion that few men were less selfish\r\nthan he was.\r\n\r\n"But what will they say to us for staying away?" said Lily,\r\nrecovering herself. "And I ought to be making the people dance, you\r\nknow. Come along, and do make yourself nice. Do waltz with Mary\r\nEames;--pray, do. If you don\'t, I won\'t speak to you all night!"\r\n\r\nActing under which threat, Crosbie did, on his return, solicit the\r\nhonour of that young lady\'s hand, thereby elating her into a seventh\r\nheaven of happiness. What could the world afford better than a waltz\r\nwith such a partner as Adolphus Crosbie? And poor Mary Eames could\r\nwaltz well; though she could not talk much as she danced, and would\r\npant a good deal when she stopped. She put too much of her energy\r\ninto the motion, and was too anxious to do the mechanical part of\r\nthe work in a manner that should be satisfactory to her partner.\r\n"Oh! thank you;--it\'s very nice. I shall be able to go on--again\r\ndirectly." Her conversation with Crosbie did not get much beyond\r\nthat, and yet she felt that she had never done better than on this\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThough there were, at most, not above five couples of dancers, and\r\nthough they who did not dance, such as the squire and Mr. Boyce, and\r\na curate from a neighbouring parish, had, in fact, nothing to amuse\r\nthem, the affair was kept on very merrily for a considerable number\r\nof hours. Exactly at twelve o\'clock there was a little supper, which,\r\nno doubt, served to relieve Mrs. Hearn\'s ennui, and at which Mrs.\r\nBoyce also seemed to enjoy herself. As to the Mrs. Boyces on such\r\noccasions, I profess that I feel no pity. They are generally happy in\r\ntheir children\'s happiness, or if not, they ought to be. At any rate,\r\nthey are simply performing a manifest duty, which duty, in their\r\ntime, was performed on their behalf. But on what account do the Mrs.\r\nHearns betake themselves to such gatherings? Why did that ancient\r\nlady sit there hour after hour yawning, longing for her bed, looking\r\nevery ten minutes at her watch, while her old bones were stiff and\r\nsore, and her old ears pained with the noise? It could hardly have\r\nbeen simply for the sake of the supper. After the supper, however,\r\nher maid took her across to her cottage, and Mrs. Boyce also then\r\nstole away home, and the squire went off with some little parade,\r\nsuggesting to the young men that they should make no noise in the\r\nhouse as they returned. But the poor curate remained, talking a dull\r\nword every now and then to Mrs. Dale, and looking on with tantalized\r\neyes at the joys which the world had prepared for others than him. I\r\nmust say that I think that public opinion and the bishops together\r\nare too hard upon curates in this particular.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the night\'s delight, when time and practice had\r\nmade them all happy together, John Eames stood up for the first time\r\nto dance with Lily. She had done all she could, short of asking him,\r\nto induce him to do her this favour; for she felt that it would be a\r\nfavour. How great had been the desire on his part to ask her, and, at\r\nthe same time, how great the repugnance, Lily, perhaps, did not quite\r\nunderstand. And yet she understood much of it. She knew that he was\r\nnot angry with her. She knew that he was suffering from the injured\r\npride of futile love, almost as much as from the futile love itself.\r\nShe wished to put him at his ease in this; but she did not quite give\r\nhim credit for the full sincerity, and the upright, uncontrolled\r\nheartiness of his feelings.\r\n\r\nAt length he did come up to her, and though, in truth, she was\r\nengaged, she at once accepted his offer. Then she tripped across the\r\nroom. "Adolphus," she said, "I can\'t dance with you, though I said\r\nI would. John Eames has asked me, and I haven\'t stood up with him\r\nbefore. You understand, and you\'ll be a good boy, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\nCrosbie, not being in the least jealous, was a good boy, and sat\r\nhimself down to rest, hidden behind a door.\r\n\r\nFor the first few minutes the conversation between Eames and Lily\r\nwas of a very matter-of-fact kind. She repeated her wish that she\r\nmight see him in London, and he said that of course he should come\r\nand call. Then there was silence for a little while, and they went\r\nthrough their figure dancing.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t at all know yet when we are to be married," said Lily, as\r\nsoon as they were again standing together.\r\n\r\n"No; I dare say not," said Eames.\r\n\r\n"But not this year, I suppose. Indeed, I should say, of course not."\r\n\r\n"In the spring, perhaps," suggested Eames. He had an unconscious\r\ndesire that it might be postponed to some Greek kalends, and yet he\r\ndid not wish to injure Lily.\r\n\r\n"The reason I mention it is this, that we should be so very glad if\r\nyou could be here. We all love you so much, and I should so like to\r\nhave you here on that day."\r\n\r\nWhy is it that girls so constantly do this,--so frequently ask men\r\nwho have loved them to be present at their marriages with other\r\nmen? There is no triumph in it. It is done in sheer kindness and\r\naffection. They intend to offer something which shall soften and\r\nnot aggravate the sorrow that they have caused. "You can\'t marry me\r\nyourself," the lady seems to say. "But the next greatest blessing\r\nwhich I can offer you shall be yours,--you shall see me married to\r\nsomebody else." I fully appreciate the intention, but in honest\r\ntruth, I doubt the eligibility of the proffered entertainment.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion John Eames seemed to be of this opinion, for\r\nhe did not at once accept the invitation.\r\n\r\n"Will you not oblige me so far as that?" said she softly.\r\n\r\n"I would do anything to oblige you," said he gruffly; "almost\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"But not that?"\r\n\r\n"No; not that. I could not do that." Then he went off upon his\r\nfigure, and when they were next both standing together, they remained\r\nsilent till their turn for dancing had again come. Why was it, that\r\nafter that night Lily thought more of John Eames than ever she had\r\nthought before;--felt for him, I mean, a higher respect, as for a man\r\nwho had a will of his own?\r\n\r\nAnd in that quadrille Crofts and Bell had been dancing together, and\r\nthey also had been talking of Lily\'s marriage. "A man may undergo\r\nwhat he likes for himself," he had said, "but he has no right to make\r\na woman undergo poverty."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"That which is no suffering for a man,--which no man should think of\r\nfor himself,--will make a hell on earth for a woman."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it would," said Bell, answering him without a sign of\r\nfeeling in her face or voice. But she took in every word that he\r\nspoke, and disputed their truth inwardly with all the strength of\r\nher heart and mind, and with the very vehemence of her soul. "As if\r\na woman cannot bear more than a man!" she said to herself, as she\r\nwalked the length of the room alone, when she had got herself free\r\nfrom the doctor\'s arm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nMRS. LUPEX AND AMELIA ROPER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: (untitled)]\r\n\r\nI should simply mislead a confiding reader if I were to tell him that\r\nMrs. Lupex was an amiable woman. Perhaps the fact that she was not\r\namiable is the one great fault that should be laid to her charge;\r\nbut that fault had spread itself so widely, and had cropped forth in\r\nso many different places of her life, like a strong rank plant that\r\nwill show itself all over a garden, that it may almost be said that\r\nit made her odious in every branch of life, and detestable alike\r\nto those who knew her little and to those who knew her much. If a\r\nsearcher could have got at the inside spirit of the woman, that\r\nsearcher would have found that she wished to go right,--that she did\r\nmake, or at any rate promise to herself that she would make, certain\r\nstruggles to attain decency and propriety. But it was so natural to\r\nher to torment those whose misfortune brought them near to her, and\r\nespecially that wretched man who in an evil day had taken her to his\r\nbosom as his wife, that decency fled from her, and propriety would\r\nnot live in her quarters.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lupex was, as I have already described her, a woman not without\r\nsome feminine attraction in the eyes of those who like morning\r\nnegligence and evening finery, and do not object to a long nose\r\nsomewhat on one side. She was clever in her way, and could say\r\nsmart things. She could flatter also, though her very flattery had\r\nalways in it something that was disagreeable. And she must have had\r\nsome power of will, as otherwise her husband would have escaped\r\nfrom her before the days of which I am writing. Otherwise, also,\r\nshe could hardly have obtained her footing and kept it in Mrs.\r\nRoper\'s drawing-room. For though the hundred pounds a year, either\r\npaid, or promised to be paid, was matter with Mrs. Roper of vast\r\nconsideration, nevertheless the first three months of Mrs. Lupex\'s\r\nsojourn in Burton Crescent were not over before the landlady of that\r\nhouse was most anxiously desirous of getting herself quit of her\r\nmarried boarders.\r\n\r\nI shall perhaps best describe a little incident that had occurred\r\nin Burton Crescent during the absence of our friend Eames, and the\r\nmanner in which things were going on in that locality, by giving at\r\nlength two letters which Johnny received by post at Guestwick on the\r\nmorning after Mrs. Dale\'s party. One was from his friend Cradell,\r\nand the other from the devoted Amelia. In this instance I will give\r\nthat from the gentleman first, presuming that I shall best consult\r\nmy reader\'s wishes by keeping the greater delicacy till the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Income-tax Office, September, 186--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR JOHNNY,--We have had a terrible affair in the\r\n   Crescent; and I really hardly know how to tell you; and\r\n   yet I must do it, for I want your advice. You know the\r\n   sort of standing that I was on with Mrs. Lupex, and\r\n   perhaps you remember what we were saying on the platform\r\n   at the station. I have, no doubt, been fond of her\r\n   society, as I might be of that of any other friend. I\r\n   knew, of course, that she was a fine woman; and if her\r\n   husband chose to be jealous, I couldn\'t help that. But I\r\n   never intended anything wrong; and, if it was necessary,\r\n   couldn\'t I call you as a witness to prove it? I never\r\n   spoke a word to her out of Mrs. Roper\'s drawing-room; and\r\n   Miss Spruce, or Mrs. Roper, or somebody has always been\r\n   there. You know he drinks horribly sometimes, but I do\r\n   not think he ever gets downright drunk. Well, he came\r\n   home last night about nine o\'clock after one of these\r\n   bouts. From what Jemima says [Jemima was Mrs. Roper\'s\r\n   parlour-maid], I believe he had been at it down at the\r\n   theatre for three days. We hadn\'t seen him since Tuesday.\r\n   He went straight into the parlour and sent up Jemima to\r\n   me, to say that he wanted to see me. Mrs. Lupex was in\r\n   the room and heard the girl summon me, and, jumping up,\r\n   she declared that if there was going to be blood shed she\r\n   would leave the house. There was nobody else in the room\r\n   but Miss Spruce, and she didn\'t say a word, but took her\r\n   candle and went upstairs. You must own it looked very\r\n   uncomfortable. What was I to do with a drunken man down in\r\n   the parlour? However, she seemed to think I ought to go.\r\n   "If he comes up here," said she, "I shall be the victim.\r\n   You little know of what that man is capable when his wrath\r\n   has been inflamed by wine!" Now, I think you are aware\r\n   that I am not likely to be very much afraid of any man;\r\n   but why was I to be got into a row in such a way as this?\r\n   I hadn\'t done anything. And then, if there was to be a\r\n   quarrel, and anything was to come of it, as she seemed to\r\n   expect,--like bloodshed, I mean, or a fight, or if he were\r\n   to knock me on the head with the poker, where should I be\r\n   at my office? A man in a public office, as you and I are,\r\n   can\'t quarrel like anybody else. It was this that I felt\r\n   so much at the moment. "Go down to him," said she, "unless\r\n   you wish to see me murdered at your feet." Fisher says,\r\n   that if what I say is true, they must have arranged it all\r\n   between them. I don\'t think that; for I do believe that\r\n   she really is fond of me. And then everybody knows that\r\n   they never do agree about anything. But she certainly did\r\n   implore me to go down to him. Well, I went down; and, as I\r\n   got to the bottom of the stairs, where I found Jemima, I\r\n   heard him walking up and down the parlour. "Take care of\r\n   yourself, Mr. Cradell," said the girl; and I could see by\r\n   her face that she was in a terrible fright.\r\n\r\n   At that moment I happened to see my hat on the hall table,\r\n   and it occurred to me that I ought to put myself into the\r\n   hands of a friend. Of course, I was not afraid of that\r\n   man in the dining-room; but should I have been justified\r\n   in engaging in a struggle, perhaps for dear life, in Mrs.\r\n   Roper\'s house? I was bound to think of her interests.\r\n   So I took up my hat, and deliberately walked out of the\r\n   front door. "Tell him," said I to Jemima, "that I\'m not at\r\n   home." And so I went away direct to Fisher\'s, meaning to\r\n   send him back to Lupex as my friend; but Fisher was at his\r\n   chess-club.\r\n\r\n   As I thought there was no time to be lost on such an\r\n   occasion as this, I went down to the club and called\r\n   him out. You know what a cool fellow Fisher is. I don\'t\r\n   suppose anything would ever excite him. When I told him\r\n   the story, he said that he would sleep upon it; and I had\r\n   to walk up and down before the club while he finished\r\n   his game. Fisher seemed to think that I might go back to\r\n   Burton Crescent; but, of course, I knew that that would\r\n   be out of the question. So it ended in my going home and\r\n   sleeping on his sofa, and sending for some of my things in\r\n   the morning. I wanted him to get up and see Lupex before\r\n   going to the office this morning. But he said it would be\r\n   better to put it off, and so he will call upon him at the\r\n   theatre immediately after office hours.\r\n\r\n   I want you to write to me at once saying what you know\r\n   about the matter. I ask you, as I don\'t want to lug in any\r\n   of the other people at Roper\'s. It is very uncomfortable,\r\n   as I can\'t exactly leave her at once because of last\r\n   quarter\'s money, otherwise I should cut and run; for the\r\n   house is not the sort of place either for you or me. You\r\n   may take my word for that, Master Johnny. And I could tell\r\n   you something, too, about A. R., only I don\'t want to make\r\n   mischief. But do you write immediately. And now I think of\r\n   it, you had better write to Fisher, so that he can show\r\n   your letter to Lupex,--just saying, that to the best of\r\n   your belief there had never been anything between her and\r\n   me but mere friendship; and that, of course, you, as my\r\n   friend, must have known everything. Whether I shall go\r\n   back to Roper\'s to-night will depend on what Fisher says\r\n   after the interview.\r\n\r\n   Good-by, old fellow! I hope you are enjoying yourself, and\r\n   that L. D. is quite well.--Your sincere friend,\r\n\r\n   JOSEPH CRADELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Eames read this letter over twice before he opened that from\r\nAmelia. He had never yet received a letter from Miss Roper; and felt\r\nvery little of that ardour for its perusal which young men generally\r\nexperience on the receipt of a first letter from a young lady. The\r\nmemory of Amelia was at the present moment distasteful to him; and he\r\nwould have thrown the letter unopened into the fire, had he not felt\r\nit might be dangerous to do so. As regarded his friend Cradell, he\r\ncould not but feel ashamed of him,--ashamed of him, not for running\r\naway from Mr. Lupex, but for excusing his escape on false pretences.\r\n\r\nAnd then, at last, he opened the letter from Amelia. "Dearest John,"\r\nit began; and as he read the words, he crumpled the paper up between\r\nhis fingers. It was written in a fair female hand, with sharp points\r\ninstead of curves to the letters, but still very legible, and looking\r\nas though there were a decided purport in every word of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAREST JOHN,--It feels so strange to me to write to you\r\n   in such language as this. And yet you are dearest, and\r\n   have I not a right to call you so? And are you not my own,\r\n   and am not I yours?\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain he crunched the paper up in his hand, and, as he did so, he\r\nmuttered words which I need not repeat at length. But still he went\r\non with his letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n   I know that we understand each other perfectly, and when\r\n   that is the case, heart should be allowed to speak openly\r\n   to heart. Those are my feelings, and I believe that you\r\n   will find them reciprocal in your own bosom. Is it not\r\n   sweet to be loved? I find it so. And, dearest John, let me\r\n   assure you, with open candour, that there is no room for\r\n   jealousy in this breast with regard to you. I have too\r\n   much confidence for that, I can assure you, both in your\r\n   honour and in my own--I would say charms, only you would\r\n   call me vain. You must not suppose that I meant what I\r\n   said about L. D. Of course, you will be glad to see the\r\n   friends of your childhood; and it would be far from your\r\n   Amelia\'s heart to begrudge you such delightful pleasure.\r\n   Your friends will, I hope, some day be my friends.\r\n   [Another crunch.] And if there be any one among them, any\r\n   real L. D. whom you have specially liked, I will receive\r\n   her to my heart, specially also.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis assurance on the part of his Amelia was too much for him,\r\nand he threw the letter from him, thinking whence he might get\r\nrelief--whether from suicide or from the colonies; but presently he\r\ntook it up again, and drained the bitter cup to the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n   And if I seemed petulant to you before you went away, you\r\n   must forgive your own Amelia. I had nothing before me but\r\n   misery for the month of your absence. There is no one here\r\n   congenial to my feelings,--of course not. And you would\r\n   not wish me to be happy in your absence,--would you? I can\r\n   assure you, let your wishes be what they may, I never can\r\n   be happy again unless you are with me. Write to me one\r\n   little line, and tell me that you are grateful to me for\r\n   my devotion.\r\n\r\n   And now, I must tell you that we have had a sad affair in\r\n   the house; and I do not think that your friend Mr. Cradell\r\n   has behaved at all well. You remember how he has been\r\n   always going on with Mrs. Lupex. Mother was quite unhappy\r\n   about it, though she didn\'t like to say anything. Of\r\n   course, when a lady\'s name is concerned, it is particular.\r\n   But Lupex has become dreadful jealous during the last\r\n   week; and we all knew that something was coming. She is\r\n   an artful woman, but I don\'t think she meant anything\r\n   bad--only to drive her husband to desperation. He came\r\n   here yesterday in one of his tantrums, and wanted to see\r\n   Cradell; but he got frightened, and took his hat and went\r\n   off. Now, that wasn\'t quite right. If he was innocent,\r\n   why didn\'t he stand his ground and explain the mistake?\r\n   As mother says, it gives the house such a name. Lupex\r\n   swore last night that he\'d be off to the Income-tax\r\n   Office this morning, and have Cradell out before all the\r\n   commissioners, and clerks, and everybody. If he does\r\n   that, it will get into the papers, and all London will be\r\n   full of it. She would like it, I know; for all she cares\r\n   for is to be talked about; but only think what it will\r\n   be for mother\'s house. I wish you were here; for your\r\n   high prudence and courage would set everything right at\r\n   once,--at least, I think so.\r\n\r\n   I shall count the minutes till I get an answer to this,\r\n   and shall envy the postman who will have your letter\r\n   before it will reach me. Do write at once. If I do not\r\n   hear by Monday morning I shall think that something is the\r\n   matter. Even though you are among your dear old friends,\r\n   surely you can find a moment to write to your own Amelia.\r\n\r\n   Mother is very unhappy about this affair of the Lupexes.\r\n   She says that if you were here to advise her she should\r\n   not mind it so much. It is very hard upon her, for she\r\n   does strive to make the house respectable and comfortable\r\n   for everybody. I would send my duty and love to your dear\r\n   mamma, if I only knew her, as I hope I shall do one day,\r\n   and to your sister, and to L. D. also, if you like to tell\r\n   her how we are situated together. So, now, no more from\r\n   your\r\n\r\n   Always affectionate sweetheart,\r\n\r\n   AMELIA ROPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor Eames did not feel the least gratified by any part of this fond\r\nletter; but the last paragraph of it was the worst. Was it to be\r\nendured by him that this woman should send her love to his mother\r\nand to his sister, and even to Lily Dale! He felt that there was a\r\npollution in the very mention of Lily\'s name by such an one as Amelia\r\nRoper. And yet Amelia Roper was, as she had assured him,--his own.\r\nMuch as he disliked her at the present moment, he did believe that he\r\nwas--her own. He did feel that she had obtained a certain property\r\nin him, and that his destiny in life would tie him to her. He had\r\nsaid very few words of love to her at any time--very few, at least,\r\nthat were themselves of any moment; but among those few there had\r\nundoubtedly been one or two in which he had told her that he loved\r\nher. And he had written to her that fatal note! Upon the whole, would\r\nit not be as well for him to go out to the great reservoir behind\r\nGuestwick, by which the Hamersham Canal was fed with its waters, and\r\nput an end to his miserable existence?\r\n\r\nOn that same day he did write a letter to Fisher, and he wrote also\r\nto Cradell. As to those letters he felt no difficulty. To Fisher he\r\ndeclared his belief that Cradell was innocent as he was himself as\r\nregarded Mrs. Lupex. "I don\'t think he is the sort of man to make\r\nup to a married woman," he said, somewhat to Cradell\'s displeasure,\r\nwhen the letter reached the Income-tax Office; for that gentleman\r\nwas not averse to the reputation for success in love which the\r\nlittle adventure was, as he thought, calculated to give him among\r\nhis brother clerks. At the first bursting of the shell, when that\r\ndesperately jealous man was raging in the parlour, incensed by the\r\nfumes both of wine and love, Cradell had felt that the affair was\r\ndisagreeably painful. But on the morning of the third day--for he had\r\npassed two nights on his friend Fisher\'s sofa--he had begun to be\r\nsomewhat proud of it, and did not dislike to hear Mrs. Lupex\'s name\r\nin the mouths of the other clerks. When, therefore, Fisher read\r\nto him the letter from Guestwick, he hardly was pleased with his\r\nfriend\'s tone. "Ha, ha, ha," said he, laughing. "That\'s just what I\r\nwanted him to say. Make up to a married woman, indeed. No; I\'m the\r\nlast man in London to do that sort of thing."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, Caudle, I think you are," said Fisher; "the very last\r\nman."\r\n\r\nAnd then poor Cradell was not happy. On that afternoon he boldly went\r\nto Burton Crescent, and ate his dinner there. Neither Mr. nor Mrs.\r\nLupex were to be seen, nor were their names mentioned to him by Mrs.\r\nRoper. In the course of the evening he did pluck up courage to ask\r\nMiss Spruce where they were; but that ancient lady merely shook her\r\nhead solemnly, and declared that she knew nothing about such goings\r\non--no, not she.\r\n\r\nBut what was John Eames to do as to that letter from Amelia Roper? He\r\nfelt that any answer to it would be very dangerous, and yet that he\r\ncould not safely leave it unanswered. He walked off by himself across\r\nGuestwick Common, and through the woods of Guestwick Manor, up by the\r\nbig avenue of elms in Lord De Guest\'s park, trying to resolve how he\r\nmight rescue himself from this scrape. Here, over the same ground,\r\nhe had wandered scores of times in his earlier years, when he knew\r\nnothing beyond the innocency of his country home, thinking of Lily\r\nDale, and swearing to himself that she should be his wife. Here he\r\nhad strung together his rhymes, and fed his ambition with high hopes,\r\nbuilding gorgeous castles in the air, in all of which Lilian reigned\r\nas a queen; and though in those days he had known himself to be\r\nawkward, poor, uncared for by any in the world except his mother and\r\nhis sister, yet he had been happy in his hopes--happy in his hopes,\r\neven though he had never taught himself really to believe that they\r\nwould be realized. But now there was nothing in his hopes or thoughts\r\nto make him happy. Everything was black, and wretched, and ruinous.\r\nWhat would it matter, after all, even if he should marry Amelia\r\nRoper, seeing that Lily was to be given to another? But then the idea\r\nof Amelia as he had seen her that night through the chink in the door\r\ncame upon his memory, and he confessed to himself that life with such\r\na wife as that would be a living death.\r\n\r\nAt one moment he thought that he would tell his mother everything,\r\nand leave her to write an answer to Amelia\'s letter. Should the worst\r\ncome to the worst, the Ropers could not absolutely destroy him. That\r\nthey could bring an action against him, and have him locked up for a\r\nterm of years, and dismissed from his office, and exposed in all the\r\nnewspapers, he seemed to know. That might all, however, be endured,\r\nif only the gauntlet could be thrown down for him by some one else.\r\nThe one thing which he felt that he could not do was, to write to\r\na girl whom he had professed to love, and tell her that he did not\r\nlove her. He knew that he could not himself form such words upon the\r\npaper; nor, as he was well aware, could he himself find the courage\r\nto tell her to her face that he had changed his mind. He knew that\r\nhe must become the victim of his Amelia, unless he could find some\r\nfriendly knight to do battle in his favour; and then again he thought\r\nof his mother.\r\n\r\nBut when he returned home he was as far as ever from any resolve to\r\ntell her how he was situated. I may say that his walk had done him no\r\ngood, and that he had not made up his mind to anything. He had been\r\nbuilding those pernicious castles in the air during more than half\r\nthe time; not castles in the building of which he could make himself\r\nhappy, as he had done in the old days, but black castles, with cruel\r\ndungeons, into which hardly a ray of light could find its way. In all\r\nthese edifices his imagination pictured to him Lily as the wife of\r\nMr. Crosbie. He accepted that as a fact, and then went to work in his\r\nmisery, making her as wretched as himself, through the misconduct\r\nand harshness of her husband. He tried to think, and to resolve what\r\nhe would do; but there is no task so hard as that of thinking, when\r\nthe mind has an objection to the matter brought before it. The mind,\r\nunder such circumstances, is like a horse that is brought to the\r\nwater, but refuses to drink. So Johnny returned to his home, still\r\ndoubting whether or no he would answer Amelia\'s letter. And if he did\r\nnot answer it, how would he conduct himself on his return to Burton\r\nCrescent?\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that Miss Roper, in writing her letter, had been\r\naware of all this, and that Johnny\'s position had been carefully\r\nprepared for him by--his affectionate sweetheart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Lupex had eaten a sweetbread together in much connubial\r\nbliss on that day which had seen Cradell returning to Mrs. Roper\'s\r\nhospitable board. They had together eaten a sweetbread, with\r\nsome other delicacies of the season, in the neighbourhood of the\r\ntheatre, and had washed down all unkindness with bitter beer and\r\nbrandy-and-water. But of this reconciliation Cradell had not heard;\r\nand when he saw them come together into the drawing-room, a few\r\nminutes after the question he had addressed to Miss Spruce, he was\r\ncertainly surprised.\r\n\r\nLupex was not an ill-natured man, nor one naturally savage by\r\ndisposition. He was a man fond of sweetbread and little dinners, and\r\none to whom hot brandy-and-water was too dear. Had the wife of his\r\nbosom been a good helpmate to him, he might have gone through the\r\nworld, if not respectably, at any rate without open disgrace. But\r\nshe was a woman who left a man no solace except that to be found in\r\nbrandy-and-water. For eight years they had been man and wife; and\r\nsometimes--I grieve to say it--he had been driven almost to hope\r\nthat she would commit a married woman\'s last sin, and leave him. In\r\nhis misery, any mode of escape would have been welcome to him. Had\r\nhis energy been sufficient he would have taken his scene-painting\r\ncapabilities off to Australia,--or to the farthest shifting of\r\nscenes known on the world\'s stage. But he was an easy, listless,\r\nself-indulgent man; and at any moment, let his misery be as keen\r\nas might be, a little dinner, a few soft words, and a glass of\r\nbrandy-and-water would bring him round. The second glass would make\r\nhim the fondest husband living; but the third would restore to him\r\nthe memory of all his wrongs, and give him courage against his wife\r\nor all the world,--even to the detriment of the furniture around him,\r\nshould a stray poker chance to meet his hand. All these peculiarities\r\nof his character were not, however, known to Cradell; and when our\r\nfriend saw him enter the drawing-room with his wife on his arm, he\r\nwas astonished.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Cradell, your hand," said Lupex, who had advanced as far as the\r\nsecond glass of brandy-and-water, but had not been allowed to go\r\nbeyond it. "There has been a misunderstanding between us; let it be\r\nforgotten."\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: "Mr. Cradell, your hand," said Lupex.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Mr. Cradell, if I know him," said the lady, "is too much the\r\ngentleman to bear any anger when a gentleman has offered him his\r\nhand."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m sure," said Cradell, "I\'m quite--indeed, I\'m delighted to\r\nfind there\'s nothing wrong after all." And then he shook hands with\r\nboth of them; whereupon Miss Spruce got up, curtseyed low, and also\r\nshook hands with the husband and wife.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not a married man, Mr. Cradell," said Lupex, "and, therefore,\r\nyou cannot understand the workings of a husband\'s heart. There have\r\nbeen moments when my regard for that woman has been too much for me."\r\n\r\n"Now, Lupex, don\'t," said she, playfully tapping him with an old\r\nparasol which she still held.\r\n\r\n"And I do not hesitate to say that my regard for her was too much for\r\nme on that night when I sent for you to the dining-room."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad it\'s all put right now," said Cradell.\r\n\r\n"Very glad, indeed," said Miss Spruce.\r\n\r\n"And, therefore, we need not say any more about it," said Mrs. Lupex.\r\n\r\n"One word," said Lupex, waving his hand. "Mr. Cradell, I greatly\r\nrejoice that you did not obey my summons on that night. Had you done\r\nso,--I confess it now,--had you done so, blood would have been the\r\nconsequence. I was mistaken. I acknowledge my mistake;--but blood\r\nwould have been the consequence."\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear, dear," said Miss Spruce.\r\n\r\n"Miss Spruce," continued Lupex, "there are moments when the heart\r\nbecomes too strong for a man."\r\n\r\n"I dare say," said Miss Spruce.\r\n\r\n"Now, Lupex, that will do," said his wife.\r\n\r\n"Yes; that will do. But I think it right to tell Mr. Cradell that I\r\nam glad he did not come to me. Your friend, Mr. Cradell, did me the\r\nhonour of calling on me at the theatre yesterday, at half-past four;\r\nbut I was in the slings then, and could not very well come down\r\nto him. I shall be happy to see you both any day at five, and to\r\nbury all unkindness with a chop and glass at the Pot and Poker, in\r\nBow-street."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure you\'re very kind," said Cradell.\r\n\r\n"And Mrs. Lupex will join us. There\'s a delightful little snuggery\r\nupstairs at the Pot and Poker; and if Miss Spruce will condescend\r\nto--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m an old woman, sir."\r\n\r\n"No--no--no," said Lupex, "I deny that. Come, Cradell, what do you\r\nsay?--just a snug little dinner for four, you know."\r\n\r\nIt was, no doubt, pleasant to see Mr. Lupex in his present\r\nmood,--much pleasanter than in that other mood of which blood\r\nwould have been the consequence; but pleasant as he now was, it\r\nwas, nevertheless, apparent that he was not quite sober. Cradell,\r\ntherefore, did not settle the day for the little dinner; but merely\r\nremarked that he should be very happy at some future day.\r\n\r\n"And now, Lupex, suppose you get off to bed," said his wife. "You\'ve\r\nhad a very trying day, you know."\r\n\r\n"And you, ducky?"\r\n\r\n"I shall come presently. Now don\'t be making a fool of yourself, but\r\nget yourself off. Come--" and she stood close up against the open\r\ndoor, waiting for him to pass.\r\n\r\n"I rather think I shall remain where I am, and have a glass of\r\nsomething hot," said he.\r\n\r\n"Lupex, do you want to aggravate me again?" said the lady, and\r\nshe looked at him with a glance of her eye which he thoroughly\r\nunderstood. He was not in a humour for fighting, nor was he at\r\npresent desirous of blood; so he resolved to go. But as he went he\r\nprepared himself for new battles. "I shall do something desperate,\r\nI am sure; I know I shall," he said, as he pulled off his boots.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Cradell," said Mrs. Lupex as soon as she had closed the\r\ndoor behind her retreating husband, "how am I ever to look you in\r\nthe face again after the events of these last memorable days?" And\r\nthen she seated herself on the sofa, and hid her face in a cambric\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\n"As for that," said Cradell, "what does it signify,--among friends\r\nlike us, you know?"\r\n\r\n"But that it should be known at your office,--as of course it is,\r\nbecause of the gentleman that went down to him at the theatre!--I\r\ndon\'t think I shall ever survive it."\r\n\r\n"You see I was obliged to send somebody, Mrs. Lupex."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not finding fault, Mr. Cradell. I know very well that in my\r\nmelancholy position I have no right to find fault, and I don\'t\r\npretend to understand gentlemen\'s feelings towards each other. But\r\nto have had my name mentioned up with yours in that way is-- Oh! Mr.\r\nCradell, I don\'t know how I\'m ever to look you in the face again."\r\nAnd again she buried hers in her pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n"Handsome is as handsome does," said Miss Spruce; and there was that\r\nin her tone of voice which seemed to convey much hidden meaning.\r\n\r\n"Exactly so, Miss Spruce," said Mrs. Lupex; "and that\'s my only\r\ncomfort at the present moment. Mr. Cradell is a gentleman who would\r\nscorn to take advantage--I\'m quite sure of that." And then she did\r\ncontrive to look at him over the edge of the hand which held the\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\n"That I wouldn\'t, I\'m sure," said Cradell. "That is to say--" And\r\nthen he paused. He did not wish to get into a scrape about Mrs.\r\nLupex. He was by no means anxious to encounter her husband in one of\r\nhis fits of jealousy. But he did like the idea of being talked of as\r\nthe admirer of a married woman, and he did like the brightness of\r\nthe lady\'s eyes. When the unfortunate moth in his semi-blindness\r\nwhisks himself and his wings within the flame of the candle, and\r\nfinds himself mutilated and tortured, he even then will not take\r\nthe lesson, but returns again and again till he is destroyed. Such\r\na moth was poor Cradell. There was no warmth to be got by him\r\nfrom that flame. There was no beauty in the light,--not even the\r\nfalse brilliance of unhallowed love. Injury might come to him,--a\r\npernicious clipping of the wings, which might destroy all power of\r\nfuture flight; injury, and not improbably destruction, if he should\r\npersevere. But one may say that no single hour of happiness could\r\naccrue to him from his intimacy with Mrs. Lupex. He felt for her no\r\nlove. He was afraid of her, and, in many respects, disliked her.\r\nBut to him, in his moth-like weakness, ignorance, and blindness, it\r\nseemed to be a great thing that he should be allowed to fly near the\r\ncandle. Oh! my friends, if you will but think of it, how many of you\r\nhave been moths, and are now going about ungracefully with wings more\r\nor less burnt off, and with bodies sadly scorched!\r\n\r\nBut before Mr. Cradell could make up his mind whether or no he would\r\ntake advantage of the present opportunity for another dip into\r\nthe flame of the candle,--in regard to which proceeding, however,\r\nhe could not but feel that the presence of Miss Spruce was\r\nobjectionable,--the door of the room was opened, and Amelia Roper\r\njoined the party.\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed; Mrs. Lupex," she said. "And Mr. Cradell!"\r\n\r\n"And Miss Spruce, my dear," said Mrs. Lupex, pointing to the ancient\r\nlady.\r\n\r\n"I\'m only an old woman," said Miss Spruce.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I see Miss Spruce," said Amelia. "I was not hinting at\r\nanything, I can assure you."\r\n\r\n"I should think not, my dear," said Mrs. Lupex.\r\n\r\n"Only I didn\'t know that you two were quite-- That is, when last I\r\nheard about it, I fancied-- But if the quarrel\'s made up, there\'s\r\nnobody more rejoiced than I am."\r\n\r\n"The quarrel is made up," said Cradell.\r\n\r\n"If Mr. Lupex is satisfied, I\'m sure I am," said Amelia.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Lupex is satisfied," said Mrs. Lupex; "and let me tell you, my\r\ndear, seeing that you are expecting to get married yourself--"\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Lupex, I\'m not expecting to get married,--not particularly, by\r\nany means."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I thought you were. And let me tell you, that when you\'ve got\r\na husband of your own, you won\'t find it so easy to keep everything\r\nstraight. That\'s the worst of these lodgings; if there is any little\r\nthing, everybody knows it. Don\'t they, Miss Spruce?"\r\n\r\n"Lodgings is so much more comfortable than housekeeping," said Miss\r\nSpruce, who lived rather in fear of her relatives, the Ropers.\r\n\r\n"Everybody knows it; does he?" said Amelia. "Why, if a gentleman will\r\ncome home at night tipsy and threaten to murder another gentleman in\r\nthe same house; and if a lady--" And then Amelia paused, for she knew\r\nthat the line-of-battle ship which she was preparing to encounter had\r\nwithin her much power of fighting.\r\n\r\n"Well, miss," said Mrs. Lupex, getting on her feet, "and what of the\r\nlady?"\r\n\r\nNow we may say that the battle had begun, and that the two ships were\r\npledged by the general laws of courage and naval warfare to maintain\r\nthe contest till one of them should be absolutely disabled, if not\r\nblown up or sunk. And at this moment it might be difficult for a\r\nbystander to say with which of the combatants rested the better\r\nchance of permanent success. Mrs. Lupex had doubtless on her side\r\nmore matured power, a habit of fighting which had given her infinite\r\nskill, a courage which deadened her to the feeling of all wounds\r\nwhile the heat of the battle should last, and a recklessness which\r\nmade her almost indifferent whether she sank or swam. But then Amelia\r\ncarried the greater guns, and was able to pour in heavier metal than\r\nher enemy could use; and she, too, swam in her own waters. Should\r\nthey absolutely come to grappling and boarding, Amelia would no doubt\r\nhave the best of it; but Mrs. Lupex would probably be too crafty to\r\npermit such a proceeding as that. She was, however, ready for the\r\noccasion, and greedy for the fight.\r\n\r\n"And what of the lady?" said she, in a tone of voice that admitted of\r\nno pacific rejoinder.\r\n\r\n"A lady, if she is a lady," said Amelia, "will know how to behave\r\nherself."\r\n\r\n"And you\'re going to teach me, are you, Miss Roper? I\'m sure I\'m ever\r\nso much obliged to you. It\'s Manchester manners, I suppose, that you\r\nprefer?"\r\n\r\n"I prefer honest manners, Mrs. Lupex, and decent manners, and manners\r\nthat won\'t shock a whole house full of people; and I don\'t care\r\nwhether they come from Manchester or London."\r\n\r\n"Milliner\'s manners, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care whether they are milliner\'s manners or theatrical, Mrs.\r\nLupex, as long as they\'re not downright bad manners--as yours are,\r\nMrs. Lupex. And now you\'ve got it. What are you going on for in\r\nthis way with that young man, till you\'ll drive your husband into a\r\nmadhouse with drink and jealousy?"\r\n\r\n"Miss Roper! Miss Roper!" said Cradell; "now really--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t mind her, Mr. Cradell," said Mrs. Lupex; "she\'s not worthy\r\nfor you to speak to. And as to that poor fellow Eames, if you\'ve any\r\nfriendship for him, you\'ll let him know what she is. My dear, how\'s\r\nMr. Juniper, of Grogram\'s house, at Salford? I know all about you,\r\nand so shall John Eames, too--poor unfortunate fool of a fellow!\r\nTelling me of drink and jealousy, indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, telling you! And now you\'ve, mentioned Mr. Juniper\'s name, Mr.\r\nEames, and Mr. Cradell too, may know the whole of it. There\'s been\r\nnothing about Mr. Juniper that I\'m ashamed of."\r\n\r\n"It would be difficult to make you ashamed of anything, I believe."\r\n\r\n"But let me tell you this, Mrs. Lupex, you\'re not going to destroy\r\nthe respectability of this house by your goings on."\r\n\r\n"It was a bad day for me when I let Lupex bring me into it."\r\n\r\n"Then pay your bill, and walk out of it," said Amelia, waving her\r\nhand towards the door. "I\'ll undertake to say there shan\'t be any\r\nnotice required. Only you pay mother what you owe, and you\'re free to\r\ngo at once."\r\n\r\n"I shall go just when I please, and not one hour before. Who are you,\r\nyou gipsy, to speak to me in this way?"\r\n\r\n"And as for going, go you shall, if we have to call in the police to\r\nmake you."\r\n\r\nAmelia, as at this period of the fight she stood fronting her foe\r\nwith her arms akimbo, certainly seemed to have the best of the\r\nbattle. But the bitterness of Mrs. Lupex\'s tongue had hardly yet\r\nproduced its greatest results. I am inclined to think that the\r\nmarried lady would have silenced her who was single, had the\r\nfight been allowed to rage,--always presuming that no resort to\r\ngrappling-irons took place. But at this moment Mrs. Roper entered the\r\nroom, accompanied by her son, and both the combatants for a moment\r\nretreated.\r\n\r\n"Amelia, what\'s all this?" said Mrs. Roper, trying to assume a look\r\nof agonized amazement.\r\n\r\n"Ask Mrs. Lupex," said Amelia.\r\n\r\n"And Mrs. Lupex will answer," said that lady. "Your daughter has come\r\nin here, and attacked me--in such language--before Mr. Cradell,\r\ntoo--"\r\n\r\n"Why doesn\'t she pay what she owes, and leave the house?" said\r\nAmelia.\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue," said her brother. "What she owes is no affair of\r\nyours."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s an affair of mine, when I\'m insulted by such a creature as\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Creature!" said Mrs. Lupex. "I\'d like to know which is most like\r\na creature! But I\'ll tell you, what it is, Amelia Roper--" Here,\r\nhowever, her eloquence was stopped, for Amelia had disappeared\r\nthrough the door, having been pushed out of the room by her brother.\r\nWhereupon Mrs. Lupex, having found a sofa convenient for the service,\r\nbetook herself to hysterics. There for the moment we will leave her,\r\nhoping that poor Mrs. Roper was not kept late out of her bed.\r\n\r\n"What a deuce of a mess Eames will make of it if he marries that\r\ngirl!" Such was Cradell\'s reflection as he betook himself to his own\r\nroom. But of his own part in the night\'s transactions he was rather\r\nproud than otherwise, feeling that the married lady\'s regard for him\r\nhad been the cause of the battle which had raged. So, likewise, did\r\nParis derive much gratification from the ten years\' siege of Troy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nLILIAN DALE BECOMES A BUTTERFLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now we will go back to Allington. The same morning that brought\r\nto John Eames the two letters which were given in the last chapter\r\nbut one, brought to the Great House, among others, the following\r\nepistle for Adolphus Crosbie. It was from a countess, and was written\r\non pink paper, beautifully creamlaid and scented, ornamented with a\r\ncoronet and certain singularly-entwined initials. Altogether, the\r\nletter was very fashionable and attractive, and Adolphus Crosbie was\r\nby no means sorry to receive it.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Courcy Castle, September, 186--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MR. CROSBIE,--We have heard of you from the\r\n   Gazebees, who have come down to us, and who tell us that\r\n   you are rusticating at a charming little village, in\r\n   which, among other attractions, there are wood nymphs and\r\n   water nymphs, to whom much of your time is devoted. As\r\n   this is just the thing for your taste, I would not for\r\n   worlds disturb you; but if you should ever tear yourself\r\n   away from the groves and fountains of Allington, we shall\r\n   be delighted to welcome you here, though you will find us\r\n   very unromantic after your late Elysium.\r\n\r\n   Lady Dumbello is coming to us, who I know is a favourite\r\n   of yours. Or is it the other way, and are you a favourite\r\n   of hers? I did ask Lady Hartletop, but she cannot get away\r\n   from the poor marquis, who is, you know, so very infirm.\r\n   The duke isn\'t at Gatherum at present, but, of course,\r\n   I don\'t mean that that has anything to do with dear Lady\r\n   Hartletop\'s not coming to us. I believe we shall have the\r\n   house full, and shall not want for nymphs either, though\r\n   I fear they will not be of the wood and water kind.\r\n   Margaretta and Alexandrina particularly want you to come,\r\n   as they say you are so clever at making a houseful of\r\n   people go off well If you can give us a week before you go\r\n   back to manage the affairs of the nation, pray do.\r\n\r\n   Yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\n   ROSINA DE COURCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Countess De Courcy was a very old friend of Mr. Crosbie\'s; that\r\nis to say, as old friends go in the world in which he had been\r\nliving. He had known her for the last six or seven years, and had\r\nbeen in the habit of going to all her London balls, and dancing with\r\nher daughters everywhere, in a most good-natured and affable way.\r\nHe had been intimate, from old family relations, with Mr. Mortimer\r\nGazebee, who, though only an attorney of the more distinguished kind,\r\nhad married the countess\'s eldest daughter, and now sat in Parliament\r\nfor the city of Barchester, near to which Courcy Castle was situated.\r\nAnd, to tell the truth honestly at once, Mr. Crosbie had been on\r\nterms of great friendship with Lady De Courcy\'s daughters, the Ladies\r\nMargaretta and Alexandrina--perhaps especially so with the latter,\r\nthough I would not have my readers suppose by my saying so that\r\nanything more tender than friendship had ever existed between them.\r\n\r\nCrosbie said nothing about the letter on that morning; but during the\r\nday, or, perhaps, as he thought over the matter in bed, he made up\r\nhis mind that he would accept Lady De Courcy\'s invitation. It was not\r\nonly that he would be glad to see the Gazebees, or glad to stay in\r\nthe same house with that great master in the high art of fashionable\r\nlife, Lady Dumbello, or glad to renew his friendship with the Ladies\r\nMargaretta and Alexandrina. Had he felt that the circumstances of his\r\nengagement with Lily made it expedient for him to stay with her till\r\nthe end of his holidays, he could have thrown over the De Courcys\r\nwithout a struggle. But he told himself that it would be well for him\r\nnow to tear himself away from Lily; or perhaps he said that it would\r\nbe well for Lily that he should be torn away. He must not teach her\r\nto think that they were to live only in the sunlight of each other\'s\r\neyes during those months, or perhaps years, which must elapse before\r\ntheir engagement could be carried out. Nor must he allow her to\r\nsuppose that either he or she were to depend solely upon the other\r\nfor the amusements and employments of life. In this way he argued the\r\nmatter very sensibly within his own mind, and resolved, without much\r\ndifficulty, that he would go to Courcy Castle, and bask for a week in\r\nthe sunlight of the fashion which would be collected there. The quiet\r\nhumdrum of his own fireside would come upon him soon enough!\r\n\r\n"I think I shall leave you on Wednesday, sir," Crosbie said to the\r\nsquire at breakfast on Sunday morning.\r\n\r\n"Leave us on Wednesday!" said the squire, who had an old-fashioned\r\nidea that people who were engaged to marry each other should remain\r\ntogether as long as circumstances could be made to admit of their\r\ndoing so. "Nothing wrong, is there?"\r\n\r\n"O dear, no! But everything must come to an end some day; and as I\r\nmust make one or two short visits before I get back to town, I might\r\nas well go on Wednesday. Indeed, I have made it as late as I possibly\r\ncould."\r\n\r\n"Where do you go from here?" asked Bernard.\r\n\r\n"Well, as it happens, only into the next county,--to Courcy Castle."\r\nAnd then there was nothing more said about the matter at that\r\nbreakfast-table.\r\n\r\nIt had become their habit to meet together on the Sunday mornings\r\nbefore church, on the lawn belonging to the Small House, and on this\r\nday the three gentlemen walked down together, and found Lily and Bell\r\nalready waiting for them. They generally had some few minutes to\r\nspare on those occasions before Mrs. Dale summoned them to pass\r\nthrough the house to church, and such was the case at present. The\r\nsquire at these times would stand in the middle of the grass-plot,\r\nsurveying his grounds, and taking stock of the shrubs, and flowers,\r\nand fruit-trees round him; for he never forgot that it was all his\r\nown, and would thus use this opportunity, as he seldom came down\r\nto see the spot on other days. Mrs. Dale, as she would see him\r\nfrom her own window while she was tying on her bonnet, would feel\r\nthat she knew what was passing through his mind, and would regret\r\nthat circumstances had forced her to be beholden to him for such\r\nassistance. But, in truth, she did not know all that he thought at\r\nsuch times. "It is mine," he would say to himself, as he looked\r\naround on the pleasant place. "But it is well for me that they should\r\nenjoy it. She is my brother\'s widow, and she is welcome;--very\r\nwelcome." I think that if those two persons had known more than they\r\ndid of each other\'s hearts and minds they might have loved each other\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nAnd then Crosbie told Lily of his intention. "On Wednesday!" she\r\nsaid, turning almost pale with emotion as she heard this news. He had\r\ntold her abruptly, not thinking, probably, that such tidings would\r\naffect her so strongly.\r\n\r\n"Well, yes. I have written to Lady De Courcy and said Wednesday. It\r\nwouldn\'t do for me exactly to drop everybody, and perhaps--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no! And, Adolphus, you don\'t suppose I begrudge your going. Only\r\nit does seem so sudden; does it not?"\r\n\r\n"You see, I\'ve been here over six weeks."\r\n\r\n"Yes; you\'ve been very good. When I think of it, what a six weeks it\r\nhas been! I wonder whether the difference seems to you as great as it\r\ndoes to me. I\'ve left off being a grub, and begun to be a butterfly."\r\n\r\n"But you mustn\'t be a butterfly when you\'re married, Lily."\r\n\r\n"No; not in that sense. But I meant that my real position in the\r\nworld,--that for which I would fain hope that I was created,--opened\r\nto me only when I knew you and knew that you loved me. But mamma is\r\ncalling us, and we must go through to church. Going on Wednesday!\r\nThere are only three days more, then!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, just three days," he said, as he took her on his arm and passed\r\nthrough the house on to the road.\r\n\r\n"And when are we to see you again?" she asked, as they reached the\r\nchurchyard.\r\n\r\n"Ah, who is to say that yet? We must ask the Chairman of Committees\r\nwhen he will let me go again." Then there was nothing more said, and\r\nthey all followed the squire through the little porch and up to the\r\nbig family-pew in which they all sat. Here the squire took his place\r\nin one special corner which he had occupied ever since his father\'s\r\ndeath, and from which he read the responses loudly and plainly,--so\r\nloudly and plainly, that the parish clerk could by no means equal\r\nhim, though with emulous voice he still made the attempt. "T\'\r\nsquire\'d like to be squire, and parson, and clerk, and everything; so\r\na would," the poor clerk would say, when complaining of the ill-usage\r\nwhich he suffered.\r\n\r\nIf Lily\'s prayers were interrupted by her new sorrow, I think that\r\nher fault in that respect would be forgiven. Of course she had known\r\nthat Crosbie was not going to remain at Allington much longer. She\r\nknew quite as well as he did the exact day on which his leave of\r\nabsence came to its end, and the hour at which it behoved him to\r\nwalk into his room at the General Committee Office. She had taught\r\nherself to think that he would remain with them up to the end of his\r\nvacation, and now she felt as a schoolboy would feel who was told\r\nsuddenly, a day or two before the time, that the last week of his\r\nholidays was to be taken from him. The grievance would have been\r\nslight had she known it from the first; but what schoolboy could\r\nstand such a shock, when the loss amounted to two-thirds of his\r\nremaining wealth? Lily did not blame her lover. She did not even\r\nthink that he ought to stay. She would not allow herself to suppose\r\nthat he could propose anything that was unkind. But she felt her\r\nloss, and more than once, as she knelt at her prayers, she wiped a\r\nhidden tear from her eyes.\r\n\r\nCrosbie also was thinking of his departure more than he should have\r\ndone during Mr. Boyce\'s sermon. "It\'s easy listening to him," Mrs.\r\nHearn used to say of her husband\'s successor. "It don\'t give one much\r\ntrouble following him into his arguments." Mr. Crosbie perhaps found\r\nthe difficulty greater than did Mrs. Hearn, and would have devoted\r\nhis mind more perfectly to the discourse had the argument been\r\ndeeper. It is very hard, that necessity of listening to a man\r\nwho says nothing. On this occasion Crosbie ignored the necessity\r\naltogether, and gave up his mind to the consideration of what it\r\nmight be expedient that he should say to Lily before he went. He\r\nremembered well those few words which he had spoken in the first\r\nardour of his love, pleading that an early day might be fixed for\r\ntheir marriage. And he remembered, also, how prettily Lily had\r\nyielded to him. "Only do not let it be too soon," she had said.\r\nNow he must unsay what he had then said. He must plead against his\r\nown pleadings, and explain to her that he desired to postpone the\r\nmarriage rather than to hasten it--a task which, I presume, must\r\nalways be an unpleasant one for any man engaged to be married. "I\r\nmight as well do it at once," he said to himself, as he bobbed his\r\nhead forward into his hands by way of returning thanks for the\r\ntermination of Mr. Boyce\'s sermon.\r\n\r\nAs he had only three days left, it was certainly as well that he\r\nshould do this at once. Seeing that Lily had no fortune, she could\r\nnot in justice complain of a prolonged engagement. That was the\r\nargument which he used in his own mind. But he as often told himself\r\nthat she would have very great ground of complaint if she were left\r\nfor a day unnecessarily in doubt as to this matter. Why had he rashly\r\nspoken those hasty words to her in his love, betraying himself into\r\nall manner of scrapes, as a schoolboy might do, or such a one as\r\nJohnny Eames? What an ass he had been not to have remembered himself\r\nand to have been collected,--not to have bethought himself on the\r\noccasion of all that might be due to Adolphus Crosbie! And then\r\nthe idea came upon him whether he had not altogether made himself\r\nan ass in this matter. And as he gave his arm to Lily outside the\r\nchurch-door, he shrugged his shoulders while making that reflection.\r\n"It is too late now," he said to himself; and then turned round\r\nand made some sweet little loving speech to her. Adolphus Crosbie\r\nwas a clever man; and he meant also to be a true man,--if only the\r\ntemptations to falsehood might not be too great for him.\r\n\r\n"Lily," he said to her, "will you walk in the fields after lunch?"\r\n\r\nWalk in the fields with him! Of course she would. There were only\r\nthree days left, and would she not give up to him every moment of her\r\ntime, if he would accept of all her moments? And then they lunched at\r\nthe Small House, Mrs. Dale having promised to join the dinner-party\r\nat the squire\'s table. The squire did not eat any lunch, excusing\r\nhimself on the plea that lunch in itself was a bad thing. "He can eat\r\nlunch at his own house," Mrs. Dale afterwards said to Bell. "And I\'ve\r\noften seen him take a glass of sherry." While thinking of this, Mrs.\r\nDale made her own dinner. If her brother-in-law would not eat at her\r\nboard, neither would she eat at his.\r\n\r\nAnd then in a few minutes Lily had on her hat, in place of that\r\ndecorous, church-going bonnet which Crosbie was wont to abuse with\r\na lover\'s privilege, feeling well assured that he might say what\r\nhe liked of the bonnet as long as he would praise the hat. "Only\r\nthree days," she said, as she walked down with him across the\r\nlawn at a quick pace. But she said it in a voice which made no\r\ncomplaint,--which seemed to say simply this,--that as the good\r\ntime was to be so short, they must make the most of it. And what\r\ncompliment could be paid to a man so sweet as that? What flattery\r\ncould be more gratifying? All my earthly heaven is with you; and now,\r\nfor the delight of these immediately present months or so, there are\r\nleft to me but three days of this heaven! Come, then; I will make the\r\nmost of what happiness is given to me. Crosbie felt it all as she\r\nfelt it, and recognized the extent of the debt he owed her. "I\'ll\r\ncome down to them for a day at Christmas, though it be only for a\r\nday," he said to himself. Then he reflected that as such was his\r\nintention, it might be well for him to open his present conversation\r\nwith a promise to that effect.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Lily; there are only three days left now. But I wonder\r\nwhether--I suppose you\'ll all be at home at Christmas?"\r\n\r\n"At home at Christmas?--of course we shall be at home. You don\'t mean\r\nto say you\'ll come to us!"\r\n\r\n"Well; I think I will, if you\'ll have me."\r\n\r\n"Oh! that will make such a difference. Let me see. That will only be\r\nthree months. And to have you here on Christmas Day! I would sooner\r\nhave you then than on any other day in the year."\r\n\r\n"It will only be for one day, Lily. I shall come to dinner on\r\nChristmas Eve, and must go away the day after."\r\n\r\n"But you will come direct to our house!"\r\n\r\n"If you can spare me a room."\r\n\r\n"Of course we can. So we could now. Only when you came, you know--"\r\nThen she looked up into his face and smiled.\r\n\r\n"When I came, I was the squire\'s friend and your cousin\'s, rather\r\nthan yours. But that\'s all changed now."\r\n\r\n"Yes; you\'re my friend now,--mine specially. I\'m to be now and always\r\nyour own special, dearest friend;--eh, Adolphus?" And then she\r\nexacted from him the repetition of the promise which he had so often\r\ngiven her.\r\n\r\nBy this time they had passed through the grounds of the Great House\r\nand were in the fields. "Lily," said he, speaking rather suddenly,\r\nand making her feel by his manner that something of importance was\r\nto be said; "I want to say a few words to you about,--business." And\r\nhe gave a little laugh as he spoke the last word, making her fully\r\nunderstand that he was not quite at his ease.\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'ll listen. And, Adolphus, pray don\'t be afraid about\r\nme. What I mean is, don\'t think that I can\'t bear cares and troubles.\r\nI can bear anything as long as you love me. I say that because I\'m\r\nafraid I seemed to complain about your going. I didn\'t mean to."\r\n\r\n"I never thought you complained, dearest. Nothing can be better than\r\nyou are at all times and in every way. A man would be very hard to\r\nplease if you didn\'t please him."\r\n\r\n"If I can only please you--"\r\n\r\n"You do please me, in everything. Dear Lily, I think I found an angel\r\nwhen I found you. But now about this business. Perhaps I\'d better\r\ntell you everything."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, tell me everything."\r\n\r\n"But then you mustn\'t misunderstand me. And if I talk about money,\r\nyou mustn\'t suppose that it has anything to do with my love for you."\r\n\r\n"I wish for your sake that I wasn\'t such a little pauper."\r\n\r\n"What I mean to say is this, that if I seem to be anxious about\r\nmoney, you must not suppose that that anxiety bears any reference\r\nwhatever to my affection for you. I should love you just the same,\r\nand look forward just as much to my happiness in marrying you,\r\nwhether you were rich or poor. You understand that?"\r\n\r\nShe did not quite understand him; but she merely pressed his arm,\r\nso as to encourage him to go on. She presumed that he intended to\r\ntell her something as to their future mode of life--something which\r\nhe supposed it might not be pleasant for her to hear, and she was\r\ndetermined to show him that she would receive it pleasantly.\r\n\r\n"You know," said he, "how anxious I have been that our marriage\r\nshould not be delayed. To me, of course, it must be everything now\r\nto call you my own as soon as possible." In answer to which little\r\ndeclaration of love, she merely pressed his arm again, the subject\r\nbeing one on which she had not herself much to say.\r\n\r\n"Of course I must be very anxious, but I find it not so easy as I\r\nexpected."\r\n\r\n"You know what I said, Adolphus. I said that I thought we had better\r\nwait. I\'m sure mamma thinks so. And if we can only see you now and\r\nthen--"\r\n\r\n"That will be a matter of course. But, as I was saying-- Let me see.\r\nYes,--all that waiting will be intolerable to me. It is such a bore\r\nfor a man when he has made up his mind on such a matter as marriage,\r\nnot to make the change at once, especially when he is going to take\r\nto himself such a little angel as you are," and as he spoke these\r\nloving words, his arm was again put round her waist; "but--" and then\r\nhe stopped. He wanted to make her understand that this change of\r\nintention on his part was caused by the unexpected misconduct of her\r\nuncle. He desired that she should know exactly how the matter stood;\r\nthat he had been led to suppose that her uncle would give her some\r\nsmall fortune; that he had been disappointed, and had a right to feel\r\nthe disappointment keenly; and that in consequence of this blow to\r\nhis expectations, he must put off his marriage. But he wished her\r\nalso to understand at the same time that this did not in the least\r\nmar his love for her; that he did not join her at all in her uncle\'s\r\nfault. All this he was anxious to convey to her, but he did not know\r\nhow to get it said in a manner that would not be offensive to her\r\npersonally, and that should not appear to accuse himself of sordid\r\nmotives. He had begun by declaring that he would tell her all; but\r\nsometimes it is not easy, that task of telling a person everything.\r\nThere are things which will not get themselves told.\r\n\r\n"You mean, dearest," said she, "that you cannot afford to marry at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\n"Yes; that is it. I had expected that I should be able, but--"\r\n\r\nDid any man in love ever yet find himself able to tell the lady whom\r\nhe loved that he was very much disappointed on discovering that she\r\nhad got no money? If so, his courage, I should say, was greater than\r\nhis love. Crosbie found himself unable to do it, and thought himself\r\ncruelly used because of the difficulty. The delay to which he\r\nintended to subject her was occasioned, as he felt, by the squire,\r\nand not by himself. He was ready to do his part, if only the squire\r\nhad been willing to do the part which properly belonged to him. The\r\nsquire would not; and, therefore, neither could he,--not as yet.\r\nJustice demanded that all this should be understood; but when he came\r\nto the telling of it, he found that the story would not form itself\r\nproperly. He must let the thing go, and bear the injustice, consoling\r\nhimself as best he might by the reflection that he at least was\r\nbehaving well in the matter.\r\n\r\n"It won\'t make me unhappy, Adolphus."\r\n\r\n"Will it not?" said he. "As regards myself, I own that I cannot bear\r\nthe delay with so much indifference."\r\n\r\n"Nay, my love; but you should not misunderstand me," she said,\r\nstopping and facing him on the path in which they were walking. "I\r\nsuppose I ought to protest, according to the common rules, that I\r\nwould rather wait. Young ladies are expected to say so. If you were\r\npressing me to marry at once, I should say so, no doubt. But now, as\r\nit is, I will be more honest. I have only one wish in the world, and\r\nthat is, to be your wife,--to be able to share everything with you.\r\nThe sooner we can be together the better it will be,--at any rate,\r\nfor me. There; will that satisfy you?"\r\n\r\n"My own, own Lily!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, your own Lily. You shall have no cause to doubt me, dearest.\r\nBut I do not expect that I am to have everything exactly as I want\r\nit. I say again, that I shall not be unhappy in waiting. How can I be\r\nunhappy while I feel certain of your love? I was disappointed just\r\nnow when you said that you were going so soon; and I am afraid I\r\nshowed it. But those little things are more unendurable than the big\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n"Yes; that\'s very true."\r\n\r\n"But there are three more days, and I mean to enjoy them so much! And\r\nthen you will write to me: and you will come at Christmas. And next\r\nyear, when you have your holiday, you will come down to us again;\r\nwill you not?"\r\n\r\n"You may be quite sure of that."\r\n\r\n"And so the time will go by till it suits you to come and take me. I\r\nshall not be unhappy."\r\n\r\n"I, at any rate, shall be impatient."\r\n\r\n"Ah, men always are impatient. It is one of their privileges, I\r\nsuppose. And I don\'t think that a man ever has the same positive\r\nand complete satisfaction in knowing that he is loved, which a girl\r\nfeels. You are my bird that I have shot with my own gun; and the\r\nassurance of my success is sufficient for my happiness."\r\n\r\n"You have bowled me over, and know that I can\'t get up again."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about can\'t. I would let you up quick enough, if you\r\nwished it."\r\n\r\nHow he made his loving assurance that he did not wish it, never would\r\nor could wish it, the reader will readily understand. And then he\r\nconsidered that he might as well leave all those money questions as\r\nthey now stood. His real object had been to convince her that their\r\njoint circumstances did not admit of an immediate marriage; and as to\r\nthat she completely understood him. Perhaps, during the next three\r\ndays, some opportunity might arise for explaining the whole matter to\r\nMrs. Dale. At any rate, he had declared his own purpose honestly, and\r\nno one could complain of him.\r\n\r\nOn the following day they all rode over to Guestwick together,--the\r\nall consisting of the two girls, with Bernard and Crosbie. Their\r\nobject was to pay two visits,--one to their very noble and highly\r\nexalted ally, the Lady Julia De Guest; and the other to their much\r\nhumbler and better known friend, Mrs. Eames. As Guestwick Manor lay\r\non their road into the town, they performed the grander ceremony the\r\nfirst. The present Earl De Guest, brother of that Lady Fanny who ran\r\naway with Major Dale, was an unmarried nobleman, who devoted himself\r\nchiefly to the breeding of cattle. And as he bred very good cattle,\r\ntaking infinite satisfaction in the employment, devoting all his\r\nenergies thereto, and abstaining from all prominently evil courses,\r\nit should be acknowledged that he was not a bad member of society.\r\nHe was a thorough-going old Tory, whose proxy was always in the hand\r\nof the leader of his party; and who seldom himself went near the\r\nmetropolis, unless called thither by some occasion of cattle-showing.\r\nHe was a short, stumpy man, with red cheeks and a round face; who\r\nwas usually to be seen till dinner-time dressed in a very old\r\nshooting coat, with breeches, gaiters, and very thick shoes. He lived\r\ngenerally out of doors, and was almost as great in the preserving\r\nof game as in the breeding of oxen. He knew every acre of his own\r\nestate, and every tree upon it, as thoroughly as a lady knows the\r\nornaments in her drawing-room. There was no gap in a fence of which\r\nhe did not remember the exact bearings, no path hither or thither as\r\nto which he could not tell the why and the wherefore. He had been\r\nin his earlier years a poor man as regarded his income,--very poor,\r\nseeing that he was an earl. But he was not at present by any means an\r\nimpoverished man, having been taught a lesson by the miseries of his\r\nfather and grandfather, and having learned to live within his means.\r\nNow, as he was going down the vale of years, men said that he was\r\nbecoming rich, and that he had ready money to spend,--a position in\r\nwhich no Lord De Guest had found himself for many generations back.\r\nHis father and grandfather had been known as spendthrifts; and now\r\nmen said that this earl was a miser.\r\n\r\nThere was not much of nobility in his appearance; but they greatly\r\nmistook Lord De Guest who conceived that on that account his pride of\r\nplace was not dear to his soul. His peerage dated back to the time of\r\nKing John, and there were but three lords in England whose patents\r\nhad been conferred before his own. He knew what privileges were due\r\nto him on behalf of his blood, and was not disposed to abate one\r\njot of them. He was not loud in demanding them. As he went through\r\nthe world he sent no trumpeters to the right or left, proclaiming\r\nthat the Earl De Guest was coming. When he spread his board for his\r\nfriends, which he did but on rare occasions, he entertained them\r\nsimply, with a mild, tedious, old-fashioned courtesy. We may say\r\nthat, if properly treated, the earl never walked over anybody. But he\r\ncould, if ill-treated, be grandly indignant; and if attacked, could\r\nhold his own against all the world. He knew himself to be every\r\ninch an earl, pottering about after his oxen with his muddy gaiters\r\nand red cheeks, as much as though he were glittering with stars in\r\ncourtly royal ceremonies among his peers at Westminster;--ay, more an\r\nearl than any of those who use their nobility for pageant purposes.\r\nWoe be to him who should mistake that old coat for a badge of rural\r\ndegradation! Now and again some unlucky wight did make such a\r\nmistake, and had to do his penance very uncomfortably.\r\n\r\nWith the earl lived a maiden sister, the Lady Julia. Bernard Dale\'s\r\nfather had, in early life, run away with one sister, but no suitor\r\nhad been fortunate enough to induce the Lady Julia to run with him.\r\nTherefore she still lived, in maiden blessedness, as mistress of\r\nGuestwick Manor; and as such had no mean opinion of the high position\r\nwhich destiny had called upon her to fill. She was a tedious, dull,\r\nvirtuous old woman, who gave herself infinite credit for having\r\nremained all her days in the home of her youth, probably forgetting,\r\nin her present advanced years, that her temptations to leave it had\r\nnot been strong or numerous. She generally spoke of her sister Fanny\r\nwith some little contempt, as though that poor lady had degraded\r\nherself in marrying a younger brother. She was as proud of her own\r\nposition as was the earl her brother, but her pride was maintained\r\nwith more of outward show and less of inward nobility. It was hardly\r\nenough for her that the world should know that she was a De Guest,\r\nand therefore she had assumed little pompous ways and certain airs of\r\ncondescension which did not make her popular with her neighbours.\r\n\r\nThe intercourse between Guestwick Manor and Allington was not very\r\nfrequent or very cordial. Soon after the running away of the Lady\r\nFanny, the two families had agreed to acknowledge their connection\r\nwith each other, and to let it be known by the world that they were\r\non friendly terms. Either that course was necessary to them, or\r\nthe other course, of letting it be known that they were enemies.\r\nFriendship was the less troublesome, and therefore the two families\r\ncalled on each other from time to time, and gave each other dinners\r\nabout once a year. The earl regarded the squire as a man who had\r\ndeserted his politics, and had thereby forfeited the respect due\r\nto him as an hereditary land magnate; and the squire was wont to\r\nbe-little the earl as one who understood nothing of the outer world.\r\nAt Guestwick Manor Bernard was to some extent a favourite. He was\r\nactually a relative, having in his veins blood of the De Guests, and\r\nwas not the less a favourite because he was the heir to Allington,\r\nand because the blood of the Dales was older even than that of the\r\nnoble family to which he was allied. When Bernard should come to be\r\nthe squire, then indeed there might be cordial relations between\r\nGuestwick Manor and Allington; unless, indeed, the earl\'s heir and\r\nthe squire\'s heir should have some fresh cause of ill-will between\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThey found Lady Julia sitting in her drawing-room alone, and\r\nintroduced to her Mr. Crosbie in due form. The fact of Lily\'s\r\nengagement was of course known at the manor, and it was quite\r\nunderstood that her intended husband was now brought over that he\r\nmight be looked at and approved. Lady Julia made a very elaborate\r\ncurtsey, and expressed a hope that her young friend might be made\r\nhappy in that sphere of life to which it had pleased God to call her.\r\n\r\n"I hope I shall, Lady Julia," said Lily, with a little laugh; "at any\r\nrate I mean to try."\r\n\r\n"We all try, my dear, but many of us fail to try with sufficient\r\nenergy of purpose. It is only by doing our duty that we can hope to\r\nbe happy, whether in single life or in married."\r\n\r\n"Miss Dale means to be a dragon of perfection in the performance of\r\nhers," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"A dragon!" said Lady Julia. "No; I hope Miss Lily Dale will never\r\nbecome a dragon." And then she turned to her nephew. It may be as\r\nwell to say at once that she never forgave Mr. Crosbie the freedom of\r\nthe expression which he had used. He had been in the drawing-room of\r\nGuestwick Manor for two minutes only, and it did not become him to\r\ntalk about dragons. "Bernard," she said, "I heard from your mother\r\nyesterday. I am afraid she does not seem to be very strong." And then\r\nthere was a little conversation, not very interesting in its nature,\r\nbetween the aunt and the nephew as to the general health of Lady\r\nFanny.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know my aunt was so unwell," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"She isn\'t ill," said Bernard. "She never is ill; but then she is\r\nnever well."\r\n\r\n"Your aunt," said Lady Julia, seeming to put a touch of sarcasm into\r\nthe tone of her voice as she repeated the word--"your aunt has never\r\nenjoyed good health since she left this house; but that is a long\r\ntime ago."\r\n\r\n"A very long time," said Crosbie, who was not accustomed to be left\r\nin his chair silent. "You, Dale, at any rate, can hardly remember\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"But I can remember it," said Lady Julia, gathering herself up. "I\r\ncan remember when my sister Fanny was recognized as the beauty of the\r\ncountry. It is a dangerous gift, that of beauty."\r\n\r\n"Very dangerous," said Crosbie. Then Lily laughed again, and Lady\r\nJulia became more angry than ever. What odious man was this whom her\r\nneighbours were going to take into their very bosom! But she had\r\nheard of Mr. Crosbie before, and Mr. Crosbie also had heard of her.\r\n\r\n"By-the-by, Lady Julia," said he, "I think I know some very dear\r\nfriends of yours."\r\n\r\n"Very dear friends is a very strong word. I have not many very dear\r\nfriends."\r\n\r\n"I mean the Gazebees. I have heard Mortimer Gazebee and Lady Amelia\r\nspeak of you."\r\n\r\nWhereupon Lady Julia confessed that she did know the Gazebees. Mr.\r\nGazebee, she said, was a man who in early life had wanted many\r\nadvantages, but still he was a very estimable person. He was now in\r\nParliament, and she understood that he was making himself useful. She\r\nhad not quite approved of Lady Amelia\'s marriage at the time, and\r\nso she had told her very old friend Lady De Courcy; but-- And then\r\nLady Julia said many words in praise of Mr. Gazebee, which seemed to\r\namount to this; that he was an excellent sort of man, with a full\r\nconviction of the too great honour done to him by the earl\'s daughter\r\nwho had married him, and a complete consciousness that even that\r\nmarriage had not put him on a par with his wife\'s relations, or even\r\nwith his wife. And then it came out that Lady Julia in the course of\r\nthe next week was going to meet the Gazebees at Courcy Castle.\r\n\r\n"I am delighted to think that I shall have the pleasure of seeing you\r\nthere," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" said Lady Julia.\r\n\r\n"I am going to Courcy on Wednesday. That, I fear, will be too early\r\nto allow of my being of any service to your ladyship."\r\n\r\nLady Julia drew herself up, and declined the escort which Mr. Crosbie\r\nhad seemed to offer. It grieved her to find that Lily Dale\'s future\r\nhusband was an intimate friend of her friend\'s, and it especially\r\ngrieved her to find that he was now going to that friend\'s house.\r\nIt was a grief to her, and she showed that it was. It also grieved\r\nCrosbie to find that Lady Julia was to be a fellow guest with himself\r\nat Courcy Castle; but he did not show it. He expressed nothing but\r\nsmiles and civil self-congratulation on the matter, pretending\r\nthat he would have much delight in again meeting Lady Julia; but,\r\nin truth, he would have given much could he have invented any\r\nmanoeuvre by which her ladyship might have been kept at home.\r\n\r\n"What a horrid old woman she is," said Lily, as they rode back down\r\nthe avenue. "I beg your pardon, Bernard; for, of course, she is your\r\naunt."\r\n\r\n"Yes; she is my aunt; and though I am not very fond of her, I deny\r\nthat she is a horrid old woman. She never murdered anybody, or robbed\r\nanybody, or stole away any other woman\'s lover."\r\n\r\n"I should think not," said Lily.\r\n\r\n"She says her prayers earnestly, I have no doubt," continued Bernard,\r\n"and gives away money to the poor, and would sacrifice to-morrow any\r\ndesire of her own to her brother\'s wish. I acknowledge that she is\r\nugly, and pompous, and that, being a woman, she ought not to have\r\nsuch a long black beard on her upper lip."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care a bit about her beard," said Lily. "But why did she\r\ntell me to do my duty? I didn\'t go there to have a sermon preached to\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"And why did she talk about beauty being dangerous?" said Bell. "Of\r\ncourse, we all knew what she meant."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know at all what she meant," said Lily; "and I don\'t know\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"I think she\'s a charming woman, and I shall be especially civil to\r\nher at Lady De Courcy\'s," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\nAnd in this way, saying hard things of the poor old spinster whom\r\nthey had left, they made their way into Guestwick, and again\r\ndismounted at Mrs. Eames\'s door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO GUESTWICK.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: (untitled)]\r\n\r\nAs the party from Allington rode up the narrow High-street\r\nof Guestwick, and across the market square towards the small,\r\nrespectable, but very dull row of new houses in which Mrs. Eames\r\nlived, the people of Guestwick were all aware that Miss Lily Dale was\r\nescorted by her future husband. The opinion that she had been a very\r\nfortunate girl was certainly general among the Guestwickians, though\r\nit was not always expressed in open or generous terms. "It was a\r\ngreat match for her," some said, but shook their heads at the same\r\ntime, hinting that Mr. Crosbie\'s life in London was not all that it\r\nshould be, and suggesting that she might have been more safe had she\r\nbeen content to bestow herself upon some country neighbour of less\r\ndangerous pretensions. Others declared that it was no such great\r\nmatch after all. They knew his income to a penny, and believed\r\nthat the young people would find it very difficult to keep a house\r\nin London unless the old squire intended to assist them. But,\r\nnevertheless, Lily was envied as she rode through the town with her\r\nhandsome lover by her side.\r\n\r\nAnd she was very happy. I will not deny that she had some feeling of\r\ntriumphant satisfaction in the knowledge that she was envied. Such a\r\nfeeling on her part was natural, and is natural to all men and women\r\nwho are conscious that they have done well in the adjustment of their\r\nown affairs. As she herself had said, he was her bird, the spoil of\r\nher own gun, the product of such capacity as she had in her, on which\r\nshe was to live, and, if possible, to thrive during the remainder of\r\nher life. Lily fully recognized the importance of the thing she was\r\ndoing, and, in soberest guise, had thought much of this matter of\r\nmarriage. But the more she thought of it the more satisfied she was\r\nthat she was doing well. And yet she knew that there was a risk. He\r\nwho was now everything to her might die; nay, it was possible that\r\nhe might be other than she thought him to be; that he might neglect\r\nher, desert her, or misuse her. But she had resolved to trust in\r\neverything, and, having so trusted, she would not provide for herself\r\nany possibility of retreat. Her ship should go out into the middle\r\nocean, beyond all ken of the secure port from which it had sailed;\r\nher army should fight its battle with no hope of other safety than\r\nthat which victory gives. All the world might know that she loved him\r\nif all the world chose to inquire about the matter. She triumphed in\r\nher lover, and did not deny even to herself that she was triumphant.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eames was delighted to see them. It was so good in Mr. Crosbie\r\nto come over and call upon such a poor, forlorn woman as her, and so\r\ngood in Captain Dale; so good also in the dear girls, who, at the\r\npresent moment, had so much to make them happy at home at Allington!\r\nLittle things, accounted as bare civilities by others, were esteemed\r\nas great favours by Mrs. Eames.\r\n\r\n"And dear Mrs. Dale? I hope she was not fatigued when we kept her up\r\nthe other night so unconscionably late?" Bell and Lily both assured\r\nher that their mother was none the worse for what she had gone\r\nthrough; and then Mrs. Eames got up and left the room, with the\r\ndeclared purpose of looking for John and Mary, but bent, in truth, on\r\nthe production of some cake and sweet wine which she kept under lock\r\nand key in the little parlour.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let\'s stay here very long," whispered Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"No, not very long," said Lily. "But when you come to see my friends\r\nyou mustn\'t be in a hurry, Mr. Crosbie."\r\n\r\n"He had his turn with Lady Julia," said Bell, "and we must have ours\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, Mrs. Eames won\'t tell us to do our duty and to beware\r\nof being too beautiful," said Lily.\r\n\r\nMary and John came into the room before their mother returned; then\r\ncame Mrs. Eames, and a few minutes afterwards the cake and wine\r\narrived. It certainly was rather dull, as none of the party seemed to\r\nbe at their ease. The grandeur of Mr. Crosbie was too great for Mrs.\r\nEames and her daughter, and John was almost silenced by the misery of\r\nhis position. He had not yet answered Miss Roper\'s letter, nor had he\r\neven made up his mind whether he would answer it or no. And then the\r\nsight of Lily\'s happiness did not fill him with all that friendly joy\r\nwhich he should perhaps have felt as the friend of her childhood. To\r\ntell the truth, he hated Crosbie, and so he had told himself; and had\r\nso told his sister also very frequently since the day of the party.\r\n\r\n"I tell you what it is, Molly," he had said, "if there was any way of\r\ndoing it, I\'d fight that man."\r\n\r\n"What; and make Lily wretched?"\r\n\r\n"She\'ll never be happy with him. I\'m sure she won\'t. I don\'t want to\r\ndo her any harm, but yet I\'d like to fight that man,--if I only knew\r\nhow to manage it."\r\n\r\nAnd then he bethought himself that if they could both be slaughtered\r\nin such an encounter it would be the only fitting termination to the\r\npresent state of things. In that way, too, there would be an escape\r\nfrom Amelia, and, at the present moment, he saw none other.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the room he shook hands with all the party from\r\nAllington, but, as he told his sister afterwards, his flesh crept\r\nwhen he touched Crosbie. Crosbie, as he contemplated the Eames family\r\nsitting stiff and ill at ease in their own drawing-room chairs, made\r\nup his mind that it would be well that his wife should see as little\r\nof John Eames as might be when she came to London;--not that he was\r\nin any way jealous of her lover. He had learned everything from\r\nLily,--all, at least, that Lily knew,--and regarded the matter\r\nrather as a good joke. "Don\'t see him too often," he had said to\r\nher, "for fear he should make an ass of himself." Lily had told him\r\neverything,--all that she could tell; but yet he did not in the least\r\ncomprehend that Lily had, in truth, a warm affection for the young\r\nman whom he despised.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, no," said Crosbie. "I never do take wine in the middle of\r\nthe day."\r\n\r\n"But a bit of cake?" And Mrs. Eames by her look implored him to do\r\nher so much honour. She implored Captain Dale, also, but they were\r\nboth inexorable. I do not know that the two girls were at all more\r\ninclined to eat and drink than the two men; but they understood\r\nthat Mrs. Eames would be broken-hearted if no one partook of her\r\ndelicacies. The little sacrifices of society are all made by women,\r\nas are also the great sacrifices of life. A man who is good for\r\nanything is always ready for his duty, and so is a good woman always\r\nready for a sacrifice.\r\n\r\n"We really must go now," said Bell, "because of the horses." And\r\nunder this excuse they got away.\r\n\r\n"You will come over before you go back to London, John?" said Lily,\r\nas he came out with the intention of helping her mount, from which\r\npurpose, however, he was forced to recede by the iron will of Mr.\r\nCrosbie.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ll come over again--before I go. Good-by."\r\n\r\n"Good-by, John," said Bell. "Good-by, Eames," said Captain Dale.\r\nCrosbie, as he seated himself in the saddle, made the very slightest\r\nsign of recognition, to which his rival would not condescend to pay\r\nany attention. "I\'ll manage to have a fight with him in some way,"\r\nsaid Eames to himself as he walked back through the passage of his\r\nmother\'s house. And Crosbie, as he settled his feet in the stirrups,\r\nfelt that he disliked the young man more and more. It would be\r\nmonstrous to suppose that there could be aught of jealousy in the\r\nfeeling; and yet he did dislike him very strongly, and felt almost\r\nangry with Lily for asking him to come again to Allington. "I must\r\nput an end to all that," he said to himself as he rode silently out\r\nof town.\r\n\r\n"You must not snub my friends, sir," said Lily, smiling as she spoke,\r\nbut yet with something of earnestness in her voice. They were out of\r\nthe town by this time, and Crosbie had hardly uttered a word since\r\nthey had left Mrs. Eames\'s door. They were now on the high road, and\r\nBell and Bernard Dale were somewhat in advance of them.\r\n\r\n"I never snub anybody," said Crosbie, petulantly; "that is, unless\r\nthey have absolutely deserved snubbing."\r\n\r\n"And have I deserved it? Because I seem to have got it," said Lily.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Lily. I never snubbed you yet, and I don\'t think it likely\r\nthat I shall begin. But you ought not to accuse me of not being civil\r\nto your friends. In the first place I am as civil to them as my\r\nnature will allow me to be. And, in the second place--"\r\n\r\n"Well; in the second place--?"\r\n\r\n"I am not quite sure that you are very wise to encourage that young\r\nman\'s--friendship just at present."\r\n\r\n"That means, I suppose, that I am very wrong to do so?"\r\n\r\n"No, dearest, it does not mean that. If I meant so I would tell\r\nyou so honestly. I mean just what I say. There can, I suppose, be\r\nno doubt that he has filled himself with some kind of romantic\r\nattachment for you,--a foolish kind of love which I don\'t suppose he\r\never expected to gratify, but the idea of which lends a sort of grace\r\nto his life. When he meets some young woman fit to be his wife he\r\nwill forget all about it, but till then he will go about fancying\r\nhimself a despairing lover. And then such a young man as John Eames\r\nis very apt to talk of his fancies."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe for a moment that he would mention my name to any\r\none."\r\n\r\n"But, Lily, perhaps I may know more of young men than you do."\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course you do."\r\n\r\n"And I can assure you that they are generally too well inclined to\r\nmake free with the names of girls whom they think that they like. You\r\nmust not be surprised if I am unwilling that any man should make free\r\nwith your name."\r\n\r\nAfter this Lily was silent for a minute or two. She felt that an\r\ninjustice was being done to her and she was not inclined to put up\r\nwith it, but she could not quite see where the injustice lay. A great\r\ndeal was owing from her to Crosbie. In very much she was bound to\r\nyield to him, and she was anxious to do on his behalf even more than\r\nher duty. But yet she had a strong conviction that it would not be\r\nwell that she should give way to him in everything. She wished to\r\nthink as he thought as far as possible, but she could not say that\r\nshe agreed with him when she knew that she differed from him. John\r\nEames was an old friend whom she could not abandon, and so much at\r\nthe present time she felt herself obliged to say.\r\n\r\n"But, Adolphus--"\r\n\r\n"Well, dearest?"\r\n\r\n"You would not wish me to be unkind to so very old a friend as John\r\nEames? I have known him all my life, and we have all of us had a very\r\ngreat regard for the whole family. His father was my uncle\'s most\r\nparticular friend."\r\n\r\n"I think, Lily, you must understand what I mean. I don\'t want you to\r\nquarrel with any of them, or to be what you call unkind. But you need\r\nnot give special and pressing invitations to this young man to come\r\nand see you before he goes back to London, and then to come and see\r\nyou directly you get to London. You tell me that he has some kind of\r\nromantic idea of being in love with you;--of being in despair because\r\nyou are not in love with him. It\'s all great nonsense, no doubt, but\r\nit seems to me that under such circumstances you\'d better--just leave\r\nhim alone."\r\n\r\nAgain Lily was silent. These were her three last days, in which it\r\nwas her intention to be especially happy, but above all things to\r\nmake him especially happy. On no account would she say to him sharp\r\nwords, or encourage in her own heart a feeling of animosity against\r\nhim, and yet she believed him to be wrong; and so believing could\r\nhardly bring herself to bear the injury. Such was her nature, as\r\na Dale. And let it be remembered that very many who can devote\r\nthemselves for great sacrifices, cannot bring themselves to\r\nthe endurance of little injuries. Lily could have given up any\r\ngratification for her lover, but she could not allow herself to have\r\nbeen in the wrong, believing herself to have been in the right.\r\n\r\n"I have asked him now, and he must come," she said.\r\n\r\n"But do not press him to come any more."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not, after what you have said, Adolphus. If he comes over\r\nto Allington, he will see me in mamma\'s house, to which he has always\r\nbeen made welcome by her. Of course I understand perfectly--"\r\n\r\n"You understand what, Lily?"\r\n\r\nBut she had stopped herself, fearing that she might say that which\r\nwould be offensive to him if she continued.\r\n\r\n"What is it you understand, Lily?"\r\n\r\n"Do not press me to go on, Adolphus. As far as I can, I will do all\r\nthat you want me to do."\r\n\r\n"You meant to say that when you find yourself an inmate of my house,\r\nas a matter of course you could not ask your own friends to come and\r\nsee you. Was that gracious?"\r\n\r\n"Whatever I may have meant to say, I did not say that. Nor in truth\r\ndid I mean it. Pray don\'t go on about it now. These are to be our\r\nlast days, you know, and we shouldn\'t waste them by talking of things\r\nthat are unpleasant. After all poor Johnny Eames is nothing to me;\r\nnothing, nothing. How can any one be anything to me when I think of\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nBut even this did not bring Crosbie back at once into a pleasant\r\nhumour. Had Lily yielded to him and confessed that he was right, he\r\nwould have made himself at once as pleasant as the sun in May. But\r\nthis she had not done. She had simply abstained from her argument\r\nbecause she did not choose to be vexed, and had declared her\r\ncontinued purpose of seeing Eames on his promised visit. Crosbie\r\nwould have had her acknowledge herself wrong, and would have\r\ndelighted in the privilege of forgiving her. But Lily Dale was one\r\nwho did not greatly relish forgiveness, or any necessity of being\r\nforgiven. So they rode on, if not in silence, without much joy in\r\ntheir conversation. It was now late on the Monday afternoon, and\r\nCrosbie was to go early on the Wednesday morning. What if these three\r\nlast days should come to be marred with such terrible drawbacks as\r\nthese!\r\n\r\nBernard Dale had not spoken a word to his cousin of his suit, since\r\nthey had been interrupted by Crosbie and Lily as they were lying\r\non the bank by the ha-ha. He had danced with her again and again\r\nat Mrs. Dale\'s party, and had seemed to revert to his old modes of\r\nconversation without difficulty. Bell, therefore, had believed the\r\nmatter to be over, and was thankful to her cousin, declaring within\r\nher own bosom that the whole matter should be treated by her as\r\nthough it had never happened. To no one,--not even to her mother,\r\nwould she tell it. To such reticence she bound herself for his sake,\r\nfeeling that he would be best pleased that it should be so. But now\r\nas they rode on together, far in advance of the other couple, he\r\nagain returned to the subject.\r\n\r\n"Bell," said he, "am I to have any hope?"\r\n\r\n"Any hope as to what, Bernard?"\r\n\r\n"I hardly know whether a man is bound to take a single answer on such\r\na subject. But this I know, that if a man\'s heart is concerned, he is\r\nnot very willing to do so."\r\n\r\n"When that answer has been given honestly and truly--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no doubt. I don\'t at all suppose that you were dishonest or\r\nfalse when you refused to allow me to speak to you."\r\n\r\n"But, Bernard, I did not refuse to allow you to speak to me."\r\n\r\n"Something very like it. But, however, I have no doubt you were true\r\nenough. But, Bell, why should it be so? If you were in love with any\r\none else I could understand it."\r\n\r\n"I am not in love with any one else."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. And there are so many reasons why you and I should join our\r\nfortunes together."\r\n\r\n"It cannot be a question of fortune, Bernard."\r\n\r\n"Do listen to me. Do let me speak, at any rate. I presume I may at\r\nleast suppose that you do not dislike me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no."\r\n\r\n"And though you might not be willing to accept any man\'s hand merely\r\non a question of fortune, surely the fact that our marriage would be\r\nin every way suitable as regards money should not set you against it.\r\nOf my own love for you I will not speak further, as I do not doubt\r\nthat you believe what I say; but should you not question your own\r\nfeelings very closely before you determine to oppose the wishes of\r\nall those who are nearest to you?"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean mamma, Bernard?"\r\n\r\n"Not her especially, though I cannot but think she would like a\r\nmarriage that would keep all the family together, and would give you\r\nan equal claim to the property to that which I have."\r\n\r\n"That would not have a feather\'s-weight with mamma."\r\n\r\n"Have you asked her?"\r\n\r\n"No, I have mentioned the matter to no one."\r\n\r\n"Then you cannot know. And as to my uncle, I have the means of\r\nknowing that it is the great desire of his life. I must say that I\r\nthink some consideration for him should induce you to pause before\r\nyou give a final answer, even though no consideration for me should\r\nhave any weight with you."\r\n\r\n"I would do more for you than for him,--much more."\r\n\r\n"Then do this for me. Allow me to think that I have not yet had an\r\nanswer to my proposal; give me to this day month, to Christmas; till\r\nany time that you like to name, so that I may think that it is not\r\nyet settled, and may tell uncle Christopher that such is the case."\r\n\r\n"Bernard, it would be useless."\r\n\r\n"It would at any rate show him that you are willing to think of it."\r\n\r\n"But I am not willing to think of it;--not in that way. I do know my\r\nown mind thoroughly, and I should be very wrong if I were to deceive\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"And you wish me to give that as your only answer to my uncle?"\r\n\r\n"To tell the truth, Bernard, I do not much care what you may say to\r\nmy uncle in this matter. He can have no right to interfere in the\r\ndisposal of my hand, and therefore I need not regard his wishes on\r\nthe subject. I will explain to you in one word what my feelings are\r\nabout it. I would accept no man in opposition to mamma\'s wishes; but\r\nnot even for her could I accept any man in opposition to my own. But\r\nas concerns my uncle, I do not feel myself called on to consult him\r\nin any way on such a matter."\r\n\r\n"And yet he is the head of our family."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care anything about the family,--not in that way."\r\n\r\n"And he has been very generous to you all."\r\n\r\n"That I deny. He has not been generous to mamma. He is very hard\r\nand ungenerous to mamma. He lets her have that house because he is\r\nanxious that the Dales should seem to be respectable before the\r\nworld; and she lives in it, because she thinks it better for us that\r\nshe should do so. If I had my way, she should leave it to-morrow--or,\r\nat any rate, as soon as Lily is married. I would much sooner go into\r\nGuestwick, and live as the Eames do."\r\n\r\n"I think you are ungrateful, Bell."\r\n\r\n"No; I am not ungrateful. And as to consulting, Bernard,--I should\r\nbe much more inclined to consult you than him about my marriage. If\r\nyou would let me look on you altogether as a brother, I should think\r\nlittle of promising to marry no one whom you did not approve."\r\n\r\nBut such an agreement between them would by no means have suited\r\nBernard\'s views. He had thought, some four or five weeks back, that\r\nhe was not personally very anxious for this match. He had declared to\r\nhimself that he liked his cousin well enough; that it would be a good\r\nthing for him to settle himself; that his uncle was reasonable in his\r\nwishes and sufficiently liberal in his offers; and that, therefore,\r\nhe would marry. It had hardly occurred to him as probable that his\r\ncousin would reject so eligible an offer, and had certainly never\r\noccurred to him that he would have to suffer anything from such\r\nrejection. He had entertained none of that feeling of which lovers\r\nspeak when they declare that they are staking their all upon the\r\nhazard of a die. It had not seemed to him that he was staking\r\nanything, as he gently told his tale of languid love, lying on\r\nthe turf by the ha-ha. He had not regarded the possibility of\r\ndisappointment, of sorrow, and of a deeply-vexed mind. He would have\r\nfelt but little triumph if accepted, and had not thought that he\r\ncould be humiliated by any rejection. In this frame of mind he had\r\ngone to his work; but now he found, to his own surprise, that this\r\ngirl\'s answer had made him absolutely unhappy. Having expressed a\r\nwish for this thing, the very expression of the wish made him long to\r\npossess it. He found, as he rode along silently by her side, that he\r\nwas capable of more earnestness of desire than he had known himself\r\nto possess. He was at this moment unhappy, disappointed, anxious,\r\ndistrustful of the future, and more intent on one special toy than he\r\nhad ever been before, even as a boy. He was vexed, and felt himself\r\nto be sore at heart. He looked round at her, as she sat silent,\r\nquiet, and somewhat sad upon her pony, and declared to himself that\r\nshe was very beautiful,--that she was a thing to be gained if still\r\nthere might be the possibility of gaining her. He felt that he really\r\nloved her, and yet he was almost angry with himself for so feeling.\r\nWhy had he subjected himself to this numbing weakness? His love\r\nhad never given him any pleasure. Indeed he had never hitherto\r\nacknowledged it; but now he was driven to do so on finding it to be\r\nthe source of trouble and pain. I think it is open to us to doubt\r\nwhether, even yet, Bernard Dale was in love with his cousin; whether\r\nhe was not rather in love with his own desire. But against himself he\r\nfound a verdict that he was in love, and was angry with himself and\r\nwith all the world.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Bell," he said, coming close up to her, "I wish you could\r\nunderstand how I love you." And, as he spoke, his cousin\r\nunconsciously recognized more of affection in his tone, and less of\r\nthat spirit of bargaining which had seemed to pervade all his former\r\npleas, than she had ever found before.\r\n\r\n"And do I not love you? Have I not offered to be to you in all\r\nrespects as a sister?"\r\n\r\n"That is nothing. Such an offer to me now is simply laughing at me.\r\nBell, I tell you what,--I will not give you up. The fact is, you do\r\nnot know me yet,--not know me as you must know any man before you\r\nchoose him for your husband. You and Lily are not alike in this.\r\nYou are cautious, doubtful of yourself, and perhaps, also, somewhat\r\ndoubtful of others. My heart is set upon this, and I shall still try\r\nto succeed."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Bernard, do not say that! Believe me, when I tell you that it\r\ncan never be."\r\n\r\n"No; I will not believe you. I will not allow myself to be made\r\nutterly wretched. I tell you fairly that I will not believe you. I\r\nmay surely hope if I choose to hope. No, Bell, I will never give you\r\nup,--unless, indeed, I should see you become another man\'s wife."\r\n\r\nAs he said this, they all turned in through the squire\'s gate, and\r\nrode up to the yard in which it was their habit to dismount from\r\ntheir horses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nJOHN EAMES TAKES A WALK.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Eames watched the party of cavaliers as they rode away from\r\nhis mother\'s door, and then started upon a solitary walk, as soon\r\nas the noise of the horses\' hoofs had passed away out of the street.\r\nHe was by no means happy in his mind as he did so. Indeed, he was\r\noverwhelmed with care and trouble, and as he went along very gloomy\r\nthoughts passed through his mind. Had he not better go to Australia,\r\nor Vancouver\'s Island, or--? I will not name the places which the\r\npoor fellow suggested to himself as possible terminations of the long\r\njourneys which he might not improbably be called upon to take. That\r\nvery day, just before the Dales had come in, he had received a second\r\nletter from his darling Amelia, written very closely upon the heels\r\nof the first. Why had he not answered her? Was he ill? Was he untrue?\r\nNo; she would not believe that, and therefore fell back upon the\r\nprobability of his illness. If it was so, she would rush down to\r\nsee him. Nothing on earth should keep her from the bedside of her\r\nbetrothed. If she did not get an answer from her beloved John by\r\nreturn of post, she would be down with him at Guestwick by the\r\nexpress train. Here was a position for such a young man as John\r\nEames! And of Amelia Roper we may say that she was a young woman who\r\nwould not give up her game, as long as the least chance remained of\r\nher winning it. "I must go somewhere," John said to himself, as he\r\nput on his slouched hat and wandered forth through the back streets\r\nof Guestwick. What would his mother say when she heard of Amelia\r\nRoper? What would she say when she saw her?\r\n\r\nHe walked away towards the Manor, so that he might roam about the\r\nGuestwick woods in solitude. There was a path with a stile, leading\r\noff from the high road, about half a mile beyond the lodges through\r\nwhich the Dales had ridden up to the house, and by this path John\r\nEames turned in, and went away till he had left the Manor house\r\nbehind him, and was in the centre of the Guestwick woods. He knew\r\nthe whole ground well, having roamed there ever since he was first\r\nallowed to go forth upon his walks alone. He had thought of Lily Dale\r\nby the hour together, as he had lost himself among the oak-trees; but\r\nin those former days he had thought of her with some pleasure. Now he\r\ncould only think of her as of one gone from him for ever; and then\r\nhe had also to think of her whom he had taken to himself in Lily\'s\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nYoung men, very young men,--men so young that it may be almost a\r\nquestion whether or no they have as yet reached their manhood,--are\r\nmore inclined to be earnest and thoughtful when alone than they ever\r\nare when with others, even though those others be their elders. I\r\nfancy that, as we grow old ourselves, we are apt to forget that it\r\nwas so with us; and, forgetting it, we do not believe that it is\r\nso with our children. We constantly talk of the thoughtlessness of\r\nyouth. I do not know whether we might not more appropriately speak of\r\nits thoughtfulness. It is, however, no doubt, true that thought will\r\nnot at once produce wisdom. It may almost be a question whether such\r\nwisdom as many of us have in our mature years has not come from the\r\ndying out of the power of temptation, rather than as the results of\r\nthought and resolution. Men, full fledged and at their work, are, for\r\nthe most part, too busy for much thought; but lads, on whom the work\r\nof the world has not yet fallen with all its pressure,--they have\r\ntime for thinking.\r\n\r\nAnd thus John Eames was thoughtful. They who knew him best accounted\r\nhim to be a gay, good-hearted, somewhat reckless young man, open to\r\ntemptation, but also open to good impressions; as to whom no great\r\nsuccess could be predicated, but of whom his friends might fairly\r\nhope that he might so live as to bring upon them no disgrace and\r\nnot much trouble. But, above all things, they would have called him\r\nthoughtless. In so calling him, they judged him wrong. He was ever\r\nthinking,--thinking much of the world as it appeared to him, and of\r\nhimself as he appeared to the world; and thinking, also, of things\r\nbeyond the world. What was to be his fate here and hereafter? Lily\r\nDale was gone from him, and Amelia Roper was hanging round his neck\r\nlike a millstone! What, under such circumstances, was to be his fate\r\nhere and hereafter?\r\n\r\nWe may say that the difficulties in his way were not as yet very\r\ngreat. As to Lily, indeed, he had no room for hope; but, then,\r\nhis love for Lily had, perhaps, been a sentiment rather than a\r\npassion. Most young men have to go through that disappointment,\r\nand are enabled to bear it without much injury to their prospects\r\nor happiness. And in after-life the remembrance of such love is a\r\nblessing rather than a curse, enabling the possessor of it to feel\r\nthat in those early days there was something within him of which he\r\nhad no cause to be ashamed. I do not pity John Eames much in regard\r\nto Lily Dale. And then, as to Amelia Roper,--had he achieved but a\r\ntithe of that lady\'s experience in the world, or possessed a quarter\r\nof her audacity, surely such a difficulty as that need not have stood\r\nmuch in his way! What could Amelia do to him if he fairly told her\r\nthat he was not minded to marry her? In very truth he had never\r\npromised to do so. He was in no way bound to her, not even by honour.\r\nHonour, indeed, with such as her! But men are cowards before women\r\nuntil they become tyrants; and are easy dupes, till of a sudden they\r\nrecognize the fact that it is pleasanter to be the victimizer than\r\nthe victim,--and as easy. There are men, indeed, who never learn the\r\nlatter lesson.\r\n\r\nBut, though the cause for fear was so slight, poor John Eames was\r\nthoroughly afraid. Little things which, in connection with so deep\r\na sorrow as his, it is almost ridiculous to mention, added to his\r\nembarrassments, and made an escape from them seem to him to be\r\nimpossible. He could not return to London without going to Burton\r\nCrescent, because his clothes were there, and because he owed to Mrs.\r\nRoper some small sum of money which on his return to London he would\r\nnot have immediately in his pocket. He must therefore meet Amelia,\r\nand he knew that he had not the courage to tell a girl, face to face,\r\nthat he did not love her, after he had been once induced to say that\r\nhe did do so. His boldest conception did not go beyond the writing\r\nof a letter in which he would renounce her, and removing himself\r\naltogether from that quarter of the town in which Burton Crescent was\r\nsituated. But then about his clothes, and that debt of his? And what\r\nif Amelia should in the meantime come down to Guestwick and claim\r\nhim? Could he in his mother\'s presence declare that she had no right\r\nto make such claim? The difficulties, in truth, were not very great,\r\nbut they were too heavy for that poor young clerk from the Income-tax\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\nYou will declare that he must have been a fool and a coward. Yet\r\nhe could read and understand Shakspeare. He knew much,--by far too\r\nmuch,--of Byron\'s poetry by heart. He was a deep critic, often\r\nwriting down his criticisms in a lengthy journal which he kept. He\r\ncould write quickly, and with understanding; and I may declare that\r\nmen at his office had already ascertained that he was no fool. He\r\nknew his business, and could do it,--as many men failed to do who\r\nwere much less foolish before the world. And as to that matter of\r\ncowardice, he would have thought it the greatest blessing in the\r\nworld to be shut up in a room with Crosbie, having permission to\r\nfight with him till one of them should have been brought by stress\r\nof battle to give up his claim to Lily Dale. Eames was no coward. He\r\nfeared no man on earth. But he was terribly afraid of Amelia Roper.\r\n\r\nHe wandered about through the old Manor woods very ill at ease. The\r\npost from Guestwick went out at seven, and he must at once make up\r\nhis mind whether or no he would write to Amelia on that day. He must\r\nalso make up his mind as to what he would say to her. He felt that he\r\nshould at least answer her letter, let his answer be what it might.\r\nShould he promise to marry her,--say, in ten or twelve years\' time?\r\nShould he tell her that he was a blighted being, unfit for love, and\r\nwith humility entreat of her that he might be excused? Or should he\r\nwrite to her mother, telling her that Burton Crescent would not suit\r\nhim any longer, promising her to send the balance on receipt of his\r\nnext payment, and asking her to send his clothes in a bundle to the\r\nIncome-tax Office? Or should he go home to his own mother, and boldly\r\ntell it all to her?\r\n\r\nHe at last resolved that he must write the letter, and as he composed\r\nit in his mind he sat himself down beneath an old tree which stood on\r\na spot at which many of the forest tracks met and crossed each other.\r\nThe letter, as he framed it here, was not a bad letter, if only he\r\ncould have got it written and posted. Every word of it he chose with\r\nprecision, and in his mind he emphasized every expression which told\r\nhis mind clearly and justified his purpose. "He acknowledged himself\r\nto have been wrong in misleading his correspondent, and allowing her\r\nto imagine that she possessed his heart. He had not a heart at her\r\ndisposal. He had been weak not to write to her before, having been\r\ndeterred from doing so by the fear of giving her pain; but now he\r\nfelt that he was bound in honour to tell her the truth. Having\r\nso told her, he would not return to Burton Crescent, if it would\r\npain her to see him there. He would always have a deep regard for\r\nher,"--Oh, Johnny!--"and would hope anxiously that her welfare in\r\nlife might be complete." That was the letter, as he wrote it on the\r\ntablets of his mind under the tree; but the getting it put on to\r\npaper was a task, as he knew, of greater difficulty. Then, as he\r\nrepeated it to himself, he fell asleep.\r\n\r\n"Young man," said a voice in his ears as he slept. At first the voice\r\nspoke as a voice from his dream without waking him, but when it was\r\nrepeated, he sat up and saw that a stout gentleman was standing over\r\nhim. For a moment he did not know where he was, or how he had come\r\nthere; nor could he recollect, as he saw the trees about him, how\r\nlong he had been in the wood. But he knew the stout gentleman well\r\nenough, though he had not seen him for more than two years. "Young\r\nman," said the voice, "if you want to catch rheumatism, that\'s the\r\nway to do it. Why, it\'s young Eames, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: "Why, it\'s young Eames."]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Yes, my lord," said Johnny, raising himself up so that he was now\r\nsitting, instead of lying, as he looked up into the earl\'s rosy face.\r\n\r\n"I knew your father, and a very good man he was; only he shouldn\'t\r\nhave taken to farming. People think they can farm without learning\r\nthe trade, but that\'s a very great mistake. I can farm, because I\'ve\r\nlearned it. Don\'t you think you\'d better get up?" Whereupon Johnny\r\nraised himself to his feet. "Not but what you\'re very welcome to lie\r\nthere if you like it. Only, in October, you know--"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I\'m trespassing, my lord," said Eames. "I came in off the\r\npath, and--"\r\n\r\n"You\'re welcome; you\'re very welcome. If you\'ll come up to the house,\r\nI\'ll give you some luncheon." This hospitable offer, however, Johnny\r\ndeclined, alleging that it was late, and that he was going home to\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n"Come along," said the earl. "You can\'t go any shorter way than by\r\nthe house. Dear, dear, how well I remember your father. He was a much\r\ncleverer man than I am,--very much; but he didn\'t know how to send a\r\nbeast to market any better than a child. By-the-by, they have put you\r\ninto a public office, haven\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my lord."\r\n\r\n"And a very good thing, too,--a very good thing, indeed. But why were\r\nyou asleep in the wood? It isn\'t warm, you know. I call it rather\r\ncold." And the earl stopped, and looked at him, scrutinizing him, as\r\nthough resolved to inquire into so deep a mystery.\r\n\r\n"I was taking a walk, and thinking of something, I sat down."\r\n\r\n"Leave of absence, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my lord."\r\n\r\n"Have you got into trouble? You look as though you were in trouble.\r\nYour poor father used to be in trouble."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t taken to farming," said Johnny, with an attempt at a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha, ha,--quite right. No, don\'t take to farming. Unless you\r\nlearn it, you know, you might just as well take to shoemaking;--just\r\nthe same. You haven\'t got into trouble, then; eh?"\r\n\r\n"No, my lord, not particularly."\r\n\r\n"Not particularly! I know very well that young men do get into\r\ntrouble when they get up to London. If you want any--any advice, or\r\nthat sort of thing, you may come to me; for I knew your father well.\r\nDo you like shooting?"\r\n\r\n"I never did shoot anything."\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps better not. To tell the truth, I\'m not very fond of\r\nyoung men who take to shooting without having anything to shoot at.\r\nBy-the-by, now I think of it, I\'ll send your mother some game." It\r\nmay, however, here be fair to mention that game very often came\r\nfrom Guestwick Manor to Mrs. Eames. "And look here, cold pheasant\r\nfor breakfast is the best thing I know of. Pheasants at dinner are\r\nrubbish,--mere rubbish. Here we are at the house. Will you come in\r\nand have a glass of wine?"\r\n\r\nBut this John Eames declined, pleasing the earl better by doing\r\nso than he would have done by accepting it. Not that the lord was\r\ninhospitable or insincere in his offer, but he preferred that such a\r\none as John Eames should receive his proffered familiarity without\r\ntoo much immediate assurance. He felt that Eames was a little in awe\r\nof his companion\'s rank, and he liked him the better for it. He liked\r\nhim the better for it, and was a man apt to remember his likings. "If\r\nyou won\'t come in, good-by," and he gave Johnny his hand.\r\n\r\n"Good evening, my lord," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"And remember this; it is the deuce of a thing to have rheumatism in\r\nyour loins. I wouldn\'t go to sleep under a tree, if I were you,--not\r\nin October. But you\'re always welcome to go anywhere about the\r\nplace."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, my lord."\r\n\r\n"And if you should take to shooting,--but I dare say you won\'t; and\r\nif you come to trouble, and want advice, or that sort of thing, write\r\nto me. I knew your father well." And so they parted, Eames returning\r\non his road towards Guestwick.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, which he could not define, he felt better after\r\nhis interview with the earl. There had been something about the fat,\r\ngood-natured, sensible old man, which had cheered him, in spite of\r\nhis sorrow. "Pheasants for dinner are rubbish,--mere rubbish," he\r\nsaid to himself, over and over again, as he went along the road;\r\nand they were the first words which he spoke to his mother, after\r\nentering the house.\r\n\r\n"I wish we had some of that sort of rubbish," said she.\r\n\r\n"So you will, to-morrow;" and then he described to her his interview.\r\n\r\n"The earl was, at any rate, quite right about lying upon the ground.\r\nI wonder you can be so foolish. And he is right about your poor\r\nfather too. But you have got to change your boots; and we shall be\r\nready for dinner almost immediately."\r\n\r\nBut Johnny Eames, before he sat down to dinner, did write his letter\r\nto Amelia, and did go out to post it with his own hands,--much to his\r\nmother\'s annoyance. But the letter would not get itself written in\r\nthat strong and appropriate language which had come to him as he was\r\nroaming through the woods. It was a bald letter, and somewhat\r\ncowardly withal.\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR AMELIA [the letter ran],--I have received both of\r\n   yours; and did not answer the first because I felt that\r\n   there was a difficulty in expressing what I wish to say;\r\n   and now it will be better that you should allow the\r\n   subject to stand over till I am back in town. I shall be\r\n   there in ten days from this. I have been quite well, and\r\n   am so; but of course am much obliged by your inquiries.\r\n   I know you will think this very cold; but when I tell you\r\n   everything, you will agree with me that it is best. If I\r\n   were to marry, I know that we should be unhappy, because\r\n   we should have nothing to live on. If I have ever said\r\n   anything to deceive you, I beg your pardon with all my\r\n   heart;--but perhaps it will be better to let the subject\r\n   remain till we shall meet again in London.\r\n\r\n   Believe me to be\r\n   Your most sincere friend,\r\n   And I may say admirer,--[Oh, John Eames!]\r\n\r\n   JOHN EAMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLast days are wretched days; and so are last moments wretched\r\nmoments. It is not the fact that the parting is coming which makes\r\nthese days and moments so wretched, but the feeling that something\r\nspecial is expected from them, which something they always fail to\r\nproduce. Spasmodic periods of pleasure, of affection, or even of\r\nstudy, seldom fail of disappointment when premeditated. When last\r\ndays are coming, they should be allowed to come and to glide away\r\nwithout special notice or mention. And as for last moments, there\r\nshould be none such. Let them ever be ended, even before their\r\npresence has been acknowledged.\r\n\r\nBut Lily Dale had not yet been taught these lessons by her world\'s\r\nexperience, and she expected that this sweetest cup of which she had\r\never drank should go on being sweet--sweeter and still sweeter--as\r\nlong as she could press it to her lips. How the dregs had come to\r\nmix themselves with the last drops we have already seen; and on that\r\nsame day--on the Monday evening--the bitter task still remained; for\r\nCrosbie, as they walked about through the gardens in the evening,\r\nfound other subjects on which he thought it necessary to give her\r\nsundry hints, intended for her edification, which came to her with\r\nmuch of the savour of a lecture. A girl, when she is thoroughly in\r\nlove, as surely was the case with Lily, likes to receive hints as\r\nto her future life from the man to whom she is devoted; but she\r\nwould, I think, prefer that such hints should be short, and that the\r\nlesson should be implied rather than declared;--that they should, in\r\nfact, be hints and not lectures. Crosbie, who was a man of tact, who\r\nunderstood the world and had been dealing with women for many years,\r\nno doubt understood all this as well as we do. But he had come to\r\nentertain a notion that he was an injured man, that he was giving\r\nvery much more than was to be given to him, and that therefore he\r\nwas entitled to take liberties which might not fairly be within\r\nthe reach of another lover. My reader will say that in all this he\r\nwas ungenerous. Well; he was ungenerous. I do not know that I have\r\never said that much generosity was to be expected from him. He had\r\nsome principles of right and wrong under the guidance of which it\r\nmay perhaps be hoped that he will not go utterly astray; but his\r\npast life had not been of a nature to make him unselfish. He was\r\nungenerous, and Lily felt it, though she would not acknowledge it\r\neven to herself. She had been very open with him,--acknowledging the\r\ndepth of her love for him; telling him that he was now all in all to\r\nher; that life without his love would be impossible to her: and in a\r\ncertain way he took advantage of these strong avowals, treating her\r\nas though she were a creature utterly in his power;--as indeed she\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nOn that evening he said no more of Johnny Eames, but said much of\r\nthe difficulty of a man establishing himself with a wife in London,\r\nwho had nothing but his own moderate income on which to rely. He did\r\nnot in so many words tell her that if her friends could make up for\r\nher two or three thousand pounds,--that being much less than he had\r\nexpected when he first made his offer,--this terrible difficulty\r\nwould be removed; but he said enough to make her understand that the\r\nworld would call him very imprudent in taking a girl who had nothing.\r\nAnd as he spoke of these things, Lily remaining for the most part\r\nsilent as he did so, it occurred to him that he might talk to her\r\nfreely of his past life,--more freely than he would have done had he\r\nfeared that he might lose her by any such disclosures. He had no fear\r\nof losing her. Alas! might it not be possible that he had some such\r\nhope!\r\n\r\nHe told her that his past life had been expensive; that, though he\r\nwas not in debt, he had lived up to every shilling that he had, and\r\nthat he had contracted habits of expenditure which it would be almost\r\nimpossible for him to lay aside at a day\'s notice. Then he spoke of\r\nentanglements, meaning, as he did so, to explain more fully what were\r\ntheir nature,--but not daring to do so when he found that Lily was\r\naltogether in the dark as to what he meant. No; he was not a generous\r\nman,--a very ungenerous man. And yet, during all this time, he\r\nthought that he was guided by principle. "It will be best that I\r\nshould be honest with her," he said to himself. And then he told\r\nhimself, scores of times, that when making his offer he had expected,\r\nand had a right to expect, that she would not be penniless. Under\r\nthose circumstances he had done the best he could for her--offering\r\nher his heart honestly, with a quick readiness to make her his own\r\nat the earliest day that she might think possible. Had he been more\r\ncautious, he need not have fallen into this cruel mistake; but she,\r\nat any rate, could not quarrel with him for his imprudence. And\r\nstill he was determined to stand by his engagement and willing to\r\nmarry her, although, as he the more thought of it, he felt the more\r\nstrongly that he would thereby ruin his prospects, and thrust beyond\r\nhis own reach all those good things which he had hoped to win. As\r\nhe continued to talk to her he gave himself special credit for his\r\ngenerosity, and felt that he was only doing his duty by her in\r\npointing out to her all the difficulties which lay in the way of\r\ntheir marriage.\r\n\r\nAt first Lily said some words intended to convey an assurance that\r\nshe would be the most economical wife that man ever had, but she soon\r\nceased from such promises as these. Her perceptions were keen, and\r\nshe discovered that the difficulties of which he was afraid were\r\nthose which he must overcome before his marriage, not any which might\r\nbe expected to overwhelm him after it. "A cheap and nasty menage\r\nwould be my aversion," he said to her. "It is that which I want to\r\navoid,--chiefly for your sake." Then she promised him that she would\r\nwait patiently for his time--"even though it should be for seven\r\nyears," she said, looking up into his face and trying to find there\r\nsome sign of approbation. "That\'s nonsense," he said. "People are\r\nnot patriarchs now-a-days. I suppose we shall have to wait two years.\r\nAnd that\'s a deuce of a bore,--a terrible bore." And there was that\r\nin the tone of his voice which grated on her feelings, and made her\r\nwretched for the moment.\r\n\r\nAs he parted with her for the night on her own side of the little\r\nbridge which led from one garden to the other, he put his arm round\r\nher to embrace her and kiss her, as he had often done at that spot.\r\nIt had become a habit with them to say their evening farewells there,\r\nand the secluded little nook amongst the shrubs was inexpressibly\r\ndear to Lily. But on the present occasion she made an effort to avoid\r\nhis caress. She turned from him--very slightly, but it was enough,\r\nand he felt it. "Are you angry with me?" he said. "Oh, no! Adolphus;\r\nhow can I be angry with you?" And then she turned to him and gave\r\nhim her face to kiss almost before he had again asked for it. "He\r\nshall not at any rate think that I am unkind to him,--and it will not\r\nmatter now," she said to herself, as she walked slowly across the\r\nlawn, in the dark, up to her mother\'s drawing-room window.\r\n\r\n"Well, dearest," said Mrs. Dale, who was there alone; "did the beards\r\nwag merry in the Great Hall this evening?" That was a joke with them,\r\nfor neither Crosbie nor Bernard Dale used a razor at his toilet.\r\n\r\n"Not specially merry. And I think it was my fault, for I have a\r\nheadache. Mamma, I believe I will go at once to bed."\r\n\r\n"My darling, is there anything wrong?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, mamma. But we had such a long ride; and then Adolphus is\r\ngoing, and of course we have so much to say. To-morrow will be the\r\nlast day, for I shall only just see him on Wednesday morning; and as\r\nI want to be well, if possible, I\'ll go to bed." And so she took her\r\ncandle and went.\r\n\r\nWhen Bell came up, Lily was still awake, but she begged her sister\r\nnot to disturb her. "Don\'t talk to me, Bell," she said. "I\'m trying\r\nto make myself quiet, and I half feel that I should get childish if\r\nI went on talking. I have almost more to think of than I know how to\r\nmanage." And she strove, not altogether unsuccessfully, to speak with\r\na cheery tone, as though the cares which weighed upon her were not\r\nunpleasant in their nature. Then her sister kissed her and left her\r\nto her thoughts.\r\n\r\nAnd she had great matter for thinking; so great, that many hours\r\nsounded in her ears from the clock on the stairs before she brought\r\nher thoughts to a shape that satisfied herself. She did so bring them\r\nat last, and then she slept. She did so bring them, toiling over her\r\nwork with tears that made her pillow wet, with heart-burning and\r\nalmost with heart-breaking, with much doubting, and many anxious,\r\neager inquiries within her own bosom as to that which she ought to\r\ndo, and that which she could endure to do. But at last her resolve\r\nwas taken, and then she slept.\r\n\r\nIt had been agreed between them that Crosbie should come down to\r\nthe Small House on the next day after breakfast, and remain there\r\ntill the time came for riding. But Lily determined to alter this\r\narrangement, and accordingly put on her hat immediately after\r\nbreakfast, and posted herself at the bridge, so as to intercept her\r\nlover as he came. He soon appeared with his friend Dale, and she at\r\nonce told him her purpose.\r\n\r\n"I want to have a talk with you, Adolphus, before you go in to mamma;\r\nso come with me into the field."\r\n\r\n"All right," said he.\r\n\r\n"And Bernard can finish his cigar on the lawn. Mamma and Bell will\r\njoin him there."\r\n\r\n"All right," said Bernard. So they separated; and Crosbie went away\r\nwith Lily into the field where they had first learned to know each\r\nother in those haymaking days.\r\n\r\nShe did not say much till they were well away from the house; but\r\nanswered what words he chose to speak,--not knowing very well of what\r\nhe spoke. But when she considered that they had reached the proper\r\nspot, she began very abruptly.\r\n\r\n"Adolphus," she said, "I have something to say to you,--something to\r\nwhich you must listen very carefully." Then he looked at her, and at\r\nonce knew that she was in earnest.\r\n\r\n"This is the last day on which I could say it," she continued; "and\r\nI am very glad that I have not let the last day go by without saying\r\nit. I should not have known how to put it in a letter."\r\n\r\n"What is it, Lily?"\r\n\r\n"And I do not know that I can say it properly; but I hope that you\r\nwill not be hard upon me. Adolphus, if you wish that all this between\r\nus should be over, I will consent."\r\n\r\n"Lily!"\r\n\r\n"I mean what I say. If you wish it, I will consent; and when I have\r\nsaid so, proposing it myself, you may be quite sure that I shall\r\nnever blame you, if you take me at my word."\r\n\r\n"Are you tired of me, Lily?"\r\n\r\n"No. I shall never be tired of you,--never weary with loving you. I\r\ndid not wish to say so now; but I will answer your question boldly.\r\nTired of you! I fancy that a girl can never grow tired of her lover.\r\nBut I would sooner die in the struggle than be the cause of your\r\nruin. It would be better,--in every way better."\r\n\r\n"I have said nothing of being ruined."\r\n\r\n"But listen to me. I should not die if you left me,--not be utterly\r\nbroken-hearted. Nothing on earth can I ever love as I have loved you.\r\nBut I have a God and a Saviour that will be enough for me. I can\r\nturn to them with content, if it be well that you should leave me. I\r\nhave gone to them, and--" But at this moment she could utter no more\r\nwords. She had broken down in her effort, losing her voice through\r\nthe strength of her emotion. As she did not choose that he should see\r\nher overcome, she turned from him and walked away across the grass.\r\n\r\nOf course he followed her; but he was not so quick after her, but\r\nthat time had been given to her to recover herself. "It is true,"\r\nshe said. "I have the strength of which I tell you. Though I have\r\ngiven myself to you as your wife, I can bear to be divorced from\r\nyou now,--now. And, my love, though it may sound heartless, I would\r\nsooner be so divorced from you, than cling to you as a log that must\r\ndrag you down under the water, and drown you in trouble and care. I\r\nwould;--indeed I would. If you go, of course that kind of thing is\r\nover for me. But the world has more than that,--much more; and I\r\nwould make myself happy;--yes, my love, I would be happy. You need\r\nnot fear that."\r\n\r\n"But, Lily, why is all this said to me here to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Because it is my duty to say it. I understand all your position now,\r\nthough it is only now. It never flashed on me till yesterday. When\r\nyou proposed to me, you thought that I,--that I had some fortune."\r\n\r\n"Never mind that now, Lily."\r\n\r\n"But you did. I see it all now. I ought perhaps to have told you that\r\nit was not so. There has been the mistake, and we are both sufferers.\r\nBut we need not make the suffering deeper than needs be. My love, you\r\nare free,--from this moment. And even my heart shall not blame you\r\nfor accepting your freedom."\r\n\r\n"And are you afraid of poverty?" he asked her.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid of poverty for you. You and I have lived differently.\r\nLuxuries, of which I know nothing, have been your daily comforts. I\r\ntell you I can bear to part with you, but I cannot bear to become the\r\nsource of your unhappiness. Yes; I will bear it; and none shall dare\r\nin my hearing to speak against you. I have brought you here to say\r\nthe word; nay, more than that,--to advise you to say it."\r\n\r\nHe stood silent for a moment, during which he held her by the hand.\r\nShe was looking into his face, but he was looking away into the\r\nclouds; striving to appear as though he was the master of the\r\noccasion. But during those moments his mind was wracked with doubt.\r\nWhat if he should take her at her word? Some few would say bitter\r\nthings against him, but such bitter things had been said against many\r\nanother man without harming him. Would it not be well for both if he\r\nshould take her at her word? She would recover and love again, as\r\nother girls had done; and as for him, he would thus escape from the\r\nruin at which he had been gazing for the last week past. For it was\r\nruin,--utter ruin. He did love her; so he declared to himself. But\r\nwas he a man who ought to throw the world away for love? Such men\r\nthere were; but was he one of them? Could he be happy in that small\r\nhouse, somewhere near the New Road, with five children and horrid\r\nmisgivings as to the baker\'s bill? Of all men living, was not he the\r\nlast that should have allowed himself to fall into such a trap? All\r\nthis passed through his mind as he turned his face up to the clouds\r\nwith a look that was intended to be grand and noble.\r\n\r\n"Speak to me, Adolphus, and say that it shall be so."\r\n\r\nThen his heart misgave him, and he lacked the courage to extricate\r\nhimself from his trouble; or, as he afterwards said to himself, he\r\nhad not the heart to do it. "If I understand you, rightly, Lily, all\r\nthis comes from no want of love on your own part?"\r\n\r\n"Want of love on my part? But you should not ask me that."\r\n\r\n"Until you tell me that there is such a want, I will agree to\r\nno parting." Then he took her hand and put it within his arm.\r\n"No, Lily; whatever may be our cares and troubles, we are bound\r\ntogether,--indissolubly."\r\n\r\n"Are we?" said she; and as she spoke, her voice trembled, and her\r\nhand shook.\r\n\r\n"Much too firmly for any such divorce as that. No, Lily, I claim the\r\nright to tell you all my troubles; but I shall not let you go."\r\n\r\n"But, Adolphus--" and the hand on his arm was beginning to cling to\r\nit again.\r\n\r\n"Adolphus," said he, "has got nothing more to say on that subject. He\r\nexercises the right which he believes to be his own, and chooses to\r\nretain the prize which he has won."\r\n\r\nShe was now clinging to him in very truth. "Oh, my love!" she\r\nsaid. "I do not know how to say it again. It is of you that I am\r\nthinking;--of you, of you!"\r\n\r\n"I know you are; but you have misunderstood me a little; that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Have I? Then listen to me again, once more, my heart\'s own darling,\r\nmy love, my husband, my lord! If I cannot be to you at once like\r\nRuth, and never cease from coming after you, my thoughts to you shall\r\nbe like those of Ruth:--if aught but death part thee and me, may God\r\ndo so to me and more also." Then she fell upon his breast and wept.\r\n\r\nHe still hardly understood the depth of her character. He was not\r\nhimself deep enough to comprehend it all. But yet he was awed by her\r\ngreat love, and exalted to a certain solemnity of feeling which for\r\nthe time made him rejoice in his late decision. For a few hours he\r\nwas minded to throw the world behind him, and wear this woman, as\r\nsuch a woman should be worn,--as a comforter to him in all things,\r\nand a strong shield against great troubles. "Lily," he said, "my own\r\nLily!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, your own, to take when you please, and leave untaken while you\r\nplease; and as much your own in one way as in the other." Then she\r\nlooked up again, and essayed to laugh as she did so. "You will think\r\nI am frantic, but I am so happy. I don\'t care about your going now;\r\nindeed I don\'t. There; you may go now, this minute, if you like it."\r\nAnd she withdrew her hand from him. "I feel so differently from what\r\nI have done for the last few days. I am so glad you have spoken to me\r\nas you did. Of course I ought to bear all those things with you. But\r\nI cannot be unhappy about it now. I wonder if I went to work and made\r\na lot of things, whether that would help?"\r\n\r\n"A set of shirts for me, for instance?"\r\n\r\n"I could do that, at any rate."\r\n\r\n"It may come to that yet, some of these days."\r\n\r\n"I pray God that it may." Then again she was serious, and the tears\r\ncame once more into her eyes. "I pray God that it may. To be of use\r\nto you,--to work for you,--to do something for you that may have in\r\nit some sober, earnest purport of usefulness;--that is what I want\r\nabove all things. I want to be with you at once that I may be of\r\nservice to you. Would that you and I were alone together, that I\r\nmight do everything for you. I sometimes think that a very poor man\'s\r\nwife is the happiest, because she does do everything."\r\n\r\n"You shall do everything very soon," said he; and then they sauntered\r\nalong pleasantly through the morning hours, and when they again\r\nappeared at Mrs. Dale\'s table, Mrs. Dale and Bell were astonished at\r\nLily\'s brightness. All her old ways had seemed to return to her, and\r\nshe made her little saucy speeches to Mr. Crosbie as she had used to\r\ndo when he was first becoming fascinated by her sweetness. "You know\r\nthat you\'ll be such a swell when you get to that countess\'s house\r\nthat you\'ll forget all about Allington."\r\n\r\n"Of course I shall," said he.\r\n\r\n"And the paper you write upon will be all over coronets,--that is, if\r\never you do write. Perhaps you will to Bernard some day, just to show\r\nthat you are staying at a castle."\r\n\r\n"You certainly don\'t deserve that he should write to you," said Mrs.\r\nDale.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t expect it for a moment,--not till he gets back to London\r\nand finds that he has nothing else to do at his office. But I should\r\nso like to see how you and Lady Julia get on together. It was quite\r\nclear that she regarded you as an ogre; didn\'t she, Bell?"\r\n\r\n"So many people are ogres to Lady Julia," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"I believe Lady Julia to be a very good woman," said Mrs. Dale, "and\r\nI won\'t have her abused."\r\n\r\n"Particularly before poor Bernard, who is her pet nephew," said Lily.\r\n"I dare say Adolphus will become a pet too when she has been a week\r\nwith him at Courcy Castle. Do try and cut Bernard out."\r\n\r\nFrom all which Mrs. Dale learned that some care which had sat heavy\r\non Lily\'s heart was now lightened, if not altogether removed. She\r\nhad asked no questions of her daughter, but she had perceived during\r\nthe past few days that Lily was in trouble, and she knew that such\r\ntrouble had arisen from her engagement. She had asked no questions,\r\nbut of course she had been told what was Mr. Crosbie\'s income, and\r\nhad been made to understand that it was not to be considered as\r\namply sufficient for all the wants of matrimony. There was little\r\ndifficulty in guessing what was the source of Lily\'s care, and as\r\nlittle in now perceiving that something had been said between them by\r\nwhich that care had been relieved.\r\n\r\nAfter that they all rode, and the afternoon went by pleasantly. It\r\nwas the last day indeed, but Lily had determined that she would not\r\nbe sad. She had told him that he might go now, and that she would\r\nnot be discontented at his going. She knew that the morrow would be\r\nvery blank to her; but she struggled to live up to the spirit of her\r\npromise, and she succeeded. They all dined at the Great House, even\r\nMrs. Dale doing so upon this occasion. When they had come in from the\r\ngarden in the evening, Crosbie talked more to Mrs. Dale than he did\r\neven to Lily, while Lily sat a little distant, listening with all her\r\nears, sometimes saying a low-toned word, and happy beyond expression\r\nin the feeling that her mother and her lover should understand each\r\nother. And it must be understood that Crosbie at this time was fully\r\ndetermined to conquer the difficulties of which he had thought so\r\nmuch, and to fix the earliest day which might be possible for his\r\nmarriage. The solemnity of that meeting in the field still hung about\r\nhim, and gave to his present feelings a manliness and a truth of\r\npurpose which were too generally wanting to them. If only those\r\nfeelings would last! But now he talked to Mrs. Dale about her\r\ndaughter, and about their future prospects, in a tone which he could\r\nnot have used had not his mind for the time been true to her. He\r\nhad never spoken so freely to Lily\'s mother, and at no time had Mrs.\r\nDale felt for him so much of a mother\'s love. He apologized for the\r\nnecessity of some delay, arguing that he could not endure to see his\r\nyoung wife without the comfort of a home of her own, and that he\r\nwas now, as he always had been, afraid of incurring debt. Mrs. Dale\r\ndisliked waiting engagements,--as do all mothers,--but she could not\r\nanswer unkindly to such pleading as this.\r\n\r\n"Lily is so very young," she said, "that she may well wait for a year\r\nor so."\r\n\r\n"For seven years," said Lily, jumping up and whispering into her\r\nmother\'s ear. "I shall hardly be six-and-twenty then, which is not at\r\nall too old."\r\n\r\nAnd so the evening passed away very pleasantly.\r\n\r\n"God bless you, Adolphus!" Mrs. Dale said to him, as she parted with\r\nhim at her own door. It was the first time that she had called him by\r\nhis Christian name. "I hope you understand how much we are trusting\r\nto you."\r\n\r\n"I do,--I do," said he, as he pressed her hand. Then as he walked\r\nback alone, he swore to himself, binding himself to the oath with\r\nall his heart, that he would be true to those women,--both to the\r\ndaughter and to the mother; for the solemnity of the morning was\r\nstill upon him.\r\n\r\nHe was to start the next morning before eight, Bernard having\r\nundertaken to drive him over to the railway at Guestwick. The\r\nbreakfast was on the table shortly after seven; and just as the two\r\nmen had come down, Lily entered the room, with her hat and shawl. "I\r\nsaid I would be in to pour out your tea," said she; and then she sat\r\nherself down over against the teapot.\r\n\r\nIt was a silent meal, for people do not know what to say in those\r\nlast minutes. And Bernard, too, was there; proving how true is the\r\nadage which says, that two are company, but that three are not. I\r\nthink that Lily was wrong to come up on that last morning; but she\r\nwould not hear of letting him start without seeing him, when her\r\nlover had begged her not to put herself to so much trouble. Trouble!\r\nWould she not have sat up all night to see even the last of the top\r\nof his hat?\r\n\r\nThen Bernard, muttering something about the horse, went away. "I have\r\nonly one minute to speak to you," said she, jumping up, "and I have\r\nbeen thinking all night of what I had to say. It is so easy to think,\r\nand so hard to speak."\r\n\r\n"My darling, I understand it all."\r\n\r\n"But you must understand this, that I will never distrust you. I\r\nwill never ask you to give me up again, or say that I could be happy\r\nwithout you. I could not live without you; that is, without the\r\nknowledge that you are mine. But I will never be impatient, never.\r\nPray, pray believe me! Nothing shall make me distrust you."\r\n\r\n"Dearest Lily, I will endeavour to give you no cause."\r\n\r\n"I know you will not; but I specially wanted to tell you that. And\r\nyou will write,--very soon?"\r\n\r\n"Directly I get there."\r\n\r\n"And as often as you can. But I won\'t bother you; only your letters\r\nwill make me so happy. I shall be so proud when they come to me. I\r\nshall be afraid of writing too much to you, for fear I should tire\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"You will never do that."\r\n\r\n"Shall I not? But you must write first, you know. If you could only\r\nunderstand how I shall live upon your letters! And now good-by. There\r\nare the wheels. God bless you, my own, my own!" And she gave herself\r\nup into his arms, as she had given herself up into his heart.\r\n\r\nShe stood at the door as the two men got into the gig, and, as it\r\npassed down through the gate, she hurried out upon the terrace, from\r\nwhence she could see it for a few yards down the lane. Then she ran\r\nfrom the terrace to the gate, and, hurrying through the gate, made\r\nher way into the churchyard, from the farther corner of which she\r\ncould see the heads of the two men till they had made the turn into\r\nthe main road beyond the parsonage. There she remained till the very\r\nsound of the wheels no longer reached her ears, stretching her eyes\r\nin the direction they had taken. Then she turned round slowly and\r\nmade her way out at the churchyard gate, which opened on to the road\r\nclose to the front door of the Small House.\r\n\r\n"I should like to punch his head," said Hopkins, the gardener, to\r\nhimself, as he saw the gig driven away and saw Lily trip after it,\r\nthat she might see the last of him whom it carried. "And I wouldn\'t\r\nthink nothing of doing it; no more I wouldn\'t," Hopkins added in his\r\nsoliloquy. It was generally thought about the place that Miss Lily\r\nwas Hopkins\'s favourite; though he showed it chiefly by snubbing her\r\nmore frequently than he snubbed her sister.\r\n\r\nLily had evidently intended to return home through the front door;\r\nbut she changed her purpose before she reached the house, and made\r\nher way slowly back through the churchyard, and by the gate of the\r\nGreat House, and by the garden at the back of it, till she crossed\r\nthe little bridge. But on the bridge she rested awhile, leaning\r\nagainst the railing as she had often leant with him, and thinking of\r\nall that had passed since that July day on which she had first met\r\nhim. On no spot had he so often told her of his love as on this, and\r\nnowhere had she so eagerly sworn to him that she would be his own\r\ndutiful loving wife.\r\n\r\n"And by God\'s help so I will," she said to herself, as she walked\r\nfirmly up to the house. "He has gone, mamma," she said, as she\r\nentered the breakfast-room. "And now we\'ll go back to our work-a-day\r\nways; it has been all Sunday for me for the last six weeks."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nMR. CROSBIE MEETS AN OLD CLERGYMAN ON HIS WAY TO COURCY CASTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: (untitled)]\r\n\r\nFor the first mile or two of their journey Crosbie and Bernard Dale\r\nsat, for the most part, silent in their gig. Lily, as she ran down\r\nto the churchyard corner and stood there looking after them with\r\nher loving eyes, had not been seen by them. But the spirit of her\r\ndevotion was still strong upon them both, and they felt that it\r\nwould not be well to strike at once into any ordinary topic of\r\nconversation. And, moreover, we may presume that Crosbie did feel\r\nmuch at thus parting from such a girl as Lily Dale, with whom he\r\nhad lived in close intercourse for the last six weeks, and whom he\r\nloved with all his heart,--with all the heart that he had for such\r\npurposes. In those doubts as to his marriage which had troubled him\r\nhe had never expressed to himself any disapproval of Lily. He had not\r\ntaught himself to think that she was other than he would have her be,\r\nthat he might thus give himself an excuse for parting from her. Not\r\nas yet, at any rate, had he had recourse to that practice, so common\r\nwith men who wish to free themselves from the bonds with which they\r\nhave permitted themselves to be bound. Lily had been too sweet to\r\nhis eyes, to his touch, to all his senses for that. He had enjoyed\r\ntoo keenly the pleasure of being with her, and of hearing her tell\r\nhim that she loved him, to allow of his being personally tired of\r\nher. He had not been so spoilt by his club life but that he had\r\ntaken exquisite pleasure in all her nice country ways, and soft,\r\nkind-hearted, womanly humour. He was by no means tired of Lily.\r\nBetter than any of his London pleasures was this pleasure of making\r\nlove in the green fields to Lily Dale. It was the consequences of\r\nit that affrighted him. Babies with their belongings would come;\r\nand dull evenings, over a dull fire, or else the pining grief of\r\na disappointed woman. He would be driven to be careful as to his\r\nclothes, because the ordering of a new coat would entail a serious\r\nexpenditure. He could go no more among countesses and their\r\ndaughters, because it would be out of the question that his wife\r\nshould visit at their houses. All the victories that he had ever won\r\nmust be given up. He was thinking of this even while the gig was\r\ngoing round the corner near the parsonage house, and while Lily\'s\r\neyes were still blessed with some view of his departing back; but he\r\nwas thinking, also, that moment, that there might be other victory\r\nin store for him; that it might be possible for him to learn to\r\nlike that fireside, even though babies should be there, and a woman\r\nopposite to him intent on baby cares. He was struggling as best he\r\nknew how; for the solemnity which Lily had imparted to him had not\r\nyet vanished from his spirit.\r\n\r\n"I hope that, upon the whole, you feel contented with your visit?"\r\nsaid Bernard to him, at last.\r\n\r\n"Contented? Of course I do."\r\n\r\n"That is easily said; and civility to me, perhaps, demands as much.\r\nBut I know that you have, to some extent, been disappointed."\r\n\r\n"Well; yes. I have been disappointed as regards money. It is of no\r\nuse denying it."\r\n\r\n"I should not mention it now, only that I want to know that you\r\nexonerate me."\r\n\r\n"I have never blamed you;--neither you, nor anybody else; unless,\r\nindeed, it has been myself."\r\n\r\n"You mean that you regret what you\'ve done?"\r\n\r\n"No; I don\'t mean that. I am too devotedly attached to that dear girl\r\nwhom we have just left to feel any regret that I have engaged myself\r\nto her. But I do think that had I managed better with your uncle\r\nthings might have been different."\r\n\r\n"I doubt it. Indeed I know that it is not so; and can assure you\r\nthat you need not make yourself unhappy on that score. I had\r\nthought, as you well know, that he would have done something for\r\nLily;--something, though not as much as he always intended to do for\r\nBell. But you may be sure of this; that he had made up his mind as to\r\nwhat he would do. Nothing that you or I could have said would have\r\nchanged him."\r\n\r\n"Well; we won\'t say anything more about it," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\nThen they went on again in silence, and arrived at Guestwick in ample\r\ntime for the train.\r\n\r\n"Let me know as soon as you get to town," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course. I\'ll write to you before that."\r\n\r\nAnd so they parted. As Dale turned and went, Crosbie felt that he\r\nliked him less than he had done before; and Bernard, also, as he was\r\ndriving him, came to the conclusion that Crosbie would not be so\r\ngood a fellow as a brother-in-law as he had been as a chance friend.\r\n"He\'ll give us trouble, in some way; and I\'m sorry that I brought him\r\ndown." That was Dale\'s inward conviction in the matter.\r\n\r\nCrosbie\'s way from Guestwick lay, by railway, to Barchester, the\r\ncathedral city lying in the next county, from whence he purposed to\r\nhave himself conveyed over to Courcy. There had, in truth, been no\r\ncause for his very early departure, as he was aware that all arrivals\r\nat country houses should take place at some hour not much previous\r\nto dinner. He had been determined to be so soon upon the road by a\r\nfeeling that it would be well for him to get over those last hours.\r\nThus he found himself in Barchester at eleven o\'clock, with nothing\r\non his hands to do; and, having nothing else to do, he went to\r\nchurch. There was a full service at the cathedral, and as the verger\r\nmarshalled him up to one of the empty stalls, a little spare old man\r\nwas beginning to chant the Litany. "I did not mean to fall in for all\r\nthis," said Crosbie, to himself, as he settled himself with his arms\r\non the cushion. But the peculiar charm of that old man\'s voice soon\r\nattracted him;--a voice that, though tremulous, was yet strong; and\r\nhe ceased to regret the saint whose honour and glory had occasioned\r\nthe length of that day\'s special service.\r\n\r\n"And who is the old gentleman who chanted the Litany?" he asked\r\nthe verger afterwards, as he allowed himself to be shown round the\r\nmonuments of the cathedral.\r\n\r\n"That\'s our precentor, sir; Mr. Harding. You must have heard of Mr.\r\nHarding." But Crosbie, with a full apology, confessed his ignorance.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir; he\'s pretty well known too, tho\' he is so shy like. He\'s\r\nfather-in-law to our dean, sir; and father-in-law to Archdeacon\r\nGrantly also."\r\n\r\n"His daughters have all gone into the profession, then?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes; but Miss Eleanor--for I remember her before she was\r\nmarried at all,--when they lived at the hospital--"\r\n\r\n"At the hospital?"\r\n\r\n"Hiram\'s hospital, sir. He was warden, you know. You should go and\r\nsee the hospital, sir, if you never was there before. Well, Miss\r\nEleanor,--that was his youngest,--she married Mr. Bold as her first.\r\nBut now she\'s the dean\'s lady."\r\n\r\n"Oh; the dean\'s lady, is she?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed. And what do you think, sir? Mr. Harding might have been\r\ndean himself if he\'d liked. They did offer it to him."\r\n\r\n"And he refused it?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed he did, sir."\r\n\r\n"Nolo decanari. I never heard of that before. What made him so\r\nmodest?"\r\n\r\n"Just that, sir; because he is modest. He\'s past his seventy\r\nnow,--ever so much; but he\'s just as modest as a young girl. A deal\r\nmore modest than some of them. To see him and his granddaughter\r\ntogether!"\r\n\r\n"And who is his granddaughter?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Lady Dumbello, as will be the Marchioness of Hartletop."\r\n\r\n"I know Lady Dumbello," said Crosbie; not meaning, however, to boast\r\nto the verger of his noble acquaintance.\r\n\r\n"Oh, do you, sir?" said the man, unconsciously touching his hat at\r\nthis sign of greatness in the stranger; though in truth he had no\r\nlove for her ladyship. "Perhaps you\'re going to be one of the party\r\nat Courcy Castle."\r\n\r\n"Well, I believe I am."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find her ladyship there before you. She lunched with her aunt\r\nat the deanery as she went through, yesterday; finding it too much\r\ntrouble to go out to her father\'s, at Plumstead. Her father is the\r\narchdeacon, you know. They do say,--but her ladyship is your friend!"\r\n\r\n"No friend at all; only a very slight acquaintance. She\'s quite as\r\nmuch above my line as she is above her father\'s."\r\n\r\n"Well, she is above them all. They say she would hardly as much as\r\nspeak to the old gentleman."\r\n\r\n"What, her father?"\r\n\r\n"No, Mr. Harding; he that chanted the Litany just now. There he is,\r\nsir, coming out of the deanery."\r\n\r\nThey were now standing at the door leading out from one of the\r\ntransepts, and Mr. Harding passed them as they were speaking\r\ntogether. He was a little, withered, shambling old man, with bent\r\nshoulders, dressed in knee-breeches and long black gaiters, which\r\nhung rather loosely about his poor old legs,--rubbing his hands one\r\nover the other as he went. And yet he walked quickly; not tottering\r\nas he walked, but with an uncertain, doubtful step. The verger, as\r\nMr. Harding passed, put his hand to his head, and Crosbie also raised\r\nhis hat. Whereupon Mr. Harding raised his, and bowed, and turned\r\nround as though he were about to speak. Crosbie felt that he had\r\nnever seen a face on which traits of human kindness were more plainly\r\nwritten. But the old man did not speak. He turned his body half\r\nround, and then shambled back, as though ashamed of his intention,\r\nand passed on.\r\n\r\n"He is of that sort that they make the angels of," said the verger.\r\n"But they can\'t make many if they want them all as good as he is.\r\nI\'m much obliged to you, sir." And he pocketed the half-crown which\r\nCrosbie gave him.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: "He is of that sort that they make the angels of,"\r\nsaid the verger.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"So that\'s Lady Dumbello\'s grandfather," said Crosbie, to himself,\r\nas he walked slowly round the close towards the hospital, by the\r\npath which the verger had shown him. He had no great love for Lady\r\nDumbello, who had dared to snub him,--even him. "They may make an\r\nangel of the old gentleman," he continued to say; "but they\'ll never\r\nsucceed in that way with the granddaughter."\r\n\r\nHe sauntered slowly on over a little bridge; and at the gate of the\r\nhospital he again came upon Mr. Harding. "I was going to venture in,"\r\nsaid he, "to look at the place. But perhaps I shall be intruding?"\r\n\r\n"No, no; by no means," said Mr. Harding. "Pray come in. I cannot say\r\nthat I am just at home here. I do not live here,--not now. But I know\r\nthe ways of the place well, and can make you welcome. That\'s the\r\nwarden\'s house. Perhaps we won\'t go in so early in the day, as the\r\nlady has a very large family. An excellent lady, and a dear friend of\r\nmine,--as is her husband."\r\n\r\n"And he is warden, you say?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, warden of the hospital. You see the house, sir. Very pretty,\r\nisn\'t it? Very pretty. To my idea it\'s the prettiest built house I\r\never saw."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t go quite so far as that," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"But you would if you\'d lived there twelve years, as I did. I lived\r\nin that house twelve years, and I don\'t think there\'s so sweet a spot\r\non the earth\'s surface. Did you ever see such turf as that?"\r\n\r\n"Very nice indeed," said Crosbie, who began to make a comparison\r\nwith Mrs. Dale\'s turf at the Small House, and to determine that the\r\nAllington turf was better than that of the hospital.\r\n\r\n"I had that turf laid down myself. There were borders there when I\r\nfirst came, with hollyhocks, and those sort of things. The turf was\r\nan improvement."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no doubt of that, I should say."\r\n\r\n"The turf was an improvement, certainly. And I planted those shrubs,\r\ntoo. There isn\'t such a Portugal laurel as that in the county."\r\n\r\n"Were you warden here, sir?" And Crosbie, as he asked the question,\r\nremembered that, in his very young days, he had heard of some\r\nnewspaper quarrel which had taken place about Hiram\'s hospital at\r\nBarchester.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. I was warden here for twelve years. Dear, dear, dear! If\r\nthey had put any gentleman here that was not on friendly terms with\r\nme it would have made me very unhappy,--very. But, as it is, I go in\r\nand out just as I like; almost as much as I did before they-- But\r\nthey didn\'t turn me out. There were reasons which made it best that\r\nI should resign."\r\n\r\n"And you live at the deanery now, Mr. Harding?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I live at the deanery now. But I am not dean, you know. My\r\nson-in-law, Dr. Arabin, is the dean. I have another daughter married\r\nin the neighbourhood, and can truly say that my lines have fallen to\r\nme in pleasant places."\r\n\r\nThen he took Crosbie in among the old men, into all of whose rooms\r\nhe went. It was an almshouse for aged men of the city, and before\r\nCrosbie had left him Mr. Harding had explained all the circumstances\r\nof the hospital, and of the way in which he had left it. "I didn\'t\r\nlike going, you know; I thought it would break my heart. But I could\r\nnot stay when they said such things as that;--I couldn\'t stay. And,\r\nwhat is more, I should have been wrong to stay. I see it all now.\r\nBut when I went out under that arch, Mr. Crosbie, leaning on my\r\ndaughter\'s arm, I thought that my heart would have broken." And the\r\ntears even now ran down the old man\'s cheeks as he spoke.\r\n\r\nIt was a long story, and it need not be repeated here. And there was\r\nno reason why it should have been told to Mr. Crosbie, other than\r\nthis,--that Mr. Harding was a fond garrulous old man, who loved to\r\nindulge his mind in reminiscences of the past. But this was remarked\r\nby Crosbie; that, in telling his story, no word was said by Mr.\r\nHarding injurious to any one. And yet he had been injured,--injured\r\nvery deeply. "It was all for the best," he said at last; "especially\r\nas the happiness has not been denied to me of making myself at home\r\nat the old place. I would take you into the house, which is very\r\ncomfortable,--very; only it is not always convenient early in the\r\nday, where there\'s a large family." In hearing which Crosbie was\r\nagain made to think of his own future home and limited income.\r\n\r\nHe had told the old clergyman who he was, and that he was on his way\r\nto Courcy. "Where, as I understand, I shall meet a granddaughter of\r\nyours."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; she is my grandchild. She and I have got into different\r\nwalks of life now, so that I don\'t see much of her. They tell me that\r\nshe does her duty well in that sphere of life to which it has pleased\r\nGod to call her."\r\n\r\n"That depends," thought Crosbie, "on what the duties of a viscountess\r\nmay be supposed to be." But he wished his new friend good-by, without\r\nsaying anything further as to Lady Dumbello, and, at about six\r\no\'clock in the evening, had himself driven up under the portico of\r\nCourcy Castle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nCOURCY CASTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCourcy Castle was very full. In the first place, there was a great\r\ngathering there of all the Courcy family. The earl was there,--and\r\nthe countess, of course. At this period of the year Lady De Courcy\r\nwas always at home; but the presence of the earl himself had\r\nheretofore been by no means so certain. He was a man who had been\r\nmuch given to royal visitings and attendances, to parties in the\r\nHighlands, to--no doubt necessary--prolongations of the London\r\nseason, to sojournings at certain German watering-places, convenient,\r\nprobably, in order that he might study the ways and ceremonies of\r\nGerman Courts,--and to various other absences from home, occasioned\r\nby a close pursuit of his own special aims in life; for the Earl\r\nDe Courcy had been a great courtier. But of late gout, lumbago,\r\nand perhaps also some diminution in his powers of making himself\r\ngenerally agreeable, had reconciled him to domestic duties, and the\r\nearl spent much of his time at home. The countess, in former days,\r\nhad been heard to complain of her lord\'s frequent absence. But it is\r\nhard to please some women,--and now she would not always be satisfied\r\nwith his presence.\r\n\r\nAnd all the sons and daughters were there,--excepting Lord Porlock,\r\nthe eldest, who never met his father. The earl and Lord Porlock were\r\nnot on terms, and indeed hated each other as only such fathers and\r\nsuch sons can hate. The Honourable George De Courcy was there with\r\nhis bride, he having lately performed a manifest duty, in having\r\nmarried a young woman with money. Very young she was not,--having\r\nreached some years of her life in advance of thirty; but then,\r\nneither was the Honourable George very young; and in this respect\r\nthe two were not ill-sorted. The lady\'s money had not been very\r\nmuch,--perhaps thirty thousand pounds or so. But then the Honourable\r\nGeorge\'s money had been absolutely none. Now he had an income on\r\nwhich he could live, and therefore his father and mother had forgiven\r\nhim all his sins, and taken him again to their bosom. And the\r\nmarriage was matter of great moment, for the elder scion of the house\r\nhad not yet taken to himself a wife, and the De Courcy family might\r\nhave to look to this union for an heir. The lady herself was not\r\nbeautiful, or clever, or of imposing manners--nor was she of high\r\nbirth. But neither was she ugly, nor unbearably stupid. Her manners\r\nwere, at any rate, innocent; and as to her birth,--seeing that, from\r\nthe first, she was not supposed to have had any,--no disappointment\r\nwas felt. Her father had been a coal-merchant. She was always called\r\nMrs. George, and the effort made respecting her by everybody in and\r\nabout the family was to treat her as though she were a figure of\r\na woman, a large well-dressed resemblance of a being, whom it was\r\nnecessary for certain purposes that the De Courcys should carry in\r\ntheir train. Of the Honourable George we may further observe, that,\r\nhaving been a spendthrift all his life, he had now become strictly\r\nparsimonious. Having reached the discreet age of forty, he had at\r\nlast learned that beggary was objectionable; and he, therefore,\r\ndevoted every energy of his mind to saving shillings and pence\r\nwherever pence and shillings might be saved. When first this turn\r\ncame upon him both his father and mother were delighted to observe\r\nit; but, although it had hardly yet lasted over twelve months, some\r\nevil results were beginning to appear. Though possessed of an income,\r\nhe would take no steps towards possessing himself of a house. He\r\nhung by the paternal mansion, either in town or country; drank the\r\npaternal wines, rode the paternal horses, and had even contrived\r\nto obtain his wife\'s dresses from the maternal milliner. In the\r\ncompletion of which little last success, however, some slight family\r\ndissent had showed itself.\r\n\r\nThe Honourable John, the third son, was also at Courcy. He had as yet\r\ntaken to himself no wife, and as he had not hitherto made himself\r\nconspicuously useful in any special walk of life his family were\r\nbeginning to regard him as a burden. Having no income of his own to\r\nsave, he had not copied his brother\'s virtue of parsimony; and, to\r\ntell the truth plainly, had made himself so generally troublesome to\r\nhis father, that he had been on more than one occasion threatened\r\nwith expulsion from the family roof. But it is not easy to expel a\r\nson. Human fledglings cannot be driven out of the nest like young\r\nbirds. An Honourable John turned adrift into absolute poverty will\r\nmake himself heard of in the world,--if in no other way, by his\r\nugliness as he starves. A thorough-going ne\'er-do-well in the upper\r\nclasses has eminent advantages on his side in the battle which he\r\nfights against respectability. He can\'t be sent to Australia against\r\nhis will. He can\'t be sent to the poor-house without the knowledge\r\nof all the world. He can\'t be kept out of tradesmen\'s shops; nor,\r\nwithout terrible scandal, can he be kept away from the paternal\r\nproperties. The earl had threatened, and snarled, and shown his\r\nteeth; he was an angry man, and a man who could look very angry; with\r\neyes which could almost become red, and a brow that wrinkled itself\r\nin perpendicular wrinkles, sometimes very terrible to behold. But\r\nhe was an inconsistent man, and the Honourable John had learned to\r\nmeasure his father, and in an accurate balance.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the sons first, because it is to be presumed that\r\nthey were the elder, seeing that their names were mentioned before\r\nthose of their sisters in all the peerages. But there were four\r\ndaughters,--the Ladies Amelia, Rosina, Margaretta, and Alexandrina.\r\nThey, we may say, were the flowers of the family, having so lived\r\nthat they had created none of those family feuds which had been so\r\nfrequent between their father and their brothers. They were discreet,\r\nhigh-bred women, thinking, perhaps, a little too much of their own\r\nposition in the world, and somewhat apt to put a wrong value on\r\nthose advantages which they possessed, and on those which they did\r\nnot possess. The Lady Amelia was already married, having made a\r\nsubstantial if not a brilliant match with Mr. Mortimer Gazebee, a\r\nflourishing solicitor, belonging to a firm which had for many years\r\nacted as agents to the De Courcy property. Mortimer Gazebee was now\r\nmember of Parliament for Barchester, partly through the influence\r\nof his father-in-law. That this should be so was a matter of great\r\ndisgust to the Honourable George, who thought that the seat should\r\nhave belonged to him. But as Mr. Gazebee had paid the very heavy\r\nexpenses of the election out of his own pocket, and as George De\r\nCourcy certainly could not have paid them, the justice of his claim\r\nmay be questionable. Lady Amelia Gazebee was now the happy mother of\r\nmany babies, whom she was wont to carry with her on her visits to\r\nCourcy Castle, and had become an excellent partner to her husband.\r\nHe would perhaps have liked it better if she had not spoken so\r\nfrequently to him of her own high position as the daughter of an\r\nearl, or so frequently to others of her low position as the wife of\r\nan attorney. But, on the whole, they did very well together, and Mr.\r\nGazebee had gotten from his marriage quite as much as he expected\r\nwhen he made it.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Rosina was very religious; and I do not know that she was\r\nconspicuous in any other way, unless it might be that she somewhat\r\nresembled her father in her temper. It was of the Lady Rosina that\r\nthe servants were afraid, especially with reference to that so-called\r\nday of rest which, under her dominion, had become to many of them\r\na day of restless torment. It had not always been so with the Lady\r\nRosina; but her eyes had been opened by the wife of a great church\r\ndignitary in the neighbourhood, and she had undergone regeneration.\r\nHow great may be the misery inflicted by an energetic, unmarried,\r\nhealthy woman in that condition,--a woman with no husband, or\r\nchildren, or duties, to distract her from her work--I pray that my\r\nreaders may never know.\r\n\r\nThe Lady Margaretta was her mother\'s favourite, and she was like her\r\nmother in all things,--except that her mother had been a beauty. The\r\nworld called her proud, disdainful, and even insolent; but the world\r\nwas not aware that in all that she did she was acting in accordance\r\nwith a principle which had called for much self-abnegation. She had\r\nconsidered it her duty to be a De Courcy and an earl\'s daughter at\r\nall times; and consequently she had sacrificed to her idea of duty\r\nall popularity, adulation, and such admiration as would have been\r\nawarded to her as a well-dressed, tall, fashionable, and by no means\r\nstupid young woman. To be at all times in something higher than they\r\nwho were manifestly below her in rank,--that was the effort that she\r\nwas ever making. But she had been a good daughter, assisting her\r\nmother, as best she might, in all family troubles, and never repining\r\nat the cold, colourless, unlovely life which had been vouchsafed to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAlexandrina was the beauty of the family, and was in truth the\r\nyoungest. But even she was not very young, and was beginning to make\r\nher friends uneasy lest she, too, should let the precious season\r\nof hay-harvest run by without due use of her summer\'s sun. She had,\r\nperhaps, counted too much on her beauty, which had been beauty\r\naccording to law rather than beauty according to taste, and had\r\nlooked, probably, for too bounteous a harvest. That her forehead, and\r\nnose, and cheeks, and chin were well-formed, no man could deny. Her\r\nhair was soft and plentiful. Her teeth were good, and her eyes were\r\nlong and oval. But the fault of her face was this,--that when you\r\nleft her you could not remember it. After a first acquaintance you\r\ncould meet her again and not know her. After many meetings you would\r\nfail to carry away with you any portrait of her features. But such\r\nas she had been at twenty, such was she now at thirty. Years had not\r\nrobbed her face of its regularity, or ruffled the smoothness of her\r\ntoo even forehead. Rumour had declared that on more than one, or\r\nperhaps more than two occasions, Lady Alexandrina had been already\r\ninduced to plight her troth in return for proffered love; but we all\r\nknow that Rumour, when she takes to such topics, exaggerates the\r\ntruth, and sets down much in malice. The lady was once engaged, the\r\nengagement lasting for two years, and the engagement had been broken\r\noff, owing to some money difficulties between the gentlemen of the\r\nfamilies. Since that she had become somewhat querulous, and was\r\nsupposed to be uneasy on that subject of her haymaking. Her glass\r\nand her maid assured her that her sun shone still as brightly as\r\never; but her spirit was becoming weary with waiting, and she dreaded\r\nlest she should become a terror to all, as was her sister Rosina, or\r\nan object of interest to none, as was Margaretta. It was from her\r\nespecially that this message had been sent to our friend Crosbie;\r\nfor, during the last spring in London, she and Crosbie had known\r\neach other well. Yes, my gentle readers; it is true, as your heart\r\nsuggests to you. Under such circumstances Mr. Crosbie should not have\r\ngone to Courcy Castle.\r\n\r\nSuch was the family circle of the De Courcys. Among their present\r\nguests I need not enumerate many. First and foremost in all respects\r\nwas Lady Dumbello, of whose parentage and position a few words were\r\nsaid in the last chapter. She was a lady still very young, having as\r\nyet been little more than two years married. But in those two years\r\nher triumphs had been many;--so many, that in the great world her\r\nstanding already equalled that of her celebrated mother-in-law, the\r\nMarchioness of Hartletop, who, for twenty years, had owned no greater\r\npotentate than herself in the realms of fashion. But Lady Dumbello\r\nwas every inch as great as she; and men said, and women also, that\r\nthe daughter-in-law would soon be the greater.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be hanged if I can understand how she does it," a certain noble\r\npeer had once said to Crosbie, standing at the door of Sebright\'s,\r\nduring the latter days of the last season. "She never says anything\r\nto any one. She won\'t speak ten words a whole night through."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she has an idea in her head," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"Let me tell you that she must be a very clever woman," continued the\r\nnoble peer. "No fool could do as she does. Remember, she\'s only a\r\nparson\'s daughter; and as for beauty--"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t admire her for one," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to run away with her, if you mean that," said the peer;\r\n"but she is handsome, no doubt. I wonder whether Dumbello likes it."\r\n\r\nDumbello did like it. It satisfied his ambition to be led about as\r\nthe senior lacquey in his wife\'s train. He believed himself to be\r\na great man because the world fought for his wife\'s presence; and\r\nconsidered himself to be distinguished even among the eldest sons\r\nof marquises, by the greatness reflected from the parson\'s daughter\r\nwhom he had married. He had now been brought to Courcy Castle, and\r\nfelt himself proud of his situation because Lady Dumbello had made\r\nconsiderable difficulty in according this week to the Countess De\r\nCourcy.\r\n\r\nAnd Lady Julia De Guest was already there, the sister of the other\r\nold earl who lived in the next county. She had only arrived on the\r\nday before, but had been quick in spreading the news as to Crosbie\'s\r\nengagement. "Engaged to one of the Dales, is he?" said the countess,\r\nwith a pretty little smile, which showed plainly that the matter was\r\none of no interest to herself. "Has she got any money?"\r\n\r\n"Not a shilling, I should think," said the Lady Julia.\r\n\r\n"Pretty, I suppose?" suggested the countess.\r\n\r\n"Why, yes; she is pretty--and a nice girl. I don\'t know whether her\r\nmother and uncle were very wise in encouraging Mr. Crosbie. I don\'t\r\nhear that he has anything special to recommend him,--in the way of\r\nmoney I mean."\r\n\r\n"I dare say it will come to nothing," said the countess, who liked to\r\nhear of girls being engaged and then losing their promised husbands.\r\nShe did not know that she liked it, but she did; and already had\r\npleasure in anticipating poor Lily\'s discomfiture. But not the less\r\nwas she angry with Crosbie, feeling that he was making his way into\r\nher house under false pretences.\r\n\r\nAnd Alexandrina also was angry when Lady Julia repeated the same\r\ntidings in her hearing. "I really don\'t think we care very much about\r\nit, Lady Julia," said she, with a little toss of her head. "That\'s\r\nthree times we\'ve been told of Miss Dale\'s good fortune."\r\n\r\n"The Dales are related to you, I think?" said Margaretta.\r\n\r\n"Not at all," said Lady Julia, bristling up. "The lady whom Mr.\r\nCrosbie proposes to marry is in no way connected with us. Her cousin,\r\nwho is the heir to the Allington property, is my nephew by his\r\nmother." And then the subject was dropped.\r\n\r\nCrosbie, on his arrival, was shown up into his room, told the hour\r\nof dinner, and left to his devices. He had been at the castle before,\r\nand knew the ways of the house. So he sat himself down to his table,\r\nand began a letter to Lily. But he had not proceeded far, not having\r\nas yet indeed made up his mind as to the form in which he would\r\ncommence it, but was sitting idly with the pen in his hand, thinking\r\nof Lily, and thinking also how such houses as this in which he now\r\nfound himself would be soon closed against him, when there came a rap\r\nat his door, and before he could answer the Honourable John entered\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n"Well, old fellow," said the Honourable John, "how are you?"\r\n\r\nCrosbie had been intimate with John De Courcy, but never felt for him\r\neither friendship or liking. Crosbie did not like such men as John De\r\nCourcy; but nevertheless, they called each other old fellow, poked\r\neach other\'s ribs, and were very intimate.\r\n\r\n"Heard you were here," continued the Honourable John; "so I thought I\r\nwould come up and look after you. Going to be married, ain\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Not that I know of," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"Come, we know better than that. The women have been talking about it\r\nfor the last three days. I had her name quite pat yesterday, but I\'ve\r\nforgot it now. Hasn\'t got a tanner; has she?" And the Honourable John\r\nhad now seated himself upon the table.\r\n\r\n"You seem to know a great deal more about it than I do."\r\n\r\n"It is that old woman from Guestwick who told us, then. The women\r\nwill be at you at once, you\'ll find. If there\'s nothing in it, it\'s\r\nwhat I call a d---- shame. Why should they always pull a fellow to\r\npieces in that way? They were going to marry me the other day!"\r\n\r\n"Were they indeed, though?"\r\n\r\n"To Harriet Twistleton. You know Harriet Twistleton? An uncommon fine\r\ngirl, you know. But I wasn\'t going to be caught like that. I\'m very\r\nfond of Harriet,--in my way, you know; but they don\'t catch an old\r\nbird like me with chaff."\r\n\r\n"I condole with Miss Twistleton for what she has lost."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about condoling. But upon my word that getting married\r\nis a very slow thing. Have you seen George\'s wife?"\r\n\r\nCrosbie declared that he had not as yet had that pleasure.\r\n\r\n"She\'s here now, you know. I wouldn\'t have taken her, not if she\'d\r\nhad ten times thirty thousand pounds. By Jove, no. But he likes it\r\nwell enough. Would you believe it now?--he cares for nothing on earth\r\nexcept money. You never saw such a fellow. But I\'ll tell you what,\r\nhis nose will be out of joint yet, for Porlock is going to marry. I\r\nheard it from Colepepper, who almost lives with Porlock. As soon as\r\nPorlock heard that she was in the family way he immediately made up\r\nhis mind to cut him out."\r\n\r\n"That was a great sign of brotherly love," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"I knew he\'d do it," said John; "and so I told George before he got\r\nhimself spliced. But he would go on. If he\'d remained as he was for\r\nfour or five years longer there would have been no danger;--for\r\nPorlock, you know, is leading the deuce of a life. I shouldn\'t wonder\r\nif he didn\'t reform now, and take to singing psalms or something of\r\nthat sort."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no knowing what a man may come to in this world."\r\n\r\n"By George, no. But I\'ll tell you what, they\'ll find no change in me.\r\nIf I marry it will not be with the intention of giving up life. I\r\nsay, old fellow, have you got a cigar here?"\r\n\r\n"What, to smoke up here, do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; why not? we\'re ever so far from the women."\r\n\r\n"Not whilst I am occupier of this room. Besides, it\'s time to dress\r\nfor dinner."\r\n\r\n"Is it? So it is, by George! But I mean to have a smoke first, I can\r\ntell you. So it\'s all a lie about your being engaged; eh?"\r\n\r\n"As far as I know, it is," said Crosbie. And then his friend left\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhat was he to do at once, now, this very day, as to his engagement?\r\nHe had felt sure that the report of it would be carried to Courcy by\r\nLady Julia De Guest, but he had not settled down upon any resolution\r\nas to what he would do in consequence. It had not occurred to him\r\nthat he would immediately be charged with the offence, and called\r\nupon to plead guilty or not guilty. He had never for a moment\r\nmeditated any plea of not guilty, but he was aware of an aversion\r\non his part to declare himself as engaged to Lilian Dale. It seemed\r\nthat by doing so he would cut himself off at once from all pleasure\r\nat such houses as Courcy Castle; and, as he argued to himself, why\r\nshould he not enjoy the little remnant of his bachelor life? As to\r\nhis denying his engagement to John De Courcy,--that was nothing. Any\r\none would understand that he would be justified in concealing a fact\r\nconcerning himself from such a one as he. The denial repeated from\r\nJohn\'s mouth would amount to nothing,--even among John\'s own sisters.\r\nBut now it was necessary that Crosbie should make up his mind as to\r\nwhat he would say when questioned by the ladies of the house. If he\r\nwere to deny the fact to them the denial would be very serious. And,\r\nindeed, was it possible that he should make such denial with Lady\r\nJulia opposite to him?\r\n\r\nMake such a denial! And was it the fact that he could wish to do\r\nso,--that he should think of such falsehood, and even meditate on the\r\nperpetration of such cowardice? He had held that young girl to his\r\nheart on that very morning. He had sworn to her, and had also sworn\r\nto himself, that she should have no reason for distrusting him. He\r\nhad acknowledged most solemnly to himself that, whether for good or\r\nfor ill, he was bound to her; and could it be that he was already\r\ncalculating as to the practicability of disowning her? In doing so\r\nmust he not have told himself that he was a villain? But in truth\r\nhe made no such calculation. His object was to banish the subject,\r\nif it were possible to do so; to think of some answer by which he\r\nmight create a doubt. It did not occur to him to tell the countess\r\nboldly that there was no truth whatever in the report, and that Miss\r\nDale was nothing to him. But might he not skilfully laugh off the\r\nsubject, even in the presence of Lady Julia? Men who were engaged\r\ndid so usually, and why should not he? It was generally thought that\r\nsolicitude for the lady\'s feelings should prevent a man from talking\r\nopenly of his own engagement. Then he remembered the easy freedom\r\nwith which his position had been discussed throughout the whole\r\nneighbourhood of Allington, and felt for the first time that the Dale\r\nfamily had been almost indelicate in their want of reticence. "I\r\nsuppose it was done to tie me the faster," he said to himself, as he\r\npulled out the ends of his cravat. "What a fool I was to come here,\r\nor indeed to go anywhere, after settling myself as I have done." And\r\nthen he went down into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nIt was almost a relief to him when he found that he was not charged\r\nwith his sin at once. He himself had been so full of the subject that\r\nhe had expected to be attacked at the moment of his entrance. He was,\r\nhowever, greeted without any allusion to the matter. The countess, in\r\nher own quiet way, shook hands with him as though she had seen him\r\nonly the day before. The earl, who was seated in his arm-chair, asked\r\nsome one, out loud, who the stranger was, and then, with two fingers\r\nput forth, muttered some apology for a welcome. But Crosbie was quite\r\nup to that kind of thing. "How do, my lord?" he said, turning his\r\nface away to some one else as he spoke; and then he took no further\r\nnotice of the master of the house. "Not know him, indeed!" Crippled\r\nthough he was by his matrimonial bond, Crosbie felt that, at any rate\r\nas yet, he was the earl\'s equal in social importance. After that, he\r\nfound himself in the back part of the drawing-room, away from the\r\nelder people, standing with Lady Alexandrina, with Miss Gresham, a\r\ncousin of the De Courcys, and sundry other of the younger portion of\r\nthe assembled community.\r\n\r\n"So you have Lady Dumbello here?" said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; the dear creature!" said Lady Margaretta. "It was so good\r\nof her to come, you know."\r\n\r\n"She positively refused the Duchess of St. Bungay," said Alexandrina.\r\n"I hope you perceive how good we\'ve been to you in getting you to\r\nmeet her. People have actually asked to come."\r\n\r\n"I am grateful; but, in truth, my gratitude has more to do with\r\nCourcy Castle and its habitual inmates, than with Lady Dumbello. Is\r\nhe here?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes! he\'s in the room somewhere. There he is, standing up by\r\nLady Clandidlem. He always stands in that way before dinner. In the\r\nevening he sits down much after the same fashion."\r\n\r\nCrosbie had seen him on first entering the room, and had seen every\r\nindividual in it. He knew better than to omit the duty of that\r\nscrutinizing glance; but it sounded well in his line not to have\r\nobserved Lord Dumbello.\r\n\r\n"And her ladyship is not down?" said he.\r\n\r\n"She is generally last," said Lady Margaretta.\r\n\r\n"And yet she has always three women to dress her," said Alexandrina.\r\n\r\n"But when finished, what a success it is!" said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"Indeed it is!" said Margaretta, with energy. Then the door was\r\nopened, and Lady Dumbello entered the room.\r\n\r\nThere was immediately a commotion among them all. Even the gouty old\r\nlord shuffled up out of his chair, and tried, with a grin, to look\r\nsweet and pleasant. The countess came forward, looking very sweet\r\nand pleasant, making little complimentary speeches, to which the\r\nviscountess answered simply by a gracious smile. Lady Clandidlem,\r\nthough she was very fat and heavy, left the viscount, and got up\r\nto join the group. Baron Potsneuf, a diplomatic German of great\r\ncelebrity, crossed his hands upon his breast and made a low bow. The\r\nHonourable George, who had stood silent for the last quarter of an\r\nhour, suggested to her ladyship that she must have found the air\r\nrather cold; and the Ladies Margaretta and Alexandrina fluttered\r\nup with little complimentary speeches to their dear Lady Dumbello,\r\nhoping this and beseeching that, as though the "Woman in White"\r\nbefore them had been the dearest friend of their infancy.\r\n\r\nShe was a woman in white, being dressed in white silk, with white\r\nlace over it, and with no other jewels upon her person than diamonds.\r\nVery beautifully she was dressed; doing infinite credit, no doubt, to\r\nthose three artists who had, between them, succeeded in turning her\r\nout of hand. And her face, also, was beautiful, with a certain cold,\r\ninexpressive beauty. She walked up the room very slowly, smiling here\r\nand smiling there; but still with very faint smiles, and took the\r\nplace which her hostess indicated to her. One word she said to the\r\ncountess and two to the earl. Beyond that she did not open her lips.\r\nAll the homage paid to her she received as though it were clearly her\r\ndue. She was not in the least embarrassed, nor did she show herself\r\nto be in the slightest degree ashamed of her own silence. She did\r\nnot look like a fool, nor was she even taken for a fool; but she\r\ncontributed nothing to society but her cold, hard beauty, her gait,\r\nand her dress. We may say that she contributed enough, for society\r\nacknowledged itself to be deeply indebted to her.\r\n\r\nThe only person in the room who did not move at Lady Dumbello\'s\r\nentrance was her husband. But he remained unmoved from no want of\r\nenthusiasm. A spark of pleasure actually beamed in his eye as he saw\r\nthe triumphant entrance of his wife. He felt that he had made a match\r\nthat was becoming to him as a great nobleman, and that the world was\r\nacknowledging that he had done his duty. And yet Lady Dumbello had\r\nbeen simply the daughter of a country parson, of a clergyman who had\r\nreached no higher rank than that of an archdeacon. "How wonderfully\r\nwell that woman has educated her," the countess said that evening\r\nin her dressing-room, to Margaretta. The woman alluded to was Mrs.\r\nGrantly, the wife of the parson and mother of Lady Dumbello.\r\n\r\nThe old earl was very cross because destiny and the table of\r\nprecedence required him to take out Lady Clandidlem to dinner. He\r\nalmost insulted her, as she kindly endeavoured to assist him in his\r\ninfirm step rather than to lean upon him.\r\n\r\n"Ugh!" he said, "it\'s a bad arrangement that makes two old people\r\nlike you and me be sent out together to help each other."\r\n\r\n"Speak for yourself," said her ladyship, with a laugh. "I, at any\r\nrate, can get about without any assistance,"--which, indeed, was true\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n"It\'s well for you!" growled the earl, as he got himself into his\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nAnd after that he endeavoured to solace his pain by a flirtation with\r\nLady Dumbello on his left. The earl\'s smiles and the earl\'s teeth,\r\nwhen he whispered naughty little nothings to pretty young women, were\r\nphenomena at which men might marvel. Whatever those naughty nothings\r\nwere on the present occasion, Lady Dumbello took them all with\r\nplacidity, smiling graciously, but speaking hardly more than\r\nmonosyllables.\r\n\r\nLady Alexandrina fell to Crosbie\'s lot, and he felt gratified that\r\nit was so. It might be necessary for him, as a married man, to give\r\nup such acquaintances as the De Courcys, but he should like, if\r\npossible, to maintain a friendship with Lady Alexandrina. What a\r\nfriend Lady Alexandrina would be for Lily, if any such friendship\r\nwere only possible! What an advantage would such an alliance confer\r\nupon that dear little girl;--for, after all, though the dear little\r\ngirl\'s attractions were very great, he could not but admit to himself\r\nthat she wanted a something,--a way of holding herself and of\r\nspeaking, which some people call style. Lily might certainly learn\r\na great deal from Lady Alexandrina; and it was this conviction,\r\nno doubt, which made him so sedulous in pleasing that lady on the\r\npresent occasion.\r\n\r\nAnd she, as it seemed, was well inclined to be pleased. She said no\r\nword to him during dinner about Lily; and yet she spoke about the\r\nDales, and about Allington, showing that she knew in what quarters\r\nhe had been staying, and then she alluded to their last parties in\r\nLondon,--those occasions on which, as Crosbie now remembered, the\r\nintercourse between them had almost been tender. It was manifest to\r\nhim that at any rate she did not wish to quarrel with him. It was\r\nmanifest, also, that she had some little hesitation in speaking to\r\nhim about his engagement. He did not for a moment doubt that she was\r\naware of it. And in this way matters went on between them till the\r\nladies left the room.\r\n\r\n"So you\'re going to be married, too," said the Honourable George, by\r\nwhose side Crosbie found himself seated when the ladies were gone.\r\nCrosbie was employing himself upon a walnut, and did not find it\r\nnecessary to make any answer.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the best thing a fellow can do," continued George; "that is, if\r\nhe has been careful to look to the main chance,--if he hasn\'t been\r\ncaught napping, you know. It doesn\'t do for a man to go hanging on by\r\nnothing till he finds himself an old man."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve feathered your own nest, at any rate."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I\'ve got something in the scramble, and I mean to keep it.\r\nWhere will John be when the governor goes off the hooks? Porlock\r\nwouldn\'t give him a bit of bread and cheese and a glass of beer to\r\nsave his life;--that is to say, not if he wanted it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m told your elder brother is going to be married."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve heard that from John. He\'s spreading that about everywhere to\r\ntake a rise out of me. I don\'t believe a word of it. Porlock never\r\nwas a marrying man;--and, what\'s more, from all I hear, I don\'t think\r\nhe\'ll live long."\r\n\r\nIn this way Crosbie escaped from his own difficulty; and when he rose\r\nfrom the dinner-table had not as yet been driven to confess anything\r\nto his own discredit.\r\n\r\nBut the evening was not yet over. When he returned to the\r\ndrawing-room he endeavoured to avoid any conversation with the\r\ncountess herself, believing that the attack would more probably come\r\nfrom her than from her daughter. He, therefore, got into conversation\r\nfirst with one and then with another of the girls, till at last he\r\nfound himself again alone with Alexandrina.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Crosbie," she said, in a low voice, as they were standing\r\ntogether over one of the distant tables, with their backs to the rest\r\nof the company, "I want you to tell me something about Miss Lilian\r\nDale."\r\n\r\n"About Miss Lilian Dale!" he said, repeating her words.\r\n\r\n"Is she very pretty?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; she certainly is pretty."\r\n\r\n"And very nice, and attractive, and clever,--and all that is\r\ndelightful? Is she perfect?"\r\n\r\n"She is very attractive," said he; "but I don\'t think she\'s perfect."\r\n\r\n"And what are her faults?"\r\n\r\n"That question is hardly fair, is it? Suppose any one were to ask me\r\nwhat were your faults, do you think I should answer the question?"\r\n\r\n"I am quite sure you would, and make a very long list of them, too.\r\nBut as to Miss Dale, you ought to think her perfect. If a gentleman\r\nwere engaged to me, I should expect him to swear before all the world\r\nthat I was the very pink of perfection."\r\n\r\n"But supposing the gentleman were not engaged to you?"\r\n\r\n"That would be a different thing."\r\n\r\n"I am not engaged to you," said Crosbie. "Such happiness and such\r\nhonour are, I fear, very far beyond my reach. But, nevertheless, I am\r\nprepared to testify as to your perfection anywhere."\r\n\r\n"And what would Miss Dale say?"\r\n\r\n"Allow me to assure you that such opinions as I may choose to express\r\nof my friends will be my own opinions, and not depend on those of any\r\none else."\r\n\r\n"And you think, then, that you are not bound to be enslaved as yet?\r\nHow many more months of such freedom are you to enjoy?"\r\n\r\nCrosbie remained silent for a minute before he answered, and then he\r\nspoke in a serious voice. "Lady Alexandrina," said he, "I would beg\r\nfrom you a great favour."\r\n\r\n"What is the favour, Mr. Crosbie?"\r\n\r\n"I am quite in earnest. Will you be good enough, kind enough, enough\r\nmy friend, not to connect my name again with that of Miss Dale while\r\nI am here?"\r\n\r\n"Has there been a quarrel?"\r\n\r\n"No; there has been no quarrel. I cannot explain to you now why I\r\nmake this request; but to you I will explain it before I go."\r\n\r\n"Explain it to me!"\r\n\r\n"I have regarded you as more than an acquaintance,--as a friend. In\r\ndays now past there were moments when I was almost rash enough to\r\nhope that I might have said even more than that. I confess that I had\r\nno warrant for such hopes, but I believe that I may still look on you\r\nas a friend?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, certainly," said Alexandrina, in a very low voice, and with\r\na certain amount of tenderness in her tone. "I have always regarded\r\nyou as a friend."\r\n\r\n"And therefore I venture to make the request. The subject is not one\r\non which I can speak openly, without regret, at the present moment.\r\nBut to you, at least, I promise that I will explain it all before I\r\nleave Courcy."\r\n\r\nHe at any rate succeeded in mystifying Lady Alexandrina. "I don\'t\r\nbelieve he is engaged a bit," she said to Lady Amelia Gazebee that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, my dear. Lady Julia wouldn\'t speak of it in that certain\r\nway if she didn\'t know. Of course he doesn\'t wish to have it talked\r\nabout."\r\n\r\n"If ever he has been engaged to her, he has broken it off again,"\r\nsaid Lady Alexandrina.\r\n\r\n"I dare say he will, my dear, if you give him encouragement," said\r\nthe married sister, with great sisterly good-nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nLILY DALE\'S FIRST LOVE-LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrosbie was rather proud of himself when he went to bed. He had\r\nsucceeded in baffling the charge made against him, without saying\r\nanything as to which his conscience need condemn him. So, at least,\r\nhe then told himself. The impression left by what he had said would\r\nbe that there had been some question of an engagement between him and\r\nLilian Dale, but that nothing at this moment was absolutely fixed.\r\nBut in the morning his conscience was not quite so clear. What would\r\nLily think and say if she knew it all? Could he dare to tell her, or\r\nto tell any one the real state of his mind?\r\n\r\nAs he lay in bed, knowing that an hour remained to him before he need\r\nencounter the perils of his tub, he felt that he hated Courcy Castle\r\nand its inmates. Who was there, among them all, that was comparable\r\nto Mrs. Dale and her daughters? He detested both George and John.\r\nHe loathed the earl. As to the countess herself, he was perfectly\r\nindifferent, regarding her as a woman whom it was well to know, but\r\nas one only to be known as the mistress of Courcy Castle and a house\r\nin London. As to the daughters, he had ridiculed them all from time\r\nto time--even Alexandrina, whom he now professed to love. Perhaps\r\nin some sort of way he had a weak fondness for her;--but it was a\r\nfondness that had never touched his heart. He could measure the\r\nwhole thing at its worth,--Courcy Castle with its privileges, Lady\r\nDumbello, Lady Clandidlem, and the whole of it. He knew that he had\r\nbeen happier on that lawn at Allington, and more contented with\r\nhimself, than ever he had been even under Lady Hartletop\'s splendid\r\nroof in Shropshire. Lady Dumbello was satisfied with these things,\r\neven in the inmost recesses of her soul; but he was not a male Lady\r\nDumbello. He knew that there was something better, and that that\r\nsomething was within his reach.\r\n\r\nBut, nevertheless, the air of Courcy was too much for him. In arguing\r\nthe matter with himself he regarded himself as one infected with\r\na leprosy from which there could be no recovery, and who should,\r\ntherefore, make his whole life suitable to the circumstances of that\r\nleprosy. It was of no use for him to tell himself that the Small\r\nHouse at Allington was better than Courcy Castle. Satan knew that\r\nheaven was better than hell; but he found himself to be fitter for\r\nthe latter place. Crosbie ridiculed Lady Dumbello, even there among\r\nher friends, with all the cutting words that his wit could find; but,\r\nnevertheless, the privilege of staying in the same house with her was\r\ndear to him. It was the line of life into which he had fallen, and\r\nhe confessed inwardly that the struggle to extricate himself would\r\nbe too much for him. All that had troubled him while he was yet at\r\nAllington, but it overwhelmed him almost with dismay beneath the\r\nhangings of Courcy Castle.\r\n\r\nHad he not better run from the place at once? He had almost\r\nacknowledged to himself that he repented his engagement with Lilian\r\nDale, but he still was resolved that he would fulfil it. He was bound\r\nin honour to marry "that little girl," and he looked sternly up at\r\nthe drapery over his head, as he assured himself that he was a man of\r\nhonour. Yes; he would sacrifice himself. As he had been induced to\r\npledge his word, he would not go back from it. He was too much of a\r\nman for that!\r\n\r\nBut had he not been wrong to refuse the result of Lily\'s wisdom when\r\nshe told him in the field that it would be better for them to part?\r\nHe did not tell himself that he had refused her offer merely because\r\nhe had not the courage to accept it on the spur of the moment. No.\r\n"He had been too good to the poor girl to take her at her word." It\r\nwas thus he argued on the matter within his own breast. He had been\r\ntoo true to her; and now the effect would be that they would both be\r\nunhappy for life! He could not live in content with a family upon a\r\nsmall income. He was well aware of that. No one could be harder upon\r\nhim in that matter than was he himself. But it was too late now to\r\nremedy the ill effects of an early education.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that he debated the matter as he lay in\r\nbed,--contradicting one argument by another over and over again; but\r\nstill in all of them teaching himself to think that this engagement\r\nof his was a misfortune. Poor Lily! Her last words to him had\r\nconveyed an assurance that she would never distrust him. And she\r\nalso, as she lay wakeful in her bed on this the first morning of his\r\nabsence, thought much of their mutual vows. How true she would be to\r\nthem! How she would be his wife with all her heart and spirit! It was\r\nnot only that she would love him;--but in her love she would serve\r\nhim to her utmost; serve him as regarded this world, and if possible\r\nas regarded the next.\r\n\r\n"Bell," she said, "I wish you were going to be married too."\r\n\r\n"Thank\'ye, dear," said Bell. "Perhaps I shall some day."\r\n\r\n"Ah; but I\'m not joking. It seems such a serious thing. And I can\'t\r\nexpect you to talk to me about it now as you would if you were in the\r\nsame position yourself. Do you think I shall make him happy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do, certainly."\r\n\r\n"Happier than he would be with any one else that he might meet? I\r\ndare not think that. I think I could give him up to-morrow, if I\r\ncould see any one that would suit him better." What would Lily have\r\nsaid had she been made acquainted with all the fascinations of Lady\r\nAlexandrina De Courcy?\r\n\r\nThe countess was very civil to him, saying nothing about his\r\nengagement, but still talking to him a good deal about his sojourn\r\nat Allington. Crosbie was a pleasant man for ladies in a large house.\r\nThough a sportsman, he was not so keen a sportsman as to be always\r\nout with the gamekeepers. Though a politician, he did not sacrifice\r\nhis mornings to the perusal of blue-books or the preparation of party\r\ntactics. Though a reading man, he did not devote himself to study.\r\nThough a horseman, he was not often to be found in the stables. He\r\ncould supply conversation when it was wanted, and could take himself\r\nout of the way when his presence among the women was not needed.\r\nBetween breakfast and lunch on the day following his arrival he\r\ntalked a good deal to the countess, and made himself very agreeable.\r\nShe continued to ridicule him gently for his prolonged stay among so\r\nprimitive and rural a tribe of people as the Dales, and he bore her\r\nlittle sarcasm with the utmost good-humour.\r\n\r\n"Six weeks at Allington without a move! Why, Mr. Crosbie, you must\r\nhave felt yourself to be growing there."\r\n\r\n"So I did--like an ancient tree. Indeed, I was so rooted that I could\r\nhardly get away."\r\n\r\n"Was the house full of people all the time?"\r\n\r\n"There was nobody there but Bernard Dale, Lady Julia\'s nephew."\r\n\r\n"Quite a case of Damon and Pythias. Fancy your going down to\r\nthe shades of Allington to enjoy the uninterrupted pleasures of\r\nfriendship for six weeks."\r\n\r\n"Friendship and the partridges."\r\n\r\n"There was nothing else, then?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed there was. There was a widow with two very nice daughters,\r\nliving, not exactly in the same house, but on the same grounds."\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed. That makes such a difference; doesn\'t it? You are not a\r\nman to bear much privation on the score of partridges, nor a great\r\ndeal, I imagine, for friendship. But when you talk of pretty girls--"\r\n\r\n"It makes a difference, doesn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"A very great difference. I think I have heard of that Mrs. Dale\r\nbefore. And so her girls are nice?"\r\n\r\n"Very nice indeed."\r\n\r\n"Play croquet, I suppose, and eat syllabub on the lawn? But, really,\r\ndidn\'t you get very tired of it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no. I was happy as the day was long."\r\n\r\n"Going about with a crook, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Not exactly a live crook; but doing all that kind of thing. I\r\nlearned a great deal about pigs."\r\n\r\n"Under the guidance of Miss Dale?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; under the guidance of Miss Dale."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure one is very much obliged to you for tearing yourself away\r\nfrom such charms, and coming to such unromantic people as we are.\r\nBut I fancy men always do that sort of thing once or twice in their\r\nlives,--and then they talk of their souvenirs. I suppose it won\'t go\r\nbeyond a souvenir with you."\r\n\r\nThis was a direct question, but still admitted of a fencing answer.\r\n"It has, at any rate, given me one," said he, "which will last me my\r\nlife!"\r\n\r\nThe countess was quite contented. That Lady Julia\'s statement was\r\naltogether true she had never for a moment doubted. That Crosbie\r\nshould become engaged to a young lady in the country, whereas he had\r\nshown signs of being in love with her daughter in London, was not\r\nat all wonderful. Nor, in her eyes, did such practice amount to any\r\ngreat sin. Men did so daily, and girls were prepared for their so\r\ndoing. A man in her eyes was not to be regarded as safe from attack\r\nbecause he was engaged. Let the young lady who took upon herself to\r\nown him have an eye to that. When she looked back on the past careers\r\nof her own flock, she had to reckon more than one such disappointment\r\nfor her own daughters. Others besides Alexandrina had been so\r\ntreated. Lady De Courcy had had her grand hopes respecting her\r\ngirls, and after them moderate hopes, and again after them bitter\r\ndisappointments. Only one had been married, and she was married to\r\nan attorney. It was not to be supposed that she would have any very\r\nhigh-toned feelings as to Lily\'s rights in this matter.\r\n\r\nSuch a man as Crosbie was certainly no great match for an earl\'s\r\ndaughter. Such a marriage, indeed, would, one may say, be but a poor\r\ntriumph. When the countess, during the last season in town, had\r\nobserved how matters were going with Alexandrina, she had cautioned\r\nher child, taking her to task for her imprudence. But the child\r\nhad been at this work for fourteen years, and was weary of it. Her\r\nsisters had been at the work longer, and had almost given it up in\r\ndespair. Alexandrina did not tell her parent that her heart was now\r\nbeyond her control, and that she had devoted herself to Crosbie for\r\never; but she pouted, saying that she knew very well what she was\r\nabout, scolding her mother in return, and making Lady De Courcy\r\nperceive that the struggle was becoming very weary. And then there\r\nwere other considerations. Mr. Crosbie had not much certainly in\r\nhis own possession, but he was a man out of whom something might be\r\nmade by family influence and his own standing. He was not a hopeless,\r\nponderous man, whom no leaven could raise. He was one of whose\r\nposition in society the countess and her daughters need not be\r\nashamed. Lady De Courcy had given no expressed consent to the\r\narrangement, but it had come to be understood between her and her\r\ndaughter that the scheme was to be entertained as admissible.\r\n\r\nThen came these tidings of the little girl down at Allington. She\r\nfelt no anger against Crosbie. To be angry on such a subject would\r\nbe futile, foolish, and almost indecorous. It was a part of the game\r\nwhich was as natural to her as fielding is to a cricketer. One cannot\r\nhave it all winnings at any game. Whether Crosbie should eventually\r\nbecome her own son-in-law or not it came to her naturally, as a part\r\nof her duty in life, to bowl down the stumps of that young lady at\r\nAllington. If Miss Dale knew the game well and could protect her own\r\nwicket, let her do so.\r\n\r\nShe had no doubt as to Crosbie\'s engagement with Lilian Dale, but\r\nshe had as little as to his being ashamed of that engagement. Had\r\nhe really cared for Miss Dale he would not have left her to come to\r\nCourcy Castle. Had he been really resolved to marry her, he would not\r\nhave warded all questions respecting his engagement with fictitious\r\nanswers. He had amused himself with Lily Dale, and it was to be hoped\r\nthat the young lady had not thought very seriously about it. That was\r\nthe most charitable light in which Lady De Courcy was disposed to\r\nregard the question.\r\n\r\nIt behoved Crosbie to write to Lily Dale before dinner. He had\r\npromised to do so immediately on his arrival, and he was aware that\r\nhe would be regarded as being already one day beyond his promise.\r\nLily had told him that she would live upon his letters, and it was\r\nabsolutely necessary that he should furnish her with her first meal.\r\nSo he betook himself to his room in sufficient time before dinner,\r\nand got out his pen, ink, and paper.\r\n\r\nHe got out his pen, ink, and paper, and then he found that his\r\ndifficulties were beginning. I beg that it may be understood that\r\nCrosbie was not altogether a villain. He could not sit down and write\r\na letter as coming from his heart, of which as he wrote it he knew\r\nthe words to be false. He was an ungenerous, worldly, inconstant man,\r\nvery prone to think well of himself, and to give himself credit for\r\nvirtues which he did not possess; but he could not be false with\r\npremeditated cruelty to a woman he had sworn to love. He could\r\nnot write an affectionate, warm-hearted letter to Lily, without\r\nbringing himself, at any rate for the time, to feel towards her in an\r\naffectionate, warm-hearted way. Therefore he now sat himself to work,\r\nwhile his pen yet remained dry in his hand, to remodel his thoughts,\r\nwhich had been turned against Lily and Allington by the craft of Lady\r\nDe Courcy. It takes some time before a man can do this. He has to\r\nstruggle with himself in a very uncomfortable way, making efforts\r\nwhich are often unsuccessful. It is sometimes easier to lift a couple\r\nof hundredweights than to raise a few thoughts in one\'s mind which at\r\nother moments will come galloping in without a whistle.\r\n\r\nHe had just written the date of his letter when a little tap came at\r\nhis door, and it was opened.\r\n\r\n"I say, Crosbie," said the Honourable John, "didn\'t you say something\r\nyesterday about a cigar before dinner?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word," said Crosbie, in rather an angry tone.\r\n\r\n"Then it must have been me," said John. "But bring your case with\r\nyou, and come down to the harness-room, if you won\'t smoke here. I\'ve\r\nhad a regular little snuggery fitted up there; and we can go in and\r\nsee the fellows making up the horses."\r\n\r\nCrosbie wished the Honourable John at the mischief.\r\n\r\n"I have letters to write," said he. "Besides, I never smoke before\r\ndinner."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense. I\'ve smoked hundreds of cigars with you before\r\ndinner. Are you going to turn curmudgeon, too, like George and the\r\nrest of them? I don\'t know what\'s coming to the world! I suppose the\r\nfact is, that little girl at Allington won\'t let you smoke."\r\n\r\n"The little girl at Allington--" began Crosbie; and then he reflected\r\nthat it would not be well for him to say anything to his present\r\ncompanion about that little girl. "I\'ll tell you what it is," said\r\nhe. "I really have got letters to write which must go by this post.\r\nThere\'s my cigar-case on the dressing-table."\r\n\r\n"I hope it will be long before I\'m brought to such a state," said\r\nJohn, taking up the cigars in his hand.\r\n\r\n"Let me have the case back," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"A present from the little girl, I suppose?" said John. "All right,\r\nold fellow! you shall have it."\r\n\r\n"There would be a nice brother-in-law for a man," said Crosbie to\r\nhimself, as the door closed behind the retreating scion of the De\r\nCourcy family. And then, again, he took up his pen. The letter must\r\nbe written, and therefore he threw himself upon the table, resolved\r\nthat the words should come and the paper be filled.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Courcy Castle, October, 186--.\r\n\r\n   DEAREST LILY,--This is the first letter I ever wrote\r\n   to you, except those little notes when I sent you my\r\n   compliments discreetly,--and it sounds so odd. You will\r\n   think that this does not come as soon as it should; but\r\n   the truth is that after all I only got in here just before\r\n   dinner yesterday. I stayed ever so long in Barchester,\r\n   and came across such a queer character. For you must\r\n   know I went to church, and afterwards fraternized with\r\n   the clergyman who did the service; such a gentle old\r\n   soul,--and, singularly enough, he is the grandfather of\r\n   Lady Dumbello, who is staying here. I wonder what you\'d\r\n   think of Lady Dumbello, or how you\'d like to be shut up in\r\n   the same house with her for a week?\r\n\r\n   But with reference to my staying at Barchester, I must\r\n   tell you the truth now, though I was a gross impostor the\r\n   day that I went away. I wanted to avoid a parting on that\r\n   last morning, and therefore I started much sooner than\r\n   I need have done. I know you will be very angry with me;\r\n   but open confession is good for the soul. You frustrated\r\n   all my little plan by your early rising; and as I saw\r\n   you standing on the terrace, looking after us as we went,\r\n   I acknowledged that you had been right, and that I was\r\n   wrong. When the time came, I was very glad to have you\r\n   with me at the last moment.\r\n\r\n   My own dearest Lily, you cannot think how different this\r\n   place is from the two houses at Allington, or how much I\r\n   prefer the sort of life which belongs to the latter. I\r\n   know that I have been what the world calls worldly, but\r\n   you will have to cure me of that. I have questioned myself\r\n   very much since I left you, and I do not think that I am\r\n   quite beyond the reach of a cure. At any rate, I will\r\n   put myself trustingly into the doctor\'s hands. I know it\r\n   is hard for a man to change his habits; but I can with\r\n   truth say this for myself, that I was happy at Allington,\r\n   enjoying every hour of the day, and that here I am ennuye\r\n   by everybody and nearly by everything. One of the girls of\r\n   the house I do like; but as to other people, I can hardly\r\n   find a companion among them, let alone a friend. However,\r\n   it would not have done for me to have broken away from all\r\n   such alliances too suddenly.\r\n\r\n   When I get up to London--and now I really am anxious to\r\n   get there--I can write to you more at my ease, and more\r\n   freely than I do here. I know that I am hardly myself\r\n   among these people,--or rather, I am hardly myself as\r\n   you know me, and as I hope you always will know me. But,\r\n   nevertheless, I am not so overcome by the miasma but what\r\n   I can tell you how truly I love you. Even though my spirit\r\n   should be here, which it is not, my heart would be on the\r\n   Allington lawns. That dear lawn and that dear bridge!\r\n\r\n   Give my kind love to Bell and your mother. I feel already\r\n   that I might almost say my mother. And Lily, my darling,\r\n   write to me at once. I expect your letters to me to be\r\n   longer, and better, and brighter than mine to you. But I\r\n   will endeavour to make mine nicer when I get back to town.\r\n\r\n   God bless you. Yours, with all my heart,\r\n\r\n   A. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he had waxed warm with his writing he had forced himself to\r\nbe affectionate, and, as he flattered himself, frank and candid.\r\nNevertheless, he was partly conscious that he was preparing for\r\nhimself a mode of escape in those allusions of his to his own\r\nworldliness; if escape should ultimately be necessary. "I have\r\ntried," he would then say; "I have struggled honestly, with my best\r\nefforts for success; but I am not good enough for such success." I do\r\nnot intend to say that he wrote with a premeditated intention of thus\r\nusing his words; but as he wrote them he could not keep himself from\r\nreflecting that they might be used in that way.\r\n\r\nHe read his letter over, felt satisfied with it, and resolved that\r\nhe might now free his mind from that consideration for the next\r\nforty-eight hours. Whatever might be his sins he had done his duty by\r\nLily! And with this comfortable reflection he deposited his letter in\r\nthe Courcy Castle letter-box.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE SQUIRE MAKES A VISIT TO THE SMALL HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: (untitled)]\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale acknowledged to herself that she had not much ground for\r\nhoping that she should ever find in Crosbie\'s house much personal\r\nhappiness for her future life. She did not dislike Mr. Crosbie, nor\r\nin any great degree mistrust him; but she had seen enough of him to\r\nmake her certain that Lily\'s future home in London could not be a\r\nhome for her. He was worldly, or, at least, a man of the world. He\r\nwould be anxious to make the most of his income, and his life would\r\nbe one long struggle, not perhaps for money, but for those things\r\nwhich money only can give. There are men to whom eight hundred a year\r\nis great wealth, and houses to which it brings all the comforts that\r\nlife requires. But Crosbie was not such a man, nor would his house be\r\nsuch a house. Mrs. Dale hoped that Lily would be happy with him, and\r\nsatisfied with his modes of life, and she strove to believe that such\r\nwould be the case; but as regarded herself she was forced to confess\r\nthat in such a marriage her child would be much divided from her.\r\nThat pleasant abode to which she had long looked forward that she\r\nmight have a welcome there in coming years should be among fields and\r\ntrees, not in some narrow London street. Lily must now become a city\r\nlady; but Bell would still be left to her, and it might still be\r\nhoped that Bell would find for herself some country home.\r\n\r\nSince the day on which Lily had first told her mother of her\r\nengagement, Mrs. Dale had found herself talking much more fully and\r\nmore frequently with Bell than with her younger daughter. As long as\r\nCrosbie was at Allington this was natural enough. He and Lily were of\r\ncourse together, while Bell remained with her mother. But the same\r\nstate of things continued even after Crosbie was gone. It was not\r\nthat there was any coolness or want of affection between the mother\r\nand daughter, but that Lily\'s heart was full of her lover, and\r\nthat Mrs. Dale, though she had given her cordial consent to the\r\nmarriage, felt that she had but few points of sympathy with her\r\nfuture son-in-law. She had never said, even to herself, that she\r\ndisliked him; nay, she had sometimes declared to herself that she\r\nwas fond of him. But, in truth, he was not a man after her own heart.\r\nHe was not one who could ever be to her as her own son and her own\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nBut she and Bell would pass hours together talking of Lily\'s\r\nprospects. "It seems so strange to me," said Mrs. Dale, "that she\r\nof all girls should have been fancied by such a man as Mr. Crosbie,\r\nor that she should have liked him. I cannot imagine Lily living in\r\nLondon."\r\n\r\n"If he is good and affectionate to her she will be happy wherever he\r\nis," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"I hope so;--I\'m sure I hope so. But it seems as though she will be\r\nso far separated from us. It is not the distance, but the manner of\r\nlife which makes the separation. I hope you\'ll never be taken so far\r\nfrom me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I shall allow myself to be taken up to London," said\r\nBell, laughing. "But one can never tell. If I do you must follow us,\r\nmamma."\r\n\r\n"I do not want another Mr. Crosbie for you, dear."\r\n\r\n"But perhaps I may want one for myself. You need not tremble quite\r\nyet, however. Apollos do not come this road every day."\r\n\r\n"Poor Lily! Do you remember when she first called him Apollo? I do,\r\nwell. I remember his coming here the day after Bernard brought him\r\ndown, and how you were playing on the lawn, while I was in the other\r\ngarden. I little thought then what it would come to."\r\n\r\n"But, mamma, you don\'t regret it?"\r\n\r\n"Not if it\'s to make her happy. If she can be happy with him, of\r\ncourse I shall not regret it; not though he were to take her to the\r\nworld\'s end away from us. What else have I to look for but that she\r\nand you should both be happy?"\r\n\r\n"Men in London are happy with their wives as well as men in the\r\ncountry."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; of all women I should be the first to acknowledge that."\r\n\r\n"And as to Adolphus himself, I do not know why we should distrust\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"No, my dear; there is no reason. If I did distrust him, I should not\r\nhave given so ready an assent to the marriage. But, nevertheless--"\r\n\r\n"The truth is, you don\'t like him, mamma."\r\n\r\n"Not so cordially as I hope I may like any man whom you may choose\r\nfor your husband."\r\n\r\nAnd Lily, though she said nothing on the subject to Mrs. Dale, felt\r\nthat her mother was in some degree estranged from her. Crosbie\'s name\r\nwas frequently mentioned between them, but in the tone of Mrs. Dale\'s\r\nvoice, and in her manner when she spoke of him, there was lacking\r\nthat enthusiasm and heartiness which real sympathy would have\r\nproduced. Lily did not analyse her own feelings, or closely make\r\ninquiry as to those of her mother, but she perceived that it was not\r\nall as she would have wished it to have been. "I know mamma does not\r\nlove him," she said to Bell on the evening of the day on which she\r\nreceived Crosbie\'s first letter.\r\n\r\n"Not as you do, Lily; but she does love him."\r\n\r\n"Not as I do! To say that is nonsense, Bell; of course she does not\r\nlove him as I do. But the truth is she does not love him at all. Do\r\nyou think I cannot see it?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid that you see too much."\r\n\r\n"She never says a word against him; but if she really liked him she\r\nwould sometimes say a word in his favour. I do not think she would\r\never mention his name unless you or I spoke of him before her. If she\r\ndid not approve of him, why did she not say so sooner?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s hardly fair upon mamma," said Bell, with some earnestness.\r\n"She does not disapprove of him, and she never did. You know mamma\r\nwell enough to be sure that she would not interfere with us in such a\r\nmatter without very strong reason. As regards Mr. Crosbie, she gave\r\nher consent without a moment\'s hesitation."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she did."\r\n\r\n"How can you say, then, that she disapproves of him?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean to find fault with mamma. Perhaps it will come all\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"It will come all right." But Bell, though she made this very\r\nsatisfactory promise, was as well aware as either of the others that\r\nthe family would be divided when Crosbie should have married Lily and\r\ntaken her off to London.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Mrs. Dale and Bell were sitting together.\r\nLily was above in her own room, either writing to her lover, or\r\nreading his letter, or thinking of him, or working for him. In some\r\nway she was employed on his behalf, and with this object she was\r\nalone. It was now the middle of October, and the fire was lit in\r\nMrs. Dale\'s drawing-room. The window which opened upon the lawn was\r\nclosed, the heavy curtains had been put back in their places, and\r\nit had been acknowledged as an unwelcome fact that the last of the\r\nsummer was over. This was always a sorrow to Mrs. Dale; but it is one\r\nof those sorrows which hardly admit of open expression.\r\n\r\n"Bell," she said, looking up suddenly; "there\'s your uncle at the\r\nwindow. Let him in." For now, since the putting up of the curtains,\r\nthe window had been bolted as well as closed. So Bell got up, and\r\nopened a passage for the squire\'s entrance. It was not often that he\r\ncame down in this way, and when he did do so it was generally for\r\nsome purpose which had been expressed before.\r\n\r\n"What! fires already?" said he. "I never have fires at the other\r\nhouse in the morning till the first of November. I like to see a\r\nspark in the grate after dinner."\r\n\r\n"I like a fire when I\'m cold," said Mrs. Dale. But this was a subject\r\non which the squire and his sister-in-law had differed before, and as\r\nMr. Dale had some business in hand, he did not now choose to waste\r\nhis energy in supporting his own views on the question of fires.\r\n\r\n"Bell, my dear," said he, "I want to speak to your mother for a\r\nminute or two on a matter of business. You wouldn\'t mind leaving us\r\nfor a little while, would you?" Whereupon Bell collected up her work\r\nand went upstairs to her sister. "Uncle Christopher is below with\r\nmamma," said she, "talking about business. I suppose it is something\r\nto do with your marriage." But Bell was wrong. The squire\'s visit had\r\nno reference to Lily\'s marriage.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale did not move or speak a word when Bell was gone, though it\r\nwas evident that the squire paused in order that she might ask some\r\nquestion of him. "Mary," said he, at last, "I\'ll tell you what it\r\nis that I have come to say to you." Whereupon she put the piece of\r\nneedlework which was in her hands down upon the work-basket before\r\nher, and settled herself to listen to him.\r\n\r\n"I wish to speak to you about Bell."\r\n\r\n"About Bell?" said Mrs. Dale, as though much surprised that he should\r\nhave anything to say to her respecting her eldest daughter.\r\n\r\n"Yes, about Bell. Here\'s Lily going to be married, and it will be\r\nwell that Bell should be married too."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that at all," said Mrs. Dale. "I am by no means in a\r\nhurry to be rid of her."\r\n\r\n"No, I dare say not. But, of course, you only regard her welfare,\r\nand I can truly say that I do the same. There would be no necessity\r\nfor hurry as to a marriage for her under ordinary circumstances,\r\nbut there may be circumstances to make such a thing desirable, and\r\nI think that there are." It was evident from the squire\'s tone and\r\nmanner that he was very much in earnest; but it was also evident that\r\nhe found some difficulty in opening out the budget with which he had\r\nprepared himself. He hesitated a little in his voice, and seemed to\r\nbe almost nervous. Mrs. Dale, with some little spice of ill-nature,\r\naltogether abstained from assisting him. She was jealous of\r\ninterference from him about her girls, and though she was of course\r\nbound to listen to him, she did so with a prejudice against and\r\nalmost with a resolve to oppose anything that he might say. When he\r\nhad finished his little speech about circumstances, the squire paused\r\nagain; but Mrs. Dale still sat silent, with her eyes fixed upon his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"I love your children very dearly," said he, "though I believe you\r\nhardly give me credit for doing so."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you do," said Mrs. Dale, "and they are both well aware of\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"And I am very anxious that they should be comfortably established in\r\nlife. I have no children of my own, and those of my two brothers are\r\neverything to me."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale had always considered it as a matter of course that Bernard\r\nshould be the squire\'s heir, and had never felt that her daughters\r\nhad any claim on that score. It was a well-understood thing in the\r\nfamily that the senior male Dale should have all the Dale property\r\nand all the Dale money. She fully recognized even the propriety of\r\nsuch an arrangement. But it seemed to her that the squire was almost\r\nguilty of hypocrisy in naming his nephew and his two nieces together,\r\nas though they were the joint heirs of his love. Bernard was his\r\nadopted son, and no one had begrudged to the uncle the right of\r\nmaking such adoption. Bernard was everything to him, and as being his\r\nheir was bound to obey him in many things. But her daughters were no\r\nmore to him than any nieces might be to any uncle. He had nothing\r\nto do with their disposal in marriage; and the mother\'s spirit\r\nwas already up in arms and prepared to do battle for her own\r\nindependence, and for that of her children. "If Bernard would\r\nmarry well," said she, "I have no doubt it would be a comfort to\r\nyou,"--meaning to imply thereby that the squire had no right to\r\ntrouble himself about any other marriage.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it," said the squire. "It would be a great comfort to\r\nme. And if he and Bell could make up their minds together, it would,\r\nI should think, be a great comfort to you also."\r\n\r\n"Bernard and Bell!" exclaimed Mrs. Dale. No idea of such a union\r\nhad ever yet come upon her, and now in her surprise she sat silent.\r\nShe had always liked Bernard Dale, having felt for him more family\r\naffection than for any other of the Dale family beyond her own\r\nhearth. He had been very intimate in her house, having made himself\r\nalmost as a brother to her girls. But she had never thought of him as\r\na husband for either of them.\r\n\r\n"Then Bell has not spoken to you about it," said the squire.\r\n\r\n"Never a word."\r\n\r\n"And you had never thought about it?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not."\r\n\r\n"I have thought about it a great deal. For some years I have always\r\nbeen thinking of it. I have set my heart upon it, and shall be very\r\nunhappy if it cannot be brought about. They are both very dear to\r\nme,--dearer than anybody else. If I could see them man and wife, I\r\nshould not much care then how soon I left the old place to them."\r\n\r\nThere was a purer touch of feeling in this than the squire had ever\r\nbefore shown in his sister-in-law\'s presence, and more heartiness\r\nthan she had given him the credit of possessing. And she could not\r\nbut acknowledge to herself that her own child was included in this\r\nunexpected warmth of love, and that she was bound at any rate to\r\nentertain some gratitude for such kindness.\r\n\r\n"It is good of you to think of her," said the mother; "very good."\r\n\r\n"I think a great deal about her," said the squire. "But that does not\r\nmuch matter now. The fact is, that she has declined Bernard\'s offer."\r\n\r\n"Has Bernard offered to her?"\r\n\r\n"So he tells me; and she has refused him. It may perhaps be natural\r\nthat she should do so, never having taught herself to look at him in\r\nthe light of a lover. I don\'t blame her at all. I am not angry with\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"Angry with her! No. You can hardly be angry with her for not being\r\nin love with her cousin."\r\n\r\n"I say that I am not angry with her. But I think she might undertake\r\nto consider the question. You would like such a match, would you\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale did not at first make any answer, but began to revolve the\r\nthing in her mind, and to look at it in various points of view. There\r\nwas a great deal in such an arrangement which at the first sight\r\nrecommended it to her very strongly. All the local circumstances\r\nwere in its favour. As regarded herself it would promise to her all\r\nthat she had ever desired. It would give her a prospect of seeing\r\nvery much of Lily; for if Bell were settled at the old family house,\r\nCrosbie would naturally be much with his friend. She liked Bernard\r\nalso; and for a moment or two fancied, as she turned it all over\r\nin her mind, that, even yet, if such a marriage were to take place,\r\nthere might grow up something like true regard between her and the\r\nold squire. How happy would be her old age in that Small House, if\r\nBell with her children were living so close to her!\r\n\r\n"Well?" said the squire, who was looking very intently into her face.\r\n\r\n"I was thinking," said Mrs. Dale. "Do you say that she has already\r\nrefused him?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid she has; but then you know--"\r\n\r\n"It must of course be left for her to judge."\r\n\r\n"If you mean that she cannot be made to marry her cousin, of course\r\nwe all know she can\'t."\r\n\r\n"I mean rather more than that."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, then?"\r\n\r\n"That the matter must be left altogether to her own decision; that\r\nno persuasion must be used by you or me. If he can persuade her,\r\nindeed--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, exactly. He must persuade her. I quite agree with you that\r\nhe should have liberty to plead his own cause. But look you here,\r\nMary;--she has always been a very good child to you--"\r\n\r\n"Indeed she has."\r\n\r\n"And a word from you would go a long way with her,--as it ought. If\r\nshe knows that you would like her to marry her cousin, it will make\r\nher think it her duty--"\r\n\r\n"Ah! but that is just what I cannot try to make her think."\r\n\r\n"Will you let me speak, Mary? You take me up and scold me before the\r\nwords are half out of my mouth. Of course I know that in these days\r\na young lady is not to be compelled into marrying anybody;--not but\r\nthat, as far as I can see, they did better than they do now when they\r\nhad not quite so much of their own way."\r\n\r\n"I never would take upon myself to ask a child to marry any man."\r\n\r\n"But you may explain to her that it is her duty to give such a\r\nproposal much thought before it is absolutely refused. A girl either\r\nis in love or she is not. If she is, she is ready to jump down a\r\nman\'s throat; and that was the case with Lily."\r\n\r\n"She never thought of the man till he had proposed to her fully."\r\n\r\n"Well, never mind now. But if a girl is not in love, she thinks she\r\nis bound to swear and declare that she never will be so."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think Bell ever declared anything of the kind."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she did. She told Bernard that she didn\'t love him and couldn\'t\r\nlove him,--and, in fact, that she wouldn\'t think anything more about\r\nit. Now, Mary, that\'s what I call being headstrong and positive. I\r\ndon\'t want to drive her, and I don\'t want you to drive her. But here\r\nis an arrangement which for her will be a very good one; you must\r\nadmit that. We all know that she is on excellent terms with Bernard.\r\nIt isn\'t as though they had been falling out and hating each other\r\nall their lives. She told him that she was very fond of him, and\r\ntalked nonsense about being his sister, and all that."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that it was nonsense at all."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was nonsense,--on such an occasion. If a man asks a girl to\r\nmarry him, he doesn\'t want her to talk to him about being his sister.\r\nI think it is nonsense. If she would only consider about it properly\r\nshe would soon learn to love him."\r\n\r\n"That lesson, if it be learned at all, must be learned without any\r\ntutor."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t do anything to help me then?"\r\n\r\n"I will, at any rate, do nothing to mar you. And, to tell the truth,\r\nI must think over the matter fully before I can decide what I had\r\nbetter say to Bell about it. From her not speaking to me--"\r\n\r\n"I think she ought to have told you."\r\n\r\n"No, Mr. Dale. Had she accepted him, of course she would have told\r\nme. Had she thought of doing so she might probably have consulted me.\r\nBut if she made up her mind that she must reject him--"\r\n\r\n"She oughtn\'t to have made up her mind."\r\n"But if she did, it seems natural to me that she should speak of it\r\nto no one. She might probably think that Bernard would be as well\r\npleased that it should not be known."\r\n\r\n"Psha,--known!--of course it will be known. As you want time to\r\nconsider of it, I will say nothing more now. If she were my daughter,\r\nI should have no hesitation in telling her what I thought best for\r\nher welfare."\r\n\r\n"I have none; though I may have some in making up my mind as to what\r\nis best for her welfare. But, Mr. Dale, you may be sure of this; I\r\nwill speak to her very earnestly of your kindness and love for her.\r\nAnd I wish you would believe that I feel your regard for her very\r\nstrongly."\r\n\r\nIn answer to this he merely shook his head, and hummed and hawed.\r\n"You would be glad to see them married, as regards yourself?" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n"Certainly I would," said Mrs. Dale. "I have always liked Bernard,\r\nand I believe my girl would be safe with him. But then, you see, it\'s\r\na question on which my own likings or dislikings should not have any\r\nbearing."\r\n\r\nAnd so they parted, the squire making his way back again through\r\nthe drawing-room window. He was not above half pleased with his\r\ninterview; but then he was a man for whom half-pleasure almost\r\nsufficed. He rarely indulged any expectation that people would make\r\nthemselves agreeable to him. Mrs. Dale, since she had come to the\r\nSmall House, had never been a source of satisfaction to him, but he\r\ndid not on that account regret that he had brought her there. He\r\nwas a constant man; urgent in carrying out his own plans, but not\r\nsanguine in doing so, and by no means apt to expect that all things\r\nwould go smooth with him. He had made up his mind that his nephew and\r\nhis niece should be married, and should he ultimately fail in this,\r\nsuch failure would probably embitter his future life;--but it was\r\nnot in the nature of the man to be angry in the meantime, or to fume\r\nand scold because he met with opposition. He had told Mrs. Dale that\r\nhe loved Bell dearly. So he did, though he seldom spoke to her with\r\nmuch show of special regard, and never was soft and tender with her.\r\nBut, on the other hand, he did not now love her the less because she\r\nopposed his wishes. He was a constant, undemonstrative man, given\r\nrather to brooding than to thinking; harder in his words than in his\r\nthoughts, with more of heart than others believed, or than he himself\r\nknew; but, above all, he was a man who having once desired a thing\r\nwould desire it always.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale, when she was left alone, began to turn over the question\r\nin her mind in a much fuller manner than the squire\'s presence had\r\nas yet made possible for her. Would not such a marriage as this be\r\nfor them all the happiest domestic arrangement which circumstances\r\ncould afford? Her daughter would have no fortune, but here would\r\nbe prepared for her all the comforts which fortune can give. She\r\nwould be received into her uncle\'s house, not as some penniless,\r\nportionless bride whom Bernard might have married and brought home,\r\nbut as the wife whom of all others Bernard\'s friends had thought\r\ndesirable for him. And then, as regarded Mrs. Dale herself, there\r\nwould be nothing in such a marriage which would not be delightful\r\nto her. It would give a realization to all her dreams of future\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nBut, as she said to herself over and over again, all that must go for\r\nnothing. It must be for Bell, and for her only, to answer Bernard\'s\r\nquestion. In her mind there was something sacred in that idea of\r\nlove. She would regard her daughter almost as a castaway if she were\r\nto marry any man without absolutely loving him,--loving him as Lily\r\nloved her lover, with all her heart and all her strength.\r\n\r\nWith such a conviction as this strong upon her, she felt that she\r\ncould not say much to Bell that would be of any service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nDR. CROFTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there was anything in the world as to which Isabella Dale was\r\nquite certain, it was this--that she was not in love with Dr. Crofts.\r\nAs to being in love with her cousin Bernard, she had never had\r\noccasion to ask herself any question on that head. She liked him very\r\nwell, but she had never thought of marrying him; and now, when he\r\nmade his proposal, she could not bring herself to think of it. But\r\nas regards Dr. Crofts, she had thought of it, and had made up her\r\nmind;--in the manner above described.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that she could not have been justified in discussing\r\nthe matter even within her own bosom, unless authorized to do so\r\nby Dr. Crofts himself. Let it then be considered that Dr. Crofts\r\nhad given her some such authority. This may be done in more ways\r\nthan one; and Miss Dale could not have found herself asking herself\r\nquestions about him, unless there had been fitting occasion for her\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\nThe profession of a medical man in a small provincial town is not\r\noften one which gives to its owner in early life a large income.\r\nPerhaps in no career has a man to work harder for what he earns, or\r\nto do more work without earning anything. It has sometimes seemed\r\nto me as though the young doctors and the old doctors had agreed to\r\ndivide between them the different results of their profession,--the\r\nyoung doctors doing all the work and the old doctors taking all the\r\nmoney. If this be so it may account for that appearance of premature\r\ngravity which is borne by so many of the medical profession. Under\r\nsuch an arrangement a man may be excused for a desire to put away\r\nchildish things very early in life.\r\n\r\nDr. Crofts had now been practising in Guestwick nearly seven years,\r\nhaving settled himself in that town when he was twenty-three years\r\nold, and being at this period about thirty. During those seven\r\nyears his skill and industry had been so fully admitted that he had\r\nsucceeded in obtaining the medical care of all the paupers in the\r\nunion, for which work he was paid at the rate of one hundred pounds\r\na year. He was also assistant-surgeon at a small hospital which was\r\nmaintained in that town, and held two or three other similar public\r\npositions, all of which attested his respectability and general\r\nproficiency. They, moreover, thoroughly saved him from any of the\r\ndangers of idleness; but, unfortunately, they did not enable him\r\nto regard himself as a successful professional man. Whereas old\r\nDr. Gruffen, of whom but few people spoke well, had made a fortune\r\nin Guestwick, and even still drew from the ailments of the town a\r\nconsiderable and hardly yet decreasing income. Now this was hard\r\nupon Dr. Crofts--unless there was existing some such well-understood\r\narrangement as that above named.\r\n\r\nHe had been known to the family of the Dales long previous to his\r\nsettlement at Guestwick, and had been very intimate with them from\r\nthat time to the present day. Of all the men, young or old, whom Mrs.\r\nDale counted among her intimate friends, he was the one whom she most\r\ntrusted and admired. And he was a man to be trusted by those who knew\r\nhim well. He was not bright and always ready, as was Crosbie, nor had\r\nhe all the practical worldly good sense of Bernard Dale. In mental\r\npower I doubt whether he was superior to John Eames;--to John Eames,\r\nsuch as he might become when the period of his hobbledehoyhood should\r\nhave altogether passed away. But Crofts, compared with the other\r\nthree, as they all were at present, was a man more to be trusted than\r\nany of them. And there was, moreover, about him an occasional dash\r\nof humour, without which Mrs. Dale would hardly have regarded him\r\nwith that thorough liking which she had for him. But it was a quiet\r\nhumour, apt to show itself when he had but one friend with him,\r\nrather than in general society. Crosbie, on the other hand, would\r\nbe much more bright among a dozen, than he could with a single\r\ncompanion. Bernard Dale was never bright; and as for Johnny Eames--;\r\nbut in this matter of brightness, Johnny Eames had not yet shown to\r\nthe world what his character might be.\r\n\r\nIt was now two years since Crofts had been called upon for medical\r\nadvice on behalf of his friend Mrs. Dale. She had then been ill for\r\na long period--some two or three months, and Dr. Crofts had been\r\nfrequent in his visits at Allington. At that time he became very\r\nintimate with Mrs. Dale\'s daughters, and especially so with the\r\neldest. Young unmarried doctors ought perhaps to be excluded from\r\nhouses in which there are young ladies. I know, at any rate, that\r\nmany sage matrons hold very strongly to that opinion, thinking, no\r\ndoubt, that doctors ought to get themselves married before they\r\nventure to begin working for a living. Mrs. Dale, perhaps, regarded\r\nher own girls as still merely children, for Bell, the elder, was then\r\nhardly eighteen; or perhaps she held imprudent and heterodox opinions\r\non this subject; or it may be that she selfishly preferred Dr.\r\nCrofts, with all the danger to her children, to Dr. Gruffen, with\r\nall the danger to herself. But the result was that the young doctor\r\none day informed himself, as he was riding back to Guestwick, that\r\nmuch of his happiness in this world would depend on his being able\r\nto marry Mrs. Dale\'s eldest daughter. At that time his total income\r\namounted to little more than two hundred a year, and he had resolved\r\nwithin his own mind that Dr. Gruffen was esteemed as much the better\r\ndoctor by the general public opinion of Guestwick, and that Dr.\r\nGruffen\'s sandy-haired assistant would even have a better chance of\r\nsuccess in the town than himself, should it ever come to pass that\r\nthe doctor was esteemed too old for personal practice. Crofts had no\r\nfortune of his own, and he was aware that Miss Dale had none. Then,\r\nunder those circumstances, what was he to do?\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that we should inquire at any great length into\r\nthose love passages of the doctor\'s life which took place three years\r\nbefore the commencement of this narrative. He made no declaration to\r\nBell; but Bell, young as she was, understood well that he would fain\r\nhave done so, had not his courage failed him, or rather had not his\r\nprudence prevented him. To Mrs. Dale he did speak, not openly avowing\r\nhis love even to her, but hinting at it, and then talking to her of\r\nhis unsatisfied hopes and professional disappointments. "It is not\r\nthat I complain of being poor as I am," said he; "or at any rate, not\r\nso poor that my poverty must be any source of discomfort to me; but I\r\ncould hardly marry with such an income as I have at present."\r\n\r\n"But it will increase, will it not?" said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"It may some day, when I am becoming an old man," he said. "But of\r\nwhat use will it be to me then?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale could not tell him that, as far as her voice in the matter\r\nwent, he was welcome to woo her daughter and marry her, poor as\r\nhe was, and doubly poor as they would both be together on such a\r\npittance. He had not even mentioned Bell\'s name, and had he done\r\nso she could only have bade him wait and hope. After that he said\r\nnothing further to her upon the subject. To Bell he spoke no word\r\nof overt love; but on an autumn day, when Mrs. Dale was already\r\nconvalescent, and the repetition of his professional visits had\r\nbecome unnecessary, he got her to walk with him through the\r\nhalf-hidden shrubbery paths, and then told her things which he should\r\nnever have told her, if he really wished to bind her heart to his.\r\nHe repeated that story of his income, and explained to her that\r\nhis poverty was only grievous to him in that it prevented him from\r\nthinking of marriage. "I suppose it must," said Bell. "I should think\r\nit wrong to ask any lady to share such an income as mine," said he.\r\nWhereupon Bell had suggested to him that some ladies had incomes of\r\ntheir own, and that he might in that way get over the difficulty. "I\r\nshould be afraid of myself in marrying a girl with money," said he;\r\n"besides, that is altogether out of the question now." Of course\r\nBell did not ask him why it was out of the question, and for a time\r\nthey went on walking in silence. "It is a hard thing to do," he then\r\nsaid,--not looking at her, but looking at the gravel on which he\r\nstood. "It is a hard thing to do, but I will determine to think of\r\nit no further. I believe a man may be as happy single as he may\r\nmarried,--almost." "Perhaps more so," said Bell. Then the doctor left\r\nher, and Bell, as I have said before, made up her mind with great\r\nfirmness that she was not in love with him. I may certainly say that\r\nthere was nothing in the world as to which she was so certain as she\r\nwas of this.\r\n\r\nAnd now, in these days, Dr. Crofts did not come over to Allington\r\nvery often. Had any of the family in the Small House been ill, he\r\nwould have been there of course. The squire himself employed the\r\napothecary in the village, or if higher aid was needed, would send\r\nfor Dr. Gruffen. On the occasion of Mrs. Dale\'s party, Crofts was\r\nthere, having been specially invited; but Mrs. Dale\'s special\r\ninvitations to her friends were very few, and the doctor was well\r\naware that he must himself make occasion for going there if he\r\ndesired to see the inmates of the house. But he very rarely made such\r\noccasion, perhaps feeling that he was more in his element at the\r\nworkhouse and the hospital.\r\n\r\nJust at this time, however, he made one very great and unexpected\r\nstep towards success in his profession. He was greatly surprised one\r\nmorning by being summoned to the Manor House to attend upon Lord\r\nDe Guest. The family at the Manor had employed Dr. Gruffen for the\r\nlast thirty years, and Crofts, when he received the earl\'s message,\r\ncould hardly believe the words. "The earl ain\'t very bad," said the\r\nservant, "but he would be glad to see you if possible a little before\r\ndinner."\r\n\r\n"You\'re sure he wants to see me?" said Crofts.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I\'m sure enough of that, sir."\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t Dr. Gruffen?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir; it wasn\'t Dr. Gruffen. I believe his lordship\'s had about\r\nenough of Dr. Gruffen. The doctor took to chaffing his lordship one\r\nday."\r\n\r\n"Chaffed his lordship;--his hands and feet, and that sort of thing?"\r\nsuggested the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Hands and feet!" said the man. "Lord bless you, sir, he poked his\r\nfun at him, just as though he was nobody. I didn\'t hear, but Mrs.\r\nConnor says that my lord\'s back was up terribly high." And so Dr.\r\nCrofts got on his horse and rode up to Guestwick Manor.\r\n\r\nThe earl was alone, Lady Julia having already gone to Courcy Castle.\r\n"How d\'ye do, how d\'ye do?" said the earl. "I\'m not very ill, but\r\nI want to get a little advice from you. It\'s quite a trifle, but\r\nI thought it well to see somebody." Whereupon Dr. Crofts of course\r\ndeclared that he was happy to wait upon his lordship.\r\n\r\n"I know all about you, you know," said the earl. "Your grandmother\r\nStoddard was a very old friend of my aunt\'s. You don\'t remember Lady\r\nJemima?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Crofts. "I never had that honour."\r\n\r\n"An excellent old woman, and knew your grandmother Stoddard well. You\r\nsee, Gruffen has been attending us for I don\'t know how many years;\r\nbut upon my word--" and then the earl stopped himself.\r\n\r\n"It\'s an ill wind that blows nobody any good," said Crofts, with a\r\nslight laugh.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it \'ll blow me some good, for Gruffen never did me any. The\r\nfact is this; I\'m very well, you know;--as strong as a horse."\r\n\r\n"You look pretty well."\r\n\r\n"No man could be better,--not of my age. I\'m sixty, you know."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t look as though you were ailing."\r\n\r\n"I\'m always out in the open air, and that, I take it, is the best\r\nthing for a man."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing like plenty of exercise, certainly."\r\n\r\n"And I\'m always taking exercise," said the earl. "There isn\'t a man\r\nabout the place works much harder than I do. And, let me tell you,\r\nsir, when you undertake to keep six or seven hundred acres of land in\r\nyour own hand, you must look after it, unless you mean to lose money\r\nby it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve always heard that your lordship is a good farmer."\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; wherever the grass may grow about my place, it doesn\'t\r\ngrow under my feet. You won\'t often find me in bed at six o\'clock,\r\nI can tell you."\r\n\r\nAfter this Dr. Crofts ventured to ask his lordship as to what special\r\nphysical deficiency his own aid was invoked at the present time.\r\n\r\n"Ah, I was just coming to that," said the earl. "They tell me it\'s a\r\nvery dangerous practice to go to sleep after dinner."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not very uncommon at any rate," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"I suppose not; but Lady Julia is always at me about it. And, to\r\ntell the truth, I think I sleep almost too sound when I get to my\r\narm-chair in the drawing-room. Sometimes my sister really can\'t wake\r\nme;--so, at least, she says."\r\n\r\n"And how\'s your appetite at dinner?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m quite right there. I never eat any luncheon, you know, and\r\nenjoy my dinner thoroughly. Then I drink three or four glasses of\r\nport wine--"\r\n\r\n"And feel sleepy afterwards?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it," said the earl.\r\n\r\nIt is not perhaps necessary that we should inquire what was the exact\r\nnature of the doctor\'s advice; but it was, at any rate, given in such\r\na way that the earl said he would be glad to see him again.\r\n\r\n"And look here, Doctor Crofts, I\'m all alone just at present. Suppose\r\nyou come over and dine with me to-morrow; then, if I should go to\r\nsleep, you know, you\'ll be able to let me know whether Lady Julia\r\ndoesn\'t exaggerate. Just between ourselves, I don\'t quite believe all\r\nshe says about my--my snoring, you know."\r\n\r\nWhether it was that the earl restrained his appetite when at dinner\r\nunder the doctor\'s eyes, or whether the mid-day mutton chop which had\r\nbeen ordered for him had the desired effect, or whether the doctor\'s\r\nconversation was more lively than that of the Lady Julia, we will not\r\nsay; but the earl, on the evening in question, was triumphant. As he\r\nsat in his easy-chair after dinner he hardly winked above once or\r\ntwice; and when he had taken the large bowl of tea, which he usually\r\nswallowed in a semi-somnolent condition, he was quite lively.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes," he said, jumping up and rubbing his eyes; "I think I do\r\nfeel lighter. I enjoy a snooze after dinner; I do indeed; I like it;\r\nbut then, when one comes to go to bed, one does it in such a sneaking\r\nsort of way, as though one were in disgrace! And my sister, she\r\nthinks it a crime--literally a sin, to go to sleep in a chair. Nobody\r\never caught her napping! By-the-by, Dr. Crofts, did you know that Mr.\r\nCrosbie whom Bernard Dale brought down to Allington? Lady Julia and\r\nhe are staying at the same house now."\r\n\r\n"I met him once at Mrs. Dale\'s."\r\n\r\n"Going to marry one of the girls, isn\'t he?"\r\n\r\nWhereupon Dr. Crofts explained that Mr. Crosbie was engaged to Lilian\r\nDale.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; a nice girl, I\'m told. You know all those Dales are\r\nconnections of ours. My sister Fanny married their uncle Orlando. My\r\nbrother-in-law doesn\'t like travelling, and so I don\'t see very much\r\nof him; but of course I\'m interested about the family."\r\n\r\n"They\'re very old friends of mine," said Crofts.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I daresay. There are two girls, are there not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, two."\r\n\r\n"And Miss Lily is the youngest. There\'s nothing about the elder one\r\ngetting married, is there?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve not heard anything of it."\r\n\r\n"A very pretty girl she is, too. I remember seeing her at her uncle\'s\r\nlast year. I shouldn\'t wonder if she were to marry her cousin\r\nBernard. He is to have the property, you know; and he\'s my nephew."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not quite sure that it\'s a good thing for cousins to marry,"\r\nsaid Crofts.\r\n\r\n"They do, you know, very often; and it suits some family\r\narrangements. I suppose Dale must provide for them, and that would\r\ntake one off his hands without any trouble."\r\n\r\nDr. Crofts didn\'t exactly see the matter in this light, but he was\r\nnot anxious to argue it very closely with the earl. "The younger\r\none," he said, "has provided for herself."\r\n\r\n"What; by getting a husband? But I suppose Dale must give her\r\nsomething. They\'re not married yet, you know, and, from what I hear,\r\nthat fellow may prove a slippery customer. He\'ll not marry her unless\r\nold Dale gives her something. You\'ll see if he does. I\'m told that he\r\nhas got another string to his bow at Courcy Castle."\r\n\r\nSoon after this, Crofts took his horse and rode home, having promised\r\nthe earl that he would dine with him again before long.\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be a great convenience to me if you\'d come about that time,"\r\nsaid the earl, "and as you\'re a bachelor perhaps you won\'t mind it.\r\nYou\'ll come on Thursday at seven, will you? Take care of yourself.\r\nIt\'s as dark as pitch. John, go and open the first gates for Dr.\r\nCrofts." And then the earl took himself off to bed.\r\n\r\nCrofts, as he rode home, could not keep his mind from thinking of\r\nthe two girls at Allington. "He\'ll not marry her unless old Dale\r\ngives her something." Had it come to that with the world, that a man\r\nmust be bribed into keeping his engagement with a lady? Was there\r\nno romance left among mankind,--no feeling of chivalry? "He\'s got\r\nanother string to his bow at Courcy Castle," said the earl; and his\r\nlordship seemed to be in no degree shocked as he said it. It was in\r\nthis tone that men spoke of women now-a-days, and yet he himself had\r\nfelt such awe of the girl he loved, and such a fear lest he might\r\ninjure her in her worldly position, that he had not dared to tell her\r\nthat he loved her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nJOHN EAMES ENCOUNTERS TWO ADVENTURES, AND DISPLAYS GREAT COURAGE IN\r\nBOTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nLily thought that her lover\'s letter was all that it should be.\r\nShe was not quite aware what might be the course of post between\r\nCourcy and Allington, and had not, therefore, felt very grievously\r\ndisappointed when the letter did not come on the very first day.\r\nShe had, however, in the course of the morning, walked down to\r\nthe post-office, in order that she might be sure that it was not\r\nremaining there.\r\n\r\n"Why, miss, they be all delivered; you know that," said Mrs. Crump,\r\nthe post-mistress.\r\n\r\n"But one might be left behind, I thought."\r\n\r\n"John Postman went up to the house this very day, with a newspaper\r\nfor your mamma. I can\'t make letters for people if folks don\'t write\r\nthem.".\r\n\r\n"But they are left behind sometimes, Mrs. Crump. He wouldn\'t come up\r\nwith one letter if he\'d got nothing else for anybody in the street."\r\n\r\n"Indeed but he would then. I wouldn\'t let him leave a letter here\r\nno how, nor yet a paper. It\'s no good you\'re coming down here for\r\nletters, Miss Lily. If he don\'t write to you, I can\'t make him do\r\nit." And so poor Lily went home discomforted.\r\n\r\nBut the letter came on the next morning, and all was right. According\r\nto her judgment it lacked nothing, either in fulness or in affection.\r\nWhen he told her how he had planned his early departure in order that\r\nhe might avoid the pain of parting with her on the last moment, she\r\nsmiled and pressed the paper, and rejoiced inwardly that she had\r\ngot the better of him as to that manoeuvre. And then she kissed the\r\nwords which told her that he had been glad to have her with him\r\nat the last moment. When he declared that he had been happier at\r\nAllington than he was at Courcy, she believed him thoroughly, and\r\nrejoiced that it should be so. And when he accused himself of being\r\nworldly, she excused him, persuading herself that he was nearly\r\nperfect in this respect as in others. Of course a man living in\r\nLondon, and having to earn his bread out in the world, must be more\r\nworldly than a country girl; but the fact of his being able to love\r\nsuch a girl, to choose such a one for his wife,--was not that alone\r\nsufficient proof that the world had not enslaved him? "My heart is on\r\nthe Allington lawns," he said; and then, as she read the words, she\r\nkissed the paper again.\r\n\r\nIn her eyes, and to her ears, and to her heart, the letter was a\r\nbeautiful letter. I believe there is no bliss greater than that which\r\na thorough love-letter gives to a girl who knows that in receiving it\r\nshe commits no fault,--who can open it before her father and mother\r\nwith nothing more than the slight blush which the consciousness of\r\nher position gives her. And of all love-letters the first must be the\r\nsweetest! What a value there is in every word! How each expression is\r\nscanned and turned to the best account! With what importance are all\r\nthose little phrases invested, which too soon become mere phrases,\r\nused as a matter of course. Crosbie had finished his letter by\r\nbidding God bless her; "And you too," said Lily, pressing the letter\r\nto her bosom.\r\n\r\n"Does he say anything particular?" asked Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma; it\'s all very particular."\r\n\r\n"But there\'s nothing for the public ear."\r\n\r\n"He sends his love to you and Bell."\r\n\r\n"We are very much obliged to him."\r\n\r\n"So you ought to be. And he says that he went to church going through\r\nBarchester, and that the clergyman was the grandfather of that Lady\r\nDumbello. When he got to Courcy Castle Lady Dumbello was there."\r\n\r\n"What a singular coincidence!" said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t tell you a word more about his letter," said Lily. So she\r\nfolded it up, and put it in her pocket. But as soon as she found\r\nherself alone in her own room, she had it out again, and read it over\r\nsome half-a-dozen times.\r\n\r\nThat was the occupation of her morning;--that, and the manufacture\r\nof some very intricate piece of work which was intended for the\r\nadornment of Mr. Crosbie\'s person. Her hands, however, were very full\r\nof work;--or, rather, she intended that they should be full. She\r\nwould take with her to her new home, when she was married, all manner\r\nof household gear, the produce of her own industry and economy. She\r\nhad declared that she wanted to do something for her future husband,\r\nand she would begin that something at once. And in this matter she\r\ndid not belie her promises to herself, or allow her good intentions\r\nto evaporate unaccomplished. She soon surrounded herself with harder\r\ntasks than those embroidered slippers with which she indulged herself\r\nimmediately after his departure. And Mrs. Dale and Bell,--though in\r\ntheir gentle way they laughed at her,--nevertheless they worked with\r\nher, sitting sternly to their long tasks, in order that Crosbie\'s\r\nhouse might not be empty when their darling should go to take her\r\nplace there as his wife.\r\n\r\nBut it was absolutely necessary that the letter should be answered.\r\nIt would in her eyes have been a great sin to have let that day\'s\r\npost go without carrying a letter from her to Courcy Castle,--a sin\r\nof which she felt no temptation to be guilty. It was an exquisite\r\npleasure to her to seat herself at her little table, with her neat\r\ndesk and small appurtenances for epistle-craft, and to feel that she\r\nhad a letter to write in which she had truly much to say. Hitherto\r\nher correspondence had been uninteresting and almost weak in its\r\nnature. From her mother and sister she had hardly yet been parted;\r\nand though she had other friends, she had seldom found herself with\r\nvery much to tell them by post. What could she communicate to Mary\r\nEames at Guestwick, which should be in itself exciting as she wrote\r\nit? When she wrote to John Eames, and told "Dear John" that mamma\r\nhoped to have the pleasure of seeing him to tea at such an hour, the\r\nwork of writing was of little moment to her, though the note when\r\nwritten became one of the choicest treasures of him to whom it was\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\nBut now the matter was very different. When she saw the words\r\n"Dearest Adolphus" on the paper before her, she was startled with\r\ntheir significance. "And four months ago I had never even heard of\r\nhim," she said to herself, almost with awe. And now he was more to\r\nher, and nearer to her, than even was her sister or her mother! She\r\nrecollected how she had laughed at him behind his back, and called\r\nhim a swell on the first day of his coming to the Small House, and\r\nhow, also, she had striven, in her innocent way, to look her best\r\nwhen called upon to go out and walk with the stranger from London.\r\nHe was no longer a stranger now, but her own dearest friend.\r\n\r\nShe had put down her pen that she might think of all this--by no\r\nmeans for the first time--and then resumed it with a sudden start\r\nas though fearing that the postman might be in the village before\r\nher letter was finished. "Dearest Adolphus, I need not tell you how\r\ndelighted I was when your letter was brought to me this morning."\r\nBut I will not repeat the whole of her letter here. She had no\r\nincident to relate, none even so interesting as that of Mr. Crosbie\'s\r\nencounter with Mr. Harding at Barchester. She had met no Lady\r\nDumbello, and had no counterpart to Lady Alexandrina, of whom, as\r\na friend, she could say a word in praise. John Eames\'s name she did\r\nnot mention, knowing that John Eames was not a favourite with Mr.\r\nCrosbie; nor had she anything to say of John Eames, that had not been\r\nalready said. He had, indeed, promised to come over to Allington;\r\nbut this visit had not been made when Lily wrote her first letter to\r\nCrosbie. It was a sweet, good, honest love-letter, full of assurances\r\nof unalterable affection and unlimited confidence, indulging in a\r\nlittle quiet fun as to the grandees of Courcy Castle, and ending with\r\na promise that she would be happy and contented if she might receive\r\nhis letters constantly, and live with the hope of seeing him at\r\nChristmas.\r\n\r\n"I am in time, Mrs. Crump, am I not?" she said, as she walked into\r\nthe post-office.\r\n\r\n"Of course you be,--for the next half-hour. T\' postman--he bain\'t\r\nstirred from t\' ale\'us yet. Just put it into t\' box, wull ye?"\r\n\r\n"But you won\'t leave it there?"\r\n\r\n"Leave it there! Did you ever hear the like of that? If you\'re\r\nafeared to put it in, you can take it away; that\'s all about it,\r\nMiss Lily." And then Mrs. Crump turned away to her avocations at the\r\nwashing-tub. Mrs. Crump had a bad temper, but perhaps she had some\r\nexcuse. A separate call was made upon her time with reference to\r\nalmost every letter brought to her office, and for all this, as she\r\noften told her friends in profound disgust, she received as salary no\r\nmore than "tuppence farden a day. It don\'t find me in shoe-leather;\r\nno more it don\'t." As Mrs. Crump was never seen out of her own house,\r\nunless it was in church once a month, this latter assertion about her\r\nshoe-leather, could hardly have been true.\r\n\r\nLily had received another letter, and had answered it before Eames\r\nmade his promised visit to Allington. He, as will be remembered, had\r\nalso had a correspondence. He had answered Miss Roper\'s letter, and\r\nhad since that been living in fear of two things; in a lesser fear of\r\nsome terrible rejoinder from Amelia, and in a greater fear of a more\r\nterrible visit from his lady-love. Were she to swoop down in very\r\ntruth upon his Guestwick home, and declare herself to his mother and\r\nsister as his affianced bride, what mode of escape would then be left\r\nfor him? But this she had not yet done, nor had she even answered his\r\ncruel missive.\r\n\r\n"What an ass I am to be afraid of her!" he said to himself as he\r\nwalked along under the elms of Guestwick manor, which overspread the\r\nroad to Allington. When he first went over to Allington after his\r\nreturn home, he had mounted himself on horseback, and had gone forth\r\nbrilliant with spurs, and trusting somewhat to the glories of his\r\ndress and gloves. But he had then known nothing of Lily\'s engagement.\r\nNow he was contented to walk; and as he had taken up his slouched\r\nhat and stick in the passage of his mother\'s house, he had been very\r\nindifferent as to his appearance. He walked quickly along the road,\r\ntaking for the first three miles the shade of the Guestwick elms, and\r\nkeeping his feet on the broad greensward which skirts the outside of\r\nthe earl\'s palings. "What an ass I am to be afraid of her!" And as he\r\nswung his big stick in his hand, striking a tree here and there, and\r\nknocking the stones from his path, he began to question himself in\r\nearnest, and to be ashamed of his position in the world. "Nothing on\r\nearth shall make me marry her," he said; "not if they bring a dozen\r\nactions against me. She knows as well as I do, that I have never\r\nintended to marry her. It\'s a cheat from beginning to end. If she\r\ncomes down here, I\'ll tell her so before my mother." But as the\r\nvision of her sudden arrival came before his eyes, he acknowledged to\r\nhimself that he still held her in great fear. He had told her that he\r\nloved her. He had written as much as that. If taxed with so much, he\r\nmust confess his sin.\r\n\r\nThen, by degrees, his mind turned away from Amelia Roper to Lily\r\nDale, not giving him a prospect much more replete with enjoyment than\r\nthat other one. He had said that he would call at Allington before he\r\nreturned to town, and he was now redeeming his promise. But he did\r\nnot know why he should go there. He felt that he should sit silent\r\nand abashed in Mrs. Dale\'s drawing-room, confessing by his demeanour\r\nthat secret which it behoved him now to hide from every one. He could\r\nnot talk easily before Lily, nor could he speak to her of the only\r\nsubject which would occupy his thoughts when in her presence. If\r\nindeed, he might find her alone-- But, perhaps that might be worse\r\nfor him than any other condition.\r\n\r\nWhen he was shown into the drawing-room there was nobody there. "They\r\nwere here a minute ago, all three," said the servant girl. "If you\'ll\r\nwalk down the garden, Mr. John, you\'ll be sure to find some of \'em."\r\nSo John Eames, with a little hesitation, walked down the garden.\r\n\r\nFirst of all he went the whole way round the walks, meeting nobody.\r\nThen he crossed the lawn, returning again to the farther end; and\r\nthere, emerging from the little path which led from the Great House,\r\nhe encountered Lily alone. "Oh, John," she said, "how d\'ye do? I\'m\r\nafraid you did not find anybody in the house. Mamma and Bell are with\r\nHopkins, away in the large kitchen-garden."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve just come over," said Eames, "because I promised. I said I\'d\r\ncome before I went back to London."\r\n\r\n"And they\'ll be very glad to see you, and so am I. Shall we go after\r\nthem into the other grounds? But perhaps you walked over and are\r\ntired."\r\n\r\n"I did walk," said Eames; "not that I am very tired." But in truth\r\nhe did not wish to go after Mrs. Dale, though he was altogether at\r\na loss as to what he would say to Lily while remaining with her. He\r\nhad fancied that he would like to have some opportunity of speaking\r\nto her alone before he went away;--of making some special use of the\r\nlast interview which he should have with her before she became a\r\nmarried woman. But now the opportunity was there, and he hardly dared\r\nto avail himself of it.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll stay and dine with us," said Lily.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'ll not do that, for I especially told my mother that I would\r\nbe back."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure it was very good of you to walk so far to see us. If you\r\nreally are not tired, I think we will go to mamma, as she would be\r\nvery sorry to miss you."\r\n\r\nThis she said, remembering at the moment what had been Crosbie\'s\r\ninjunctions to her about John Eames. But John had resolved that\r\nhe would say those words which he had come to speak, and that, as\r\nLily was there with him, he would avail himself of the chance which\r\nfortune had given him.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I\'ll go into the squire\'s garden," he said.\r\n\r\n"Uncle Christopher is not there. He is about the farm somewhere."\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t mind, Lily, I think I\'ll stay here. I suppose they\'ll\r\nbe back soon. Of course I should like to see them before I go away to\r\nLondon. But, Lily, I came over now chiefly to see you. It was you who\r\nasked me to promise."\r\n\r\nHad Crosbie been right in those remarks of his? Had she been\r\nimprudent in her little endeavour to be cordially kind to her old\r\nfriend? "Shall we go into the drawing-room?" she said, feeling that\r\nshe would be in some degree safer there than out among the shrubs and\r\npaths of the garden. And I think she was right in this. A man will\r\ntalk of love out among the lilacs and roses, who would be stricken\r\ndumb by the demure propriety of the four walls of a drawing-room.\r\nJohn Eames also had some feeling of this kind, for he determined to\r\nremain out in the garden, if he could so manage it.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to go in unless you wish it," he said. "Indeed, I\'d\r\nrather stay here. So, Lily, you\'re going to be married?" And thus he\r\nrushed at once into the middle of his discourse.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said she, "I believe I am."\r\n\r\n"I have not told you yet that I congratulated you."\r\n\r\n"I have known very well that you did so in your heart. I have always\r\nbeen sure that you wished me well."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I have. And if congratulating a person is hoping that she\r\nmay always be happy, I do congratulate you. But, Lily--" And then he\r\npaused, abashed by the beauty, purity, and woman\'s grace which had\r\nforced him to love her.\r\n\r\n"I think I understand all that you would say. I do not want ordinary\r\nwords to tell me that I am to count you among my best friends."\r\n\r\n"No, Lily; you don\'t understand all that I would say. You have never\r\nknown how often and how much I have thought of you; how dearly I have\r\nloved you."\r\n\r\n"John, you must not talk of that now."\r\n\r\n"I cannot go without telling you. When I came over here, and Mrs.\r\nDale told me that you were to be married to that man--"\r\n\r\n"You must not speak of Mr. Crosbie in that way," she said, turning\r\nupon him almost fiercely.\r\n\r\n"I did not mean to say anything disrespectful of him to you. I should\r\nhate myself if I were to do so. Of course you like him better than\r\nanybody else?"\r\n\r\n"I love him better than all the world besides."\r\n\r\n"And so do I love you better than all the world besides." And as he\r\nspoke he got up from his seat and stood before her. "I know how poor\r\nI am, and unworthy of you; and only that you are engaged to him,\r\nI don\'t suppose that I should now tell you. Of course you couldn\'t\r\naccept such a one as me. But I have loved you ever since you\r\nremember; and now that you are going to be his wife, I cannot but\r\ntell you that it is so. You will go and live in London; but as to my\r\nseeing you there, it will be impossible. I could not go into that\r\nman\'s house."\r\n\r\n"Oh, John."\r\n\r\n"No, never; not if you become his wife. I have loved you as well\r\nas he does. When Mrs. Dale told me of it, I thought I should have\r\nfallen. I went away without seeing you because I was unable to speak\r\nto you. I made a fool of myself, and have been a fool all along. I am\r\nfoolish now to tell you this, but I cannot help it."\r\n\r\n"You will forget it all when you meet some girl that you can really\r\nlove."\r\n\r\n"And have I not really loved you? Well, never mind. I have said what\r\nI came to say, and I will now go. If it ever happens that we are down\r\nin the country together, perhaps I may see you again; but never in\r\nLondon. Good-by, Lily." And he put out his hand to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: "And have I not really loved you?"]\r\n\r\n\r\n"And won\'t you stay for mamma?" she said.\r\n\r\n"No. Give her my love, and to Bell. They understand all about it.\r\nThey will know why I have gone. If ever you should want anybody to do\r\nanything for you, remember that I will do it, whatever it is." And\r\nas he paced away from her across the lawn, the special deed in her\r\nfavour to which his mind was turned,--that one thing which he most\r\nlonged to do on her behalf,--was an act of corporal chastisement upon\r\nCrosbie. If Crosbie would but ill-treat her,--ill-treat her with\r\nsome antenuptial barbarity,--and if only he could be called in to\r\navenge her wrongs! And as he made his way back along the road towards\r\nGuestwick, he built up within his own bosom a castle in the air,\r\nfor her part in which Lily Dale would by no means have thanked him.\r\n\r\nLily when she was left alone burst into tears. She had certainly\r\nsaid very little to encourage her forlorn suitor, and had so borne\r\nherself during the interview that even Crosbie could hardly have\r\nbeen dissatisfied; but now that Eames was gone her heart became very\r\ntender towards him. She felt that she did love him also;--not at\r\nall as she loved Crosbie, but still with a love that was tender,\r\nsoft, and true. If Crosbie could have known all her thoughts at that\r\nmoment, I doubt whether he would have liked them. She burst into\r\ntears, and then hurried away into some nook where she could not be\r\nseen by her mother and Bell on their return.\r\n\r\nEames went on his way, walking very quietly, swinging his stick and\r\nkicking through the dust, with his heart full of the scene which had\r\njust passed. He was angry with himself, thinking that he had played\r\nhis part badly, accusing himself in that he had been rough to her,\r\nand selfish in the expression of his love; and he was angry with her\r\nbecause she had declared to him that she loved Crosbie better than\r\nall the world besides. He knew that of course she must do so;--that\r\nat any rate it was to be expected that such was the case. Yet, he\r\nthought, she might have refrained from saying so to him. "She chooses\r\nto scorn me now," he said to himself; "but the time may come when she\r\nwill wish that she had scorned him." That Crosbie was wicked, bad,\r\nand selfish, he believed most fully. He felt sure that the man would\r\nill-use her and make her wretched. He had some slight doubt whether\r\nhe would marry her, and from this doubt he endeavoured to draw a\r\nscrap of comfort. If Crosbie would desert her, and if to him might\r\nbe accorded the privilege of beating the man to death with his fists\r\nbecause of this desertion, then the world would not be quite blank\r\nfor him. In all this he was no doubt very cruel to Lily;--but then\r\nhad not Lily been very cruel to him?\r\n\r\nHe was still thinking of these things when he came to the first of\r\nthe Guestwick pastures. The boundary of the earl\'s property was very\r\nplainly marked, for with it commenced also the shady elms along the\r\nroadside, and the broad green margin of turf, grateful equally to\r\nthose who walked and to those who rode. Eames had got himself on to\r\nthe grass, but, in the fulness of his thoughts, was unconscious of\r\nthe change in his path, when he was startled by a voice in the next\r\nfield and the loud bellowing of a bull. Lord De Guest\'s choice cattle\r\nhe knew were there, and there was one special bull which was esteemed\r\nby his lordship as of great value, and regarded as a high favourite.\r\nThe people about the place declared that the beast was vicious, but\r\nLord De Guest had often been heard to boast that it was never vicious\r\nwith him. "The boys tease him, and the men are almost worse than the\r\nboys," said the earl; "but he\'ll never hurt any one that has not hurt\r\nhim." Guided by faith in his own teaching the earl had taught himself\r\nto look upon his bull as a large, horned, innocent lamb of the flock.\r\n\r\nAs Eames paused on the road, he fancied that he recognized the earl\'s\r\nvoice, and it was the voice of one in distress. Then the bull\'s roar\r\nsounded very plain in his ear, and almost close; upon hearing which\r\nhe rushed on to the gate, and, without much thinking what he was\r\ndoing, vaulted over it, and advanced a few steps into the field.\r\n\r\n"Halloo!" shouted the earl. "There\'s a man. Come on." And then his\r\ncontinued shoutings hardly formed themselves into intelligible words;\r\nbut Eames plainly understood that he was invoking assistance under\r\ngreat pressure and stress of circumstances. The bull was making short\r\nruns at his owner, as though determined in each run to have a toss\r\nat his lordship; and at each run the earl would retreat quickly\r\nfor a few paces, but he retreated always facing his enemy, and as\r\nthe animal got near to him, would make digs at his face with the\r\nlong spud which he carried in his hand. But in thus making good his\r\nretreat he had been unable to keep in a direct line to the gate,\r\nand there seemed to be great danger lest the bull should succeed in\r\npressing him up against the hedge. "Come on!" shouted the earl, who\r\nwas fighting his battle manfully, but was by no means anxious to\r\ncarry off all the laurels of the victory himself. "Come on, I say!"\r\nThen he stopped in his path, shouted into the bull\'s face, brandished\r\nhis spud, and threw about his arms, thinking that he might best\r\ndismay the beast by the display of these warlike gestures.\r\n\r\nJohnny Eames ran on gallantly to the peer\'s assistance, as he would\r\nhave run to that of any peasant in the land. He was one to whom I\r\nshould be perhaps wrong to attribute at this period of his life the\r\ngift of very high courage. He feared many things which no man should\r\nfear; but he did not fear personal mishap or injury to his own skin\r\nand bones. When Cradell escaped out of the house in Burton Crescent,\r\nmaking his way through the passage into the outer air, he did so\r\nbecause he feared that Lupex would beat him or kick him, or otherwise\r\nill-use him. John Eames would also have desired to escape under\r\nsimilar circumstances; but he would have so desired because he could\r\nnot endure to be looked upon in his difficulties by the people of the\r\nhouse, and because his imagination would have painted the horrors\r\nof a policeman dragging him off with a black eye and a torn coat.\r\nThere was no one to see him now, and no policeman to take offence.\r\nTherefore he rushed to the earl\'s assistance, brandishing his stick,\r\nand roaring in emulation of the bull.\r\n\r\nWhen the animal saw with what unfairness he was treated, and that\r\nthe number of his foes was doubled, while no assistance had lent\r\nitself on his side, he stood for a while, disgusted by the injustice\r\nof humanity. He stopped, and throwing his head up to the heavens,\r\nbellowed out his complaint. "Don\'t come close!" said the earl, who\r\nwas almost out of breath. "Keep a little apart. Ugh! ugh! whoop,\r\nwhoop!" And he threw up his arms manfully, jobbing about with his\r\nspud, ever and anon rubbing the perspiration from off his eyebrows\r\nwith the back of his hand.\r\n\r\nAs the bull stood pausing, meditating whether under such\r\ncircumstances flight would not be preferable to gratified passion,\r\nEames made a rush in at him, attempting to hit him on the head. The\r\nearl, seeing this, advanced a step also, and got his spud almost up\r\nto the animal\'s eye. But these indignities the beast could not stand.\r\nHe made a charge, bending his head first towards John Eames, and\r\nthen, with that weak vacillation which is as disgraceful in a bull\r\nas in a general, he changed his purpose, and turned his horns upon\r\nhis other enemy. The consequence was that his steps carried him in\r\nbetween the two, and that the earl and Eames found themselves for a\r\nwhile behind his tail.\r\n\r\n"Now for the gate," said the earl.\r\n\r\n"Slowly does it; slowly does it; don\'t run!" said Johnny, assuming in\r\nthe heat of the moment a tone of counsel which would have been very\r\nforeign to him under other circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe earl was not a whit offended. "All right," said he, taking with\r\na backward motion the direction of the gate. Then as the bull again\r\nfaced towards him, he jumped from the ground, labouring painfully\r\nwith arms and legs, and ever keeping his spud well advanced against\r\nthe foe. Eames, holding his position a little apart from his friend,\r\nstooped low and beat the ground with his stick, and as though defying\r\nthe creature. The bull felt himself defied, stood still and roared,\r\nand then made another vacillating attack.\r\n\r\n"Hold on till we reach the gate," said Eames.\r\n\r\n"Ugh! ugh! Whoop! whoop!" shouted the earl. And so gradually they\r\nmade good their ground.\r\n\r\n"Now get over," said Eames, when they had both reached the corner of\r\nthe field in which the gate stood.\r\n\r\n"And what\'ll you do?" said the earl.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go at the hedge to the right." And Johnny as he spoke dashed\r\nhis stick about, so as to monopolize, for a moment, the attention of\r\nthe brute. The earl made a spring at the gate, and got well on to the\r\nupper rung. The bull seeing that his prey was going, made a final\r\nrush upon the earl and struck the timber furiously with his head,\r\nknocking his lordship down on the other side. Lord De Guest was\r\nalready over, but not off the rail; and thus, though he fell, he\r\nfell in safety on the sward beyond the gate. He fell in safety, but\r\nutterly exhausted. Eames, as he had purposed, made a leap almost\r\nsideways at a thick hedge which divided the field from one of the\r\nGuestwick copses. There was a fairly broad ditch, and on the other\r\nside a quickset hedge, which had, however, been weakened and injured\r\nby trespassers at this corner, close to the gate. Eames was young and\r\nactive and jumped well. He jumped so well that he carried his body\r\nfull into the middle of the quickset, and then scrambled through to\r\nthe other side, not without much injury to his clothes, and some\r\ndamage also to his hands and face.\r\n\r\nThe beast, recovering from his shock against the wooden bars, looked\r\nwistfully at his last retreating enemy, as he still struggled amidst\r\nthe bushes. He looked at the ditch and at the broken hedge, but he\r\ndid not understand how weak were the impediments in his way. He had\r\nknocked his head against the stout timber, which was strong enough\r\nto oppose him, but was dismayed by the brambles which he might have\r\ntrodden under foot without an effort. How many of us are like the\r\nbull, turning away conquered by opposition which should be as nothing\r\nto us, and breaking our feet, and worse still, our hearts, against\r\nrocks of adamant. The bull at last made up his mind that he did not\r\ndare to face the hedge; so he gave one final roar, and then turning\r\nhimself round, walked placidly back amidst the herd.\r\n\r\nJohnny made his way on to the road by a stile that led out of the\r\ncopse, and was soon standing over the earl, while the blood ran down\r\nhis cheeks from the scratches. One of the legs of his trowsers had\r\nbeen caught by a stake, and was torn from the hip downward, and his\r\nhat was left in the field, the only trophy for the bull. "I hope\r\nyou\'re not hurt, my lord," he said.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no; but I\'m terribly out of breath. Why, you\'re bleeding\r\nall over. He didn\'t get at you, did he?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s only the thorns in the hedge," said Johnny, passing his hand\r\nover his face. "But I\'ve lost my hat."\r\n\r\n"There are plenty more hats," said the earl.\r\n\r\n"I think I\'ll have a try for it," said Johnny, with whom the means of\r\ngetting hats had not been so plentiful as with the earl. "He looks\r\nquiet now." And he moved towards the gate.\r\n\r\nBut Lord De Guest jumped upon his feet, and seized the young man by\r\nthe collar of his coat. "Go after your hat!" said he. "You must be\r\na fool to think of it. If you\'re afraid of catching cold, you shall\r\nhave mine."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not the least afraid of catching cold," said Johnny. "Is he\r\noften like that, my lord?" And he made a motion with his head towards\r\nthe bull.\r\n\r\n"The gentlest creature alive; he\'s like a lamb generally--just like a\r\nlamb. Perhaps he saw my red pocket-handkerchief." And Lord De Guest\r\nshowed his friend that he carried such an article. "But where should\r\nI have been if you hadn\'t come up?"\r\n\r\n"You\'d have got to the gate, my lord."\r\n\r\n"Yes; with my feet foremost, and four men carrying me. I\'m very\r\nthirsty. You don\'t happen to carry a flask, do you?"\r\n\r\n"No, my lord, I don\'t."\r\n\r\n"Then we\'ll make the best of our way home, and have a glass of wine\r\nthere." And on this occasion his lordship intended that his offer\r\nshould be accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nLORD DE GUEST AT HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: (untitled)]\r\n\r\nThe earl and John Eames, after their escape from the bull, walked up\r\nto the Manor House together. "You can write a note to your mother,\r\nand I\'ll send it by one of the boys," said the earl. This was his\r\nlordship\'s answer when Eames declined to dine at the Manor House,\r\nbecause he would be expected home.\r\n\r\n"But I\'m so badly off for clothes, my lord," pleaded Johnny. "I tore\r\nmy trowsers in the hedge."\r\n\r\n"There will be nobody there beside us two and Dr. Crofts. The doctor\r\nwill forgive you when he hears the story; and as for me, I didn\'t\r\ncare if you hadn\'t a stitch to your back. You\'ll have company back to\r\nGuestwick, so come along."\r\n\r\nEames had no further excuse to offer, and therefore did as he was\r\nbidden. He was by no means as much at home with the earl now as\r\nduring those minutes of the combat. He would rather have gone home,\r\nbeing somewhat ashamed of being seen in his present tattered and\r\nbare-headed condition by the servants of the house; and moreover, his\r\nmind would sometimes revert to the scene which had taken place in the\r\ngarden at Allington. But he found himself obliged to obey the earl,\r\nand so he walked on with him through the woods.\r\n\r\nThe earl did not say very much, being tired and somewhat thoughtful.\r\nIn what little he did say he seemed to be specially hurt by the\r\ningratitude of the bull towards himself. "I never teased him, or\r\nannoyed him in any way."\r\n\r\n"I suppose they are dangerous beasts?" said Eames.\r\n\r\n"Not a bit of it, if they\'re properly treated. It must have been my\r\nhandkerchief, I suppose. I remember that I did blow my nose."\r\n\r\nHe hardly said a word in the way of thanks to his assistant. "Where\r\nshould I have been if you had not come to me?" he had exclaimed\r\nimmediately after his deliverance; but having said that he didn\'t\r\nthink it necessary to say much more to Eames. But he made himself\r\nvery pleasant, and by the time he had reached the house his companion\r\nwas almost glad that he had been forced to dine at the Manor House.\r\n"And now we\'ll have a drink," said the earl. "I don\'t know how you\r\nfeel, but I never was so thirsty in my life."\r\n\r\nTwo servants immediately showed themselves, and evinced some surprise\r\nat Johnny\'s appearance. "Has the gentleman hurt hisself, my lord?"\r\nasked the butler, looking at the blood upon our friend\'s face.\r\n\r\n"He has hurt his trowsers the worst, I believe," said the earl. "And\r\nif he was to put on any of mine they\'d be too short and too big,\r\nwouldn\'t they? I am sorry you should be so uncomfortable, but you\r\nmustn\'t mind it for once."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind it a bit," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"And I\'m sure I don\'t," said the earl. "Mr. Eames is going to dine\r\nhere, Vickers."\r\n\r\n"Yes, my lord."\r\n\r\n"And his hat is down in the middle of the nineteen acres. Let three\r\nor four men go for it."\r\n\r\n"Three or four men, my lord!"\r\n\r\n"Yes,--three or four men. There\'s something gone wrong with that\r\nbull. And you must get a boy with a pony to take a note into\r\nGuestwick, to Mrs. Eames. Oh dear, I\'m better now," and he put down\r\nthe tumbler from which he\'d been drinking. "Write your note here, and\r\nthen we\'ll go and see my pet pheasants before dinner."\r\n\r\nVickers and the footman knew that something had happened of\r\nmuch moment, for the earl was usually very particular about his\r\ndinner-table. He expected every guest who sat there to be dressed in\r\nsuch guise as the fashion of the day demanded; and he himself, though\r\nhis morning costume was by no means brilliant, never dined, even when\r\nalone, without having put himself into a suit of black, with a white\r\ncravat, and having exchanged the old silver hunting-watch which he\r\ncarried during the day tied round his neck by a bit of old ribbon,\r\nfor a small gold watch, with a chain and seals, which in the evening\r\nalways dangled over his waistcoat. Dr. Gruffen had once been asked to\r\ndinner at Guestwick Manor. "Just a bachelor\'s chop," said the earl;\r\n"for there\'s nobody at home but myself." Whereupon Dr. Gruffen had\r\ncome in coloured trowsers,--and had never again been asked to dine\r\nat Guestwick Manor. All this Vickers knew well; and now his lordship\r\nhad brought young Eames home to dine with him with his clothes all\r\nhanging about him in a manner which Vickers declared in the servants\'\r\nhall wasn\'t more than half decent. Therefore, they all knew that\r\nsomething very particular must have happened. "It\'s some trouble\r\nabout the bull, I know," said Vickers;--"but bless you, the bull\r\ncouldn\'t have tore his things in that way!"\r\n\r\nEames wrote his note, in which he told his mother that he had had an\r\nadventure with Lord De Guest, and that his lordship had insisted on\r\nbringing him home to dinner. "I have torn my trowsers all to pieces,"\r\nhe added in a postscript, "and have lost my hat. Everything else is\r\nall right." He was not aware that the earl also sent a short note to\r\nMrs. Eames.\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR MADAM [ran the earl\'s note],--\r\n\r\n   Your son has, under Providence, probably saved my life.\r\n   I will leave the story for him to tell. He has been\r\n   good enough to accompany me home, and will return to\r\n   Guestwick after dinner with Dr. Crofts, who dines here. I\r\n   congratulate you on having a son with so much cool courage\r\n   and good feeling.\r\n\r\n   Your very faithful servant,\r\n\r\n   DE GUEST.\r\n\r\n   Guestwick Manor,\r\n   Thursday, October, 186--.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then they went to see the pheasants. "Now, I\'ll tell you what,"\r\nsaid the earl. "I advise you to take to shooting. It\'s the amusement\r\nof a gentleman when a man chances to have the command of game."\r\n\r\n"But I\'m always up in London."\r\n\r\n"No, you\'re not. You\'re not up in London now. You always have your\r\nholidays. If you choose to try it, I\'ll see that you have shooting\r\nenough while you\'re here. It\'s better than going to sleep under the\r\ntrees. Ha, ha, ha! I wonder what made you lay yourself down there.\r\nYou hadn\'t been fighting a bull that day?"\r\n\r\n"No, my lord. I hadn\'t seen the bull then."\r\n\r\n"Well; you think of what I\'ve been saying. When I say a thing, I mean\r\nit. You shall have shooting enough, if you have a mind to try it."\r\nThen they looked at the pheasants, and pottered about the place till\r\nthe earl said it was time to dress for dinner. "That\'s hard upon you,\r\nisn\'t it?" said he. "But, at any rate, you can wash your hands, and\r\nget rid of the blood. I\'ll be down in the little drawing-room five\r\nminutes before seven, and I suppose I\'ll find you there."\r\n\r\nAt five minutes before seven Lord De Guest came into the small\r\ndrawing-room, and found Johnny seated there, with a book before him.\r\nThe earl was a little fussy, and showed by his manner that he was not\r\nquite at his ease, as some men do when they have any piece of work on\r\nhand which is not customary to them. He held something in his hand,\r\nand shuffled a little as he made his way up the room. He was dressed,\r\nas usual, in black; but his gold chain was not, as usual, dangling\r\nover his waistcoat.\r\n\r\n"Eames," he said, "I want you to accept a little present from\r\nme,--just as a memorial of our affair with the bull. It will make you\r\nthink of it sometimes, when I\'m perhaps gone."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my lord--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s my own watch, that I have been wearing for some time; but\r\nI\'ve got another;--two or three, I believe, somewhere upstairs. You\r\nmustn\'t refuse me. I can\'t bear being refused. There are two or three\r\nlittle seals, too, which I have worn. I have taken off the one with\r\nmy arms, because that\'s of no use to you, and it is to me. It doesn\'t\r\nwant a key, but winds up at the handle, in this way," and the earl\r\nproceeded to explain the nature of the toy.\r\n\r\n"My lord, you think too much of what happened to-day," said Eames,\r\nstammering.\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t; I think very little about it. I know what I think of.\r\nPut the watch in your pocket before the doctor comes. There; I hear\r\nhis horse. Why didn\'t he drive over, and then he could have taken you\r\nback?"\r\n\r\n"I can walk very well."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll make that all right. The servant shall ride Crofts\' horse,\r\nand bring back the little phaeton. How d\'you do, doctor? You know\r\nEames, I suppose? You needn\'t look at him in that way. His leg is not\r\nbroken; it\'s only his trowsers." And then the earl told the story of\r\nthe bull.\r\n\r\n"Johnny will become quite a hero in town," said Crofts.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I fear he\'ll get the most of the credit; and yet I was at it\r\ntwice as long as he was. I\'ll tell you what, young men, when I got\r\nto that gate I didn\'t think I\'d breath enough left in me to get\r\nover it. It\'s all very well jumping into a hedge when you\'re only\r\ntwo-and-twenty; but when a man comes to be sixty he likes to take his\r\ntime about such things. Dinner ready, is it? So am I. I quite forgot\r\nthat mutton chop of yours to-day, doctor. But I suppose a man may eat\r\na good dinner after a fight with a bull?"\r\n\r\nThe evening passed by without any very pleasurable excitement, and I\r\nregret to say that the earl went fast to sleep in the drawing-room as\r\nsoon as he had swallowed his cup of coffee. During dinner he had been\r\nvery courteous to both his guests, but towards Eames he had used a\r\ngood-humoured and almost affectionate familiarity. He had quizzed him\r\nfor having been found asleep under the tree, telling Crofts that he\r\nhad looked very forlorn,--"So that I haven\'t a doubt about his being\r\nin love," said the earl. And he had asked Johnny to tell the name\r\nof the fair one, bringing up the remnants of his half-forgotten\r\nclassicalities to bear out the joke. "If I am to take more of the\r\nsevere Falernian," said he, laying his hand on the decanter of port,\r\n"I must know the lady\'s name. Whoever she be, I\'m well sure you need\r\nnot blush for her. What! you refuse to tell! Then I\'ll drink no\r\nmore." And so the earl had walked out of the dining-room; but not\r\ntill he had perceived by his guest\'s cheeks that the joke had been\r\ntoo true to be pleasant. As he went, however, he leaned with his hand\r\non Eames\'s shoulder, and the servants looking on saw that the young\r\nman was to be a favourite. "He\'ll make him his heir," said Vickers.\r\n"I shouldn\'t wonder a bit if he don\'t make him his heir." But to this\r\nthe footman objected, endeavouring to prove to Mr. Vickers that, in\r\naccordance with the law of the land, his lordship\'s second cousin,\r\nonce removed, whom the earl had never seen, but whom he was supposed\r\nto hate, must be his heir. "A hearl can never choose his own heir,\r\nlike you or me," said the footman, laying down the law. "Can\'t he\r\nthough really, now? That\'s very hard on him; isn\'t it?" said the\r\npretty housemaid. "Psha," said Vickers: "you know nothing about it.\r\nMy lord could make young Eames his heir to-morrow; that is, the heir\r\nof his property. He couldn\'t make him a hearl, because that must go\r\nto the heirs of his body. As to his leaving him the place here, I\r\ndon\'t just know how that\'d be; and I\'m sure Richard don\'t."\r\n\r\n"But suppose he hasn\'t got any heirs of his body?" asked the pretty\r\nhousemaid, who was rather fond of putting down Mr. Vickers.\r\n\r\n"He must have heirs of his body," said the butler. "Everybody has\r\n\'em. If a man don\'t know \'em himself, the law finds \'em out." And\r\nthen Mr. Vickers walked away, avoiding further dispute.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the earl was asleep upstairs, and the two young men\r\nfrom Guestwick did not find that they could amuse themselves with any\r\nsatisfaction. Each took up a book; but there are times at which a\r\nman is quite unable to read, and when a book is only a cover for his\r\nidleness or dulness. At last, Dr. Crofts suggested, in a whisper,\r\nthat they might as well begin to think of going home.\r\n\r\n"Eh; yes; what?" said the earl: "I\'m not asleep." In answer to\r\nwhich the doctor said that he thought he\'d go home, if his lordship\r\nwould let him order his horse. But the earl was again fast bound in\r\nslumber, and took no further notice of the proposition.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps we could get off without waking him," suggested Eames, in a\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\n"Eh; what?" said the earl. So they both resumed their books, and\r\nsubmitted themselves to their martyrdom for a further period of\r\nfifteen minutes. At the expiration of that time, the footman brought\r\nin tea.\r\n\r\n"Eh, what? tea!" said the earl. "Yes, we\'ll have a little tea. I\'ve\r\nheard every word you\'ve been saying." It was that assertion on the\r\npart of the earl which always made Lady Julia so angry. "You cannot\r\nhave heard what I have been saying, Theodore, because I have said\r\nnothing," she would reply. "But I should have heard it if you had,"\r\nthe earl would rejoin, snappishly. On the present occasion neither\r\nCrofts nor Eames contradicted him, and he took his tea and swallowed\r\nit while still three parts asleep.\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll allow me, my lord, I think I\'ll order my horse," said the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n"Yes; horse--yes--" said the earl, nodding.\r\n\r\n"But what are you to do, Eames, if I ride?" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll walk," whispered Eames, in his very lowest voice.\r\n\r\n"What--what--what?" said the earl, jumping up on his feet. "Oh, ah,\r\nyes; going away, are you? I suppose you might as well, as sit here\r\nand see me sleeping. But, doctor--I didn\'t snore, did I?"\r\n\r\n"Only occasionally."\r\n\r\n"Not loud, did I? Come, Eames, did I snore loud?"\r\n\r\n"Well, my lord, you did snore rather loud two or three times."\r\n\r\n"Did I?" said the earl, in a voice of great disappointment. "And yet,\r\ndo you know, I heard every word you said."\r\n\r\nThe small phaeton had been already ordered, and the two young men\r\nstarted back to Guestwick together, a servant from the house riding\r\nthe doctor\'s horse behind them. "Look here, Eames," said the earl, as\r\nthey parted on the steps of the hall door. "You\'re going back to town\r\nthe day after to-morrow, you say, so I shan\'t see you again?"\r\n\r\n"No, my lord," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"Look you here, now. I shall be up for the Cattle-show before\r\nChristmas. You must dine with me at my hotel, on the twenty-second\r\nof December, Pawkins\'s, in Jermyn Street; seven o\'clock, sharp. Mind\r\nyou do not forget, now. Put it down in your pocket-book when you get\r\nhome. Good-by, doctor; good-by. I see I must stick to that mutton\r\nchop in the middle of the day." And then they drove off.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll make him his heir for certain," said Vickers to himself, as he\r\nslowly returned to his own quarters.\r\n\r\n"You were returning from Allington, I suppose," said Crofts, "when\r\nyou came across Lord De Guest and the bull?"\r\n\r\n"Yes: I just walked over to say good-by to them."\r\n\r\n"Did you find them all well?"\r\n\r\n"I only saw one. The other two were out."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Dale, was it?"\r\n\r\n"No; it was Lily."\r\n\r\n"Sitting alone, thinking of her fine London lover, of course? I\r\nsuppose we ought to look upon her as a very lucky girl. I have no\r\ndoubt she thinks herself so."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I don\'t know," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"I believe he\'s a very good young man," said the doctor; "but I can\'t\r\nsay I quite liked his manner."\r\n\r\n"I should think not," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"But then in all probability he did not like mine a bit better, or\r\nperhaps yours either. And if so it\'s all fair."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that it\'s a bit fair. He\'s a snob," said Eames; "and I\r\ndon\'t believe that I am." He had taken a glass or two of the earl\'s\r\n"severe Falernian," and was disposed to a more generous confidence,\r\nand perhaps also to stronger language, than might otherwise have been\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\n"No; I don\'t think he is a snob," said Crofts. "Had he been so, Mrs.\r\nDale would have perceived it."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll see," said Johnny, touching up the earl\'s horse with energy\r\nas he spoke. "You\'ll see. A man who gives himself airs is a snob; and\r\nhe gives himself airs. And I don\'t believe he\'s a straightforward\r\nfellow. It was a bad day for us all when he came among them at\r\nAllington."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say that I see that."\r\n\r\n"I do. But mind, I haven\'t spoken a word of this to any one. And\r\nI don\'t mean. What would be the good? I suppose she must marry him\r\nnow?"\r\n\r\n"Of course she must."\r\n\r\n"And be wretched all her life. Oh-h-h-h!" and he muttered a deep\r\ngroan. "I\'ll tell you what it is, Crofts. He is going to take the\r\nsweetest girl out of this country that ever was in it, and he don\'t\r\ndeserve her."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she can be compared to her sister," said Crofts\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n"What; not Lily?" said Eames, as though the proposition made by the\r\ndoctor were one that could not hold water for a minute.\r\n\r\n"I have always thought that Bell was the more admired of the two,"\r\nsaid Crofts.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what," said Eames. "I have never yet set my eyes on\r\nany human creature whom I thought so beautiful as Lily Dale. And now\r\nthat beast is going to marry her! I\'ll tell you what, Crofts; I\'ll\r\nmanage to pick a quarrel with him yet." Whereupon the doctor, seeing\r\nthe nature of the complaint from which his companion was suffering,\r\nsaid nothing more, either about Lily or about Bell.\r\n\r\nSoon after this Eames was at his own door, and was received there by\r\nhis mother and sister with all the enthusiasm due to a hero. "He has\r\nsaved the earl\'s life!" Mrs. Eames had exclaimed to her daughter on\r\nreading Lord De Guest\'s note. "Oh, goodness!" and she threw herself\r\nback upon the sofa almost in a fainting condition.\r\n\r\n"Saved Lord De Guest\'s life!" said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Yes--under Providence," said Mrs. Eames, as though that latter fact\r\nadded much to her son\'s good deed.\r\n\r\n"But how did he do it?"\r\n\r\n"By cool courage and good feeling--so his lordship says. But I wonder\r\nhow he really did do it?"\r\n\r\n"Whatever way it was, he\'s torn all his clothes and lost his hat,"\r\nsaid Mary.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care a bit about that," said Mrs. Eames. "I wonder whether\r\nthe earl has any interest at the Income-tax.\r\n\r\n"What a thing it would be if he could get Johnny a step. It would be\r\nseventy pounds a year at once. He was quite right to stay and dine\r\nwhen his lordship asked him. And so Dr. Crofts is there. It couldn\'t\r\nhave been anything in the doctoring way, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"No, I should say not; because of what he says of his trowsers." And\r\nso the two ladies were obliged to wait for John\'s return.\r\n\r\n"How did you do it, John?" said his mother, embracing him, as soon as\r\nthe door was opened.\r\n\r\n"How did you save the earl\'s life?" said Mary, who was standing\r\nbehind her mother.\r\n\r\n"Would his lordship really have been killed, if it had not been for\r\nyou?" asked Mrs. Eames.\r\n\r\n"And was he very much hurt?" asked Mary.\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother," said Johnny, on whom the results of the day\'s work,\r\ntogether with the earl\'s Falernian, had made some still remaining\r\nimpression. On ordinary occasions, Mrs. Eames would have felt hurt at\r\nbeing so answered by her son; but at the present moment she regarded\r\nhim as standing so high in general favour that she took no offence.\r\n"Oh, Johnny, do tell us. Of course we must be very anxious to know it\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing to tell, except that a bull ran at the earl, as I\r\nwas going by; so I went into the field and helped him, and then he\r\nmade me stay and dine with him."\r\n\r\n"But his lordship says that you saved his life," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Under Providence," added their mother.\r\n\r\n"At any rate, he has given me a gold watch and chain," said Johnny,\r\ndrawing the present out of his pocket. "I wanted a watch badly. All\r\nthe same, I didn\'t like taking it."\r\n\r\n"It would have been very wrong to refuse," said his mother. "And I\r\nam so glad you have been so fortunate. And look here, Johnny: when\r\na friend like that comes in your way, don\'t turn your back on him."\r\nThen, at last, he thawed beneath their kindness, and told them the\r\nwhole of the story. I fear that in recounting the earl\'s efforts with\r\nthe spud, he hardly spoke of his patron with all that deference which\r\nwould have been appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nMR. PLANTAGENET PALLISER.\r\n\r\n\r\nA week passed over Mr. Crosbie\'s head at Courcy Castle without much\r\ninconvenience to him from the well-known fact of his matrimonial\r\nengagement. Both George De Courcy and John De Courcy had in their\r\ndifferent ways charged him with his offence, and endeavoured to annoy\r\nhim by recurring to the subject; but he did not care much for the\r\nwit or malice of George or John De Courcy. The countess had hardly\r\nalluded to Lily Dale after those few words which she said on the\r\nfirst day of his visit, and seemed perfectly willing to regard his\r\ndoings at Allington as the occupation natural to a young man in such\r\na position. He had been seduced down to a dull country house, and\r\nhad, as a matter of course, taken to such amusements as the place\r\nafforded. He had shot the partridges and made love to the young lady,\r\ntaking those little recreations as compensation for the tedium of the\r\nsquire\'s society. Perhaps he had gone a little too far with the young\r\nlady; but then no one knew better than the countess how difficult it\r\nis for a young man to go far enough without going too far. It was not\r\nher business to make herself a censor on a young man\'s conduct. The\r\nblame, no doubt, rested quite as much with Miss Dale as with him. She\r\nwas quite sorry that any young lady should be disappointed; but if\r\ngirls will be imprudent, and set their caps at men above their mark,\r\nthey must encounter disappointment. With such language did Lady De\r\nCourcy speak of the affair among her daughters, and her daughters\r\naltogether agreed with her that it was out of the question that\r\nMr. Crosbie should marry Lily Dale. From Alexandrina he encountered\r\nduring the week none of that raillery which he had expected. He\r\nhad promised to explain to her before he left the castle all the\r\ncircumstances of his acquaintance with Lily, and she at last showed\r\nherself determined to demand the fulfilment of this promise; but,\r\nprevious to that, she said nothing to manifest either offence or a\r\nlessened friendship. And I regret to say, that in the intercourse\r\nwhich had taken place between them, that friendship was by no means\r\nless tender that it had been in London.\r\n\r\n"And when will you tell me what you promised?" she asked him one\r\nafternoon, speaking in a low voice, as they were standing together at\r\nthe window of the billiard-room, in that idle half-hour which always\r\noccurs before the necessity for dinner preparation has come. She had\r\nbeen riding and was still in her habit, and he had returned from\r\nshooting. She knew that she looked more than ordinarily well in her\r\ntall straight hat and riding gear, and was wont to hang about the\r\nhouse, walking skilfully with her upheld drapery, during this period\r\nof the day. It was dusk, but not dark, and there was no artificial\r\nlight in the billiard-room. There had been some pretence of knocking\r\nabout the balls, but it had been only pretence. "Even Diana," she had\r\nsaid, "could not have played billiards in a habit." Then she had put\r\ndown her mace, and they had stood talking together in the recess of a\r\nlarge bow-window.\r\n\r\n"And what did I promise?" said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"You know well enough. Not that it is a matter of any special\r\ninterest to me; only, as you undertook to promise, of course my\r\ncuriosity has been raised."\r\n\r\n"If it be of no special interest," said Crosbie, "you will not object\r\nto absolve me from my promise."\r\n\r\n"That is just like you," she said. "And how false you men always are.\r\nYou made up your mind to buy my silence on a distasteful subject by\r\npretending to offer me your future confidence; and now you tell me\r\nthat you do not mean to confide in me."\r\n\r\n"You begin by telling me that the matter is one that does not in the\r\nleast interest you."\r\n\r\n"That is so false again! You know very well what I meant. Do you\r\nremember what you said to me the day you came? and am I not bound to\r\ntell you after that, that your marriage with this or that young lady\r\nis not matter of special interest to me? Still, as your friend--"\r\n\r\n"Well, as my friend!"\r\n\r\n"I shall be glad to know--. But I am not going to beg for your\r\nconfidence; only I tell you this fairly, that no man is so mean in my\r\neyes as a man who fights under false colours."\r\n\r\n"And am I fighting under false colours?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you are." And now, as she spoke, the Lady Alexandrina blushed\r\nbeneath her hat; and dull as was the remaining light of the evening,\r\nCrosbie, looking into her face, saw her heightened colour. "Yes, you\r\nare. A gentleman is fighting under false colours who comes into a\r\nhouse like this, with a public rumour of his being engaged, and then\r\nconducts himself as though nothing of the kind existed. Of course,\r\nit is not anything to me specially; but that is fighting under false\r\ncolours. Now, sir, you may redeem the promise you made me when you\r\nfirst came here,--or you may let it alone."\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged that the lady was fighting her battle with\r\nmuch courage, and also with some skill. In three or four days Crosbie\r\nwould be gone; and this victory, if it were ever to be gained, must\r\nbe gained in those three or four days. And if there were to be no\r\nvictory, then it would be only fair that Crosbie should be punished\r\nfor his duplicity, and that she should be avenged as far as any\r\nrevenge might be in her power. Not that she meditated any deep\r\nrevenge, or was prepared to feel any strong anger. She liked Crosbie\r\nas well as she had ever liked any man. She believed that he liked her\r\nalso. She had no conception of any very strong passion, but conceived\r\nthat a married life was more pleasant than one of single bliss. She\r\nhad no doubt that he had promised to make Lily Dale his wife, but\r\nso had he previously promised her, or nearly so. It was a fair game,\r\nand she would win it if she could. If she failed, she would show her\r\nanger; but she would show it in a mild, weak manner,--turning up her\r\nnose at Lily before Crosbie\'s face, and saying little things against\r\nhimself behind his back. Her wrath would not carry her much beyond\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n"Now, sir, you may redeem the promise you made me when you first came\r\nhere,--or you may let it alone." So she spoke, and then she turned\r\nher face away from him, gazing out into the darkness.\r\n\r\n"Alexandrina!" he said.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir? But you have no right to speak to me in that style. You\r\nknow that you have no right to call me by my name in that way!"\r\n\r\n"You mean that you insist upon your title?"\r\n\r\n"All ladies insist on what you call their title, from gentlemen,\r\nexcept under the privilege of greater intimacy than you have the\r\nright to claim. You did not call Miss Dale by her Christian name till\r\nyou had obtained permission, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"You used to let me call you so."\r\n\r\n"Never! Once or twice, when you have done so, I have not forbidden\r\nit, as I should have done. Very well, sir, as you have nothing to\r\ntell me, I will leave you. I must confess that I did not think you\r\nwere such a coward." And she prepared to go, gathering up the skirts\r\nof her habit, and taking up the whip which she had laid on the\r\nwindow-sill.\r\n\r\n"Stay a moment, Alexandrina," he said; "I am not happy, and you\r\nshould not say words intended to make me more miserable."\r\n\r\n"And why are you unhappy?"\r\n\r\n"Because-- I will tell you instantly, if I may believe that I am\r\ntelling you only, and not the whole household."\r\n\r\n"Of course I shall not talk of it to others. Do you think that I\r\ncannot keep a secret?"\r\n\r\n"It is because I have promised to marry one woman, and because I love\r\nanother. I have told you everything now; and if you choose to say\r\nagain that I am fighting under false colours I will leave the castle\r\nbefore you can see me again."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Crosbie!"\r\n\r\n"Now you know it all, and may imagine whether or no I am very happy.\r\nI think you said it was time to dress;--suppose we go?" And without\r\nfurther speech the two went off to their separate rooms.\r\n\r\nCrosbie, as soon as he was alone in his chamber, sat himself down in\r\nhis arm-chair, and went to work striving to make up his mind as to\r\nhis future conduct. It must not be supposed that the declaration just\r\nmade by him had been produced solely by his difficulty at the moment.\r\nThe atmosphere of Courcy Castle had been at work upon him for the\r\nlast week past. And every word that he had heard, and every word\r\nthat he had spoken, had tended to destroy all that was good and true\r\nwithin him, and to foster all that was selfish and false. He had said\r\nto himself a dozen times during that week that he never could be\r\nhappy with Lily Dale, and that he never could make her happy. And\r\nthen he had used the old sophistry in his endeavour to teach himself\r\nthat it was right to do that which he wished to do. Would it not be\r\nbetter for Lily that he should desert her, than marry her against\r\nthe dictates of his own heart? And if he really did not love her,\r\nwould he not be committing a greater crime in marrying her than in\r\ndeserting her? He confessed to himself that he had been very wrong in\r\nallowing the outer world to get such a hold upon him that the love of\r\na pure girl like Lily could not suffice for his happiness. But there\r\nwas the fact, and he found himself unable to contend against it. If\r\nby any absolute self-sacrifice he could secure Lily\'s well-being, he\r\nwould not hesitate for a moment. But would it be well to sacrifice\r\nher as well as himself?\r\n\r\nHe had discussed the matter in this way within his own breast, till\r\nhe had almost taught himself to believe that it was his duty to break\r\noff his engagement with Lily; and he had also almost taught himself\r\nto believe that a marriage with a daughter of the house of Courcy\r\nwould satisfy his ambition and assist him in his battle with the\r\nworld. That Lady Alexandrina would accept him he felt certain, if he\r\ncould only induce her to forgive him for his sin in becoming engaged\r\nto Miss Dale. How very prone she would be to forgiveness in this\r\nmatter, he had not divined, having not as yet learned how easily such\r\na woman can forgive such a sin, if the ultimate triumph be accorded\r\nto herself.\r\n\r\nAnd there was another reason which operated much with Crosbie, urging\r\nhim on in his present mood and wishes, though it should have given\r\nan exactly opposite impulse to his heart. He had hesitated as to\r\nmarrying Lily Dale at once, because of the smallness of his income.\r\nNow he had a prospect of considerable increase to that income.\r\nOne of the commissioners at his office had been promoted to some\r\ngreater commissionership, and it was understood by everybody that\r\nthe secretary at the General Committee Office would be the new\r\ncommissioner. As to that there was no doubt. But then the question\r\nhad arisen as to the place of secretary. Crosbie had received two or\r\nthree letters on the subject, and it seemed that the likelihood of\r\nhis obtaining this step in the world was by no means slight. It would\r\nincrease his official income from seven hundred a year to twelve, and\r\nwould place him altogether above the world. His friend, the present\r\nsecretary, had written to him, assuring him that no other probable\r\ncompetitor was spoken of as being in the field against him. If such\r\ngood fortune awaited him, would it not smooth any present difficulty\r\nwhich lay in the way of his marriage with Lily Dale? But, alas, he\r\nhad not looked at the matter in that light! Might not the countess\r\nhelp him to this preferment? And if his destiny intended for him\r\nthe good things of this world,--secretaryships, commissionerships,\r\nchairmanships, and such like, would it not be well that he should\r\nstruggle on in his upward path by such assistance as good connections\r\nmight give him?\r\n\r\nHe sat thinking over it all in his own room on that evening. He had\r\nwritten twice to Lily since his arrival at Courcy Castle. His first\r\nletter has been given. His second was written much in the same tone;\r\nthough Lily, as she had read it, had unconsciously felt somewhat\r\nless satisfied than she had been with the first. Expressions of\r\nlove were not wanting, but they were vague and without heartiness.\r\nThey savoured of insincerity, though there was nothing in the words\r\nthemselves to convict them. Few liars can lie with the full roundness\r\nand self-sufficiency of truth; and Crosbie, bad as he was, had not\r\nyet become bad enough to reach that perfection. He had said nothing\r\nto Lily of the hopes of promotion which had been opened to him; but\r\nhe had again spoken of his own worldliness--acknowledging that he\r\nreceived an unsatisfying satisfaction from the pomps and vanities of\r\nCourcy Castle. In fact he was paving the way for that which he had\r\nalmost resolved that he would do, now he had told Lady Alexandrina\r\nthat he loved her; and he was obliged to confess to himself that the\r\ndie was cast.\r\n\r\nAs he thought of all this, there was not wanting to him some of the\r\nsatisfaction of an escape. Soon after making that declaration of love\r\nat Allington he had begun to feel that in making it he had cut his\r\nthroat. He had endeavoured to persuade himself that he could live\r\ncomfortably with his throat cut in that way; and as long as Lily was\r\nwith him he would believe that he could do so; but as soon as he was\r\nagain alone he would again accuse himself of suicide. This was his\r\nframe of mind even while he was yet at Allington, and his ideas on\r\nthe subject had become stronger during his sojourn at Courcy. But the\r\nself-immolation had not been completed, and he now began to think\r\nthat he could save himself. I need hardly say that this was not all\r\ntriumph to him. Even had there been no material difficulty as to his\r\ndesertion of Lily,--no uncle, cousin, and mother whose anger he must\r\nface,--no vision of a pale face, more eloquent of wrong in its\r\nsilence than even uncle, cousin, and mother, with their indignant\r\nstorm of words,--he was not altogether heartless. How should he tell\r\nall this to the girl who had loved him so well; who had so loved him,\r\nthat, as he himself felt, her love would fashion all her future life\r\neither for weal or for woe? "I am unworthy of her, and will tell\r\nher so," he said to himself. How many a false hound of a man has\r\nendeavoured to salve his own conscience by such mock humility? But\r\nhe acknowledged at this moment, as he rose from his seat to dress\r\nhimself, that the die was cast, and that it was open to him now to\r\nsay what he pleased to Lady Alexandrina. "Others have gone through\r\nthe same fire before," he said to himself, as he walked downstairs,\r\n"and have come out scatheless." And then he recalled to himself the\r\nnames of various men of high repute in the world who were supposed to\r\nhave committed in their younger days some such little mistake as that\r\ninto which he had been betrayed.\r\n\r\nIn passing through the hall he overtook Lady Julia De Guest, and\r\nwas in time to open for her the door of the drawing-room. He then\r\nremembered that she had come into the billiard-room at one side, and\r\nhad gone out at the other, while he was standing with Alexandrina at\r\nthe window. He had not, however, then thought much of Lady Julia; and\r\nas he now stood for her to pass by him through the door-way, he made\r\nto her some indifferent remark.\r\n\r\nBut Lady Julia was on some subjects a stern woman, and not without\r\na certain amount of courage. In the last week she had seen what had\r\nbeen going on, and had become more and more angry. Though she had\r\ndisowned any family connection with Lily Dale, nevertheless she now\r\nfelt for her sympathy and almost affection. Nearly every day she had\r\nrepeated stiffly to the countess some incident of Crosbie\'s courtship\r\nand engagement to Miss Dale,--speaking of it as with absolute\r\nknowledge, as a thing settled at all points. This she had done to the\r\ncountess alone, in the presence of the countess and Alexandrina, and\r\nalso before all the female guests of the castle. But what she had\r\nsaid was received simply with an incredulous smile. "Dear me! Lady\r\nJulia," the countess had replied at last, "I shall begin to think you\r\nare in love with Mr. Crosbie yourself; you harp so constantly on this\r\naffair of his. One would think that young ladies in your part of the\r\nworld must find it very difficult to get husbands, seeing that the\r\nsuccess of one young lady is trumpeted so loudly." For the moment,\r\nLady Julia was silenced; but it was not easy to silence her\r\naltogether when she had a subject for speech near her heart.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the Courcy world were assembled in the drawing-room as\r\nshe now walked into the room with Crosbie at her heels. When she\r\nfound herself near the crowd she turned round, and addressed him in\r\na voice more audible than that generally required for purposes of\r\ndrawing-room conversation. "Mr. Crosbie," she said, "have you heard\r\nlately from our dear friend, Lily Dale?" And she looked him full in\r\nthe face, in a manner more significant, probably, than even she had\r\nintended it to be. There was, at once, a general hush in the room,\r\nand all eyes were turned upon her and upon him.\r\n\r\nCrosbie instantly made an effort to bear the attack gallantly, but he\r\nfelt that he could not quite command his colour, or prevent a sudden\r\ndrop of perspiration from showing itself upon his brow. "I had a\r\nletter from Allington yesterday," he said. "I suppose you have heard\r\nof your brother\'s encounter with the bull?"\r\n\r\n"The bull!" said Lady Julia. And it was instantly manifest to all\r\nthat her attack had been foiled and her flank turned.\r\n\r\n"Good gracious! Lady Julia, how very odd you are!" said the countess.\r\n\r\n"But what about the bull?" asked the Honourable George.\r\n\r\n"It seems that the earl was knocked down in the middle of one of his\r\nown fields."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear!" exclaimed Alexandrina. And sundry other exclamations were\r\nmade by all the assembled ladies.\r\n\r\n"But he wasn\'t hurt," said Crosbie. "A young man named Eames seems to\r\nhave fallen from the sky and carried off the earl on his back."\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha, ha, ha!" growled the other earl, as he heard of the\r\ndiscomfiture of his brother peer.\r\n\r\nLady Julia, who had received her own letters that day from Guestwick,\r\nknew that nothing of importance had happened to her brother; but she\r\nfelt that she was foiled for that time.\r\n\r\n"I hope that there has not really been any accident," said Mr.\r\nGazebee, with a voice of great solicitude.\r\n\r\n"My brother was quite well last night, thank you," said she. And then\r\nthe little groups again formed themselves, and Lady Julia was left\r\nalone on the corner of a sofa.\r\n\r\n"Was that all an invention of yours, sir?" said Alexandrina to\r\nCrosbie.\r\n\r\n"Not quite. I did get a letter this morning from my friend Bernard\r\nDale,--that old harridan\'s nephew; and Lord De Guest has been worried\r\nby some of his animals. I wish I had told her that his stupid old\r\nneck had been broken."\r\n\r\n"Fie, Mr. Crosbie!"\r\n\r\n"What business has she to interfere with me?"\r\n\r\n"But I mean to ask the same question that she asked, and you won\'t\r\nput me off with a cock-and-bull story like that." But then, as she\r\nwas going to ask the question, dinner was announced.\r\n\r\n"And is it true that De Guest has been tossed by a bull?" said the\r\nearl, as soon as the ladies were gone. He had spoken nothing during\r\ndinner except what words he had muttered into the ear of Lady\r\nDumbello. It was seldom that conversation had many charms for him in\r\nhis own house; but there was a savour of pleasantry in the idea of\r\nLord De Guest having been tossed, by which even he was tickled.\r\n\r\n"Only knocked down, I believe," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha, ha!" growled the earl; then he filled his glass, and allowed\r\nsome one else to pass the bottle. Poor man! There was not much left\r\nto him now in the world which did amuse him.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see anything to laugh at," said Plantagenet Palliser, who\r\nwas sitting at the earl\'s right hand, opposite to Lord Dumbello.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you?" said the earl. "Ha, ha, ha!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be shot if I do. From all I hear De Guest is an uncommon good\r\nfarmer. And I don\'t see the joke of tossing a farmer merely because\r\nhe\'s a nobleman also. Do you?" and he turned round to Mr. Gazebee,\r\nwho was sitting on the other side. The earl was an earl, and was also\r\nMr. Gazebee\'s father-in-law. Mr. Plantagenet Palliser was the heir to\r\na dukedom. Therefore, Mr. Gazebee merely simpered, and did not answer\r\nthe question put to him. Mr. Palliser said nothing more about it, nor\r\ndid the earl; and then the joke died away.\r\n\r\nMr. Plantagenet Palliser was the Duke of Omnium\'s heir--heir to\r\nthat nobleman\'s title and to his enormous wealth; and, therefore,\r\nwas a man of mark in the world. He sat in the House of Commons, of\r\ncourse. He was about five-and-twenty years of age, and was, as yet,\r\nunmarried. He did not hunt or shoot or keep a yacht, and had been\r\nheard to say that he had never put a foot upon a race-course in his\r\nlife. He dressed very quietly, never changing the colour or form of\r\nhis garments; and in society was quiet, reserved, and very often\r\nsilent. He was tall, slight, and not ill-looking; but more than this\r\ncannot be said for his personal appearance--except, indeed, this,\r\nthat no one could mistake him for other than a gentleman. With his\r\nuncle, the duke, he was on good terms--that is to say, they had never\r\nquarrelled. A very liberal allowance had been made to the nephew; but\r\nthe two relatives had no tastes in common, and did not often meet.\r\nOnce a year Mr. Palliser visited the duke at his great country seat\r\nfor two or three days, and usually dined with him two or three times\r\nduring the season in London. Mr. Palliser sat for a borough which was\r\nabsolutely under the duke\'s command; but had accepted his seat under\r\nthe distinct understanding that he was to take whatever part in\r\npolitics might seem good to himself. Under these well-understood\r\narrangements, the duke and his heir showed to the world quite a\r\npattern of a happy family. "So different to the earl and Lord\r\nPorlock!" the people of West Barsetshire used to say. For the\r\nestates, both of the duke and of the earl, were situated in the\r\nwestern division of that county.\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser was chiefly known to the world as a rising politician.\r\nWe may say that he had everything at his command, in the way of\r\npleasure, that the world could offer him. He had wealth, position,\r\npower, and the certainty of attaining the highest rank among,\r\nperhaps, the most brilliant nobility of the world. He was courted by\r\nall who could get near enough to court him. It is hardly too much\r\nto say that he might have selected a bride from all that was most\r\nbeautiful and best among English women. If he would have bought\r\nrace-horses, and have expended thousands on the turf, he would have\r\ngratified his uncle by doing so. He might have been the master\r\nof hounds, or the slaughterer of hecatombs of birds. But to none\r\nof these things would he devote himself. He had chosen to be\r\na politician, and in that pursuit he laboured with a zeal and\r\nperseverance which would have made his fortune at any profession\r\nor in any trade. He was constant in committee-rooms up to the very\r\nmiddle of August. He was rarely absent from any debate of importance,\r\nand never from any important division. Though he seldom spoke, he was\r\nalways ready to speak if his purpose required it. No man gave him\r\ncredit for any great genius--few even considered that he could become\r\neither an orator or a mighty statesman. But the world said that he\r\nwas a rising man, and old Nestor of the Cabinet looked on him as one\r\nwho would be able, at some far future day, to come among them as a\r\nyounger brother. Hitherto he had declined such inferior offices as\r\nhad been offered to him, biding his time carefully; and he was as yet\r\ntied hand and neck to no party, though known to be liberal in all his\r\npolitical tendencies. He was a great reader--not taking up a book\r\nhere, and another there, as chance brought books before him, but\r\nworking through an enormous course of books, getting up the great\r\nsubject of the world\'s history--filling himself full of facts--though\r\nperhaps not destined to acquire the power of using those facts\r\notherwise than as precedents. He strove also diligently to become a\r\nlinguist--not without success, as far as a competent understanding of\r\nvarious languages. He was a thin-minded, plodding, respectable man,\r\nwilling to devote all his youth to work, in order that in old age he\r\nmight be allowed to sit among the Councillors of the State.\r\n\r\nHitherto his name had not been coupled by the world with that of any\r\nwoman whom he had been supposed to admire; but latterly it had been\r\nobserved that he had often been seen in the same room with Lady\r\nDumbello. It had hardly amounted to more than this; but when it was\r\nremembered how undemonstrative were the two persons concerned--how\r\nlittle disposed was either of them to any strong display of\r\nfeeling--even this was thought matter to be mentioned. He certainly\r\nwould speak to her from time to time almost with an air of interest;\r\nand Lady Dumbello, when she saw that he was in the room, would be\r\nobserved to raise her head with some little show of life, and to\r\nlook round as though there were something there on which it might be\r\nworth her while to allow her eyes to rest. When such innuendoes were\r\nabroad, no one would probably make more of them than Lady De Courcy.\r\nMany, when they heard that Mr. Palliser was to be at the castle, had\r\nexpressed their surprise at her success in that quarter. Others, when\r\nthey learned that Lady Dumbello had consented to become her guest,\r\nhad also wondered greatly. But when it was ascertained that the two\r\nwere to be there together, her good-natured friends had acknowledged\r\nthat she was a very clever woman. To have either Mr. Palliser or Lady\r\nDumbello would have been a feather in her cap; but to succeed in\r\ngetting both, by enabling each to know that the other would be there,\r\nwas indeed a triumph. As regards Lady Dumbello, however, the bargain\r\nwas not fairly carried out; for, after all, Mr. Palliser came to\r\nCourcy Castle only for two nights and a day, and during the whole of\r\nthat day he was closeted with sundry large blue-books. As for Lady\r\nDe Courcy, she did not care how he might be employed. Blue-books and\r\nLady Dumbello were all the same to her. Mr. Palliser had been at\r\nCourcy Castle, and neither enemy nor friend could deny the fact.\r\n\r\nThis was his second evening; and as he had promised to meet his\r\nconstituents at Silverbridge at one P.M. on the following day, with\r\nthe view of explaining to them his own conduct and the political\r\nposition of the world in general; and as he was not to return from\r\nSilverbridge to Courcy, Lady Dumbello, if she made any way at all,\r\nmust take advantage of the short gleam of sunshine which the present\r\nhour afforded her. No one, however, could say that she showed any\r\nactive disposition to monopolize Mr. Palliser\'s attention. When he\r\nsauntered into the drawing-room she was sitting, alone, in a large,\r\nlow chair, made without arms, so as to admit the full expansion of\r\nher dress, but hollowed and round at the back, so as to afford her\r\nthe support that was necessary to her. She had barely spoken three\r\nwords since she had left the dining-room, but the time had not passed\r\nheavily with her. Lady Julia had again attacked the countess about\r\nLily Dale and Mr. Crosbie, and Alexandrina, driven almost to rage,\r\nhad stalked off to the farther end of the room, not concealing her\r\nspecial concern in the matter.\r\n\r\n"How I do wish they were married and done with," said the countess;\r\n"and then we should hear no more about them."\r\n\r\nAll of which Lady Dumbello heard and understood; and in all of it she\r\ntook a certain interest. She remembered such things, learning thereby\r\nwho was who, and regulating her own conduct by what she learned. She\r\nwas by no means idle at this or at other such times, going through,\r\nwe may say, a considerable amount of really hard work in her manner\r\nof working. There she had sat speechless, unless when acknowledging\r\nby a low word of assent some expression of flattery from those around\r\nher. Then the door opened, and when Mr. Palliser entered she raised\r\nher head, and the faintest possible gleam of satisfaction might have\r\nbeen discerned upon her features. But she made no attempt to speak\r\nto him; and when, as he stood at the table, he took up a book and\r\nremained thus standing for a quarter of an hour, she neither showed\r\nnor felt any impatience. After that Lord Dumbello came in, and he\r\nstood at the table without a book. Even then Lady Dumbello felt no\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\nPlantagenet Palliser skimmed through his little book, and probably\r\nlearned something. When he put it down he sipped a cup of tea, and\r\nremarked to Lady De Courcy that he believed it was only twelve miles\r\nto Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"I wish it was a hundred and twelve," said the countess.\r\n\r\n"In that case I should be forced to start to-night," said Mr.\r\nPalliser.\r\n\r\n"Then I wish it was a thousand and twelve," said Lady De Courcy.\r\n\r\n"In that case I should not have come at all," said Mr. Palliser. He\r\ndid not mean to be uncivil, and had only stated a fact.\r\n\r\n"The young men are becoming absolute bears," said the countess to her\r\ndaughter Margaretta.\r\n\r\nHe had been in the room nearly an hour when he did at last find\r\nhimself standing close to Lady Dumbello: close to her, and without\r\nany other very near neighbour.\r\n\r\n"I should hardly have expected to find you here," he said.\r\n\r\n"Nor I you," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Though, for the matter of that, we are both near our own homes."\r\n\r\n"I am not near mine."\r\n\r\n"I meant Plumstead; your father\'s place."\r\n\r\n"Yes; that was my home once."\r\n\r\n"I wish I could show you my uncle\'s place. The castle is very fine,\r\nand he has some good pictures."\r\n\r\n"So I have heard."\r\n\r\n"Do you stay here long?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. I go to Cheshire the day after to-morrow. Lord Dumbello is\r\nalways there when the hunting begins."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; of course. What a happy fellow he is; never any work to do!\r\nHis constituents never trouble him, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think they ever do, much."\r\n\r\nAfter that Mr. Palliser sauntered away again, and Lady Dumbello\r\npassed the rest of the evening in silence. It is to be hoped\r\nthat they both were rewarded by that ten minutes of sympathetic\r\nintercourse for the inconvenience which they had suffered in coming\r\nto Courcy Castle.\r\n\r\nBut that which seems so innocent to us had been looked on in a\r\ndifferent light by the stern moralists of that house.\r\n\r\n"By Jove!" said the Honourable George to his cousin, Mr. Gresham,\r\n"I wonder how Dumbello likes it."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me that Dumbello takes it very easily."\r\n\r\n"There are some men who will take anything easily," said George, who,\r\nsince his own marriage, had learned to have a holy horror of such\r\nwicked things.\r\n\r\n"She\'s beginning to come out a little," said Lady Clandidlem to Lady\r\nDe Courcy, when the two old women found themselves together over a\r\nfire in some back sitting-room. "Still waters always run deep, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t at all wonder if she were to go off with him," said Lady\r\nDe Courcy.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll never be such a fool as that," said Lady Clandidlem.\r\n\r\n"I believe men will be fools enough for anything," said Lady De\r\nCourcy. "But, of course, if he did, it would come to nothing\r\nafterwards. I know one who would not be sorry. If ever a man was\r\ntired of a woman, Lord Dumbello is tired of her."\r\n\r\nBut in this, as in almost everything else, the wicked old woman spoke\r\nscandal. Lord Dumbello was still proud of his wife, and as fond of\r\nher as a man can be of a woman whose fondness depends upon mere\r\npride.\r\n\r\nThere had not been much that was dangerous in the conversation\r\nbetween Mr. Palliser and Lady Dumbello, but I cannot say the same as\r\nto that which was going on at the same moment between Crosbie and\r\nLady Alexandrina. She, as I have said, walked away in almost open\r\ndudgeon when Lady Julia recommenced her attack about poor Lily, nor\r\ndid she return to the general circle during the evening. There were\r\ntwo large drawing-rooms at Courcy Castle, joined together by a narrow\r\nlink of a room, which might have been called a passage, had it not\r\nbeen lighted by two windows coming down to the floor, carpeted as\r\nwere the drawing-rooms, and warmed with a separate fireplace. Hither\r\nshe betook herself, and was soon followed by her married sister\r\nAmelia.\r\n\r\n"That woman almost drives me mad," said Alexandrina, as they stood\r\ntogether with their toes upon the fender.\r\n\r\n"But, my dear, you of all people should not allow yourself to be\r\ndriven mad on such a subject."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very well, Amelia."\r\n\r\n"The question is this, my dear,--what does Mr. Crosbie mean to do?"\r\n\r\n"How should I know?"\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t know, it will be safer to suppose that he is going to\r\nmarry this girl; and in that case--"\r\n\r\n"Well, what in that case? Are you going to be another Lady Julia?\r\nWhat do I care about the girl?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose you care much about the girl; and if you care as\r\nlittle about Mr. Crosbie, there\'s an end of it; only in that case,\r\nAlexandrina--"\r\n\r\n"Well, what in that case?"\r\n\r\n"You know I don\'t want to preach to you. Can\'t you tell me at\r\nonce whether you really like him? You and I have always been good\r\nfriends." And the married sister put her arm affectionately round the\r\nwaist of her who wished to be married.\r\n\r\n"I like him well enough."\r\n\r\n"And has he made any declaration to you?"\r\n\r\n"In a sort of a way he has. Hark, here he is!" And Crosbie, coming in\r\nfrom the larger room, joined the sisters at the fireplace.\r\n\r\n"We were driven away by the clack of Lady Julia\'s tongue," said the\r\nelder.\r\n\r\n"I never met such a woman," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"There cannot well be many like her," said Alexandrina. And after\r\nthat they all stood silent for a minute or two. Lady Amelia Gazebee\r\nwas considering whether or no she would do well to go and leave the\r\ntwo together. If it were intended that Mr. Crosbie should marry her\r\nsister, it would certainly be well to give him an opportunity of\r\nexpressing such a wish on his own part. But if Alexandrina was simply\r\nmaking a fool of herself, then it would be well for her to stay.\r\n"I suppose she would rather I should go," said the elder sister\r\nto herself; and then, obeying the rule which should guide all our\r\nactions from one to another, she went back and joined the crowd.\r\n\r\n"Will you come on into the other room?" said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"I think we are very well here," Alexandrina replied.\r\n\r\n"But I wish to speak to you,--particularly," said he.\r\n\r\n"And cannot you speak here?"\r\n\r\n"No. They will be passing backwards and forwards." Lady Alexandrina\r\nsaid nothing further, but led the way into the other large room. That\r\nalso was lighted, and there were in it four or five persons. Lady\r\nRosina was reading a work on the Millennium, with a light to herself\r\nin one corner. Her brother John was asleep in an arm-chair, and a\r\nyoung gentleman and lady were playing chess. There was, however,\r\nample room for Crosbie and Alexandrina to take up a position apart.\r\n\r\n"And now, Mr. Crosbie, what have you got to say to me? But, first,\r\nI mean to repeat Lady Julia\'s question, as I told you that I should\r\ndo.--When did you hear last from Miss Dale?"\r\n\r\n"It is cruel in you to ask me such a question, after what I have\r\nalready told you. You know that I have given to Miss Dale a promise\r\nof marriage."\r\n\r\n"Very well, sir. I don\'t see why you should bring me in here to tell\r\nme anything that is so publicly known as that. With such a herald as\r\nLady Julia it was quite unnecessary."\r\n\r\n"If you can only answer me in that tone I will make an end of it at\r\nonce. When I told you of my engagement, I told you also that another\r\nwoman possessed my heart. Am I wrong to suppose that you knew to whom\r\nI alluded?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I did not, Mr. Crosbie. I am no conjuror, and I have not\r\nscrutinized you so closely as your friend Lady Julia."\r\n\r\n"It is you that I love. I am sure I need hardly say so now."\r\n\r\n"Hardly, indeed,--considering that you are engaged to Miss Dale."\r\n\r\n"As to that I have, of course, to own that I have behaved\r\nfoolishly;--worse than foolishly, if you choose to say so. You cannot\r\ncondemn me more absolutely than I condemn myself. But I have made\r\nup my mind as to one thing. I will not marry where I do not love."\r\nOh, if Lily could have heard him as he then spoke! "It would be\r\nimpossible for me to speak in terms too high of Miss Dale; but I am\r\nquite sure that I could not make her happy as her husband."\r\n\r\n"Why did you not think of that before you asked her?" said\r\nAlexandrina. But there was very little of condemnation in her tone.\r\n\r\n"I ought to have done so; but it is hardly for you to blame me with\r\nseverity. Had you, when we were last together in London--had you been\r\nless--"\r\n\r\n"Less what?"\r\n\r\n"Less defiant," said Crosbie, "all this might perhaps have been\r\navoided."\r\n\r\nLady Alexandrina could not remember that she had been defiant; but,\r\nhowever, she let that pass. "Oh, yes; of course it was my fault."\r\n\r\n"I went down there to Allington with my heart ill at ease, and now I\r\nhave fallen into this trouble. I tell you all as it has happened. It\r\nis impossible that I should marry Miss Dale. It would be wicked in me\r\nto do so, seeing that my heart belongs altogether to another. I have\r\ntold you who is that other; and now may I hope for an answer?"\r\n\r\n"An answer to what?"\r\n\r\n"Alexandrina, will you be my wife?"\r\n\r\nIf it had been her object to bring him to a point-blank declaration\r\nand proposition of marriage, she had certainly achieved her object\r\nnow. And she had that trust in her own power of management and in her\r\nmother\'s, that she did not fear that in accepting him she would incur\r\nthe risk of being served as he was serving Lily Dale. She knew her\r\nown position and his too well for that. If she accepted him she would\r\nin due course of time become his wife,--let Miss Dale and all her\r\nfriends say what they might to the contrary. As to that head she had\r\nno fear. But nevertheless she did not accept him at once. Though she\r\nwished for the prize, her woman\'s nature hindered her from taking it\r\nwhen it was offered to her.\r\n\r\n"How long is it, Mr. Crosbie," she said, "since you put the same\r\nquestion to Miss Dale?"\r\n\r\n"I have told you everything, Alexandrina,--as I promised that I would\r\ndo. If you intend to punish me for doing so--"\r\n\r\n"And I might ask another question. How long will it be before you put\r\nthe same question to some other girl?"\r\n\r\nHe turned round as though to walk away from her in anger; but when he\r\nhad gone half the distance to the door he returned.\r\n\r\n"By heaven!" he said, and he spoke somewhat roughly, too, "I\'ll have\r\nan answer. You at any rate have nothing with which to reproach me.\r\nAll that I have done wrong, I have done through you, or on your\r\nbehalf. You have heard my proposal. Do you intend to accept it?"\r\n\r\n"I declare you startle me. If you demanded my money or my life, you\r\ncould not be more imperious."\r\n\r\n"Certainly not more resolute in my determination."\r\n\r\n"And if I decline the honour?"\r\n\r\n"I shall think you the most fickle of your sex."\r\n\r\n"And if I were to accept it?"\r\n\r\n"I would swear that you were the best, the dearest, and the sweetest\r\nof women."\r\n\r\n"I would rather have your good opinion than your bad, certainly,"\r\nsaid Lady Alexandrina. And then it was understood by both of them\r\nthat that affair was settled. Whenever she was called on in future to\r\nspeak of Lily, she always called her, "that poor Miss Dale;" but she\r\nnever again spoke a word of reproach to her future lord about that\r\nlittle adventure. "I shall tell mamma, to-night," she said to him, as\r\nshe bade him good-night in some sequestered nook to which they had\r\nbetaken themselves. Lady Julia\'s eye was again on them as they came\r\nout from the sequestered nook, but Alexandrina no longer cared for\r\nLady Julia.\r\n\r\n"George, I cannot quite understand about that Mr. Palliser. Isn\'t\r\nhe to be a duke, and oughtn\'t he to be a lord now?" This question\r\nwas asked by Mrs. George De Courcy of her husband, when they found\r\nthemselves together in the seclusion of the nuptial chamber.\r\n\r\n"Yes; he\'ll be Duke of Omnium when the old fellow dies. I think he\'s\r\none of the slowest fellows I ever came across. He\'ll take deuced good\r\ncare of the property, though."\r\n\r\n"But, George, do explain it to me. It is so stupid not to understand,\r\nand I am afraid of opening my mouth for fear of blundering."\r\n\r\n"Then keep your mouth shut, my dear. You\'ll learn all those sort of\r\nthings in time, and nobody notices it if you don\'t say anything."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but, George;--I don\'t like to sit silent all the night. I\'d\r\nsooner be up here with a novel if I can\'t speak about anything."\r\n\r\n"Look at Lady Dumbello. She doesn\'t want to be always talking."\r\n\r\n"Lady Dumbello is very different from me. But do tell me, who is Mr.\r\nPalliser?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s the duke\'s nephew. If he were the duke\'s son, he would be the\r\nMarquis of Silverbridge."\r\n\r\n"And will he be plain Mister till his uncle dies?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, a very plain Mister."\r\n\r\n"What a pity for him. But, George,--if I have a baby, and if he\r\nshould be a boy, and if--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nonsense; it will be time enough to talk of that when he comes.\r\nI\'m going to sleep."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nA MOTHER-IN-LAW AND A FATHER-IN-LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Mr. Plantagenet Palliser was off upon his\r\npolitical mission before breakfast;--either that, or else some\r\nprivate comfort was afforded to him in guise of solitary rolls and\r\ncoffee. The public breakfast at Courcy Castle was going on at eleven\r\no\'clock, and at that hour Mr. Palliser was already closeted with the\r\nMayor of Silverbridge.\r\n\r\n"I must get off by the 3.45 train," said Mr. Palliser. "Who is there\r\nto speak after me?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I shall say a few words; and Growdy,--he\'ll expect them to\r\nlisten to him. Growdy has always stood very firm by his grace, Mr.\r\nPalliser."\r\n\r\n"Mind we are in the room sharp at one. And you can have a fly, for me\r\nto get away to the station, ready in the yard. I won\'t go a moment\r\nbefore I can help. I shall be just an hour and a half myself. No,\r\nthank you, I never take any wine in the morning." And I may here\r\nstate that Mr. Palliser did get away by the 3.45 train, leaving\r\nMr. Growdy still talking on the platform. Constituents must be\r\ntreated with respect; but time has become so scarce now-a-days that\r\nthat respect has to be meted out by the quarter of an hour with\r\nparsimonious care.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime there was more leisure at Courcy Castle. Neither\r\nthe countess nor Lady Alexandrina came down to breakfast, but their\r\nabsence gave rise to no special remark. Breakfast at the castle was\r\na morning meal at which people showed themselves, or did not show\r\nthemselves, as it pleased them. Lady Julia was there looking very\r\nglum, and Crosbie was sitting next to his future sister-in-law\r\nMargaretta, who already had placed herself on terms of close\r\naffection with him. As he finished his tea she whispered into his\r\near, "Mr. Crosbie, if you could spare half an hour, mamma would so\r\nlike to see you in her own room." Crosbie declared that he would be\r\ndelighted to wait upon her, and did in truth feel some gratitude in\r\nbeing welcomed as a son-in-law into the house. And yet he felt also\r\nthat he was being caught, and that in ascending into the private\r\ndomains of the countess he would be setting the seal upon his own\r\ncaptivity.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he went with a smiling face and a light step, Lady\r\nMargaretta ushering him the way. "Mamma," said she; "I have\r\nbrought Mr. Crosbie up to you. I did not know that you were here,\r\nAlexandrina, or I should have warned him."\r\n\r\nThe countess and her youngest daughter had been breakfasting together\r\nin the elder lady\'s sitting-room, and were now seated in a very\r\ngraceful and well-arranged deshabille. The tea-cups out of which they\r\nhad been drinking were made of some elegant porcelain, the teapot and\r\ncream-jug were of chased silver and as delicate in their way. The\r\nremnant of food consisted of morsels of French roll which had not\r\neven been allowed to crumble themselves in a disorderly fashion,\r\nand of infinitesimal pats of butter. If the morning meal of the two\r\nladies had been as unsubstantial as the appearance of the fragments\r\nindicated, it must be presumed that they intended to lunch early.\r\nThe countess herself was arrayed in an elaborate morning wrapper of\r\nfigured silk, but the simple Alexandrina wore a plain white muslin\r\npeignoir, fastened with pink ribbon. Her hair, which she usually\r\ncarried in long rolls, now hung loose over her shoulders, and\r\ncertainly added something to her stock of female charms. The countess\r\ngot up as Crosbie entered and greeted him with an open hand; but\r\nAlexandrina kept her seat, and merely nodded at him a little welcome.\r\n"I must run down again," said Margaretta, "or I shall have left\r\nAmelia with all the cares of the house upon her."\r\n\r\n"Alexandrina has told me all about it," said the countess, with her\r\nsweetest smile; "and I have given her my approval. I really do think\r\nyou will suit each other very well."\r\n\r\n"I am very much obliged to you," said Crosbie. "I\'m sure at any rate\r\nof this,--that she will suit me very well."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I think she will. She is a good sensible girl."\r\n\r\n"Psha, mamma; pray don\'t go on in that Goody Twoshoes sort of way."\r\n\r\n"So you are, my dear. If you were not it would not be well for you\r\nto do as you are going to do. If you were giddy and harum-scarum,\r\nand devoted to rank and wealth and that sort of thing, it would not\r\nbe well for you to marry a commoner without fortune. I\'m sure Mr.\r\nCrosbie will excuse me for saying so much as that."\r\n\r\n"Of course I know," said Crosbie, "that I had no right to look so\r\nhigh."\r\n\r\n"Well; we\'ll say nothing more about it," said the countess.\r\n\r\n"Pray don\'t," said Alexandrina. "It sounds so like a sermon."\r\n\r\n"Sit down, Mr. Crosbie," said the countess, "and let us have a\r\nlittle conversation. She shall sit by you, if you like it. Nonsense,\r\nAlexandrina,--if he asks it!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, mamma;--I mean to remain where I am."\r\n\r\n"Very well, my dear;--then remain where you are. She is a wilful\r\ngirl, Mr. Crosbie; as you will say when you hear that she has told\r\nme all that you told her last night." Upon hearing this, he changed\r\ncolour a little, but said nothing. "She has told me," continued the\r\ncountess, "about that young lady at Allington. Upon my word, I\'m\r\nafraid you have been very naughty."\r\n\r\n"I have been foolish, Lady De Courcy."\r\n\r\n"Of course; I did not mean anything worse than that. Yes, you have\r\nbeen foolish;--amusing yourself in a thoughtless way, you know, and,\r\nperhaps, a little piqued because a certain lady was not to be won so\r\neasily as your Royal Highness wished. Well, now, all that must be\r\nsettled, you know, as quickly as possible. I don\'t want to ask any\r\nindiscreet questions; but if the young lady has really been left\r\nwith any idea that you meant anything, don\'t you think you should\r\nundeceive her at once?"\r\n\r\n"Of course he will, mamma."\r\n\r\n"Of course you will; and it will be a great comfort to Alexandrina to\r\nknow that the matter is arranged. You hear what Lady Julia is saying\r\nalmost every hour of her life. Now, of course, Alexandrina does not\r\ncare what an old maid like Lady Julia may say; but it will be better\r\nfor all parties that the rumour should be put a stop to. If the earl\r\nwere to hear it, he might, you know--" And the countess shook her\r\nhead, thinking that she could thus best indicate what the earl might\r\ndo, if he were to take it into his head to do anything.\r\n\r\nCrosbie could not bring himself to hold any very confidential\r\nintercourse with the countess about Lily; but he gave a muttered\r\nassurance that he should, as a matter of course, make known the truth\r\nto Miss Dale with as little delay as possible. He could not say\r\nexactly when he would write, nor whether he would write to her or to\r\nher mother; but the thing should be done immediately on his return to\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n"If it will make the matter easier, I will write to Mrs. Dale," said\r\nthe countess. But to this scheme Mr. Crosbie objected very strongly.\r\n\r\nAnd then a few words were said about the earl. "I will tell him this\r\nafternoon," said the countess; "and then you can see him to-morrow\r\nmorning. I don\'t suppose he will say very much, you know; and\r\nperhaps he may think,--you won\'t mind my saying it, I\'m sure,--that\r\nAlexandrina might have done better. But I don\'t believe that\r\nhe\'ll raise any strong objection. There will be something about\r\nsettlements, and that sort of thing, of course." Then the countess\r\nwent away, and Alexandrina was left with her lover for half an hour.\r\nWhen the half-hour was over, he felt that he would have given all\r\nthat he had in the world to have back the last four-and-twenty hours\r\nof his existence. But he had no hope. To jilt Lily Dale would, no\r\ndoubt, be within his power, but he knew that he could not jilt Lady\r\nAlexandrina De Courcy.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning at twelve o\'clock he had his interview with the\r\nfather, and a very unpleasant interview it was. He was ushered into\r\nthe earl\'s room, and found the great peer standing on the rug, with\r\nhis back to the fire, and his hands in his breeches pockets.\r\n\r\n"So you mean to marry my daughter?" said he. "I\'m not very well, as\r\nyou see; I seldom am."\r\n\r\nThese last words were spoken in answer to Crosbie\'s greeting. Crosbie\r\nhad held out his hand to the earl, and had carried his point so far\r\nthat the earl had been forced to take one of his own out of his\r\npocket, and give it to his proposed son-in-law.\r\n\r\n"If your lordship has no objection. I have, at any rate, her\r\npermission to ask for yours."\r\n\r\n"I believe you have not any fortune, have you? She\'s got none; of\r\ncourse you know that?"\r\n\r\n"I have a few thousand pounds, and I believe she has as much."\r\n\r\n"About as much as will buy bread to keep the two of you from\r\nstarving. It\'s nothing to me. You can marry her if you like; only,\r\nlook here, I\'ll have no nonsense. I\'ve had an old woman in with me\r\nthis morning,--one of those that are here in the house,--telling me\r\nsome story about some other girl that you have made a fool of. It\'s\r\nnothing to me how much of that sort of thing you may have done, so\r\nthat you do none of it here. But,--if you play any prank of that kind\r\nwith me, you\'ll find that you\'ve made a mistake."\r\n\r\nCrosbie hardly made any answer to this, but got himself out of the\r\nroom as quickly as he could.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better talk to Gazebee about the trifle of money you\'ve got,"\r\nsaid the earl. Then he dismissed the subject from his mind, and no\r\ndoubt imagined that he had fully done his duty by his daughter.\r\n\r\nOn the day after this, Crosbie was to go. On the last afternoon,\r\nshortly before dinner, he was waylaid by Lady Julia, who had passed\r\nthe day in preparing traps to catch him.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Crosbie," she said, "let me have one word with you. Is this\r\ntrue?"\r\n\r\n"Lady Julia," he said, "I really do not know why you should inquire\r\ninto my private affairs."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, you do know; you know very well. That poor young lady who\r\nhas no father and no brother, is my neighbour, and her friends are\r\nmy friends. She is a friend of my own, and being an old woman, I\r\nhave a right to speak for her. If this is true, Mr. Crosbie, you are\r\ntreating her like a villain."\r\n\r\n"Lady Julia, I really must decline to discuss the matter with you."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell everybody what a villain you are; I will, indeed;--a\r\nvillain and a poor weak silly fool. She was too good for you; that\'s\r\nwhat she was." Crosbie, as Lady Julia was addressing to him the last\r\nwords, hurried upstairs away from her, but her ladyship, standing on\r\na landing-place, spoke up loudly, so that no word should be lost on\r\nher retreating enemy.\r\n\r\n"We positively must get rid of that woman," the countess, who\r\nheard it all, said to Margaretta. "She is disturbing the house and\r\ndisgracing herself every day."\r\n\r\n"She went to papa this morning, mamma."\r\n\r\n"She did not get much by that move," said the countess.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Crosbie returned to town, but just before he\r\nleft the castle he received a third letter from Lily Dale. "I have\r\nbeen rather disappointed at not hearing this morning," said Lily,\r\n"for I thought the postman would have brought me a letter. But I\r\nknow you\'ll be a better boy when you get back to London, and I won\'t\r\nscold you. Scold you, indeed! No; I\'ll never scold you, not though I\r\nshouldn\'t hear for a month."\r\n\r\nHe would have given all that he had in the world, three times told,\r\nif he could have blotted out that visit to Courcy Castle from the\r\npast facts of his existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nADOLPHUS CROSBIE SPENDS AN EVENING AT HIS CLUB.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: (untitled)]\r\n\r\nCrosbie, as he was being driven from the castle to the nearest\r\nstation, in a dog-cart hired from the hotel, could not keep himself\r\nfrom thinking of that other morning, not yet a fortnight past, on\r\nwhich he had left Allington; and as he thought of it he knew that\r\nhe was a villain. On this morning Alexandrina had not come out from\r\nthe house to watch his departure, and catch the last glance of his\r\nreceding figure. As he had not started very early she had sat with\r\nhim at the breakfast-table; but others also had sat there, and when\r\nhe got up to go, she did no more than smile softly and give him her\r\nhand. It had been already settled that he was to spend his Christmas\r\nat Courcy; as it had been also settled that he was to spend it at\r\nAllington.\r\n\r\nLady Amelia was, of all the family, the most affectionate to him, and\r\nperhaps of them all she was the one whose affection was worth the\r\nmost. She was not a woman endowed with a very high mind or with very\r\nnoble feelings. She had begun life trusting to the nobility of her\r\nblood for everything, and declaring somewhat loudly among her friends\r\nthat her father\'s rank and her mother\'s birth imposed on her the duty\r\nof standing closely by her own order. Nevertheless, at the age of\r\nthirty-three she had married her father\'s man of business, under\r\ncircumstances which were not altogether creditable to her. But she\r\nhad done her duty in her new sphere of life with some constancy and a\r\nfixed purpose; and now that her sister was going to marry, as she had\r\ndone, a man much below herself in social standing, she was prepared\r\nto do her duty as a sister and a sister-in-law.\r\n\r\n"We shall be up in town in November, and of course you\'ll come to\r\nus at once. Albert Villa, you know, in Hamilton Terrace, St. John\'s\r\nWood. We dine at seven, and on Sundays at two; and you\'ll always find\r\na place. Mind you come to us, and make yourself quite at home. I do\r\nso hope you and Mortimer will get on well together."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure we shall," said Crosbie. But he had had higher hopes in\r\nmarrying into this noble family than that of becoming intimate with\r\nMortimer Gazebee. What those hopes were he could hardly define to\r\nhimself now that he had brought himself so near to the fruition of\r\nthem. Lady De Courcy had certainly promised to write to her first\r\ncousin who was Under-Secretary of State for India, with reference to\r\nthat secretaryship at the General Committee Office; but Crosbie, when\r\nhe came to weigh in his mind what good might result to him from this,\r\nwas disposed to think that his chance of obtaining the promotion\r\nwould be quite as good without the interest of the Under-Secretary of\r\nState for India as with it. Now that he belonged, as we may say, to\r\nthis noble family, he could hardly discern what were the advantages\r\nwhich he had expected from this alliance. He had said to himself that\r\nit would be much to have a countess for a mother-in-law; but now,\r\neven already, although the possession to which he had looked was not\r\nyet garnered, he was beginning to tell himself that the thing was not\r\nworth possessing.\r\n\r\nAs he sat in the train, with a newspaper in his hand, he went on\r\nacknowledging to himself that he was a villain. Lady Julia had spoken\r\nthe truth to him on the stairs at Courcy, and so he confessed over\r\nand over again. But he was chiefly angry with himself for this,--that\r\nhe had been a villain without gaining anything by his villany; that\r\nhe had been a villain, and was to lose so much by his villany. He\r\nmade comparison between Lily and Alexandrina, and owned to himself,\r\nover and over again, that Lily would make the best wife that a man\r\ncould take to his bosom. As to Alexandrina, he knew the thinness of\r\nher character. She would stick by him, no doubt; and in a circuitous,\r\ndiscontented, unhappy way, would probably be true to her duties as\r\na wife and mother. She would be nearly such another as Lady Amelia\r\nGazebee. But was that a prize sufficiently rich to make him contented\r\nwith his own prowess and skill in winning it? And was that a prize\r\nsufficiently rich to justify him to himself for his terrible villany?\r\nLily Dale he had loved; and he now declared to himself that he could\r\nhave continued to love her through his whole life. But what was there\r\nfor any man to love in Alexandrina De Courcy?\r\n\r\nWhile resolving, during his first four or five days at the castle,\r\nthat he would throw Lily Dale overboard, he had contrived to quiet\r\nhis conscience by inward allusions to sundry heroes of romance. He\r\nhad thought of Lothario, Don Juan, and of Lovelace; and had told\r\nhimself that the world had ever been full of such heroes. And the\r\nworld, too, had treated such heroes well; not punishing them at all\r\nas villains, but caressing them rather, and calling them curled\r\ndarlings. Why should not he be a curled darling as well as another?\r\nLadies had ever been fond of the Don Juan character, and Don Juan had\r\ngenerally been popular with men also. And then he named to himself a\r\ndozen modern Lotharios,--men who were holding their heads well above\r\nwater, although it was known that they had played this lady false,\r\nand brought that other one to death\'s door, or perhaps even to death\r\nitself. War and love were alike, and the world was prepared to\r\nforgive any guile to militants in either camp.\r\n\r\nBut now that he had done the deed he found himself forced to look\r\nat it from quite another point of view. Suddenly that character of\r\nLothario showed itself to him in a different light, and one in which\r\nit did not please him to look at it as belonging to himself. He began\r\nto feel that it would be almost impossible for him to write that\r\nletter to Lily, which it was absolutely necessary that he should\r\nwrite. He was in a position in which his mind would almost turn\r\nitself to thoughts of self-destruction as the only means of escape. A\r\nfortnight ago he was a happy man, having everything before him that a\r\nman ought to want; and now--now that he was the accepted son-in-law\r\nof an earl, and the confident expectant of high promotion--he was the\r\nmost miserable, degraded wretch in the world!\r\n\r\nHe changed his clothes at his lodgings in Mount Street and went down\r\nto his club to dinner. He could, at any rate, do nothing that night.\r\nHis letter to Allington must, no doubt, be written at once; but, as\r\nhe could not send it before the next night\'s post, he was not forced\r\nto set to work upon it that evening. As he walked along Piccadilly\r\non his way to St. James\'s Square, it occurred to him that it might\r\nbe well to write a short line to Lily, telling her nothing of the\r\ntruth,--a note written as though his engagement with her was still\r\nunbroken, but yet written with care, saying nothing about that\r\nengagement, so as to give him a little time. Then he thought that he\r\nwould telegraph to Bernard and tell everything to him. Bernard would,\r\nof course, be prepared to avenge his cousin in some way, but for such\r\nvengeance Crosbie felt that he should care little. Lady Julia had\r\ntold him that Lily was without father or brother, thereby accusing\r\nhim of the basest cowardice. "I wish she had a dozen brothers," he\r\nsaid to himself. But he hardly knew why he expressed such a wish.\r\n\r\nHe returned to London on the last day of October, and he found the\r\nstreets at the West End nearly deserted. He thought, therefore, that\r\nhe should be quite alone at his club, but as he entered the dinner\r\nroom he saw one of his oldest and most intimate friends standing\r\nbefore the fire. Fowler Pratt was the man who had first brought him\r\ninto Sebright\'s, and had given him almost his earliest start on his\r\nsuccessful career in life. Since that time he and his friend Fowler\r\nPratt had lived in close communion, though Pratt had always held a\r\ncertain ascendancy in their friendship. He was in age a few years\r\nsenior to Crosbie, and was in truth a man of better parts. But he\r\nwas less ambitious, less desirous of shining in the world, and much\r\nless popular with men in general. He was possessed of a moderate\r\nprivate fortune on which he lived in a quiet, modest manner, and was\r\nunmarried, not likely to marry, inoffensive, useless, and prudent.\r\nFor the first few years of Crosbie\'s life in London he had lived very\r\nmuch with his friend Pratt, and had been accustomed to depend much\r\non his friend\'s counsel; but latterly, since he had himself become\r\nsomewhat noticeable, he had found more pleasure in the society of\r\nsuch men as Dale, who were not his superiors either in age or wisdom.\r\nBut there had been no coolness between him and Pratt, and now they\r\nmet with perfect cordiality.\r\n\r\n"I thought you were down in Barsetshire," said Pratt.\r\n\r\n"And I thought you were in Switzerland."\r\n\r\n"I have been in Switzerland," said Pratt.\r\n\r\n"And I have been in Barsetshire," said Crosbie. Then they ordered\r\ntheir dinner together.\r\n\r\n"And so you\'re going to be married?" said Pratt, when the waiter had\r\ncarried away the cheese.\r\n\r\n"Who told you that?"\r\n\r\n"Well, but you are? Never mind who told me, if I was told the truth."\r\n\r\n"But if it be not true?"\r\n\r\n"I have heard it for the last month," said Pratt, "and it has been\r\nspoken of as a thing certain; and it is true; is it not?"\r\n\r\n"I believe it is," said Crosbie, slowly.\r\n\r\n"Why, what on earth is the matter with you, that you speak of it in\r\nthat way? Am I to congratulate you, or am I not? The lady, I\'m told,\r\nis a cousin of Dale\'s."\r\n\r\nCrosbie had turned his chair from the table round to the fire, and\r\nsaid nothing in answer to this. He sat with his glass of sherry in\r\nhis hand, looking at the coals, and thinking whether it would not be\r\nwell that he should tell the whole story to Pratt. No one could give\r\nhim better advice; and no one, as far as he knew his friend, would\r\nbe less shocked at the telling of such a story. Pratt had no romance\r\nabout women, and had never pretended to very high sentiments.\r\n\r\n"Come up into the smoking-room and I\'ll tell you all about it," said\r\nCrosbie. So they went off together, and, as the smoking-room was\r\nuntenanted, Crosbie was able to tell his story.\r\n\r\nHe found it very hard to tell;--much harder than he had beforehand\r\nfancied. "I have got into terrible trouble," he began by saying. Then\r\nhe told how he had fallen suddenly in love with Lily, how he had been\r\nrash and imprudent, how nice she was--"infinitely too good for such a\r\nman as I am," he said;--how she had accepted him, and then how he had\r\nrepented. "I should have told you beforehand," he then said, "that I\r\nwas already half engaged to Lady Alexandrina De Courcy." The reader,\r\nhowever, will understand that this half-engagement was a fiction.\r\n\r\n"And now you mean that you are altogether engaged to her?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly so."\r\n\r\n"And that Miss Dale must be told that, on second thoughts, you have\r\nchanged your mind?"\r\n\r\n"I know that I have behaved very badly," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"Indeed you have," said his friend.\r\n\r\n"It is one of those troubles in which a man finds himself involved\r\nalmost before he knows where he is."\r\n\r\n"Well; I can\'t look at it exactly in that light. A man may amuse\r\nhimself with a girl, and I can understand his disappointing her and\r\nnot offering to marry her,--though even that sort of thing isn\'t much\r\nto my taste. But, by George, to make an offer of marriage to such\r\na girl as that in September, to live for a month in her family as\r\nher affianced husband, and then coolly go away to another house in\r\nOctober, and make an offer to another girl of higher rank--"\r\n\r\n"You know very well that that has had nothing to do with it."\r\n\r\n"It looks very like it. And how are you going to communicate these\r\ntidings to Miss Dale?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Crosbie, who was beginning to be very sore.\r\n\r\n"And you have quite made up your mind that you\'ll stick to the earl\'s\r\ndaughter?"\r\n\r\nThe idea of jilting Alexandrina instead of Lily had never as yet\r\npresented itself to Crosbie, and now, as he thought of it, he could\r\nnot perceive that it was feasible.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, "I shall marry Lady Alexandrina;--that is, if I do\r\nnot cut the whole concern, and my own throat into the bargain."\r\n\r\n"If I were in your shoes I think I should cut the whole concern. I\r\ncould not stand it. What do you mean to say to Miss Dale\'s uncle?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care a ---- for Miss Dale\'s uncle," said Crosbie. "If he\r\nwere to walk in at that door this moment, I would tell him the whole\r\nstory, without--"\r\n\r\nAs he was yet speaking, one of the club servants opened the door of\r\nthe smoking-room, and seeing Crosbie seated in a lounging-chair near\r\nthe fire, went up to him with a gentleman\'s card. Crosbie took the\r\ncard and read the name. "Mr. Dale, Allington."\r\n\r\n"The gentleman is in the waiting-room," said the servant.\r\n\r\nCrosbie for the moment was struck dumb. He had declared that very\r\nmoment that he should feel no personal disinclination to meet Mr.\r\nDale, and now that gentleman was within the walls of the club,\r\nwaiting to see him!\r\n\r\n"Who\'s that?" asked Pratt. And then Crosbie handed him the card.\r\n"Whew-w-w-hew," whistled Pratt.\r\n\r\n"Did you tell the gentleman I was here?" asked Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"I said I thought you were upstairs, sir."\r\n\r\n"That will do," said Pratt. "The gentleman will no doubt wait for a\r\nminute." And then the servant went out of the room. "Now, Crosbie,\r\nyou must make up your mind. By one of these women and all her friends\r\nyou will ever be regarded as a rascal, and they of course will look\r\nout to punish you with such punishment as may come to their hands.\r\nYou must now choose which shall be the sufferer."\r\n\r\nThe man was a coward at heart. The reflection that he might, even\r\nnow, at this moment, meet the old squire on pleasant terms,--or at\r\nany rate not on terms of defiance, pleaded more strongly in Lily\'s\r\nfavour than had any other argument since Crosbie had first made up\r\nhis mind to abandon her. He did not fear personal ill-usage;--he was\r\nnot afraid lest he should be kicked or beaten; but he did not dare to\r\nface the just anger of the angry man.\r\n\r\n"If I were you," said Pratt, "I would not go down to that man at the\r\npresent moment for a trifle."\r\n\r\n"But what can I do?"\r\n\r\n"Shirk away out of the club. Only if you do that it seems to me that\r\nyou\'ll have to go on shirking for the rest of your life."\r\n\r\n"Pratt, I must say that I expected something more like friendship\r\nfrom you."\r\n\r\n"What can I do for you? There are positions in which it is impossible\r\nto help a man. I tell you plainly that you have behaved very badly. I\r\ndo not see that I can help you."\r\n\r\n"Would you see him?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not, if I am to be expected to take your part."\r\n\r\n"Take any part you like,--only tell him the truth."\r\n\r\n"And what is the truth?"\r\n\r\n"I was part engaged to that other girl before; and then, when I came\r\nto think of it, I knew that I was not fit to marry Miss Dale. I know\r\nI have behaved badly; but, Pratt, thousands have done the same thing\r\nbefore."\r\n\r\n"I can only say that I have not been so unfortunate as to reckon any\r\nof those thousands among my friends."\r\n\r\n"You mean to tell me, then, that you are going to turn your back on\r\nme?" said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t said anything of the kind. I certainly won\'t undertake to\r\ndefend you, for I don\'t see that your conduct admits of defence. I\r\nwill see this gentleman if you wish it, and tell him anything that\r\nyou may desire me to tell him."\r\n\r\nAt this moment the servant returned with a note for Crosbie. Mr. Dale\r\nhad called for paper and envelope, and sent up to him the following\r\nmissive:--"Do you intend to come down to me? I know that you are in\r\nthe house." "For heaven\'s sake go to him," said Crosbie. "He is well\r\naware that I was deceived about his niece,--that I thought he was\r\nto give her some fortune. He knows all about that, and that when I\r\nlearned from him that she was to have nothing--"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, Crosbie, I wish you could find another messenger."\r\n\r\n"Ah! you do not understand," said Crosbie in his agony. "You think\r\nthat I am inventing this plea about her fortune now. It isn\'t so. He\r\nwill understand. We have talked all this over before, and he knew\r\nhow terribly I was disappointed. Shall I wait for you here, or will\r\nyou come to my lodgings? Or I will go down to the Beaufort, and will\r\nwait for you there." And it was finally arranged that he should get\r\nhimself out of this club and wait at the other for Pratt\'s report of\r\nthe interview.\r\n\r\n"Do you go down first," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"Yes: I had better," said Pratt. "Otherwise you may be seen. Mr. Dale\r\nwould have his eye upon you, and there would be a row in the house."\r\nThere was a smile of sarcasm on Pratt\'s face as he spoke which\r\nangered Crosbie even in his misery, and made him long to tell his\r\nfriend that he would not trouble him with this mission,--that he\r\nwould manage his own affairs himself; but he was weakened and\r\nmentally humiliated by the sense of his own rascality, and had\r\nalready lost the power of asserting himself, and of maintaining his\r\nascendancy. He was beginning to recognize the fact that he had done\r\nthat for which he must endure to be kicked, to be kicked morally if\r\nnot materially; and that it was no longer possible for him to hold\r\nhis head up without shame.\r\n\r\nPratt took Mr. Dale\'s note in his hand and went down into the\r\nstranger\'s room. There he found the squire standing, so that he could\r\nsee through the open door of the room to the foot of the stairs down\r\nwhich Crosbie must descend before he could leave the club. As a\r\nmeasure of first precaution the ambassador closed the door; then he\r\nbowed to Mr. Dale, and asked him if he would take a chair.\r\n\r\n"I wanted to see Mr. Crosbie," said the squire.\r\n\r\n"I have your note to that gentleman in my hand," said he. "He has\r\nthought it better that you should have this interview with me;--and\r\nunder all the circumstances perhaps it is better."\r\n\r\n"Is he such a coward that he dare not see me?"\r\n\r\n"There are some actions, Mr. Dale, that will make a coward of any\r\nman. My friend Crosbie is, I take it, brave enough in the ordinary\r\nsense of the word, but he has injured you."\r\n\r\n"It is all true, then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Dale; I fear it is all true."\r\n\r\n"And you call that man your friend! Mr.--; I don\'t know what your\r\nname is."\r\n\r\n"Pratt;--Fowler Pratt. I have known Crosbie for fourteen years,--ever\r\nsince he was a boy; and it is not my way, Mr. Dale, to throw over an\r\nold friend under any circumstances."\r\n\r\n"Not if he committed a murder."\r\n\r\n"No; not though he committed a murder."\r\n\r\n"If what I hear is true, this man is worse than a murderer."\r\n\r\n"Of course, Mr. Dale, I cannot know what you have heard. I believe\r\nthat Mr. Crosbie has behaved very badly to your niece, Miss Dale; I\r\nbelieve that he was engaged to marry her, or, at any rate, that some\r\nsuch proposition had been made."\r\n\r\n"Proposition! Why, sir, it was a thing so completely understood that\r\neverybody knew it in the county. It was so positively fixed that\r\nthere was no secret about it. Upon my honour, Mr. Pratt, I can\'t as\r\nyet understand it. If I remember right, it\'s not a fortnight since\r\nhe left my house at Allington,--not a fortnight. And that poor girl\r\nwas with him on the morning of his going as his betrothed bride.\r\nNot a fortnight since! And now I\'ve had a letter from an old family\r\nfriend telling me that he is going to marry one of Lord De Courcy\'s\r\ndaughters! I went instantly off to Courcy, and found that he had\r\nstarted for London. Now, I have followed him here; and you tell me\r\nit\'s all true."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid it is, Mr. Dale; too true."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand it; I don\'t, indeed. I cannot bring myself to\r\nbelieve that the man who was sitting the other day at my table should\r\nbe so great a scoundrel. Did he mean it all the time that he was\r\nthere?"\r\n\r\n"No; certainly not. Lady Alexandrina De Courcy was, I believe, an old\r\nfriend of his;--with whom, perhaps, he had had some lover\'s quarrel.\r\nOn his going to Courcy they made it up; and this is the result."\r\n\r\n"And that is to be sufficient for my poor girl?"\r\n\r\n"You will, of course, understand that I am not defending Mr. Crosbie.\r\nThe whole affair is very sad,--very sad, indeed. I can only say, in\r\nhis excuse, that he is not the first man who has behaved badly to a\r\nlady."\r\n\r\n"And that is his message to me, is it? And that is what I am to tell\r\nmy niece? You have been deceived by a scoundrel. But what then? You\r\nare not the first! Mr. Pratt, I give you my word as a gentleman, I do\r\nnot understand it. I have lived a good deal out of the world, and am,\r\ntherefore, perhaps, more astonished than I ought to be."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Dale, I feel for you--"\r\n\r\n"Feel for me! What is to become of my girl? And do you suppose that\r\nI will let this other marriage go on; that I will not tell the\r\nDe Courcys, and all the world at large, what sort of a man this\r\nis;--that I will not get at him to punish him? Does he think that I\r\nwill put up with this?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know what he thinks; I must only beg that you will not mix\r\nme up in the matter--as though I were a participator in his offence."\r\n\r\n"Will you tell him from me that I desire to see him?"\r\n\r\n"I do not think that that would do any good."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, sir; you have brought me his message; will you have the\r\ngoodness now to take back mine to him?"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean at once--this evening,--now?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, at once--this evening,--now;--this minute."\r\n\r\n"Ah; he has left the club; he is not here now; he went when I came to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Then he is a coward as well as a scoundrel." In answer to which\r\nassertion, Mr. Fowler Pratt merely shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"He is a coward as well as a scoundrel. Will you have the kindness to\r\ntell your friend from me that he is a coward and a scoundrel,--and a\r\nliar, sir."\r\n\r\n"If it be so, Miss Dale is well quit of her engagement."\r\n\r\n"That is your consolation, is it? That may be all very well\r\nnow-a-days; but when I was a young man, I would sooner have burnt out\r\nmy tongue than have spoken in such a way on such a subject. I would,\r\nindeed. Good-night, Mr. Pratt. Pray make your friend understand that\r\nhe has not yet seen the last of the Dales; although, as you hint, the\r\nladies of that family will no doubt have learned that he is not fit\r\nto associate with them." Then, taking up his hat, the squire made his\r\nway out of the club.\r\n\r\n"I would not have done it," said Pratt to himself, "for all the\r\nbeauty, and all the wealth, and all the rank that ever were owned by\r\na woman."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nLORD DE COURCY IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Julia De Guest had not during her life written many letters to\r\nMr. Dale of Allington, nor had she ever been very fond of him. But\r\nwhen she felt certain how things were going at Courcy, or rather, as\r\nwe may say, how they had already gone, she took pen in hand, and sat\r\nherself to work, doing, as she conceived, her duty by her neighbour.\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MR. DALE [she said],\r\n\r\n   I believe I need make no secret of having known that your\r\n   niece Lilian is engaged to Mr. Crosbie, of London. I think\r\n   it proper to warn you that if this be true Mr. Crosbie is\r\n   behaving himself in a very improper manner here. I am not\r\n   a person who concerns myself much in the affairs of other\r\n   people; and under ordinary circumstances, the conduct of\r\n   Mr. Crosbie would be nothing to me,--or, indeed, less\r\n   than nothing; but I do to you as I would wish that others\r\n   should do unto me. I believe it is only too true that\r\n   Mr. Crosbie has proposed to Lady Alexandrina De Courcy,\r\n   and been accepted by her. I think you will believe that\r\n   I would not say this without warrant, and if there be\r\n   anything in it, it may be well, for the poor young lady\'s\r\n   sake, that you should put yourself in the way of learning\r\n   the truth.\r\n\r\n   Believe me to be yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n   JULIA DE GUEST.\r\n\r\n   Courcy Castle, Thursday.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe squire had never been very fond of any of the De Guest family,\r\nand had, perhaps, liked Lady Julia the least of them all. He was wont\r\nto call her a meddling old woman,--remembering her bitterness and\r\npride in those now long bygone days in which the gallant major had\r\nrun off with Lady Fanny. When he first received this letter, he did\r\nnot, on the first reading of it, believe a word of its contents.\r\n"Cross-grained old harridan," he said out loud to his nephew. "Look\r\nwhat that aunt of yours has written to me." Bernard read the letter\r\ntwice, and as he did so his face became hard and angry.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say you believe it?" said the squire.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it will be safe to disregard it."\r\n\r\n"What! you think it possible that your friend is doing as she says?"\r\n\r\n"It is certainly possible. He was angry when he found that Lily had\r\nno fortune."\r\n\r\n"Heavens, Bernard! And you can speak of it in that way?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say that it is true; but I think we should look to it. I\r\nwill go to Courcy Castle and learn the truth."\r\n\r\nThe squire at last decided that he would go. He went to Courcy\r\nCastle, and found that Crosbie had started two hours before his\r\narrival. He asked for Lady Julia, and learned from her that Crosbie\r\nhad actually left the house as the betrothed husband of Lady\r\nAlexandrina.\r\n\r\n"The countess, I am sure, will not contradict it, if you will see\r\nher," said Lady Julia. But this the squire was unwilling to do. He\r\nwould not proclaim the wretched condition of his niece more loudly\r\nthan was necessary, and therefore he started on his pursuit of\r\nCrosbie. What was his success on that evening we have already\r\nlearned.\r\n\r\nBoth Lady Alexandrina and her mother heard of Mr. Dale\'s arrival at\r\nthe castle, but nothing was said between them on the subject. Lady\r\nAmelia Gazebee heard of it also, and she ventured to discuss the\r\nmatter with her sister.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know exactly how far it went, do you?"\r\n\r\n"No; yes;--not exactly, that is," said Alexandrina.\r\n\r\n"I suppose he did say something about marriage to the girl?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m afraid he did."\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear! It\'s very unfortunate. What sort of people are those\r\nDales? I suppose he talked to you about them."\r\n\r\n"No, he didn\'t; not very much. I daresay she is an artful, sly thing!\r\nIt\'s a great pity men should go on in such a way."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is," said Lady Amelia. "And I do suppose that in this case\r\nthe blame has been more with him than with her. It\'s only right I\r\nshould tell you that."\r\n\r\n"But what can I do?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t say you can do anything; but it\'s as well you should know."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t know, and you don\'t know; and I can\'t see that there is\r\nany use talking about it now. I knew him a long while before she did,\r\nand if she has allowed him to make a fool of her, it isn\'t my fault."\r\n\r\n"Nobody says it is, my dear."\r\n\r\n"But you seem to preach to me about it. What can I do for the girl?\r\nThe fact is, he don\'t care for her a bit, and never did."\r\n\r\n"Then he shouldn\'t have told her that he did."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very well, Amelia; but people don\'t always do exactly all\r\nthat they ought to do. I suppose Mr. Crosbie isn\'t the first man that\r\nhas proposed to two ladies. I dare say it was wrong, but I can\'t help\r\nit. As to Mr. Dale coming here with a tale of his niece\'s wrongs, I\r\nthink it very absurd,--very absurd indeed. It makes it look as though\r\nthere had been a scheme to catch Mr. Crosbie, and it\'s my belief that\r\nthere was such a scheme."\r\n\r\n"I only hope that there\'ll be no quarrel."\r\n\r\n"Men don\'t fight duels now-a-days, Amelia."\r\n\r\n"But do you remember what Frank Gresham did to Mr. Moffat when he\r\nbehaved so badly to poor Augusta?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Crosbie isn\'t afraid of that kind of thing. And I always thought\r\nthat Frank was very wrong,--very wrong indeed. What\'s the good of two\r\nmen beating each other in the street?"\r\n\r\n"Well; I\'m sure I hope there\'ll be no quarrel. But I own I don\'t like\r\nthe look of it. You see the uncle must have known all about it, and\r\nhave consented to the marriage, or he would not have come here."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that it can make any difference to me, Amelia."\r\n\r\n"No, my dear, I don\'t see that it can. We shall be up in town soon,\r\nand I will see as much as possible of Mr. Crosbie. The marriage, I\r\nhope, will take place soon."\r\n\r\n"He talks of February."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t put it off, Alley, whatever you do. There are so many slips,\r\nyou know, in these things."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not a bit afraid of that," said Alexandrina, sticking up her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n"I daresay not; and you may be sure that we will keep an eye on him.\r\nMortimer will get him up to dine with us as often as possible, and as\r\nhis leave of absence is all over, he can\'t get out of town. He\'s to\r\nbe here at Christmas, isn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Of course he is."\r\n\r\n"Mind you keep him to that. And as to these Dales, I would be very\r\ncareful, if I were you, not to say anything unkind of them to any\r\none. It sounds badly in your position." And with this last piece of\r\nadvice Lady Amelia Gazebee allowed the subject to drop.\r\n\r\nOn that day Lady Julia returned to her own home. Her adieux to the\r\nwhole family at Courcy Castle were very cold, but about Mr. Crosbie\r\nand his lady-love at Allington she said no further word to any of\r\nthem. Alexandrina did not show herself at all on the occasion, and\r\nindeed had not spoken to her enemy since that evening on which she\r\nhad felt herself constrained to retreat from the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n"Good-by," said the countess. "You have been so good to come, and we\r\nhave enjoyed it so much."\r\n\r\n"I thank you very much. Good morning," said Lady Julia, with a\r\nstately courtesy.\r\n\r\n"Pray remember me to your brother. I wish we could have seen him; I\r\nhope he has not been hurt by the--the bull." And then Lady Julia went\r\nher way.\r\n\r\n"What a fool I have been to have that woman in the house," said the\r\ncountess, before the door was closed behind her guest\'s back.\r\n\r\n"Indeed you have," said Lady Julia, screaming back through the\r\npassage. Then there was a long silence, then a suppressed titter, and\r\nafter that a loud laugh.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma, what shall we do?" said Lady Amelia.\r\n\r\n"Do!" said Margaretta; "why should we do anything? She has heard the\r\ntruth for once in her life."\r\n\r\n"Dear Lady Dumbello, what will you think of us?" said the countess,\r\nturning round to another guest, who was also just about to depart.\r\n"Did any one ever know such a woman before?"\r\n\r\n"I think she\'s very nice," said Lady Dumbello, smiling.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t quite agree with you there," said Lady Clandidlem. "But I\r\ndo believe she means to do her best. She is very charitable, and all\r\nthat sort of thing."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I don\'t know," said Rosina. "I asked her for a subscription\r\nto the mission for putting down the Papists in the west of Ireland,\r\nand she refused me point-blank."\r\n\r\n"Now, my dear, if you\'re quite ready," said Lord Dumbello, coming\r\ninto the room. Then there was another departure; but on this occasion\r\nthe countess waited till the doors were shut, and the retreating\r\nfootsteps were no longer heard. "Have you observed," said she to Lady\r\nClandidlem, "that she has not held her head up since Mr. Palliser\r\nwent away?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I have," said Lady Clandidlem. "As for poor Dumbello, he\'s\r\nthe blindest creature I ever saw in my life."\r\n\r\n"We shall hear of something before next May," said Lady De Courcy,\r\nshaking her head; "but for all that she\'ll never be Duchess of\r\nOmnium."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what your mamma will say of me when I go away to-morrow,"\r\nsaid Lady Clandidlem to Margaretta, as they walked across the hall\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n"She won\'t say that you are going to run away with any gentleman,"\r\nsaid Margaretta.\r\n\r\n"At any rate not with the earl," said Lady Clandidlem. "Ha, ha, ha!\r\nWell, we are all very good-natured, are we not? The best is that it\r\nmeans nothing."\r\n\r\nThus by degrees all the guests went, and the family of the De Courcys\r\nwas left to the bliss of their own domestic circle. This, we may\r\npresume, was not without its charms, seeing that there were so many\r\nfeelings in common between the mother and her children. There were\r\ndrawbacks to it, no doubt, arising perhaps chiefly from the earl\'s\r\nbodily infirmities. "When your father speaks to me," said Mrs. George\r\nto her husband, "he puts me in such a shiver that I cannot open my\r\nmouth to answer him."\r\n\r\n"You should stand up to him," said George. "He can\'t hurt you, you\r\nknow. Your money\'s your own; and if I\'m ever to be the heir, it won\'t\r\nbe by his doing."\r\n\r\n"But he gnashes his teeth at me."\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t care for that, if he don\'t bite. He used to gnash them\r\nat me; and when I had to ask him for money I didn\'t like it; but now\r\nI don\'t mind him a bit. He threw the peerage at me one day, but it\r\ndidn\'t go within a yard of my head."\r\n\r\n"If he throws anything at me, George, I shall drop upon the spot."\r\n\r\nBut the countess had a worse time with the earl than any of her\r\nchildren. It was necessary that she should see him daily, and\r\nnecessary also that she should say much that he did not like to hear,\r\nand make many petitions that caused him to gnash his teeth. The earl\r\nwas one of those men who could not endure to live otherwise than\r\nexpensively, and yet was made miserable by every recurring expense.\r\nHe ought to have known by this time that butchers, and bakers, and\r\ncorn-chandlers, and coal-merchants will not supply their goods for\r\nnothing; and yet it always seemed as though he had expected that at\r\nthis special period they would do so. He was an embarrassed man, no\r\ndoubt, and had not been fortunate in his speculations at Newmarket\r\nor Homburg; but, nevertheless, he had still the means of living\r\nwithout daily torment; and it must be supposed that his self-imposed\r\nsufferings, with regard to money, rose rather from his disposition\r\nthan his necessities. His wife never knew whether he were really\r\nruined, or simply pretending it. She had now become so used\r\nto her position in this respect, that she did not allow fiscal\r\nconsiderations to mar her happiness. Food and clothing had\r\nalways come to her,--including velvet gowns, new trinkets, and a\r\nman-cook,--and she presumed that they would continue to come. But\r\nthat daily conference with her husband was almost too much for her.\r\nShe struggled to avoid it; and, as far as the ways and means were\r\nconcerned, would have allowed them to arrange themselves, if he would\r\nonly have permitted it. But he insisted on seeing her daily in his\r\nown sitting-room; and she had acknowledged to her favourite daughter,\r\nMargaretta, that those half-hours would soon be the death of her. "I\r\nsometimes feel," she said, "that I am going mad before I can get\r\nout." And she reproached herself, probably without reason, in that\r\nshe had brought much of this upon herself. In former days the earl\r\nhad been constantly away from home, and the countess had complained.\r\nLike many other women she had not known when she was well off. She\r\nhad complained, urging upon her lord that he should devote more\r\nof his time to his own hearth. It is probable that her ladyship\'s\r\nremonstrances had been less efficacious than the state of his own\r\nhealth in producing that domestic constancy which he now practised;\r\nbut it is certain that she looked back with bitter regret to the\r\nhappy days when she was deserted, jealous, and querulous. "Don\'t\r\nyou wish we could get Sir Omicron to order him to the German Spas?"\r\nshe had said to Margaretta. Now Sir Omicron was the great London\r\nphysician, and might, no doubt, do much in that way.\r\n\r\nBut no such happy order had as yet been given; and, as far as the\r\nfamily could foresee, paterfamilias intended to pass the winter with\r\nthem at Courcy. The guests, as I have said, were all gone, and none\r\nbut the family were in the house when her ladyship waited upon her\r\nlord one morning at twelve o\'clock, a few days after Mr. Dale\'s visit\r\nto the castle. He always breakfasted alone, and after breakfast found\r\nin a French novel and a cigar what solace those innocent recreations\r\nwere still able to afford him. When the novel no longer excited him\r\nand when he was saturated with smoke, he would send for his wife.\r\nAfter that, his valet would dress him. "She gets it worse than I do,"\r\nthe man declared in the servants\' hall; "and minds it a deal more. I\r\ncan give warning, and she can\'t."\r\n\r\n"Better? No, I ain\'t better," the husband said, in answer to his\r\nwife\'s inquiries. "I never shall be better while you keep that cook\r\nin the kitchen."\r\n\r\n"But where are we to get another if we send him away?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s not my business to find cooks. I don\'t know where you\'re to\r\nget one. It\'s my belief you won\'t have a cook at all before long. It\r\nseems you have got two extra men into the house without telling me."\r\n\r\n"We must have servants, you know, when there is company. It wouldn\'t\r\ndo to have Lady Dumbello here, and no one to wait on her."\r\n\r\n"Who asked Lady Dumbello? I didn\'t."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure, my dear, you liked having her here."\r\n\r\n"D---- Lady Dumbello!" and then there was a pause. The countess had\r\nno objection whatsoever to the above proposition, and was rejoiced\r\nthat that question of the servants was allowed to slip aside, through\r\nthe aid of her ladyship.\r\n\r\n"Look at that letter from Porlock," said the earl; and he pushed\r\nover to the unhappy mother a letter from her eldest son. Of all her\r\nchildren he was the one she loved the best; but him she was never\r\nallowed to see under her own roof. "I sometimes think that he is the\r\ngreatest rascal with whom I ever had occasion to concern myself,"\r\nsaid the earl.\r\n\r\nShe took the letter and read it. The epistle was certainly not one\r\nwhich a father could receive with pleasure from his son; but the\r\ndisagreeable nature of its contents was the fault rather of the\r\nparent than of the child. The writer intimated that certain money due\r\nto him had not been paid with necessary punctuality, and that unless\r\nhe received it, he should instruct his lawyer to take some authorized\r\nlegal proceedings. Lord De Courcy had raised certain moneys on\r\nthe family property, which he could not have raised without the\r\nco-operation of his heir, and had bound himself, in return for that\r\nco-operation, to pay a certain fixed income to his eldest son. This\r\nhe regarded as an allowance from himself; but Lord Porlock regarded\r\nit as his own, by lawful claim. The son had not worded his letter\r\nwith any affectionate phraseology. "Lord Porlock begs to inform Lord\r\nDe Courcy--" Such had been the commencement.\r\n\r\n"I suppose he must have his money; else how can he live?" said the\r\ncountess, trembling.\r\n\r\n"Live!" shouted the earl. "And so you think it proper that he should\r\nwrite such a letter as that to his father!"\r\n\r\n"It is all very unfortunate," she replied.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know where the money\'s to come from. As for him, if he were\r\nstarving, it would serve him right. He\'s a disgrace to the name and\r\nthe family. From all I hear, he won\'t live long."\r\n\r\n"Oh, De Courcy, don\'t talk of it in that way!"\r\n\r\n"What way am I to talk of it? If I say that he\'s my greatest comfort,\r\nand living as becomes a nobleman, and is a fine healthy man of his\r\nage, with a good wife and a lot of legitimate children, will that\r\nmake you believe it? Women are such fools. Nothing that I say will\r\nmake him worse than he is."\r\n\r\n"But he may reform."\r\n\r\n"Reform! He\'s over forty, and when I last saw him he looked nearly\r\nsixty. There;--you may answer his letter; I won\'t."\r\n\r\n"And about the money?"\r\n\r\n"Why doesn\'t he write to Gazebee about his dirty money? Why does he\r\ntrouble me? I haven\'t got his money. Ask Gazebee about his money. I\r\nwon\'t trouble myself about it." Then there was another pause, during\r\nwhich the countess folded the letter, and put it in her pocket.\r\n\r\n"How long is George going to remain here with that woman?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure she is very harmless," pleaded the countess.\r\n\r\n"I always think when I see her that I\'m sitting down to dinner with\r\nmy own housemaid. I never saw such a woman. How he can put up with\r\nit! But I don\'t suppose he cares for anything."\r\n\r\n"It has made him very steady."\r\n\r\n"Steady!"\r\n\r\n"And as she will be confined before long it may be as well that she\r\nshould remain here. If Porlock doesn\'t marry, you know--"\r\n\r\n"And so he means to live here altogether, does he? I\'ll tell you what\r\nit is,--I won\'t have it. He\'s better able to keep a house over his\r\nown head and his wife\'s than I am to do it for them, and so you may\r\ntell them. I won\'t have it. D\'ye hear?" Then there was another short\r\npause. "D\'ye hear?" he shouted at her.\r\n\r\n"Yes; of course I hear. I was only thinking you wouldn\'t wish me to\r\nturn them out, just as her confinement is coming on."\r\n\r\n"I know what that means. Then they\'d never go. I won\'t have it; and\r\nif you don\'t tell them I will." In answer to this Lady De Courcy\r\npromised that she would tell them, thinking perhaps that the earl\'s\r\nmode of telling might not be beneficial in that particular epoch\r\nwhich was now coming in the life of Mrs. George.\r\n\r\n"Did you know," said he, breaking out on a new subject, "that a man\r\nhad been here named Dale, calling on somebody in this house?" In\r\nanswer to which the countess acknowledged that she had known it.\r\n\r\n"Then why did you keep it from me?" And that gnashing of the teeth\r\ntook place which was so specially objectionable to Mrs. George.\r\n\r\n"It was a matter of no moment. He came to see Lady Julia De Guest."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but he came about that man Crosbie."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he did."\r\n\r\n"Why have you let that girl be such a fool? You\'ll find he\'ll play\r\nher some knave\'s trick."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no."\r\n\r\n"And why should she want to marry such a man as that?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s quite a gentleman, you know, and very much thought of in the\r\nworld. It won\'t be at all bad for her, poor thing. It is so very hard\r\nfor a girl to get married now-a-days without money."\r\n\r\n"And so they\'re to take up with anybody. As far as I can see, this is\r\na worse affair than that of Amelia."\r\n\r\n"Amelia has done very well, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Oh, if you call it doing well for your girls, I don\'t. I call it\r\ndoing uncommon badly; about as bad as they well can do. But it\'s your\r\naffair. I have never meddled with them, and don\'t intend to do it\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"I really think she\'ll be happy, and she is devotedly attached to the\r\nyoung man."\r\n\r\n"Devotedly attached to the young man!" The tone and manner in which\r\nthe earl repeated these words were such as to warrant an opinion that\r\nhis lordship might have done very well on the stage had his attention\r\nbeen called to that profession. "It makes me sick to hear people\r\ntalk in that way. She wants to get married, and she\'s a fool for her\r\npains;--I can\'t help that; only remember that I\'ll have no nonsense\r\nhere about that other girl. If he gives me trouble of that sort, by\r\n----, I\'ll be the death of him. When is the marriage to be?"\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: "Devotedly attached to the young man!"]\r\n\r\n\r\n"They talk of February."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t have any tomfoolery and expense. If she chooses to marry a\r\nclerk in an office, she shall marry him as clerks are married."\r\n\r\n"He\'ll be the secretary before that, De Courcy."\r\n\r\n"What difference does that make? Secretary, indeed! What sort of\r\nmen do you suppose secretaries are? A beggar that came from nobody\r\nknows where! I won\'t have any tomfoolery;--d\'ye hear?" Whereupon\r\nthe countess said that she did hear, and soon afterwards managed to\r\nescape. The valet then took his turn; and repeated, after his hour\r\nof service, that "Old Nick" in his tantrums had been more like the\r\nPrince of Darkness than ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n"ON MY HONOUR, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT."\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Lady Alexandrina endeavoured to realize to herself\r\nall the advantages and disadvantages of her own position. She was not\r\npossessed of strong affections, nor of depth of character, nor of\r\nhigh purpose; but she was no fool, nor was she devoid of principle.\r\nShe had asked herself many times whether her present life was so\r\nhappy as to make her think that a permanent continuance in it would\r\nsuffice for her desires, and she had always replied to herself that\r\nshe would fain change to some other life if it were possible. She\r\nhad also questioned herself as to her rank, of which she was quite\r\nsufficiently proud, and had told herself that she could not degrade\r\nherself in the world without a heavy pang. But she had at last taught\r\nherself to believe that she had more to gain by becoming the wife of\r\nsuch a man as Crosbie than by remaining as an unmarried daughter of\r\nher father\'s house. There was much in her sister Amelia\'s position\r\nwhich she did not envy, but there was less to envy in that of her\r\nsister Rosina. The Gazebee house in St. John\'s Wood Road was not\r\nso magnificent as Courcy Castle; but then it was less dull, less\r\nembittered by torment, and was moreover her sister\'s own.\r\n\r\n"Very many do marry commoners," she had said to Margaretta.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, of course. It makes a difference, you know, when a man has\r\na fortune."\r\n\r\nOf course it did make a difference. Crosbie had no fortune, was not\r\neven so rich as Mr. Gazebee, could keep no carriage, and would have\r\nno country house. But then he was a man of fashion, was more thought\r\nof in the world than Mr. Gazebee, might probably rise in his own\r\nprofession,--and was at any rate thoroughly presentable. She would\r\nhave preferred a gentleman with L5,000 a year; but then as no\r\ngentleman with L5,000 a year came that way, would she not be happier\r\nwith Mr. Crosbie than she would be with no husband at all? She was\r\nnot very much in love with Mr. Crosbie, but she thought that she\r\ncould live with him comfortably, and that on the whole it would be a\r\ngood thing to be married.\r\n\r\nAnd she made certain resolves as to the manner in which she would do\r\nher duty by her husband. Her sister Amelia was paramount in her own\r\nhouse, ruling indeed with a moderate, endurable dominion, and ruling\r\nmuch to her husband\'s advantage. Alexandrina feared that she would\r\nnot be allowed to rule, but she could at any rate try. She would do\r\nall in her power to make him comfortable, and would be specially\r\ncareful not to irritate him by any insistence on her own higher rank.\r\nShe would be very meek in this respect; and if children should come\r\nshe would be as painstaking about them as though her own father had\r\nbeen merely a clergyman or a lawyer. She thought also much about\r\npoor Lilian Dale, asking herself sundry questions, with an idea of\r\nbeing high-principled as to her duty in that respect. Was she wrong\r\nin taking Mr. Crosbie away from Lilian Dale? In answer to these\r\nquestions she was able to assure herself comfortably that she was\r\nnot wrong. Mr. Crosbie would not, under any circumstances, marry\r\nLilian Dale. He had told her so more than once, and that in a solemn\r\nway. She could therefore be doing no harm to Lilian Dale. If she\r\nentertained any inner feeling that Crosbie\'s fault in jilting Lilian\r\nDale was less than it would have been had she herself not been an\r\nearl\'s daughter,--that her own rank did in some degree extenuate her\r\nlover\'s falseness,--she did not express it in words even to herself.\r\n\r\nShe did not get very much sympathy from her own family. "I\'m afraid\r\nhe does not think much of his religious duties. I\'m told that young\r\nmen of that sort seldom do," said Rosina. "I don\'t say you\'re wrong,"\r\nsaid Margaretta. "By no means. Indeed I think less of it now than\r\nI did when Amelia did the same thing. I shouldn\'t do it myself,\r\nthat\'s all." Her father told her that he supposed she knew her own\r\nmind. Her mother, who endeavoured to comfort and in some sort to\r\ncongratulate her, nevertheless, harped constantly on the fact that\r\nshe was marrying a man without rank and without a fortune. Her\r\ncongratulations were apologetic, and her comfortings took the guise\r\nof consolation. "Of course you won\'t be rich, my dear; but I really\r\nthink you\'ll do very well. Mr. Crosbie may be received anywhere, and\r\nyou never need be ashamed of him." By which the countess implied that\r\nher elder married daughter was occasionally called on to be ashamed\r\nof her husband. "I wish he could keep a carriage for you, but perhaps\r\nthat will come some day." Upon the whole Alexandrina did not repent,\r\nand stoutly told her father that she did know her own mind.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time Lily Dale was as yet perfect in her happiness.\r\nThat delay of a day or two in the receipt of the expected letter from\r\nher lover had not disquieted her. She had promised him that she would\r\nnot distrust him, and she was firmly minded to keep her promises.\r\nIndeed no idea of breaking it came to her at this time. She was\r\ndisappointed when the postman would come and bring no letter for\r\nher,--disappointed, as is the husbandman when the longed-for rain\r\ndoes not come to refresh the parched earth; but she was in no degree\r\nangry. "He will explain it," she said to herself. And she assured\r\nBell that men never recognized the hunger and thirst after letters\r\nwhich women feel when away from those whom they love.\r\n\r\nThen they heard at the Small House that the squire had gone away from\r\nAllington. During the last few days Bernard had not been much with\r\nthem, and now they heard the news, not through their cousin, but\r\nfrom Hopkins. "I really can\'t undertake to say, Miss Bell, where the\r\nmaster\'s gone to. It\'s not likely the master\'d tell me where he was\r\ngoing to; not unless it was about seeds, or the likes of that."\r\n\r\n"He has gone very suddenly," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"Well, miss, I\'ve nothing to say to that. And why shouldn\'t he go\r\nsudden if he likes? I only know he had his gig, and went to the\r\nstation. If you was to bury me alive I couldn\'t tell you more."\r\n\r\n"I should like to try," said Lily as they walked away. "He is such a\r\ncross old thing. I wonder whether Bernard has gone with my uncle."\r\nAnd then they thought no more about it.\r\n\r\nOn the day after that Bernard came down to the Small House, but he\r\nsaid nothing by way of accounting for the squire\'s absence. "He is in\r\nLondon, I know," said Bernard.\r\n\r\n"I hope he\'ll call on Mr. Crosbie," said Lily. But on this subject\r\nBernard said not a word. He did ask Lily whether she had heard from\r\nAdolphus, in answer to which she replied, with as indifferent a voice\r\nas she could assume, that she had not had a letter that morning.\r\n\r\n"I shall be angry with him if he\'s not a good correspondent," said\r\nMrs. Dale, when she and Lily were alone together.\r\n\r\n"No, mamma, you mustn\'t be angry with him. I won\'t let you be angry\r\nwith him. Please to remember he\'s my lover and not yours."\r\n\r\n"But I can see you when you watch for the postman."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t watch for the postman any more if it makes you have bad\r\nthoughts about him. Yes, they are bad thoughts. I won\'t have you\r\nthink that he doesn\'t do everything that is right."\r\n\r\nOn the next morning the postman brought a letter, or rather a note,\r\nand Lily at once saw that it was from Crosbie. She had contrived to\r\nintercept it near the back door, at which the postman called, so that\r\nher mother should not watch her watchings, nor see her disappointment\r\nif none should come. "Thank you, Jane," she said, very calmly, when\r\nthe eager, kindly girl ran to her with the little missive; and she\r\nwalked off to some solitude, trying to hide her impatience. The note\r\nhad seemed so small that it amazed her; but when she opened it the\r\ncontents amazed her more. There was neither beginning nor end. There\r\nwas no appellation of love, and no signature. It contained but two\r\nlines. "I will write to you at length to-morrow. This is my first\r\nday in London, and I have been so driven about that I cannot write."\r\nThat was all, and it was scrawled on half a sheet of note-paper. Why,\r\nat any rate, had he not called her his dearest Lily? Why had he not\r\nassured her that he was ever her own? Such expressions, meaning so\r\nmuch, may be conveyed in a glance of the pen. "Ah," she said, "if he\r\nknew how I hunger and thirst after his love!"\r\n\r\nShe had but a moment left to her before she must join her mother and\r\nsister, and she used that moment in remembering her promise. "I know\r\nit is all right," she said to herself. "He does not think of these\r\nthings as I do. He had to write at the last moment,--as he was\r\nleaving his office." And then with a quiet, smiling face, she walked\r\ninto the breakfast-parlour.\r\n\r\n"What does he say, Lily?" asked Bell.\r\n\r\n"What would you give to know?" said Lily.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t give twopence for the whole of it," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"When you get anybody to write to you letters, I wonder whether\r\nyou\'ll show them to everybody?"\r\n\r\n"But if there\'s any special London news, I suppose we might hear it,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"But suppose there\'s no special London news, mamma. The poor man had\r\nonly been in town one day, you know: and there never is any news at\r\nthis time of the year."\r\n\r\n"Had he seen uncle Christopher?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he had; but he doesn\'t say. We shall get all the news\r\nfrom him when he comes. He cares much more about London news than\r\nAdolphus does." And then there was no more said about the letter.\r\n\r\nBut Lily had read her two former letters over and over again at the\r\nbreakfast-table; and though she had not read them aloud, she had\r\nrepeated many words out of them, and had so annotated upon them that\r\nher mother, who had heard her, could have almost re-written them.\r\nNow, she did not even show the paper; and then her absence, during\r\nwhich she had read the letter, had hardly exceeded a minute or two.\r\nAll this Mrs. Dale observed, and she knew that her daughter had been\r\nagain disappointed.\r\n\r\nIn fact that day Lily was very serious, but she did not appear to\r\nbe unhappy. Early after breakfast Bell went over to the parsonage,\r\nand Mrs. Dale and her youngest daughter sat together over their work.\r\n"Mamma," she said, "I hope you and I are not to be divided when I go\r\nto live in London."\r\n\r\n"We shall never be divided in heart, my love."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but that will not be enough for happiness, though perhaps enough\r\nto prevent absolute unhappiness. I shall want to see you, touch you,\r\nand pet you as I do now." And she came and knelt on the cushion at\r\nher mother\'s feet.\r\n\r\n"You will have some one else to caress and pet,--perhaps many\r\nothers."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say that you are going to throw me off, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"God forbid, my darling. It is not mothers that throw off their\r\nchildren. What shall I have left when you and Bell are gone from me?"\r\n\r\n"But we will never be gone. That\'s what I mean. We are to be just the\r\nsame to you always, even though we are married. I must have my right\r\nto be here as much as I have it now; and, in return, you shall have\r\nyour right to be there. His house must be a home to you,--not a cold\r\nplace which you may visit now and again, with your best clothes on.\r\nYou know what I mean, when I say that we must not be divided."\r\n\r\n"But Lily--"\r\n\r\n"Well, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"I have no doubt we shall be happy together,--you and I."\r\n\r\n"But you were going to say more than that."\r\n\r\n"Only this,--that your house will be his house, and will be full\r\nwithout me. A daughter\'s marriage is always a painful parting."\r\n\r\n"Is it, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Not that I would have it otherwise than it is. Do not think that I\r\nwould wish to keep you at home with me. Of course you will both marry\r\nand leave me. I hope that he to whom you are going to devote yourself\r\nmay be spared to love you and protect you." Then the widow\'s heart\r\nbecame too full, and she put away her child from her that she might\r\nhide her face.\r\n\r\n"Mamma, mamma, I wish I was not going from you."\r\n\r\n"No, Lily; do not say that. I should not be contented with life if\r\nI did not see both my girls married. I think that it is the only lot\r\nwhich can give to a woman perfect content and satisfaction. I would\r\nhave you both married. I should be the most selfish being alive if I\r\nwished otherwise."\r\n\r\n"Bell will settle herself near you, and then you will see more of her\r\nand love her better than you do me."\r\n\r\n"I shall not love her better."\r\n\r\n"I wish she would marry some London man, and then you would come with\r\nus, and be near to us. Do you know, mamma, I sometimes think you\r\ndon\'t like this place here."\r\n\r\n"Your uncle has been very kind to give it to us."\r\n\r\n"I know he has; and we have been very happy here. But if Bell should\r\nleave you--"\r\n\r\n"Then should I go also. Your uncle has been very kind, but I\r\nsometimes feel that his kindness is a burden which I should not be\r\nstrong enough to bear solely on my own shoulders. And what should\r\nkeep me here, then?" Mrs. Dale as she said this felt that the "here"\r\nof which she spoke extended beyond the limits of the home which\r\nshe held through the charity of her brother-in-law. Might not all\r\nthe world, as far as she was concerned in it, be contained in that\r\n"here"? How was she to live if both her children should be taken\r\naway from her? She had already realized the fact that Crosbie\'s\r\nhouse could never be a home to her,--never even a temporary home.\r\nHer visits there must be of that full-dressed nature to which Lily\r\nhad alluded. It was impossible that she could explain this to Lily.\r\nShe would not prophesy that the hero of her girl\'s heart would be\r\ninhospitable to his wife\'s mother; but such had been her reading\r\nof Crosbie\'s character. Alas, alas, as matters were to go, his\r\nhospitality or inhospitality would be matter of small moment to them.\r\n\r\nAgain in the afternoon the two sisters were together, and Lily was\r\nstill more serious than her wont. It might almost have been gathered\r\nfrom her manner that this marriage of hers was about to take place at\r\nonce, and that she was preparing to leave her home. "Bell," she said,\r\n"I wonder why Dr. Crofts never comes to see us now?"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t a month since he was here, at our party."\r\n\r\n"A month! But there was a time when he made some pretext for being\r\nhere every other day."\r\n\r\n"Yes, when mamma was ill."\r\n\r\n"Ay, and since mamma was well, too. But I suppose I must not break\r\nthe promise you made me give you. He\'s not to be talked about even\r\nyet, is he?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say he was not to be talked about. You know what I meant,\r\nLily; and what I meant then, I mean now."\r\n\r\n"And how long will it be before you mean something else? I do hope it\r\nwill come some day,--I do indeed."\r\n\r\n"It never will, Lily. I once fancied that I cared for Dr. Crofts, but\r\nit was only fancy. I know it, because--" She was going to explain\r\nthat her knowledge on that point was assured to her, because since\r\nthat day she had felt that she might have learned to love another\r\nman. But that other man had been Mr. Crosbie, and so she stopped\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n"I wish he would come and ask you himself."\r\n\r\n"He will never do so. He would never ask such a question without\r\nencouragement, and I shall give him none. Nor will he ever think of\r\nmarrying till he can do so without,--without what he thinks to be\r\nimprudence as regards money. He has courage enough to be poor himself\r\nwithout unhappiness, but he has not courage to endure poverty with a\r\nwife. I know well what his feelings are."\r\n\r\n"Well, we shall see," said Lily. "I shouldn\'t wonder if you were\r\nmarried first now, Bell. For my part I\'m quite prepared to wait for\r\nthree years."\r\n\r\nLate on that evening the squire returned to Allington, Bernard having\r\ndriven over to meet him at the station. He had telegraphed to his\r\nnephew that he would be back by a late train, and no more than this\r\nhad been heard from him since he went. On that day Bernard had seen\r\nnone of the ladies at the Small House. With Bell at the present\r\nmoment it was impossible that he should be on easy terms. He could\r\nnot meet her alone without recurring to the one special subject of\r\ninterest between them, and as to that he did not choose to speak\r\nwithout much forethought. He had not known himself, when he had gone\r\nabout his wooing so lightly, thinking it a slight thing, whether or\r\nno he might be accepted. Now it was no longer a slight thing to him.\r\nI do not know that it was love that made him so eager; not good,\r\nhonest, downright love. But he had set his heart upon the object, and\r\nwith the wilfulness of a Dale was determined that it should be his.\r\nHe had no remotest idea of giving up his cousin, but he had at last\r\npersuaded himself that she was not to be won without some toil, and\r\nperhaps also some delay.\r\n\r\nNor had he been in a humour to talk either to Mrs. Dale or to Lily.\r\nHe feared that Lady Julia\'s news was true,--that at any rate there\r\nmight be in it something of truth; and while thus in doubt he could\r\nnot go down to the Small House. So he hung about the place by\r\nhimself, with a cigar in his mouth, fearing that something evil was\r\ngoing to happen, and when the message came for him, almost shuddered\r\nas he seated himself in the gig. What would it become him to do\r\nin this emergency if Crosbie had truly been guilty of the villany\r\nwith which Lady Julia had charged him? Thirty years ago he would\r\nhave called the man out, and shot at him till one of them was hit.\r\nNow-a-days it was hardly possible for a man to do that; and yet what\r\nwould the world say of him if he allowed such an injury as this to\r\npass without vengeance?\r\n\r\nHis uncle, as he came forth from the station with his travelling-bag\r\nin his hand, was stern, gloomy, and silent. He came out and took his\r\nplace in the gig almost without speaking. There were strangers about,\r\nand therefore his nephew at first could ask no question, but as the\r\ngig turned the corner out of the station-house yard he demanded the\r\nnews.\r\n\r\n"What have you heard?" he said.\r\n\r\nBut even then the squire did not answer at once. He shook his\r\nhead, and turned away his face, as though he did not choose to be\r\ninterrogated.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen him, sir?" asked Bernard.\r\n\r\n"No, he has not dared to see me."\r\n\r\n"Then it is true?"\r\n\r\n"True?--yes, it is all true. Why did you bring the scoundrel here? It\r\nhas been your fault."\r\n\r\n"No, sir; I must contradict that. I did not know him for a\r\nscoundrel."\r\n\r\n"But it was your duty to have known him before you brought him here\r\namong them. Poor girl! how is she to be told?"\r\n\r\n"Then she does not know it?"\r\n\r\n"I fear not. Have you seen them?"\r\n\r\n"I saw them yesterday, and she did not know it then; she may have\r\nheard it to-day."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think so. I believe he has been too great a coward to write\r\nto her. A coward indeed! How can any man find the courage to write\r\nsuch a letter as that?"\r\n\r\nBy degrees the squire told his tale. How he had gone to Lady Julia,\r\nhad made his way to London, had tracked Crosbie to his club, and had\r\nthere learned the whole truth from Crosbie\'s friend, Fowler Pratt, we\r\nalready know. "The coward escaped me while I was talking to the man\r\nhe sent down," said the squire. "It was a concerted plan, and I think\r\nhe was right. I should have brained him in the hall of the club."\r\nOn the following morning Pratt had called upon him at his inn with\r\nCrosbie\'s apology. "His apology!" said the squire. "I have it in my\r\npocket. Poor reptile; wretched worm of a man! I cannot understand\r\nit. On my honour, Bernard, I do not understand it. I think men are\r\nchanged since I knew much of them. It would have been impossible for\r\nme to write such a letter as that." He went on telling how Pratt had\r\nbrought him this letter, and had stated that Crosbie declined an\r\ninterview. "The gentleman had the goodness to assure me that no good\r\ncould come from such a meeting. \'You mean,\' I answered, \'that I\r\ncannot touch pitch and not be defiled!\' He acknowledged that the man\r\nwas pitch. Indeed, he could not say a word for his friend."\r\n\r\n"I know Pratt. He is a gentleman. I am sure he would not excuse him."\r\n\r\n"Excuse him! How could any one excuse him? Words could not be found\r\nto excuse him." And then he sat silent for some half mile. "On my\r\nhonour, Bernard, I can hardly yet bring myself to believe it. It is\r\nso new to me. It makes me feel that the world is changed, and that it\r\nis no longer worth a man\'s while to live in it."\r\n\r\n"And he is engaged to this other girl?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; with the full consent of the family. It is all arranged,\r\nand the settlements, no doubt, in the lawyer\'s hands by this time. He\r\nmust have gone away from here determined to throw her over. Indeed,\r\nI don\'t suppose he ever meant to marry her. He was just passing away\r\nhis time here in the country."\r\n\r\n"He meant it up to the time of his leaving."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it. Had he found me able and willing to give her a\r\nfortune he might, perhaps, have married her. But I don\'t think he\r\nmeant it for a moment after I told him that she would have nothing.\r\nWell, here we are. I may truly say that I never before came back to\r\nmy own house with so sore a heart."\r\n\r\nThey sat silently over their supper, the squire showing more open\r\nsorrow than might have been expected from his character. "What am\r\nI to say to them in the morning?" he repeated over and over again.\r\n"How am I to do it? And if I tell the mother, how is she to tell her\r\nchild?"\r\n\r\n"Do you think that he has given no intimation of his purpose?"\r\n\r\n"As far as I can tell, none. That man Pratt knew that he had not done\r\nso yesterday afternoon. I asked him what were the intentions of his\r\nblackguard friend, and he said that he did not know--that Crosbie\r\nwould probably have written to me. Then he brought me this letter.\r\nThere it is," and the squire threw the letter over the table; "read\r\nit and let me have it back. He thinks probably that the trouble is\r\nnow over as far as he is concerned."\r\n\r\nIt was a vile letter to have written--not because the language was\r\nbad, or the mode of expression unfeeling, or the facts falsely\r\nstated--but because the thing to be told was in itself so vile.\r\nThere are deeds which will not bear a gloss--sins as to which the\r\nperpetrator cannot speak otherwise than as a reptile; circumstances\r\nwhich change a man and put upon him the worthlessness of vermin.\r\nCrosbie had struggled hard to write it, going home to do it after his\r\nlast interview on that night with Pratt. But he had sat moodily in\r\nhis chair at his lodgings, unable to take the pen in his hand. Pratt\r\nwas to come to him at his office on the following morning, and he\r\nwent to bed resolving that he would write it at his desk. On the next\r\nday Pratt was there before a word of it had been written.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t stand this kind of thing," said Pratt. "If you mean me to\r\ntake it, you must write it at once." Then, with inward groaning,\r\nCrosbie sat himself at his table, and the words at last were\r\nforthcoming. Such words as they were! "I know that I can have no\r\nexcuse to make to you--or to her. But, circumstanced as I now am,\r\nthe truth is the best. I feel that I should not make Miss Dale\r\nhappy; and, therefore, as an honest man, I think I best do my duty\r\nby relinquishing the honour which she and you had proposed for me."\r\nThere was more of it, but we all know of what words such letters are\r\ncomposed, and how men write when they feel themselves constrained to\r\nwrite as reptiles.\r\n\r\n"As an honest man!" repeated the squire. "On my honour, Bernard, as a\r\ngentleman, I do not understand it. I cannot believe it possible that\r\nthe man who wrote that letter was sitting the other day as a guest at\r\nmy table."\r\n\r\n"What are we to do to him?" said Bernard, after a while.\r\n\r\n"Treat him as you would a rat. Throw your stick at him, if he comes\r\nunder your feet; but beware, above all things, that he does not get\r\ninto your house. That is too late for us now."\r\n\r\n"There must be more than that, uncle."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what more. There are deeds for committing which a\r\nman is doubly damned, because he has screened himself from overt\r\npunishment by the nature of his own villany. We have to remember\r\nLily\'s name, and do what may best tend to her comfort. Poor girl!\r\npoor girl!"\r\n\r\nThen they were silent, till the squire rose and took his bed candle.\r\n"Bernard," he said, "let my sister-in-law know early to-morrow that\r\nI will see her here, if she will be good enough to come to me after\r\nbreakfast. Do not have anything else said at the Small House. It may\r\nbe that he has written to-day."\r\n\r\nThen the squire went to bed, and Bernard sat over the dining-room\r\nfire, meditating on it all. How would the world expect that he should\r\nbehave to Crosbie? and what should he do when he met Crosbie at the\r\nclub?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE BOARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: (untitled)]\r\n\r\nCrosbie, as we already know, went to his office in Whitehall on the\r\nmorning after his escape from Sebright\'s, at which establishment he\r\nleft the Squire of Allington in conference with Fowler Pratt. He had\r\nseen Fowler Pratt again that same night, and the course of the story\r\nwill have shown what took place at that interview.\r\n\r\nHe went early to his office, knowing that he had before him the work\r\nof writing two letters, neither of which would run very glibly from\r\nhis pen. One was to be his missive to the squire, to be delivered by\r\nhis friend; the other, that fatal epistle to poor Lily, which, as the\r\nday passed away, he found himself utterly unable to accomplish. The\r\nletter to the squire he did write, under certain threats; and, as we\r\nhave seen, was considered to have degraded himself to the vermin rank\r\nof humanity by the meanness of his production.\r\n\r\nBut on reaching his office he found that other cares awaited\r\nhim,--cares which he would have taken much delight in bearing, had\r\nthe state of his mind enabled him to take delight in anything. On\r\nentering the lobby of his office, at ten o\'clock, he became aware\r\nthat he was received by the messengers assembled there with almost\r\nmore than their usual deference. He was always a great man at\r\nthe General Committee Office; but there are shades of greatness\r\nand shades of deference, which, though quite beyond the powers\r\nof definition, nevertheless manifest themselves clearly to the\r\nexperienced ear and eye. He walked through to his own apartment, and\r\nthere found two official letters addressed to him lying on his table.\r\nThe first which came to hand, though official, was small, and marked\r\nprivate, and it was addressed in the handwriting of his old friend,\r\nButterwell, the outgoing secretary. "I shall see you in the morning,\r\nnearly as soon as you get this," said the semi-official note; "but\r\nI must be the first to congratulate you on the acquisition of my old\r\nshoes. They will be very easy in the wearing to you, though they\r\npinched my corns a little at first. I dare say they want new soling,\r\nand perhaps they are a little down at heels; but you will find some\r\nexcellent cobbler to make them all right, and will give them a grace\r\nin the wearing which they have sadly lacked since they came into my\r\npossession. I wish you much joy with them," &c., &c. He then opened\r\nthe larger official letter, but that had now but little interest for\r\nhim. He could have made a copy of the contents without seeing them.\r\nThe Board of Commissioners had had great pleasure in promoting him to\r\nthe office of secretary, vacated by the promotion of Mr. Butterwell\r\nto a seat at their own Board; and then the letter was signed by Mr.\r\nButterwell himself.\r\n\r\nHow delightful to him would have been this welcome on his return\r\nto his office had his heart in other respects been free from care!\r\nAnd as he thought of this, he remembered all Lily\'s charms. He told\r\nhimself how much she excelled the noble scion of the De Courcy stock,\r\nwith whom he was now destined to mate himself; how the bride he\r\nhad rejected excelled the one he had chosen in grace, beauty, faith,\r\nfreshness, and all feminine virtues. If he could only wipe out the\r\nlast fortnight from the facts of his existence! But fortnights such\r\nas those are not to be wiped out,--not even with many sorrowful years\r\nof tedious scrubbing.\r\n\r\nAnd at this moment it seemed to him as though all those impediments\r\nwhich had frightened him when he had thought of marrying Lily Dale\r\nwere withdrawn. That which would have been terrible with seven or\r\neight hundred a year, would have been made delightful with twelve or\r\nthirteen. Why had his fate been so unkind to him? Why had not this\r\npromotion come to him but one fortnight earlier? Why had it not been\r\ndeclared before he had made his visit to that terrible castle? He\r\neven said to himself that if he had positively known the fact before\r\nPratt had seen Mr. Dale, he would have sent a different message to\r\nthe squire, and would have braved the anger of all the race of the De\r\nCourcys. But in that he lied to himself, and he knew that he did so.\r\nAn earl, in his imagination, was hedged by so strong a divinity, that\r\nhis treason towards Alexandrina could do no more than peep at what\r\nit would. It had been considered but little by him, when the project\r\nfirst offered itself to his mind, to jilt the niece of a small rural\r\nsquire; but it was not in him to jilt the daughter of a countess.\r\n\r\nThat house full of babies in St. John\'s Wood appeared to him now\r\nunder a very different guise from that which it wore as he sat in his\r\nroom at Courcy Castle on the evening of his arrival there. Then such\r\nan establishment had to him the flavour of a graveyard. It was as\r\nthough he were going to bury himself alive. Now that it was out of\r\nhis reach, he thought of it as a paradise upon earth. And then he\r\nconsidered what sort of a paradise Lady Alexandrina would make for\r\nhim. It was astonishing how ugly was the Lady Alexandrina, how old,\r\nhow graceless, how destitute of all pleasant charm, seen through the\r\nspectacles which he wore at the present moment.\r\n\r\nDuring his first hour at the office he did nothing. One or two of the\r\nyounger clerks came in and congratulated him with much heartiness. He\r\nwas popular at his office, and they had got a step by his promotion.\r\nThen he met one or two of the elder clerks, and was congratulated\r\nwith much less heartiness. "I suppose it\'s all right," said one bluff\r\nold gentleman. "My time is gone by, I know. I married too early to be\r\nable to wear a good coat when I was young, and I never was acquainted\r\nwith any lords or lords\' families." The sting of this was the sharper\r\nbecause Crosbie had begun to feel how absolutely useless to him had\r\nbeen all that high interest and noble connection which he had formed.\r\nHe had really been promoted because he knew more about his work than\r\nany of the other men, and Lady De Courcy\'s influential relation at\r\nthe India Board had not yet even had time to write a note upon the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nAt eleven Mr. Butterwell came into Crosbie\'s room, and the new\r\nsecretary was forced to clothe himself in smiles. Mr. Butterwell was\r\na pleasant, handsome man of about fifty, who had never yet set the\r\nThames on fire, and had never attempted to do so. He was perhaps a\r\nlittle more civil to great men and a little more patronizing to those\r\nbelow him than he would have been had he been perfect. But there\r\nwas something frank and English even in his mode of bowing before\r\nthe mighty ones, and to those who were not mighty he was rather too\r\ncivil than either stern or supercilious. He knew that he was not very\r\nclever, but he knew also how to use those who were clever. He seldom\r\nmade any mistake, and was very scrupulous not to tread on men\'s\r\ncorns. Though he had no enemies, yet he had a friend or two; and we\r\nmay therefore say of Mr. Butterwell that he had walked his path in\r\nlife discreetly. At the age of thirty-five he had married a lady with\r\nsome little fortune, and now he lived a pleasant, easy, smiling life\r\nin a villa at Putney. When Mr. Butterwell heard, as he often did\r\nhear, of the difficulty which an English gentleman has of earning his\r\nbread in his own country, he was wont to look back on his own career\r\nwith some complacency. He knew that he had not given the world much;\r\nyet he had received largely, and no one had begrudged it to him.\r\n"Tact," Mr. Butterwell used to say to himself, as he walked along the\r\npaths of his Putney villa. "Tact. Tact. Tact."\r\n\r\n"Crosbie," he said, as he entered the room cheerily, "I congratulate\r\nyou with all my heart. I do, indeed. You have got the step early in\r\nlife, and you deserve it thoroughly;--much better than I did when I\r\nwas appointed to the same office."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Crosbie, gloomily.\r\n\r\n"But I say, Oh, yes. We are deuced lucky to have such a man, and so I\r\ntold the commissioners."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I\'m very much obliged to you."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve known it all along,--before you left even. Sir Raffle Buffle\r\nhad told me he was to go to the Income-tax Office. The chair is two\r\nthousand there, you know; and I had been promised the first seat at\r\nthe Board."\r\n\r\n"Ah;--I wish I\'d known," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"You are much better as you are," said Butterwell. "There\'s no\r\npleasure like a surprise! Besides, one knows a thing of that kind,\r\nand yet doesn\'t know it. I don\'t mind saying now that I knew\r\nit,--swearing that I knew it,--but I wouldn\'t have said so to a\r\nliving being the day before yesterday. There are such slips between\r\nthe cups and the lips. Suppose Sir Raffle had not gone to the\r\nIncome-tax!"\r\n\r\n"Exactly so," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"But it\'s all right now. Indeed I sat at the Board yesterday, though\r\nI signed the letter afterwards. I\'m not sure that I don\'t lose more\r\nthan I gain."\r\n\r\n"What! with three hundred a year more and less work?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, but look at the interest of the thing. The secretary sees\r\neverything and knows everything. But I\'m getting old, and, as you\r\nsay, the lighter work will suit me. By the by, will you come down to\r\nPutney to-morrow? Mrs. Butterwell will be delighted to see the new\r\nsecretary. There\'s nobody in town now, so you can have no ground for\r\nrefusing."\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Crosbie did find some ground for refusing. It would have been\r\nimpossible for him to have sat and smiled at Mrs. Butterwell\'s table\r\nin his present frame of mind. In a mysterious, half-explanatory\r\nmanner, he let Mr. Butterwell know that private affairs of importance\r\nmade it absolutely necessary that he should remain that evening in\r\ntown. "And indeed," as he said, "he was not his own master just at\r\npresent."\r\n\r\n"By the by,--of course not. I had quite forgotten to congratulate you\r\non that head. So you\'re going to be married? Well; I\'m very glad, and\r\nhope you\'ll be as lucky as I have been."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Crosbie, again rather gloomily.\r\n\r\n"A young lady from near Guestwick, isn\'t it; or somewhere in those\r\nparts?"\r\n\r\n"N--no," stammered Crosbie. "The lady comes from Barsetshire."\r\n\r\n"Why, I heard the name. Isn\'t she a Bell, or Tait, or Ball, or some\r\nsuch name as that?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Crosbie, assuming what boldness he could command. "Her\r\nname is De Courcy."\r\n\r\n"One of the earl\'s daughters?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I beg your pardon. I\'d heard wrong. You\'re going to be allied\r\nto a very noble family, and I am heartily glad to hear of your\r\nsuccess in life." Then Butterwell shook him very cordially by the\r\nhand,--having offered him no such special testimony of approval when\r\nunder the belief that he was going to marry a Bell, a Tait, or a\r\nBall. All the same, Mr. Butterwell began to think that there was\r\nsomething wrong. He had heard from an indubitable source that\r\nCrosbie had engaged himself to a niece of a squire with whom he\r\nhad been staying near Guestwick,--a girl without any money; and Mr.\r\nButterwell, in his wisdom, had thought his friend Crosbie to be\r\nrather a fool for his pains. But now he was going to marry one of the\r\nDe Courcys! Mr. Butterwell was rather at his wits\' ends.\r\n\r\n"Well; we shall be sitting at two, you know, and of course you\'ll\r\ncome to us. If you\'re at leisure before that I\'ll make over what\r\npapers I have to you. I\'ve not been a Lord Eldon in my office, and\r\nthey won\'t break your back."\r\n\r\nImmediately after that Fowler Pratt had been shown into Crosbie\'s\r\nroom, and Crosbie had written the letter to the squire under Pratt\'s\r\neye.\r\n\r\nHe could take no joy in his promotion. When Pratt left him he tried\r\nto lighten his heart. He endeavoured to throw Lily and her wrongs\r\nbehind him, and fix his thoughts on his advancing successes in life;\r\nbut he could not do it. A self-imposed trouble will not allow itself\r\nto be banished. If a man lose a thousand pounds by a friend\'s fault,\r\nor by a turn in the wheel of fortune, he can, if he be a man, put\r\nhis grief down and trample it under foot; he can exorcise the spirit\r\nof his grievance, and bid the evil one depart from out of his house.\r\nBut such exorcism is not to be used when the sorrow has come from a\r\nman\'s own folly and sin;--especially not if it has come from his own\r\nselfishness. Such are the cases which make men drink; which drive\r\nthem on to the avoidance of all thought; which create gamblers and\r\nreckless prodigals; which are the promoters of suicide. How could he\r\navoid writing this letter to Lily? He might blow his brains out, and\r\nso let there be an end of it all. It was to such reflections that he\r\ncame, when he sat himself down endeavouring to reap satisfaction from\r\nhis promotion.\r\n\r\nBut Crosbie was not a man to commit suicide. In giving him his due I\r\nmust protest that he was too good for that. He knew too well that a\r\npistol-bullet could not be the be-all and the end-all here, and there\r\nwas too much manliness in him for so cowardly an escape. The burden\r\nmust be borne. But how was he to bear it? There he sat till it was\r\ntwo o\'clock, neglecting Mr. Butterwell and his office papers, and\r\nnot stirring from his seat till a messenger summoned him before the\r\nBoard. The Board, as he entered the room, was not such a Board as\r\nthe public may, perhaps, imagine such Boards to be. There was a\r\nround table, with a few pens lying about, and a comfortable leathern\r\narm-chair at the side of it, farthest from the door. Sir Raffle\r\nBuffle was leaving his late colleagues, and was standing with his\r\nback to the fire-place, talking very loudly. Sir Raffle was a great\r\nbully, and the Board was uncommonly glad to be rid of him; but as\r\nthis was to be his last appearance at the Committee Office, they\r\nsubmitted to his voice meekly. Mr. Butterwell was standing close to\r\nhim, essaying to laugh mildly at Sir Raffle\'s jokes. A little man,\r\nhardly more than five feet high, with small but honest-looking eyes,\r\nand close-cut hair, was standing behind the arm-chair, rubbing his\r\nhands together, and longing for the departure of Sir Raffle, in order\r\nthat he might sit down. This was Mr. Optimist, the new chairman,\r\nin praise of whose appointment the Daily Jupiter had been so loud,\r\ndeclaring that the present Minister was showing himself superior\r\nto all Ministers who had ever gone before him, in giving promotion\r\nsolely on the score of merit. The Daily Jupiter, a fortnight since,\r\nhad published a very eloquent article, strongly advocating the claims\r\nof Mr. Optimist, and was naturally pleased to find that its advice\r\nhad been taken. Has not an obedient Minister a right to the praise of\r\nthose powers which he obeys?\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: The Board.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Optimist was, in truth, an industrious little gentleman, very\r\nwell connected, who had served the public all his life, and who was,\r\nat any rate, honest in his dealings. Nor was he a bully, such as his\r\npredecessor. It might, however, be a question whether he carried\r\nguns enough for the command in which he was now to be employed.\r\nThere was but one other member of the Board, Major Fiasco by name,\r\na discontented, broken-hearted, silent man, who had been sent to\r\nthe General Committee Office some few years before because he was\r\nnot wanted anywhere else. He was a man who had intended to do great\r\nthings when he entered public life, and had possessed the talent\r\nand energy for things moderately great. He had also possessed to a\r\ncertain extent the ear of those high in office; but, in some way,\r\nmatters had not gone well with him, and in running his course he had\r\ngone on the wrong side of the post. He was still in the prime of\r\nlife, and yet all men knew that Major Fiasco had nothing further to\r\nexpect from the public or from the Government. Indeed, there were not\r\nwanting those who said that Major Fiasco was already in receipt of a\r\nliberal income, for which he gave no work in return; that he merely\r\nfilled a chair for four hours a day four or five days a week, signing\r\nhis name to certain forms and documents, reading, or pretending to\r\nread, certain papers, but, in truth, doing no good. Major Fiasco, on\r\nthe other hand, considered himself to be a deeply injured individual,\r\nand he spent his life in brooding over his wrongs. He believed now\r\nin nothing and in nobody. He had begun public life striving to be\r\nhonest, and he now regarded all around him as dishonest. He had no\r\nsatisfaction in any man other than that which he found when some\r\nevent would show to him that this or that other compeer of his own\r\nhad proved himself to be self-interested, false, or fraudulent.\r\n"Don\'t tell me, Butterwell," he would say--for with Mr. Butterwell\r\nhe maintained some semi-official intimacy, and he would take that\r\ngentleman by the button-hole, holding him close. "Don\'t tell me. I\r\nknow what men are. I\'ve seen the world. I\'ve been looking at things\r\nwith my eyes open. I knew what he was doing." And then he would\r\ntell of the sly deed of some official known well to them both, not\r\ndenouncing it by any means, but affecting to take it for granted\r\nthat the man in question was a rogue. Butterwell would shrug his\r\nshoulders, and laugh gently, and say that, upon his word, he didn\'t\r\nthink the world so bad as Fiasco made it out to be.\r\n\r\nNor did he; for Butterwell believed in many things. He believed\r\nin his Putney villa on this earth, and he believed also that he\r\nmight achieve some sort of Putney villa in the world beyond without\r\nundergoing present martyrdom. His Putney villa first, with all its\r\nattendant comforts, and then his duty to the public afterwards. It\r\nwas thus that Mr. Butterwell regulated his conduct; and as he was\r\nsolicitous that the villa should be as comfortable a home to his wife\r\nas to himself, and that it should be specially comfortable to his\r\nfriends, I do not think that we need quarrel with his creed.\r\n\r\nMr. Optimist believed in everything, but especially he believed in\r\nthe Prime Minister, in the Daily Jupiter, in the General Committee\r\nOffice, and in himself. He had long thought that everything was\r\nnearly right; but now that he himself was chairman at the General\r\nCommittee Office, he was quite sure that everything must be right.\r\nIn Sir Raffle Buffle, indeed, he had never believed; and now it was,\r\nperhaps, the greatest joy of his life that he should never again be\r\ncalled upon to hear the tones of that terrible knight\'s hated voice.\r\n\r\nSeeing who were the components of the new Board, it may be presumed\r\nthat Crosbie would look forward to enjoying a not uninfluential\r\nposition in his office. There were, indeed, some among the clerks who\r\ndid not hesitate to say that the new secretary would have it pretty\r\nnearly all his own way. As for "Old Opt," there would be, they said,\r\nno difficulty about him. Only tell him that such and such a decision\r\nwas his own, and he would be sure to believe the teller. Butterwell\r\nwas not fond of work, and had been accustomed to lean upon Crosbie\r\nfor many years. As for Fiasco, he would be cynical in words, but\r\nwholly indifferent in deed. If the whole office were made to go to\r\nthe mischief, Fiasco, in his own grim way, would enjoy the confusion.\r\n\r\n"Wish you joy, Crosbie," said Sir Raffle, standing up on the rug,\r\nwaiting for the new secretary to go up to him and shake hands. But\r\nSir Raffle was going, and the new secretary did not indulge him.\r\n\r\n"Thank ye, Sir Raffle," said Crosbie, without going near the rug.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Crosbie, I congratulate you most sincerely," said Mr. Optimist.\r\n"Your promotion has been the result altogether of your own merit. You\r\nhave been selected for the high office which you are now called upon\r\nto fill solely because it has been thought that you are the most\r\nfit man to perform the onerous duties attached to it. Hum--h-m--ha.\r\nAs regards my share in the recommendation which we found ourselves\r\nbound to submit to the Treasury, I must say that I never felt less\r\nhesitation in my life, and I believe I may declare as much as regards\r\nthe other members of the Board." And Mr. Optimist looked around\r\nhim for approving words. He had come forward from his standing\r\nground behind his chair to welcome Crosbie, and had shaken his hand\r\ncordially. Fiasco also had risen from his seat, and had assured\r\nCrosbie in a whisper that he had feathered his nest uncommon well.\r\nThen he had sat down again.\r\n\r\n"Indeed you may, as far as I am concerned," said Butterwell.\r\n\r\n"I told the Chancellor of the Exchequer," said Sir Raffle, speaking\r\nvery loud and with much authority, "that unless he had some\r\nfirst-rate man to send from elsewhere I could name a fitting\r\ncandidate. \'Sir Raffle,\' he said, \'I mean to keep it in the office,\r\nand therefore shall be glad of your opinion.\' \'In that case, Mr.\r\nChancellor,\' said I, \'Mr. Crosbie must be the man.\' \'Mr. Crosbie\r\nshall be the man,\' said the Chancellor. And Mr. Crosbie is the man."\r\n\r\n"Your friend Sark spoke to Lord Brock about it," said Fiasco. Now the\r\nEarl of Sark was a young nobleman of much influence at the present\r\nmoment, and Lord Brock was the Prime Minister. "You should thank Lord\r\nSark."\r\n\r\n"Had as much to do with it as if my footman had spoken," said Sir\r\nRaffle.\r\n\r\n"I am very much obliged to the Board for their good opinion," said\r\nCrosbie, gravely. "I am obliged to Lord Sark as well,--and also to\r\nyour footman, Sir Raffle, if, as you seem to say, he has interested\r\nhimself in my favour."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say anything of the kind," said Sir Raffle. "I thought\r\nit right to make you understand that it was my opinion, given, of\r\ncourse, officially, which prevailed with the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer. Well, gentlemen, as I shall be wanted in the city, I will\r\nsay good morning to you. Is my carriage ready, Boggs?" Upon which the\r\nattendant messenger opened the door, and the great Sir Raffle Buffle\r\ntook his final departure from the scene of his former labours.\r\n\r\n"As to the duties of your new office"--and Mr. Optimist continued his\r\nspeech, taking no other notice of the departure of his enemy than\r\nwhat was indicated by an increased brightness of his eye and a more\r\nsatisfactory tone of voice--"you will find yourself quite familiar\r\nwith them."\r\n\r\n"Indeed he will," said Butterwell.\r\n\r\n"And I am quite sure that you will perform them with equal credit\r\nto yourself, satisfaction to the department, and advantage to the\r\npublic. We shall always be glad to have your opinion on any subject\r\nof importance that may come before us; and as regards the internal\r\ndiscipline of the office, we feel that we may leave it safely in your\r\nhands. In any matter of importance you will, of course, consult us,\r\nand I feel very confident that we shall go on together with great\r\ncomfort and with mutual confidence." Then Mr. Optimist looked at his\r\nbrother commissioners, sat down in his arm-chair, and taking in his\r\nhands some papers before him, began the routine business of the day.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly five o\'clock when, on this special occasion, the\r\nsecretary returned from the board-room to his own office. Not for\r\na moment had the weight been off his shoulders while Sir Raffle\r\nhad been bragging or Mr. Optimist making his speech. He had been\r\nthinking, not of them, but of Lily Dale; and though they had not\r\ndiscovered his thoughts, they had perceived that he was hardly like\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n"I never saw a man so little elated by good fortune in my life," said\r\nMr. Optimist.\r\n\r\n"Ah, he\'s got something on his mind," said Butterwell. "He\'s going to\r\nbe married, I believe."\r\n\r\n"If that\'s the case, it\'s no wonder he shouldn\'t be elated," said\r\nMajor Fiasco, who was himself a bachelor.\r\n\r\nWhen in his own room again, Crosbie at once seized on a sheet of\r\nnote-paper, as though by hurrying himself on with it he could get\r\nthat letter to Allington written. But though the paper was before\r\nhim, and the pen in his hand, the letter did not, would not, get\r\nitself written. With what words was he to begin it? To whom should it\r\nbe written? How was he to declare himself the villain which he had\r\nmade himself? The letters from his office were taken away every night\r\nshortly after six, and at six o\'clock he had not written a word. "I\r\nwill do it at home to-night," he said to himself, and then, tearing\r\noff a scrap of paper, he scratched those few lines which Lily\r\nreceived, and which she had declined to communicate to her mother or\r\nsister. Crosbie, as he wrote them, conceived that they would in some\r\nway prepare the poor girl for the coming blow,--that they would, at\r\nany rate, make her know that all was not right; but in so supposing\r\nhe had not counted on the constancy of her nature, nor had he thought\r\nof the promise which she had given him that nothing should make her\r\ndoubt him. He wrote the scrap, and then taking his hat walked off\r\nthrough the gloom of the November evening up Charing Cross and St.\r\nMartin\'s Lane, towards the Seven Dials and Bloomsbury, into regions\r\nof the town with which he had no business, and which he never\r\nfrequented. He hardly knew where he went or wherefore. How was he\r\nto escape from the weight of the burden which was now crushing\r\nhim? It seemed to him as though he would change his position with\r\nthankfulness for that of the junior clerk in his office, if only that\r\njunior clerk had upon his mind no such betrayal of trust as that of\r\nwhich he was guilty.\r\n\r\nAt half-past seven he found himself at Sebright\'s, and there he\r\ndined. A man will dine, even though his heart be breaking. Then he\r\ngot into a cab, and had himself taken home to Mount Street. During\r\nhis walk he had sworn to himself that he would not go to bed that\r\nnight till the letter was written and posted. It was twelve before\r\nthe first words were marked on the paper, and yet he kept his oath.\r\nBetween two and three, in the cold moonlight, he crawled out and\r\ndeposited his letter in the nearest post-office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nJOHN EAMES RETURNS TO BURTON CRESCENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Eames and Crosbie returned to town on the same day. It will be\r\nremembered how Eames had assisted Lord De Guest in the matter of the\r\nbull, and how great had been the earl\'s gratitude on the occasion.\r\nThe memory of this, and the strong encouragement which he received\r\nfrom his mother and sister for having made such a friend by his\r\ngallantry, lent some slight satisfaction to his last hours at home.\r\nBut his two misfortunes were too serious to allow of anything like\r\nreal happiness. He was leaving Lily behind him, engaged to be married\r\nto a man whom he hated, and he was returning to Burton Crescent,\r\nwhere he would have to face Amelia Roper,--Amelia either in her rage\r\nor in her love. The prospect of Amelia in her rage was very terrible\r\nto him; but his greatest fear was of Amelia in her love. He had in\r\nhis letter declined matrimony; but what if she talked down all his\r\nobjections, and carried him off to church in spite of himself!\r\n\r\nWhen he reached London and got into a cab with his portmanteau, he\r\ncould hardly fetch up courage to bid the man drive him to Burton\r\nCrescent. "I might as well go to an hotel for the night," he said to\r\nhimself, "and then I can learn how things are going on from Cradell\r\nat the office." Nevertheless, he did give the direction to Burton\r\nCrescent, and when it was once given felt ashamed to change it. But,\r\nas he was driven up to the well-known door, his heart was so low\r\nwithin him that he might almost be said to have lost it. When the\r\ncabman demanded whether he should knock, he could not answer; and\r\nwhen the maid-servant at the door greeted him, he almost ran away.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s at home?" said he, asking the question in a very low voice.\r\n\r\n"There\'s missus," said the girl, "and Miss Spruce, and Mrs. Lupex.\r\nHe\'s away somewhere, in his tantrums again; and there\'s Mr.--"\r\n\r\n"Is Miss Roper here?" he said, still whispering.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes! Miss Mealyer\'s here," said the girl, speaking in a cruelly\r\nloud voice. "She was in the dining-room just now, putting out the\r\ntable. Miss Mealyer!" And the girl, as she called out the name,\r\nopened the dining-room door. Johnny Eames felt that his knees were\r\ntoo weak to support him.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Mealyer was not in the dining-room. She had perceived the\r\nadvancing cab of her sworn adorer, and had thought it expedient to\r\nretreat from her domestic duties, and fortify herself among her\r\nbrushes and ribbons. Had it been possible that she should know how\r\nvery weak and cowardly was the enemy against whom she was called upon\r\nto put herself in action, she might probably have fought her battle\r\nsomewhat differently, and have achieved a speedy victory, at the cost\r\nof an energetic shot or two. But she did not know. She thought it\r\nprobable that she might obtain power over him and manage him; but it\r\ndid not occur to her that his legs were so weak beneath him that she\r\nmight almost blow him over with a breath. None but the worst and most\r\nheartless of women know the extent of their own power over men;--as\r\nnone but the worst and most heartless of men know the extent of their\r\npower over women. Amelia Roper was not a good specimen of the female\r\nsex, but there were worse women than her.\r\n\r\n"She ain\'t there, Mr. Eames; but you\'ll see her in the drawen-room,"\r\nsaid the girl. "And it\'s she\'ll be glad to see you back again,\r\nMr. Eames." But he scrupulously passed the door of the upstairs\r\nsitting-room, not even looking within it, and contrived to get\r\nhimself into his own chamber without having encountered anybody.\r\n"Here\'s yer \'ot water, Mr. Eames," said the girl, coming up to him\r\nafter an interval of half-an-hour; "and dinner\'ll be on the table in\r\nten minutes. Mr. Cradell is come in, and so is missus\'s son."\r\n\r\nIt was still open to him to go out and dine at some eating-house in\r\nthe Strand. He could start out, leaving word that he was engaged,\r\nand so postpone the evil hour. He had almost made up his mind to\r\ndo so, and certainly would have done it, had not the sitting-room\r\ndoor opened as he was on the landing-place. The door opened, and he\r\nfound himself confronting the assembled company. First came Cradell,\r\nand leaning on his arm, I regret to say, was Mrs. Lupex,--_Egyptia\r\nconjux!_ Then there came Miss Spruce with young Roper; Amelia and her\r\nmother brought up the rear together. There was no longer question of\r\nflight now; and poor Eames, before he knew what he was doing, was\r\ncarried down into the dining-room with the rest of the company. They\r\nwere all glad to see him, and welcomed him back warmly, but he was\r\nso much beside himself that he could not ascertain whether Amelia\'s\r\nvoice was joined with the others. He was already seated at table, and\r\nhad before him a plate of soup, before he recognized the fact that he\r\nwas sitting between Mrs. Roper and Mrs. Lupex. The latter lady had\r\nseparated herself from Mr. Cradell as she entered the room. "Under\r\nall the circumstances perhaps it will be better for us to be apart,"\r\nshe said. "A lady can\'t make herself too safe; can she, Mrs. Roper?\r\nThere\'s no danger between you and me, is there, Mr. Eames,--specially\r\nwhen Miss Amelia is opposite?" The last words, however, were intended\r\nto be whispered into his ear.\r\n\r\nBut Johnny made no answer to her; contenting himself for the moment\r\nwith wiping the perspiration from his brow. There was Amelia opposite\r\nto him, looking at him--the very Amelia to whom he had written,\r\ndeclining the honour of marrying her. Of what her mood towards him\r\nmight be, he could form no judgment from her looks. Her face was\r\nsimply stern and impassive, and she seemed inclined to eat her dinner\r\nin silence. A slight smile of derision had passed across her face as\r\nshe heard Mrs. Lupex whisper, and it might have been discerned that\r\nher nose, at the same time, became somewhat elevated; but she said\r\nnot a word.\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'ve enjoyed yourself, Mr. Eames, among the vernal beauties\r\nof the country," said Mrs. Lupex.\r\n\r\n"Very much, thank you," he replied.\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing like the country at this autumnal season of the\r\nyear. As for myself, I\'ve never been accustomed to remain in London\r\nafter the breaking up of the _beau monde_. We\'ve usually been to\r\nBroadstairs, which is a very charming place, with most elegant\r\nsociety, but now--" and she shook her head, by which all the company\r\nknew that she intended to allude to the sins of Mr. Lupex.\r\n\r\n"I\'d never wish to sleep out of London for my part," said Mrs. Roper.\r\n"When a woman\'s got a house over her head, I don\'t think her mind\'s\r\never easy out of it."\r\n\r\nShe had not intended any reflection on Mrs. Lupex for not having a\r\nhouse of her own, but that lady immediately bristled up. "That\'s\r\njust what the snails say, Mrs. Roper. And as for having a house of\r\none\'s own, it\'s a very good thing, no doubt, sometimes; but that\'s\r\naccording to circumstances. It has suited me lately to live in\r\nlodgings, but there\'s no knowing whether I mayn\'t fall lower than\r\nthat yet, and have--" but here she stopped herself, and looking over\r\nat Mr. Cradell nodded her head.\r\n\r\n"And have to let them," said Mrs. Roper. "I hope you\'ll be more lucky\r\nwith your lodgers than I have been with some of mine. Jemima, hand\r\nthe potatoes to Miss Spruce. Miss Spruce, do let me send you a little\r\nmore gravy? There\'s plenty here, really." Mrs. Roper was probably\r\nthinking of Mr. Todgers.\r\n\r\n"I hope I shall," said Mrs. Lupex. "But, as I was saying, Broadstairs\r\nis delightful. Were you ever at Broadstairs, Mr. Cradell?"\r\n\r\n"Never, Mrs. Lupex. I generally go abroad in my leave. One sees more\r\nof the world, you know. I was at Dieppe last June, and found that\r\nvery delightful--though rather lonely. I shall go to Ostend this\r\nyear; only December is so late for Ostend. It was a deuced shame my\r\ngetting December, wasn\'t it, Johnny?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was," said Eames. "I managed better."\r\n\r\n"And what have you been doing, Mr. Eames?" said Mrs. Lupex, with one\r\nof her sweetest smiles. "Whatever it may have been, you\'ve not been\r\nfalse to the cause of beauty, I\'m sure." And she looked over to\r\nAmelia with a knowing smile. But Amelia was engaged upon her plate,\r\nand went on with her dinner without turning her eyes either on Mrs.\r\nLupex or on John Eames.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t done anything particular," said Eames. "I\'ve just been\r\nstaying with my mother."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve been very social here, haven\'t we, Miss Amelia?" continued\r\nMrs. Lupex. "Only now and then a cloud comes across the heavens,\r\nand the lights at the banquet are darkened." Then she put her\r\nhandkerchief up to her eyes, sobbing deeply, and they all knew that\r\nshe was again alluding to the sins of her husband.\r\n\r\nAs soon as dinner was over the ladies with young Mr. Roper retired,\r\nand Eames and Cradell were left to take their wine over the\r\ndining-room fire,--or their glass of gin and water, as it might be.\r\n"Well, Caudle, old fellow," said one. "Well, Johnny, my boy," said\r\nthe other. "What\'s the news at the office?" said Eames.\r\n\r\n"Muggeridge has been playing the very mischief." Muggeridge was the\r\nsecond clerk in Cradell\'s room. "We\'re going to put him into Coventry\r\nand not speak to him except officially. But to tell you the truth,\r\nmy hands have been so full here at home, that I haven\'t thought much\r\nabout the office. What am I to do about that woman?"\r\n\r\n"Do about her? How do about her?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; what am I to do about her? How am I to manage with her? There\'s\r\nLupex off again in one of his fits of jealousy."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s not your fault, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Well; I can\'t just say. I am fond of her, and that\'s the long and\r\nthe short of it; deuced fond of her."\r\n\r\n"But, my dear Caudle, you know she\'s that man\'s wife."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I know all about it. I\'m not going to defend myself. It\'s\r\nwrong, I know,--pleasant, but wrong. But what\'s a fellow to do? I\r\nsuppose in strict morality I ought to leave the lodgings. But, by\r\nGeorge, I don\'t see why a man\'s to be turned out in that way. And\r\nthen I couldn\'t make a clean score with old mother Roper. But I say,\r\nold fellow, who gave you the gold chain?"\r\n\r\n"Well; it was an old family friend at Guestwick; or rather, I should\r\nsay, a man who said he knew my father."\r\n\r\n"And he gave you that because he knew your governor! Is there a watch\r\nto it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, there\'s a watch. It wasn\'t exactly that. There was some trouble\r\nabout a bull. To tell the truth, it was Lord De Guest; the queerest\r\nfellow, Caudle, you ever met in your life; but such a trump. I\'ve got\r\nto go and dine with him at Christmas." And then the old story of the\r\nbull was told.\r\n\r\n"I wish I could find a lord in a field with a bull," said Cradell. We\r\nmay, however, be permitted to doubt whether Mr. Cradell would have\r\nearned a watch even if he had had his wish.\r\n\r\n"You see," continued Cradell, reverting to the subject on which\r\nhe most delighted to talk, "I\'m not responsible for that man\'s\r\nill-conduct."\r\n\r\n"Does anybody say you are?"\r\n\r\n"No; nobody says so. But people seem to think so. When he is by I\r\nhardly speak to her. She is thoughtless and giddy, as women are, and\r\ntakes my arm, and that kind of thing, you know. It makes him mad with\r\nrage, but upon my honour I don\'t think she means any harm."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose she does," said Eames.\r\n\r\n"Well; she may or she mayn\'t. I hope with all my heart she doesn\'t."\r\n\r\n"And where is he now?"\r\n\r\n"This is between ourselves, you know; but she went to find him\r\nthis afternoon. Unless he gives her money she can\'t stay here, nor,\r\nfor the matter of that, will she be able to go away. If I mention\r\nsomething to you, you won\'t tell any one?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I won\'t."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t have it known to any one for the world. I\'ve lent her\r\nseven pounds ten. It\'s that which makes me so short with mother\r\nRoper."\r\n\r\n"Then I think you\'re a fool for your pains."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s so like you. I always said you\'d no feeling of real\r\nromance. If I cared for a woman I\'d give her the coat off my back."\r\n\r\n"I\'d do better than that," said Johnny. "I\'d give her the heart\r\nout of my body. I\'d be chopped up alive for a girl I loved; but it\r\nshouldn\'t be for another man\'s wife."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a matter of taste. But she\'s been to Lupex to-day at that\r\nhouse he goes to in Drury Lane. She had a terrible scene there. He\r\nwas going to commit suicide in the middle of the street, and she\r\ndeclares that it all comes from jealousy. Think what a time I have\r\nof it--standing always, as one may say, on gunpowder. He may turn\r\nup here any moment, you know. But, upon my word, for the life of me\r\nI cannot desert her. If I were to turn my back on her she wouldn\'t\r\nhave a friend in the world. And how\'s L. D.? I\'ll tell you what it\r\nis--you\'ll have some trouble with the divine Amelia."\r\n\r\n"Shall I?"\r\n\r\n"By Jove, you will. But how\'s L. D. all this time?"\r\n\r\n"L. D. is engaged to be married to a man named Adolphus Crosbie,"\r\nsaid poor Johnny, slowly. "If you please, we will not say any more\r\nabout her."\r\n\r\n"Whew--w--w! That\'s what makes you so down in the mouth! L. D. going\r\nto marry Crosbie! Why, that\'s the man who is to be the new secretary\r\nat the General Committee Office. Old Huffle Scuffle, who was their\r\nchair, has come to us, you know. There\'s been a general move at the\r\nG. C., and this Crosbie has got to be secretary. He\'s a lucky chap,\r\nisn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know anything about his luck. He\'s one of those fellows that\r\nmake me hate them the first time I look at them. I\'ve a sort of a\r\nfeeling that I shall live to kick him some day."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the time, is it? Then I suppose Amelia will have it all her\r\nown way now."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what, Caudle. I\'d sooner get up through the trap-door,\r\nand throw myself off the roof into the area, than marry Amelia\r\nRoper."\r\n\r\n"Have you and she had any conversation since you came back?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word."\r\n\r\n"Then I tell you fairly you\'ve got trouble before you. Amelia and\r\nMaria--Mrs. Lupex, I mean--are as thick as thieves just at present,\r\nand they have been talking you over. Maria--that is, Mrs. Lupex--lets\r\nit all out to me. You\'ll have to mind where you are, old fellow."\r\n\r\nEames was not inclined to discuss the matter any further, so he\r\nfinished his toddy in silence. Cradell, however, who felt that there\r\nwas something in his affairs of which he had reason to be proud, soon\r\nreturned to the story of his own very extraordinary position. "By\r\nJove, I don\'t know that a man was ever so circumstanced," he said.\r\n"She looks to me to protect her, and yet what can I do?"\r\n\r\nAt last Cradell got up, and declared that he must go to the ladies.\r\n"She\'s so nervous, that unless she has some one to countenance her\r\nshe becomes unwell."\r\n\r\nEames declared his purpose of going to the divan, or to the theatre,\r\nor to take a walk in the streets. The smiles of beauty had no longer\r\ncharms for him in Burton Crescent.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll expect you to take a cup of tea the first night," said\r\nCradell; but Eames declared that they might expect it.\r\n\r\n"I\'m in no humour for it," said he. "I\'ll tell you what, Cradell,\r\nI shall leave this place, and take rooms for myself somewhere. I\'ll\r\nnever go into a lodging-house again."\r\n\r\nAs he so spoke, he was standing at the dining-room door; but he was\r\nnot allowed to escape in this easy way. Jemima, as he went out into\r\nthe passage, was there with a three-cornered note in her hand. "From\r\nMiss Mealyer," she said. "Miss Mealyer is in the back parlour all by\r\nherself."\r\n\r\nPoor Johnny took the note, and read it by the lamp over the front\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"Are you not going to speak to me on the day of your return? It\r\ncannot be that you will leave the house without seeing me for a\r\nmoment. I am in the back parlour."\r\n\r\nWhen he had read these words, he paused in the passage, with his\r\nhat on. Jemima, who could not understand why any young man should\r\nhesitate as to seeing his lady-love in the back parlour alone,\r\nwhispered to him again, in her audible way, "Miss Mealyer is there,\r\nsir; and all the rest on \'em\'s upstairs!" So compelled, Eames put\r\ndown his hat, and walked with slow steps into the back parlour.\r\n\r\nHow was it to be with the enemy? Was he to encounter Amelia in anger,\r\nor Amelia in love? She had seemed to be stern and defiant when he\r\nhad ventured to steal a look at her across the dining-table, and now\r\nhe expected that she would turn upon him with loud threatenings and\r\nprotestations as to her wrongs. But it was not so. When he entered\r\nthe room she was standing with her back to him, leaning on the\r\nmantel-piece, and at the first moment she did not essay to speak. He\r\nwalked into the middle of the room and stood there, waiting for her\r\nto begin.\r\n\r\n"Shut the door!" she said, looking over her shoulder. "I suppose you\r\ndon\'t want the girl to hear all you\'ve got to say to me!"\r\n\r\nThen he shut the door; but still Amelia stood with her back to him,\r\nleaning upon the mantel-piece.\r\n\r\nIt did not seem that he had much to say, for he remained perfectly\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n"Well!" said Amelia, after a long pause, and she then again looked\r\nover her shoulder. "Well, Mr. Eames!"\r\n\r\n"Jemima gave me your note, and so I\'ve come," said he.\r\n\r\n"And is this the way we meet!" she exclaimed, turning suddenly upon\r\nhim, and throwing her long black hair back over her shoulders. There\r\ncertainly was some beauty about her. Her eyes were large and bright,\r\nand her shoulders were well turned. She might have done as an\r\nartist\'s model for a Judith, but I doubt whether any man, looking\r\nwell into her face, could think that she would do well as a wife.\r\n"Oh, John, is it to be thus, after love such as ours?" And she\r\nclasped her hands together, and stood before him.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean," said Eames.\r\n\r\n"If you are engaged to marry L. D., tell me so at once. Be a man, and\r\nspeak out, sir."\r\n\r\n"No," said Eames; "I am not engaged to marry the lady to whom you\r\nallude."\r\n\r\n"On your honour?"\r\n\r\n"I won\'t have her spoken about. I\'m not going to marry her, and\r\nthat\'s enough."\r\n\r\n"Do you think that I wish to speak of her? What can L. D. be to me as\r\nlong as she is nothing to you? Oh, Johnny, why did you write me that\r\nheartless letter?" Then she leaned upon his shoulder--or attempted to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nI cannot say that Eames shook her off, seeing that he lacked the\r\ncourage to do so; but he shuffled his shoulder about so that the\r\nsupport was uneasy to her, and she was driven to stand erect again.\r\n"Why did you write that cruel letter?" she said again.\r\n\r\n"Because I thought it best, Amelia. What\'s a man to do with ninety\r\npounds a year, you know?"\r\n\r\n"But your mother allows you twenty."\r\n\r\n"And what\'s a man to do with a hundred and ten?"\r\n\r\n"Rising five pounds every year," said the well-informed Amelia. "Of\r\ncourse we should live here, with mamma, and you would just go on\r\npaying her as you do now. If your heart was right, Johnny, you\r\nwouldn\'t think so much about money. If you loved me--as you said you\r\ndid--" Then a little sob came, and the words were stopped. The words\r\nwere stopped, but she was again upon his shoulder. What was he to\r\ndo? In truth, his only wish was to escape, and yet his arm, quite in\r\nopposition to his own desires, found its way round her waist. In such\r\na combat a woman has so many points in her favour! "Oh, Johnny," she\r\nsaid again, as soon as she felt the pressure of his arm. "Gracious,\r\nwhat a beautiful watch you\'ve got," and she took the trinket out of\r\nhis pocket. "Did you buy that?"\r\n\r\n"No; it was given to me."\r\n\r\n"John Eames, did L. D. give it you?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, no," he shouted, stamping on the floor as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I beg your pardon," said Amelia, quelled for the moment by his\r\nenergy. "Perhaps it was your mother."\r\n\r\n"No; it was a man. Never mind about the watch now."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t mind anything, Johnny, if you would tell me that you\r\nloved me again. Perhaps I oughtn\'t to ask you, and it isn\'t becoming\r\nin a lady; but how can I help it, when you know you\'ve got my heart.\r\nCome upstairs and have tea with us now, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\nWhat was he to do? He said that he would go up and have tea; and\r\nas he led her to the door he put down his face and kissed her. Oh,\r\nJohnny Eames! But then a woman in such a contest has so many points\r\nin her favour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nIS IT FROM HIM?\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already declared that Crosbie wrote and posted the fatal\r\nletter to Allington, and we must now follow it down to that place.\r\nOn the morning following the squire\'s return to his own house, Mrs.\r\nCrump, the post-mistress at Allington, received a parcel by post\r\ndirected to herself. She opened it, and found an enclosure addressed\r\nto Mrs. Dale, with a written request that she would herself deliver\r\nit into that lady\'s own hand at once. This was Crosbie\'s letter.\r\n\r\n"It\'s from Miss Lily\'s gentleman," said Mrs. Crump, looking at the\r\nhandwriting. "There\'s something up, or he wouldn\'t be writing to her\r\nmamma in this way." But Mrs. Crump lost no time in putting on her\r\nbonnet, and trudging up with the letter to the Small House. "I must\r\nsee the missus herself," said Mrs. Crump. Whereupon Mrs. Dale was\r\ncalled downstairs into the hall, and there received the packet.\r\nLily was in the breakfast-parlour, and had seen the post-mistress\r\narrive;--had seen also that she carried a letter in her hand. For a\r\nmoment she had thought that it was for her, and imagined that the\r\nold woman had brought it herself from simple good-nature. But Lily,\r\nwhen she heard her mother mentioned, instantly withdrew and shut the\r\nparlour door. Her heart misgave her that something was wrong, but\r\nshe hardly tried to think what it might be. After all, the regular\r\npostman might bring the letter she herself expected. Bell was\r\nnot yet downstairs, and she stood alone over the tea-cups on the\r\nbreakfast-table, feeling that there was something for her to fear.\r\nHer mother did not come at once into the room, but, after a pause\r\nof a moment or two, went again upstairs. So she remained, either\r\nstanding against the table, or at the window, or seated in one of the\r\ntwo arm-chairs, for a space of ten minutes, when Bell entered the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t mamma down yet?" said Bell.\r\n\r\n"Bell," said Lily, "something has happened. Mamma has got a letter."\r\n\r\n"Happened! What has happened? Is anybody ill? Who is the letter\r\nfrom?" And Bell was going to return through the door in search of her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n"Stop, Bell," said Lily. "Do not go to her yet. I think it\'s\r\nfrom--Adolphus."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lily, what do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, dear. We\'ll wait a little longer. Don\'t look like\r\nthat, Bell." And Lily strove to appear calm, and strove almost\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\n"You have frightened me so," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"I am frightened myself. He only sent me one line yesterday, and now\r\nhe has sent nothing. If some misfortune should have happened to him!\r\nMrs. Crump brought down the letter herself to mamma, and that is so\r\nodd, you know."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure it was from him?"\r\n\r\n"No; I have not spoken to her. I will go up to her now. Don\'t you\r\ncome, Bell. Oh! Bell, do not look so unhappy." She then went over and\r\nkissed her sister, and after that, with very gentle steps, made her\r\nway up to her mother\'s room. "Mamma, may I come in?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Oh! my child!"\r\n\r\n"I know it is from him, mamma. Tell me all at once."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale had read the letter. With quick, glancing eyes, she had\r\nmade herself mistress of its whole contents, and was already aware\r\nof the nature and extent of the sorrow which had come upon them. It\r\nwas a sorrow that admitted of no hope. The man who had written that\r\nletter could never return again; nor if he should return could he be\r\nwelcomed back to them. The blow had fallen, and it was to be borne.\r\nInside the letter to herself had been a very small note addressed to\r\nLily. "Give her the enclosed," Crosbie had said in his letter, "if\r\nyou do not now think it wrong to do so. I have left it open, that you\r\nmay read it." Mrs. Dale, however, had not yet read it, and she now\r\nconcealed it beneath her handkerchief.\r\n\r\nI will not repeat at length Crosbie\'s letter to Mrs. Dale. It covered\r\nfour sides of letter-paper, and was such a letter that any man who\r\nwrote it must have felt himself to be a rascal. We saw that he had\r\ndifficulty in writing it, but the miracle was, that any man could\r\nhave found it possible to write it. "I know you will curse me," said\r\nhe; "and I deserve to be cursed. I know that I shall be punished\r\nfor this, and I must bear my punishment. My worst punishment will\r\nbe this,--that I never more shall hold up my head again." And then,\r\nagain, he said:--"My only excuse is my conviction that I should\r\nnever make her happy. She has been brought up as an angel, with pure\r\nthoughts, with holy hopes, with a belief in all that is good, and\r\nhigh, and noble. I have been surrounded through my whole life by\r\nthings low, and mean, and ignoble. How could I live with her, or she\r\nwith me? I know now that this is so; but my fault has been that I\r\ndid not know it when I was there with her. I choose to tell you all,"\r\nhe continued, towards the end of the letter, "and therefore I let you\r\nknow that I have engaged myself to marry another woman. Ah! I can\r\nforesee how bitter will be your feelings when you read this: but they\r\nwill not be so bitter as mine while I write it. Yes; I am already\r\nengaged to one who will suit me, and whom I may suit. You will not\r\nexpect me to speak ill of her who is to be near and dear to me. But\r\nshe is one with whom I may mate myself without an inward conviction\r\nthat I shall destroy all her happiness by doing so. Lilian," he said,\r\n"shall always have my prayers; and I trust that she may soon forget,\r\nin the love of an honest man, that she ever knew one so dishonest\r\nas--Adolphus Crosbie."\r\n\r\nOf what like must have been his countenance as he sat writing such\r\nwords of himself under the ghastly light of his own small, solitary\r\nlamp? Had he written his letter at his office, in the day-time, with\r\nmen coming in and out of his room, he could hardly have written of\r\nhimself so plainly. He would have bethought himself that the written\r\nwords might remain, and be read hereafter by other eyes than those\r\nfor which they were intended. But, as he sat alone, during the small\r\nhours of the night, almost repenting of his sin with true repentance,\r\nhe declared to himself that he did not care who might read them. They\r\nshould, at any rate, be true. Now they had been read by her to whom\r\nthey had been addressed, and the daughter was standing before the\r\nmother to hear her doom.\r\n\r\n"Tell me all at once," Lily had said; but in what words was her\r\nmother to tell her?\r\n\r\n"Lily," she said, rising from her seat, and leaving the two letters\r\non the couch; that addressed to the daughter was hidden beneath a\r\nhandkerchief, but that which she had read she left open and in sight.\r\nShe took both the girl\'s hands in hers as she looked into her face,\r\nand spoke to her. "Lily, my child!" Then she burst into sobs, and was\r\nunable to tell her tale.\r\n\r\n"Is it from him, mamma? May I read it? He cannot be--"\r\n\r\n"It is from Mr. Crosbie."\r\n\r\n"Is he ill, mamma? Tell me at once. If he is ill I will go to him."\r\n\r\n"No, my darling, he is not ill. Not yet;--do not read it yet. Oh,\r\nLily! It brings bad news; very bad news."\r\n\r\n"Mamma, if he is not in danger, I can read it. Is it bad to him, or\r\nonly bad to me?"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the servant knocked, and not waiting for an answer\r\nhalf opened the door.\r\n\r\n"If you please, ma\'am, Mr. Bernard is below, and wants to speak to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Bernard! ask Miss Bell to see him."\r\n\r\n"Miss Bell is with him, ma\'am, but he says that he specially wants to\r\nspeak to you."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale felt that she could not leave Lily alone. She could not\r\ntake the letter away, nor could she leave her child with the letter\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n"I cannot see him," said Mrs. Dale. "Ask him what it is. Tell him\r\nI cannot come down just at present." And then the servant went, and\r\nBernard left his message with Bell.\r\n\r\n"Bernard," she had said, "do you know of anything? Is there anything\r\nwrong about Mr. Crosbie?" Then, in a few words, he told her all, and\r\nunderstanding why his aunt had not come down to him, he went back\r\nto the Great House. Bell, almost stupefied by the tidings, seated\r\nherself at the table unconsciously, leaning upon her elbows.\r\n\r\n"It will kill her," she said to herself. "My Lily, my darling Lily!\r\nIt will surely kill her!"\r\n\r\nBut the mother was still with the daughter, and the story was still\r\nuntold.\r\n\r\n"Mamma," said Lily, "whatever it is, I must, of course, be made to\r\nknow it. I begin to guess the truth. It will pain you to say it.\r\nShall I read the letter?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale was astonished at her calmness. It could not be that\r\nshe had guessed the truth, or she would not stand like that, with\r\ntearless eyes and unquelled courage before her.\r\n\r\n"You shall read it, but I ought to tell you first. Oh, my child, my\r\nown one!" Lily was now leaning against the bed, and her mother was\r\nstanding over her, caressing her.\r\n\r\n"Then tell me," said she. "But I know what it is. He has thought it\r\nall over while away from me, and he finds that it must not be as we\r\nhave supposed. Before he went I offered to release him, and now he\r\nknows that he had better accept my offer. Is it so, mamma?" In answer\r\nto this Mrs. Dale did not speak, but Lily understood from her signs\r\nthat it was so.\r\n\r\n"He might have written it to me, myself," said Lily, very proudly.\r\n"Mamma, we will go down to breakfast. He has sent nothing to me,\r\nthen?"\r\n\r\n"There is a note. He bids me read it, but I have not opened it. It is\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"Give it me," said Lily, almost sternly. "Let me have his last words\r\nto me;" and she took the note from her mother\'s hands.\r\n\r\n"Lily," said the note, "your mother will have told you all. Before\r\nyou read these few words you will know that you have trusted one who\r\nwas quite untrustworthy. I know that you will hate me.--I cannot\r\neven ask you to forgive me. You will let me pray that you may yet be\r\nhappy.--A. C."\r\n\r\nShe read these few words, still leaning against the bed. Then she\r\ngot up, and walking to a chair, seated herself with her back to her\r\nmother. Mrs. Dale moving silently after her stood over the back of\r\nthe chair, not daring to speak to her. So she sat for some five\r\nminutes, with her eyes fixed upon the open window, and with Crosbie\'s\r\nnote in her hand.\r\n\r\n"I will not hate him, and I do forgive him," she said at last,\r\nstruggling to command her voice, and hardly showing that she could\r\nnot altogether succeed in her attempt. "I may not write to him\r\nagain, but you shall write and tell him so. Now we will go down to\r\nbreakfast." And so saying, she got up from her chair.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale almost feared to speak to her, her composure was so\r\ncomplete, and her manner so stern and fixed. She hardly knew how to\r\noffer pity and sympathy, seeing that pity seemed to be so little\r\nnecessary, and that even sympathy was not demanded. And she could not\r\nunderstand all that Lily had said. What had she meant by the offer to\r\nrelease him? Had there, then, been some quarrel between them before\r\nhe went? Crosbie had made no such allusion in his letter. But Mrs.\r\nDale did not dare to ask any questions.\r\n\r\n"You frighten me, Lily," she said. "Your very calmness frightens me."\r\n\r\n"Dear mamma!" and the poor girl absolutely smiled as she embraced her\r\nmother. "You need not be frightened by my calmness. I know the truth\r\nwell. I have been very unfortunate;--very. The brightest hopes of\r\nmy life are all gone;--and I shall never again see him whom I love\r\nbeyond all the world!" Then at last she broke down, and wept in her\r\nmother\'s arms.\r\n\r\nThere was not a word of anger spoken then against him who had done\r\nall this. Mrs. Dale felt that she did not dare to speak in anger\r\nagainst him, and words of anger were not likely to come from poor\r\nLily. She, indeed, hitherto did not know the whole of his offence,\r\nfor she had not read his letter.\r\n\r\n"Give it me, mamma," she said at last. "It has to be done sooner or\r\nlater."\r\n\r\n"Not now, Lily. I have told you all,--all that you need know at\r\npresent."\r\n\r\n"Yes; now, mamma," and again that sweet silvery voice became stern.\r\n"I will read it now, and there shall be an end." Whereupon Mrs. Dale\r\ngave her the letter and she read it in silence. Her mother, though\r\nstanding somewhat behind her, watched her narrowly as she did so. She\r\nwas now lying over upon the bed, and the letter was on the pillow, as\r\nshe propped herself upon her arm. Her tears were running, and ever\r\nand again she would stop to dry her eyes. Her sobs, too, were very\r\naudible, but she went on steadily with her reading till she came to\r\nthe line on which Crosbie told that he had already engaged himself\r\nto another woman. Then her mother could see that she paused suddenly,\r\nand that a shudder slightly convulsed all her limbs.\r\n\r\n"He has been very quick," she said, almost in a whisper; and then she\r\nfinished the letter. "Tell him, mamma," she said, "that I do forgive\r\nhim, and I will not hate him. You will tell him that,--from me; will\r\nyou not?" And then she raised herself from the bed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale would give her no such assurance. In her present mood her\r\nfeelings against Crosbie were of a nature which she herself hardly\r\ncould understand or analyze. She felt that if he were present she\r\ncould almost fly at him as would a tigress. She had never hated\r\nbefore as she now hated this man. He was to her a murderer, and worse\r\nthan a murderer. He had made his way like a wolf into her little\r\nfold, and torn her ewe-lamb and left her maimed and mutilated for\r\nlife. How could a mother forgive such an offence as that, or consent\r\nto be the medium through which forgiveness should be expressed?\r\n\r\n"You must, mamma; or, if you do not, I shall do so. Remember that I\r\nlove him. You know what it is to have loved one single man. He has\r\nmade me very unhappy; I hardly know yet how unhappy. But I have loved\r\nhim, and do love him. I believe, in my heart, that he still loves me.\r\nWhere this has been there must not be hatred and unforgiveness."\r\n\r\n"I will pray that I may become able to forgive him," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"But you must write to him those words. Indeed you must, mamma! \'She\r\nbids me tell you that she has forgiven you, and will not hate you.\'\r\nPromise me that!"\r\n\r\n"I can make no promise now, Lily. I will think about it, and\r\nendeavour to do my duty."\r\n\r\nLily was now seated, and was holding the skirt of her mother\'s dress.\r\n\r\n"Mamma," she said, looking up into her mother\'s face, "you must be\r\nvery good to me now; and I must be very good to you. We shall be\r\nalways together now. I must be your friend and counsellor; and be\r\neverything to you, more than ever. I must fall in love with you now;"\r\nand she smiled again, and the tears were almost dry upon her cheeks.\r\n\r\nAt last they went down to the breakfast-room, from which Bell had not\r\nmoved. Mrs. Dale entered the room first, and Lily followed, hiding\r\nherself for a moment behind her mother. Then she came forward boldly,\r\nand taking Bell in her arms, clasped her close to her bosom.\r\n\r\n"Bell," she said, "he has gone."\r\n\r\n"Lily! Lily! Lily!" said Bell, weeping.\r\n\r\n"He has gone! We shall talk it over in a few days, and shall know how\r\nto do so without losing ourselves in misery. To-day we will say no\r\nmore about it. I am so thirsty, Bell; do give me my tea;" and she sat\r\nherself down at the breakfast-table.\r\n\r\nLily\'s tea was given to her, and she drank it. Beyond that I cannot\r\nsay that any of them partook with much heartiness of the meal. They\r\nsat there, as they would have sat if no terrible thunderbolt had\r\nfallen among them, and no word further was spoken about Crosbie and\r\nhis conduct. Immediately after breakfast they went into the other\r\nroom, and Lily, as was her wont, sat herself immediately down to her\r\ndrawing. Her mother looked at her with wistful eyes, longing to bid\r\nher spare herself, but she shrank from interfering with her. For a\r\nquarter of an hour Lily sat over her board, with her brush or pencil\r\nin her hand, and then she rose up and put it away.\r\n\r\n"It is no good pretending," she said. "I am only spoiling the things;\r\nbut I will be better to-morrow. I\'ll go away and lie down by myself,\r\nmamma." And so she went.\r\n\r\nSoon after this Mrs. Dale took her bonnet and went up to the Great\r\nHouse, having received her brother-in-law\'s message from Bell.\r\n\r\n"I know what he has to tell me," she said; "but I might as well go.\r\nIt will be necessary that we should speak to each other about it." So\r\nshe walked across the lawn, and up into the hall of the Great House.\r\n"Is my brother in the book-room?" she said to one of the maids; and\r\nthen knocking at the door, went in unannounced.\r\n\r\nThe squire rose from his arm-chair, and came forward to meet her.\r\n\r\n"Mary," he said, "I believe you know it all."\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said. "You can read that," and she handed him Crosbie\'s\r\nletter. "How was one to know that any man could be so wicked as\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\n"And she has heard it?" asked the squire. "Is she able to bear it?"\r\n\r\n"Wonderfully! She has amazed me by her strength. It frightens me;\r\nfor I know that a relapse must come. She has never sunk for a moment\r\nbeneath it. For myself, I feel as though it were her strength that\r\nenables me to bear my share of it." And then she described to the\r\nsquire all that had taken place that morning.\r\n\r\n"Poor child!" said the squire. "Poor child! What can we do for her?\r\nWould it be good for her to go away for a time? She is a sweet,\r\ngood, lovely girl, and has deserved better than that. Sorrow and\r\ndisappointment come to us all; but they are doubly heavy when they\r\ncome so early."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale was almost surprised at the amount of sympathy which he\r\nshowed.\r\n\r\n"And what is to be his punishment?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"The scorn which men and women will feel for him; those, at least,\r\nwhose esteem or scorn are matters of concern to any one. I know no\r\nother punishment. You would not have Lily\'s name brought before a\r\ntribunal of law?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not that."\r\n\r\n"And I will not have Bernard calling him out. Indeed, it would be for\r\nnothing; for in these days a man is not expected to fight duels."\r\n\r\n"You cannot think that I would wish that."\r\n\r\n"What punishment is there, then? I know of none. There are evils\r\nwhich a man may do, and no one can punish him. I know of nothing. I\r\nwent up to London after him, but he contrived to crawl out of my way.\r\nWhat can you do to a rat but keep clear of him?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale had felt in her heart that it would be well if Crosbie\r\ncould be beaten till all his bones were sore. I hardly know whether\r\nsuch should have been a woman\'s thought, but it was hers. She had\r\nno wish that he should be made to fight a duel. In that there would\r\nhave been much that was wicked, and in her estimation nothing that\r\nwas just. But she felt that if Bernard would thrash the coward for\r\nhis cowardice she would love her nephew better than ever she had\r\nloved him. Bernard also had considered it probable that he might\r\nbe expected to horsewhip the man who had jilted his cousin, and,\r\nas regarded the absolute bodily risk, he would not have felt any\r\ninsuperable objection to undertake the task. But such a piece of work\r\nwas disagreeable to him in many ways. He hated the idea of a row at\r\nhis club. He was most desirous that his cousin\'s name should not be\r\nmade public. He wished to avoid anything that might be impolitic. A\r\nwicked thing had been done, and he was quite ready to hate Crosbie\r\nas Crosbie ought to be hated; but as regarded himself, it made him\r\nunhappy to think that the world might probably expect him to punish\r\nthe man who had so lately been his friend. And then he did not know\r\nwhere to catch him, or how to thrash him when caught. He was very\r\nsorry for his cousin, and felt strongly that Crosbie should not be\r\nallowed to escape. But what was he to do?\r\n\r\n"Would she like to go anywhere?" said the squire again, anxious, if\r\nhe could, to afford solace by some act of generosity. At this moment\r\nhe would have settled a hundred a year for life upon his niece if by\r\nso doing he could have done her any good.\r\n\r\n"She will be better at home," said Mrs. Dale. "Poor thing. For a\r\nwhile she will wish to avoid going out."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so;" and then there was a pause. "I\'ll tell you what,\r\nMary; I don\'t understand it. On my honour I don\'t understand it.\r\nIt is to me as wonderful as though I had caught the man picking my\r\npence out of my pocket. I don\'t think any man in the position of a\r\ngentleman would have done such a thing when I was young. I don\'t\r\nthink any man would have dared to do it. But now it seems that a\r\nman may act in that way and no harm come to him. He had a friend\r\nin London who came to me and talked about it as though it were\r\nsome ordinary, everyday transaction of life. Yes; you may come in,\r\nBernard. The poor child knows it all now."\r\n\r\nBernard offered to his aunt what of solace and sympathy he had to\r\noffer, and made some sort of half-expressed apology for having\r\nintroduced this wolf into their flock. "We always thought very much\r\nof him at his club," said Bernard.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know much about your London clubs now-a-days," said his\r\nuncle, "nor do I wish to do so if the society of that man can be\r\nendured after what he has now done."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose half-a-dozen men will ever know anything about it,"\r\nsaid Bernard.\r\n\r\n"Umph!" ejaculated the squire. He could not say that he wished\r\nCrosbie\'s villany to be widely discussed, seeing that Lily\'s name was\r\nso closely connected with it. But yet he could not support the idea\r\nthat Crosbie should not be punished by the frown of the world at\r\nlarge. It seemed to him that from this time forward any man speaking\r\nto Crosbie should be held to have disgraced himself by so doing.\r\n\r\n"Give her my best love," he said, as Mrs. Dale got up to take her\r\nleave; "my very best love. If her old uncle can do anything for her\r\nshe has only to let me know. She met the man in my house, and I feel\r\nthat I owe her much. Bid her come and see me. It will be better for\r\nher than moping at home. And Mary"--this he said to her, whispering\r\ninto her ear--"think of what I said to you about Bell."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale, as she walked back to her own house, acknowledged to\r\nherself that her brother-in-law\'s manner was different to her from\r\nanything that she had hitherto known of him.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of that day Crosbie\'s name was not mentioned at\r\nthe Small House. Neither of the girls stirred out, and Bell spent\r\nthe greater part of the afternoon sitting, with her arm round her\r\nsister\'s waist, upon the sofa. Each of them had a book; but though\r\nthere was little spoken, there was as little read. Who can describe\r\nthe thoughts that were passing through Lily\'s mind as she remembered\r\nthe hours which she had passed with Crosbie, of his warm assurances\r\nof love, of his accepted caresses, of her uncontrolled and\r\nacknowledged joy in his affection? It had all been holy to her then;\r\nand now those things which were then sacred had been made almost\r\ndisgraceful by his fault. And yet as she thought of this she declared\r\nto herself over and over again that she would forgive him;--nay, that\r\nshe had forgiven him. "And he shall know it, too," she said, speaking\r\nalmost out loud.\r\n\r\n"Lily, dear Lily," said Bell, "turn your thoughts away from it for a\r\nwhile, if you can."\r\n\r\n"They won\'t go away," said Lily. And that was all that was said\r\nbetween them on the subject.\r\n\r\nEverybody would know it! I doubt whether that must not be one of the\r\nbitterest drops in the cup which a girl in such circumstances is made\r\nto drain. Lily perceived early in the day that the parlour-maid well\r\nknew that she had been jilted. The girl\'s manner was intended to\r\nconvey sympathy; but it did convey pity; and Lily for a moment felt\r\nangry. But she remembered that it must be so, and smiled upon the\r\ngirl, and spoke kindly to her. What mattered it? All the world would\r\nknow it in a day or two.\r\n\r\nOn the following day she went up, by her mother\'s advice, to see her\r\nuncle.\r\n\r\n"My child," said he, "I am sorry for you. My heart bleeds for you."\r\n\r\n"Uncle," she said, "do not mind it. Only do this for me,--do not talk\r\nabout it,--I mean to me."\r\n\r\n"No, no; I will not. That there should ever have been in my house so\r\ngreat a rascal--"\r\n\r\n"Uncle! uncle! I will not have that! I will not listen to a word\r\nagainst him from any human being,--not a word! Remember that!" And\r\nher eyes flashed as she spoke.\r\n\r\nHe did not answer her, but took her hand and pressed it, and then she\r\nleft him. "The Dales were ever constant!" he said to himself, as he\r\nwalked up and down the terrace before his house. "Ever constant!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE WOUNDED FAWN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: (untitled)]\r\n\r\nNearly two months passed away, and it was now Christmas time at\r\nAllington. It may be presumed that there was no intention at either\r\nhouse that the mirth should be very loud. Such a wound as that\r\nreceived by Lily Dale was one from which recovery could not be quick,\r\nand it was felt by all the family that a weight was upon them which\r\nmade gaiety impracticable. As for Lily herself it may be said that\r\nshe bore her misfortune with all a woman\'s courage. For the first\r\nweek she stood up as a tree that stands against the wind, which\r\nis soon to be shivered to pieces because it will not bend. During\r\nthat week her mother and sister were frightened by her calmness and\r\nendurance. She would perform her daily task. She would go out through\r\nthe village, and appear at her place in church on the first Sunday.\r\nShe would sit over her book of an evening, keeping back her tears;\r\nand would chide her mother and sister when she found that they were\r\nregarding her with earnest anxiety.\r\n\r\n"Mamma, let it all be as though it had never been," she said.\r\n\r\n"Ah, dear! if that were but possible!"\r\n\r\n"God forbid that it should be possible inwardly," Lily replied, "but\r\nit is possible outwardly. I feel that you are more tender to me\r\nthan you used to be, and that upsets me. If you would only scold me\r\nbecause I am idle, I should soon be better." But her mother could not\r\nspeak to her as she perhaps might have spoken had no grief fallen\r\nupon her pet. She could not cease from those anxious tender glances\r\nwhich made Lily know that she was looked on as a fawn wounded almost\r\nto death.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first week she gave way. "I won\'t get up, Bell,"\r\nshe said one morning, almost petulantly. "I am ill;--I had better\r\nlie here out of the way. Don\'t make a fuss about it. I\'m stupid and\r\nfoolish, and that makes me ill."\r\n\r\nThereupon Mrs. Dale and Bell were frightened, and looked into each\r\nother\'s blank faces, remembering stories of poor broken-hearted girls\r\nwho had died because their loves had been unfortunate,--as small wax\r\ntapers whose lights are quenched if a breath of wind blows upon them\r\ntoo strongly. But then Lily was in truth no such slight taper as\r\nthat. Nor was she the stem that must be broken because it will not\r\nbend. She bent herself to the blast during that week of illness, and\r\nthen arose with her form still straight and graceful, and with her\r\nbright light unquenched.\r\n\r\nAfter that she would talk more openly to her mother about her\r\nloss,--openly and with a true appreciation of the misfortune which\r\nhad befallen her; but with an assurance of strength which seemed to\r\nridicule the idea of a broken heart. "I know that I can bear it," she\r\nsaid, "and that I can bear it without lasting unhappiness. Of course\r\nI shall always love him, and must feel almost as you felt when you\r\nlost my father."\r\n\r\nIn answer to this Mrs. Dale could say nothing. She could not speak\r\nout her thoughts about Crosbie, and explain to Lily that he was\r\nunworthy of her love. Love does not follow worth, and is not given\r\nto excellence;--nor is it destroyed by ill-usage, nor killed by blows\r\nand mutilation. When Lily declared that she still loved the man\r\nwho had so ill-used her, Mrs. Dale would be silent. Each perfectly\r\nunderstood the other, but on that matter even they could not\r\ninterchange their thoughts with freedom.\r\n\r\n"You must promise never to be tired of me, mamma," said Lily.\r\n\r\n"Mothers do not often get tired of their children, whatever the\r\nchildren may do of their mothers."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not so sure of that when the children turn out old maids. And I\r\nmean to have a will of my own, too, mamma; and a way also, if it be\r\npossible. When Bell is married I shall consider it a partnership, and\r\nI shan\'t do what I\'m told any longer."\r\n\r\n"Forewarned will be forearmed."\r\n\r\n"Exactly;--and I don\'t want to take you by surprise. For a year or\r\ntwo longer, till Bell is gone, I mean to be dutiful; but it would be\r\nvery stupid for a girl to be dutiful all her life."\r\n\r\nAll of which Mrs. Dale understood thoroughly. It amounted to an\r\nassertion on Lily\'s part that she had loved once and could never love\r\nagain; that she had played her game, hoping, as other girls hope,\r\nthat she might win the prize of a husband; but that, having lost, she\r\ncould never play the game again. It was that inward conviction on\r\nLily\'s part which made her say such words to her mother. But Mrs.\r\nDale would by no means allow herself to share this conviction. She\r\ndeclared to herself that time would cure Lily\'s wound, and that her\r\nchild might yet be crowned by the bliss of a happy marriage. She\r\nwould not in her heart consent to that plan in accordance with which\r\nLily\'s destiny in life was to be regarded as already fixed. She\r\nhad never really liked Crosbie as a suitor, and would herself have\r\npreferred John Eames, with all the faults of his hobbledehoyhood on\r\nhis head. It might yet come to pass that John Eames\' love might be\r\nmade happy.\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime Lily, as I have said, had become strong in her\r\ncourage, and recommenced the work of living with no lackadaisical\r\nself-assurance that because she had been made more unhappy than\r\nothers, therefore she should allow herself to be more idle. Morning\r\nand night she prayed for him, and daily, almost hour by hour, she\r\nassured herself that it was still her duty to love him. It was hard,\r\nthis duty of loving, without any power of expressing such love. But\r\nstill she would do her duty.\r\n\r\n"Tell me at once, mamma," she said one morning, "when you hear that\r\nthe day is fixed for his marriage. Pray don\'t keep me in the dark."\r\n\r\n"It is to be in February," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"But let me know the day. It must not be to me like ordinary days.\r\nBut do not look unhappy, mamma; I am not going to make a fool of\r\nmyself. I shan\'t steal off and appear in the church like a ghost."\r\nAnd then, having uttered her little joke, a sob came, and she hid her\r\nface on her mother\'s bosom. In a moment she raised it again. "Believe\r\nme, mamma, that I am not unhappy," she said.\r\n\r\nAfter the expiration of that second week Mrs. Dale did write a letter\r\nto Crosbie:\r\n\r\n\r\n   I suppose [she said] it is right that I should acknowledge\r\n   the receipt of your letter. I do not know that I have\r\n   aught else to say to you. It would not become me as a\r\n   woman to say what I think of your conduct, but I believe\r\n   that your conscience will tell you the same things. If it\r\n   do not, you must, indeed, be hardened. I have promised\r\n   my child that I will send to you a message from her. She\r\n   bids me tell you that she has forgiven you, and that she\r\n   does not hate you. May God also forgive you, and may you\r\n   recover his love.\r\n\r\n   MARY DALE.\r\n\r\n   I beg that no rejoinder may be made to this letter, either\r\n   to myself or to any of my family.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe squire wrote no answer to the letter which he had received, nor\r\ndid he take any steps towards the immediate punishment of Crosbie.\r\nIndeed he had declared that no such steps could be taken, explaining\r\nto his nephew that such a man could be served only as one serves a\r\nrat.\r\n\r\n"I shall never see him," he said once again; "if I did, I should not\r\nscruple to hit him on the head with my stick; but I should think ill\r\nof myself to go after him with such an object."\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was a terrible sorrow to the old man that the scoundrel\r\nwho had so injured him and his should escape scot-free. He had not\r\nforgiven Crosbie. No idea of forgiveness had ever crossed his mind.\r\nHe would have hated himself had he thought it possible that he\r\ncould be induced to forgive such an injury. "There is an amount of\r\nrascality in it,--of low meanness, which I do not understand," he\r\nwould say over and over again to his nephew. And then as he would\r\nwalk alone on the terrace he would speculate within his own mind\r\nwhether Bernard would take any steps towards avenging his cousin\'s\r\ninjury. "He is right," he would say to himself; "Bernard is quite\r\nright. But when I was young I could not have stood it. In those\r\ndays a gentleman might have a fellow out who had treated him as he\r\nhas treated us. A man was satisfied in feeling that he had done\r\nsomething. I suppose the world is different now-a-days." The world is\r\ndifferent; but the squire by no means acknowledged in his heart that\r\nthere had been any improvement.\r\n\r\nBernard also was greatly troubled in his mind. He would have had no\r\nobjection to fight a duel with Crosbie, had duels in these days been\r\npossible. But he believed them to be no longer possible,--at any rate\r\nwithout ridicule. And if he could not fight the man, in what other\r\nway was he to punish him? Was it not the fact that for such a fault\r\nthe world afforded no punishment? Was it not in the power of a man\r\nlike Crosbie to amuse himself for a week or two at the expense of\r\na girl\'s happiness for life, and then to escape absolutely without\r\nany ill effects to himself? "I shall be barred out of my club lest\r\nI should meet him," Bernard said to himself, "but he will not be\r\nbarred out." Moreover, there was a feeling within him that the matter\r\nwould be one of triumph to Crosbie rather than otherwise. In having\r\nsecured for himself the pleasure of his courtship with such a girl\r\nas Lily Dale, without encountering the penalty usually consequent\r\nupon such amusement, he would be held by many as having merited\r\nmuch admiration. He had sinned against all the Dales, and yet\r\nthe suffering arising from his sin was to fall upon the Dales\r\nexclusively. Such was Bernard\'s reasoning, as he speculated on the\r\nwhole affair, sadly enough,--wishing to be avenged, but not knowing\r\nwhere to look for vengeance. For myself I believe him to have been\r\naltogether wrong as to the light in which he supposed that Crosbie\'s\r\nfalsehood would be regarded by Crosbie\'s friends. Men will still talk\r\nof such things lightly, professing that all is fair in love as it\r\nis in war, and speaking almost with envy of the good fortunes of a\r\npractised deceiver. But I have never come across the man who thought\r\nin this way with reference to an individual case. Crosbie\'s own\r\njudgment as to the consequences to himself of what he had done was\r\nmore correct than that formed by Bernard Dale. He had regarded the\r\nact as venial as long as it was still to do,--while it was still\r\nwithin his power to leave it undone; but from the moment of its\r\naccomplishment it had forced itself upon his own view in its proper\r\nlight. He knew that he had been a scoundrel, and he knew that other\r\nmen would so think of him. His friend Fowler Pratt, who had the\r\nreputation of looking at women simply as toys, had so regarded him.\r\nInstead of boasting of what he had done, he was as afraid of alluding\r\nto any matter connected with his marriage as a man is of talking of\r\nthe articles which he has stolen. He had already felt that men at his\r\nclub looked askance at him; and, though he was no coward as regarded\r\nhis own skin and bones, he had an undefined fear lest some day he\r\nmight encounter Bernard Dale purposely armed with a stick. The squire\r\nand his nephew were wrong in supposing that Crosbie was unpunished.\r\n\r\nAnd as the winter came on he felt that he was closely watched by the\r\nnoble family of De Courcy. Some of that noble family he had already\r\nlearned to hate cordially. The Honourable John came up to town in\r\nNovember, and persecuted him vilely;--insisted on having dinners\r\ngiven to him at Sebright\'s, of smoking throughout the whole afternoon\r\nin his future brother-in-law\'s rooms, and on borrowing his future\r\nbrother-in-law\'s possessions; till at last Crosbie determined that it\r\nwould be wise to quarrel with the Honourable John,--and he quarrelled\r\nwith him accordingly, turning him out of his rooms, and telling him\r\nin so many words that he would have no more to do with him.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to do it, as I did," Mortimer Gazebee had said to him;\r\n"I didn\'t like it because of the family, but Lady Amelia told me\r\nthat it must be so." Whereupon Crosbie took the advice of Mortimer\r\nGazebee.\r\n\r\nBut the hospitality of the Gazebees was perhaps more distressing to\r\nhim than even the importunities of the Honourable John. It seemed\r\nas though his future sister-in-law was determined not to leave him\r\nalone. Mortimer was sent to fetch him up for the Sunday afternoons,\r\nand he found that he was constrained to go to the villa in St. John\'s\r\nWood, even in opposition to his own most strenuous will. He could\r\nnot quite analyze the circumstances of his own position, but he felt\r\nas though he were a cock with his spurs cut off,--as a dog with his\r\nteeth drawn. He found himself becoming humble and meek. He had to\r\nacknowledge to himself that he was afraid of Lady Amelia, and almost\r\neven afraid of Mortimer Gazebee. He was aware that they watched him,\r\nand knew all his goings out and comings in. They called him Adolphus,\r\nand made him tame. That coming evil day in February was dinned into\r\nhis ears. Lady Amelia would go and look at furniture for him, and\r\ntalked by the hour about bedding and sheets. "You had better get your\r\nkitchen things at Tomkins\'. They\'re all good, and he\'ll give you ten\r\nper cent. off if you pay him ready money,--which of course you will,\r\nyou know!" Was it for this that he had sacrificed Lily Dale?--for\r\nthis that he had allied himself with the noble house of De Courcy?\r\n\r\nMortimer had been at him about the settlements from the very first\r\nmoment of his return to London, and had already bound him up hand and\r\nfoot. His life was insured, and the policy was in Mortimer\'s hands.\r\nHis own little bit of money had been already handed over to be tied\r\nup with Lady Alexandrina\'s little bit. It seemed to him that in\r\nall the arrangements made the intention was that he should die off\r\nspeedily, and that Lady Alexandrina should be provided with a decent\r\nlittle income, sufficient for St. John\'s Wood. Things were to be so\r\nsettled that he could not even spend the proceeds of his own money,\r\nor of hers. They were to go, under the fostering hand of Mortimer\r\nGazebee, in paying insurances. If he would only die the day after\r\nhis marriage, there would really be a very nice sum of money for\r\nAlexandrina, almost worthy of the acceptance of an earl\'s daughter.\r\nSix months ago he would have considered himself able to turn Mortimer\r\nGazebee round his finger on any subject that could be introduced\r\nbetween them. When they chanced to meet Gazebee had been quite humble\r\nto him, treating him almost as a superior being. He had looked down\r\non Gazebee from a very great height. But now it seemed as though he\r\nwere powerless in this man\'s hands.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the countess had become his greatest aversion. She\r\nwas perpetually writing to him little notes in which she gave him\r\nmultitudes of commissions, sending him about as though he had been\r\nher servant. And she pestered him with advice which was even worse\r\nthan her commissions, telling him of the style of life in which\r\nAlexandrina would expect to live, and warning him very frequently\r\nthat such an one as he could not expect to be admitted within the\r\nbosom of so noble a family without paying very dearly for that\r\ninestimable privilege. Her letters had become odious to him, and\r\nhe would chuck them on one side, leaving them for the whole day\r\nunopened. He had already made up his mind that he would quarrel with\r\nthe countess also, very shortly after his marriage; indeed, that he\r\nwould separate himself from the whole family if it were possible.\r\nAnd yet he had entered into this engagement mainly with the view\r\nof reaping those advantages which would accrue to him from being\r\nallied to the De Courcys! The squire and his nephew were wretched\r\nin thinking that this man was escaping without punishment, but they\r\nmight have spared themselves that misery.\r\n\r\nIt had been understood from the first that he was to spend his\r\nChristmas at Courcy Castle. From this undertaking it was quite out\r\nof his power to enfranchise himself: but he resolved that his visit\r\nshould be as short as possible. Christmas Day unfortunately came on\r\na Monday, and it was known to the De Courcy world that Saturday was\r\nalmost a _dies non_ at the General Committee Office. As to those\r\nthree days there was no escape for him; but he made Alexandrina\r\nunderstand that the three Commissioners were men of iron as to any\r\nextension of those three days. "I must be absent again in February,\r\nof course," he said, almost making his wail audible in the words he\r\nused, "and therefore it is quite impossible that I should stay now\r\nbeyond the Monday." Had there been attractions for him at Courcy\r\nCastle I think he might have arranged with Mr. Optimist for a week or\r\nten days. "We shall be all alone," the countess wrote to him, "and I\r\nhope you will have an opportunity of learning more of our ways than\r\nyou have ever really been able to do as yet." This was bitter as gall\r\nto him. But in this world all valuable commodities have their price;\r\nand when men such as Crosbie aspire to obtain for themselves an\r\nalliance with noble families, they must pay the market price for the\r\narticle which they purchase.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll all come up and dine with us on Monday," the squire said to\r\nMrs. Dale, about the middle of the previous week.\r\n\r\n"Well, I think not," said Mrs. Dale; "we are better, perhaps, as we\r\nare."\r\n\r\nAt this moment the squire and his sister-in-law were on much more\r\nfriendly terms than had been usual with them, and he took her reply\r\nin good part, understanding her feeling. Therefore, he pressed his\r\nrequest, and succeeded.\r\n\r\n"I think you\'re wrong," he said; "I don\'t suppose that we shall have\r\na very merry Christmas. You and the girls will hardly have that\r\nwhether you eat your pudding here or at the Great House. But it will\r\nbe better for us all to make the attempt. It\'s the right thing to do.\r\nThat\'s the way I look at it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll ask Lily," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"Do, do. Give her my love, and tell her from me that, in spite of all\r\nthat has come and gone, Christmas Day should still be to her a day of\r\nrejoicing. We\'ll dine about three, so that the servants can have the\r\nafternoon."\r\n\r\n"Of course we\'ll go," said Lily; "why not? We always do. And we\'ll\r\nhave blind-man\'s-buff with all the Boyces, as we had last year, if\r\nuncle will ask them up." But the Boyces were not asked up for that\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nBut Lily, though she put on it all so brave a face, had much to\r\nsuffer, and did in truth suffer greatly. If you, my reader, ever\r\nchanced to slip into the gutter on a wet day, did you not find that\r\nthe sympathy of the bystanders was by far the severest part of your\r\nmisfortune? Did you not declare to yourself that all might yet be\r\nwell, if the people would only walk on and not look at you? And yet\r\nyou cannot blame those who stood and pitied you; or, perhaps, essayed\r\nto rub you down, and assist you in the recovery of your bedaubed\r\nhat. You, yourself, if you see a man fall, cannot walk by as though\r\nnothing uncommon had happened to him. It was so with Lily. The people\r\nof Allington could not regard her with their ordinary eyes. They\r\nwould look at her tenderly, knowing that she was a wounded fawn,\r\nand thus they aggravated the soreness of her wound. Old Mrs. Hearn\r\ncondoled with her, telling her that very likely she would be better\r\noff as she was. Lily would not lie about it in any way. "Mrs. Hearn,"\r\nshe said, "the subject is painful to me." Mrs. Hearn said no more\r\nabout it, but on every meeting between them she looked the things she\r\ndid not say. "Miss Lily!" said Hopkins, one day, "Miss Lily!"--and\r\nas he looked up into her face a tear had almost formed itself in his\r\nold eye--"I knew what he was from the first. Oh, dear! oh, dear! if\r\nI could have had him killed!" "Hopkins, how dare you?" said Lily.\r\n"If you speak to me again in such a way, I will tell my uncle." She\r\nturned away from him; but immediately turned back again, and put out\r\nher little hand to him. "I beg your pardon," she said. "I know how\r\nkind you are, and I love you for it." And then she went away. "I\'ll\r\ngo after him yet, and break the dirty neck of him," said Hopkins to\r\nhimself, as he walked down the path.\r\n\r\nShortly before Christmas Day she called with her sister at the\r\nvicarage. Bell, in the course of the visit, left the room with one of\r\nthe Boyce girls, to look at the last chrysanthemums of the year. Then\r\nMrs. Boyce took advantage of the occasion to make her little speech.\r\n"My dear Lily," she said, "you will think me cold if I do not say one\r\nword to you." "No, I shall not," said Lily, almost sharply, shrinking\r\nfrom the finger that threatened to touch her sore. "There are things\r\nwhich should never be talked about." "Well, well; perhaps so," said\r\nMrs. Boyce. But for a minute or two she was unable to fall back upon\r\nany other topic, and sat looking at Lily with painful tenderness. I\r\nneed hardly say what were Lily\'s sufferings under such a gaze; but\r\nshe bore it, acknowledging to herself in her misery that the fault\r\ndid not lie with Mrs. Boyce. How could Mrs. Boyce have looked at her\r\notherwise than tenderly?\r\n\r\nIt was settled, then, that Lily was to dine up at the Great House on\r\nChristmas Day, and thus show to the Allington world that she was not\r\nto be regarded as a person shut out from the world by the depth of\r\nher misfortune. That she was right there can, I think, be no doubt;\r\nbut as she walked across the little bridge, with her mother and\r\nsister, after returning from church, she would have given much to be\r\nable to have turned round, and have gone to bed instead of to her\r\nuncle\'s dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nPAWKINS\'S IN JERMYN STREET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe show of fat beasts in London took place this year on the\r\ntwentieth day of December, and I have always understood that a\r\ncertain bullock exhibited by Lord De Guest was declared by the\r\nmetropolitan butchers to have realized all the possible excellences\r\nof breeding, feeding, and condition. No doubt the butchers of the\r\nnext half-century will have learned much better, and the Guestwick\r\nbeast, could it be embalmed and then produced, would excite only\r\nridicule at the agricultural ignorance of the present age; but Lord\r\nDe Guest took the praise that was offered to him, and found himself\r\nin a seventh heaven of delight. He was never so happy as when\r\nsurrounded by butchers, graziers, and salesmen who were able to\r\nappreciate the work of his life, and who regarded him as a model\r\nnobleman. "Look at that fellow," he said to Eames, pointing to the\r\nprize bullock. Eames had joined his patron at the show after his\r\noffice hours, looking on upon the living beef by gaslight. "Isn\'t he\r\nlike his sire? He was got by Lambkin, you know."\r\n\r\n"Lambkin," said Johnny, who had not as yet been able to learn much\r\nabout the Guestwick stock.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Lambkin. The bull that we had the trouble with. He has just got\r\nhis sire\'s back and fore-quarters. Don\'t you see?"\r\n\r\n"I daresay," said Johnny, who looked very hard, but could not see.\r\n\r\n"It\'s very odd," exclaimed the earl, "but do you know, that bull has\r\nbeen as quiet since that day,--as quiet as--as anything. I think it\r\nmust have been my pocket-handkerchief."\r\n\r\n"I daresay it was," said Johnny;--"or perhaps the flies."\r\n\r\n"Flies!" said the earl, angrily. "Do you suppose he isn\'t used to\r\nflies? Come away. I ordered dinner at seven, and it\'s past six now.\r\nMy brother-in-law, Colonel Dale, is up in town, and he dines with\r\nus." So he took Johnny\'s arm, and led him off through the show,\r\ncalling his attention as he went to several beasts which were\r\ninferior to his own.\r\n\r\nAnd then they walked down through Portman Square and Grosvenor\r\nSquare, and across Piccadilly to Jermyn Street. John Eames\r\nacknowledged to himself that it was odd that he should have an earl\r\nleaning on his arm as he passed along through the streets. At home,\r\nin his own life, his daily companions were Cradell and Amelia Roper,\r\nMrs. Lupex and Mrs. Roper. The difference was very great, and yet he\r\nfound it quite as easy to talk to the earl as to Mrs. Lupex.\r\n\r\n"You know the Dales down at Allington, of course," said the earl.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I know them."\r\n\r\n"But, perhaps, you never met the colonel."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I ever did."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a queer sort of fellow;--very well in his way, but he never\r\ndoes anything. He and my sister live at Torquay, and as far as I\r\ncan find out, they neither of them have any occupation of any sort.\r\nHe\'s come up to town now because we both had to meet our family\r\nlawyers and sign some papers, but he looks on the journey as a great\r\nhardship. As for me, I\'m a year older than he is, but I wouldn\'t mind\r\ngoing up and down from Guestwick every day."\r\n\r\n"It\'s looking after the bull that does it," said Eames.\r\n\r\n"By George! you\'re right, Master Johnny. My sister and Crofts may\r\ntell me what they like, but when a man\'s out in the open air for\r\neight or nine hours every day, it doesn\'t much matter where he goes\r\nto sleep after that. This is Pawkins\'s,--capital good house, but not\r\nso good as it used to be while old Pawkins was alive. Show Mr. Eames\r\nup into a bedroom to wash his hands."\r\n\r\nColonel Dale was much like his brother in face, but was taller, even\r\nthinner, and apparently older. When Eames went into the sitting-room,\r\nthe colonel was there alone, and had to take upon himself the trouble\r\nof introducing himself. He did not get up from his arm-chair, but\r\nnodded gently at the young man. "Mr. Eames, I believe? I knew your\r\nfather at Guestwick, a great many years ago;" then he turned his face\r\nback towards the fire and sighed.\r\n\r\n"It\'s got very cold this afternoon," said Johnny, trying to make\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n"It\'s always cold in London," said the colonel.\r\n\r\n"If you had to be here in August you wouldn\'t say so."\r\n\r\n"God forbid," said the colonel, and he sighed again, with his eyes\r\nfixed upon the fire. Eames had heard of the very gallant way in which\r\nOrlando Dale had persisted in running away with Lord De Guest\'s\r\nsister, in opposition to very terrible obstacles, and as he now\r\nlooked at the intrepid lover, he thought that there must have been a\r\ngreat change since those days. After that nothing more was said till\r\nthe earl came down.\r\n\r\nPawkins\'s house was thoroughly old-fashioned in all things, and the\r\nPawkins of that day himself stood behind the earl\'s elbow when the\r\ndinner began, and himself removed the cover from the soup tureen.\r\nLord De Guest did not require much personal attention, but he would\r\nhave felt annoyed if this hadn\'t been done. As it was he had a civil\r\nword to say to Pawkins about the fat cattle, thereby showing that he\r\ndid not mistake Pawkins for one of the waiters. Pawkins then took his\r\nlordship\'s orders about the wine and retired.\r\n\r\n"He keeps up the old house pretty well," said the earl to his\r\nbrother-in-law. "It isn\'t like what it was thirty years ago, but then\r\neverything of that sort has got worse and worse."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it has," said the colonel.\r\n\r\n"I remember when old Pawkins had as good a glass of port as I\'ve got\r\nat home,--or nearly. They can\'t get it now, you know."\r\n\r\n"I never drink port," said the colonel. "I seldom take anything after\r\ndinner, except a little negus."\r\n\r\nHis brother-in-law said nothing, but made a most eloquent grimace as\r\nhe turned his face towards his soup-plate. Eames saw it, and could\r\nhardly refrain from laughing. When, at half-past nine o\'clock, the\r\ncolonel retired from the room, the earl, as the door was closed,\r\nthrew up his hands, and uttered the one word "negus!" Then Eames took\r\nheart of grace and had his laughter out.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was very dull, and before the colonel went to bed Johnny\r\nregretted that he had been induced to dine at Pawkins\'s. It might be\r\na very fine thing to be asked to dinner with an earl, and John Eames\r\nhad perhaps received at his office some little accession of dignity\r\nfrom the circumstance, of which he had been not unpleasantly aware;\r\nbut, as he sat at the table, on which there were four or five apples\r\nand a plate of dried nuts, looking at the earl, as he endeavoured to\r\nkeep his eyes open, and at the colonel, to whom it seemed absolutely\r\na matter of indifference whether his companions were asleep or awake,\r\nhe confessed to himself that the price he was paying was almost\r\ntoo dear. Mrs. Roper\'s tea-table was not pleasant to him, but even\r\nthat would have been preferable to the black dinginess of Pawkins\'s\r\nmahogany, with the company of two tired old men, with whom he seemed\r\nto have no mutual subject of conversation. Once or twice he tried a\r\nword with the colonel, for the colonel sat with his eyes open looking\r\nat the fire. But he was answered with monosyllables, and it was\r\nevident to him that the colonel did not wish to talk. To sit still,\r\nwith his hands closed over each other on his lap, was work enough for\r\nColonel Dale during his after-dinner hours.\r\n\r\nBut the earl knew what was going on. During that terrible conflict\r\nbetween him and his slumber, in which the drowsy god fairly\r\nvanquished him for some twenty minutes, his conscience was always\r\naccusing him of treating his guests badly. He was very angry with\r\nhimself, and tried to arouse himself and talk. But his brother-in-law\r\nwould not help him in his efforts; and even Eames was not bright in\r\nrendering him assistance. Then for twenty minutes he slept soundly,\r\nand at the end of that he woke himself with one of his own snorts.\r\n"By George!" he said, jumping up and standing on the rug, "we\'ll have\r\nsome coffee;" and after that he did not sleep any more.\r\n\r\n"Dale," said he, "won\'t you take some more wine?"\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: "Won\'t you take some more wine?"]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Nothing more," said the colonel, still looking at the fire, and\r\nshaking his head very slowly.\r\n\r\n"Come, Johnny, fill your glass." He had already got into the way\r\nof calling his young friend Johnny, having found that Mrs. Eames\r\ngenerally spoke of her son by that name.\r\n\r\n"I have been filling my glass all the time," said Eames, taking the\r\ndecanter again in his hand as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you\'ve found something to amuse you, for it has seemed to\r\nme that you and Dale haven\'t had much to say to each other. I\'ve been\r\nlistening all the time."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been asleep," said the colonel.\r\n\r\n"Then there\'s been some excuse for my holding my tongue," said the\r\nearl. "By-the-by, Dale, what do you think of that fellow Crosbie?"\r\n\r\nEames\' ears were instantly on the alert, and the spirit of dullness\r\nvanished from him.\r\n\r\n"Think of him?" said the colonel.\r\n\r\n"He ought to have every bone in his skin broken," said the earl.\r\n\r\n"So he ought," said Eames, getting up from his chair in his\r\neagerness, and speaking in a tone somewhat louder than was perhaps\r\nbecoming in the presence of his seniors. "So he ought, my lord. He is\r\nthe most abominable rascal that ever I met in my life. I wish I was\r\nLily Dale\'s brother." Then he sat down again, remembering that he\r\nwas speaking in the presence of Lily\'s uncle, and of the father of\r\nBernard Dale, who might be supposed to occupy the place of Lily\'s\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nThe colonel turned his head round, and looked at the young man with\r\nsurprise. "I beg your pardon, sir," said Eames, "but I have known\r\nMrs. Dale and your nieces all my life."\r\n\r\n"Oh, have you?" said the colonel. "Nevertheless it is, perhaps, as\r\nwell not to make too free with a young lady\'s name. Not that I blame\r\nyou in the least, Mr. Eames."\r\n\r\n"I should think not," said the earl. "I honour him for his feeling.\r\nJohnny, my boy, if ever I am unfortunate enough to meet that man,\r\nI shall tell him my mind, and I believe you will do the same." On\r\nhearing this John Eames winked at the earl, and made a motion with\r\nhis head towards the colonel, whose back was turned to him. And then\r\nthe earl winked back at Eames.\r\n\r\n"De Guest," said the colonel, "I think I\'ll go upstairs; I always\r\nhave a little arrowroot in my own room."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll ring the bell for a candle," said the host. Then the colonel\r\nwent, and as the door was closed behind him, the earl raised his two\r\nhands and uttered that single word, "negus!" Whereupon Johnny burst\r\nout laughing, and coming round to the fire, sat himself down in the\r\narm-chair which the colonel had left.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no doubt it\'s all right," said the earl; "but I shouldn\'t like\r\nto drink negus myself, nor yet to have arrowroot up in my bedroom."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose there\'s any harm in it."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no; I wonder what Pawkins says about him. But I suppose\r\nthey have them of all sorts in an hotel."\r\n\r\n"The waiter didn\'t seem to think much of it when he brought it."\r\n\r\n"No, no. If he\'d asked for senna and salts, the waiter wouldn\'t have\r\nshowed any surprise. By-the-by, you touched him up about that poor\r\ngirl."\r\n\r\n"Did I, my lord? I didn\'t mean it."\r\n\r\n"You see he\'s Bernard Dale\'s father, and the question is, whether\r\nBernard shouldn\'t punish the fellow for what he has done. Somebody\r\nought to do it. It isn\'t right that he should escape. Somebody ought\r\nto let Mr. Crosbie know what a scoundrel he has made himself."\r\n\r\n"I\'d do it to-morrow, only I\'m afraid--"\r\n\r\n"No, no, no," said the earl; "you are not the right person at all.\r\nWhat have you got to do with it? You\'ve merely known them as family\r\nfriends, but that\'s not enough."\r\n\r\n"No, I suppose not," said Eames, sadly.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it\'s best as it is," said the earl. "I don\'t know that any\r\ngood would be got by knocking him over the head. And if we are to be\r\nChristians, I suppose we ought to be Christians."\r\n\r\n"What sort of a Christian has he been?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s true enough; and if I was Bernard, I should be very apt to\r\nforget my Bible lessons about meekness."\r\n\r\n"Do you know, my lord, I should think it the most Christian thing in\r\nthe world to pitch into him; I should, indeed. There are some things\r\nfor which a man ought to be beaten black and blue."\r\n\r\n"So that he shouldn\'t do them again?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly. You might say it isn\'t Christian to hang a man."\r\n\r\n"I\'d always hang a murderer. It wasn\'t right to hang men for stealing\r\nsheep."\r\n\r\n"Much better hang such a fellow as Crosbie," said Eames.\r\n\r\n"Well, I believe so. If any fellow wanted now to curry favour with\r\nthe young lady, what an opportunity he\'d have."\r\n\r\nJohnny remained silent for a moment or two before he answered. "I\'m\r\nnot so sure of that," he said, mournfully, as though grieving at the\r\nthought that there was no chance of currying favour with Lily by\r\nthrashing her late lover.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t pretend to know much about girls," said Lord De Guest; "but\r\nI should think it would be so. I should fancy that nothing would\r\nplease her so much as hearing that he had caught it, and that all the\r\nworld knew that he\'d caught it." The earl had declared that he didn\'t\r\nknow much about girls, and in so saying, he was no doubt right.\r\n\r\n"If I thought so," said Eames, "I\'d find him out to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Why so? what difference does it make to you?" Then there was another\r\npause, during which Johnny looked very sheepish. "You don\'t mean to\r\nsay that you\'re in love with Miss Lily Dale?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know much about being in love with her," said Johnny,\r\nturning very red as he spoke. And then he made up his mind, in a wild\r\nsort of way, to tell all the truth to his friend. Pawkins\'s port wine\r\nmay, perhaps, have had something to do with the resolution. "But I\'d\r\ngo through fire and water for her, my lord. I knew her years before\r\nhe had ever seen her, and have loved her a great deal better than he\r\nwill ever love any one. When I heard that she had accepted him, I had\r\nhalf a mind to cut my own throat,--or else his."\r\n\r\n"Highty tighty," said the earl.\r\n\r\n"It\'s very ridiculous, I know," said Johnny, "and of course she would\r\nnever have accepted me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that at all."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t a shilling in the world."\r\n\r\n"Girls don\'t care much for that."\r\n\r\n"And then a clerk in the Income-tax Office! It\'s such a poor thing."\r\n\r\n"The other fellow was only a clerk in another office."\r\n\r\nThe earl living down at Guestwick did not understand that the\r\nIncome-tax Office in the city, and the General Committee Office at\r\nWhitehall, were as far apart as Dives and Lazarus, and separated by\r\nas impassable a gulf.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said Johnny; "but his office is another kind of thing, and\r\nthen he was a swell himself."\r\n\r\n"By George, I don\'t see it," said the earl.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wonder a bit at her accepting a fellow like that. I hated\r\nhim the first moment I saw him; but that\'s no reason she should hate\r\nhim. He had that sort of manner, you know. He was a swell, and girls\r\nlike that kind of thing. I never felt angry with her, but I could\r\nhave eaten him." As he spoke he looked as though he would have made\r\nsome such attempt had Crosbie been present.\r\n\r\n"Did you ever ask her to have you?" said the earl.\r\n\r\n"No; how could I ask her, when I hadn\'t bread to give her?"\r\n\r\n"And you never told her--that you were in love with her, I mean, and\r\nall that kind of thing."\r\n\r\n"She knows it now," said Johnny; "I went to say good-by to her the\r\nother day,--when I thought she was going to be married. I could not\r\nhelp telling her then."\r\n\r\n"But it seems to me, my dear fellow, that you ought to be very much\r\nobliged to Crosbie;--that is to say, if you\'ve a mind to--"\r\n\r\n"I know what you mean, my lord. I am not a bit obliged to him. It\'s\r\nmy belief that all this will about kill her. As to myself, if I\r\nthought she\'d ever have me--"\r\n\r\nThen he was again silent, and the earl could see that the tears were\r\nin his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I think I begin to understand it," said the earl, "and I\'ll give you\r\na bit of advice. You come down and spend your Christmas with me at\r\nGuestwick."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my lord!"\r\n\r\n"Never mind my-lording me, but do as I tell you. Lady Julia sent you\r\na message, though I forgot all about it till now. She wants to thank\r\nyou herself for what you did in the field."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all nonsense, my lord."\r\n\r\n"Very well; you can tell her so. You may take my word for this,\r\ntoo,--my sister hates Crosbie quite as much as you do. I think she\'d\r\n\'pitch into him,\' as you call it, herself, if she knew how. You come\r\ndown to Guestwick for the Christmas, and then go over to Allington\r\nand tell them all plainly what you mean."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t say a word to her now."\r\n\r\n"Say it to the squire, then. Go to him, and tell him what you\r\nmean,--holding your head up like a man. Don\'t talk to me about\r\nswells. The man who means honestly is the best swell I know. He\'s\r\nthe only swell I recognize. Go to old Dale, and say you come from\r\nme,--from Guestwick Manor. Tell him that if he\'ll put a little\r\nstick under the pot to make it boil, I\'ll put a bigger one. He\'ll\r\nunderstand what that means."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, my lord."\r\n\r\n"But I say, oh, yes;" and the earl, who was now standing on the rug\r\nbefore the fire, dug his hands deep down into his trousers\' pockets.\r\n"I\'m very fond of that girl, and would do much for her. You ask Lady\r\nJulia if I didn\'t say so to her before I ever knew of your casting\r\na sheep\'s-eye that way. And I\'ve a sneaking kindness for you too,\r\nMaster Johnny. Lord bless you, I knew your father as well as I ever\r\nknew any man; and to tell the truth, I believe I helped to ruin him.\r\nHe held land of me, you know, and there can\'t be any doubt that\r\nhe did ruin himself. He knew no more about a beast when he\'d done,\r\nthan--than--than that waiter. If he\'d gone on to this day he wouldn\'t\r\nhave been any wiser."\r\n\r\nJohnny sat silent, with his eyes full of tears. What was he to say to\r\nhis friend?\r\n\r\n"You come down with me," continued the earl, "and you\'ll find we\'ll\r\nmake it all straight. I daresay you\'re right about not speaking to\r\nthe girl just at present. But tell everything to the uncle, and then\r\nto the mother. And, above all things, never think that you\'re not\r\ngood enough yourself. A man should never think that. My belief is\r\nthat in life people will take you very much at your own reckoning. If\r\nyou are made of dirt, like that fellow Crosbie, you\'ll be found out\r\nat last, no doubt. But then I don\'t think you are made of dirt."\r\n\r\n"I hope not."\r\n\r\n"And so do I. You can come down, I suppose, with me the day after\r\nto-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not. I have had all my leave."\r\n\r\n"Shall I write to old Buffle, and ask it as a favour?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Johnny; "I shouldn\'t like that. But I\'ll see to-morrow,\r\nand then I\'ll let you know. I can go down by the mail train on\r\nSaturday, at any rate."\r\n\r\n"That won\'t be comfortable. See and come with me if you can. Now,\r\ngood-night, my dear fellow, and remember this,--when I say a thing\r\nI mean it. I think I may boast that I never yet went back from my\r\nword."\r\n\r\nThe earl as he spoke gave his left hand to his guest, and looking\r\nsomewhat grandly up over the young man\'s head, he tapped his own\r\nbreast thrice with his right hand. As he went through the little\r\nscene, John Eames felt that he was every inch an earl.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what to say to you, my lord."\r\n\r\n"Say nothing,--not a word more to me. But say to yourself that faint\r\nheart never won fair lady. Good-night, my dear boy, good-night. I\r\ndine out to-morrow, but you can call and let me know at about six."\r\n\r\nEames then left the room without another word, and walked out into\r\nthe cold air of Jermyn Street. The moon was clear and bright, and\r\nthe pavement in the shining light seemed to be as clean as a lady\'s\r\nhand. All the world was altered to him since he had entered Pawkins\'s\r\nHotel. Was it then possible that Lily Dale might even yet become his\r\nwife? Could it be true that he, even now, was in a position to go\r\nboldly to the Squire of Allington, and tell him what were his views\r\nwith reference to Lily? And how far would he be justified in taking\r\nthe earl at his word? Some incredible amount of wealth would be\r\nrequired before he could marry Lily Dale. Two or three hundred pounds\r\na year at the very least! The earl could not mean him to understand\r\nthat any such sum as that would be made up with such an object!\r\nNevertheless he resolved as he walked home to Burton Crescent that he\r\nwould go down to Guestwick, and that he would obey the earl\'s behest.\r\nAs regarded Lily herself he felt that nothing could be said to her\r\nfor many a long day as yet.\r\n\r\n"Oh, John, how late you are!" said Amelia, slipping out from the back\r\nparlour as he let himself in with his latch-key.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am;--very late," said John, taking his candle, and passing\r\nher by on the stairs without another word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n"THE TIME WILL COME."\r\n\r\n\r\n"Did you hear that young Eames is staying at Guestwick Manor?"\r\n\r\nAs these were the first words which the squire spoke to Mrs. Dale\r\nas they walked together up to the Great House, after church, on\r\nChristmas Day, it was clear enough that the tidings of Johnny\'s\r\nvisit, when told to him, had made some impression.\r\n\r\n"At Guestwick Manor!" said Mrs. Dale. "Dear me! Do you hear that,\r\nBell? There\'s promotion for Master Johnny!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you remember, mamma," said Bell, "that he helped his lordship\r\nin his trouble with the bull?"\r\n\r\nLily, who remembered accurately all the passages of her last\r\ninterview with John Eames, said nothing, but felt, in some sort, sore\r\nat the idea that he should be so near her at such a time. In some\r\nunconscious way she had liked him for coming to her and saying all\r\nthat he did say. She valued him more highly after that scene than\r\nshe did before. But now, she would feel herself injured and hurt if\r\nhe ever made his way into her presence under circumstances as they\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\n"I should not have thought that Lord De Guest was the man to show so\r\nmuch gratitude for so slight a favour," said the squire. "However,\r\nI\'m going to dine there to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"To meet young Eames?" said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"Yes,--especially to meet young Eames. At least, I\'ve been very\r\nspecially asked to come, and I\'ve been told that he is to be there."\r\n\r\n"And is Bernard going?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I\'m not," said Bernard. "I shall come over and dine with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nA half-formed idea flitted across Lily\'s mind, teaching her to\r\nimagine for a moment that she might possibly be concerned in this\r\narrangement. But the thought vanished as quickly as it came, merely\r\nleaving some soreness behind it. There are certain maladies which\r\nmake the whole body sore. The patient, let him be touched on any\r\npoint,--let him even be nearly touched,--will roar with agony as\r\nthough his whole body had been bruised. So it is also with maladies\r\nof the mind. Sorrows such as that of poor Lily\'s leave the heart sore\r\nat every point, and compel the sufferer to be ever in fear of new\r\nwounds. Lily bore her cross bravely and well; but not the less did\r\nit weigh heavily upon her at every turn because she had the strength\r\nto walk as though she did not bear it. Nothing happened to her,\r\nor in her presence, that did not in some way connect itself with\r\nher misery. Her uncle was going over to meet John Eames at Lord De\r\nGuest\'s. Of course the men there would talk about her, and all such\r\ntalking was an injury to her.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon of that day did not pass away brightly. As long as the\r\nservants were in the room the dinner went on much as other dinners.\r\nAt such times a certain amount of hypocrisy must always be practised\r\nin closely domestic circles. At mixed dinner-parties people can talk\r\nbefore Richard and William the same words that they would use if\r\nRichard and William were not there. People so mixed do not talk\r\ntogether their inward home thoughts. But when close friends are\r\ntogether, a little conscious reticence is practised till the door\r\nis tiled. At such a meeting as this that conscious reticence was of\r\nservice, and created an effect which was salutary. When the door\r\nwas tiled, and when the servants were gone, how could they be merry\r\ntogether? By what mirth should the beards be made to wag on that\r\nChristmas Day?\r\n\r\n"My father has been up in town," said Bernard. "He was with Lord De\r\nGuest at Pawkins\'s."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you go and see him?" asked Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know. He did not seem to wish it. I shall go down\r\nto Torquay in February. I must be up in London, you know, in a\r\nfortnight, for good." Then they were all silent again for a few\r\nminutes. If Bernard could have owned the truth, he would have\r\nacknowledged that he had not gone up to London, because he did not\r\nyet know how to treat Crosbie when he should meet him. His thoughts\r\non this matter threw some sort of shadow across poor Lily\'s mind,\r\nmaking her feel that her wound was again opened.\r\n\r\n"I want him to give up his profession altogether," said the squire,\r\nspeaking firmly and slowly. "It would be better, I think, for both of\r\nus that he should do so."\r\n\r\n"Would it be wise at his time of life," said Mrs. Dale, "and when he\r\nhas been doing so well?"\r\n\r\n"I think it would be wise. If he were my son it would be thought\r\nbetter that he should live here upon the property, among the people\r\nwho are to become his tenants, than remain up in London, or perhaps\r\nbe sent to India. He has one profession as the heir of this place,\r\nand that, I think, should be enough."\r\n\r\n"I should have but an idle life of it down here," said Bernard.\r\n\r\n"That would be your own fault. But if you did as I would have you,\r\nyour life would not be idle." In this he was alluding to Bernard\'s\r\nproposed marriage, but as to that nothing further could be said in\r\nBell\'s presence. Bell understood it all, and sat quite silent, with\r\ndemure countenance;--perhaps even with something of sternness in her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"But the fact is," said Mrs. Dale, speaking in a low tone, and having\r\nwell considered what she was about to say, "that Bernard is not\r\nexactly the same as your son."\r\n\r\n"Why not?" said the squire. "I have even offered to settle the\r\nproperty on him if he will leave the service."\r\n\r\n"You do not owe him so much as you would owe your son; and,\r\ntherefore, he does not owe you as much as he would owe his father."\r\n\r\n"If you mean that I cannot constrain him, I know that well enough.\r\nAs regards money, I have offered to do for him quite as much as any\r\nfather would feel called upon to do for an only son."\r\n\r\n"I hope you don\'t think me ungrateful," said Bernard.\r\n\r\n"No, I do not; but I think you unmindful. I have nothing more to say\r\nabout it, however;--not about that. If you should marry--" And then\r\nhe stopped himself, feeling that he could not go on in Bell\'s\r\npresence.\r\n\r\n"If he should marry," said Mrs. Dale, "it may well be that his wife\r\nwould like a house of her own."\r\n\r\n"Wouldn\'t she have this house?" said the squire, angrily. "Isn\'t it\r\nbig enough? I only want one room for myself, and I\'d give up that if\r\nit were necessary."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t nonsense," said the squire.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be squire of Allington for the next twenty years," said Mrs.\r\nDale. "And as long as you are the squire, you\'ll be master of this\r\nhouse; at least, I hope so. I don\'t approve of monarchs abdicating in\r\nfavour of young people."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think uncle Christopher would look at all well like Charles\r\nthe Fifth," said Lily.\r\n\r\n"I would always keep a cell for you, my darling, if I did," said the\r\nsquire, regarding her with that painful, special tenderness. Lily,\r\nwho was sitting next to Mrs. Dale, put her hand out secretly and got\r\nhold of her mother\'s, thereby indicating that she did not intend to\r\noccupy the cell offered to her by her uncle; or to look to him as the\r\ncompanion of her monastic seclusion. After that there was nothing\r\nmore then said as to Bernard\'s prospects.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Hearn is dining at the vicarage, I suppose?" asked the squire.\r\n\r\n"Yes; she went in after church," said Bell. "I saw her go with Mrs.\r\nBoyce."\r\n\r\n"She told me she never would dine with them again after dark in\r\nwinter," said Mrs. Dale. "The last time she was there, the boy let\r\nthe lamp blow out as she was going home, and she lost her way. The\r\ntruth was, she was angry because Mr. Boyce didn\'t go with her."\r\n\r\n"She\'s always angry," said the squire. "She hardly speaks to me now.\r\nWhen she paid her rent the other day to Jolliffe, she said she hoped\r\nit would do me much good; as though she thought me a brute for taking\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"So she does," said Bernard.\r\n\r\n"She\'s very old, you know," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"I\'d give her the house for nothing, if I were you, uncle," said\r\nLily.\r\n\r\n"No, my dear; if you were me you would not. I should be very wrong\r\nto do so. Why should Mrs. Hearn have her house for nothing, any more\r\nthan her meat or her clothes? It would be much more reasonable were I\r\nto give her so much money into her hand yearly; but it would be wrong\r\nin me to do so, seeing that she is not an object of charity;--and it\r\nwould be wrong in her to take it."\r\n\r\n"And she wouldn\'t take it," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she would. But if she did, I\'m sure she would grumble\r\nbecause it wasn\'t double the amount. And if Mr. Boyce had gone home\r\nwith her, she would have grumbled because he walked too fast."\r\n\r\n"She is very old," said Bell, again.\r\n\r\n"But, nevertheless, she ought to know better than to speak\r\ndisparagingly of me to my servants. She should have more respect for\r\nherself." And the squire showed by the tone of his voice that he\r\nthought very much about it.\r\n\r\nIt was very long and very dull that Christmas evening, making\r\nBernard feel strongly that he would be very foolish to give up his\r\nprofession, and tie himself down to a life at Allington. Women\r\nare more accustomed than men to long, dull, unemployed hours; and,\r\ntherefore, Mrs. Dale and her daughters bore the tedium courageously.\r\nWhile he yawned, stretched himself, and went in and out of the room,\r\nthey sat demurely, listening as the squire laid down the law on\r\nsmall matters, and contradicting him occasionally when the spirit\r\nof either of them prompted her specially to do so. "Of course you\r\nknow much better than I do," he would say. "Not at all," Mrs. Dale\r\nwould answer. "I don\'t pretend to know anything about it. But--" So\r\nthe evening wore itself away; and when the squire was left alone at\r\nhalf-past nine, he did not feel that the day had passed badly with\r\nhim. That was his style of life, and he expected no more from it than\r\nhe got. He did not look to find things very pleasant, and, if not\r\nhappy, he was, at any rate, contented.\r\n\r\n"Only think of Johnny Eames being at Guestwick Manor!" said Bell, as\r\nthey were going home.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why he shouldn\'t be there," said Lily. "I would rather\r\nit should be he than I, because Lady Julia is so grumpy."\r\n\r\n"But asking your uncle Christopher especially to meet him!" said Mrs.\r\nDale. "There must be some reason for it." Then Lily felt the soreness\r\ncome upon her again, and spoke no further upon the subject.\r\n\r\nWe all know that there was a special reason, and that Lily\'s soreness\r\nwas not false in its mysterious forebodings. Eames, on the evening\r\nafter his dinner at Pawkins\'s, had seen the earl, and explained to\r\nhim that he could not leave town till the Saturday evening; but that\r\nhe could remain over the Tuesday. He must be at his office by twelve\r\non Wednesday, and could manage to do that by an early train from\r\nGuestwick.\r\n\r\n"Very well, Johnny," said the earl, talking to his young friend with\r\nthe bedroom candle in his hand, as he was going up to dress. "Then\r\nI\'ll tell you what; I\'ve been thinking of it. I\'ll ask Dale to come\r\nover to dinner on Tuesday; and if he\'ll come, I\'ll explain the whole\r\nmatter to him myself. He\'s a man of business, and he\'ll understand.\r\nIf he won\'t come, why then you must go over to Allington, and find\r\nhim, if you can, on the Tuesday morning; or I\'ll go to him myself,\r\nwhich will be better. You mustn\'t keep me now, as I am ever so much\r\ntoo late."\r\n\r\nEames did not attempt to keep him, but went away feeling that the\r\nwhole matter was being arranged for him in a very wonderful way. And\r\nwhen he got to Allington he found that the squire had accepted the\r\nearl\'s invitation. Then he declared to himself that there was no\r\nlonger any possibility of retractation for him. Of course he did not\r\nwish to retract. The one great longing of his life was to call Lily\r\nDale his own. But he felt afraid of the squire,--that the squire\r\nwould despise him and snub him, and that the earl would perceive that\r\nhe had made a mistake when he saw how his client was scorned and\r\nsnubbed. It was arranged that the earl was to take the squire into\r\nhis own room for a few minutes before dinner, and Johnny felt that he\r\nwould be hardly able to stand his ground in the drawing-room when the\r\ntwo old men should make their appearance together.\r\n\r\nHe got on very well with Lady Julia, who gave herself no airs, and\r\nmade herself very civil. Her brother had told her the whole story,\r\nand she felt as anxious as he did to provide Lily with another\r\nhusband in place of that horrible man Crosbie. "She has been very\r\nfortunate in her escape," she said to her brother; "very fortunate."\r\nThe earl agreed with this, saying that in his opinion his own\r\nfavourite Johnny would make much the nicer lover of the two. But Lady\r\nJulia had her doubts as to Lily\'s acquiescence. "But, Theodore, he\r\nmust not speak to Miss Lilian Dale herself about it yet a while."\r\n\r\n"No," said the earl; "not for a month or so."\r\n\r\n"He will have a better chance if he can remain silent for six\r\nmonths," said Lady Julia.\r\n\r\n"Bless my soul! somebody else will have picked her up before that,"\r\nsaid the earl.\r\n\r\nIn answer to this Lady Julia merely shook her head.\r\n\r\nJohnny went over to his mother on Christmas Day after church, and was\r\nreceived by her and by his sister with great honour. And she gave\r\nhim many injunctions as to his behaviour at the earl\'s table, even\r\ndescending to small details about his boots and linen. But Johnny had\r\nalready begun to feel at the Manor that, after all, people are not so\r\nvery different in their ways of life as they are supposed to be. Lady\r\nJulia\'s manners were certainly not quite those of Mrs. Roper; but\r\nshe made the tea very much in the way in which it was made at Burton\r\nCrescent, and Eames found that he could eat his egg, at any rate on\r\nthe second morning, without any tremor in his hand, in spite of the\r\ncoronet on the silver egg-cup. He did feel himself to be rather out\r\nof his place in the Manor pew on the Sunday, conceiving that all the\r\ncongregation was looking at him; but he got over this on Christmas\r\nDay, and sat quite comfortably in his soft corner during the sermon,\r\nalmost going to sleep. And when he walked with the earl after church\r\nto the gate over which the noble peer had climbed in his agony, and\r\ninspected the hedge through which he had thrown himself, he was quite\r\nat home with his little jokes, bantering his august companion as to\r\nthe mode of his somersault. But be it always remembered that there\r\nare two modes in which a young man may be free and easy with his\r\nelder and superior,--the mode pleasant and the mode offensive. Had it\r\nbeen in Johnny\'s nature to try the latter, the earl\'s back would soon\r\nhave been up at once, and the play would have been over. But it was\r\nnot in Johnny\'s nature to do so, and therefore it was that the earl\r\nliked him.\r\n\r\nAt last came the hour of dinner on Tuesday, or at least the hour at\r\nwhich the squire had been asked to show himself at the Manor House.\r\nEames, as by agreement with his patron, did not come down so as to\r\nshow himself till after the interview. Lady Julia, who had been\r\npresent at their discussions, had agreed to receive the squire; and\r\nthen a servant was to ask him to step into the earl\'s own room. It\r\nwas pretty to see the way in which the three conspired together,\r\nplanning and plotting with an eagerness that was beautifully green\r\nand fresh.\r\n\r\n"He can be as cross as an old stick when he likes it," said the earl,\r\nspeaking of the squire; "and we must take care not to rub him the\r\nwrong way."\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t know what to say to him when I come down," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"Just shake hands with him and don\'t say anything," said Lady Julia.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll give him some port wine that ought to soften his heart," said\r\nthe earl, "and then we\'ll see how he is in the evening."\r\n\r\nEames heard the wheels of the squire\'s little open carriage and\r\ntrembled. The squire, unconscious of all schemes, soon found himself\r\nwith Lady Julia, and within two minutes of his entrance was walked\r\noff to the earl\'s private room. "Certainly," he said, "certainly;"\r\nand followed the man-servant. The earl, as he entered, was standing\r\nin the middle of the room, and his round rosy face was a picture of\r\ngood-humour.\r\n\r\n"I\'m very glad you\'ve come, Dale," said he. "I\'ve something I want to\r\nsay to you."\r\n\r\nMr. Dale, who neither in heart nor in manner was so light a man as\r\nthe earl, took the proffered hand of his host, and bowed his head\r\nslightly, signifying that he was willing to listen to anything.\r\n\r\n"I think I told you," continued the earl, "that young John Eames is\r\ndown here; but he goes back to-morrow, as they can\'t spare him at his\r\noffice. He\'s a very good fellow,--as far as I am able to judge, an\r\nuncommonly good young man. I\'ve taken a great fancy to him myself."\r\n\r\nIn answer to this Mr. Dale did not say much. He sat down, and in some\r\ngeneral terms expressed his good-will towards all the Eames family.\r\n\r\n"As you know, Dale, I\'m a very bad hand at talking, and therefore\r\nI won\'t beat about the bush in what I\'ve got to say at present. Of\r\ncourse we\'ve all heard of that scoundrel Crosbie, and the way he has\r\ntreated your niece Lilian."\r\n\r\n"He is a scoundrel,--an unmixed scoundrel. But the less we say about\r\nthat the better. It is ill mentioning a girl\'s name in such a matter\r\nas that."\r\n\r\n"But, my dear Dale, I must mention it at the present moment. Dear\r\nyoung child, I would do anything to comfort her! And I hope that\r\nsomething may be done to comfort her. Do you know that that young man\r\nwas in love with her long before Crosbie ever saw her?"\r\n\r\n"What;--John Eames!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, John Eames. And I wish heartily for his sake that he had won\r\nher regard before she had met that rascal whom you had to stay down\r\nat your house."\r\n\r\n"A man cannot help these things, De Guest," said the squire.\r\n\r\n"No, no, no! There are such men about the world, and it is impossible\r\nto know them at a glance. He was my nephew\'s friend, and I am not\r\ngoing to say that my nephew was in fault. But I wish,--I only say\r\nthat I wish,--she had first known what are this young man\'s feelings\r\ntowards her."\r\n\r\n"But she might not have thought of him as you do."\r\n\r\n"He is an uncommonly good-looking young fellow; straight made, broad\r\nin the chest, with a good, honest eye, and a young man\'s proper\r\ncourage. He has never been taught to give himself airs like a dancing\r\nmonkey; but I think he\'s all the better for that."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s too late now, De Guest."\r\n\r\n"No, no; that\'s just where it is. It mustn\'t be too late! That child\r\nis not to lose her whole life because a villain has played her false.\r\nOf course she\'ll suffer. Just at present it wouldn\'t do, I suppose,\r\nto talk to her about a new sweetheart. But, Dale, the time will come;\r\nthe time will come;--the time always does come."\r\n\r\n"It has never come to you and me," said the squire, with the\r\nslightest possible smile on his dry cheeks. The story of their\r\nlives had been so far the same; each had loved, and each had been\r\ndisappointed, and then each had remained single through life.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it has," said the earl, with no slight touch of feeling and\r\neven of romance in what he said. "We have retricked our beams in our\r\nown ways, and our lives have not been desolate. But for her,--you and\r\nher mother will look forward to see her married some day."\r\n\r\n"I have not thought about it."\r\n\r\n"But I want you to think about it. I want to interest you in this\r\nfellow\'s favour; and in doing so, I mean to be very open with you.\r\nI suppose you\'ll give her something?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, I\'m sure," said the squire, almost offended at an\r\ninquiry of such a nature.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, whether you do or not, I\'ll give him something," said\r\nthe earl. "I shouldn\'t have ventured to meddle in the matter had I\r\nnot intended to put myself in such a position with reference to him\r\nas would justify me in asking the question." And the peer as he spoke\r\ndrew himself up to his full height. "If such a match can be made, it\r\nshall not be a bad marriage for your niece in a pecuniary point of\r\nview. I shall have pleasure in giving to him; but I shall have more\r\npleasure if she can share what I give."\r\n\r\n"She ought to be very much obliged to you," said the squire.\r\n\r\n"I think she would be if she knew young Eames. I hope the day may\r\ncome when she will be so. I hope that you and I may see them happy\r\ntogether, and that you too may thank me for having assisted in making\r\nthem so. Shall we go in to Lady Julia now?" The earl had felt that he\r\nhad not quite succeeded; that his offer had been accepted somewhat\r\ncoldly, and had not much hope that further good could be done on that\r\nday, even with the help of his best port wine.\r\n\r\n"Half a moment," said the squire. "There are matters as to which I\r\nnever find myself able to speak quickly, and this certainly seems to\r\nbe one of them. If you will allow me I will think over what you have\r\nsaid, and then see you again."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, certainly."\r\n\r\n"But for your own part in the matter, for your great generosity and\r\nkind heart, I beg to offer you my warmest thanks." Then the squire\r\nbowed low, and preceded the earl out of the room.\r\n\r\nLord De Guest still felt that he had not succeeded. We may probably\r\nsay, looking at the squire\'s character and peculiarities, that no\r\nmarked success was probable at the first opening-out of such a\r\nsubject. He had said of himself that he was never able to speak\r\nquickly in matters of moment; but he would more correctly have\r\ndescribed his own character had he declared that he could not think\r\nof them quickly. As it was, the earl was disappointed; but had he\r\nbeen able to read the squire\'s mind, his disappointment would have\r\nbeen less strong. Mr. Dale knew well enough that he was being treated\r\nwell, and that the effort being made was intended with kindness\r\nto those belonging to him; but it was not in his nature to be\r\ndemonstrative and quick at expressions of gratitude. So he entered\r\nthe drawing-room with a cold, placid face, leading Eames, and Lady\r\nJulia also, to suppose that no good had been done.\r\n\r\n"How do you do, sir?" said Johnny, walking up to him in a wild sort\r\nof manner,--going through a premeditated lesson, but doing it without\r\nany presence of mind.\r\n\r\n"How do you do, Eames?" said the squire, speaking with a very cold\r\nvoice. And then there was nothing further said till the dinner was\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\n"Dale, I know you drink port," said the earl when Lady Julia left\r\nthem. "If you say you don\'t like that, I shall say you know nothing\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\n"Ah! that\'s the \'20," said the squire, tasting it.\r\n\r\n"I should rather think it is," said the earl. "I was lucky enough to\r\nget it early, and it hasn\'t been moved for thirty years. I like to\r\ngive it to a man who knows it, as you do, at the first glance. Now\r\nthere\'s my friend Johnny there; it\'s thrown away upon him."\r\n\r\n"No, my lord, it is not. I think it\'s uncommonly nice."\r\n\r\n"Uncommonly nice! So is champagne, or ginger-beer, or lollipops,--for\r\nthose who like them. Do you mean to tell me you can taste wine with\r\nhalf a pickled orange in your mouth?"\r\n\r\n"It\'ll come to him soon enough," said the squire.\r\n\r\n"Twenty port won\'t come to him when he is as old as we are," said the\r\nearl, forgetting that by that time sixty port will be as wonderful to\r\nthe then living seniors of the age as was his own pet vintage to him.\r\n\r\nThe good wine did in some sort soften the squire; but, as a matter\r\nof course, nothing further was said as to the new matrimonial scheme.\r\nThe earl did observe, however, that Mr. Dale was civil, and even\r\nkind, to his own young friend, asking a question here and there as\r\nto his life in London, and saying something about the work at the\r\nIncome-tax Office.\r\n\r\n"It is hard work," said Eames. "If you\'re under the line, they make\r\na great row about it, send for you, and look at you as though you\'d\r\nbeen robbing the bank; but they think nothing of keeping you till\r\nfive."\r\n\r\n"But how long do you have for lunch and reading the papers?" said the\r\nearl.\r\n\r\n"Not ten minutes. We take a paper among twenty of us for half the\r\nday. That\'s exactly nine minutes to each; and as for lunch, we only\r\nhave a biscuit dipped in ink."\r\n\r\n"Dipped in ink!" said the squire.\r\n\r\n"It comes to that, for you have to be writing while you munch it."\r\n\r\n"I hear all about you," said the earl; "Sir Raffle Buffle is an old\r\ncrony of mine."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose he ever heard my name as yet," said Johnny. "But do\r\nyou really know him well, Lord De Guest?"\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t seen him these thirty years; but I did know him."\r\n\r\n"We call him old Huffle Scuffle."\r\n\r\n"Huffle Scuffle! Ha, ha, ha! He always was Huffle Scuffle; a noisy,\r\npretentious, empty-headed fellow. But I oughtn\'t to say so before\r\nyou, young man. Come, we\'ll go into the drawing-room."\r\n\r\n"And what did he say?" asked Lady Julia, as soon as the squire was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nThere was no attempt at concealment, and the question was asked in\r\nJohnny\'s presence.\r\n\r\n"Well, he did not say much. And coming from him, that ought to be\r\ntaken as a good sign. He is to think of it, and let me see him again.\r\nYou hold your head up, Johnny, and remember that you shan\'t want a\r\nfriend on your side. Faint heart never won fair lady."\r\n\r\nAt seven o\'clock on the following morning Eames started on his return\r\njourney, and was at his desk at twelve o\'clock,--as per agreement\r\nwith his taskmaster at the Income-tax Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE COMBAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: (untitled)]\r\n\r\nI have said that John Eames was at his office punctually at twelve;\r\nbut an incident had happened before his arrival there very important\r\nin the annals which are now being told,--so important that it\r\nis essentially necessary that it should be described with some\r\nminuteness of detail.\r\n\r\nLord De Guest, in the various conversations which he had had with\r\nEames as to Lily Dale and her present position, had always spoken\r\nof Crosbie with the most vehement abhorrence. "He is a damned\r\nblackguard," said the earl, and the fire had come out of his round\r\neyes as he spoke. Now the earl was by no means given to cursing and\r\nswearing, in the sense which is ordinarily applied to these words.\r\nWhen he made use of such a phrase as that quoted above, it was to be\r\npresumed that he in some sort meant what he said; and so he did, and\r\nhad intended to signify that Crosbie by his conduct had merited all\r\nsuch condemnation as was the fitting punishment for blackguardism of\r\nthe worst description.\r\n\r\n"He ought to have his neck broken," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about that," said the earl. "The present times have\r\nbecome so pretty behaved that corporal punishment seems to have gone\r\nout of fashion. I shouldn\'t care so much about that, if any other\r\npunishment had taken its place. But it seems to me that a blackguard\r\nsuch as Crosbie can escape now altogether unscathed."\r\n\r\n"He hasn\'t escaped yet," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you go and put your finger in the pie and make a fool of\r\nyourself," said the earl. If it had behoved any one to resent in any\r\nviolent fashion the evil done by Crosbie, Bernard Dale, the earl\'s\r\nnephew, should have been the avenger. This the earl felt, but under\r\nthese circumstances he was disposed to think that there should be no\r\nsuch violent vengeance. "Things were different when I was young," he\r\nsaid to himself. But Eames gathered from the earl\'s tone that the\r\nearl\'s words were not strictly in accordance with his thoughts, and\r\nhe declared to himself over and over again that Crosbie had not yet\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nHe got into the train at Guestwick, taking a first-class ticket,\r\nbecause the earl\'s groom in livery was in attendance upon him. Had\r\nhe been alone he would have gone in a cheaper carriage. Very weak in\r\nhim, was it not? little also, and mean? My friend, can you say that\r\nyou would not have done the same at his age? Are you quite sure that\r\nyou would not do the same now that you are double his age? Be that as\r\nit may, Johnny Eames did that foolish thing, and gave the groom in\r\nlivery half-a-crown into the bargain.\r\n\r\n"We shall have you down again soon, Mr. John," said the groom, who\r\nseemed to understand that Mr. Eames was to be made quite at home at\r\nthe manor.\r\n\r\nHe went fast to sleep in the carriage, and did not awake till the\r\ntrain was stopped at the Barchester Junction.\r\n\r\n"Waiting for the up-train from Barchester, sir," said the guard.\r\n"They\'re always late." Then he went to sleep again, and was aroused\r\nin a few minutes by some one entering the carriage in a great hurry.\r\nThe branch train had come in, just as the guardians of the line then\r\npresent had made up their minds that the passengers on the main line\r\nshould not be kept waiting any longer. The transfer of men, women,\r\nand luggage was therefore made in great haste, and they who were\r\nnow taking their new seats had hardly time to look about them. An\r\nold gentleman, very red about the gills, first came into Johnny\'s\r\ncarriage, which up to that moment he had shared with an old lady.\r\nThe old gentleman was abusing everybody, because he was hurried, and\r\nwould not take himself well into the compartment, but stuck in the\r\ndoorway, standing on the step.\r\n\r\n"Now, sir, when you\'re quite at leisure," said a voice behind the old\r\nman, which instantly made Eames start up in his seat.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not at all at leisure," said the old man; "and I\'m not going to\r\nbreak my legs if I know it."\r\n\r\n"Take your time, sir," said the guard.\r\n\r\n"So I mean," said the old man, seating himself in the corner nearest\r\nto the open door, opposite to the old lady. Then Eames saw plainly\r\nthat it was Crosbie who had first spoken, and that he was getting\r\ninto the carriage.\r\n\r\nCrosbie at the first glance saw no one but the old gentleman and the\r\nold lady, and he immediately made for the unoccupied corner seat.\r\nHe was busy with his umbrella and his dressing-bag, and a little\r\nflustered by the pushing and hurrying. The carriage was actually\r\nin motion before he perceived that John Eames was opposite to him:\r\nEames had, instinctively, drawn up his legs so as not to touch him.\r\nHe felt that he had become very red in the face, and to tell the\r\ntruth, the perspiration had broken out upon his brow. It was a\r\ngreat occasion,--great in its imminent trouble, and great in its\r\nopportunity for action. How was he to carry himself at the first\r\nmoment of his recognition by his enemy, and what was he to do\r\nafterwards?\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be explained that Crosbie had also been spending his\r\nChristmas with a certain earl of his acquaintance, and that he too\r\nwas returning to his office. In one respect he had been much more\r\nfortunate than poor Eames, for he had been made happy with the smiles\r\nof his lady love. Alexandrina and the countess had fluttered about\r\nhim softly, treating him as a tame chattel, now belonging to the\r\nnoble house of De Courcy, and in this way he had been initiated into\r\nthe inner domesticities of that illustrious family. The two extra\r\nmen-servants, hired to wait upon Lady Dumbello, had vanished. The\r\nchampagne had ceased to flow in a perennial stream. Lady Rosina had\r\ncome out from her solitude, and had preached at him constantly. Lady\r\nMargaretta had given him some lessons in economy. The Honourable\r\nJohn, in spite of a late quarrel, had borrowed five pounds from him.\r\nThe Honourable George had engaged to come and stay with his sister\r\nduring the next May. The earl had used a father-in-law\'s privilege,\r\nand had called him a fool. Lady Alexandrina had told him more than\r\nonce, in rather a tart voice, that this must be done, and that that\r\nmust be done; and the countess had given him her orders as though\r\nit was his duty, in the course of nature, to obey every word that\r\nfell from her. Such had been his Christmas delights; and now, as he\r\nreturned back from the enjoyment of them, he found himself confronted\r\nin the railway carriage with Johnny Eames!\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the two met, and Crosbie made a slight inclination of\r\nhis head. To this Eames gave no acknowledgment whatever, but looked\r\nstraight into the other\'s face. Crosbie immediately saw that they\r\nwere not to know each other, and was well contented that it should be\r\nso. Among all his many troubles, the enmity of John Eames did not go\r\nfor much. He showed no appearance of being disconcerted, though our\r\nfriend had shown much. He opened his bag, and taking out a book was\r\nsoon deeply engaged in it, pursuing his studies as though the man\r\nopposite was quite unknown to him. I will not say that his mind did\r\nnot run away from his book, for indeed there were many things of\r\nwhich he found it impossible not to think; but it did not revert to\r\nJohn Eames. Indeed, when the carriages reached Paddington, he had in\r\ntruth all but forgotten him; and as he stepped out of the carriage,\r\nwith his bag in his hand, was quite free from any remotest trouble on\r\nhis account.\r\n\r\nBut it had not been so with Eames himself. Every moment of the\r\njourney had for him been crowded with thought as to what he would do\r\nnow that chance had brought his enemy within his reach. He had been\r\nmade quite wretched by the intensity of his thinking; and yet, when\r\nthe carriages stopped, he had not made up his mind. His face had been\r\ncovered with perspiration ever since Crosbie had come across him, and\r\nhis limbs had hardly been under his own command. Here had come to him\r\na great opportunity, and he felt so little confidence in himself that\r\nhe almost knew that he would not use it properly. Twice and thrice\r\nhe had almost flown at Crosbie\'s throat in the carriage, but he was\r\nrestrained by an idea that the world and the police would be against\r\nhim if he did such a thing in the presence of that old lady.\r\n\r\nBut when Crosbie turned his back upon him, and walked out, it was\r\nabsolutely necessary that he should do something. He was not going to\r\nlet the man escape, after all that he had said as to the expediency\r\nof thrashing him. Any other disgrace would be preferable to that.\r\nFearing, therefore, lest his enemy should be too quick for him,\r\nhe hurried out after him, and only just gave Crosbie time to turn\r\nround and face the carriages before he was upon him. "You confounded\r\nscoundrel!" he screamed out. "You confounded scoundrel!" and seized\r\nhim by the throat, throwing himself upon him, and almost devouring\r\nhim by the fury of his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe crowd upon the platform was not very dense, but there were quite\r\nenough of people to make a very respectable audience for this little\r\nplay. Crosbie, in his dismay, retreated a step or two, and his\r\nretreat was much accelerated by the weight of Eames\'s attack. He\r\nendeavoured to free his throat from his foe\'s grasp; but in that he\r\nfailed entirely. For the minute, however, he did manage to escape any\r\npositive blow, owing his safety in that respect rather to Eames\'s\r\nawkwardness than to his own efforts. Something about the police he\r\nwas just able to utter, and there was, as a matter of course, an\r\nimmediate call for a supply of those functionaries. In about three\r\nminutes three policemen, assisted by six porters, had captured our\r\npoor friend Johnny; but this had not been done quick enough for\r\nCrosbie\'s purposes. The bystanders, taken by surprise, had allowed\r\nthe combatants to fall back upon Mr. Smith\'s book-stall, and there\r\nEames laid his foe prostrate among the newspapers, falling himself\r\ninto the yellow shilling-novel depot by the over fury of his own\r\nenergy; but as he fell, he contrived to lodge one blow with his fist\r\nin Crosbie\'s right eye,--one telling blow; and Crosbie had, to all\r\nintents and purposes, been thrashed.\r\n\r\n"Con--founded scoundrel, rascal, blackguard!" shouted Johnny, with\r\nwhat remnants of voice were left to him, as the police dragged him\r\noff. "If you only knew--what he\'s--done." But in the meantime the\r\npolicemen held him fast.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course the first burst of public sympathy went with\r\nCrosbie. He had been assaulted, and the assault had come from Eames.\r\nIn the British bosom there is so firm a love of well-constituted\r\norder, that these facts alone were sufficient to bring twenty knights\r\nto the assistance of the three policemen and the six porters; so that\r\nfor Eames, even had he desired it, there was no possible chance of\r\nescape. But he did not desire it. One only sorrow consumed him at\r\npresent. He had, as he felt, attacked Crosbie, but had attacked\r\nhim in vain. He had had his opportunity, and had misused it. He\r\nwas perfectly unconscious of that happy blow, and was in absolute\r\nignorance of the great fact that his enemy\'s eye was already swollen\r\nand closed, and that in another hour it would be as black as his hat.\r\n\r\n"He is a con--founded rascal!" ejaculated Eames, as the policemen and\r\nporters hauled him about. "You don\'t know what he\'s done."\r\n\r\n"No, we don\'t," said the senior constable; "but we know what you have\r\ndone. I say, Bushers, where\'s that gentleman? He\'d better come along\r\nwith us."\r\n\r\nCrosbie had been picked up from among the newspapers by another\r\npoliceman and two or three other porters, and was attended also by\r\nthe guard of the train, who knew him, and knew that he had come up\r\nfrom Courcy Castle. Three or four hangers-on were standing also\r\naround him, together with a benevolent medical man who was proposing\r\nto him an immediate application of leeches. If he could have done\r\nas he wished, he would have gone his way quietly, allowing Eames to\r\ndo the same. A great evil had befallen him, but he could in no way\r\nmitigate that evil by taking the law of the man who had attacked him.\r\nTo have the thing as little talked about as possible should be his\r\nendeavour. What though he should have Eames locked up and fined, and\r\nscolded by a police magistrate? That would not in any degree lessen\r\nhis calamity. If he could have parried the attack, and got the better\r\nof his foe; if he could have administered the black eye instead of\r\nreceiving it, then indeed he could have laughed the matter off at his\r\nclub, and his original crime would have been somewhat glozed over by\r\nhis success in arms. But such good fortune had not been his. He was\r\nforced, however, on the moment to decide as to what he would do.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got him here in custody, sir," said Bushers, touching his hat.\r\nIt had become known from the guard that Crosbie was somewhat of a big\r\nman, a frequent guest at Courcy Castle, and of repute and station in\r\nthe higher regions of the Metropolitan world. "The magistrates will\r\nbe sitting at Paddington, now, sir--or will be by the time we get\r\nthere."\r\n\r\nBy this time some mighty railway authority had come upon the scene\r\nand made himself cognizant of the facts of the row,--a stern official\r\nwho seemed to carry the weight of many engines on his brow; one at\r\nthe very sight of whom smokers would drop their cigars, and porters\r\nclose their fists against sixpences; a great man with an erect chin,\r\na quick step, and a well-brushed hat powerful with an elaborately\r\nupturned brim. This was the platform-superintendent, dominant even\r\nover the policemen.\r\n\r\n"Step into my room, Mr. Crosbie," he said. "Stubbs, bring that man\r\nin with you." And then, before Crosbie had been able to make up\r\nhis mind as to any other line of conduct, he found himself in the\r\nsuperintendent\'s room, accompanied by the guard, and by the two\r\npolicemen who conducted Johnny Eames between them.\r\n\r\n"What\'s all this?" said the superintendent, still keeping on his hat,\r\nfor he was aware how much of the excellence of his personal dignity\r\nwas owing to the arrangement of that article; and as he spoke he\r\nfrowned upon the culprit with his utmost severity. "Mr. Crosbie, I am\r\nvery sorry that you should have been exposed to such brutality on our\r\nplatform."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know what he has done," said Johnny. "He is the most\r\nconfounded scoundrel living. He has broken--" But then he stopped\r\nhimself. He was going to tell the superintendent that the confounded\r\nscoundrel had broken a beautiful young lady\'s heart; but he bethought\r\nhimself that he would not allude more specially to Lily Dale in that\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\n"Do you know who he is, Mr. Crosbie?" said the superintendent.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said Crosbie, whose eye was already becoming blue. "He is\r\na clerk in the Income-tax Office, and his name is Eames. I believe\r\nyou had better leave him to me."\r\n\r\nBut the superintendent at once wrote down the words "Income-tax\r\nOffice--Eames," on his tablet. "We can\'t allow a row like that to\r\ntake place on our platform and not notice it. I shall bring it before\r\nthe directors. It\'s a most disgraceful affair, Mr. Eames--most\r\ndisgraceful."\r\n\r\nBut Johnny by this time had perceived that Crosbie\'s eye was in a\r\nstate which proved satisfactorily that his morning\'s work had not\r\nbeen thrown away, and his spirits were rising accordingly. He did not\r\ncare two straws for the superintendent or even for the policemen, if\r\nonly the story could be made to tell well for himself hereafter. It\r\nwas his object to have thrashed Crosbie, and now, as he looked at his\r\nenemy\'s face, he acknowledged that Providence had been good to him.\r\n\r\n"That\'s your opinion," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, it is," said the superintendent; "and I shall know how to\r\nrepresent the matter to your superiors, young man."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know all about it," said Eames; "and I don\'t suppose you\r\never will. I had made up my mind what I\'d do the first time I saw\r\nthat scoundrel there; and now I\'ve done it. He\'d have got much worse\r\nin the railway carriage, only there was a lady there."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Crosbie, I really think we had better take him before the\r\nmagistrates."\r\n\r\nTo this, however, Crosbie objected. He assured the superintendent\r\nthat he would himself know how to deal with the matter--which,\r\nhowever, was exactly what he did not know. Would the superintendent\r\nallow one of the railway servants to get a cab for him, and to find\r\nhis luggage? He was very anxious to get home without being subjected\r\nto any more of Mr. Eames\'s insolence.\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t done with Mr. Eames\'s insolence yet, I can tell you. All\r\nLondon shall hear of it, and shall know why. If you have any shame in\r\nyou, you shall be ashamed to show your face."\r\n\r\nUnfortunate man! Who can say that punishment--adequate\r\npunishment--had not overtaken him? For the present, he had to sneak\r\nhome with a black eye, with the knowledge inside him that he had been\r\nwhipped by a clerk in the Income-tax Office; and for the future--he\r\nwas bound over to marry Lady Alexandrina De Courcy!\r\n\r\nHe got himself smuggled off in a cab, without being forced to go\r\nagain upon the platform--his luggage being brought to him by two\r\nassiduous porters. But in all this there was very little balm for his\r\nhurt pride. As he ordered the cabman to drive to Mount Street, he\r\nfelt that he had ruined himself by that step in life which he had\r\ntaken at Courcy Castle. Whichever way he looked he had no comfort.\r\n"D---- the fellow!" he said, almost out loud in the cab; but though\r\nhe did with his outward voice allude to Eames, the curse in his inner\r\nthoughts was uttered against himself.\r\n\r\nJohnny was allowed to make his way down to the platform, and there\r\nfind his own carpet-bag. One young porter, however, came up and\r\nfraternized with him.\r\n\r\n"You guve it him tidy just at that last moment, sir. But, laws, sir,\r\nyou should have let out at him at fust. What\'s the use of clawing a\r\nman\'s neck-collar?"\r\n\r\nIt was then a quarter past eleven, but, nevertheless, Eames appeared\r\nat his office precisely at twelve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nVAE VICTIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrosbie had two engagements for that day; one being his natural\r\nengagement to do his work at his office, and the other an engagement,\r\nwhich was now very often becoming as natural, to dine at St. John\'s\r\nWood with Lady Amelia Gazebee. It was manifest to him when he\r\nlooked at himself in the glass that he could keep neither of these\r\nengagements. "Oh, laws, Mr. Crosbie," the woman of the house\r\nexclaimed when she saw him.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know," said he. "I\'ve had an accident and got a black eye.\r\nWhat\'s a good thing for it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! an accident!" said the woman, who knew well that that mark had\r\nbeen made by another man\'s fist. "They do say that a bit of raw beef\r\nis about the best thing. But then it must be held on constant all the\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\nAnything would be better than leeches, which tell long-enduring\r\ntales, and therefore Crosbie sat through the greater part of the\r\nmorning holding the raw beef to his eye. But it was necessary that he\r\nshould write two notes as he held it, one to Mr. Butterwell at his\r\noffice, and the other to his future sister-in-law. He felt that it\r\nwould hardly be wise to attempt any entire concealment of the nature\r\nof his catastrophe, as some of the circumstances would assuredly\r\nbecome known. If he said that he had fallen over the coal-scuttle,\r\nor on to the fender, thereby cutting his face, people would learn\r\nthat he had fibbed, and would learn also that he had had some reason\r\nfor fibbing. Therefore he constructed his notes with a phraseology\r\nthat bound him to no details. To Butterwell he said that he had had\r\nan accident--or rather a row--and that he had come out of it with\r\nconsiderable damage to his frontispiece. He intended to be at the\r\noffice on the next day, whether able to appear decently there or not.\r\nBut for the sake of decency he thought it well to give himself that\r\none half-day\'s chance. Then to the Lady Amelia he also said that he\r\nhad had an accident, and had been a little hurt. "It is nothing at\r\nall serious, and affects only my appearance, so that I had better\r\nremain in for a day. I shall certainly be with you on Sunday. Don\'t\r\nlet Gazebee trouble himself to come to me, as I shan\'t be at home\r\nafter to-day." Gazebee did trouble himself to come to Mount Street so\r\noften, and South Audley Street, in which was Mr. Gazebee\'s office,\r\nwas so disagreeably near to Mount Street, that Crosbie inserted this\r\nin order to protect himself if possible. Then he gave special orders\r\nthat he was to be at home to no one, fearing that Gazebee would call\r\nfor him after the hours of business--to make him safe and carry him\r\noff bodily to St. John\'s Wood.\r\n\r\nThe beefsteak and the dose of physic and the cold-water application\r\nwhich was kept upon it all night was not efficacious in dispelling\r\nthat horrid, black-blue colour by ten o\'clock on the following\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n"It certainly have gone down, Mr. Crosbie; it certainly have," said\r\nthe mistress of the lodgings, touching the part affected with her\r\nfinger. "But the black won\'t go out of them all in a minute; it won\'t\r\nindeed. Couldn\'t you just stay in one more day?"\r\n\r\n"But will one day do it, Mrs. Phillips?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Phillips couldn\'t take upon herself to say that it would. "They\r\nmostly come with little red streaks across the black before they goes\r\naway," said Mrs. Phillips, who would seem to have been the wife of a\r\nprize-fighter, so well was she acquainted with black eyes.\r\n\r\n"And that won\'t be till to-morrow," said Crosbie, affecting to be\r\nmirthful in his agony.\r\n\r\n"Not till the third day;--and then they wears themselves out,\r\ngradual. I never knew leeches do any good."\r\n\r\nHe stayed at home the second day, and then resolved that he would\r\ngo to his office, black eye and all. In that morning\'s newspaper he\r\nsaw an account of the whole transaction, saying how Mr. C---- of\r\nthe office of General Committees, who was soon about to lead to the\r\nhymeneal altar the beautiful daughter of the Earl De C----, had been\r\nmade the subject of a brutal personal attack on the platform of the\r\nGreat Western Railway Station, and how he was confined to his room\r\nfrom the injuries which he had received. The paragraph went on to\r\nstate that the delinquent had, as it was believed, dared to raise\r\nhis eyes to the same lady, and that his audacity had been treated\r\nwith scorn by every member of the noble family in question. "It was,\r\nhowever, satisfactory to know," so said the newspaper, "that Mr.\r\nC---- had amply avenged himself, and had so flogged the young man\r\nin question, that he had been unable to stir from his bed since the\r\noccurrence."\r\n\r\nOn reading this Crosbie felt that it would be better that he should\r\nshow himself at once, and tell as much of the truth as the world\r\nwould be likely to ascertain at last without his telling. So on that\r\nthird morning he put on his hat and gloves, and had himself taken\r\nto his office, though the red-streaky period of his misfortune had\r\nhardly even yet come upon him. The task of walking along the office\r\npassage, through the messengers\' lobby, and into his room, was very\r\ndisagreeable. Of course everybody looked at him, and of course\r\nhe failed in his attempt to appear as though he did not mind it.\r\n"Boggs," he said to one of the men as he passed by, "just see if Mr.\r\nButterwell is in his room," and then, as he expected, Mr. Butterwell\r\ncame to him after the expiration of a few minutes.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, that is serious," said Mr. Butterwell, looking into\r\nthe secretary\'s damaged face. "I don\'t think I would have come out if\r\nI had been you."\r\n\r\n"Of course it\'s disagreeable," said Crosbie; "but it\'s better to put\r\nup with it. Fellows do tell such horrid lies if a man isn\'t seen for\r\na day or two. I believe it\'s best to put a good face upon it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s more than you can do just at present, eh, Crosbie?" And then\r\nMr. Butterwell tittered. "But how on earth did it happen? The paper\r\nsays that you pretty well killed the fellow who did it."\r\n\r\n"The paper lies, as papers always do. I didn\'t touch him at all."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you, though? I should like to have had a poke at him after\r\ngetting such a tap in the face as that."\r\n\r\n"The policemen came, and all that sort of thing. One isn\'t allowed\r\nto fight it out in a row of that kind as one would have to do on\r\nSalisbury heath. Not that I mean to say that I could lick the fellow.\r\nHow\'s a man to know whether he can or not?"\r\n\r\n"How, indeed, unless he gets a licking,--or gives it? But who was he,\r\nand what\'s this about his having been scorned by the noble family?"\r\n\r\n"Trash and lies, of course. He had never seen any of the De Courcy\r\npeople."\r\n\r\n"I suppose the truth is, it was about that other--eh, Crosbie? I knew\r\nyou\'d find yourself in some trouble before you\'d done."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what it was about, or why he should have made such a\r\nbrute of himself. You have heard about those people at Allington?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I have heard about them."\r\n\r\n"God knows, I didn\'t mean to say anything against them. They knew\r\nnothing about it."\r\n\r\n"But the young fellow knew them? Ah, yes, I see all about it. He\r\nwants to step into your shoes. I can\'t say that he sets about it in a\r\nbad way. But what do you mean to do?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing."\r\n\r\n"Nothing! Won\'t that look queer? I think I should have him before the\r\nmagistrates."\r\n\r\n"You see, Butterwell, I am bound to spare that girl\'s name. I know I\r\nhave behaved badly."\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; I fear you have."\r\n\r\nMr. Butterwell said this with some considerable amount of decision in\r\nhis voice, as though he did not intend to mince matters, or in any\r\nway to hide his opinion. Crosbie had got into a way of condemning\r\nhimself in this matter of his marriage, but was very anxious that\r\nothers, on hearing such condemnation from him, should say something\r\nin the way of palliating his fault. It would be so easy for a friend\r\nto remark that such little peccadilloes were not altogether uncommon,\r\nand that it would sometimes happen in life that people did not know\r\ntheir own minds. He had hoped for some such benevolence from Fowler\r\nPratt, but had hoped in vain. Butterwell was a good-natured, easy\r\nman, anxious to stand well with all about him, never pretending to\r\nany very high tone of feeling or of morals; and yet Butterwell would\r\nsay no word of comfort to him. He could get no one to slur over his\r\nsin for him, as though it were no sin,--only an unfortunate mistake;\r\nno one but the De Courcys, who had, as it were, taken possession of\r\nhim and swallowed him alive.\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be helped now," said Crosbie. "But as for that fellow who\r\nmade such a brutal attack on me the other morning, he knows that he\r\nis safe behind her petticoats. I can do nothing which would not make\r\nsome mention of her name necessary."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; I see," said Butterwell. "It\'s very unfortunate; very. I\r\ndon\'t know that I can do anything for you. Will you come before the\r\nBoard to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; of course I shall," said Crosbie, who was becoming very sore.\r\nHis sharp ear had told him that all Butterwell\'s respect and\r\ncordiality were gone,--at any rate for the time. Butterwell, though\r\nholding the higher official rank, had always been accustomed to treat\r\nhim as though he, the inferior, were to be courted. He had possessed,\r\nand had known himself to possess, in his office as well as in the\r\noutside world, a sort of rank much higher than that which from his\r\nposition he could claim legitimately. Now he was being deposed. There\r\ncould be no better touchstone in such a matter than Butterwell. He\r\nwould go as the world went, but he would perceive almost intuitively\r\nhow the world intended to go. "Tact, tact, tact," as he was in the\r\nhabit of saying to himself when walking along the paths of his Putney\r\nvilla. Crosbie was now secretary, whereas a few months before he had\r\nbeen simply a clerk; but, nevertheless, Mr. Butterwell\'s instinct\r\ntold him that Crosbie had fallen. Therefore he declined to offer any\r\nsympathy to the man in his misfortune, and felt aware, as he left\r\nthe secretary\'s room, that it might probably be some time before he\r\nvisited it again.\r\n\r\nCrosbie resolved in his soreness that henceforth he would brazen it\r\nout. He would go to the Board, with as much indifference as to his\r\nblack eye as he was able to assume, and if any one said aught to him\r\nhe would be ready with his answer. He would go to his club, and let\r\nhim who intended to show him any slight beware of him in his wrath.\r\nHe could not turn upon John Eames, but he could turn upon others if\r\nit were necessary. He had not gained for himself a position before\r\nthe world, and held it now for some years, to allow himself to be\r\ncrushed at once because he had made a mistake. If the world, his\r\nworld, chose to go to war with him, he would be ready for the fight.\r\nAs for Butterwell,--Butterwell the incompetent, Butterwell the\r\nvapid,--for Butterwell, who in every little official difficulty had\r\nfor years past come to him, he would let Butterwell know what it was\r\nto be thus disloyal to one who had condescended to be his friend. He\r\nwould show them all at the Board that he scorned them, and could be\r\ntheir master. Then, too, as he was making some other resolves as to\r\nhis future conduct, he made one or two resolutions respecting the De\r\nCourcy people. He would make it known to them that he was not going\r\nto be their very humble servant. He would speak out his mind with\r\nconsiderable plainness; and if upon that they should choose to break\r\noff this "alliance," they might do so; he would not break his heart.\r\nAnd as he leaned back in his arm-chair, thinking of all this, an idea\r\nmade its way into his brain,--a floating castle in the air, rather\r\nthan the image of a thing that might by possibility be realized; and\r\nin this castle in the air he saw himself kneeling again at Lily\'s\r\nfeet, asking her pardon, and begging that he might once more be taken\r\nto her heart.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Crosbie is here to-day," said Mr. Butterwell to Mr. Optimist.\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed," said Mr. Optimist, very gravely; for he had heard all\r\nabout the row at the railway station.\r\n\r\n"They\'ve made a monstrous show of him."\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry to hear it. It\'s so--so--so-- If it were one\r\nof the younger clerks, you know, we should tell him that it was\r\ndiscreditable to the department."\r\n\r\n"If a man gets a blow in the eye, he can\'t help it, you know. He\r\ndidn\'t do it himself, I suppose," said Major Fiasco.\r\n\r\n"I am well aware that he didn\'t do it himself," continued Mr.\r\nOptimist; "but I really think that, in his position, he should have\r\nkept himself out of any such encounter."\r\n\r\n"He would have done so if he could, with all his heart," said the\r\nmajor. "I don\'t suppose he liked being thrashed any better than I\r\nshould."\r\n\r\n"Nobody gives me a black eye," said Mr. Optimist.\r\n\r\n"Nobody has as yet," said the major.\r\n\r\n"I hope they never will," said Mr. Butterwell. Then, the hour\r\nfor their meeting having come round, Mr. Crosbie came into the\r\nBoard-room.\r\n\r\n"We have been very sorry to hear of this misfortune," said Mr.\r\nOptimist, very gravely.\r\n\r\n"Not half so sorry as I have been," said Crosbie, with a laugh. "It\'s\r\nan uncommon nuisance to have a black eye, and to go about looking\r\nlike a prize-fighter."\r\n\r\n"And like a prize-fighter that didn\'t win his battle, too," said\r\nFiasco.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that there\'s much difference as to that," said Crosbie.\r\n"But the whole thing is a nuisance, and, if you please, we won\'t say\r\nanything more about it."\r\n\r\nMr. Optimist almost entertained an opinion that it was his duty to\r\nsay something more about it. Was not he the chief Commissioner, and\r\nwas not Mr. Crosbie secretary to the Board? Ought he, looking at\r\ntheir respective positions, to pass over without a word of notice\r\nsuch a manifest impropriety as this? Would not Sir Raffle Buffle have\r\nsaid something had Mr. Butterwell, when secretary, come to the office\r\nwith a black eye? He wished to exercise all the full rights of a\r\nchairman; but, nevertheless, as he looked at the secretary he felt\r\nembarrassed, and was unable to find the proper words. "H--m, ha,\r\nwell; we\'ll go to business now, if you please," he said, as though\r\nreserving to himself the right of returning to the secretary\'s black\r\neye when the more usual business of the Board should be completed.\r\nBut when the more usual business of the Board had been completed, the\r\nsecretary left the room without any further reference to his eye.\r\n\r\nCrosbie, when he got back to his own apartment, found Mortimer\r\nGazebee waiting there for him.\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow," said Gazebee, "this is a very nasty affair."\r\n\r\n"Uncommonly nasty," said Crosbie; "so nasty that I don\'t mean to talk\r\nabout it to anybody."\r\n\r\n"Lady Amelia is quite unhappy." He always called her Lady Amelia,\r\neven when speaking of her to his own brothers and sisters. He was too\r\nwell behaved to take the liberty of calling an earl\'s daughter by her\r\nplain Christian name, even though that earl\'s daughter was his own\r\nwife. "She fears that you have been a good deal hurt."\r\n\r\n"Not at all hurt; but disfigured, as you see."\r\n\r\n"And so you beat the fellow well that did it?"\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t," said Crosbie, very angrily. "I didn\'t beat him at\r\nall. You don\'t believe everything you read in the newspapers, do\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t believe everything. Of course I didn\'t believe about\r\nhis having aspired to an alliance with Lady Alexandrina. That was\r\nuntrue, of course." Mr. Gazebee showed by the tone of his voice that\r\nimprudence so unparalleled as that was quite incredible.\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t believe anything; except this,--that I have got a\r\nblack eye."\r\n\r\n"You certainly have got that. Lady Amelia thinks you would be more\r\ncomfortable if you would come up to us this evening. You can\'t go\r\nout, of course; but Lady Amelia said, very good-naturedly, that you\r\nneed not mind with her."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, no; I\'ll come on Sunday."\r\n\r\n"Of course Lady Alexandrina will be very anxious to hear from her\r\nsister; and Lady Amelia begged me very particularly to press you to\r\ncome."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, no; not to-day."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, simply because I shall be better at home."\r\n\r\n"How can you be better at home? You can have anything that you want.\r\nLady Amelia won\'t mind, you know."\r\n\r\nAnother beefsteak to his eye, as he sat in the drawing-room,\r\na cold-water bandage, or any little medical appliance of that\r\nsort;--these were the things which Lady Amelia would, in her domestic\r\ngood nature, condescend not to mind!\r\n\r\n"I won\'t trouble her this evening," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"Well, upon my word, I think you\'re wrong. All manner of stories will\r\nget down to Courcy Castle, and to the countess\'s ears; and you don\'t\r\nknow what harm may come of it. Lady Amelia thinks she had better\r\nwrite and explain it; but she can\'t do so till she has heard\r\nsomething about it from you."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Gazebee. I don\'t care one straw what story finds its way\r\ndown to Courcy Castle."\r\n\r\n"But if the earl were to hear anything, and be offended?"\r\n\r\n"He may recover from his offence as he best likes."\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow; that\'s talking wildly, you know."\r\n\r\n"What on earth do you suppose the earl can do to me? Do you think\r\nI\'m going to live in fear of Lord De Courcy all my life, because I\'m\r\ngoing to marry his daughter? I shall write to Alexandrina myself\r\nto-day, and you can tell her sister so. I\'ll be up to dinner on\r\nSunday, unless my face makes it altogether out of the question."\r\n\r\n"And you won\'t come in time for church?"\r\n\r\n"Would you have me go to church with such a face as this?"\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Mortimer Gazebee went, and when he got home he told his wife\r\nthat Crosbie was taking things with a high hand. "The fact is, my\r\ndear, that he\'s ashamed of himself, and therefore tries to put a bold\r\nface upon it."\r\n\r\n"It was very foolish of him throwing himself in the way of that young\r\nman,--very; and so I shall tell him on Sunday. If he chooses to give\r\nhimself airs to me, I shall make him understand that he is very\r\nwrong. He should remember now that the way in which he conducts\r\nhimself is a matter of moment to all our family."\r\n\r\n"Of course he should," said Mr. Gazebee.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sunday came the red-streaky period had arrived, but had by\r\nno means as yet passed away. The men at the office had almost become\r\nused to it; but Crosbie, in spite of his determination to go down to\r\nthe club, had not yet shown himself elsewhere. Of course he did not\r\ngo to church, but at five he made his appearance at the house in St.\r\nJohn\'s Wood. They always dined at five on Sundays, having some idea\r\nthat by doing so they kept the Sabbath better than they would have\r\ndone had they dined at seven. If keeping the Sabbath consists in\r\ngoing to bed early, or is in any way assisted by such a practice,\r\nthey were right. To the cook that semi-early dinner might perhaps be\r\nconvenient, as it gave her an excuse for not going to church in the\r\nafternoon, as the servants\' and children\'s dinner gave her a similar\r\nexcuse in the morning. Such little attempts at goodness,--proceeding\r\nhalf the way, or perhaps, as in this instance, one quarter of the\r\nway, on the disagreeable path towards goodness,--are very common with\r\nrespectable people, such as Lady Amelia. If she would have dined at\r\none o\'clock, and have eaten cold meat, one perhaps might have felt\r\nthat she was entitled to some praise.\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear, dear; this is very sad, isn\'t it, Adolphus?" she said on\r\nfirst seeing him.\r\n\r\n"Well, it is sad, Amelia," he said. He always called her Amelia,\r\nbecause she called him Adolphus; but Gazebee himself was never\r\nquite pleased when he heard it. Lady Amelia was older than Crosbie,\r\nand entitled to call him anything she liked; but he should have\r\nremembered the great difference in their rank. "It is sad, Amelia,"\r\nhe said. "But will you oblige me in one thing?"\r\n\r\n"What thing, Adolphus?"\r\n\r\n"Not to say a word more about it. The black eye is a bad thing, no\r\ndoubt, and has troubled me much; but the sympathy of my friends has\r\ntroubled me a great deal more. I had all the family commiseration\r\nfrom Gazebee on Friday, and if it is repeated again, I shall lie down\r\nand die."\r\n\r\n"Shall \'oo die, uncle Dolphus, \'cause \'oo\'ve got a bad eye?" asked De\r\nCourcy Gazebee, the eldest hope of the family, looking up into his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"No, my hero," said Crosbie, taking the boy up into his arms, "not\r\nbecause I\'ve got a black eye. There isn\'t very much harm in that, and\r\nyou\'ll have a great many before you leave school. But because the\r\npeople will go on talking about it."\r\n\r\n"But aunt Dina on\'t like \'oo, if oo\'ve got an ugly bad eye."\r\n\r\n"But, Adolphus," said Lady Amelia, settling herself for an argument,\r\n"that\'s all very well, you know--and I\'m sure I\'m very sorry to cause\r\nyou any annoyance,--but really one doesn\'t know how to pass over such\r\na thing without speaking of it. I have had a letter from mamma."\r\n\r\n"I hope Lady De Courcy is quite well."\r\n\r\n"Quite well, thank you. But as a matter of course she is very anxious\r\nabout this affair. She had read what has been said in the newspapers,\r\nand it may be necessary that Mortimer should take it up, as the\r\nfamily solicitor."\r\n\r\n"Quite out of the question," said Adolphus.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I should advise any such step as that," said Gazebee.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not; very likely not. But you cannot be surprised, Mortimer,\r\nthat my mother under such circumstances should wish to know what are\r\nthe facts of the case."\r\n\r\n"Not at all surprised," said Gazebee.\r\n\r\n"Then once for all, I\'ll tell you the facts. As I got out of the\r\ntrain a man I\'d seen once before in my life made an attack upon me,\r\nand before the police came up, I got a blow in the face. Now you know\r\nall about it."\r\n\r\nAt that moment dinner was announced. "Will you give Lady Amelia your\r\narm?" said the husband.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a very sad occurrence," said Lady Amelia with a slight toss of\r\nher head, "and, I\'m afraid, will cost my sister a great deal of\r\nvexation."\r\n\r\n"You agree with De Courcy, do you, that aunt Dina won\'t like me with\r\nan ugly black eye?"\r\n\r\n"I really don\'t think it\'s a joking matter," said the Lady Amelia.\r\nAnd then there was nothing more said about it during the dinner.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing more said about it during the dinner, but it was\r\nplain enough from Lady Amelia\'s countenance that she was not very\r\nwell pleased with her future brother-in-law\'s conduct. She was very\r\nhospitable to him, pressing him to eat; but even in doing that she\r\nmade repeated little references to his present unfortunate state. She\r\ntold him that she did not think fried plum-pudding would be bad for\r\nhim, but that she would recommend him not to drink port-wine after\r\ndinner. "By-the-by, Mortimer, you\'d better have some claret up," she\r\nremarked. "Adolphus shouldn\'t take anything that is heating."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said Crosbie. "I\'ll have some brandy-and-water, if\r\nGazebee will give it me."\r\n\r\n"Brandy-and-water!" said Lady Amelia. Crosbie in truth was not given\r\nto the drinking of brandy-and-water; but he was prepared to call for\r\nraw gin, if he were driven much further by Lady Amelia\'s solicitude.\r\n\r\nAt these Sunday dinners the mistress of the house never went away\r\ninto the drawing-room, and the tea was always brought into them at\r\nthe table on which they had dined. It was another little step towards\r\nkeeping holy the first day of the week. When Lady Rosina was there,\r\nshe was indulged with the sight of six or seven solid good books\r\nwhich were laid upon the mahogany as soon as the bottles were taken\r\noff it. At her first prolonged visit she had obtained for herself\r\nthe privilege of reading a sermon; but as on such occasions both\r\nLady Amelia and Mr. Gazebee would go to sleep,--and as the footman\r\nhad also once shown a tendency that way,--the sermon had been\r\nabandoned. But the master of the house, on these evenings, when his\r\nsister-in-law was present, was doomed to sit in idleness, or else to\r\nfind solace in one of the solid good books. But Lady Rosina just now\r\nwas in the country, and therefore the table was left unfurnished.\r\n\r\n"And what am I to say to my mother?" said Lady Amelia, when they were\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n"Give her my kindest regards," said Crosbie. It was quite clear, both\r\nto the husband and to the wife, that he was preparing himself for\r\nrebellion against authority.\r\n\r\nFor some ten minutes there was nothing said. Crosbie amused himself\r\nby playing with the boy whom he called Dicksey, by way of a nickname\r\nfor De Courcy.\r\n\r\n"Mamma, he calls me Dicksey. Am I Dicksey? I\'ll call \'oo old Cross,\r\nand then aunt Dina \'on\'t like \'oo."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would not call the child nicknames, Adolphus. It seems as\r\nthough you would wish to cast a slur upon the one which he bears."\r\n\r\n"I should hardly think that he would feel disposed to do that," said\r\nMr. Gazebee.\r\n\r\n"Hardly, indeed," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"It has never yet been disgraced in the annals of our country by\r\nbeing made into a nickname," said the proud daughter of the house.\r\nShe was probably unaware that among many of his associates her father\r\nhad been called Lord De Curse\'ye, from the occasional energy of\r\nhis language. "And any such attempt is painful in my ears. I think\r\nsomething of my family, I can assure you, Adolphus, and so does my\r\nhusband."\r\n\r\n"A very great deal," said Mr. Gazebee.\r\n\r\n"So do I of mine," said Crosbie. "That\'s natural to all of us. One of\r\nmy ancestors came over with William the Conqueror. I think he was one\r\nof the assistant cooks in the king\'s tent."\r\n\r\n"A cook!" said young De Courcy.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my boy, a cook. That was the way most of our old families were\r\nmade noble. They were cooks, or butlers to the kings--or sometimes\r\nsomething worse."\r\n\r\n"But your family isn\'t noble?"\r\n\r\n"No--I\'ll tell you how that was. The king wanted this cook to poison\r\nhalf-a-dozen of his officers who wished to have a way of their\r\nown; but the cook said, \'No, my Lord King; I am a cook, not an\r\nexecutioner.\' So they sent him into the scullery, and when they\r\ncalled all the other servants barons and lords, they only called him\r\nCookey. They\'ve changed the name to Crosbie since that, by degrees."\r\n\r\nMr. Gazebee was awestruck, and the face of the Lady Amelia became\r\nvery dark. Was it not evident that this snake, when taken into their\r\ninnermost bosoms that they might there warm him, was becoming an\r\nadder, and preparing to sting them? There was very little more\r\nconversation that evening, and soon after the story of the cook,\r\nCrosbie got up and went away to his own home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n"SEE, THE CONQUERING HERO COMES."\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Eames had reached his office precisely at twelve o\'clock,\r\nbut when he did so he hardly knew whether he was standing on his\r\nheels or his head. The whole morning had been to him one of intense\r\nexcitement, and latterly, to a certain extent, one of triumph. But\r\nhe did not at all know what might be the results. Would he be taken\r\nbefore a magistrate and locked up? Would there be a row at the\r\noffice? Would Crosbie call him out, and, if so, would it be incumbent\r\non him to fight a duel with pistols? What would Lord De Guest\r\nsay--Lord De Guest, who had specially warned him not to take upon\r\nhimself the duty of avenging Lily\'s wrongs? What would all the Dale\r\nfamily say of his conduct? And, above all, what would Lily say and\r\nthink? Nevertheless, the feeling of triumph was predominant; and now,\r\nat this interval of time, he was beginning to remember with pleasure\r\nthe sensation of his fist as it went into Crosbie\'s eye.\r\n\r\nDuring his first day at the office he heard nothing about the affair,\r\nnor did he say a word of it to any one. It was known in his room that\r\nhe had gone down to spend his Christmas holiday with Lord De Guest,\r\nand he was treated with some increased consideration accordingly.\r\nAnd, moreover, I must explain, in order that I may give Johnny Eames\r\nhis due, he was gradually acquiring for himself a good footing\r\namong the Income-tax officials. He knew his work, and did it with\r\nsome manly confidence in his own powers, and also with some manly\r\nindifference to the occasional frowns of the mighty men of the\r\ndepartment. He was, moreover, popular--being somewhat of a radical\r\nin his official demeanour, and holding by his own rights, even\r\nthough mighty men should frown. In truth, he was emerging from his\r\nhobbledehoyhood and entering upon his young manhood, having probably\r\nto go through much folly and some false sentiment in that period of\r\nhis existence, but still with fair promise of true manliness beyond,\r\nto those who were able to read the signs of his character.\r\n\r\nMany questions on that first day were asked him about the glories of\r\nhis Christmas, but he had very little to say on the subject. Indeed\r\nnothing could have been much more commonplace than his Christmas\r\nvisit, had it not been for the one great object which had taken him\r\ndown to that part of the country, and for the circumstance with which\r\nhis holiday had been ended. On neither of these subjects was he\r\ndisposed to speak openly; but as he walked home to Burton Crescent\r\nwith Cradell, he did tell him of the affair with Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"And you went in at him on the station?" asked Cradell, with admiring\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: "And you went in at him on the station?"]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Yes, I did. If I didn\'t do it there, where was I to do it? I\'d\r\nsaid I would, and therefore when I saw him I did it." Then the\r\nwhole affair was told as to the black eye, the police, and the\r\nsuperintendent. "And what\'s to come next?" asked our hero.\r\n\r\n"Well, he\'ll put it in the hands of a friend, of course; as I did\r\nwith Fisher in that affair with Lupex. And, upon my word, Johnny, I\r\nshall have to do something of the kind again. His conduct last night\r\nwas outrageous; would you believe it--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'s a fool."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a fool you wouldn\'t like to meet when he\'s in one of his mad\r\nfits, I can tell you that. I absolutely had to sit up in my own\r\nbedroom all last night. Mother Roper told me that if I remained in\r\nthe drawing-room she would feel herself obliged to have a policeman\r\nin the house. What could I do, you know? I made her have a fire for\r\nme, of course."\r\n\r\n"And then you went to bed."\r\n\r\n"I waited ever so long, because I thought that Maria would want to\r\nsee me. At last she sent me a note. Maria is so imprudent, you know.\r\nIf he had found anything in her writing, it would have been terrible,\r\nyou know,--quite terrible. And who can say whether Jemima mayn\'t\r\ntell?"\r\n\r\n"And what did she say?"\r\n\r\n"Come; that\'s tellings, Master Johnny. I took very good care to take\r\nit with me to the office this morning, for fear of accidents."\r\n\r\nBut Eames was not so widely awake to the importance of his friend\'s\r\nadventures as he might have been had he not been weighted with\r\nadventures of his own.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t care so much," said he, "about that fellow Crosbie going\r\nto a friend, as I should about his going to a police magistrate."\r\n\r\n"He\'ll put it in a friend\'s hands, of course," said Cradell, with the\r\nair of a man who from experience was well up in such matters. "And I\r\nsuppose you\'ll naturally come to me. It\'s a deuced bore to a man in a\r\npublic office, and all that kind of thing, of course. But I\'m not the\r\nman to desert my friend. I\'ll stand by you, Johnny, my boy."\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you," said Eames, "I don\'t think that I shall want that."\r\n\r\n"You must be ready with a friend, you know."\r\n\r\n"I should write down to a man I know in the country, and ask his\r\nadvice," said Eames; "an older sort of friend, you know."\r\n\r\n"By Jove, old fellow, take care what you\'re about. Don\'t let them say\r\nof you that you show the white feather. Upon my honour, I\'d sooner\r\nhave anything said of me than that. I would, indeed,--anything."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not afraid of that," said Eames, with a touch of scorn\r\nin his voice. "There isn\'t much thought about white feathers\r\nnow-a-days,--not in the way of fighting duels."\r\n\r\nAfter that, Cradell managed to carry back the conversation to Mrs.\r\nLupex and his own peculiar position, and as Eames did not care to ask\r\nfrom his companion further advice in his own matters, he listened\r\nnearly in silence till they reached Burton Crescent.\r\n\r\n"I hope you found the noble earl well," said Mrs. Roper to him, as\r\nsoon as they were all seated at dinner.\r\n\r\n"I found the noble earl pretty well, thank you," said Johnny.\r\n\r\nIt had become plainly understood by all the Roperites that Eames\'s\r\nposition was quite altered since he had been honoured with the\r\nfriendship of Lord De Guest. Mrs. Lupex, next to whom he always\r\nsat at dinner, with a view to protecting her as it were from the\r\ndangerous neighbourhood of Cradell, treated him with a marked\r\ncourtesy. Miss Spruce always called him "sir." Mrs. Roper helped him\r\nthe first of the gentlemen, and was mindful about his fat and gravy,\r\nand Amelia felt less able than she was before to insist upon the\r\npossession of his heart and affections. It must not be supposed that\r\nAmelia intended to abandon the fight, and allow the enemy to walk off\r\nwith his forces; but she felt herself constrained to treat him with a\r\ndeference that was hardly compatible with the perfect equality which\r\nshould attend any union of hearts.\r\n\r\n"It is such a privilege to be on visiting terms with the nobility,"\r\nsaid Mrs. Lupex. "When I was a girl, I used to be very intimate--"\r\n\r\n"You ain\'t a girl any longer, and so you\'d better not talk about it,"\r\nsaid Lupex. Mr. Lupex had been at that little shop in Drury Lane\r\nafter he came down from his scene-painting.\r\n\r\n"My dear, you needn\'t be a brute to me before all Mrs. Roper\'s\r\ncompany. If, led away by feelings which I will not now describe, I\r\nleft my proper circles in marrying you, you need not before all the\r\nworld teach me how much I have to regret." And Mrs. Lupex, putting\r\ndown her knife and fork, applied her handkerchief to her eyes.\r\n\r\n"That\'s pleasant for a man over his meals, isn\'t it?" said Lupex,\r\nappealing to Miss Spruce. "I have plenty of that kind of thing, and\r\nyou can\'t think how I like it."\r\n\r\n"Them whom God has joined together, let no man put asunder," said\r\nMiss Spruce. "As for me myself, I\'m only an old woman."\r\n\r\nThis little ebullition threw a gloom over the dinner-table, and\r\nnothing more was said on the occasion as to the glories of Eames\'s\r\ncareer. But, in the course of the evening, Amelia heard of the\r\nencounter which had taken place at the railway station, and at once\r\nperceived that she might use the occasion for her own purposes.\r\n\r\n"John," she whispered to her victim, finding an opportunity for\r\ncoming upon him when almost alone, "what is this I hear? I insist\r\nupon knowing. Are you going to fight a duel?"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"But it is not nonsense. You don\'t know what my feelings will be, if\r\nI think that such a thing is going to happen. But then you are so\r\nhard-hearted!"\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t hard-hearted a bit, and I\'m not going to fight a duel."\r\n\r\n"But is it true that you beat Mr. Crosbie at the station?"\r\n\r\n"It is true. I did beat him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, John! not that I mean to say you were wrong, and indeed I honour\r\nyou for the feeling. There can be nothing so dreadful as a young\r\nman\'s deceiving a young woman and leaving her after he has won her\r\nheart--particularly when she has had his promise in plain words,\r\nor, perhaps, even in black and white." John thought of that horrid,\r\nfoolish, wretched note which he had written. "And a poor girl, if she\r\ncan\'t right herself by a breach of promise, doesn\'t know what to do.\r\nDoes she, John?"\r\n\r\n"A girl who\'d right herself that way wouldn\'t be worth having."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about that. When a poor girl is in such a position, she\r\nhas to be aided by her friends. I suppose, then, Miss Lily Dale won\'t\r\nbring a breach of promise against him."\r\n\r\nThis mention of Lily\'s name in such a place was sacrilege in the ears\r\nof poor Eames. "I cannot tell," said he, "what may be the intention\r\nof the lady of whom you speak. But from what I know of her friends, I\r\nshould not think that she will be disgraced by such a proceeding."\r\n\r\n"That may be all very well for Miss Lily Dale--" Amelia said, and\r\nthen she hesitated. It would not be well, she thought, absolutely to\r\nthreaten him as yet,--not as long as there was any possibility that\r\nhe might be won without a threat. "Of course I know all about it,"\r\nshe continued. "She was your L. D., you know. Not that I was ever\r\njealous of her. To you she was no more than one of childhood\'s\r\nfriends. Was she, Johnny?"\r\n\r\nHe stamped his foot upon the floor, and then jumped up from his seat.\r\n"I hate all that sort of twaddle about childhood\'s friends, and you\r\nknow I do. You\'ll make me swear that I\'ll never come into this room\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"Johnny!"\r\n\r\n"So I will. The whole thing makes me sick. And as for that Mrs.\r\nLupex--"\r\n\r\n"If this is what you learn, John, by going to a lord\'s house, I think\r\nyou had better stay at home with your own friends."\r\n\r\n"Of course I had;--much better stay at home with my own friends.\r\nHere\'s Mrs. Lupex, and at any rate I can\'t stand her." So he went\r\noff, and walked round the Crescent, and down to the New Road, and\r\nalmost into the Regent\'s Park, thinking of Lily Dale and of his own\r\ncowardice with Amelia Roper.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning he received a message, at about one o\'clock,\r\nby the mouth of the Board-room messenger, informing him that his\r\npresence was required in the Board-room. "Sir Raffle Buffle has\r\ndesired your presence, Mr. Eames."\r\n\r\n"My presence, Tupper! what for?" said Johnny, turning upon the\r\nmessenger almost with dismay.\r\n\r\n"Indeed I can\'t say, Mr. Eames; but Sir Raffle Buffle has desired\r\nyour presence in the Board-room."\r\n\r\nSuch a message as that in official life always strikes awe into the\r\nheart of a young man. And yet, young men generally come forth from\r\nsuch interviews without having received any serious damage, and\r\ngenerally talk about the old gentlemen whom they have encountered\r\nwith a good deal of light-spirited sarcasm,--or chaff, as it is\r\ncalled in the slang phraseology of the day. It is that same "majesty\r\nwhich doth hedge a king" that does it. The turkey-cock in his own\r\nfarmyard is master of the occasion, and the thought of him creates\r\nfear. A bishop in his lawn, a judge on the bench, a chairman in\r\nthe big room at the end of a long table, or a policeman with his\r\nbull\'s-eye lamp upon his beat, can all make themselves terrible by\r\nmeans of those appanages of majesty which have been vouchsafed to\r\nthem. But how mean is the policeman in his own home, and how few\r\nthought much of Sir Raffle Buffle as he sat asleep after dinner in\r\nhis old slippers! How well can I remember the terror created within\r\nme by the air of outraged dignity with which a certain fine old\r\ngentleman, now long since gone, could rub his hands slowly, one on\r\nthe other, and look up to the ceiling, slightly shaking his head, as\r\nthough lost in the contemplation of my iniquities! I would become\r\nsick in my stomach, and feel as though my ankles had been broken.\r\nThat upward turn of the eye unmanned me so completely that I was\r\nspeechless as regarded any defence. I think that that old man could\r\nhardly have known the extent of his own power.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time a careless lad, having the charge of a bundle of\r\nletters addressed to the King,--petitions and such like, which\r\nin the course of business would not get beyond the hands of some\r\nlord-in-waiting\'s deputy assistant,--sent the bag which contained\r\nthem to the wrong place; to Windsor, perhaps, if the Court were in\r\nLondon; or to St. James\'s, if it were at Windsor. He was summoned;\r\nand the great man of the occasion contented himself with holding his\r\nhands up to the heavens as he stood up from his chair, and exclaiming\r\ntwice, "Mis-sent the Monarch\'s pouch! Mis-sent the Monarch\'s pouch!"\r\nThat young man never knew how he escaped from the Board-room; but for\r\na time he was deprived of all power of exertion, and could not resume\r\nhis work till he had had six months\' leave of absence, and been\r\nbrought round upon rum and asses\' milk. In that instance the peculiar\r\nuse of the word Monarch had a power which the official magnate had\r\nnever contemplated. The story is traditional; but I believe that the\r\ncircumstance happened as lately as in the days of George the Third.\r\n\r\nJohn Eames could laugh at the present chairman of the Income-tax\r\nOffice with great freedom, and call him old Huffle Scuffle, and the\r\nlike; but now that he was sent for, he also, in spite of his radical\r\npropensities, felt a little weak about his ankle joints. He knew,\r\nfrom the first hearing of the message, that he was wanted with\r\nreference to that affair at the railway station. Perhaps there might\r\nbe a rule that any clerk should be dismissed who used his fists in\r\nany public place. There were many rules entailing the punishment\r\nof dismissal for many offences,--and he began to think that he did\r\nremember something of such a regulation. However, he got up, looked\r\nonce around him upon his friends, and then followed Tupper into the\r\nBoard-room.\r\n\r\n"There\'s Johnny been sent for by old Scuffles," said one clerk.\r\n\r\n"That\'s about his row with Crosbie," said another. "The Board can\'t\r\ndo anything to him for that."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t it?" said the first. "Didn\'t young Outonites have to resign\r\nbecause of that row at the Cider Cellars, though his cousin, Sir\r\nConstant Outonites, did all that he could for him?"\r\n\r\n"But he was regularly up the spout with accommodation bills."\r\n\r\n"I tell you that I wouldn\'t be in Eames\'s shoes for a trifle. Crosbie\r\nis secretary at the Committee Office, where Scuffles was chairman\r\nbefore he came here; and of course they\'re as thick as thieves. I\r\nshouldn\'t wonder if they didn\'t make him go down and apologize."\r\n\r\n"Johnny won\'t do that," said the other.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime John Eames was standing in the august presence. Sir\r\nRaffle Buffle was throned in his great oak arm-chair at the head of\r\na long table in a very large room; and by him, at the corner of the\r\ntable, was seated one of the assistant secretaries of the office.\r\nAnother member of the Board was also at work upon the long table; but\r\nhe was reading and signing papers at some distance from Sir Raffle,\r\nand paid no heed whatever to the scene. The assistant secretary,\r\nlooking on, could see that Sir Raffle was annoyed by this want of\r\nattention on the part of his colleague, but all this was lost upon\r\nEames.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Eames?" said Sir Raffle, speaking with a peculiarly harsh voice,\r\nand looking at the culprit through a pair of gold-rimmed glasses,\r\nwhich he perched for the occasion upon his big nose. "Isn\'t that Mr.\r\nEames?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the assistant secretary, "this is Eames."\r\n\r\n"Ah!"--and then there was a pause. "Come a little nearer, Mr. Eames,\r\nwill you?" and Johnny drew nearer, advancing noiselessly over the\r\nTurkey carpet.\r\n\r\n"Let me see; in the second class, isn\'t he? Ah! Do you know,\r\nMr. Eames, that I have received a letter from the secretary to\r\nthe Directors of the Great Western Railway Company, detailing\r\ncircumstances which,--if truly stated in that letter,--redound very\r\nmuch to your discredit?"\r\n\r\n"I did get into a row there yesterday, sir."\r\n\r\n"Got into a row! It seems to me that you have got into a very serious\r\nrow, and that I must tell the Directors of the Great Western Railway\r\nCompany that the law must be allowed to take its course."\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t mind that, sir, in the least," said Eames, brightening up a\r\nlittle under this view of the case.\r\n\r\n"Not mind that, sir!" said Sir Raffle--or rather, he shouted out\r\nthe words at the offender before him. I am inclined to think that\r\nhe overdid it, missing the effect which a milder tone might have\r\nattained. Perhaps there was lacking to him some of that majesty\r\nof demeanour and dramatic propriety of voice which had been so\r\nefficacious in the little story as to the King\'s bag of letters.\r\nAs it was, Johnny gave a slight jump, but after his jump he felt\r\nbetter than he had been before. "Not mind, sir, being dragged before\r\nthe criminal tribunals of your country, and being punished as a\r\nfelon,--or rather as a misdemeanour,--for an outrage committed on a\r\npublic platform! Not mind it! What do you mean, sir?"\r\n\r\n"I mean, that I don\'t think the magistrate would say very much about\r\nit, sir. And I don\'t think Mr. Crosbie would come forward."\r\n\r\n"But Mr. Crosbie must come forward, young man. Do you suppose that\r\nan outrage against the peace of the Metropolis is to go unpunished\r\nbecause he may not wish to pursue the matter? I\'m afraid you must be\r\nvery ignorant, young man."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I am," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"Very ignorant indeed,--very ignorant indeed. And are you aware, sir,\r\nthat it would become a question with the Commissioners of this Board\r\nwhether you could be retained in the service of this department if\r\nyou were publicly punished by a police magistrate for such a\r\ndisgraceful outrage as that?"\r\n\r\nJohnny looked round at the other Commissioner, but that gentleman did\r\nnot raise his face from his papers.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Eames is a very good clerk," whispered the assistant secretary,\r\nbut in a voice which made his words audible to Eames; "one of the\r\nbest young men we have," he added, in a voice which was not audible.\r\n\r\n"Oh,--ah; very well. Now, I\'ll tell you what, Mr. Eames, I hope this\r\nwill be a lesson to you,--a very serious lesson."\r\n\r\nThe assistant secretary, leaning back in his chair so as to be a\r\nlittle behind the head of Sir Raffle, did manage to catch the eye of\r\nthe other Commissioner. The other Commissioner, barely looking round,\r\nsmiled a little, and then the assistant secretary smiled also. Eames\r\nsaw this, and he smiled too.\r\n\r\n"Whether any ulterior consequences may still await the breach of the\r\npeace of which you have been guilty, I am not yet prepared to say,"\r\ncontinued Sir Raffle. "You may go now."\r\n\r\nAnd Johnny returned to his own place, with no increased reverence for\r\nthe dignity of the chairman.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning one of his colleagues showed him with great\r\nglee the passage in the newspaper which informed the world that he\r\nhad been so desperately beaten by Crosbie that he was obliged to keep\r\nhis bed at this present time in consequence of the flogging that\r\nhe had received. Then his anger was aroused, and he bounced about\r\nthe big room of the Income-tax Office, regardless of assistant\r\nsecretaries, head clerks, and all other official grandees whatsoever,\r\ndenouncing the iniquities of the public press, and declaring his\r\nopinion that it would be better to live in Russia than in a country\r\nwhich allowed such audacious falsehoods to be propagated.\r\n\r\n"He never touched me, Fisher; I don\'t think he ever tried; but, upon\r\nmy honour, he never touched me."\r\n\r\n"But, Johnny, it was bold in you to make up to Lord De Courcy\'s\r\ndaughter," said Fisher.\r\n\r\n"I never saw one of them in my life."\r\n\r\n"He\'s going it altogether among the aristocracy, now," said another;\r\n"I suppose you wouldn\'t look at anybody under a viscount?"\r\n\r\n"Can I help what that thief of an editor puts into his paper?\r\nFlogged! Huffle Scuffle told me I was a felon, but that wasn\'t half\r\nso bad as this fellow;" and Johnny kicked the newspaper across the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"Indict him for a libel," said Fisher.\r\n\r\n"Particularly for saying you wanted to marry a countess\'s daughter,"\r\nsaid another clerk.\r\n\r\n"I never heard such a scandal in my life," declared a third; "and\r\nthen to say that the girl wouldn\'t look at you."\r\n\r\nBut not the less was it felt by all in the office that Johnny Eames\r\nwas becoming a leading man among them, and that he was one with whom\r\neach of them would be pleased to be intimate. And even among the\r\ngrandees this affair of the railway station did him no real harm. It\r\nwas known that Crosbie had deserved to be thrashed, and known that\r\nEames had thrashed him. It was all very well for Sir Raffle Buffle to\r\ntalk of police magistrates and misdemeanours, but all the world at\r\nthe Income-tax Office knew very well that Eames had come out from\r\nthat affair with his head upright, and his right foot foremost.\r\n\r\n"Never mind about the newspaper," a thoughtful old senior clerk said\r\nto him. "As he did get the licking and you didn\'t, you can afford to\r\nlaugh at the newspaper."\r\n\r\n"And you wouldn\'t write to the editor?"\r\n\r\n"No, no; certainly not. No one thinks of defending himself to a\r\nnewspaper except an ass;--unless it be some fellow who wants to have\r\nhis name puffed. You may write what\'s as true as the gospel, but\r\nthey\'ll know how to make fun of it."\r\n\r\nJohnny therefore gave up his idea of an indignant letter to the\r\neditor, but he felt that he was bound to give some explanation of\r\nthe whole matter to Lord De Guest. The affair had happened as he was\r\ncoming from the earl\'s house, and all his own concerns had now been\r\nmade so much a matter of interest to his kind friend, that he thought\r\nthat he could not with propriety leave the earl to learn from the\r\nnewspapers either the facts or the falsehoods. And, therefore, before\r\nhe left his office he wrote the following letter:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Income-tax Office, December 29, 186--.\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,--\r\n\r\n\r\nHe thought a good deal about the style in which he ought to address\r\nthe peer, never having hitherto written to him. He began, "My dear\r\nLord," on one sheet of paper, and then put it aside, thinking that it\r\nlooked over-bold.\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY LORD,--\r\n\r\n   As you have been so very kind to me, I feel that I ought\r\n   to tell you what happened the other morning at the railway\r\n   station, as I was coming back from Guestwick. That\r\n   scoundrel Crosbie got into the same carriage with me at\r\n   the Barchester Junction, and sat opposite to me all the\r\n   way up to London. I did not speak a word to him, or he\r\n   to me; but when he got out at the Paddington Station, I\r\n   thought I ought not to let him go away, so I-- I can\'t\r\n   say that I thrashed him as I wished to do; but I made an\r\n   attempt, and I did give him a black eye. A whole quantity\r\n   of policemen got round us, and I hadn\'t a fair chance. I\r\n   know you will think that I was wrong, and perhaps I was;\r\n   but what could I do when he sat opposite to me there for\r\n   two hours, looking as though he thought himself the finest\r\n   fellow in all London?\r\n\r\n   They\'ve put a horrible paragraph into one of the\r\n   newspapers, saying that I got so "flogged" that I haven\'t\r\n   been able to stir since. It is an atrocious falsehood,\r\n   as is all the rest of the newspaper account. I was not\r\n   touched. He was not nearly so bad a customer as the\r\n   bull, and seemed to take it all very quietly. I must\r\n   acknowledge, though, that he didn\'t get such a beating as\r\n   he deserved.\r\n\r\n   Your friend Sir R. B. sent for me this morning, and told\r\n   me I was a felon. I didn\'t seem to care much for that, for\r\n   he might as well have called me a murderer or a burglar;\r\n   but I shall care very much indeed if I have made you angry\r\n   with me. But what I most fear is the anger of some one\r\n   else,--at Allington.\r\n\r\n   Believe me to be, my Lord,\r\n   Yours very much obliged and most sincerely,\r\n\r\n   JOHN EAMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I knew he\'d do it if ever he got the opportunity," said the\r\nearl when he had read his letter; and he walked about his room\r\nstriking his hands together, and then thrusting his thumbs into his\r\nwaistcoat-pockets. "I knew he was made of the right stuff," and the\r\nearl rejoiced greatly in the prowess of his favourite. "I\'d have done\r\nit myself if I\'d seen him. I do believe I would." Then he went back\r\nto the breakfast-room and told Lady Julia. "What do you think?" said\r\nhe; "Johnny Eames has come across Crosbie, and given him a desperate\r\nbeating."\r\n\r\n"No!" said Lady Julia, putting down her newspaper and spectacles, and\r\nexpressing by the light of her eyes anything but Christian horror at\r\nthe wickedness of the deed.\r\n\r\n"But he has, though. I knew he would if he saw him."\r\n\r\n"Beaten him! Actually beaten him!"\r\n\r\n"Sent him home to Lady Alexandrina with two black eyes."\r\n\r\n"Two black eyes! What a young pickle! But did he get hurt himself?"\r\n\r\n"Not a scratch, he says."\r\n\r\n"And what\'ll they do to him?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing. Crosbie won\'t be fool enough to do anything. A man becomes\r\nan outlaw when he plays such a game as he has played. Anybody\'s hand\r\nmay be raised against him with impunity. He can\'t show his face, you\r\nknow. He can\'t come forward and answer questions as to what he has\r\ndone. There are offences which the law can\'t touch, but which outrage\r\npublic feeling so strongly that any one may take upon himself the\r\nduty of punishing them. He has been thrashed, and that will stick to\r\nhim till he dies."\r\n\r\n"Do tell Johnny from me that I hope he didn\'t get hurt," said Lady\r\nJulia. The old lady could not absolutely congratulate him on his feat\r\nof arms, but she did the next thing to it.\r\n\r\nBut the earl did congratulate him, with a full open assurance of his\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n"I hope," he said, "I should have done the same at your age, under\r\nsimilar circumstances, and I\'m very glad that he proved less\r\ndifficult than the bull. I\'m quite sure you didn\'t want any one to\r\nhelp you with Master Crosbie. As for that other person at Allington,\r\nif I understand such matters at all, I think she will forgive you."\r\nIt may, however, be a question whether the earl did understand such\r\nmatters at all. And then he added, in a postscript: "When you write\r\nto me again,--and don\'t be long first, begin your letter, \'My dear\r\nLord De Guest,\'--that is the proper way."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nAN OLD MAN\'S COMPLAINT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: (untitled)]\r\n\r\n"Have you been thinking again of what I was saying to you, Bell?"\r\nBernard said to his cousin one morning.\r\n\r\n"Thinking of it, Bernard? Why should I think more of it? I had hoped\r\nthat you had forgotten it yourself."\r\n\r\n"No," he said; "I am not so easy-hearted as that. I cannot look on\r\nsuch a thing as I would the purchase of a horse, which I could give\r\nup without sorrow if I found that the animal was too costly for my\r\npurse. I did not tell you that I loved you till I was sure of myself,\r\nand having made myself sure I cannot change at all."\r\n\r\n"And yet you would have me change."\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course I would. If your heart be free now, it must of course\r\nbe changed before you come to love any man. Such change as that is to\r\nbe looked for. But when you have loved, then it will not be easy to\r\nchange you."\r\n\r\n"But I have not."\r\n\r\n"Then I have a right to hope. I have been hanging on here, Bell,\r\nlonger than I ought to have done, because I could not bring myself to\r\nleave you without speaking of this again. I did not wish to seem to\r\nyou to be importunate--"\r\n\r\n"If you could only believe me in what I say."\r\n\r\n"It is not that I do not believe. I am not a puppy or a fool, to\r\nflatter myself that you must be in love with me. I believe you well\r\nenough. But still it is possible that your mind may alter."\r\n\r\n"It is impossible."\r\n\r\n"I do not know whether my uncle or your mother have spoken to you\r\nabout this."\r\n\r\n"Such speaking would have no effect."\r\n\r\nIn fact, her mother had spoken to her, but she truly said that such\r\nspeaking would have no effect. If her cousin could not win the battle\r\nby his own skill, he might have been quite sure, looking at her\r\ncharacter as it was known to him, that he would not be able to win it\r\nby the skill of others.\r\n\r\n"We have all been made very unhappy," he went on to say, "by this\r\ncalamity which has fallen on poor Lily."\r\n\r\n"And because she has been deceived by the man she did love, I am to\r\nmake matters square by marrying a man I--" and then she paused. "Dear\r\nBernard, you should not drive me to say words which will sound harsh\r\nto you."\r\n\r\n"No words can be harsher than those which you have already spoken.\r\nBut, Bell, at any rate, you may listen to me."\r\n\r\nThen he told her how desirable it was with reference to all the\r\nconcerns of the Dale family that she should endeavour to look\r\nfavourably on his proposition. It would be good for them all, he\r\nsaid, especially for Lily, as to whom, at the present moment, their\r\nuncle felt so kindly. He, as Bernard pleaded, was so anxious at heart\r\nfor this marriage, that he would do anything that was asked of him\r\nif he were gratified. But if he were not gratified in this, he would\r\nfeel that he had ground for displeasure.\r\n\r\nBell, as she had been desired to listen, did listen very patiently.\r\nBut when her cousin had finished, her answer was very short. "Nothing\r\nthat my uncle can say, or think, or do, can make any difference in\r\nthis," said she.\r\n\r\n"You will think nothing, then, of the happiness of others."\r\n\r\n"I would not marry a man I did not love, to ensure any amount of\r\nhappiness to others;--at least I know I ought not to do so. But I\r\ndo not believe I should ensure any one\'s happiness by this marriage.\r\nCertainly not yours."\r\n\r\nAfter this Bernard had acknowledged to himself that the difficulties\r\nin his way were great. "I will go away till next autumn," he said to\r\nhis uncle.\r\n\r\n"If you would give up your profession and remain here, she would not\r\nbe so perverse."\r\n\r\n"I cannot do that, sir. I cannot risk the well-being of my life on\r\nsuch a chance." Then his uncle had been angry with him, as well as\r\nwith his niece. In his anger he determined that he would go again to\r\nhis sister-in-law, and, after some unreasonable fashion, he resolved\r\nthat it would become him to be very angry with her also, if she\r\ndeclined to assist him with all her influence as a mother.\r\n\r\n"Why should they not both marry?" he said to himself. Lord De Guest\'s\r\noffer as to young Eames had been very generous. As he had then\r\ndeclared, he had not been able to express his own opinion at once;\r\nbut on thinking over what the earl had said, he had found himself\r\nvery willing to heal the family wound in the manner proposed, if any\r\nsuch healing might be possible. That, however, could not be done\r\nquite as yet. When the time should come, and he thought it might come\r\nsoon,--perhaps in the spring, when the days should be fine and the\r\nevenings again long,--he would be willing to take his share with the\r\nearl in establishing that new household. To Crosbie he had refused to\r\ngive anything, and there was upon his conscience a shade of remorse\r\nin that he had so refused. But if Lily could be brought to love this\r\nother man, he would be more open-handed. She should have her share\r\nas though she was in fact his daughter. But then, if he intended\r\nto do so much for them at the Small House, should not they in\r\nreturn do something also for him? So thinking, he went again to his\r\nsister-in-law, determined to explain his views, even though it might\r\nbe at the risk of some hard words between them. As regarded himself,\r\nhe did not much care for hard words spoken to him. He almost expected\r\nthat people\'s words should be hard and painful. He did not look for\r\nthe comfort of affectionate soft greetings, and perhaps would not\r\nhave appreciated them had they come to him. He caught Mrs. Dale\r\nwalking in the garden, and brought her into his own room, feeling\r\nthat he had a better chance there than in her own house. She, with an\r\nold dislike to being lectured in that room, had endeavoured to avoid\r\nthe interview, but had failed.\r\n\r\n"So I met John Eames at the manor," he had said to her in the garden.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; and how did he get on there? I cannot conceive poor Johnny\r\nkeeping holiday with the earl and his sister. How did he behave to\r\nthem, and how did they behave to him?"\r\n\r\n"I can assure you he was very much at home there."\r\n\r\n"Was he, indeed? Well, I hope it will do him good. He is, I\'m sure, a\r\nvery good young man; only rather awkward."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t think him awkward at all. You\'ll find, Mary, that he\'ll do\r\nvery well;--a great deal better than his father did."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I hope he may." After that Mrs. Dale made her attempt to\r\nescape; but the squire had taken her prisoner, and led her captive\r\ninto the house. "Mary," he said, as soon as he had induced her to sit\r\ndown, "it is time that this should be settled between my nephew and\r\nniece."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid there will be nothing to settle."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean;--that you disapprove of it?"\r\n\r\n"By no means,--personally. I should approve of it very strongly. But\r\nthat has nothing to do with the question."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it has. I beg your pardon, but it must have, and should have\r\na great deal to do with it. Of course, I am not saying that anybody\r\nshould now ever be compelled to marry anybody."\r\n\r\n"I hope not."\r\n\r\n"I never said that they ought, and never thought so. But I do think\r\nthat the wishes of all her family should have very great weight with\r\na girl that has been well brought up."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whether Bell has been well brought up; but in such a\r\nmatter as this nobody\'s wishes would weigh a feather with her; and,\r\nindeed, I could not take upon myself even to express a wish. To you I\r\ncan say that I should have been very happy if she could have regarded\r\nher cousin as you wish her to do."\r\n\r\n"You mean that you are afraid to tell her so?"\r\n\r\n"I am afraid to do what I think is wrong, if you mean that."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it would be wrong, and therefore I shall speak to her\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"You must do as you like about that, Mr. Dale; I can\'t prevent you. I\r\nshall think you wrong to harass her on such a matter, and I fear also\r\nthat her answer will not be satisfactory to you. If you choose to\r\ntell her your opinion, you must do so. Of course I shall think you\r\nwrong, that\'s all."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale\'s voice as she said this was stern enough, and so was her\r\ncountenance. She could not forbid the uncle to speak his mind to his\r\nniece, but she especially disliked the idea of any interference with\r\nher daughter. The squire got up and walked about the room, trying\r\nto compose himself that he might answer her rationally, but without\r\nanger.\r\n\r\n"May I go now?" said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"May you go? Of course you may go if you like it. If you think that\r\nI am intruding upon you in speaking to you of the welfare of your two\r\ngirls, whom I endeavour to regard as my own daughters,--except in\r\nthis, that I know they have never been taught to love me,--if you\r\nthink that it is an interference on my part to show anxiety for their\r\nwelfare, of course you may go."\r\n\r\n"I did not mean to say anything to hurt you, Mr. Dale."\r\n\r\n"Hurt me! What does it signify whether I am hurt or not? I have no\r\nchildren of my own, and of course my only business in life is to\r\nprovide for my nephews and nieces. I am an old fool if I expect that\r\nthey are to love me in return, and if I venture to express a wish\r\nI am interfering and doing wrong! It is hard,--very hard. I know\r\nwell that they have been brought up to dislike me, and yet I am\r\nendeavouring to do my duty by them."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Dale, that accusation has not been deserved. They have not been\r\nbrought up to dislike you. I believe that they have both loved and\r\nrespected you as their uncle; but such love and respect will not give\r\nyou a right to dispose of their hands."\r\n\r\n"Who wants to dispose of their hands?"\r\n\r\n"There are some things in which I think no uncle,--no parent,--should\r\ninterfere, and of all such things this is the chief. If after that\r\nyou may choose to tell her your wishes, of course you can do so."\r\n\r\n"It will not be much good after you have set her against me."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Dale, you have no right to say such things to me, and you are\r\nvery unjust in doing so. If you think that I have set my girls\r\nagainst you, it will be much better that we should leave Allington\r\naltogether. I have been placed in circumstances which have made it\r\ndifficult for me to do my duty to my children; but I have endeavoured\r\nto do it, not regarding my own personal wishes. I am quite sure,\r\nhowever, that it would be wrong in me to keep them here, if I am to\r\nbe told by you that I have taught them to regard you unfavourably.\r\nIndeed, I cannot suffer such a thing to be said to me."\r\n\r\nAll this Mrs. Dale said with an air of decision, and with a voice\r\nexpressing a sense of injury received, which made the squire feel\r\nthat she was very much in earnest.\r\n\r\n"Is it not true," he said, defending himself, "that in all that\r\nrelates to the girls you have ever regarded me with suspicion?"\r\n\r\n"No, it is not true." And then she corrected herself, feeling\r\nthat there was something of truth in the squire\'s last assertion.\r\n"Certainly not with suspicion," she said. "But as this matter has\r\ngone so far, I will explain what my real feelings have been. In\r\nworldly matters you can do much for my girls, and have done much."\r\n\r\n"And wish to do more," said the squire.\r\n\r\n"I am sure you do. But I cannot on that account give up my place as\r\ntheir only living parent. They are my children, and not yours. And\r\neven could I bring myself to allow you to act as their guardian and\r\nnatural protector, they would not consent to such an arrangement. You\r\ncannot call that suspicion."\r\n\r\n"I can call it jealousy."\r\n\r\n"And should not a mother be jealous of her children\'s love?"\r\n\r\nDuring all this time the squire was walking up and down the room\r\nwith his hands in his trousers pockets. And when Mrs. Dale had last\r\nspoken, he continued his walk for some time in silence.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it is well that you should have spoken out," he said.\r\n\r\n"The manner in which you accused me made it necessary."\r\n\r\n"I did not intend to accuse you, and I do not do so now; but I think\r\nthat you have been, and that you are, very hard to me,--very hard\r\nindeed. I have endeavoured to make your children, and yourself also,\r\nsharers with me in such prosperity as has been mine. I have striven\r\nto add to your comfort and to their happiness. I am most anxious to\r\nsecure their future welfare. You would have been very wrong had you\r\ndeclined to accept this on their behalf; but I think that in return\r\nfor it you need not have begrudged me the affection and obedience\r\nwhich generally follows from such good offices."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Dale, I have begrudged you nothing of this."\r\n\r\n"I am hurt;--I am hurt," he continued. And she was surprised by his\r\nlook of pain even more than by the unaccustomed warmth of his words.\r\n"What you have said has, I have known, been the case all along. But\r\nthough I had felt it to be so, I own that I am hurt by your open\r\nwords."\r\n\r\n"Because I have said that my own children must ever be my own?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, you have said more than that. You and the girls have been living\r\nhere, close to me, for--how many years is it now?--and during all\r\nthose years there has grown up for me no kindly feeling. Do you think\r\nthat I cannot hear, and see, and feel? Do you suppose that I am a\r\nfool and do not know? As for yourself you would never enter this\r\nhouse if you did not feel yourself constrained to do so for the\r\nsake of appearances. I suppose it is all as it should be. Having no\r\nchildren of my own, I owe the duty of a parent to my nieces; but I\r\nhave no right to expect from them in return either love, regard, or\r\nobedience. I know I am keeping you here against your will, Mary. I\r\nwon\'t do so any longer." And he made a sign to her that she was to\r\ndepart.\r\n\r\nAs she rose from her seat her heart was softened towards him. In\r\nthese latter days he had shown much kindness to the girls,--a\r\nkindness that was more akin to the gentleness of love than had\r\never come from him before. Lily\'s fate had seemed to melt even his\r\nsternness, and he had striven to be tender in his words and ways.\r\nAnd now he spoke as though he had loved the girls, and had loved\r\nthem in vain. Doubtless he had been a disagreeable neighbour to his\r\nsister-in-law, making her feel that it was never for her personally\r\nthat he had opened his hand. Doubtless he had been moved by an\r\nunconscious desire to undermine and take upon himself her authority\r\nwith her own children. Doubtless he had looked askance at her from\r\nthe first day of her marriage with his brother. She had been keenly\r\nalive to all this since she had first known him, and more keenly\r\nalive to it than ever since the failure of those efforts she had made\r\nto live with him on terms of affection, made during the first year or\r\ntwo of her residence at the Small House. But, nevertheless, in spite\r\nof all, her heart bled for him now. She had gained her victory over\r\nhim, having fully held her own position with her children; but now\r\nthat he complained that he had been beaten in the struggle, her heart\r\nbled for him.\r\n\r\n"My brother," she said, and as she spoke she offered him her hands,\r\n"it may be that we have not thought as kindly of each other as we\r\nshould have done."\r\n\r\n"I have endeavoured," said the old man. "I have endeavoured--" And\r\nthen he stopped, either hindered by some excess of emotion, or unable\r\nto find the words which were necessary for the expression of his\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n"Let us endeavour once again,--both of us."\r\n\r\n"What, begin again at near seventy! No, Mary, there is no more\r\nbeginning again for me. All this shall make no difference to the\r\ngirls. As long as I am here they shall have the house. If they marry,\r\nI will do for them what I can. I believe Bernard is much in earnest\r\nin his suit, and if Bell will listen to him, she shall still be\r\nwelcomed here as mistress of Allington. What you have said shall make\r\nno difference;--but as to beginning again, it is simply impossible."\r\n\r\nAfter that Mrs. Dale walked home through the garden by herself. He\r\nhad studiously told her that that house in which they lived should be\r\nlent, not to her, but to her children, during his lifetime. He had\r\npositively declined the offer of her warmer regard. He had made her\r\nunderstand that they were to look on each other almost as enemies;\r\nbut that she, enemy as she was, should still be allowed the use of\r\nhis munificence, because he chose to do his duty by his nieces!\r\n\r\n"It will be better for us that we shall leave it," she said to\r\nherself as she seated herself in her own arm-chair over the\r\ndrawing-room fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR CROFTS IS CALLED IN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale had not sat long in her drawing-room before tidings were\r\nbrought to her which for a while drew her mind away from that\r\nquestion of her removal. "Mamma," said Bell, entering the room,\r\n"I really do believe that Jane has got scarlatina." Jane, the\r\nparlour-maid, had been ailing for the last two days, but nothing\r\nserious had hitherto been suspected.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale instantly jumped up. "Who is with her?" she asked.\r\n\r\nIt appeared from Bell\'s answer that both she and Lily had been with\r\nthe girl, and that Lily was still in the room. Whereupon Mrs. Dale\r\nran upstairs, and there was on the sudden a commotion in the house.\r\nIn an hour or so the village doctor was there, and he expressed an\r\nopinion that the girl\'s ailment was certainly scarlatina. Mrs. Dale,\r\nnot satisfied with this, sent off a boy to Guestwick for Dr. Crofts,\r\nhaving herself maintained an opposition of many years\' standing\r\nagainst the medical reputation of the apothecary, and gave a positive\r\norder to the two girls not to visit poor Jane again. She herself had\r\nhad scarlatina, and might do as she pleased. Then, too, a nurse was\r\nhired.\r\n\r\nAll this changed for a few hours the current of Mrs. Dale\'s thoughts:\r\nbut in the evening she went back to the subject of her morning\r\nconversation, and before the three ladies went to bed, they held\r\ntogether an open council of war upon the subject. Dr. Crofts had\r\nbeen found to be away from Guestwick, and word had been sent on his\r\nbehalf that he would be over at Allington early on the following\r\nmorning. Mrs. Dale had almost made up her mind that the malady of\r\nher favourite maid was not scarlatina, but had not on that account\r\nrelaxed her order as to the absence of her daughters from the maid\'s\r\nbedside.\r\n\r\n"Let us go at once," said Bell, who was even more opposed to any\r\ndomination on the part of her uncle than was her mother. In the\r\ndiscussion which had been taking place between them the whole matter\r\nof Bernard\'s courtship had come upon the carpet. Bell had kept her\r\ncousin\'s offer to herself as long as she had been able to do so;\r\nbut since her uncle had pressed the subject upon Mrs. Dale, it was\r\nimpossible for Bell to remain silent any longer. "You do not want\r\nme to marry him, mamma; do you?" she had said, when her mother had\r\nspoken with some show of kindness towards Bernard. In answer to this,\r\nMrs. Dale had protested vehemently that she had no such wish, and\r\nLily, who still held to her belief in Dr. Crofts, was almost equally\r\nanimated. To them all, the idea that their uncle should in any\r\nway interfere in their own views of life, on the strength of the\r\npecuniary assistance which they had received from him, was peculiarly\r\ndistasteful. But it was especially distasteful that he should presume\r\nto have even an opinion as to their disposition in marriage. They\r\ndeclared to each other that their uncle could have no right to object\r\nto any marriage which either of them might contemplate as long as\r\ntheir mother should approve of it. The poor old squire had been right\r\nin saying that he was regarded with suspicion. He was so regarded.\r\nThe fault had certainly been his own, in having endeavoured to win\r\nthe daughters without thinking it worth his while to win the mother.\r\nThe girls had unconsciously felt that the attempt was made, and had\r\nvigorously rebelled against it. It had not been their fault that they\r\nhad been brought to live in their uncle\'s house, and made to ride\r\non his ponies, and to eat partially of his bread. They had so eaten,\r\nand so lived, and declared themselves to be grateful. The squire was\r\ngood in his way, and they recognized his goodness; but not on that\r\naccount would they transfer to him one jot of the allegiance which\r\nas children they owed to their mother. When she told them her tale,\r\nexplaining to them the words which their uncle had spoken that\r\nmorning, they expressed their regret that he should be so grieved;\r\nbut they were strong in assurances to their mother that she had been\r\nsinned against, and was not sinning.\r\n\r\n"Let us go at once," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"It is much easier said than done, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Of course it is, mamma; else we shouldn\'t be here now. What I mean\r\nis this,--let us take some necessary first step at once. It is clear\r\nthat my uncle thinks that our remaining here should give him some\r\nright over us. I do not say that he is wrong to think so. Perhaps it\r\nis natural. Perhaps, in accepting his kindness, we ought to submit\r\nourselves to him. If that be so, it is a conclusive reason for our\r\ngoing."\r\n\r\n"Could we not pay him rent for the house," said Lily, "as Mrs. Hearn\r\ndoes? You would like to remain here, mamma, if you could do that?"\r\n\r\n"But we could not do that, Lily. We must choose for ourselves a\r\nsmaller house than this, and one that is not burdened with the\r\nexpense of a garden. Even if we paid but a moderate rent for this\r\nplace, we should not have the means of living here."\r\n\r\n"Not if we lived on toast and tea?" said Lily, laughing.\r\n\r\n"But I should hardly wish you to live upon toast and tea; and indeed\r\nI fancy that I should get tired of such a diet myself."\r\n\r\n"Never, mamma," said Lily. "As for me, I confess to a longing after\r\nmutton chops; but I don\'t think you would ever want such vulgar\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, it would be impossible to remain here," said Bell.\r\n"Uncle Christopher would not take rent from mamma; and even if he\r\ndid, we should not know how to go on with our other arrangements\r\nafter such a change. No; we must give up the dear old Small House."\r\n\r\n"It is a dear old house," said Lily, thinking, as she spoke, more of\r\nthose late scenes in the garden, when Crosbie had been with them in\r\nthe autumn months, than of any of the former joys of her childhood.\r\n\r\n"After all, I do not know that I should be right to move," said Mrs.\r\nDale, doubtingly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," said both the girls at once. "Of course you will be\r\nright, mamma; there cannot be a doubt about it, mamma. If we can get\r\nany cottage, or even lodgings, that would be better than remaining\r\nhere, now that we know what uncle Christopher thinks of it."\r\n\r\n"It will make him very unhappy," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\nBut even this argument did not in the least move the girls. They were\r\nvery sorry that their uncle should be unhappy. They would endeavour\r\nto show him by some increased show of affection that their feelings\r\ntowards him were not unkind. Should he speak to them they would\r\nendeavour to explain to him that their thoughts towards him were\r\naltogether affectionate. But they could not remain at Allington\r\nincreasing their load of gratitude, seeing that he expected a certain\r\npayment which they did not feel themselves able to render.\r\n\r\n"We should be robbing him, if we stayed here," Bell\r\ndeclared;--"wilfully robbing him of what he believes to be his just\r\nshare of the bargain."\r\n\r\nSo it was settled among them that notice should be given to their\r\nuncle of their intention to quit the Small House of Allington.\r\n\r\nAnd then came the question as to their new home. Mrs. Dale was aware\r\nthat her income was at any rate better than that possessed by Mrs.\r\nEames, and therefore she had fair ground for presuming that she could\r\nafford to keep a house at Guestwick. "If we do go away, that is what\r\nwe must do," she said.\r\n\r\n"And we shall have to walk out with Mary Eames, instead of Susan\r\nBoyce," said Lily. "It won\'t make so much difference after all."\r\n\r\n"In that respect we shall gain as much as we lose," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"And then it will be so nice to have the shops," said Lily,\r\nironically.\r\n\r\n"Only we shall never have any money to buy anything," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"But we shall see more of the world," said Lily. "Lady Julia\'s\r\ncarriage comes into town twice a week, and the Miss Gruffens drive\r\nabout in great style. Upon the whole, we shall gain a great deal;\r\nonly for the poor old garden. Mamma, I do think I shall break my\r\nheart at parting with Hopkins; and as to him, I shall be disappointed\r\nin mankind if he ever holds his head up again after I am gone."\r\n\r\nBut in truth there was very much of sadness in their resolution, and\r\nto Mrs. Dale it seemed as though she were managing matters badly\r\nfor her daughters, and allowing poverty and misfortune to come upon\r\nthem through her own fault. She well knew how great a load of sorrow\r\nwas lying on Lily\'s heart, hidden beneath those little attempts at\r\npleasantry which she made. When she spoke of being disappointed in\r\nmankind, Mrs. Dale could hardly repress an outward shudder that would\r\nbetray her thoughts. And now she was consenting to take them forth\r\nfrom their comfortable home, from the luxury of their lawns and\r\ngardens, and to bring them to some small dingy corner of a provincial\r\ntown,--because she had failed to make herself happy with her\r\nbrother-in-law. Could she be right to give up all the advantages\r\nwhich they enjoyed at Allington,--advantages which had come to them\r\nfrom so legitimate a source,--because her own feelings had been\r\nwounded? In all their future want of comfort, in the comfortless\r\ndowdiness of the new home to which she would remove them, would\r\nshe not always blame herself for having brought them to that by\r\nher own false pride? And yet it seemed to her that she now had no\r\nalternative. She could not now teach her daughters to obey their\r\nuncle\'s wishes in all things. She could not make Bell understand that\r\nit would be well that she should marry Bernard because the squire had\r\nset his heart on such a marriage. She had gone so far that she could\r\nnot now go back.\r\n\r\n"I suppose we must move at Lady-day?" said Bell, who was in favour of\r\ninstant action. "If so, had you not better let uncle Christopher know\r\nat once?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think that we can find a house by that time."\r\n\r\n"We can get in somewhere," continued Bell. "There are plenty of\r\nlodgings in Guestwick, you know." But the sound of the word lodgings\r\nwas uncomfortable in Mrs. Dale\'s ears.\r\n\r\n"If we are to go, let us go at once," said Lily. "We need not stand\r\nmuch upon the order of our going."\r\n\r\n"Your uncle will be very much shocked," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"He cannot say that it is your fault," said Bell.\r\n\r\nIt was thus agreed between them that the necessary information should\r\nbe at once given to the squire, and that the old, well-loved house\r\nshould be left for ever. It would be a great fall in a worldly\r\npoint of view,--from the Allington Small House to an abode in some\r\nlittle street of Guestwick. At Allington they had been county\r\npeople,--raised to a level with their own squire and other squires by\r\nthe circumstance of their residence; but at Guestwick they would be\r\nsmall even among the people of the town. They would be on an equality\r\nwith the Eameses, and much looked down upon by the Gruffens. They\r\nwould hardly dare to call any more at Guestwick Manor, seeing that\r\nthey certainly could not expect Lady Julia to call upon them at\r\nGuestwick. Mrs. Boyce no doubt would patronize them, and they could\r\nalready anticipate the condolence which would be offered to them by\r\nMrs. Hearn. Indeed such a movement on their part would be tantamount\r\nto a confession of failure in the full hearing of so much of the\r\nworld as was known to them.\r\n\r\nI must not allow my readers to suppose that these considerations were\r\na matter of indifference to any of the ladies at the Small House. To\r\nsome women of strong mind, of highly-strung philosophic tendencies,\r\nsuch considerations might have been indifferent. But Mrs. Dale was\r\nnot of this nature, nor were her daughters. The good things of the\r\nworld were good in their eyes, and they valued the privilege of\r\na pleasant social footing among their friends. They were by no\r\nmeans capable of a wise contempt of the advantages which chance had\r\nhitherto given to them. They could not go forth rejoicing in the\r\ncomparative poverty of their altered condition. But then, neither\r\ncould they purchase those luxuries which they were about to abandon\r\nat the price which was asked for them.\r\n\r\n"Had you not better write to my uncle?" said one of the girls. But\r\nto this Mrs. Dale objected that she could not make a letter on such\r\na subject clearly intelligible, and that therefore she would see the\r\nsquire on the following morning. "It will be very dreadful," she\r\nsaid, "but it will soon be over. It is not what he will say at the\r\nmoment that I fear so much, as the bitter reproaches of his face when\r\nI shall meet him afterwards." So, on the following morning, she again\r\nmade her way, and now without invitation, to the squire\'s study.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Dale," she began, starting upon her work with some confusion in\r\nher manner, and hurry in her speech, "I have been thinking over what\r\nwe were saying together yesterday, and I have come to a resolution\r\nwhich I know I ought to make known to you without a moment\'s delay."\r\n\r\nThe squire also had thought of what had passed between them, and had\r\nsuffered much as he had done so; but he had thought of it without\r\nacerbity or anger. His thoughts were ever gentler than his words, and\r\nhis heart softer than any exponent of his heart that he was able to\r\nput forth. He wished to love his brother\'s children, and to be loved\r\nby them; but even failing that, he wished to do good to them. It had\r\nnot occurred to him to be angry with Mrs. Dale after that interview\r\nwas over. The conversation had not gone pleasantly with him; but\r\nthen he hardly expected that things would go pleasantly. No idea had\r\noccurred to him that evil could come upon any of the Dale ladies from\r\nthe words which had then been spoken. He regarded the Small House as\r\ntheir abode and home as surely as the Great House was his own. In\r\ngiving him his due, it must be declared that any allusion to their\r\nholding these as a benefit done to them by him had been very far\r\nfrom his thoughts. Mrs. Hearn, who held her cottage at half its real\r\nvalue, grumbled almost daily at him as her landlord; but it never\r\noccurred to him that therefore he should raise her rent, or that in\r\nnot doing so he was acting with special munificence. It had ever been\r\nto him a grumbling, cross-grained, unpleasant world; and he did not\r\nexpect from Mrs. Hearn, or from his sister-in-law, anything better\r\nthan that to which he had ever been used.\r\n\r\n"It will make me very happy," said he, "if it has any bearing on\r\nBell\'s marriage with her cousin."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Dale, that is out of the question. I would not vex you by saying\r\nso if I were not certain of it; but I know my child so well!"\r\n\r\n"Then we must leave it to time, Mary."\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course; but no time will suffice to make Bell change her\r\nmind. We will, however, leave the subject. And now, Mr. Dale, I have\r\nto tell you of something else;--we have resolved to leave the Small\r\nHouse."\r\n\r\n"Resolved on what?" said the squire, turning his eyes full upon her.\r\n\r\n"We have resolved to leave the Small House."\r\n\r\n"Leave the Small House!" he said, repeating her words; "and where on\r\nearth do you mean to go?"\r\n\r\n"We think we shall go into Guestwick."\r\n\r\n"And why?"\r\n\r\n"Ah, that is so hard to explain. If you would only accept the fact as\r\nI tell it to you, and not ask for the reasons which have guided me!"\r\n\r\n"But that is out of the question, Mary. In such a matter as that I\r\nmust ask your reasons; and I must tell you also that, in my opinion,\r\nyou will not be doing your duty to your daughters in carrying out\r\nsuch an intention, unless your reasons are very strong indeed."\r\n\r\n"But they are very strong," said Mrs. Dale; and then she paused.\r\n\r\n"I cannot understand it," said the squire. "I cannot bring myself\r\nto believe that you are really in earnest. Are you not comfortable\r\nthere?"\r\n\r\n"More comfortable than we have any right to be with our means."\r\n\r\n"But I thought you always did very nicely with your money. You never\r\nget into debt."\r\n\r\n"No; I never get into debt. It is not that, exactly. The fact is,\r\nMr. Dale, we have no right to live there without paying rent; but we\r\ncould not afford to live there if we did pay rent."\r\n\r\n"Who has talked about rent?" he said, jumping up from his chair.\r\n"Some one has been speaking falsehoods of me behind my back." No\r\ngleam of the real truth had yet come to him. No idea had reached his\r\nmind that his relatives thought it necessary to leave his house in\r\nconsequence of any word that he himself had spoken. He had never\r\nconsidered himself to have been in any special way generous to them,\r\nand would not have thought it reasonable that they should abandon the\r\nhouse in which they had been living, even if his anger against them\r\nhad been strong and hot. "Mary," he said, "I must insist upon getting\r\nto the bottom of this. As for your leaving the house, it is out of\r\nthe question. Where can you be better off, or so well? As to going\r\ninto Guestwick, what sort of life would there be for the girls? I\r\nput all that aside as out of the question; but I must know what has\r\ninduced you to make such a proposition. Tell me honestly,--has any\r\none spoken evil of me behind my back?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale had been prepared for opposition and for reproach; but\r\nthere was a decision about the squire\'s words, and an air of\r\nmasterdom in his manner, which made her recognize more fully than she\r\nhad yet done the difficulty of her position. She almost began to fear\r\nthat she would lack power to carry out her purpose.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, it is not so, Mr. Dale."\r\n\r\n"Then what is it?"\r\n\r\n"I know that if I attempt to tell you, you will be vexed, and will\r\ncontradict me."\r\n\r\n"Vexed I shall be, probably."\r\n\r\n"And yet I cannot help it. Indeed, I am endeavouring to do what is\r\nright by you and by the children."\r\n\r\n"Never mind me; your duty is to think of them."\r\n\r\n"Of course it is; and in doing this they most cordially agree with\r\nme."\r\n\r\nIn using such argument as that, Mrs. Dale showed her weakness, and\r\nthe squire was not slow to take advantage of it. "Your duty is to\r\nthem," he said; "but I do not mean by that that your duty is to let\r\nthem act in any way that may best please them for the moment. I\r\ncan understand that they should be run away with by some romantic\r\nnonsense, but I cannot understand it of you."\r\n\r\n"The truth is this, Mr. Dale. You think that my children owe to you\r\nthat sort of obedience which is due to a parent, and as long as they\r\nremain here, accepting from your hands so large a part of their daily\r\nsupport, it is perhaps natural that you should think so. In this\r\nunhappy affair about Bell--"\r\n\r\n"I have never said anything of the kind," said the squire,\r\ninterrupting her.\r\n\r\n"No; you have not said so. And I do not wish you to think that I\r\nmake any complaint. But I feel that it is so, and they feel it. And,\r\ntherefore, we have made up our minds to go away."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale, as she finished, was aware that she had not told her story\r\nwell, but she had acknowledged to herself that it was quite out of\r\nher power to tell it as it should be told. Her main object was to\r\nmake her brother-in-law understand that she certainly would leave his\r\nhouse, and to make him understand this with as little pain to himself\r\nas possible. She did not in the least mind his thinking her foolish,\r\nif only she could so carry her point as to be able to tell her\r\ndaughters on her return that the matter was settled. But the squire,\r\nfrom his words and manners, seemed indisposed to give her this\r\nprivilege.\r\n\r\n"Of all the propositions which I ever heard," said he, "it is the\r\nmost unreasonable. It amounts to this, that you are too proud to live\r\nrent-free in a house which belongs to your husband\'s brother, and\r\ntherefore you intend to subject yourself and your children to the\r\ngreat discomfort of a very straitened income. If you yourself only\r\nwere concerned I should have no right to say anything; but I think\r\nmyself bound to tell you that, as regards the girls, everybody that\r\nknows you will think you to have been very wrong. It is in the\r\nnatural course of things that they should live in that house. The\r\nplace has never been let. As far as I know, no rent has ever been\r\npaid for the house since it was built. It has always been given to\r\nsome member of the family, who has been considered as having the best\r\nright to it. I have considered your footing there as firm as my own\r\nhere. A quarrel between me and your children would be to me a great\r\ncalamity, though, perhaps, they might be indifferent to it. But if\r\nthere were such a quarrel it would afford no reason for their leaving\r\nthat house. Let me beg you to think over the matter again."\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: "Let me beg you to think over the matter again."]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe squire could assume an air of authority on certain occasions, and\r\nhe had done so now. Mrs. Dale found that she could only answer him\r\nby a simple repetition of her own intention; and, indeed, failed in\r\nmaking him any serviceable answer whatsoever.\r\n\r\n"I know that you are very good to my girls," she said.\r\n\r\n"I will say nothing about that," he answered; not thinking at that\r\nmoment of the Small House, but of the full possession which he had\r\ndesired to give to the elder of all the privileges which should\r\nbelong to the mistress of Allington,--thinking also of the means by\r\nwhich he was hoping to repair poor Lily\'s shattered fortunes. What\r\nwords were further said had no great significance, and Mrs. Dale got\r\nherself away, feeling that she had failed. As soon as she was gone\r\nthe squire arose, and putting on his great-coat, went forth with his\r\nhat and stick to the front of the house. He went out in order that\r\nhis thoughts might be more free, and that he might indulge in that\r\nsolace which an injured man finds in contemplating his injury. He\r\ndeclared to himself that he was very hardly used,--so hardly used,\r\nthat he almost began to doubt himself and his own motives. Why was\r\nit that the people around him disliked him so strongly,--avoided him\r\nand thwarted him in the efforts which he made for their welfare? He\r\noffered to his nephew all the privileges of a son,--much more indeed\r\nthan the privileges of a son,--merely asking in return that he would\r\nconsent to live permanently in the house which was to be his own. But\r\nhis nephew refused. "He cannot bear to live with me," said the old\r\nman to himself sorely. He was prepared to treat his nieces with more\r\ngenerosity than the daughters of the House of Allington had usually\r\nreceived from their fathers; and they repelled his kindness, running\r\naway from him, and telling him openly that they would not be beholden\r\nto him. He walked slowly up and down the terrace, thinking of this\r\nvery bitterly. He did not find in the contemplation of his grievance\r\nall that solace which a grievance usually gives, because he accused\r\nhimself in his thoughts rather than others. He declared to himself\r\nthat he was made to be hated, and protested to himself that it would\r\nbe well that he should die and be buried out of memory, so that\r\nthe remaining Dales might have a better chance of living happily;\r\nand then as he thus discussed all this within his own bosom, his\r\nthoughts were very tender, and though he was aggrieved, he was most\r\naffectionate to those who had most injured him. But it was absolutely\r\nbeyond his power to reproduce outwardly, with words and outward\r\nsigns, such thoughts and feelings.\r\n\r\nIt was now very nearly the end of the year, but the weather was still\r\nsoft and open. The air was damp rather than cold, and the lawns\r\nand fields still retained the green tints of new vegetation. As\r\nthe squire was walking on the terrace Hopkins came up to him, and\r\ntouching his hat, remarked that they should have frost in a day or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\n"I suppose we shall," said the squire.\r\n\r\n"We must have the mason to the flues of that little grape-house, sir,\r\nbefore I can do any good with a fire there."\r\n\r\n"Which grape-house?" said the squire, crossly.\r\n\r\n"Why, the grape-house in the other garden, sir. It ought to have been\r\ndone last year by rights." This Hopkins said to punish his master\r\nfor being cross to him. On that matter of the flues of Mrs. Dale\'s\r\ngrape-house he had, with much consideration, spared his master during\r\nthe last winter, and he felt that this ought to be remembered now. "I\r\ncan\'t put any fire in it, not to do any real good, till something\'s\r\ndone. That\'s sure."\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t put any fire in it," said the squire.\r\n\r\nNow the grapes in question were supposed to be peculiarly fine, and\r\nwere the glory of the garden of the Small House. They were always\r\nforced, though not forced so early as those at the Great House, and\r\nHopkins was in a state of great confusion.\r\n\r\n"They\'ll never ripen, sir; not the whole year through."\r\n\r\n"Then let them be unripe," said the squire, walking about.\r\n\r\nHopkins did not at all understand it. The squire in his natural\r\ncourse was very unwilling to neglect any such matter as this, but\r\nwould be specially unwilling to neglect anything touching the\r\nSmall House. So Hopkins stood on the terrace, raising his hat and\r\nscratching his head. "There\'s something wrong amongst them," said he\r\nto himself, sorrowfully.\r\n\r\nBut when the squire had walked to the end of the terrace and had\r\nturned upon the path which led round the side of the house, he\r\nstopped and called to Hopkins.\r\n\r\n"Have what is needful done to the flue," he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; very well, sir. It\'ll only be re-setting the bricks.\r\nNothing more ain\'t needful, just this winter."\r\n\r\n"Have the place put in perfect order while you\'re about it," said the\r\nsquire, and then he walked away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nDR. CROFTS IS TURNED OUT.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Have you heard the news, my dear, from the Small House?" said Mrs.\r\nBoyce to her husband, some two or three days after Mrs. Dale\'s visit\r\nto the squire. It was one o\'clock, and the parish pastor had come in\r\nfrom his ministrations to dine with his wife and children.\r\n\r\n"What news?" said Mr. Boyce, for he had heard none.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Dale and the girls are going to leave the Small House; they\'re\r\ngoing into Guestwick to live."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Dale going away; nonsense!" said the vicar. "What on earth\r\nshould take her into Guestwick? She doesn\'t pay a shilling of rent\r\nwhere she is."\r\n\r\n"I can assure you it\'s true, my dear. I was with Mrs. Hearn just now,\r\nand she had it direct from Mrs. Dale\'s own lips. Mrs. Hearn said\r\nshe\'d never been taken so much aback in her whole life. There\'s been\r\nsome quarrel, you may be sure of that."\r\n\r\nMr. Boyce sat silent, pulling off his dirty shoes preparatory to his\r\ndinner. Tidings so important, as touching the social life of his\r\nparish, had not come to him for many a day, and he could hardly bring\r\nhimself to credit them at so short a notice.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Hearn says that Mrs. Dale spoke ever so firmly about it, as\r\nthough determined that nothing should change her."\r\n\r\n"And did she say why?"\r\n\r\n"Well, not exactly. But Mrs. Hearn said she could understand there\r\nhad been words between her and the squire. It couldn\'t be anything\r\nelse, you know. Probably it had something to do with that man\r\nCrosbie."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll be very pushed about money," said Mr. Boyce, thrusting his\r\nfeet into his slippers.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I said to Mrs. Hearn. And those girls have never\r\nbeen used to anything like real economy. What\'s to become of them I\r\ndon\'t know;" and Mrs. Boyce, as she expressed her sympathy for her\r\ndear friends, received considerable comfort from the prospect of\r\ntheir future poverty. It always is so, and Mrs. Boyce was not worse\r\nthan her neighbours.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find they\'ll make it up before the time comes," said Mr.\r\nBoyce, to whom the excitement of such a change in affairs was almost\r\ntoo good to be true.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid not," said Mrs. Boyce; "I\'m afraid not. They are both so\r\ndetermined. I always thought that riding and giving the girls hats\r\nand habits was injurious. It was treating them as though they were\r\nthe squire\'s daughters, and they were not the squire\'s daughters."\r\n\r\n"It was almost the same thing."\r\n\r\n"But now we see the difference," said the judicious Mrs. Boyce. "I\r\noften said that dear Mrs. Dale was wrong, and it turns out that I was\r\nright. It will make no difference to me, as regards calling on them\r\nand that sort of thing."\r\n\r\n"Of course it won\'t."\r\n\r\n"Not but what there must be a difference, and a very great difference\r\ntoo. It will be a terrible come down for poor Lily, with the loss of\r\nher fine husband and all."\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, when Mr. Boyce had again gone forth upon his labours,\r\nthe same subject was discussed between Mrs. Boyce and her daughters,\r\nand the mother was very careful to teach her children that Mrs. Dale\r\nwould be just as good a person as ever she had been, and quite as\r\nmuch a lady, even though she should live in a very dingy house at\r\nGuestwick; from which lesson the Boyce girls learned plainly that\r\nMrs. Dale, with Bell and Lily, were about to have a fall in the\r\nworld, and that they were to be treated accordingly.\r\n\r\nFrom all this, it will be discovered that Mrs. Dale had not given\r\nway to the squire\'s arguments, although she had found herself unable\r\nto answer them. As she had returned home she had felt herself to be\r\nalmost vanquished, and had spoken to the girls with the air and tone\r\nof a woman who hardly knew in which course lay the line of her duty.\r\nBut they had not seen the squire\'s manner on the occasion, nor heard\r\nhis words, and they could not understand that their own purpose\r\nshould be abandoned because he did not like it. So they talked their\r\nmother into fresh resolves, and on the following morning she wrote a\r\nnote to her brother-in-law, assuring him that she had thought much of\r\nall that he had said, but again declaring that she regarded herself\r\nas bound in duty to leave the Small House. To this he had returned\r\nno answer, and she had communicated her intention to Mrs. Hearn,\r\nthinking it better that there should be no secret in the matter.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry to hear that your sister-in-law is going to leave us,"\r\nMr. Boyce said to the squire that same afternoon.\r\n\r\n"Who told you that?" asked the squire, showing by his tone that he by\r\nno means liked the topic of conversation which the parson had chosen.\r\n\r\n"Well, I had it from Mrs. Boyce, and I think Mrs. Hearn told her."\r\n\r\n"I wish Mrs. Hearn would mind her own business, and not spread idle\r\nreports."\r\n\r\nThe squire said nothing more, and Mr. Boyce felt that he had been\r\nvery unjustly snubbed.\r\n\r\nDr. Crofts had come over and pronounced as a fact that it was\r\nscarlatina. Village apothecaries are generally wronged by the doubts\r\nwhich are thrown upon them, for the town doctors when they come\r\nalways confirm what the village apothecaries have said.\r\n\r\n"There can be no doubt as to its being scarlatina," the doctor\r\ndeclared; "but the symptoms are all favourable."\r\n\r\nThere was, however, much worse coming than this. Two days afterwards\r\nLily found herself to be rather unwell. She endeavoured to keep it to\r\nherself, fearing that she should be brought under the doctor\'s notice\r\nas a patient; but her efforts were unavailing, and on the following\r\nmorning it was known that she had also taken the disease. Dr. Crofts\r\ndeclared that everything was in her favour. The weather was cold.\r\nThe presence of the malady in the house had caused them all to be\r\ncareful, and, moreover, good advice was at hand at once. The doctor\r\nbegged Mrs. Dale not to be uneasy, but he was very eager in begging\r\nthat the two sisters might not be allowed to be together. "Could\r\nyou not send Bell into Guestwick,--to Mrs. Eames\'s?" said he. But\r\nBell did not choose to be sent to Mrs. Eames\'s, and was with great\r\ndifficulty kept out of her mother\'s bedroom, to which Lily as an\r\ninvalid was transferred.\r\n\r\n"If you will allow me to say so," he said to Bell, on the second day\r\nafter Lily\'s complaint had declared itself, "you are wrong to stay\r\nhere in the house."\r\n\r\n"I certainly shall not leave mamma, when she has got so much upon her\r\nhands," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"But if you should be taken ill she would have more on her hands,"\r\npleaded the doctor.\r\n\r\n"I could not do it," Bell replied. "If I were taken over to\r\nGuestwick, I should be so uneasy that I should walk back to Allington\r\nthe first moment that I could escape from the house."\r\n\r\n"I think your mother would be more comfortable without you."\r\n\r\n"And I think she would be more comfortable with me. I don\'t ever like\r\nto hear of a woman running away from illness; but when a sister or\r\na daughter does so, it is intolerable." So Bell remained, without\r\npermission indeed to see her sister, but performing various outside\r\nadministrations which were much needed.\r\n\r\nAnd thus all manner of trouble came upon the inhabitants of the Small\r\nHouse, falling upon them as it were in a heap together. It was as yet\r\nbarely two months since those terrible tidings had come respecting\r\nCrosbie; tidings which, it was felt at the time, would of themselves\r\nbe sufficient to crush them; and now to that misfortune other\r\nmisfortunes had been added,--one quick upon the heels of another. In\r\nthe teeth of the doctor\'s kind prophecy Lily became very ill, and\r\nafter a few days was delirious. She would talk to her mother about\r\nCrosbie, speaking of him as she used to speak in the autumn that was\r\npassed. But even in her madness she remembered that they had resolved\r\nto leave their present home; and she asked the doctor twice whether\r\ntheir lodgings in Guestwick were ready for them.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that Crofts first heard of their intention. Now, in\r\nthese days of Lily\'s worst illness, he came daily over to Allington,\r\nremaining there, on one occasion, the whole night. For all this he\r\nwould take no fee;--nor had he ever taken a fee from Mrs. Dale. "I\r\nwish you would not come so often," Bell said to him one evening, as\r\nhe stood with her at the drawing-room fire, after he had left the\r\npatient\'s room; "you are overloading us with obligations." On that\r\nday Lily was over the worst of the fever, and he had been able to\r\ntell Mrs. Dale that he did not think that she was now in danger.\r\n\r\n"It will not be necessary much longer," he said; "the worst of it is\r\nover."\r\n\r\n"It is such a luxury to hear you say so. I suppose we shall owe her\r\nlife to you; but nevertheless--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; scarlatina is not such a terrible thing now as it used to\r\nbe."\r\n\r\n"Then why should you have devoted your time to her as you have done?\r\nIt frightens me when I think of the injury we must have done you."\r\n\r\n"My horse has felt it more than I have," said the doctor, laughing.\r\n"My patients at Guestwick are not so very numerous." Then, instead of\r\ngoing, he sat himself down. "And it is really true," he said, "that\r\nyou are all going to leave this house?"\r\n\r\n"Quite true. We shall do so at the end of March, if Lily is well\r\nenough to be moved."\r\n\r\n"Lily will be well long before that, I hope; not, indeed, that she\r\nought to be moved out of her own rooms for many weeks to come yet."\r\n\r\n"Unless we are stopped by her we shall certainly go at the end of\r\nMarch." Bell now had also sat down, and they both remained for some\r\ntime looking at the fire in silence.\r\n\r\n"And why is it, Bell?" he said, at last. "But I don\'t know whether I\r\nhave a right to ask."\r\n\r\n"You have a right to ask any question about us," she said. "My uncle\r\nis very kind. He is more than kind; he is generous. But he seems to\r\nthink that our living here gives him a right to interfere with mamma.\r\nWe don\'t like that, and, therefore, we are going."\r\n\r\nThe doctor still sat on one side of the fire, and Bell still sat\r\nopposite to him; but the conversation did not form itself very freely\r\nbetween them. "It is bad news," he said, at last.\r\n\r\n"At any rate, when we are ill you will not have so far to come and\r\nsee us."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I understand. That means that I am ungracious not to\r\ncongratulate myself on having you all so much nearer to me; but I do\r\nnot in the least. I cannot bear to think of you as living anywhere\r\nbut here at Allington. Dales will be out of their place in a street\r\nat Guestwick."\r\n\r\n"That\'s hard upon the Dales, too."\r\n\r\n"It is hard upon them. It\'s a sort of offshoot from that very\r\ntyrannical law of noblesse oblige. I don\'t think you ought to go away\r\nfrom Allington, unless the circumstances are very imperative."\r\n\r\n"But they are very imperative."\r\n\r\n"In that case, indeed!" And then again he fell into silence.\r\n\r\n"Have you never seen that mamma is not happy here?" she said, after\r\nanother pause. "For myself, I never quite understood it all before as\r\nI do now; but now I see it."\r\n\r\n"And I have seen it;--have seen at least what you mean. She has led\r\na life of restraint; but then, how frequently is such restraint the\r\nnecessity of a life? I hardly think that your mother would move on\r\nthat account."\r\n\r\n"No. It is on our account. But this restraint, as you call it, makes\r\nus unhappy, and she is governed by seeing that. My uncle is generous\r\nto her as regards money; but in other things,--in matters of\r\nfeeling,--I think he has been ungenerous."\r\n\r\n"Bell," said the doctor; and then he paused.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him, but made no answer. He had always called her\r\nby her Christian name, and they two had ever regarded each other\r\nas close friends. At the present moment she had forgotten all else\r\nbesides this, and yet she had infinite pleasure in sitting there and\r\ntalking to him.\r\n\r\n"I am going to ask you a question which perhaps I ought not to ask,\r\nonly that I have known you so long that I almost feel that I am\r\nspeaking to a sister."\r\n\r\n"You may ask me what you please," said she.\r\n\r\n"It is about your cousin Bernard."\r\n\r\n"About Bernard!" said Bell.\r\n\r\nIt was now dusk; and as they were sitting without other light than\r\nthat of the fire, she knew that he could not discern the colour which\r\ncovered her face as her cousin\'s name was mentioned. But, had the\r\nlight of day pervaded the whole room, I doubt whether Crofts would\r\nhave seen that blush, for he kept his eyes firmly fixed upon the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n"Yes, about Bernard. I don\'t know whether I ought to ask you."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I can\'t say," said Bell, speaking words of the nature of\r\nwhich she was not conscious.\r\n\r\n"There has been a rumour in Guestwick that he and you--"\r\n\r\n"It is untrue," said Bell; "quite untrue. If you hear it repeated,\r\nyou should contradict it. I wonder why people should say such\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n"It would have been an excellent marriage;--all your friends must\r\nhave approved it."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, Dr. Crofts? How I do hate those words, \'an\r\nexcellent marriage.\' In them is contained more of wicked worldliness\r\nthan any other words that one ever hears spoken. You want me to marry\r\nmy cousin simply because I should have a great house to live in, and\r\na coach. I know that you are my friend; but I hate such friendship as\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"I think you misunderstand me, Bell. I mean that it would have been\r\nan excellent marriage, provided you had both loved each other."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t misunderstand you. Of course it would be an excellent\r\nmarriage, if we loved each other. You might say the same if I loved\r\nthe butcher or the baker. What you mean is, that it makes a reason\r\nfor loving him."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I did mean that."\r\n\r\n"Then you mean nothing."\r\n\r\nAfter that, there were again some minutes of silence during which\r\nDr. Crofts got up to go away. "You have scolded me very dreadfully,"\r\nhe said, with a slight smile, "and I believe I have deserved it for\r\ninterfering--"\r\n\r\n"No; not at all for interfering."\r\n\r\n"But at any rate you must forgive me before I go."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t forgive you at all, unless you repent of your sins, and\r\nalter altogether the wickedness of your mind. You will become very\r\nsoon as bad as Dr. Gruffen."\r\n\r\n"Shall I?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I will forgive you; for after all, you are the most generous\r\nman in the world."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; of course I am. Well,--good-by."\r\n\r\n"But, Dr. Crofts, you should not suppose others to be so much more\r\nworldly than yourself. You do not care for money so very much--"\r\n\r\n"But I do care very much."\r\n\r\n"If you did, you would not come here for nothing day after day."\r\n\r\n"I do care for money very much. I have sometimes nearly broken my\r\nheart because I could not get opportunities of earning it. It is the\r\nbest friend that a man can have--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Dr. Crofts!"\r\n\r\n"--the best friend that a man can have, if it be honestly come by.\r\nA woman can hardly realize the sorrow which may fall upon a man from\r\nthe want of such a friend."\r\n\r\n"Of course a man likes to earn a decent living by his profession; and\r\nyou can do that."\r\n\r\n"That depends upon one\'s ideas of decency."\r\n\r\n"Ah! mine never ran very high. I\'ve always had a sort of aptitude for\r\nliving in a pigsty;--a clean pigsty, you know, with nice fresh bean\r\nstraw to lie upon. I think it was a mistake when they made a lady of\r\nme. I do, indeed."\r\n\r\n"I do not," said Dr. Crofts.\r\n\r\n"That\'s because you don\'t quite know me yet. I\'ve not the slightest\r\npleasure in putting on three different dresses a day. I do it very\r\noften because it comes to me to do it, from the way in which we have\r\nbeen taught to live. But when we get to Guestwick I mean to change\r\nall that; and if you come in to tea, you\'ll see me in the same brown\r\nfrock that I wear in the morning,--unless, indeed, the morning\r\nwork makes the brown frock dirty. Oh, Dr. Crofts! you\'ll have it\r\npitch-dark riding home under the Guestwick elms."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind the dark," he said; and it seemed as though he hardly\r\nintended to go even yet.\r\n\r\n"But I do," said Bell, "and I shall ring for candles." But he stopped\r\nher as she put her hand out to the bell-pull.\r\n\r\n"Stop a moment, Bell. You need hardly have the candles before I go,\r\nand you need not begrudge my staying either, seeing that I shall be\r\nall alone at home."\r\n\r\n"Begrudge your staying!"\r\n\r\n"But, however, you shall begrudge it, or else make me very welcome."\r\nHe still held her by the wrist, which he had caught as he prevented\r\nher from summoning the servant.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" said she. "You know you are welcome to us as\r\nflowers in May. You always were welcome; but now, when you have come\r\nto us in our trouble-- At any rate, you shall never say that I turn\r\nyou out."\r\n\r\n"Shall I never say so?" And still he held her by the wrist. He had\r\nkept his chair throughout, but she was standing before him,--between\r\nhim and the fire. But she, though he held her in this way, thought\r\nlittle of his words, or of his action. They had known each other with\r\ngreat intimacy, and though Lily would still laugh at her, saying that\r\nDr. Crofts was her lover, she had long since taught herself that no\r\nsuch feeling as that would ever exist between them.\r\n\r\n"Shall I never say so, Bell? What if so poor a man as I ask for the\r\nhand that you will not give to so rich a man as your cousin Bernard?"\r\n\r\nShe instantly withdrew her arm and moved back very quickly a step or\r\ntwo across the rug. She did it almost with the motion which she might\r\nhave used had he insulted her; or had a man spoken such words who\r\nwould not, under any circumstances, have a right to speak them.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes! I thought it would be so," he said. "I may go now, and may\r\nknow that I have been turned out."\r\n\r\n"What is it you mean, Dr. Crofts? What is it you are saying? Why do\r\nyou talk that nonsense, trying to see if you can provoke me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; it is nonsense. I have no right to address you in that way, and\r\ncertainly should not have done it now that I am in your house in the\r\nway of my profession. I beg your pardon." Now he also was standing,\r\nbut he had not moved from his side of the fireplace. "Are you going\r\nto forgive me before I go?"\r\n\r\n"Forgive you for what?" said she.\r\n\r\n"For daring to love you; for having loved you almost as long as you\r\ncan remember; for loving you better than all beside. This alone you\r\nshould forgive; but will you forgive me for having told it?"\r\n\r\nHe had made her no offer, nor did she expect that he was about to\r\nmake one. She herself had hardly yet realized the meaning of his\r\nwords, and she certainly had asked herself no question as to the\r\nanswer which she should give to them. There are cases in which lovers\r\npresent themselves in so unmistakeable a guise, that the first word\r\nof open love uttered by them tells their whole story, and tells it\r\nwithout the possibility of a surprise. And it is generally so when\r\nthe lover has not been an old friend, when even his acquaintance\r\nhas been of modern date. It had been so essentially in the case of\r\nCrosbie and Lily Dale. When Crosbie came to Lily and made his offer,\r\nhe did it with perfect ease and thorough self-possession, for he\r\nalmost knew that it was expected. And Lily, though she had been\r\nflurried for a moment, had her answer pat enough. She already loved\r\nthe man with all her heart, delighted in his presence, basked in\r\nthe sunshine of his manliness, rejoiced in his wit, and had tuned\r\nher ears to the tone of his voice. It had all been done, and the\r\nworld expected it. Had he not made his offer, Lily would have been\r\nill-treated;--though, alas, alas, there was future ill-treatment, so\r\nmuch heavier, in store for her! But there are other cases in which\r\na lover cannot make himself known as such without great difficulty,\r\nand when he does do so, cannot hope for an immediate answer in his\r\nfavour. It is hard upon old friends that this difficulty should\r\nusually fall the heaviest upon them. Crofts had been so intimate with\r\nthe Dale family that very many persons had thought it probable that\r\nhe would marry one of the girls. Mrs. Dale herself had thought so,\r\nand had almost hoped it. Lily had certainly done both. These thoughts\r\nand hopes had somewhat faded away, but yet their former existence\r\nshould have been in the doctor\'s favour. But now, when he had in some\r\nway spoken out, Bell started back from him and would not believe that\r\nhe was in earnest. She probably loved him better than any man in the\r\nworld, and yet, when he spoke to her of love, she could not bring\r\nherself to understand him.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean, Dr. Crofts; indeed I do not," she said.\r\n\r\n"I had meant to ask you to be my wife; simply that. But you shall not\r\nhave the pain of making me a positive refusal. As I rode here to-day\r\nI thought of it. During my frequent rides of late I have thought of\r\nlittle else. But I told myself that I had no right to do it. I have\r\nnot even a house in which it would be fit that you should live."\r\n\r\n"Dr. Crofts, if I loved you,--if I wished to marry you--" and then\r\nshe stopped herself.\r\n\r\n"But you do not?"\r\n\r\n"No; I think not. I suppose not. No. But in any way no consideration\r\nabout money has anything to do with it."\r\n\r\n"But I am not that butcher or that baker whom you could love?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Bell; and then she stopped herself from further speech,\r\nnot as intending to convey all her answer in that one word, but as\r\nnot knowing how to fashion any further words.\r\n\r\n"I knew it would be so," said the doctor.\r\n\r\nIt will, I fear, be thought by those who condescend to criticize this\r\nlover\'s conduct and his mode of carrying on his suit, that he was\r\nvery unfit for such work. Ladies will say that he wanted courage, and\r\nmen will say that he wanted wit. I am inclined, however, to believe\r\nthat he behaved as well as men generally do behave on such occasions,\r\nand that he showed himself to be a good average lover. There is your\r\nbold lover, who knocks his lady-love over as he does a bird, and\r\nwho would anathematize himself all over, and swear that his gun was\r\ndistraught, and look about as though he thought the world was coming\r\nto an end, if he missed to knock over his bird. And there is your\r\ntimid lover, who winks his eyes when he fires, who has felt certain\r\nfrom the moment in which he buttoned on his knickerbockers that he\r\nat any rate would kill nothing, and who, when he hears the loud\r\ncongratulations of his friends, cannot believe that he really did\r\nbag that beautiful winged thing by his own prowess. The beautiful\r\nwinged thing which the timid man carries home in his bosom, declining\r\nto have it thrown into a miscellaneous cart, so that it may never\r\nbe lost in a common crowd of game, is better to him than are the\r\nslaughtered hecatombs to those who kill their birds by the hundred.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Crofts had so winked his eye, that he was not in the least\r\naware whether he had winged his bird or no. Indeed, having no one at\r\nhand to congratulate him, he was quite sure that the bird had flown\r\naway uninjured into the next field. "No" was the only word which Bell\r\nhad given in answer to his last sidelong question, and No is not a\r\ncomfortable word to lovers. But there had been that in Bell\'s No\r\nwhich might have taught him that the bird was not escaping without a\r\nwound, if he had still had any of his wits about him.\r\n\r\n"Now I will go," said he. Then he paused for an answer, but none\r\ncame. "And you will understand what I meant when I spoke of being\r\nturned out."\r\n\r\n"Nobody--turns you out." And Bell, as she spoke, had almost descended\r\nto a sob.\r\n\r\n"It is time, at any rate, that I should go; is it not? And, Bell,\r\ndon\'t suppose that this little scene will keep me away from your\r\nsister\'s bedside. I shall be here to-morrow, and you will find that\r\nyou will hardly know me again for the same person." Then in the dark\r\nhe put out his hand to her.\r\n\r\n"Good-by," she said, giving him her hand. He pressed hers very\r\nclosely, but she, though she wished to do so, could not bring herself\r\nto return the pressure. Her hand remained passive in his, showing no\r\nsign of offence; but it was absolutely passive.\r\n\r\n"Good-by, dearest friend," he said.\r\n\r\n"Good-by," she answered,--and then he was gone.\r\n\r\nShe waited quite still till she heard the front-door close after him,\r\nand then she crept silently up to her own bedroom, and sat herself\r\ndown in a low rocking-chair over the fire. It was in accordance with\r\na custom already established that her mother should remain with Lily\r\ntill the tea was ready downstairs; for in these days of illness such\r\ndinners as were provided were eaten early. Bell, therefore, knew that\r\nshe had still some half-hour of her own, during which she might sit\r\nand think undisturbed.\r\n\r\nAnd what naturally should have been her first thoughts?--that she had\r\nruthlessly refused a man who, as she now knew, loved her well, and\r\nfor whom she had always felt at any rate the warmest friendship? Such\r\nwere not her thoughts, nor were they in any way akin to this. They\r\nran back instantly to years gone by,--over long years, as her few\r\nyears were counted,--and settled themselves on certain halcyon days,\r\nin which she had dreamed that he had loved her, and had fancied\r\nthat she had loved him. How she had schooled herself for those days\r\nsince that, and taught herself to know that her thoughts had been\r\nover-bold! And now it had all come round. The only man that she\r\nhad ever liked had loved her. Then there came to her a memory of a\r\ncertain day, in which she had been almost proud to think that Crosbie\r\nhad admired her, in which she had almost hoped that it might be so;\r\nand as she thought of this she blushed, and struck her foot twice\r\nupon the floor. "Dear Lily," she said to herself--"poor Lily!" But\r\nthe feeling which induced her then to think of her sister had had no\r\nrelation to that which had first brought Crosbie into her mind.\r\n\r\nAnd this man had loved her through it all,--this priceless, peerless\r\nman,--this man who was as true to the backbone as that other man had\r\nshown himself to be false; who was as sound as the other man had\r\nproved himself to be rotten. A smile came across her face as she sat\r\nlooking at the fire, thinking of this. A man had loved her, whose\r\nlove was worth possessing. She hardly remembered whether or no she\r\nhad refused him or accepted him. She hardly asked herself what she\r\nwould do. As to all that it was necessary that she should have many\r\nthoughts, but the necessity did not press upon her quite immediately.\r\nFor the present, at any rate, she might sit and triumph;--and thus\r\ntriumphant she sat there till the old nurse came in and told her that\r\nher mother was waiting for her below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR THE WEDDING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: (untitled)]\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth of February was finally settled as the day on which\r\nMr. Crosbie was to be made the happiest of men. A later day had been\r\nat first named, the twenty-seventh or twenty-eighth having been\r\nsuggested as an improvement over the first week in March; but Lady\r\nAmelia had been frightened by Crosbie\'s behaviour on that Sunday\r\nevening, and had made the countess understand that there should be no\r\nunnecessary delay. "He doesn\'t scruple at that kind of thing," Lady\r\nAmelia had said in one of her letters, showing perhaps less trust in\r\nthe potency of her own rank than might have been expected from her.\r\nThe countess, however, had agreed with her, and when Crosbie received\r\nfrom his mother-in-law a very affectionate epistle, setting forth all\r\nthe reasons which would make the fourteenth so much more convenient\r\na day than the twenty-eighth, he was unable to invent an excuse for\r\nnot being made happy a fortnight earlier than the time named in the\r\nbargain. His first impulse had been against yielding, arising from\r\nsome feeling which made him think that more than the bargain ought\r\nnot to be exacted. But what was the use to him of quarrelling? What\r\nthe use, at least, of quarrelling just then? He believed that he\r\ncould more easily enfranchise himself from the De Courcy tyranny when\r\nhe should be once married than he could do now. When Lady Alexandrina\r\nshould be his own he would let her know that he intended to be her\r\nmaster. If in doing so it would be necessary that he should divide\r\nhimself altogether from the De Courcys, such division should be made.\r\nAt the present moment he would yield to them, at any rate in this\r\nmatter. And so the fourteenth of February was fixed for the marriage.\r\n\r\nIn the second week in January Alexandrina came up to look after her\r\nthings; or, in more noble language, to fit herself with becoming\r\nbridal appanages. As she could not properly do all this work alone,\r\nor even under the surveillance and with the assistance of a sister,\r\nLady De Courcy was to come up also. But Alexandrina came first,\r\nremaining with her sister in St. John\'s Wood till the countess should\r\narrive. The countess had never yet condescended to accept of her\r\nson-in-law\'s hospitality, but always went to the cold, comfortless\r\nhouse in Portman Square,--the house which had been the De Courcy town\r\nfamily mansion for many years, and which the countess would long\r\nsince have willingly exchanged for some abode on the other side of\r\nOxford Street; but the earl had been obdurate; his clubs and certain\r\nlodgings which he had occasionally been wont to occupy, were on the\r\nright side of Oxford Street; why should he change his old family\r\nresidence? So the countess was coming up to Portman Square, not\r\nhaving been even asked on this occasion to St. John\'s Wood.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think we\'d better," Mr. Gazebee had said to his wife,\r\nalmost trembling at the renewal of his own proposition.\r\n\r\n"I think not, my dear," Lady Amelia had answered. "Mamma is not very\r\nparticular; but there are little things, you know--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, of course," said Mr. Gazebee; and then the conversation\r\nhad been dropped. He would most willingly have entertained his\r\naugust mother-in-law during her visit to the metropolis, and yet her\r\npresence in his house would have made him miserable as long as she\r\nremained there.\r\n\r\nBut for a week Alexandrina sojourned under Mr. Gazebee\'s roof,\r\nduring which time Crosbie was made happy with all the delights of an\r\nexpectant bridegroom. Of course he was given to understand that he\r\nwas to dine at the Gazebees\' every day, and spend all his evenings\r\nthere; and, under the circumstances, he had no excuse for not doing\r\nso. Indeed, at the present moment, his hours would otherwise have\r\nhung heavily enough upon his hands. In spite of his bold resolution\r\nwith reference to his eye, and his intention not to be debarred from\r\nthe pleasures of society by the marks of the late combat, he had not,\r\nsince that occurrence, frequented his club very closely; and though\r\nLondon was now again becoming fairly full, he did not find himself\r\ngoing out so much as had been his wont. The brilliance of his coming\r\nmarriage did not seem to have added much to his popularity; in\r\nfact, the world,--his world,--was beginning to look coldly at him.\r\nTherefore that daily attendance at St. John\'s Wood was not felt to be\r\nso irksome as might have been expected.\r\n\r\nA residence had been taken for the couple in a very fashionable row\r\nof buildings abutting upon the Bayswater Road, called Princess Royal\r\nCrescent. The house was quite new, and the street being unfinished\r\nhad about it a strong smell of mortar, and a general aspect of\r\nbuilders\' poles and brickbats; but nevertheless, it was acknowledged\r\nto be a quite correct locality. From one end of the crescent a corner\r\nof Hyde Park could be seen, and the other abutted on a very handsome\r\nterrace indeed, in which lived an ambassador,--from South America,--a\r\nfew bankers\' senior clerks, and a peer of the realm. We know how\r\nvile is the sound of Baker Street, and how absolutely foul to the\r\npolite ear is the name of Fitzroy Square. The houses, however, in\r\nthose purlieus are substantial, warm, and of good size. The house in\r\nPrincess Royal Crescent was certainly not substantial, for in these\r\ndays substantially-built houses do not pay. It could hardly have\r\nbeen warm, for, to speak the truth, it was even yet not finished\r\nthroughout; and as for the size, though the drawing-room was a noble\r\napartment, consisting of a section of the whole house, with a corner\r\ncut out for the staircase, it was very much cramped in its other\r\nparts, and was made like a cherub, in this respect, that it had\r\nno rear belonging to it. "But if you have no private fortune of\r\nyour own, you cannot have everything," as the countess observed\r\nwhen Crosbie objected to the house because a closet under the\r\nkitchen-stairs was to be assigned to him as his own dressing-room.\r\n\r\nWhen the question of the house was first debated, Lady Amelia had\r\nbeen anxious that St. John\'s Wood should be selected as the site, but\r\nto this Crosbie had positively objected.\r\n\r\n"I think you don\'t like St. John\'s Wood," Lady Amelia had said to\r\nhim somewhat sternly, thinking to awe him into a declaration that he\r\nentertained no general enmity to the neighbourhood. But Crosbie was\r\nnot weak enough for this.\r\n\r\n"No; I do not," he said. "I have always disliked it. It amounts to a\r\nprejudice, I daresay. But if I were made to live here I am convinced\r\nI should cut my throat in the first six months."\r\n\r\nLady Amelia had then drawn herself up, declaring her sorrow that her\r\nhouse should be so hateful to him.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, no," said he. "I like it very much for you, and enjoy\r\ncoming here of all things. I speak only of the effect which living\r\nhere myself would have upon me."\r\n\r\nLady Amelia was quite clever enough to understand it all; but she\r\nhad her sister\'s interest at heart, and therefore persevered in her\r\naffectionate solicitude for her brother-in-law, giving up that point\r\nas to St. John\'s Wood. Crosbie himself had wished to go to one of the\r\nnew Pimlico squares down near Vauxhall Bridge and the river, actuated\r\nchiefly by consideration of the enormous distance lying between that\r\nlocality and the northern region in which Lady Amelia lived; but\r\nto this Lady Alexandrina had objected strongly. If, indeed, they\r\ncould have achieved Eaton Square, or a street leading out of Eaton\r\nSquare,--if they could have crept on to the hem of the skirt of\r\nBelgravia,--the bride would have been delighted. And at first she was\r\nvery nearly being taken in with the idea that such was the proposal\r\nmade to her. Her geographical knowledge of Pimlico had not been\r\nperfect, and she had nearly fallen into a fatal error. But a friend\r\nhad kindly intervened. "For heaven\'s sake, my dear, don\'t let him\r\ntake you anywhere beyond Eccleston Square!" had been exclaimed to her\r\nin dismay by a faithful married friend. Thus warned, Alexandrina had\r\nbeen firm, and now their tent was to be pitched in Princess Royal\r\nCrescent, from one end of which the Hyde Park may be seen.\r\n\r\nThe furniture had been ordered chiefly under the inspection, and by\r\nthe experience, of the Lady Amelia. Crosbie had satisfied himself\r\nby declaring that she at any rate could get the things cheaper than\r\nhe could buy them, and that he had no taste for such employment.\r\nNevertheless, he had felt that he was being made subject to tyranny\r\nand brought under the thumb of subjection. He could not go cordially\r\ninto this matter of beds and chairs, and, therefore, at last deputed\r\nthe whole matter to the De Courcy faction. And for this there was\r\nanother reason, not hitherto mentioned. Mr. Mortimer Gazebee was\r\nfinding the money with which all the furniture was being bought.\r\nHe, with an honest but almost unintelligible zeal for the De Courcy\r\nfamily, had tied up every shilling on which he could lay his hand\r\nas belonging to Crosbie, in the interest of Lady Alexandrina.\r\nHe had gone to work for her, scraping here and arranging there,\r\nstrapping the new husband down upon the grindstone of his matrimonial\r\nsettlement, as though the future bread of his, Gazebee\'s, own\r\nchildren were dependent on the validity of his legal workmanship.\r\nAnd for this he was not to receive a penny, or gain any advantage,\r\nimmediate or ulterior. It came from his zeal,--his zeal for the\r\ncoronet which Lord De Courcy wore. According to his mind an earl and\r\nan earl\'s belongings were entitled to such zeal. It was the theory\r\nin which he had been educated, and amounted to a worship which,\r\nunconsciously, he practised. Personally, he disliked Lord De Courcy,\r\nwho ill-treated him. He knew that the earl was a heartless, cruel,\r\nbad man. But as an earl he was entitled to an amount of service\r\nwhich no commoner could have commanded from Mr. Gazebee. Mr. Gazebee,\r\nhaving thus tied up all the available funds in favour of Lady\r\nAlexandrina\'s seemingly expected widowhood, was himself providing the\r\nmoney with which the new house was to be furnished. "You can pay me a\r\nhundred and fifty a year with four per cent. till it is liquidated,"\r\nhe had said to Crosbie; and Crosbie had assented with a grunt.\r\nHitherto, though he had lived in London expensively, and as a man\r\nof fashion, he had never owed any one anything. He was now to begin\r\nthat career of owing. But when a clerk in a public office marries an\r\nearl\'s daughter, he cannot expect to have everything his own way.\r\n\r\nLady Amelia had bought the ordinary furniture--the beds, the\r\nstair-carpets, the washing-stands, and the kitchen things.\r\nGazebee had got a bargain of the dinner-table and sideboard. But\r\nLady Alexandrina herself was to come up with reference to the\r\nappurtenances of the drawing-room. It was with reference to matters\r\nof costume that the countess intended to lend her assistance--matters\r\nof costume as to which the bill could not be sent in to Gazebee,\r\nand be paid for by him with five per cent. duly charged against the\r\nbridegroom. The bridal trousseau must be produced by De Courcy\'s\r\nmeans, and, therefore, it was necessary that the countess herself\r\nshould come upon the scene. "I will have no bills, d\'ye hear?"\r\nsnarled the earl, gnashing and snapping upon his words with one\r\nspecially ugly black tooth. "I won\'t have any bills about this\r\naffair." And yet he made no offer of ready money. It was very\r\nnecessary under such circumstances that the countess herself should\r\ncome upon the scene. An ambiguous hint had been conveyed to Mr.\r\nGazebee, during a visit of business which he had lately made to\r\nCourcy Castle, that the milliner\'s bills might as well be pinned\r\non to those of the furniture-makers, the crockery-mongers, and the\r\nlike. The countess, putting it in her own way, had gently suggested\r\nthat the fashion of the thing had changed lately, and that such\r\nan arrangement was considered to be the proper thing among people\r\nwho lived really in the world. But Gazebee was a clear-headed,\r\nhonest man; and he knew the countess. He did not think that such an\r\narrangement could be made on the present occasion. Whereupon the\r\ncountess pushed her suggestion no further, but made up her mind that\r\nshe must come up to London herself.\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant to see the Ladies Amelia and Alexandrina, as they sat\r\nwithin a vast emporium of carpets in Bond Street, asking questions of\r\nthe four men who were waiting upon them, putting their heads together\r\nand whispering, calculating accurately as to extra twopences a yard,\r\nand occasioning as much trouble as it was possible for them to give.\r\nIt was pleasant because they managed their large hoops cleverly among\r\nthe huge rolls of carpets, because they were enjoying themselves\r\nthoroughly, and taking to themselves the homage of the men as clearly\r\ntheir due. But it was not so pleasant to look at Crosbie, who was\r\nfidgeting to get away to his office, to whom no power of choosing\r\nin the matter was really given, and whom the men regarded as being\r\naltogether supernumerary. The ladies had promised to be at the\r\nshop by half-past ten, so that Crosbie should reach his office at\r\neleven--or a little after. But it was nearly eleven before they left\r\nthe Gazebee residence, and it was very evident that half-an-hour\r\namong the carpets would be by no means sufficient. It seemed as\r\nthough miles upon miles of gorgeous colouring were unrolled before\r\nthem; and then when any pattern was regarded as at all practicable,\r\nit was unrolled backwards and forwards till a room was nearly covered\r\nby it. Crosbie felt for the men who were hauling about the huge heaps\r\nof material; but Lady Amelia sat as composed as though it were her\r\nduty to inspect every yard of stuff in the warehouse. "I think we\'ll\r\nlook at that one at the bottom again." Then the men went to work and\r\nremoved a mountain. "No, my dear, that green in the scroll-work won\'t\r\ndo. It would fly directly, if any hot water were spilt." The man\r\nsmiling ineffably, declared that that particular green never flew\r\nanywhere. But Lady Amelia paid no attention to him, and the carpet\r\nfor which the mountain had been removed became part of another\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\n"That might do," said Alexandrina, gazing upon a magnificent crimson\r\nground through which rivers of yellow meandered, carrying with them\r\nin their streams an infinity of blue flowers. And as she spoke she\r\nheld her head gracefully on one side, and looked down upon the carpet\r\ndoubtingly. Lady Amelia poked it with her parasol as though to test\r\nits durability, and whispered something about yellows showing the\r\ndirt. Crosbie took out his watch and groaned.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: "That might do."]\r\n\r\n\r\n"It\'s a superb carpet, my lady, and about the newest thing we have.\r\nWe put down four hundred and fifty yards of it for the Duchess of\r\nSouth Wales, at Cwddglwlch Castle, only last month. Nobody has had\r\nit since, for it has not been in stock." Whereupon Lady Amelia again\r\npoked it, and then got up and walked upon it. Lady Alexandrina held\r\nher head a little more on one side.\r\n\r\n"Five and three?" said Lady Amelia.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, my lady; five and seven; and the cheapest carpet we have\r\nin the house. There is twopence a yard more in the colour; there is,\r\nindeed."\r\n\r\n"And the discount?" asked Lady Amelia.\r\n\r\n"Two and a half, my lady."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no," said Lady Amelia. "I always have five per cent. for\r\nimmediate payment--quite immediate, you know." Upon which the man\r\ndeclared the question must be referred to his master. Two and a half\r\nwas the rule of the house. Crosbie, who had been looking out of the\r\nwindow, said that upon his honour he couldn\'t wait any longer.\r\n\r\n"And what do you think of it, Adolphus?" asked Alexandrina.\r\n\r\n"Think of what?"\r\n\r\n"Of the carpet--this one, you know!"\r\n\r\n"Oh--what do I think of the carpet? I don\'t think I quite like all\r\nthese yellow bands; and isn\'t it too red? I should have thought\r\nsomething brown with a small pattern would have been better. But,\r\nupon my word, I don\'t much care."\r\n\r\n"Of course he doesn\'t," said Lady Amelia. Then the two ladies put\r\ntheir heads together for another five minutes, and the carpet was\r\nchosen--subject to that question of the discount. "And now about the\r\nrug," said Lady Amelia. But here Crosbie rebelled, and insisted that\r\nhe must leave them and go to his office. "You can\'t want me about\r\nthe rug," he said. "Well, perhaps not," said Lady Amelia. But it was\r\nmanifest that Alexandrina did not approve of being thus left by her\r\nmale attendant.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happened in Oxford Street with reference to the chairs\r\nand sofas, and Crosbie began to wish that he were settled, even\r\nthough he should have to dress himself in the closet below the\r\nkitchen-stairs. He was learning to hate the whole household in St.\r\nJohn\'s Wood, and almost all that belonged to it. He was introduced\r\nthere to little family economies of which hitherto he had known\r\nnothing, and which were disgusting to him, and the necessity for\r\nwhich was especially explained to him. It was to men placed as he\r\nwas about to place himself that these economies were so vitally\r\nessential--to men who with limited means had to maintain a decorous\r\noutward face towards the fashionable world. Ample supplies of\r\nbutchers\' meat and unlimited washing-bills might be very well upon\r\nfifteen hundred a year to those who went out but seldom, and who\r\ncould use the first cab that came to hand when they did go out.\r\nBut there were certain things that Lady Alexandrina must do, and\r\ntherefore the strictest household economy became necessary. Would\r\nLily Dale have required the use of a carriage, got up to look as\r\nthough it were private, at the expense of her husband\'s beefsteaks\r\nand clean shirts? That question and others of that nature were asked\r\nby Crosbie within his own mind, not unfrequently.\r\n\r\nBut, nevertheless, he tried to love Alexandrina, or rather to\r\npersuade himself that he loved her. If he could only get her away\r\nfrom the De Courcy faction, and especially from the Gazebee branch\r\nof it, he would break her of all that. He would teach her to sit\r\ntriumphantly in a street cab, and to cater for her table with a\r\nplentiful hand. Teach her!--at some age over thirty; and with such\r\ncareful training as she had already received! Did he intend to forbid\r\nher ever again to see her relations, ever to go to St. John\'s Wood,\r\nor to correspond with the countess and Lady Margaretta? Teach her,\r\nindeed! Had he yet to learn that he could not wash a blackamoor\r\nwhite?--that he could not have done so even had he himself been\r\nwell adapted for the attempt, whereas he was in truth nearly as ill\r\nadapted as a man might be? But who could pity him? Lily, whom he\r\nmight have had in his bosom, would have been no blackamoor.\r\n\r\nThen came the time of Lady De Courcy\'s visit to town, and Alexandrina\r\nmoved herself off to Portman Square. There was some apparent comfort\r\nin this to Crosbie, for he would thereby be saved from those daily\r\ndreary journeys up to the north-west. I may say that he positively\r\nhated that windy corner near the church, round which he had to walk\r\nin getting to the Gazebee residence, and that he hated the lamp which\r\nguided him to the door, and the very door itself. This door stood\r\nburied as it were in a wall, and opened on to a narrow passage which\r\nran across a so-called garden, or front yard, containing on each side\r\ntwo iron receptacles for geraniums, painted to look like Palissy\r\nware, and a naked female on a pedestal. No spot in London was, as he\r\nthought, so cold as the bit of pavement immediately in front of that\r\ndoor. And there he would be kept five, ten, fifteen minutes, as he\r\ndeclared--though I believe in my heart that the time never exceeded\r\nthree,--while Richard was putting off the trappings of his work and\r\nputting on the trappings of his grandeur.\r\n\r\nIf people would only have their doors opened to you by such\r\nassistance as may come most easily and naturally to the work! I stood\r\nlately for some minutes on a Tuesday afternoon at a gallant portal,\r\nand as I waxed impatient a pretty maiden came and opened it. She\r\nwas a pretty maiden, though her hands and face and apron told tales\r\nof the fire-grates. "Laws, sir," she said, "the visitors\' day is\r\nWednesday; and if you would come then, there would be the man in\r\nlivery!" She took my card with the corner of her apron, and did just\r\nas well as the man in livery; but what would have happened to her had\r\nher little speech been overheard by her mistress?\r\n\r\nCrosbie hated the house in St. John\'s Wood, and therefore the coming\r\nof the countess was a relief to him. Portman Square was easily to be\r\nreached, and the hospitalities of the countess would not be pressed\r\nupon him so strongly as those of the Gazebees. When he first called\r\nhe was shown into the great family dining-room, which looked out\r\ntowards the back of the house. The front windows were, of course,\r\nclosed, as the family was not supposed to be in London. Here he\r\nremained in the room for some quarter of an hour, and then the\r\ncountess descended upon him in all her grandeur. Perhaps he had never\r\nbefore seen her so grand. Her dress was very large, and rustled\r\nthrough the broad doorway, as if demanding even a broader passage.\r\nShe had on a wonder of a bonnet, and a velvet mantle that was nearly\r\nas expansive as her petticoats. She threw her head a little back as\r\nshe accosted him, and he instantly perceived that he was enveloped\r\nin the fumes of an affectionate but somewhat contemptuous patronage.\r\nIn old days he had liked the countess, because her manner to him had\r\nalways been flattering. In his intercourse with her he had been able\r\nto feel that he gave quite as much as he got, and that the countess\r\nwas aware of the fact. In all the circumstances of their acquaintance\r\nthe ascendancy had been with him, and therefore the acquaintance had\r\nbeen a pleasant one. The countess had been a good-natured, agreeable\r\nwoman, whose rank and position had made her house pleasant to him;\r\nand therefore he had consented to shine upon her with such light as\r\nhe had to give. Why was it that the matter was reversed, now that\r\nthere was so much stronger a cause for good feeling between them? He\r\nknew that there was such change, and with bitter internal upbraidings\r\nhe acknowledged to himself that this woman was getting the mastery\r\nover him. As the friend of the countess he had been a great man in\r\nher eyes;--in all her little words and looks she had acknowledged his\r\npower; but now, as her son-in-law, he was to become a very little\r\nman,--such as was Mortimer Gazebee!\r\n\r\n"My dear Adolphus," she said, taking both his hands, "the day is\r\ncoming very near now; is it not?"\r\n\r\n"Very near, indeed," he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is very near. I hope you feel yourself a happy man."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, that\'s of course."\r\n\r\n"It ought to be. Speaking very seriously, I mean that it ought to be\r\na matter of course. She is everything that a man should desire in a\r\nwife. I am not alluding now to her rank, though of course you feel\r\nwhat a great advantage she gives you in this respect."\r\n\r\nCrosbie muttered something as to his consciousness of having drawn a\r\nprize in the lottery; but he so muttered it as not to convey to the\r\nlady\'s ears a proper sense of his dependent gratitude. "I know of no\r\nman more fortunate than you have been," she continued; "and I hope\r\nthat my dear girl will find that you are fully aware that it is so.\r\nI think that she is looking rather fagged. You have allowed her to do\r\nmore than was good for her in the way of shopping."\r\n\r\n"She has done a good deal, certainly," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"She is so little used to anything of that kind! But of course, as\r\nthings have turned out, it was necessary that she should see to these\r\nthings herself."\r\n\r\n"I rather think she liked it," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"I believe she will always like doing her duty. We are just going now\r\nto Madame Millefranc\'s, to see some silks;--perhaps you would wish to\r\ngo with us?"\r\n\r\nJust at this moment Alexandrina came into the room, and looked as\r\nthough she were in all respects a smaller edition of her mother.\r\nThey were both well-grown women, with handsome, large figures, and a\r\ncertain air about them which answered almost for beauty. As to the\r\ncountess, her face, on close inspection, bore, as it was entitled\r\nto do, deep signs of age; but she so managed her face that any such\r\nclose inspection was never made; and her general appearance for her\r\ntime of life was certainly good. Very little more than this could be\r\nsaid in favour of her daughter.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no, mamma," she said, having heard her mother\'s last words.\r\n"He\'s the worst person in a shop in the world. He likes nothing, and\r\ndislikes nothing. Do you, Adolphus?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I do. I like all the cheap things, and dislike all the dear\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n"Then you certainly shall not go with us to Madame Millefranc\'s,"\r\nsaid Alexandrina.\r\n\r\n"It would not matter to him there, you know, my dear," said the\r\ncountess, thinking perhaps of the suggestion she had lately made to\r\nMr. Gazebee.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Crosbie managed to escape, simply promising to\r\nreturn to Portman Square in the evening after dinner. "By-the-by,\r\nAdolphus," said the countess, as he handed her into the hired\r\ncarriage which stood at the door, "I wish you would go to Lambert\'s,\r\non Ludgate Hill, for me. He has had a bracelet of mine for nearly\r\nthree months. Do, there\'s a good creature. Get it if you can, and\r\nbring it up this evening."\r\n\r\nCrosbie, as he made his way back to his office, swore that he would\r\nnot do the bidding of the countess. He would not trudge off into\r\nthe city after her trinkets. But at five o\'clock, when he left his\r\noffice, he did go there. He apologized to himself by saying that he\r\nhad nothing else to do, and bethought himself that at the present\r\nmoment his lady mother-in-law\'s smiles might be more convenient than\r\nher frowns. So he went to Lambert\'s, on Ludgate Hill, and there\r\nlearned that the bracelet had been sent down to Courcy Castle full\r\ntwo months since.\r\n\r\nAfter that he dined at his club, at Sebright\'s. He dined alone,\r\nsitting by no means in bliss with his half-pint of sherry on the\r\ntable before him. A man now and then came up and spoke to him, one a\r\nfew words, and another a few, and two or three congratulated him as\r\nto his marriage; but the club was not the same thing to him as it had\r\nformerly been. He did not stand in the centre of the rug, speaking\r\nindifferently to all or any around him, ready with his joke, and\r\nloudly on the alert with the last news of the day. How easy it is to\r\nbe seen when any man has fallen from his pride of place, though the\r\naltitude was ever so small, and the fall ever so slight. Where is the\r\nman who can endure such a fall without showing it in his face, in his\r\nvoice, in his step, and in every motion of every limb? Crosbie knew\r\nthat he had fallen, and showed that he knew it by the manner in which\r\nhe ate his mutton chop.\r\n\r\nAt half-past eight he was again in Portman Square, and found the\r\ntwo ladies crowding over a small fire in a small back drawing-room.\r\nThe furniture was all covered with brown holland, and the place\r\nhad about it that cold comfortless feeling which uninhabited rooms\r\nalways produce. Crosbie, as he had walked from the club up to Portman\r\nSquare, had indulged in some serious thoughts. The kind of life which\r\nhe had hitherto led had certainly passed away from him. He could\r\nnever again be the pet of a club, or indulged as one to whom all good\r\nthings were to be given without any labour at earning them on his own\r\npart. Such for some years had been his good fortune, but such could\r\nbe his good fortune no longer. Was there anything within his reach\r\nwhich he might take in lieu of that which he had lost? He might still\r\nbe victorious at his office, having more capacity for such victory\r\nthan others around him. But such success alone would hardly suffice\r\nfor him. Then he considered whether he might not even yet be happy in\r\nhis own home,--whether Alexandrina, when separated from her mother,\r\nmight not become such a wife as he could love. Nothing softens a\r\nman\'s feelings so much as failure, or makes him turn so anxiously\r\nto an idea of home as buffetings from those he meets abroad. He\r\nhad abandoned Lily because his outer world had seemed to him too\r\nbright to be deserted. He would endeavour to supply her place with\r\nAlexandrina, because his outer world had seemed to him too harsh to\r\nbe supported. Alas! alas! a man cannot so easily repent of his sins,\r\nand wash himself white from their stains!\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the room the two ladies were sitting over the fire,\r\nas I have stated, and Crosbie could immediately perceive that the\r\nspirit of the countess was not serene. In fact there had been a few\r\nwords between the mother and child on that matter of the trousseau,\r\nand Alexandrina had plainly told her mother that if she were to be\r\nmarried at all she would be married with such garments belonging to\r\nher as were fitting for an earl\'s daughter. It was in vain that her\r\nmother had explained with many circumlocutional phrases, that the\r\nfitness in this respect should be accommodated rather to the plebeian\r\nhusband than to the noble parent. Alexandrina had been very firm, and\r\nhad insisted on her rights, giving the countess to understand that if\r\nher orders for finery were not complied with, she would return as a\r\nspinster to Courcy, and prepare herself for partnership with Rosina.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said the countess, piteously, "you can have no idea of\r\nwhat I shall have to go through with your father. And, of course, you\r\ncould get all these things afterwards."\r\n\r\n"Papa has no right to treat me in such a way. And if he would not\r\ngive me any money himself, he should have let me have some of my\r\nown."\r\n\r\n"Ah, my dear, that was Mr. Gazebee\'s fault."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care whose fault it was. It certainly was not mine. I\r\nwon\'t have him to tell me"--"him" was intended to signify Adolphus\r\nCrosbie--"that he had to pay for my wedding-clothes."\r\n\r\n"Of course not that, my dear."\r\n\r\n"No; nor yet for the things which I wanted immediately. I\'d much\r\nrather go and tell him at once that the marriage must be put off."\r\n\r\nAlexandrina of course carried her point, the countess reflecting with\r\na maternal devotion equal almost to that of the pelican, that the\r\nearl could not do more than kill her. So the things were ordered as\r\nAlexandrina chose to order them, and the countess desired that the\r\nbills might be sent in to Mr. Gazebee. Much self-devotion had been\r\ndisplayed by the mother, but the mother thought that none had been\r\ndisplayed by the daughter, and therefore she had been very cross with\r\nAlexandrina.\r\n\r\nCrosbie, taking a chair, sat himself between them, and in a very\r\ngood-humoured tone explained the little affair of the bracelet. "Your\r\nladyship\'s memory must have played you false," said he, with a smile.\r\n\r\n"My memory is very good," said the countess; "very good indeed. If\r\nTwitch got it, and didn\'t tell me, that was not my fault." Twitch was\r\nher ladyship\'s lady\'s-maid. Crosbie, seeing how the land lay, said\r\nnothing more about the bracelet.\r\n\r\nAfter a minute or two he put out his hand to take that of\r\nAlexandrina. They were to be married now in a week or two, and such a\r\nsign of love might have been allowed to him, even in the presence of\r\nthe bride\'s mother. He did succeed in getting hold of her fingers,\r\nbut found in them none of the softness of a response. "Don\'t," said\r\nLady Alexandrina, withdrawing her hand; and the tone of her voice as\r\nshe spoke the word was not sweet to his ears. He remembered at the\r\nmoment a certain scene which took place one evening at the little\r\nbridge at Allington, and Lily\'s voice, and Lily\'s words, and Lily\'s\r\npassion, as he caressed her: "Oh, my love, my love, my love!"\r\n\r\n"My dear," said the countess, "they know how tired I am. I wonder\r\nwhether they are going to give us any tea." Whereupon Crosbie rang\r\nthe bell, and, on resuming his chair, moved it a little farther away\r\nfrom his lady-love.\r\n\r\nPresently the tea was brought to them by the housekeeper\'s assistant,\r\nwho did not appear to have made herself very smart for the occasion,\r\nand Crosbie thought that he was _de trop_. This, however, was a\r\nmistake on his part. As he had been admitted into the family, such\r\nlittle matters were no longer subject of care. Two or three months\r\nsince, the countess would have fainted at the idea of such a domestic\r\nappearing with a tea-tray before Mr. Crosbie. Now, however, she\r\nwas utterly indifferent to any such consideration. Crosbie was to\r\nbe admitted into the family, thereby becoming entitled to certain\r\nprivileges,--and thereby also becoming subject to certain domestic\r\ndrawbacks. In Mrs. Dale\'s little household there had been no rising\r\nto grandeur; but then, also, there had never been any bathos of dirt.\r\nOf this also Crosbie thought as he sat with his tea in his hand.\r\n\r\nHe soon, however, got himself away. When he rose to go Alexandrina\r\nalso rose, and he was permitted to press his nose against her\r\ncheekbone by way of a salute.\r\n\r\n"Good-night, Adolphus," said the countess, putting out her hand to\r\nhim. "But stop a minute; I know there is something I want you to\r\ndo for me. But you will look in as you go to your office to-morrow\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC TROUBLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Crosbie was making his ineffectual inquiry after Lady De\r\nCourcy\'s bracelet at Lambert\'s, John Eames was in the act of entering\r\nMrs. Roper\'s front door in Burton Crescent.\r\n\r\n"Oh, John, where\'s Mr. Cradell?" were the first words which greeted\r\nhim, and they were spoken by the divine Amelia. Now, in her usual\r\npractice of life, Amelia did not interest herself much as to the\r\nwhereabouts of Mr. Cradell.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Cradell?" said Eames, repeating the question. "Upon my word,\r\nI don\'t know. I walked to the office with him, but I haven\'t seen him\r\nsince. We don\'t sit in the same room, you know."\r\n\r\n"John!" and then she stopped.\r\n\r\n"What\'s up now?" said John.\r\n\r\n"John! That woman\'s off and left her husband. As sure as your name\'s\r\nJohn Eames, that foolish fellow has gone off with her."\r\n\r\n"What, Cradell? I don\'t believe it."\r\n\r\n"She went out of this house at two o\'clock in the afternoon, and has\r\nnever been back since." That, certainly, was only four hours from\r\nthe present time, and such an absence from home in the middle of\r\nthe day was but weak evidence on which to charge a married woman\r\nwith the great sin of running off with a lover. This Amelia felt,\r\nand therefore she went on to explain. "He\'s there upstairs in the\r\ndrawing-room, the very picture of disconsolateness."\r\n\r\n"Who,--Cradell?"\r\n\r\n"Lupex is. He\'s been drinking a little, I\'m afraid; but he\'s very\r\nunhappy, indeed. He had an appointment to meet his wife here at four\r\no\'clock, and when he came he found her gone. He rushed up into their\r\nroom, and now he says she has broken open a box he had and taken off\r\nall his money."\r\n\r\n"But he never had any money."\r\n\r\n"He paid mother some the day before yesterday."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just the reason he shouldn\'t have any to-day."\r\n\r\n"She certainly has taken things she wouldn\'t have taken if she\'d\r\nmerely gone out shopping or anything like that, for I\'ve been up in\r\nthe room and looked about it. She\'d three necklaces. They weren\'t\r\nmuch account; but she must have them all on, or else have got them in\r\nher pocket."\r\n\r\n"Cradell has never gone off with her in that way. He may be a fool--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, he is, you know. I\'ve never seen such a fool about a woman as he\r\nhas been."\r\n\r\n"But he wouldn\'t be a party to stealing a lot of trumpery trinkets,\r\nor taking her husband\'s money. Indeed, I don\'t think he has anything\r\nto do with it." Then Eames thought over the circumstances of the\r\nday, and remembered that he had certainly not seen Cradell since\r\nthe morning. It was that public servant\'s practice to saunter into\r\nEames\'s room in the middle of the day, and there consume bread and\r\ncheese and beer,--in spite of an assertion which Johnny had once made\r\nas to crumbs of biscuit bathed in ink. But on this special day he had\r\nnot done so. "I can\'t think he has been such a fool as that," said\r\nJohnny.\r\n\r\n"But he has," said Amelia. "It\'s dinner-time now, and where is he?\r\nHad he any money left, Johnny?"\r\n\r\nSo interrogated, Eames disclosed a secret confided to him by his\r\nfriend which no other circumstances would have succeeded in dragging\r\nfrom his breast.\r\n\r\n"She borrowed twelve pounds from him about a fortnight since,\r\nimmediately after quarter-day. And she owed him money, too, before\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Oh, what a soft!" exclaimed Amelia; "and he hasn\'t paid mother a\r\nshilling for the last two months!"\r\n\r\n"It was his money, perhaps, that Mrs. Roper got from Lupex the day\r\nbefore yesterday. If so, it comes to the same thing as far as she is\r\nconcerned, you know."\r\n\r\n"And what are we to do now?" said Amelia, as she went before her\r\nlover upstairs. "Oh, John, what will become of me if ever you serve\r\nme in that way? What should I do if you were to go off with another\r\nlady?"\r\n\r\n"Lupex hasn\'t gone off," said Eames, who hardly knew what to say\r\nwhen the matter was brought before him with so closely personal a\r\nreference.\r\n\r\n"But it\'s the same thing," said Amelia. "Hearts is divided. Hearts\r\nthat have been joined together ought never to be divided; ought\r\nthey?" And then she hung upon his arm just as they got to the\r\ndrawing-room door.\r\n\r\n"Hearts and darts are all my eye," said Johnny. "My belief is that\r\na man had better never marry at all. How d\'you do, Mr. Lupex? Is\r\nanything the matter?"\r\n\r\nMr. Lupex was seated on a chair in the middle of the room, and was\r\nleaning with his head over the back of it. So despondent was he in\r\nhis attitude that his head would have fallen off and rolled on to the\r\nfloor, had it followed the course which its owner seemed to intend\r\nthat it should take. His hands hung down also along the back legs of\r\nthe chair, till his fingers almost touched the ground, and altogether\r\nhis appearance was pendent, drooping, and wobegone. Miss Spruce\r\nwas seated in one corner of the room, with her hands folded in her\r\nlap before her, and Mrs. Roper was standing on the rug with a look\r\nof severe virtue on her brow,--of virtue which, to judge by its\r\nappearance, was very severe. Nor was its severity intended to be\r\nexercised solely against Mrs. Lupex. Mrs. Roper was becoming very\r\ntired of Mr. Lupex also, and would not have been unhappy if he also\r\nhad run away,--leaving behind him so much of his property as would\r\nhave paid his bill.\r\n\r\nMr. Lupex did not stir when first addressed by John Eames, but a\r\ncertain convulsive movement was to be seen on the back of his head,\r\nindicating that this new arrival in the drawing-room had produced\r\na fresh accession of agony. The chair, too, quivered under him, and\r\nhis fingers stretched themselves nearer to the ground and shook\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Lupex, we\'re going to dinner immediately," said Mrs. Roper. "Mr.\r\nEames, where is your friend, Mr. Cradell?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I don\'t know," said Eames.\r\n\r\n"But I know," said Lupex, jumping up and standing at his full height,\r\nwhile he knocked down the chair which had lately supported him. "The\r\ntraitor to domestic bliss! I know. And wherever he is, he has that\r\nfalse woman in his arms. Would he were here!" And as he expressed\r\nthe last wish he went through a motion with his hands and arms which\r\nseemed intended to signify that if that unfortunate young man were in\r\nthe company he would pull him in pieces and double him up, and pack\r\nhim close, and then despatch his remains off, through infinite space,\r\nto the Prince of Darkness. "Traitor," he exclaimed, as he finished\r\nthe process. "False traitor! Foul traitor! And she too!" Then, as he\r\nthought of this softer side of the subject, he prepared himself to\r\nrelapse again on to the chair. Finding it on the ground he had to\r\npick it up. He did pick it up, and once more flung away his head over\r\nthe back of it, and stretched his finger-nails almost down to the\r\ncarpet.\r\n\r\n"James," said Mrs. Roper to her son, who was now in the room, "I\r\nthink you\'d better stay with Mr. Lupex while we are at dinner. Come,\r\nMiss Spruce, I\'m very sorry that you should be annoyed by this kind\r\nof thing."\r\n\r\n"It don\'t hurt me," said Miss Spruce, preparing to leave the room.\r\n"I\'m only an old woman."\r\n\r\n"Annoyed!" said Lupex, raising himself again from his chair, not\r\nperhaps altogether disposed to remain upstairs while the dinner, for\r\nwhich it was intended that he should some day pay, was being eaten\r\nbelow. "Annoyed! It is a profound sorrow to me that any lady should\r\nbe annoyed by my misfortunes. As regards Miss Spruce, I look upon her\r\ncharacter with profound veneration."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t mind me; I\'m only an old woman," said Miss Spruce.\r\n\r\n"But, by heavens, I do mind!" exclaimed Lupex; and hurrying forward\r\nhe seized Miss Spruce by the hand. "I shall always regard age as\r\nentitled--" But the special privileges which Mr. Lupex would have\r\naccorded to age were never made known to the inhabitants of Mrs.\r\nRoper\'s boarding-house, for the door of the room was again opened at\r\nthis moment, and Mr. Cradell entered.\r\n\r\n"Here you are, old fellow, to answer for yourself," said Eames.\r\n\r\nCradell, who had heard something as he came in at the front door,\r\nbut had not heard that Lupex was in the drawing-room, made a slight\r\nstart backwards when he saw that gentleman\'s face. "Upon my word and\r\nhonour," he began;--but he was able to carry his speech no further.\r\nLupex, dropping the hand of the elderly lady whom he reverenced, was\r\nupon him in an instant, and Cradell was shaking beneath his grasp\r\nlike an aspen leaf,--or rather not like an aspen leaf, unless an\r\naspen leaf when shaken is to be seen with its eyes shut, its mouth\r\nopen, and its tongue hanging out.\r\n\r\n"Come, I say," said Eames, stepping forward to his friend\'s\r\nassistance; "this won\'t do at all, Mr. Lupex. You\'ve been drinking.\r\nYou\'d better wait till to-morrow morning, and speak to Cradell then."\r\n\r\n"To-morrow morning, viper," shouted Lupex, still holding his prey,\r\nbut looking back at Eames over his shoulder. Who the viper was had\r\nnot been clearly indicated. "When will he restore to me my wife? When\r\nwill he restore to me my honour?"\r\n\r\n"Upon-on-on-on my--" It was for the moment in vain that poor Mr.\r\nCradell endeavoured to asseverate his innocence, and to stake his\r\nhonour upon his own purity as regarded Mrs. Lupex. Lupex still held\r\nto his enemy\'s cravat, though Eames had now got him by the arm, and\r\nso far impeded his movements as to hinder him from proceeding to any\r\ngraver attack.\r\n\r\n"Jemima, Jemima, Jemima!" shouted Mrs. Roper. "Run for the police;\r\nrun for the police!" But Amelia, who had more presence of mind than\r\nher mother, stopped Jemima as she was making to one of the front\r\nwindows. "Keep where you are," said Amelia. "They\'ll come quiet in a\r\nminute or two." And Amelia no doubt was right. Calling for the police\r\nwhen there is a row in the house is like summoning the water-engines\r\nwhen the soot is on fire in the kitchen chimney. In such cases good\r\nmanagement will allow the soot to burn itself out, without aid from\r\nthe water-engines. In the present instance the police were not called\r\nin, and I am inclined to think that their presence would not have\r\nbeen advantageous to any of the party.\r\n\r\n"Upon-my-honour--I know nothing about her," were the first words\r\nwhich Cradell was able to articulate, when Lupex, under Eames\'s\r\npersuasion, at last relaxed his hold.\r\n\r\nLupex turned round to Miss Spruce with a sardonic grin. "You hear his\r\nwords,--this enemy to domestic bliss,--Ha, ha! man, tell me whither\r\nyou have conveyed my wife!"\r\n\r\n"If you were to give me the Bank of England I don\'t know," said\r\nCradell.\r\n\r\n"And I\'m sure he does not know," said Mrs. Roper, whose suspicions\r\nagainst Cradell were beginning to subside. But as her suspicions\r\nsubsided, her respect for him decreased. Such was the case also with\r\nMiss Spruce, and with Amelia, and with Jemima. They had all thought\r\nhim to be a great fool for running away with Mrs. Lupex, but now\r\nthey were beginning to think him a poor creature because he had not\r\ndone so. Had he committed that active folly he would have been an\r\ninteresting fool. But now, if, as they all suspected, he knew no\r\nmore about Mrs. Lupex than they did, he would be a fool without any\r\nspecial interest whatever.\r\n\r\n"Of course he doesn\'t," said Eames.\r\n\r\n"No more than I do," said Amelia.\r\n\r\n"His very looks show him innocent," said Mrs. Roper.\r\n\r\n"Indeed they do," said Miss Spruce.\r\n\r\nLupex turned from one to the other as they thus defended the man\r\nwhom he suspected, and shook his head at each assertion that was\r\nmade. "And if he doesn\'t know who does?" he asked. "Haven\'t I seen\r\nit all for the last three months? Is it reasonable to suppose that\r\na creature such as she, used to domestic comforts all her life,\r\nshould have gone off in this way, at dinner-time, taking with her my\r\nproperty and all her jewels, and that nobody should have instigated\r\nher; nobody assisted her! Is that a story to tell to such a man as\r\nme! You may tell it to the marines!" Mr. Lupex, as he made this\r\nspeech, was walking about the room, and as he finished it he threw\r\nhis pocket-handkerchief with violence on to the floor. "I know what\r\nto do, Mrs. Roper," he said. "I know what steps to take. I shall put\r\nthe affair into the hands of my lawyer to-morrow morning." Then he\r\npicked up his handkerchief and walked down into the dining-room.\r\n\r\n"Of course you know nothing about it?" said Eames to his friend,\r\nhaving run upstairs for the purpose of saying a word to him while he\r\nwashed his hands.\r\n\r\n"What,--about Maria? I don\'t know where she is, if you mean that."\r\n\r\n"Of course I mean that. What else should I mean? And what makes you\r\ncall her Maria?"\r\n\r\n"It is wrong. I admit it\'s wrong. The word will come out, you know."\r\n\r\n"Will come out! I\'ll tell you what it is, old fellow, you\'ll get\r\nyourself into a mess, and all for nothing. That fellow will have you\r\nup before the police for stealing his things--"\r\n\r\n"But, Johnny--"\r\n\r\n"I know all about it. Of course you have not stolen them, and of\r\ncourse there was nothing to steal. But if you go on calling her Maria\r\nyou\'ll find that he\'ll have a pull on you. Men don\'t call other men\'s\r\nwives names for nothing."\r\n\r\n"Of course we\'ve been friends," said Cradell, who rather liked this\r\nview of the matter.\r\n\r\n"Yes,--you have been friends! She\'s diddled you out of your money,\r\nand that\'s the beginning and the end of it. And now, if you go on\r\nshowing off your friendship, you\'ll be done out of more money. You\'re\r\nmaking an ass of yourself. That\'s the long and the short of it."\r\n\r\n"And what have you made of yourself with that girl? There are worse\r\nasses than I am yet, Master Johnny." Eames, as he had no answer ready\r\nto this counter attack, left the room and went downstairs. Cradell\r\nsoon followed him, and in a few minutes they were all eating their\r\ndinner together at Mrs. Roper\'s hospitable table.\r\n\r\nImmediately after dinner Lupex took himself away, and the\r\nconversation upstairs became general on the subject of the lady\'s\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\n"If I was him I\'d never ask a question about her, but let her go,"\r\nsaid Amelia.\r\n\r\n"Yes; and then have all her bills following you, wherever you went,"\r\nsaid Amelia\'s brother.\r\n\r\n"I\'d sooner have her bills than herself," said Eames.\r\n\r\n"My belief is, that she\'s been an ill-used woman," said Cradell. "If\r\nshe had a husband that she could respect and have loved, and all that\r\nsort of thing, she would have been a charming woman."\r\n\r\n"She\'s every bit as bad as he is," said Mrs. Roper.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t agree with you, Mrs. Roper," continued the lady\'s champion.\r\n"Perhaps I ought to understand her position better than any one here,\r\nand--"\r\n\r\n"Then that\'s just what you ought not to do, Mr. Cradell," said Mrs.\r\nRoper. And now the lady of the house spoke out her mind with much\r\nmaternal dignity and with some feminine severity. "That\'s just what\r\na young man like you has no business to know. What\'s a married\r\nwoman like that to you, or you to her; or what have you to do with\r\nunderstanding her position? When you\'ve a wife of your own, if ever\r\nyou do have one, you\'ll find you\'ll have trouble enough then without\r\nanybody else interfering with you. Not but what I believe you\'re\r\ninnocent as a lamb about Mrs. Lupex; that is, as far as any harm\r\ngoes. But you\'ve got yourself into all this trouble by meddling, and\r\nwas like enough to get yourself choked upstairs by that man. And\r\nwho\'s to wonder when you go on pretending to be in love with a woman\r\nin that way, and she old enough to be your mother? What would your\r\nmamma say if she saw you at it?"\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Cradell.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all very well your laughing, but I hate such folly. If I see a\r\nyoung man in love with a young woman, I respect him for it;" and then\r\nshe looked at Johnny Eames. "I respect him for it,--even though he\r\nmay now and then do things as he shouldn\'t. They most of \'em does\r\nthat. But to see a young man like you, Mr. Cradell, dangling after an\r\nold married woman, who doesn\'t know how to behave herself; and all\r\njust because she lets him to do it;--ugh!--an old broomstick with a\r\npetticoat on would do just as well! It makes me sick to see it, and\r\nthat\'s the truth of it. I don\'t call it manly; and it ain\'t manly, is\r\nit, Miss Spruce?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I know nothing about it," said the lady to whom the appeal\r\nwas thus made. "But a young gentleman should keep himself to himself\r\ntill the time comes for him to speak out,--begging your pardon all\r\nthe same, Mr. Cradell."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what a married woman should want with any one after her\r\nbut her own husband," said Amelia.\r\n\r\n"And perhaps not always that," said John Eames.\r\n\r\nIt was about an hour after this when the front-door bell was rung,\r\nand a scream from Jemima announced to them all that some critical\r\nmoment had arrived. Amelia, jumping up, opened the door, and then the\r\nrustle of a woman\'s dress was heard on the lower stairs. "Oh, laws,\r\nma\'am, you have given us sich a turn," said Jemima. "We all thought\r\nyou was run away."\r\n\r\n"It\'s Mrs. Lupex," said Amelia. And in two minutes more that ill-used\r\nlady was in the room.\r\n\r\n"Well, my dears," said she, gaily, "I hope nobody has waited dinner."\r\n\r\n"No; we didn\'t wait dinner," said Mrs. Roper, very gravely.\r\n\r\n"And where\'s my Orson? Didn\'t he dine at home? Mr. Cradell, will you\r\noblige me by taking my shawl? But perhaps you had better not. People\r\nare so censorious; ain\'t they, Miss Spruce? Mr. Eames shall do it;\r\nand everybody knows that that will be quite safe. Won\'t it, Miss\r\nAmelia?"\r\n\r\n"Quite, I should think," said Amelia. And Mrs. Lupex knew that she\r\nwas not to look for an ally in that quarter on the present occasion.\r\nEames got up to take the shawl, and Mrs. Lupex went on.\r\n\r\n"And didn\'t Orson dine at home? Perhaps they kept him down at the\r\ntheatre. But I\'ve been thinking all day what fun it would be when he\r\nthought his bird was flown."\r\n\r\n"He did dine at home," said Mrs. Roper; "and he didn\'t seem to like\r\nit. There wasn\'t much fun, I can assure you."\r\n\r\n"Ah, wasn\'t there, though? I believe that man would like to have me\r\ntied to his button-hole. I came across a few friends,--lady friends,\r\nMr. Cradell, though two of them had their husbands; so we made a\r\nparty, and just went down to Hampton Court. So my gentleman has gone\r\nagain, has he? That\'s what I get for gadding about myself, isn\'t it,\r\nMiss Spruce?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Roper, as she went to bed that night, made up her mind that,\r\nwhatever might be the cost and trouble of doing so, she would lose no\r\nfurther time in getting rid of her married guests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nLILY\'S BEDSIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLily Dale\'s constitution was good, and her recovery was retarded by\r\nno relapse or lingering debility; but, nevertheless, she was forced\r\nto keep her bed for many days after the fever had left her. During\r\nall this period Dr. Crofts came every day. It was in vain that Mrs.\r\nDale begged him not to do so; telling him in simple words that she\r\nfelt herself bound not to accept from him all this continuation of\r\nhis unremunerated labours now that the absolute necessity for them\r\nwas over. He answered her only by little jokes, or did not answer her\r\nat all; but still he came daily, almost always at the same hour, just\r\nas the day was waning, so that he could sit for a quarter of an hour\r\nin the dusk, and then ride home to Guestwick in the dark. At this\r\ntime Bell had been admitted into her sister\'s room, and she would\r\nalways meet Dr. Crofts at Lily\'s bedside; but she never sat with\r\nhim alone, since the day on which he had offered her his love with\r\nhalf-articulated words, and she had declined it with words also\r\nhalf-articulated. She had seen him alone since that, on the stairs,\r\nor standing in the hall, but she had not remained with him, talking\r\nto him after her old fashion, and no further word of his love had\r\nbeen spoken in speech either half or wholly articulate.\r\n\r\nNor had Bell spoken of what had passed to any one else. Lily would\r\nprobably have told both her mother and sister instantly; but then no\r\nsuch scene as that which had taken place with Bell would have been\r\npossible with Lily. In whatever way the matter might have gone with\r\nher, there would certainly have been some clear tale to tell when\r\nthe interview was over. She would have known whether or no she loved\r\nthe man, or could love him, and would have given him some true and\r\nintelligible answer. Bell had not done so, but had given him an\r\nanswer which, if true, was not intelligible, and if intelligible was\r\nnot true. And yet, when she had gone away to think over what had\r\npassed, she had been happy and satisfied, and almost triumphant. She\r\nhad never yet asked herself whether she expected anything further\r\nfrom Dr. Crofts, nor what that something further might be,--and yet\r\nshe was happy!\r\n\r\nLily had now become pert and saucy in her bed, taking upon herself\r\nthe little airs which are allowed to a convalescent invalid as\r\ncompensation for previous suffering and restraint. She pretended to\r\nmuch anxiety on the subject of her dinner, and declared that she\r\nwould go out on such or such a day, let Dr. Crofts be as imperious\r\nas he might. "He\'s an old savage, after all," she said to her sister,\r\none evening, after he was gone, "and just as bad as the rest of\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"I do not know who the rest of them are," said Bell, "but at any rate\r\nhe\'s not very old."\r\n\r\n"You know what I mean. He\'s just as grumpy as Dr. Gruffen, and thinks\r\neverybody is to do what he tells them. Of course, you take his part."\r\n\r\n"And of course you ought, seeing how good he has been."\r\n\r\n"And of course I should, to anybody but you. I do like to abuse him\r\nto you."\r\n\r\n"Lily, Lily!"\r\n\r\n"So I do. It\'s so hard to knock any fire out of you, that when one\r\ndoes find the place where the flint lies, one can\'t help hammering at\r\nit. What did he mean by saying that I shouldn\'t get up on Sunday? Of\r\ncourse I shall get up if I like it."\r\n\r\n"Not if mamma asks you not?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, but she won\'t, unless he interferes and dictates to her. Oh,\r\nBell, what a tyrant he would be if he were married!"\r\n\r\n"Would he?"\r\n\r\n"And how submissive you would be, if you were his wife! It\'s a\r\nthousand pities that you are not in love with each other;--that is,\r\nif you are not."\r\n\r\n"Lily, I thought that there was a promise between us about that."\r\n\r\n"Ah! but that was in other days. Things are all altered since that\r\npromise was given,--all the world has been altered." And as she said\r\nthis the tone of her voice was changed, and it had become almost sad.\r\n"I feel as though I ought to be allowed now to speak about anything I\r\nplease."\r\n\r\n"You shall, if it pleases you, my pet."\r\n\r\n"You see how it is, Bell; I can never again have anything of my own\r\nto talk about."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my darling, do not say that."\r\n\r\n"But it is so, Bell; and why not say it? Do you think I never\r\nsay it to myself in the hours when I am all alone, thinking over\r\nit--thinking, thinking, thinking. You must not,--you must not grudge\r\nto let me talk of it sometimes."\r\n\r\n"I will not grudge you anything;--only I cannot believe that it must\r\nbe so always."\r\n\r\n"Ask yourself, Bell, how it would be with you. But I sometimes fancy\r\nthat you measure me differently from yourself."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I do, for I know how much better you are."\r\n\r\n"I am not so much better as to be ever able to forget all that. I\r\nknow I never shall do so. I have made up my mind about it clearly and\r\nwith an absolute certainty."\r\n\r\n"Lily, Lily, Lily! pray do not say so."\r\n\r\n"But I do say it. And yet I have not been very mopish and melancholy;\r\nhave I, Bell? I do think I deserve some little credit, and yet, I\r\ndeclare, you won\'t allow me the least privilege in the world."\r\n\r\n"What privilege would you wish me to give you?"\r\n\r\n"To talk about Dr. Crofts."\r\n\r\n"Lily, you are a wicked, wicked tyrant." And Bell leaned over her,\r\nand fell upon her, and kissed her, hiding her own face in the gloom\r\nof the evening. After that it came to be an accepted understanding\r\nbetween them that Bell was not altogether indifferent to Dr. Crofts.\r\n\r\n"You heard what he said, my darling," Mrs. Dale said the next day,\r\nas the three were in the room together after Dr. Crofts was gone.\r\nMrs. Dale was standing on one side of the bed, and Bell on the other,\r\nwhile Lily was scolding them both. "You can get up for an hour or two\r\nto-morrow, but he thinks you had better not go out of the room."\r\n\r\n"What would be the good of that, mamma? I am so tired of looking\r\nalways at the same paper. It is such a tiresome paper. It makes one\r\ncount the pattern over and over again. I wonder how you ever can live\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got used to it, you see."\r\n\r\n"I never can get used to that sort of thing; but go on counting, and\r\ncounting, and counting. I\'ll tell you what I should like; and I\'m\r\nsure it would be the best thing, too."\r\n\r\n"And what would you like?" said Bell.\r\n\r\n"Just to get up at nine o\'clock to-morrow, and go to church as though\r\nnothing had happened. Then, when Dr. Crofts came in the evening, you\r\nwould tell him I was down at the school."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t quite advise that," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"It would give him such a delightful start. And when he found I\r\ndidn\'t die immediately, as of course I ought to do according to rule,\r\nhe would be so disgusted."\r\n\r\n"It would be very ungrateful, to say the least of it," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"No, it wouldn\'t, a bit. He needn\'t come, unless he likes it. And I\r\ndon\'t believe he comes to see me at all. It\'s all very well, mamma,\r\nyour looking in that way; but I\'m sure it\'s true. And I\'ll tell you\r\nwhat I\'ll do, I\'ll pretend to be bad again, otherwise the poor man\r\nwill be robbed of his only happiness."\r\n\r\n"I suppose we must allow her to say what she likes till she gets\r\nwell," said Mrs. Dale, laughing. It was now nearly dark, and Mrs.\r\nDale did not see that Bell\'s hand had crept under the bed-clothes,\r\nand taken hold of that of her sister. "It\'s true, mamma," continued\r\nLily, "and I defy her to deny it. I would forgive him for keeping me\r\nin bed if he would only make her fall in love with him."\r\n\r\n"She has made a bargain, mamma," said Bell, "that she is to say\r\nwhatever she likes till she gets well."\r\n\r\n"I am to say whatever I like always; that was the bargain, and I mean\r\nto stand to it."\r\n\r\nOn the following Sunday Lily did get up, but did not leave her\r\nmother\'s bedroom. There she was, seated in that half-dignified and\r\nhalf-luxurious state which belongs to the first getting up of an\r\ninvalid, when Dr. Crofts called. There she had eaten her tiny bit\r\nof roast mutton, and had called her mother a stingy old creature,\r\nbecause she would not permit another morsel; and there she had drunk\r\nher half glass of port wine, pretending that it was very bad, and\r\ntwice worse than the doctor\'s physic; and there, Sunday though it\r\nwas, she had fully enjoyed the last hour of daylight, reading that\r\nexquisite new novel which had just completed itself, amidst the\r\njarring criticisms of the youth and age of the reading public.\r\n\r\n"I am quite sure she was right in accepting him, Bell," she said,\r\nputting down the book as the light was fading, and beginning to\r\npraise the story.\r\n\r\n"It was a matter of course," said Bell. "It always is right in the\r\nnovels. That\'s why I don\'t like them. They are too sweet."\r\n\r\n"That\'s why I do like them, because they are so sweet. A sermon is\r\nnot to tell you what you are, but what you ought to be, and a novel\r\nshould tell you not what you are to get, but what you\'d like to get."\r\n\r\n"If so, then, I\'d go back to the old school, and have the heroine\r\nreally a heroine, walking all the way up from Edinburgh to London,\r\nand falling among thieves; or else nursing a wounded hero, and\r\ndescribing the battle from the window. We\'ve got tired of that; or\r\nelse the people who write can\'t do it now-a-days. But if we are to\r\nhave real life, let it be real."\r\n\r\n"No, Bell, no!" said Lily. "Real life sometimes is so painful." Then\r\nher sister, in a moment, was down on the floor at her feet, kissing\r\nher hand and caressing her knees, and praying that the wound might be\r\nhealed.\r\n\r\nOn that morning Lily had succeeded in inducing her sister to tell\r\nher all that had been said by Dr. Crofts. All that had been said by\r\nherself also, Bell had intended to tell; but when she came to this\r\npart of the story, her account was very lame. "I don\'t think I said\r\nanything," she said. "But silence always gives consent. He\'ll know\r\nthat," Lily had rejoined. "No, he will not; my silence didn\'t give\r\nany consent; I\'m sure of that. And he didn\'t think that it did." "But\r\nyou didn\'t mean to refuse him?" "I think I did. I don\'t think I knew\r\nwhat I meant; and it was safer, therefore, to look no, than to look\r\nyes. If I didn\'t say it, I\'m sure I looked it." "But you wouldn\'t\r\nrefuse him now?" asked Lily. "I don\'t know," said Bell. "It seems as\r\nthough I should want years to make up my mind; and he won\'t ask me\r\nagain."\r\n\r\nBell was still at her sister\'s feet, caressing them, and praying with\r\nall her heart that that wound might be healed in due time, when Mrs.\r\nDale came in and announced the doctor\'s daily visit. "Then I\'ll go,"\r\nsaid Bell.\r\n\r\n"Indeed you won\'t," said Lily. "He\'s coming simply to make a morning\r\ncall, and nobody need run away. Now, Dr. Crofts, you need not come\r\nand stand over me with your watch, for I won\'t let you touch my hand\r\nexcept to shake hands with me;" and then she held her hand out to\r\nhim. "And all you\'ll know of my tongue you\'ll learn from the sound."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care in the least for your tongue."\r\n\r\n"I dare say not, and yet you may some of these days. I can speak out,\r\nif I like it; can\'t I, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"I should think Dr. Crofts knows that by this time, my dear."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. There are some things gentlemen are very slow\r\nto learn. But you must sit down, Dr. Crofts, and make yourself\r\ncomfortable and polite; for you must understand that you are not\r\nmaster here any longer. I am out of bed now, and your reign is over."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the gratitude of the world, all through," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"Who is ever grateful to a doctor? He only cures you that he may\r\ntriumph over some other doctor, and declare, as he goes by Dr.\r\nGruffen\'s door, \'There, had she called you in, she\'d have been dead\r\nbefore now; or else would have been ill for twelve months.\' Don\'t you\r\njump for joy when Dr. Gruffen\'s patients die?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do--out in the market-place, so that everybody shall see\r\nme," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Lily, how can you say such shocking things?" said her sister.\r\n\r\nThen the doctor did sit down, and they were all very cosy together\r\nover the fire, talking about things which were not medical, or\r\nonly half medical in their appliance. By degrees the conversation\r\ncame round to Mrs. Eames and to John Eames. Two or three days\r\nsince, Crofts had told Mrs. Dale of that affair at the railway\r\nstation, of which up to that time she had heard nothing. Mrs.\r\nDale, when she was assured that young Eames had given Crosbie a\r\ntremendous thrashing--the tidings of the affair which had got\r\nthemselves substantiated at Guestwick so described the nature of the\r\nencounter--could not withhold some meed of applause.\r\n\r\n"Dear boy!" she said, almost involuntarily. "Dear boy! it came from\r\nthe honestness of his heart!" And then she gave special injunctions\r\nto the doctor--injunctions which were surely unnecessary--that no\r\nword of the matter should be whispered before Lily.\r\n\r\n"I was at the manor, yesterday," said the doctor, "and the earl would\r\ntalk about nothing but Master Johnny. He says he\'s the finest fellow\r\ngoing." Whereupon Mrs. Dale touched him with her foot, fearing that\r\nthe conversation might be led away in the direction of Johnny\'s\r\nprowess.\r\n\r\n"I am so glad," said Lily. "I always knew that they\'d find John out\r\nat last."\r\n\r\n"And Lady Julia is just as fond of him," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" said Lily. "Suppose they were to make up a match!"\r\n\r\n"Lily, how can you be so absurd?"\r\n\r\n"Let me see; what relation would he be to us? He would certainly\r\nbe Bernard\'s uncle, and uncle Christopher\'s half brother-in-law.\r\nWouldn\'t it be odd?"\r\n\r\n"It would rather," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"I hope he\'ll be civil to Bernard. Don\'t you, Bell? Is he to give up\r\nthe Income-tax Office, Dr. Crofts?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t hear that that was settled yet." And so they went on\r\ntalking about John Eames.\r\n\r\n"Joking apart," said Lily, "I am very glad that Lord De Guest has\r\ntaken him by the hand. Not that I think an earl is better than\r\nanybody else, but because it shows that people are beginning to\r\nunderstand that he has got something in him. I always said that they\r\nwho laughed at John would see him hold up his head yet." All which\r\nwords sank deep into Mrs. Dale\'s mind. If only, in some coming time,\r\nher pet might be taught to love this new young hero! But then would\r\nnot that last heroic deed of his militate most strongly against any\r\npossibility of such love!\r\n\r\n"And now I may as well be going," said the doctor, rising from his\r\nchair. At this time Bell had left the room, but Mrs. Dale was still\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n"You need not be in such a hurry, especially this evening," said\r\nLily.\r\n\r\n"Why especially this evening?"\r\n\r\n"Because it will be the last. Sit down again, Dr. Crofts. I\'ve got a\r\nlittle speech to make to you. I\'ve been preparing it all the morning,\r\nand you must give me an opportunity of speaking it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come the day after to-morrow, and I\'ll hear it then."\r\n\r\n"But I choose, sir, that you should hear it now. Am I not to be\r\nobeyed when I first get up on to my own throne? Dear, dear Dr.\r\nCrofts, how am I to thank you for all that you have done?"\r\n\r\n"How are any of us to thank him?" said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"I hate thanks," said the doctor. "One kind glance of the eye is\r\nworth them all, and I\'ve had many such in this house."\r\n\r\n"You have our hearts\' love, at any rate," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"God bless you all!" said he, as he prepared to go.\r\n\r\n"But I haven\'t made my speech yet," said Lily. "And to tell the\r\ntruth, mamma, you must go away, or I shall never be able to make it.\r\nIt\'s very improper, is it not, turning you out, but it shall only\r\ntake three minutes." Then Mrs. Dale, with some little joking word,\r\nleft the room; but, as she left it, her mind was hardly at ease.\r\nOught she to have gone, leaving it to Lily\'s discretion to say what\r\nwords she might think fit to Dr. Crofts? Hitherto she had never\r\ndoubted her daughters--not even their discretion; and therefore it\r\nhad been natural to her to go when she was bidden. But as she went\r\ndownstairs she had her doubts whether she was right or no.\r\n\r\n"Dr. Crofts," said Lily, as soon as they were alone. "Sit down there,\r\nclose to me. I want to ask you a question. What was it you said to\r\nBell when you were alone with her the other evening in the parlour?"\r\n\r\nThe doctor sat for a moment without answering, and Lily, who was\r\nwatching him closely, could see by the light of the fire that he had\r\nbeen startled--had almost shuddered as the question was asked him.\r\n\r\n"What did I say to her?" and he repeated her words in a very low\r\nvoice. "I asked her if she could love me, and be my wife."\r\n\r\n"And what answer did she make to you?"\r\n\r\n"What answer did she make? She simply refused me."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no; don\'t believe her, Dr. Crofts. It was not so;--I think\r\nit was not so. Mind you, I can say nothing as coming from her. She\r\nhas not told me her own mind. But if you really love her, she will be\r\nmad to refuse you."\r\n\r\n"I do love her, Lily; that at any rate is true."\r\n\r\n"Then go to her again. I am speaking for myself now. I cannot afford\r\nto lose such a brother as you would be. I love you so dearly that I\r\ncannot spare you. And she,--I think she\'ll learn to love you as you\r\nwould wish to be loved. You know her nature, how silent she is, and\r\naverse to talk about herself. She has confessed nothing to me but\r\nthis,--that you spoke to her and took her by surprise. Are we to have\r\nanother chance? I know how wrong I am to ask such a question. But,\r\nafter all, is not the truth the best?"\r\n\r\n"Another chance!"\r\n\r\n"I know what you mean, and I think she is worthy to be your wife. I\r\ndo, indeed; and if so, she must be very worthy. You won\'t tell of me,\r\nwill you now, doctor?"\r\n\r\n"No; I won\'t tell of you."\r\n\r\n"And you\'ll try again?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I\'ll try again."\r\n\r\n"God bless you, my brother! I hope,--I hope you\'ll be my brother."\r\nThen, as he put out his hand to her once more, she raised her head\r\ntowards him, and he, stooping down, kissed her forehead. "Make mamma\r\ncome to me," were the last words she spoke as he went out at the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"So you\'ve made your speech," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma."\r\n\r\n"I hope it was a discreet speech."\r\n\r\n"I hope it was, mamma. But it has made me so tired, and I believe\r\nI\'ll go to bed. Do you know I don\'t think I should have done much\r\ngood down at the school to-day?"\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Dale, in her anxiety to repair what injury might have been\r\ndone to her daughter by over-exertion, omitted any further mention of\r\nthe farewell speech.\r\n\r\nDr. Crofts as he rode home enjoyed but little of the triumph of a\r\nsuccessful lover. "It may be that she\'s right," he said to himself;\r\n"and, at any rate, I\'ll ask again." Nevertheless, that "No" which\r\nBell had spoken, and had repeated, still sounded in his ears harsh\r\nand conclusive. There are men to whom a peal of noes rattling about\r\ntheir ears never takes the sound of a true denial, and others to whom\r\nthe word once pronounced, be it whispered ever so softly, comes as\r\nthough it were an unchangeable verdict from the supreme\r\njudgment-seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nFIE, FIE!\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: (untitled)]\r\n\r\nWill any reader remember the loves,--no, not the loves; that word\r\nis so decidedly ill-applied as to be incapable of awakening the\r\nremembrance of any reader; but the flirtations--of Lady Dumbello and\r\nMr. Plantagenet Palliser? Those flirtations, as they had been carried\r\non at Courcy Castle, were laid bare in all their enormities to the\r\neye of the public, and it must be confessed that if the eye of the\r\npublic was shocked, that eye must be shocked very easily.\r\n\r\nBut the eye of the public was shocked, and people who were particular\r\nas to their morals said very strange things. Lady De Courcy herself\r\nsaid very strange things indeed, shaking her head, and dropping\r\nmysterious words; whereas Lady Clandidlem spoke much more openly,\r\ndeclaring her opinion that Lady Dumbello would be off before May.\r\nThey both agreed that it would not be altogether bad for Lord\r\nDumbello that he should lose his wife, but shook their heads very\r\nsadly when they spoke of poor Plantagenet Palliser. As to the lady\'s\r\nfate, that lady whom they had both almost worshipped during the days\r\nat Courcy Castle,--they did not seem to trouble themselves about\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nAnd it must be admitted that Mr. Palliser had been a little\r\nimprudent,--imprudent, that is, if he knew anything about the rumours\r\nafloat,--seeing that soon after his visit at Courcy Castle he had\r\ngone down to Lady Hartletop\'s place in Shropshire, at which the\r\nDumbellos intended to spend the winter, and on leaving it had\r\nexpressed his intention of returning in February. The Hartletop\r\npeople had pressed him very much,--the pressure having come with\r\npeculiar force from Lord Dumbello. Therefore it is reasonable to\r\nsuppose that the Hartletop people had at any rate not heard of the\r\nrumour.\r\n\r\nMr. Plantagenet Palliser spent his Christmas with his uncle, the Duke\r\nof Omnium, at Gatherum Castle. That is to say, he reached the castle\r\nin time for dinner on Christmas eve, and left it on the morning after\r\nChristmas day. This was in accordance with the usual practice of\r\nhis life, and the tenants, dependants, and followers of the Omnium\r\ninterest were always delighted to see this manifestation of a healthy\r\nEnglish domestic family feeling between the duke and his nephew.\r\nBut the amount of intercourse on such occasions between them was\r\ngenerally trifling. The duke would smile as he put out his right hand\r\nto his nephew, and say,--\r\n\r\n"Well, Plantagenet,--very busy, I suppose?"\r\n\r\nThe duke was the only living being who called him Plantagenet to his\r\nface, though there were some scores of men who talked of Planty Pal\r\nbehind his back. The duke had been the only living being so to call\r\nhim. Let us hope that it still was so, and that there had arisen\r\nno feminine exception, dangerous in its nature and improper in its\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n"Well, Plantagenet," said the duke, on the present occasion, "very\r\nbusy, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, duke," said Mr. Palliser. "When a man gets the harness\r\non him he does not easily get quit of it."\r\n\r\nThe duke remembered that his nephew had made almost the same remark\r\nat his last Christmas visit.\r\n\r\n"By-the-by," said the duke, "I want to say a word or two to you\r\nbefore you go."\r\n\r\nSuch a proposition on the duke\'s part was a great departure from\r\nhis usual practice, but the nephew of course undertook to obey his\r\nuncle\'s behests.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see you before dinner to-morrow," said Plantagenet.\r\n\r\n"Ah, do," said the duke. "I\'ll not keep you five minutes." And at six\r\no\'clock on the following afternoon the two were closeted together in\r\nthe duke\'s private room.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose there is much in it," began the duke, "but people\r\nare talking about you and Lady Dumbello."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, people are very kind." And Mr. Palliser bethought\r\nhimself of the fact,--for it certainly was a fact,--that people for\r\na great many years had talked about his uncle and Lady Dumbello\'s\r\nmother-in-law.\r\n\r\n"Yes; kind enough; are they not? You\'ve just come from Hartlebury,\r\nI believe." Hartlebury was the Marquis of Hartletop\'s seat in\r\nShropshire.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have. And I\'m going there again in February."\r\n\r\n"Ah, I\'m sorry for that. Not that I mean, of course, to interfere\r\nwith your arrangements. You will acknowledge that I have not often\r\ndone so, in any matter whatever."\r\n\r\n"No; you have not," said the nephew, comforting himself with an\r\ninward assurance that no such interference on his uncle\'s part could\r\nhave been possible.\r\n\r\n"But in this instance it would suit me, and I really think it would\r\nsuit you too, that you should be as little at Hartlebury as possible.\r\nYou have said you would go there, and of course you will go. But if I\r\nwere you, I would not stay above a day or two."\r\n\r\nMr. Plantagenet Palliser received everything he had in the world from\r\nhis uncle. He sat in Parliament through his uncle\'s interest, and\r\nreceived an allowance of ever so many thousand a year which his uncle\r\ncould stop to-morrow by his mere word. He was his uncle\'s heir, and\r\nthe dukedom, with certain entailed properties, must ultimately fall\r\nto him, unless his uncle should marry and have a son. But by far the\r\ngreater portion of the duke\'s property was unentailed; the duke might\r\nprobably live for the next twenty years or more; and it was quite\r\npossible that, if offended, he might marry and become a father. It\r\nmay be said that no man could well be more dependent on another than\r\nPlantagenet Palliser was upon his uncle; and it may be said also that\r\nno father or uncle ever troubled his heir with less interference.\r\nNevertheless, the nephew immediately felt himself aggrieved by this\r\nallusion to his private life, and resolved at once that he would not\r\nsubmit to such surveillance.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how long I shall stay," said he; "but I cannot say that\r\nmy visit will be influenced one way or the other by such a rumour as\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"No; probably not. But it may perhaps be influenced by my request."\r\nAnd the duke, as he spoke, looked a little savage.\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t ask me to regard a report that has no foundation."\r\n\r\n"I am not asking about its foundation. Nor do I in the least wish to\r\ninterfere with your manner in life." By which last observation the\r\nduke intended his nephew to understand that he was quite at liberty\r\nto take away any other gentleman\'s wife, but that he was not at\r\nliberty to give occasion even for a surmise that he wanted to take\r\nLord Dumbello\'s wife. "The fact is this, Plantagenet. I have for many\r\nyears been intimate with that family. I have not many intimacies, and\r\nshall probably never increase them. Such friends as I have, I wish\r\nto keep, and you will easily perceive that any such report as that\r\nwhich I have mentioned, might make it unpleasant for me to go to\r\nHartlebury, or for the Hartlebury people to come here." The duke\r\ncertainly could not have spoken plainer, and Mr. Palliser understood\r\nhim thoroughly. Two such alliances between the two families could not\r\nbe expected to run pleasantly together, and even the rumour of any\r\nsuch second alliance might interfere with the pleasantness of the\r\nformer one.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all," said the duke.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a most absurd slander," said Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"I dare say. Those slanders always are absurd; but what can we do?\r\nWe can\'t tie up people\'s tongues." And the duke looked as though he\r\nwished to have the subject considered as finished, and to be left\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n"But we can disregard them," said the nephew, indiscreetly.\r\n\r\n"You may. I have never been able to do so. And yet, I believe, I\r\nhave not earned for myself the reputation of being subject to the\r\nvoices of men. You think that I am asking much of you; but you should\r\nremember that hitherto I have given much and have asked nothing. I\r\nexpect you to oblige me in this matter."\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Plantagenet Palliser left the room, knowing that he had been\r\nthreatened. What the duke had said amounted to this.--If you go on\r\ndangling after Lady Dumbello, I\'ll stop the seven thousand a year\r\nwhich I give you. I\'ll oppose your next return at Silverbridge, and\r\nI\'ll make a will and leave away from you Matching and The Horns,--a\r\nbeautiful little place in Surrey, the use of which had been already\r\noffered to Mr. Palliser in the event of his marriage; all the\r\nLittlebury estate in Yorkshire, and the enormous Scotch property. Of\r\nmy personal goods, and money invested in loans, shares, and funds,\r\nyou shall never touch a shilling, or the value of a shilling. And, if\r\nI find that I can suit myself, it may be that I\'ll leave you plain\r\nMr. Plantagenet Palliser, with a little first cousin for the head of\r\nyour family.\r\n\r\nThe full amount of this threat Mr. Palliser understood, and, as he\r\nthought of it, he acknowledged to himself that he had never felt for\r\nLady Dumbello anything like love. No conversation between them had\r\never been warmer than that of which the reader has seen a sample.\r\nLady Dumbello had been nothing to him. But now,--now that the matter\r\nhad been put before him in this way, might it not become him, as a\r\ngentleman, to fall in love with so very beautiful a woman, whose name\r\nhad already been linked with his own? We all know that story of the\r\npriest, who, by his question in the confessional, taught the ostler\r\nto grease the horses\' teeth. "I never did yet," said the ostler, "but\r\nI\'ll have a try at it." In this case, the duke had acted the part of\r\nthe priest, and Mr. Palliser, before the night was over, had almost\r\nbecome as ready a pupil as the ostler. As to the threat, it would ill\r\nbecome him, as a Palliser and a Plantagenet, to regard it. The duke\r\nwould not marry. Of all men in the world he was the least likely to\r\nspite his own face by cutting off his own nose; and, for the rest of\r\nit, Mr. Palliser would take his chance. Therefore he went down to\r\nHartlebury early in February, having fully determined to be very\r\nparticular in his attentions to Lady Dumbello.\r\n\r\nAmong a houseful of people at Hartlebury, he found Lord Porlock, a\r\nslight, sickly, worn-out looking man, who had something about his eye\r\nof his father\'s hardness, but nothing in his mouth of his father\'s\r\nferocity.\r\n\r\n"So your sister is going to be married?" said Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\n"Yes. One has no right to be surprised at anything they do, when one\r\nremembers the life their father leads them."\r\n\r\n"I was going to congratulate you."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t do that."\r\n\r\n"I met him at Courcy, and rather liked him."\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser had barely spoken to Mr. Crosbie at Courcy, but then in\r\nthe usual course of his social life he seldom did more than barely\r\nspeak to anybody.\r\n\r\n"Did you?" said Lord Porlock. "For the poor girl\'s sake I hope he\'s\r\nnot a ruffian. How any man should propose to my father to marry a\r\ndaughter out of his house, is more than I can understand. How was my\r\nmother looking?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t see anything amiss about her."\r\n\r\n"I expect that he\'ll murder her some day." Then that conversation\r\ncame to an end.\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser himself perceived--as he looked at her he could not but\r\nperceive--that a certain amount of social energy seemed to enliven\r\nLady Dumbello when he approached her. She was given to smile when\r\naddressed, but her usual smile was meaningless, almost leaden, and\r\nnever in any degree flattering to the person to whom it was accorded.\r\nVery many women smile as they answer the words which are spoken to\r\nthem, and most who do so flatter by their smile. The thing is so\r\ncommon that no one thinks of it. The flattering pleases, but means\r\nnothing. The impression unconsciously taken simply conveys a feeling\r\nthat the woman has made herself agreeable, as it was her duty to\r\ndo,--agreeable, as far as that smile went, in some very infinitesimal\r\ndegree. But she has thereby made her little contribution to society.\r\nShe will make the same contribution a hundred times in the same\r\nevening. No one knows that she has flattered anybody; she does not\r\nknow it herself; and the world calls her an agreeable woman. But Lady\r\nDumbello put no flattery into her customary smiles. They were cold,\r\nunmeaning, accompanied by no special glance of the eye, and seldom\r\naddressed to the individual. They were given to the room at large;\r\nand the room at large, acknowledging her great pretensions, accepted\r\nthem as sufficient. But when Mr. Palliser came near to her she would\r\nturn herself slightly, ever so slightly, on her seat, and would allow\r\nher eyes to rest for a moment upon his face. Then when he remarked\r\nthat it had been rather cold, she would smile actually upon him as\r\nshe acknowledged the truth of his observation. All this Mr. Palliser\r\ntaught himself to observe, having been instructed by his foolish\r\nuncle in that lesson as to the greasing of the horses\' teeth.\r\n\r\nBut, nevertheless, during the first week of his stay at Hartlebury,\r\nhe did not say a word to her more tender than his observation about\r\nthe weather. It is true that he was very busy. He had undertaken to\r\nspeak upon the address, and as Parliament was now about to be opened,\r\nand as his speech was to be based upon statistics, he was full of\r\nfigures and papers. His correspondence was pressing, and the day was\r\nseldom long enough for his purposes. He felt that the intimacy to\r\nwhich he aspired was hindered by the laborious routine of his life;\r\nbut nevertheless he would do something before he left Hartlebury, to\r\nshow the special nature of his regard. He would say something to her,\r\nthat should open to her view the secret of--shall we say his heart?\r\nSuch was his resolve, day after day. And yet day after day went by,\r\nand nothing was said. He fancied that Lord Dumbello was somewhat less\r\nfriendly in his manner than he had been, that he put himself in the\r\nway and looked cross; but, as he declared to himself, he cared very\r\nlittle for Lord Dumbello\'s looks.\r\n\r\n"When do you go to town?" he said to her one evening.\r\n\r\n"Probably in April. We certainly shall not leave Hartlebury before\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes. You stay for the hunting."\r\n\r\n"Yes; Lord Dumbello always remains here through March. He may run up\r\nto town for a day or two."\r\n\r\n"How comfortable! I must be in London on Thursday, you know."\r\n\r\n"When Parliament meets, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly. It is such a bore; but one has to do it."\r\n\r\n"When a man makes a business of it, I suppose he must."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, yes; it\'s quite imperative." Then Mr. Palliser looked\r\nround the room, and thought he saw Lord Dumbello\'s eye fixed upon\r\nhim. It was really very hard work. If the truth must be told, he\r\ndid not know how to begin. What was he to say to her? How was he to\r\ncommence a conversation that should end by being tender? She was very\r\nhandsome certainly, and for him she could look interesting; but for\r\nhis very life he did not know how to begin to say anything special\r\nto her. A liaison with such a woman as Lady Dumbello,--platonic,\r\ninnocent, but nevertheless very intimate,--would certainly lend\r\na grace to his life, which, under its present circumstances, was\r\nrather dry. He was told,--told by public rumour which had reached\r\nhim through his uncle,--that the lady was willing. She certainly\r\nlooked as though she liked him; but how was he to begin? The art of\r\nstartling the House of Commons and frightening the British public by\r\nthe voluminous accuracy of his statistics he had already learned; but\r\nwhat was he to say to a pretty woman?\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be sure to be in London in April?"\r\n\r\nThis was on another occasion.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I think so."\r\n\r\n"In Carlton Gardens, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Yes; Lord Dumbello has got a lease of the house now."\r\n\r\n"Has he, indeed? Ah, it\'s an excellent house. I hope I shall be\r\nallowed to call there sometimes."\r\n\r\n"Certainly,--only I know you must be so busy."\r\n\r\n"Not on Saturdays and Sundays."\r\n\r\n"I always receive on Sundays," said Lady Dumbello. Mr. Palliser felt\r\nthat there was nothing peculiarly gracious in this. A permission to\r\ncall when all her other acquaintances would be there, was not much;\r\nbut still, perhaps, it was as much as he could expect to obtain on\r\nthat occasion. He looked up and saw that Lord Dumbello\'s eyes were\r\nagain upon him, and that Lord Dumbello\'s brow was black. He began\r\nto doubt whether a country house, where all the people were thrown\r\ntogether, was the best place in the world for such manoeuvring.\r\nLady Dumbello was very handsome, and he liked to look at her, but\r\nhe could not find any subject on which to interest her in that\r\ndrawing-room at Hartlebury. Later in the evening he found himself\r\nsaying something to her about the sugar duties, and then he knew that\r\nhe had better give it up. He had only one day more, and that was\r\nrequired imperatively for his speech. The matter would go much\r\neasier in London, and he would postpone it till then. In the crowded\r\nrooms of London private conversation would be much easier, and Lord\r\nDumbello wouldn\'t stand over and look at him. Lady Dumbello had\r\ntaken his remarks about the sugar very kindly, and had asked for a\r\ndefinition of an ad valorem duty. It was a nearer approach to a real\r\nconversation than he had ever before made; but the subject had been\r\nunlucky, and could not, in his hands, be brought round to anything\r\ntender; so he resolved to postpone his gallantry till the London\r\nspring should make it easy, and felt as he did so, that he was\r\nrelieved for the time from a heavy weight.\r\n\r\n"Good-by, Lady Dumbello," he said, on the next evening. "I start\r\nearly to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\n"Good-by, Mr. Palliser."\r\n\r\nAs she spoke she smiled ever so sweetly, but she certainly had not\r\nlearned to call him Plantagenet as yet. He went up to London and\r\nimmediately got himself to work. The accurate and voluminous speech\r\ncame off with considerable credit to himself,--credit of that\r\nquiet, enduring kind which is accorded to such men. The speech was\r\nrespectable, dull, and correct. Men listened to it, or sat with\r\ntheir hats over their eyes, asleep, pretending to do so; and the\r\nDaily Jupiter in the morning had a leading article about it, which,\r\nhowever, left the reader at its close altogether in doubt whether\r\nMr. Palliser might be supposed to be a great financial pundit or no.\r\nMr. Palliser might become a shining light to the moneyed world, and\r\na glory to the banking interests; he might be a future Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer. But then again, it might turn out that, in these\r\naffairs, he was a mere ignis fatuus, a blind guide,--a man to be laid\r\naside as very respectable, but of no depth. Who, then, at the present\r\ntime, could judiciously risk his credit by declaring whether Mr.\r\nPalliser understood his subject or did not understand it? We are not\r\ncontent in looking to our newspapers for all the information that\r\nearth and human intellect can afford; but we demand from them what\r\nwe might demand if a daily sheet could come to us from the world of\r\nspirits. The result, of course, is this,--that the papers do pretend\r\nthat they have come daily from the world of spirits; but the oracles\r\nare very doubtful, as were those of old.\r\n\r\nPlantagenet Palliser, though he was contented with this article,\r\nfelt, as he sat in his chambers in the Albany, that something else\r\nwas wanting to his happiness. This sort of life was all very well.\r\nAmbition was a grand thing, and it became him, as a Palliser and a\r\nfuture peer, to make politics his profession. But might he not spare\r\nan hour or two for Amaryllis in the shade? Was it not hard, this life\r\nof his? Since he had been told that Lady Dumbello smiled upon him, he\r\nhad certainly thought more about her smiles than had been good for\r\nhis statistics. It seemed as though a new vein in his body had been\r\nbrought into use, and that blood was running where blood had never\r\nrun before. If he had seen Lady Dumbello before Dumbello had seen\r\nher, might he not have married her? Ah! in such case as that, had she\r\nbeen simply Miss Grantly, or Lady Griselda Grantly, as the case might\r\nhave been, he thought he might have been able to speak to her with\r\nmore ease. As it was, he certainly had found the task difficult, down\r\nin the country, though he had heard of men of his class doing the\r\nsame sort of thing all his life. For my own part, I believe that the\r\nreputed sinners are much more numerous than the sinners.\r\n\r\nAs he sat there, a certain Mr. Fothergill came in upon him. Mr.\r\nFothergill was a gentleman who managed most of his uncle\'s ordinary\r\naffairs,--a clever fellow, who knew on which side his bread was\r\nbuttered. Mr. Fothergill was naturally anxious to stand well with the\r\nheir; but to stand well with the owner was his business in life, and\r\nwith that business he never allowed anything to interfere. On this\r\noccasion Mr. Fothergill was very civil, complimenting his future\r\npossible patron on his very powerful speech, and predicting for him\r\npolitical power with much more certainty than the newspapers which\r\nhad, or had not, come from the world of spirits. Mr. Fothergill had\r\ncome in to say a word or two about some matter of business. As all\r\nMr. Palliser\'s money passed through Mr. Fothergill\'s hands, and as\r\nhis electioneering interests were managed by Mr. Fothergill, Mr.\r\nFothergill not unfrequently called to say a necessary word or two.\r\nWhen this was done he said another word or two, which might be\r\nnecessary or not, as the case might be.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Palliser," said he, "I wonder you don\'t think of marrying. I\r\nhope you\'ll excuse me."\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser was by no means sure that he would excuse him, and sat\r\nhimself suddenly upright in his chair in a manner that was intended\r\nto exhibit a first symptom of outraged dignity. But, singularly\r\nenough, he had himself been thinking of marriage at that moment.\r\nHow would it have been with him had he known the beautiful Griselda\r\nbefore the Dumbello alliance had been arranged? Would he have married\r\nher? Would he have been comfortable if he had married her? Of\r\ncourse he could not marry now, seeing that he was in love with Lady\r\nDumbello, and that the lady in question, unfortunately, had a husband\r\nof her own; but though he had been thinking of marrying, he did not\r\nlike to have the subject thus roughly thrust before his eyes, and,\r\nas it were, into his very lap by his uncle\'s agent. Mr. Fothergill,\r\nno doubt, saw the first symptom of outraged dignity, for he was a\r\nclever, sharp man. But, perhaps, he did not in truth much regard it.\r\nPerhaps he had received instructions which he was bound to regard\r\nabove all other matters.\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'ll excuse me, Mr. Palliser, I do, indeed; but I say it\r\nbecause I am half afraid of some,--some,--some diminution of good\r\nfeeling, perhaps, I had better call it, between you and your uncle.\r\nAnything of that kind would be such a monstrous pity."\r\n\r\n"I am not aware of any such probability."\r\n\r\nThis Mr. Palliser said with considerable dignity; but when the words\r\nwere spoken he bethought himself whether he had not told a fib.\r\n\r\n"No; perhaps not. I trust there is no such probability. But the duke\r\nis a very determined man if he takes anything into his head;--and\r\nthen he has so much in his power."\r\n\r\n"He has not me in his power, Mr. Fothergill."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no. One man does not have another in his power in this\r\ncountry,--not in that way; but then you know, Mr. Palliser, it would\r\nhardly do to offend him; would it?"\r\n\r\n"I would rather not offend him, as is natural. Indeed, I do not wish\r\nto offend any one."\r\n\r\n"Exactly so; and least of all the duke, who has the whole property in\r\nhis own hands. We may say the whole, for he can marry to-morrow if he\r\npleases. And then his life is so good. I don\'t know a stouter man of\r\nhis age, anywhere."\r\n\r\n"I\'m very glad to hear it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure you are, Mr. Palliser. But if he were to take offence, you\r\nknow?"\r\n\r\n"I should put up with it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, exactly; that\'s what you would do. But it would be worth while\r\nto avoid it, seeing how much he has in his power."\r\n\r\n"Has the duke sent you to me now, Mr. Fothergill?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, no,--nothing of the sort. But he dropped words the other day\r\nwhich made me fancy that he was not quite,--quite,--quite at ease\r\nabout you. I have long known that he would be very glad indeed to\r\nsee an heir born to the property. The other morning,--I don\'t know\r\nwhether there was anything in it,--but I fancied he was going to make\r\nsome change in the present arrangements. He did not do it, and it\r\nmight have been fancy. Only think, Mr. Palliser, what one word of\r\nhis might do! If he says a word, he never goes back from it." Then,\r\nhaving said so much, Mr. Fothergill went his way.\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser understood the meaning of all this very well. It\r\nwas not the first occasion on which Mr. Fothergill had given him\r\nadvice,--advice such as Mr. Fothergill himself had no right to give\r\nhim. He always received such counsel with an air of half-injured\r\ndignity, intending thereby to explain to Mr. Fothergill that he was\r\nintruding. But he knew well whence the advice came; and though, in\r\nall such cases, he had made up his mind not to follow such counsel,\r\nit had generally come to pass that Mr. Palliser\'s conduct had more or\r\nless accurately conformed itself to Mr. Fothergill\'s advice. A word\r\nfrom the duke might certainly do a great deal! Mr. Palliser resolved\r\nthat in that affair of Lady Dumbello he would follow his own devices.\r\nBut, nevertheless, it was undoubtedly true that a word from the duke\r\nmight do a great deal!\r\n\r\nWe, who are in the secret, know how far Mr. Palliser had already\r\nprogressed in his iniquitous passion before he left Hartlebury.\r\nOthers, who were perhaps not so well informed, gave him credit\r\nfor a much more advanced success. Lady Clandidlem, in her letter\r\nto Lady De Courcy, written immediately after the departure of Mr.\r\nPalliser, declared that, having heard of that gentleman\'s intended\r\nmatutinal departure, she had confidently expected to learn at the\r\nbreakfast-table that Lady Dumbello had flown with him. From the tone\r\nof her ladyship\'s language, it seemed as though she had been robbed\r\nof an anticipated pleasure by Lady Dumbello\'s prolonged sojourn\r\nin the halls of her husband\'s ancestors. "I feel, however, quite\r\nconvinced," said Lady Clandidlem, "that it cannot go on longer than\r\nthe spring. I never yet saw a man so infatuated as Mr. Palliser. He\r\ndid not leave her for one moment all the time he was here. No one\r\nbut Lady Hartletop would have permitted it. But, you know, there is\r\nnothing so pleasant as good old family friendships."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE\'S DAY AT ALLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nLily had exacted a promise from her mother before her illness,\r\nand during the period of her convalescence often referred to it,\r\nreminding her mother that that promise had been made, and must be\r\nkept. Lily was to be told the day on which Crosbie was to be married.\r\nIt had come to the knowledge of them all that the marriage was to\r\ntake place in February. But this was not sufficient for Lily. She\r\nmust know the day.\r\n\r\nAnd as the time drew nearer,--Lily becoming stronger the while, and\r\nless subject to medical authority,--the marriage of Crosbie and\r\nAlexandrina was spoken of much more frequently at the Small House.\r\nIt was not a subject which Mrs. Dale or Bell would have chosen for\r\nconversation; but Lily would refer to it. She would begin by doing so\r\nalmost in a drolling strain, alluding to herself as a forlorn damsel\r\nin a play-book; and then she would go on to speak of his interests as\r\na matter which was still of great moment to her. But in the course of\r\nsuch talking she would too often break down, showing by some sad word\r\nor melancholy tone how great was the burden on her heart. Mrs. Dale\r\nand Bell would willingly have avoided the subject, but Lily would not\r\nhave it avoided. For them it was a very difficult matter on which\r\nto speak in her hearing. It was not permitted to them to say a word\r\nof abuse against Crosbie, as to whom they thought that no word of\r\ncondemnation could be sufficiently severe; and they were forced to\r\nlisten to such excuses for his conduct as Lily chose to manufacture,\r\nnever daring to point out how vain those excuses were.\r\n\r\nIndeed, in those days Lily reigned as a queen at the Small House.\r\nIll-usage and illness together falling into her hands had given her\r\nsuch power, that none of the other women were able to withstand it.\r\nNothing was said about it; but it was understood by them all, Jane\r\nand the cook included, that Lily was for the time paramount. She was\r\na dear, gracious, loving, brave queen, and no one was anxious to\r\nrebel;--only that those praises of Crosbie were so very bitter in the\r\nears of her subjects. The day was named soon enough, and the tidings\r\ncame down to Allington. On the fourteenth of February, Crosbie was\r\nto be made a happy man. This was not known to the Dales till the\r\ntwelfth, and they would willingly have spared the knowledge then, had\r\nit been possible to spare it. But it was not so, and on that evening\r\nLily was told.\r\n\r\nDuring these days, Bell used to see her uncle daily. Her visits were\r\nmade with the pretence of taking to him information as to Lily\'s\r\nhealth; but there was perhaps at the bottom of them a feeling that,\r\nas the family intended to leave the Small House at the end of March,\r\nit would be well to let the squire know that there was no enmity in\r\ntheir hearts against him. Nothing more had been said about their\r\nmoving,--nothing, that is, from them to him. But the matter was going\r\non, and he knew it. Dr. Crofts was already in treaty on their behalf\r\nfor a small furnished house at Guestwick. The squire was very sad\r\nabout it,--very sad indeed. When Hopkins spoke to him on the subject,\r\nhe sharply desired that faithful gardener to hold his tongue, giving\r\nit to be understood that such things were not to be made matter\r\nof talk by the Allington dependants till they had been officially\r\nannounced. With Bell during these visits he never alluded to the\r\nmatter. She was the chief sinner, in that she had refused to marry\r\nher cousin, and had declined even to listen to rational counsel upon\r\nthe matter. But the squire felt that he could not discuss the subject\r\nwith her, seeing that he had been specially informed by Mrs. Dale\r\nthat his interference would not be permitted; and then he was perhaps\r\naware that if he did discuss the subject with Bell, he would not gain\r\nmuch by such discussion. Their conversation, therefore, generally\r\nfell upon Crosbie, and the tone in which he was mentioned in the\r\nGreat House was very different from that assumed in Lily\'s presence.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll be a wretched man," said the squire, when he told Bell of the\r\nday that had been fixed.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want him to be wretched," said Bell. "But I can hardly think\r\nthat he can act as he has done without being punished."\r\n\r\n"He will be a wretched man. He gets no fortune with her, and she will\r\nexpect everything that fortune can give. I believe, too, that she\r\nis older than he is. I cannot understand it. Upon my word, I cannot\r\nunderstand how a man can be such a knave and such a fool. Give my\r\nlove to Lily. I\'ll see her to-morrow or the next day. She\'s well rid\r\nof him; I\'m sure of that;--though I suppose it would not do to tell\r\nher so."\r\n\r\nThe morning of the fourteenth came upon them at the Small House,\r\nas comes the morning of those special days which have been long\r\nconsidered, and which are to be long remembered. It brought with it a\r\nhard, bitter frost,--a black, biting frost,--such a frost as breaks\r\nthe water-pipes, and binds the ground to the hardness of granite.\r\nLily, queen as she was, had not yet been allowed to go back to her\r\nown chamber, but occupied the larger bed in her mother\'s room, her\r\nmother sleeping on a smaller one.\r\n\r\n"Mamma," she said, "how cold they\'ll be!" Her mother had announced to\r\nher the fact of the black frost, and these were the first words she\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n"I fear their hearts will be cold also," said Mrs. Dale. She ought\r\nnot to have said so. She was transgressing the acknowledged rule\r\nof the house in saying any word that could be construed as being\r\ninimical to Crosbie or his bride. But her feeling on the matter was\r\ntoo strong, and she could not restrain herself.\r\n\r\n"Why should their hearts be cold? Oh, mamma, that is a terrible thing\r\nto say. Why should their hearts be cold?"\r\n\r\n"I hope it may not be so."\r\n\r\n"Of course you do; of course we all hope it. He was not cold-hearted,\r\nat any rate. A man is not cold-hearted, because he does not know\r\nhimself. Mamma, I want you to wish for their happiness."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale was silent for a minute or two before she answered this,\r\nbut then she did answer it. "I think I do," said she. "I think I do\r\nwish for it."\r\n\r\n"I am very sure that I do," said Lily.\r\n\r\nAt this time Lily had her breakfast upstairs, but went down into the\r\ndrawing-room in the course of the morning.\r\n\r\n"You must be very careful in wrapping yourself as you go downstairs,"\r\nsaid Bell, who stood by the tray on which she had brought up the\r\ntoast and tea. "The cold is what you would call awful."\r\n\r\n"I should call it jolly," said Lily, "if I could get up and go out.\r\nDo you remember lecturing me about talking slang the day that he\r\nfirst came?"\r\n\r\n"Did I, my pet?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you remember, when I called him a swell? Ah, dear! so he was.\r\nThat was the mistake, and it was all my own fault, as I had seen it\r\nfrom the first."\r\n\r\nBell for a moment turned her face away, and beat with her foot\r\nagainst the ground. Her anger was more difficult of restraint than\r\nwas even her mother\'s,--and now, not restraining it, but wishing to\r\nhide it, she gave it vent in this way.\r\n\r\n"I understand, Bell. I know what your foot means when it goes in that\r\nway; and you shan\'t do it. Come here, Bell, and let me teach you\r\nChristianity. I\'m a fine sort of teacher, am I not? And I did not\r\nquite mean that."\r\n\r\n"I wish I could learn it from some one," said Bell. "There are\r\ncircumstances in which what we call Christianity seems to me to be\r\nhardly possible."\r\n\r\n"When your foot goes in that way it is a very unchristian foot, and\r\nyou ought to keep it still. It means anger against him, because he\r\ndiscovered before it was too late that he would not be happy,--that\r\nis, that he and I would not be happy together if we were married."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t scrutinize my foot too closely, Lily."\r\n\r\n"But your foot must bear scrutiny, and your eyes, and your voice. He\r\nwas very foolish to fall in love with me. And so was I very foolish\r\nto let him love me, at a moment\'s notice,--without a thought as it\r\nwere. I was so proud of having him, that I gave myself up to him all\r\nat once, without giving him a chance of thinking of it. In a week or\r\ntwo it was done. Who could expect that such an engagement should be\r\nlasting?"\r\n\r\n"And why not? That is nonsense, Lily. But we will not talk about it."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but I want to talk about it. It was as I have said, and if\r\nso, you shouldn\'t hate him because he did the only thing which he\r\nhonestly could do when he found out his mistake."\r\n\r\n"What; become engaged again within a week!"\r\n\r\n"There had been a very old friendship, Bell; you must remember that.\r\nBut I was speaking of his conduct to me, and not of his conduct to--"\r\nAnd then she remembered that that other lady might at this very\r\nmoment possess the name which she had once been so proud to think\r\nthat she would bear herself. "Bell," she said, stopping her other\r\nspeech suddenly, "at what o\'clock do people get married in London?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, at all manner of hours,--any time before twelve. They will be\r\nfashionable, and will be married late."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think she\'s Mrs. Crosbie yet, then?"\r\n\r\n"Lady Alexandrina Crosbie," said Bell, shuddering.\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course; I forgot. I should so like to see her. I feel such\r\nan interest about her. I wonder what coloured hair she has. I suppose\r\nshe is a sort of Juno of a woman,--very tall and handsome. I\'m sure\r\nshe has not got a pug-nose like me. Do you know what I should really\r\nlike, only of course it\'s not possible;--to be godmother to his first\r\nchild."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lily!"\r\n\r\n"I should. Don\'t you hear me say that I know it\'s not possible? I\'m\r\nnot going up to London to ask her. She\'ll have all manner of grandees\r\nfor her godfathers and godmothers. I wonder what those grand people\r\nare really like."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think there\'s any difference. Look at Lady Julia."\r\n\r\n"Oh, she\'s not a grand person. It isn\'t merely having a title. Don\'t\r\nyou remember that he told us that Mr. Palliser is about the grandest\r\ngrandee of them all. I suppose people do learn to like them. He\r\nalways used to say that he had been so long among people of that\r\nsort, that it would be very difficult for him to divide himself off\r\nfrom them. I should never have done for that kind of thing; should\r\nI?"\r\n\r\n"There is nothing I despise so much as what you call that kind of\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n"Do you? I don\'t. After all, think how much work they do. He used to\r\ntell me of that. They have all the governing in their hands, and get\r\nvery little money for doing it."\r\n\r\n"Worse luck for the country."\r\n\r\n"The country seems to do pretty well. But you\'re a radical, Bell. My\r\nbelief is, you wouldn\'t be a lady if you could help it."\r\n\r\n"I\'d sooner be an honest woman."\r\n\r\n"And so you are,--my own dear, dearest, honest Bell,--and the fairest\r\nlady that I know. If I were a man, Bell, you are just the girl that I\r\nshould worship."\r\n\r\n"But you are not a man; so it\'s no good."\r\n\r\n"But you mustn\'t let your foot go astray in that way; you mustn\'t,\r\nindeed. Somebody said, that whatever is, is right, and I declare I\r\nbelieve it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sometimes inclined to think, that whatever is, is wrong."\r\n\r\n"That\'s because you\'re a radical. I think I\'ll get up now, Bell; only\r\nit\'s so frightfully cold that I\'m afraid."\r\n\r\n"There\'s a beautiful fire," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I see. But the fire won\'t go all around me, like the bed does.\r\nI wish I could know the very moment when they\'re at the altar. It\'s\r\nonly half-past ten yet."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t be at all surprised if it\'s over."\r\n\r\n"Over! What a word that is! A thing like that is over, and then all\r\nthe world cannot put it back again. What if he should be unhappy\r\nafter all?"\r\n\r\n"He must take his chance," said Bell, thinking within her own mind\r\nthat that chance would be a very bad one.\r\n\r\n"Of course he must take his chance. Well,--I\'ll get up now." And then\r\nshe took her first step out into the cold world beyond her bed. "We\r\nmust all take our chance. I have made up my mind that it will be at\r\nhalf-past eleven."\r\n\r\nWhen half-past eleven came, she was seated in a large easy chair over\r\nthe drawing-room fire, with a little table by her side, on which a\r\nnovel was lying. She had not opened her book that morning, and had\r\nbeen sitting for some time perfectly silent, with her eyes closed,\r\nand her watch in her hand.\r\n\r\n"Mamma," she said at last, "it is over now, I\'m sure."\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: "Mamma," she said at last, "it is over now,\r\nI\'m sure."]\r\n\r\n\r\n"What is over, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"He has made that lady his wife. I hope God will bless them, and I\r\npray that they may be happy." As she spoke these words, there was an\r\nunwonted solemnity in her tone which startled Mrs. Dale and Bell.\r\n\r\n"I also will hope so," said Mrs. Dale. "And now, Lily, will it not\r\nbe well that you should turn your mind away from the subject, and\r\nendeavour to think of other things?"\r\n\r\n"But I can\'t, mamma. It is so easy to say that; but people can\'t\r\nchoose their own thoughts."\r\n\r\n"They can usually direct them as they will, if they make the effort."\r\n\r\n"But I can\'t make the effort. Indeed, I don\'t know why I should. It\r\nseems natural to me to think about him, and I don\'t suppose it can\r\nbe very wrong. When you have had so deep an interest in a person,\r\nyou can\'t drop him all of a sudden." Then there was again silence,\r\nand after a while Lily took up her novel. She made that effort of\r\nwhich her mother had spoken, but she made it altogether in vain. "I\r\ndeclare, Bell," she said, "it\'s the greatest rubbish I ever attempted\r\nto read." This was specially ungrateful, because Bell had recommended\r\nthe book. "All the books have got to be so stupid! I think I\'ll read\r\nPilgrim\'s Progress again."\r\n\r\n"What do you say to Robinson Crusoe?" said Bell.\r\n\r\n"Or Paul and Virginia?" said Lily. "But I believe I\'ll have Pilgrim\'s\r\nProgress. I never can understand it, but I rather think that makes it\r\nnicer."\r\n\r\n"I hate books I can\'t understand," said Bell. "I like a book to be\r\nclear as running water, so that the whole meaning may be seen at\r\nonce."\r\n\r\n"The quick seeing of the meaning must depend a little on the reader,\r\nmust it not?" said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"The reader mustn\'t be a fool, of course," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"But then so many readers are fools," said Lily. "And yet they get\r\nsomething out of their reading. Mrs. Crump is always poring over the\r\nRevelations, and nearly knows them by heart. I don\'t think she could\r\ninterpret a single image, but she has a hazy, misty idea of the\r\ntruth. That\'s why she likes it,--because it\'s too beautiful to be\r\nunderstood; and that\'s why I like Pilgrim\'s Progress." After which\r\nBell offered to get the book in question.\r\n\r\n"No, not now," said Lily. "I\'ll go on with this, as you say it\'s so\r\ngrand. The personages are always in their tantrums, and go on as\r\nthough they were mad. Mamma, do you know where they\'re going for the\r\nhoneymoon?"\r\n\r\n"No, my dear."\r\n\r\n"He used to talk to me about going to the lakes." And then there was\r\nanother pause, during which Bell observed that her mother\'s face\r\nbecame clouded with anxiety. "But I won\'t think of it any more,"\r\ncontinued Lily; "I will fix my mind to something." And then she got\r\nup from her chair. "I don\'t think it would have been so difficult if\r\nI had not been ill."\r\n\r\n"Of course it would not, my darling."\r\n\r\n"And I\'m going to be well again now, immediately. Let me see: I was\r\ntold to read Carlyle\'s History of the French Revolution, and I think\r\nI\'ll begin now." It was Crosbie who had told her to read the book, as\r\nboth Bell and Mrs. Dale were well aware. "But I must put it off till\r\nI can get it down from the other house."\r\n\r\n"Jane shall fetch it, if you really want it," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"Bell shall get it, when she goes up in the afternoon; will you,\r\nBell? And I\'ll try to get on with this stuff in the meantime." Then\r\nagain she sat with her eyes fixed upon the pages of the book. "I\'ll\r\ntell you what, mamma,--you may have some comfort in this: that when\r\nto-day\'s gone by, I shan\'t make a fuss about any other day."\r\n\r\n"Nobody thinks that you are making a fuss, Lily."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I am. Isn\'t it odd, Bell, that it should take place on\r\nValentine\'s day? I wonder whether it was so settled on purpose,\r\nbecause of the day. Oh, dear, I used to think so often of the letter\r\nthat I should get from him on this day, when he would tell me that I\r\nwas his valentine. Well; he\'s got another--valen--tine--now." So much\r\nshe said with articulate voice, and then she broke down, bursting out\r\ninto convulsive sobs, and crying in her mother\'s arms as though she\r\nwould break her heart. And yet her heart was not broken, and she\r\nwas still strong in that resolve which she had made, that her grief\r\nshould not overpower her. As she had herself said, the thing would\r\nnot have been so difficult, had she not been weakened by illness.\r\n\r\n"Lily, my darling; my poor, ill-used darling."\r\n\r\n"No, mamma, I won\'t be that." And she struggled grievously to get the\r\nbetter of the hysterical attack which had overpowered her. "I won\'t\r\nbe regarded as ill-used; not as specially ill-used. But I am your\r\ndarling, your own darling. Only I wish you\'d beat me and thump me\r\nwhen I\'m such a fool, instead of pitying me. It\'s a great mistake\r\nbeing soft to people when they make fools of themselves. There, Bell;\r\nthere\'s your stupid book, and I won\'t have any more of it. I believe\r\nit was that that did it." And she pushed the book away from her.\r\n\r\nAfter this little scene she said no further word about Crosbie and\r\nhis bride on that day, but turned the conversation towards the\r\nprospect of their new house at Guestwick.\r\n\r\n"It will be a great comfort to be nearer Dr. Crofts; won\'t it, Bell?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"Because if we are ill, he won\'t have such a terrible distance to\r\ncome."\r\n\r\n"That will be a comfort for him, I should think," said Bell, very\r\ndemurely.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the first volume of the French Revolution had been\r\nprocured, and Lily stuck to her reading with laudable perseverance;\r\ntill at eight her mother insisted on her going to bed, queen as she\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe a bit, you know, that the king was such a bad man as\r\nthat," she said.\r\n\r\n"I do," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s because you\'re a radical. I never will believe that kings\r\nare so much worse than other people. As for Charles the First, he was\r\nabout the best man in history."\r\n\r\nThis was an old subject of dispute; but Lily on the present occasion\r\nwas allowed her own way,--as being an invalid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nVALENTINE\'S DAY IN LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth of February in London was quite as black, and cold,\r\nand as wintersome as it was at Allington, and was, perhaps, somewhat\r\nmore melancholy in its coldness. Nevertheless Lady Alexandrina De\r\nCourcy looked as bright as bridal finery could make her, when she\r\ngot out of her carriage and walked into St. James\'s church at eleven\r\no\'clock on that morning.\r\n\r\nIt had been finally arranged that the marriage should take place in\r\nLondon. There were certainly many reasons which would have made a\r\nmarriage from Courcy Castle more convenient. The De Courcy family\r\nwere all assembled at their country family residence, and could\r\ntherefore have been present at the ceremony without cost or trouble.\r\nThe castle too was warm with the warmth of life, and the pleasantness\r\nof home would have lent a grace to the departure of one of the\r\ndaughters of the house. The retainers and servants were there, and\r\nsomething of the rich mellowness of a noble alliance might have been\r\nfelt, at any rate by Crosbie, at a marriage so celebrated. And it\r\nmust have been acknowledged, even by Lady De Courcy, that the house\r\nin Portman Square was very cold--that a marriage from thence would\r\nbe cold,--that there could be no hope of attaching to it any honour\r\nand glory, or of making it resound with fashionable eclat in the\r\ncolumns of the _Morning Post_. But then, had they been married in\r\nthe country, the earl would have been there; whereas there was no\r\nprobability of his travelling up to London for the purpose of being\r\npresent on such an occasion.\r\n\r\nThe earl was very terrible in these days, and Alexandrina, as she\r\nbecame confidential in her communications with her future husband,\r\nspoke of him as of an ogre, who could not by any means be avoided\r\nin all the concerns of life, but whom one might shun now and\r\nagain by some subtle device and careful arrangement of favourable\r\ncircumstances. Crosbie had more than once taken upon himself to hint\r\nthat he did not specially regard the ogre, seeing that for the future\r\nhe could keep himself altogether apart from the malicious monster\'s\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\n"He will not come to me in our new home," he had said to his love,\r\nwith some little touch of affection. But to this view of the case\r\nLady Alexandrina had demurred. The ogre in question was not only her\r\nparent, but was also a noble peer, and she could not agree to any\r\narrangement by which their future connection with the earl, and with\r\nnobility in general, might be endangered. Her parent, doubtless, was\r\nan ogre, and in his ogreship could make himself very terrible to\r\nthose near him; but then might it not be better for them to be near\r\nto an earl who was an ogre, than not to be near to any earl at all?\r\nShe had therefore signified to Crosbie that the ogre must be endured.\r\n\r\nBut, nevertheless, it was a great thing to be rid of him on that\r\nhappy occasion. He would have said very dreadful things,--things so\r\ndreadful that there might have been a question whether the bridegroom\r\ncould have borne them. Since he had heard of Crosbie\'s accident at\r\nthe railway station, he had constantly talked with fiendish glee of\r\nthe beating which had been administered to his son-in-law. Lady De\r\nCourcy in taking Crosbie\'s part, and maintaining that the match was\r\nfitting for her daughter, had ventured to declare before her husband\r\nthat Crosbie was a man of fashion, and the earl would now ask, with\r\na loathsome grin, whether the bridegroom\'s fashion had been improved\r\nby his little adventure at Paddington. Crosbie, to whom all this was\r\nnot repeated, would have preferred a wedding in the country. But the\r\ncountess and Lady Alexandrina knew better.\r\n\r\nThe earl had strictly interdicted any expenditure, and the countess\r\nhad of necessity construed this as forbidding any unnecessary\r\nexpense. "To marry a girl without any immediate cost was a thing\r\nwhich nobody could understand," as the countess remarked to her\r\neldest daughter.\r\n\r\n"I would really spend as little as possible," Lady Amelia had\r\nanswered. "You see, mamma, there are circumstances about it which one\r\ndoesn\'t wish to have talked about just at present. There\'s the story\r\nof that girl,--and then that fracas at the station. I really think\r\nit ought to be as quiet as possible." The good sense of Lady Amelia\r\nwas not to be disputed, as her mother acknowledged. But then if\r\nthe marriage were managed in any notoriously quiet way, the very\r\nnotoriety of that quiet would be as dangerous as an attempt at loud\r\nglory. "But it won\'t cost as much," said Amelia. And thus it had been\r\nresolved that the wedding should be very quiet.\r\n\r\nTo this Crosbie had assented very willingly, though he had not\r\nrelished the manner in which the countess had explained to him her\r\nviews.\r\n\r\n"I need not tell you, Adolphus," she had said, "how thoroughly\r\nsatisfied I am with this marriage. My dear girl feels that she can be\r\nhappy as your wife, and what more can I want? I declared to her and\r\nto Amelia that I was not ambitious, for their sakes, and have allowed\r\nthem both to please themselves."\r\n\r\n"I hope they have pleased themselves," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"I trust so; but nevertheless,--I don\'t know whether I make myself\r\nunderstood?"\r\n\r\n"Quite so, Lady De Courcy. If Alexandrina were going to marry the\r\neldest son of a marquis, you would have a longer procession to church\r\nthan will be necessary when she marries me."\r\n\r\n"You put it in such an odd way, Adolphus."\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right so long as we understand each other. I can assure you\r\nI don\'t want any procession at all. I should be quite contented to go\r\ndown with Alexandrina, arm in arm, like Darby and Joan, and let the\r\nclerk give her away."\r\n\r\nWe may say that he would have been much better contented could he\r\nhave been allowed to go down the street without any encumbrance on\r\nhis arm. But there was no possibility now for such deliverance as\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nBoth Lady Amelia and Mr. Gazebee had long since discovered the\r\nbitterness of his heart and the fact of his repentance, and Gazebee\r\nhad ventured to suggest to his wife that his noble sister-in-law was\r\npreparing for herself a life of misery.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll become quiet and happy when he\'s used to it," Lady Amelia had\r\nreplied, thinking, perhaps, of her own experiences.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, my dear; he\'s not a quiet man. There\'s something in\r\nhis eye which tells me that he could be very hard to a woman."\r\n\r\n"It has gone too far now for any change," Lady Amelia had answered.\r\n\r\n"Well; perhaps it has."\r\n\r\n"And I know my sister so well; she would not hear of it. I really\r\nthink they will do very well when they become used to each other."\r\n\r\nMr. Gazebee, who also had had his own experiences, hardly dared to\r\nhope so much. His home had been satisfactory to him, because he had\r\nbeen a calculating man, and having made his calculation correctly\r\nwas willing to take the net result. He had done so all his life with\r\nsuccess. In his house his wife was paramount,--as he very well knew.\r\nBut no effort on his wife\'s part, had she wished to make such effort,\r\ncould have forced him to spend more than two-thirds of his income.\r\nOf this she also was aware, and had trimmed her sails accordingly,\r\nlikening herself to him in this respect. But of such wisdom, and such\r\ntrimmings, and such adaptability, what likelihood was there with Mr.\r\nCrosbie and Lady Alexandrina?\r\n\r\n"At any rate, it is too late now," said Lady Amelia, thus concluding\r\nthe conversation.\r\n\r\nBut nevertheless, when the last moment came, there was some little\r\nattempt at glory. Who does not know the way in which a lately\r\nmarried couple\'s little dinner-party stretches itself out from the\r\npure simplicity of a fried sole and a leg of mutton to the attempt\r\nat clear soup, the unfortunately cold dish of round balls which\r\nis handed about after the sole, and the brightly red jelly, and\r\nbeautifully pink cream, which are ordered, in the last agony of\r\nambition, from the next pastrycook\'s shop?\r\n\r\n"We cannot give a dinner, my dear, with only cook and Sarah."\r\n\r\nIt has thus begun, and the husband has declared that he has no such\r\nidea. "If Phipps and Dowdney can come here and eat a bit of mutton,\r\nthey are very welcome; if not, let them stay away. And you might as\r\nwell ask Phipps\'s sister; just to have some one to go with you into\r\nthe drawing-room."\r\n\r\n"I\'d much rather go alone, because then I can read,"--or sleep, we\r\nmay say.\r\n\r\nBut her husband has explained that she would look friendless in this\r\nsolitary state, and therefore Phipps\'s sister has been asked. Then\r\nthe dinner has progressed down to those costly jellies which have\r\nbeen ordered in a last agony. There has been a conviction on the\r\nminds of both of them that the simple leg of mutton would have been\r\nmore jolly for them all. Had those round balls not been carried about\r\nby a hired man; had simple mutton with hot potatoes been handed to\r\nMiss Phipps by Sarah, Miss Phipps would not have simpered with such\r\nunmeaning stiffness when young Dowdney spoke to her. They would have\r\nbeen much more jolly. "Have a bit more mutton, Phipps; and where\r\ndo you like it?" How pleasant it sounds! But we all know that it\r\nis impossible. My young friend had intended this, but his dinner\r\nhad run itself away to cold round balls and coloured forms from the\r\npastrycook. And so it was with the Crosbie marriage.\r\n\r\nThe bride must leave the church in a properly appointed carriage, and\r\nthe postboys must have wedding favours. So the thing grew; not into\r\nnoble proportions, not into proportions of true glory, justifying\r\nthe attempt and making good the gala. A well-cooked rissole, brought\r\npleasantly to you, is good eating. A gala marriage, when everything\r\nis in keeping, is excellent sport. Heaven forbid that we should\r\nhave no gala marriages. But the small spasmodic attempt, made in\r\nopposition to manifest propriety, made with an inner conviction of\r\nfailure,--that surely should be avoided in marriages, in dinners, and\r\nin all affairs of life.\r\n\r\nThere were bridesmaids and there was a breakfast. Both Margaretta and\r\nRosina came up to London for the occasion, as did also a first cousin\r\nof theirs, one Miss Gresham, a lady whose father lived in the same\r\ncounty. Mr. Gresham had married a sister of Lord De Courcy\'s, and his\r\nservices were also called into requisition. He was brought up to give\r\naway the bride, because the earl,--as the paragraph in the newspaper\r\ndeclared,--was confined at Courcy Castle by his old hereditary enemy,\r\nthe gout. A fourth bridesmaid also was procured, and thus there was\r\na bevy, though not so large a bevy as is now generally thought to be\r\ndesirable. There were only three or four carriages at the church, but\r\neven three or four were something. The weather was so frightfully\r\ncold that the light-coloured silks of the ladies carried with them\r\na show of discomfort. Girls should be very young to look nice in\r\nlight dresses on a frosty morning, and the bridesmaids at Lady\r\nAlexandrina\'s wedding were not very young. Lady Rosina\'s nose was\r\ndecidedly red. Lady Margaretta was very wintry, and apparently very\r\ncross. Miss Gresham was dull, tame, and insipid; and the Honourable\r\nMiss O\'Flaherty, who filled the fourth place, was sulky at finding\r\nthat she had been invited to take a share in so very lame a\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nBut the marriage was made good, and Crosbie bore up against his\r\nmisfortunes like a man. Montgomerie Dobbs and Fowler Pratt both stood\r\nby him, giving him, let us hope, some assurance that he was not\r\nabsolutely deserted by all the world,--that he had not given himself\r\nup, bound hand and foot, to the De Courcys, to be dealt with in all\r\nmatters as they might please. It was that feeling which had been so\r\ngrievous to him,--and that other feeling, cognate to it, that if he\r\nshould ultimately succeed in rebelling against the De Courcys, he\r\nwould find himself a solitary man.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I shall go," Fowler Pratt had said to Montgomerie Dobbs.\r\n"I always stick to a fellow if I can. Crosbie has behaved like a\r\nblackguard, and like a fool also; and he knows that I think so. But I\r\ndon\'t see why I should drop him on that account. I shall go as he has\r\nasked me."\r\n\r\n"So shall I," said Montgomerie Dobbs, who considered that he would be\r\nsafe in doing whatever Fowler Pratt did, and who remarked to himself\r\nthat after all Crosbie was marrying the daughter of an earl.\r\n\r\nThen, after the marriage, came the breakfast, at which the countess\r\npresided with much noble magnificence. She had not gone to church,\r\nthinking, no doubt, that she would be better able to maintain her\r\ngood humour at the feast, if she did not subject herself to the\r\nchance of lumbago in the church. At the foot of the table sat Mr.\r\nGresham, her brother-in-law, who had undertaken to give the necessary\r\ntoast and make the necessary speech. The Honourable John was there,\r\nsaying all manner of ill-natured things about his sister and new\r\nbrother-in-law, because he had been excluded from his proper position\r\nat the foot of the table. But Alexandrina had declared that she would\r\nnot have the matter entrusted to her brother. The Honourable George\r\nwould not come, because the countess had not asked his wife.\r\n\r\n"Maria may be slow, and all that sort of thing," George had said;\r\n"but she is my wife. And she had got what they haven\'t. Love me, love\r\nmy dog, you know." So he had stayed down at Courcy,--very properly as\r\nI think.\r\n\r\nAlexandrina had wished to go away before breakfast, and Crosbie would\r\nnot have cared how early an escape had been provided for him; but\r\nthe countess had told her daughter that if she would not wait for\r\nthe breakfast, there should be no breakfast at all, and in fact no\r\nwedding; nothing but a simple marriage. Had there been a grand party,\r\nthat going away of the bride and bridegroom might be very well; but\r\nthe countess felt that on such an occasion as this nothing but the\r\npresence of the body of the sacrifice could give any reality to\r\nthe festivity. So Crosbie and Lady Alexandrina Crosbie heard Mr.\r\nGresham\'s speech, in which he prophesied for the young couple an\r\namount of happiness and prosperity almost greater than is compatible\r\nwith the circumstances of humanity. His young friend Crosbie, whose\r\nacquaintance he had been delighted to make, was well known as one\r\nof the rising pillars of the State. Whether his future career might\r\nbe parliamentary, or devoted to the permanent Civil Service of the\r\ncountry, it would be alike great, noble, and prosperous. As to his\r\ndear niece, who was now filling that position in life which was\r\nmost beautiful and glorious for a young woman,--she could not\r\nhave done better. She had preferred genius to wealth,--so said Mr.\r\nGresham,--and she would find her fitting reward. As to her finding\r\nher fitting reward, whatever her preferences may have been, there Mr.\r\nGresham was no doubt quite right. On that head I myself have no doubt\r\nwhatever. After that Crosbie returned thanks, making a much better\r\nspeech than nine men do out of ten on such occasions, and then the\r\nthing was over. No other speaking was allowed, and within half an\r\nhour from that time, he and his bride were in the post-chaise, being\r\ncarried away to the Folkestone railway station; for that place had\r\nbeen chosen as the scene of their honeymoon. It had been at one time\r\nintended that the journey to Folkestone should be made simply as the\r\nfirst stage to Paris, but Paris and all foreign travelling had been\r\ngiven up by degrees.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care a bit about France,--we have been there so often,"\r\nAlexandrina said.\r\n\r\nShe had wished to be taken to Naples, but Crosbie had made her\r\nunderstand at the first whispering of the word, that Naples was quite\r\nout of the question. He must look now in all things to money. From\r\nthe very first outset of his career he must save a shilling wherever\r\na shilling could be saved. To this view of life no opposition was\r\nmade by the De Courcy interest. Lady Amelia had explained to her\r\nsister that they ought so to do their honeymooning that it should not\r\ncost more than if they began keeping house at once. Certain things\r\nmust be done which, no doubt, were costly in their nature. The bride\r\nmust take with her a well-dressed lady\'s-maid. The rooms at the\r\nFolkestone hotel must be large, and on the first floor. A carriage\r\nmust be hired for her use while she remained; but every shilling must\r\nbe saved the spending of which would not make itself apparent to the\r\nouter world. Oh, deliver us from the poverty of those who, with small\r\nmeans, affect a show of wealth! There is no whitening equal to that\r\nof sepulchres whited as they are whited!\r\n\r\nBy the proper administration of a slight bribe Crosbie secured\r\nfor himself and his wife a compartment in the railway carriage to\r\nthemselves. And as he seated himself opposite to Alexandrina, having\r\nproperly tucked her up with all her bright-coloured trappings, he\r\nremembered that he had never in truth been alone with her before.\r\nHe had danced with her frequently, and been left with her for a few\r\nminutes between the figures. He had flirted with her in crowded\r\ndrawing-rooms, and had once found a moment at Courcy Castle to tell\r\nher that he was willing to marry her in spite of his engagement with\r\nLilian Dale. But he had never walked with her for hours together as\r\nhe had walked with Lily. He had never talked to her about government,\r\nand politics, and books, nor had she talked to him of poetry, of\r\nreligion, and of the little duties and comforts of life. He had known\r\nthe Lady Alexandrina for the last six or seven years; but he had\r\nnever known her,--perhaps never would know her,--as he had learned to\r\nknow Lily Dale within the space of two months.\r\n\r\nAnd now that she was his wife, what was he to say to her? They\r\ntwo had commenced a partnership which was to make of them for the\r\nremaining term of their lives one body and one flesh. They were to\r\nbe all-in-all to each other. But how was he to begin this all-in-all\r\npartnership? Had the priest, with his blessing, done it so\r\nsufficiently that no other doing on Crosbie\'s own part was necessary?\r\nThere she was, opposite to him, his very actual wife,--bone of his\r\nbone; and what was he to say to her? As he settled himself on his\r\nseat, taking over his own knees a part of a fine fur rug trimmed with\r\nscarlet, with which he had covered her other mufflings, he bethought\r\nhimself how much easier it would have been to talk to Lily. And Lily\r\nwould have been ready with all her ears, and all her mind, and all\r\nher wit, to enter quickly upon whatever thoughts had occurred to him.\r\nIn that respect Lily would have been a wife indeed,--a wife that\r\nwould have transferred herself with quick mental activity into her\r\nhusband\'s mental sphere. Had he begun about his office Lily would\r\nhave been ready for him, but Alexandrina had never yet asked him a\r\nsingle question about his official life. Had he been prepared with a\r\nplan for to-morrow\'s happiness Lily would have taken it up eagerly,\r\nbut Alexandrina never cared for such trifles.\r\n\r\n"Are you quite comfortable?" he said, at last.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, quite, thank you. By-the-by, what did you do with my\r\ndressing-case?"\r\n\r\nAnd that question she did ask with some energy.\r\n\r\n"It is under you. You can have it as foot-stool if you like it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; I should scratch it. I was afraid that if Hannah had it,\r\nit might be lost." Then again there was silence, and Crosbie again\r\nconsidered as to what he would next say to his wife.\r\n\r\nWe all know the advice given us of old as to what we should do\r\nunder such circumstances; and who can be so thoroughly justified in\r\nfollowing that advice as a newly-married husband? So he put out his\r\nhand for hers and drew her closer to him.\r\n\r\n"Take care of my bonnet," she said, as she felt the motion of the\r\nrailway carriage when he kissed her. I don\'t think he kissed her\r\nagain till he had landed her and her bonnet safely at Folkestone. How\r\noften would he have kissed Lily, and how pretty would her bonnet have\r\nbeen when she reached the end of her journey, and how delightfully\r\nhappy would she have looked when she scolded him for bending it! But\r\nAlexandrina was quite in earnest about her bonnet; by far too much in\r\nearnest for any appearance of happiness.\r\n\r\nSo he sat without speaking, till the train came to the tunnel.\r\n\r\n"I do so hate tunnels," said Alexandrina.\r\n\r\nHe had half intended to put out his hand again, under some mistaken\r\nidea that the tunnel afforded him an opportunity. The whole journey\r\nwas one long opportunity, had he desired it; but his wife hated\r\ntunnels, and so he drew his hand back again. Lily\'s little fingers\r\nwould have been ready for his touch. He thought of this, and could\r\nnot help thinking of it.\r\n\r\nHe had _The Times_ newspaper in his dressing-bag. She also had a\r\nnovel with her. Would she be offended if he took out the paper and\r\nread it? The miles seemed to pass by very slowly, and there was still\r\nanother hour down to Folkestone. He longed for his _Times_, but\r\nresolved at last that he would not read unless she read first. She\r\nalso had remembered her novel; but by nature she was more patient\r\nthan he, and she thought that on such a journey any reading might\r\nperhaps be almost improper. So she sat tranquilly, with her eyes\r\nfixed on the netting over her husband\'s head.\r\n\r\nAt last he could stand it no longer, and he dashed off into a\r\nconversation, intended to be most affectionate and serious.\r\n\r\n"Alexandrina," he said, and his voice was well-tuned for the tender\r\nserious manner, had her ears been alive to such tuning. "Alexandrina,\r\nthis is a very important step that you and I have taken to-day."\r\n\r\n"Yes; it is, indeed," said she.\r\n\r\n"I trust we shall succeed in making each other happy."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I hope we shall."\r\n\r\n"If we both think seriously of it, and remember that that is our\r\nchief duty, we shall do so."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I suppose we shall. I only hope we shan\'t find the house very\r\ncold. It is so new, and I am so subject to colds in my head. Amelia\r\nsays we shall find it very cold; but then she was always against our\r\ngoing there."\r\n\r\n"The house will do very well," said Crosbie. And Alexandrina could\r\nperceive that there was something of the master in his tone as he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n"I am only telling you what Amelia said," she replied.\r\n\r\nHad Lily been his bride, and had he spoken to her of their future\r\nlife and mutual duties, how she would have kindled to the theme!\r\nShe would have knelt at his feet on the floor of the carriage,\r\nand, looking up into his face, would have promised him to do her\r\nbest,--her best,--her very best. And with what an eagerness of inward\r\nresolution would she have determined to keep her promise. He thought\r\nof all this now, but he knew that he ought not to think of it. Then,\r\nfor some quarter of an hour, he did take out his newspaper, and she,\r\nwhen she saw him do so, did take out her novel.\r\n\r\nHe took out his newspaper, but he could not fix his mind upon the\r\npolitics of the day. Had he not made a terrible mistake? Of what\r\nuse to him in life would be that thing of a woman that sat opposite\r\nto him? Had not a great punishment come upon him, and had he not\r\ndeserved the punishment? In truth, a great punishment had come\r\nupon him. It was not only that he had married a woman incapable of\r\nunderstanding the higher duties of married life, but that he himself\r\nwould have been capable of appreciating the value of a woman who\r\ndid understand them. He would have been happy with Lily Dale; and\r\ntherefore we may surmise that his unhappiness with Lady Alexandrina\r\nwould be the greater. There are men who, in marrying such as Lady\r\nAlexandrina De Courcy, would get the article best suited to them,\r\nas Mortimer Gazebee had done in marrying her sister. Miss Griselda\r\nGrantly, who had become Lady Dumbello, though somewhat colder and\r\nsomewhat cleverer than Lady Alexandrina, had been of the same sort.\r\nBut in marrying her, Lord Dumbello had got the article best suited\r\nto him;--if only the ill-natured world would allow him to keep\r\nthe article. It was in this that Crosbie\'s failure had been so\r\ngrievous,--that he had seen and approved the better course, but had\r\nchosen for himself to walk in that which was worse. During that week\r\nat Courcy Castle,--the week which he passed there immediately after\r\nhis second visit to Allington,--he had deliberately made up his mind\r\nthat he was more fit for the bad course than for the good one. The\r\ncourse was now before him, and he had no choice but to walk in it.\r\n\r\nIt was very cold when they got to Folkestone, and Lady Alexandrina\r\nshivered as she stepped into the private-looking carriage which had\r\nbeen sent to the station for her use.\r\n\r\n"We shall find a good fire in the parlour at the hotel," said\r\nCrosbie.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hope so," said Alexandrina, "and in the bedroom too."\r\n\r\nThe young husband felt himself to be offended, but he hardly knew\r\nwhy. He felt himself to be offended, and with difficulty induced\r\nhimself to go through all those little ceremonies the absence\r\nof which would have been remarked by everybody. He did his work,\r\nhowever, seeing to all her shawls and wrappings, speaking with\r\ngood-nature to Hannah, and paying special attention to the\r\ndressing-case.\r\n\r\n"What time would you like to dine?" he asked, as he prepared to leave\r\nher alone with Hannah in the bedroom.\r\n\r\n"Whenever you please; only I should like some tea and\r\nbread-and-butter presently."\r\n\r\nCrosbie went into the sitting-room, ordered the tea and\r\nbread-and-butter, ordered also the dinner, and then stood himself up\r\nwith his back to the fire, in order that he might think a little of\r\nhis future career.\r\n\r\nHe was a man who had long since resolved that his life should be a\r\nsuccess. It would seem that all men would so resolve, if the matter\r\nwere simply one of resolution. But the majority of men, as I take it,\r\nmake no such resolution, and very many men resolve that they will\r\nbe unsuccessful. Crosbie, however, had resolved on success, and had\r\ndone much towards carrying out his purpose. He had made a name for\r\nhimself, and had acquired a certain fame. That, however, was, as he\r\nacknowledged to himself, departing from him. He looked the matter\r\nstraight in the face, and told himself that his fashion must be\r\nabandoned; but the office remained to him. He might still rule over\r\nMr. Optimist, and make a subservient slave of Butterwell. That must\r\nbe his line in life now, and to that line he would endeavour to\r\nbe true. As to his wife and his home,--he would look to them for\r\nhis breakfast, and perhaps his dinner. He would have a comfortable\r\narm-chair, and if Alexandrina should become a mother, he would\r\nendeavour to love his children; but above all things he would never\r\nthink of Lily. After that he stood and thought of her for half an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n"If you please, sir, my lady wants to know at what time you have\r\nordered dinner."\r\n\r\n"At seven, Hannah."\r\n\r\n"My lady says she is very tired, and will lie down till dinner-time."\r\n\r\n"Very well, Hannah. I will go into her room when it is time to dress.\r\nI hope they are making you comfortable downstairs?"\r\n\r\nThen Crosbie strolled out on the pier in the dusk of the cold winter\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nJOHN EAMES AT HIS OFFICE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: (untitled)]\r\n\r\nMr. Crosbie and his wife went upon their honeymoon tour to Folkestone\r\nin the middle of February, and returned to London about the end\r\nof March. Nothing of special moment to the interests of our story\r\noccurred during those six weeks, unless the proceedings of the\r\nyoung married couple by the sea-side may be thought to have any\r\nspecial interest. With regard to those proceedings I can only say\r\nthat Crosbie was very glad when they were brought to a close. All\r\nholiday-making is hard work, but holiday-making with nothing to do is\r\nthe hardest work of all. At the end of March they went into their new\r\nhouse, and we will hope that Lady Alexandrina did not find it very\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Lily\'s recovery from her illness was being\r\ncompleted. She had no relapse, nor did anything occur to create a new\r\nfear on her account. But, nevertheless, Dr. Crofts gave it as his\r\nopinion that it would be inexpedient to move her into a fresh house\r\nat Lady-day. March is not a kindly month for invalids; and therefore\r\nwith some regret on the part of Mrs. Dale, with much impatience on\r\nthat of Bell, and with considerable outspoken remonstrance from Lily\r\nherself, the squire was requested to let them remain through the\r\nmonth of April. How the squire received this request, and in what way\r\nhe assented to the doctor\'s reasoning, will be told in the course of\r\na chapter or two.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime John Eames had continued his career in London without\r\nmuch immediate satisfaction to himself, or to the lady who boasted to\r\nbe his heart\'s chosen queen. Miss Amelia Roper, indeed, was becoming\r\nvery cross, and in her ill-temper was playing a game that was tending\r\nto create a frightful amount of hot water in Burton Crescent. She was\r\ndevoting herself to a flirtation with Mr. Cradell, not only under the\r\nimmediate eyes of Johnny Eames, but also under those of Mrs. Lupex.\r\nJohn Eames, the blockhead, did not like it. He was above all things\r\nanxious to get rid of Amelia and her claims; so anxious, that on\r\ncertain moody occasions he would threaten himself with diverse\r\ntragical terminations to his career in London. He would enlist. He\r\nwould go to Australia. He would blow out his brains. He would have\r\n"an explanation" with Amelia, tell her that she was a vixen, and\r\nproclaim his hatred. He would rush down to Allington and throw\r\nhimself in despair at Lily\'s feet. Amelia was the bugbear of his\r\nlife. Nevertheless, when she flirted with Cradell, he did not like\r\nit, and was ass enough to speak to Cradell about it.\r\n\r\n"Of course I don\'t care," he said, "only it seems to me that you are\r\nmaking a fool of yourself."\r\n\r\n"I thought you wanted to get rid of her."\r\n\r\n"She\'s nothing on earth to me; only it does, you know--"\r\n\r\n"Does do what?" asked Cradell.\r\n\r\n"Why, if I was to be fal-lalling with that married woman, you\r\nwouldn\'t like it. That\'s all about it. Do you mean to marry her?"\r\n\r\n"What!--Amelia?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; Amelia."\r\n\r\n"Not if I know it."\r\n\r\n"Then if I were you I would leave her alone. She\'s only making a fool\r\nof you."\r\n\r\nEames\'s advice may have been good, and the view taken by him of\r\nAmelia\'s proceedings may have been correct; but as regarded his own\r\npart in the affair, he was not wise. Miss Roper, no doubt, wished to\r\nmake him jealous; and she succeeded in the teeth of his aversion to\r\nher and of his love elsewhere. He had no desire to say soft things\r\nto Miss Roper. Miss Roper, with all her skill, could not extract a\r\nword pleasantly soft from him once a week. But, nevertheless, soft\r\nwords to her and from her in another quarter made him uneasy. Such\r\nbeing the case, must we not acknowledge that John Eames was still\r\nfloundering in the ignorance of his hobbledehoyhood?\r\n\r\nThe Lupexes at this time still held their ground in the Crescent,\r\nalthough repeated warnings to go had been given them. Mrs. Roper,\r\nthough she constantly spoke of sacrificing all that they owed her,\r\nstill hankered, with a natural hankering, after her money. And as\r\neach warning was accompanied by a demand for payment, and usually\r\nproduced some slight subsidy on account, the thing went on from week\r\nto week; and at the beginning of April Mr. and Mrs. Lupex were still\r\nboarders at Mrs. Roper\'s house.\r\n\r\nEames had heard nothing from Allington since the time of his\r\nChristmas visit, and his subsequent correspondence with Lord De\r\nGuest. In his letters from his mother he was told that game came\r\nfrequently from Guestwick Manor, and in this way he knew that he\r\nwas not forgotten by the earl. But of Lily he had heard not a\r\nword,--except, indeed, the rumour, which had now become general, that\r\nthe Dales from the Small House were about to move themselves into\r\nGuestwick. When first he learned this he construed the tidings as\r\nfavourable to himself, thinking that Lily, removed from the grandeur\r\nof Allington, might possibly be more easily within his reach; but,\r\nlatterly, he had given up any such hope as that, and was telling\r\nhimself that his friend at the Manor had abandoned all idea of making\r\nup the marriage. Three months had already elapsed since his visit.\r\nFive months had passed since Crosbie had surrendered his claim.\r\nSurely such a knave as Crosbie might be forgotten in five months!\r\nIf any steps could have been taken through the squire, surely three\r\nmonths would have sufficed for them! It was very manifest to him\r\nthat there was no ground of hope for him at Allington, and it would\r\ncertainly be well for him to go off to Australia. He would go to\r\nAustralia, but he would thrash Cradell first for having dared to\r\ninterfere with Amelia Roper. That, generally, was the state of his\r\nmind during the first week in April.\r\n\r\nThen there came to him a letter from the earl which instantly\r\neffected a great change in all his feelings; which taught him to\r\nregard Australia as a dream, and almost put him into a good humour\r\nwith Cradell. The earl had by no means lost sight of his friend\'s\r\ninterests at Allington; and, moreover, those interests were now\r\nbacked by an ally who in this matter must be regarded as much more\r\npowerful than the earl. The squire had given in his consent to the\r\nEames alliance.\r\n\r\nThe earl\'s letter was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Guestwick Manor, April 7, 18--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR JOHN,\r\n\r\n   I told you to write to me again, and you haven\'t done it.\r\n   I saw your mother the other day, or else you might have\r\n   been dead for anything I knew. A young man always ought to\r\n   write letters when he is told to do so.\r\n\r\nEames, when he had got so far, felt himself rather aggrieved by this\r\nrebuke, knowing that he had abstained from writing to his patron\r\nsimply from an unwillingness to intrude upon him with his letters.\r\n"By Jove, I\'ll write to him every week of his life, till he\'s sick of\r\nme," Johnny said to himself when he found himself thus instructed as\r\nto a young man\'s duties.\r\n\r\n   And now I have got to tell you a long story, and I should\r\n   like it much better if you were down here, so that I\r\n   might save myself the trouble; but you would think me\r\n   ill-natured if I were to keep you waiting. I happened to\r\n   meet Mr. Dale the other day, and he said that he should be\r\n   very glad if a certain young lady would make up her mind\r\n   to listen to a certain young friend of mine. So I asked\r\n   him what he meant to do about the young lady\'s fortune,\r\n   and he declared himself willing to give her a hundred a\r\n   year during his life, and to settle four thousand pounds\r\n   upon her after his death. I said that I would do as much\r\n   on my part by the young man; but as two hundred a year,\r\n   with your salary, would hardly give you enough to begin\r\n   with, I\'ll make mine a hundred and fifty. You\'ll be\r\n   getting up in your office soon, and with five hundred a\r\n   year you ought to be able to get along; especially as you\r\n   need not insure your life. I should live somewhere near\r\n   Bloomsbury Square at first, because I\'m told you can get\r\n   a house for nothing. After all, what\'s fashion worth? You\r\n   can bring your wife down here in the autumn, and have some\r\n   shooting. She won\'t let you go to sleep under the trees,\r\n   I\'ll be bound.\r\n\r\n   But you must look after the young lady. You will\r\n   understand that no one has said a word to her about it;\r\n   or, if they have, I don\'t know it. You\'ll find the squire\r\n   on your side, that\'s all. Couldn\'t you manage to come down\r\n   this Easter? Tell old Buffle, with my compliments, that I\r\n   want you. I\'ll write to him if you like it. I did know him\r\n   at one time, though I can\'t say I was ever very fond of\r\n   him. It stands to reason that you can\'t get on with Miss\r\n   Lily without seeing her; unless, indeed, you like better\r\n   to write to her, which always seems to me to be very poor\r\n   sort of fun. You\'d much better come down, and go a-wooing\r\n   in the regular old-fashioned way. I need not tell you\r\n   that Lady Julia will be delighted to see you. You are a\r\n   prime favourite with her since that affair at the railway\r\n   station. She thinks a great deal more about that than she\r\n   does about the bull.\r\n\r\n   Now, my dear fellow, you know all about it, and I shall\r\n   take it very much amiss of you if you don\'t answer my\r\n   letter soon.\r\n\r\n   Your very sincere friend,\r\n\r\n   DE GUEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Eames had finished this letter, sitting at his office-desk, his\r\nsurprise and elation were so great that he hardly knew where he was\r\nor what he ought to do. Could it be the truth that Lily\'s uncle had\r\nnot only consented that the match should be made, but that he had\r\nalso promised to give his niece a considerable fortune? For a few\r\nminutes it seemed to Johnny as though all obstacles to his happiness\r\nwere removed, and that there was no impediment between him and an\r\namount of bliss of which he had hitherto hardly dared to dream. Then,\r\nwhen he considered the earl\'s munificence, he almost cried. He found\r\nthat he could not compose his mind to think, or even his hand to\r\nwrite. He did not know whether it would be right in him to accept\r\nsuch pecuniary liberality from any living man, and almost thought\r\nthat he should feel himself bound to reject the earl\'s offer. As to\r\nthe squire\'s money, that he knew he might accept. All that comes in\r\nthe shape of a young woman\'s fortune may be taken by any man.\r\n\r\nHe would certainly answer the earl\'s letter, and that at once. He\r\nwould not leave the office till he had done so. His friend should\r\nhave cause to bring no further charge against him of that kind. And\r\nthen again he reverted to the injustice which had been done to him in\r\nthe matter of letter-writing--as if that consideration were of moment\r\nin such a state of circumstances as was now existing. But at last\r\nhis thoughts brought themselves to the real question at issue. Would\r\nLily Dale accept him? After all, the realization of his good fortune\r\ndepended altogether upon her feelings; and, as he remembered this,\r\nhis mind misgave him sorely. It was filled not only with a young\r\nlover\'s ordinary doubts,--with the fear and trembling incidental to\r\nthe bashfulness of hobbledehoyhood--but with an idea that that affair\r\nwith Crosbie would still stand in his way. He did not, perhaps,\r\nrightly understand all that Lily had suffered, but he conceived it\r\nto be probable that there had been wounds which even the last five\r\nmonths might not yet have cured. Could it be that she would allow him\r\nto cure these wounds? As he thought of this he felt almost crushed\r\nto the earth by an indomitable bashfulness and conviction of his own\r\nunworthiness. What had he to offer worthy of the acceptance of such a\r\ngirl as Lilian Dale?\r\n\r\nI fear that the Crown did not get out of John Eames an adequate\r\nreturn for his salary on that day. So adequate, however, had been the\r\nreturn given by him for some time past, that promotion was supposed\r\nthroughout the Income-tax Office to be coming in his way, much to\r\nthe jealousy of Cradell, Fisher, and others, his immediate compeers\r\nand cronies. And the place assigned to him by rumour was one which\r\nwas generally regarded as a perfect Elysium upon earth in the Civil\r\nService world. He was, so rumour said, to become private secretary to\r\nthe First Commissioner. He would be removed by such a change as this\r\nfrom the large uncarpeted room in which he at present sat; occupying\r\nthe same desk with another man to whom he had felt himself to be\r\nignominiously bound, as dogs must feel when they are coupled. This\r\nroom had been the bear-garden of the office. Twelve or fourteen\r\nmen sat in it. Large pewter pots were brought into it daily at one\r\no\'clock, giving it an air that was not aristocratic. The senior\r\nof the room, one Mr. Love, who was presumed to have it under his\r\nimmediate dominion, was a clerk of the ancient stamp, dull, heavy,\r\nunambitious, living out on the farther side of Islington, and unknown\r\nbeyond the limits of his office to any of his younger brethren.\r\nHe was generally regarded as having given a bad tone to the room.\r\nAnd then the clerks in this room would not unfrequently be blown\r\nup,--with very palpable blowings up,--by an official swell, a certain\r\nchief clerk, named Kissing, much higher in standing though younger in\r\nage than the gentleman of whom we have before spoken. He would hurry\r\nin, out of his own neighbouring chamber, with quick step and nose in\r\nthe air, shuffling in his office slippers, looking on each occasion\r\nas though there were some cause to fear that the whole Civil Service\r\nwere coming to an abrupt termination, and would lay about him with\r\nhard words, which some of those in the big room did not find it very\r\neasy to bear. His hair was always brushed straight up, his eyes were\r\nalways very wide open,--and he usually carried a big letter-book with\r\nhim, keeping in it a certain place with his finger. This book was\r\nalmost too much for his strength, and he would flop it down, now on\r\nthis man\'s desk and now on that man\'s, and in a long career of such\r\nfloppings had made himself to be very much hated. On the score of\r\nsome old grudge he and Mr. Love did not speak to each other; and for\r\nthis reason, on all occasions of fault-finding, the blown-up young\r\nman would refer Mr. Kissing to his enemy.\r\n\r\n"I know nothing about it," Mr. Love would say, not lifting his face\r\nfrom his desk for a moment.\r\n\r\n"I shall certainly lay the matter before the Board," Mr. Kissing\r\nwould reply, and would then shuffle out of the room with the big\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nSometimes Mr. Kissing would lay the matter before the Board, and\r\nthen he, and Mr. Love, and two or three delinquent clerks would be\r\nsummoned thither. It seldom led to much. The delinquent clerks would\r\nbe cautioned. One Commissioner would say a word in private to Mr.\r\nLove, and another a word in private to Mr. Kissing. Then, when left\r\nalone, the Commissioners would have their little jokes, saying that\r\nKissing, they feared, went by favour; and that Love should still be\r\nlord of all. But these things were done in the mild days, before Sir\r\nRaffle Buffle came to the Board.\r\n\r\nThere had been some fun in this at first; but of late John Eames had\r\nbecome tired of it. He disliked Mr. Kissing, and the big book out\r\nof which Mr. Kissing was always endeavouring to convict him of some\r\nofficial sin, and had got tired of that joke of setting Kissing\r\nand Love by the ears together. When the Assistant Secretary first\r\nsuggested to him that Sir Raffle had an idea of selecting him as\r\nprivate secretary, and when he remembered the cosy little room, all\r\ncarpeted, with a leathern arm-chair and a separate washing-stand,\r\nwhich in such case would be devoted to his use, and remembered\r\nalso that he would be put into receipt of an additional hundred a\r\nyear, and would stand in the way of still better promotion, he was\r\noverjoyed. But there were certain drawbacks. The present private\r\nsecretary,--who had been private secretary also to the late First\r\nCommissioner,--was giving up his Elysium because he could not endure\r\nthe tones of Sir Raffle\'s voice. It was understood that Sir Raffle\r\nrequired rather more of a private secretary, in the way of obsequious\r\nattendance, than was desirable, and Eames almost doubted his own\r\nfitness for the place.\r\n\r\n"And why should he choose me?" he had asked the Assistant Secretary.\r\n\r\n"Well, we have talked it over together, and I think that he prefers\r\nyou to any other that has been named."\r\n\r\n"But he was so very hard upon me about the affair at the railway\r\nstation."\r\n\r\n"I think he has heard more about that since; I think that some\r\nmessage has reached him from your friend, Earl De Guest."\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed!" said Johnny, beginning to comprehend what it was to\r\nhave an earl for his friend. Since his acquaintance with the nobleman\r\nhad commenced, he had studiously avoided all mention of the earl\'s\r\nname at his office; and yet he received almost daily intimation that\r\nthe fact was well known there, and not a little considered.\r\n\r\n"But he is so very rough," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"You can put up with that," said his friend the Assistant Secretary.\r\n"His bark is worse than his bite, as you know; and then a hundred a\r\nyear is worth having." Eames was at that moment inclined to take a\r\ngloomy view of life in general, and was disposed to refuse the place,\r\nshould it be offered to him. He had not then received the earl\'s\r\nletter; but now, as he sat with that letter open before him, lying\r\nin the drawer beneath his desk so that he could still read it as he\r\nleaned back in his chair, he was enabled to look at things in general\r\nthrough a different atmosphere. In the first place, Lilian Dale\'s\r\nhusband ought to have a room to himself, with a carpet and an\r\narm-chair; and then that additional hundred a year would raise his\r\nincome at once to the sum as to which the earl had made some sort of\r\nstipulation. But could he get that leave of absence at Easter? If he\r\nconsented to be Sir Raffle\'s private secretary, he would make that a\r\npart of the bargain.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door of the big room was opened, and Mr. Kissing\r\nshuffled in with very quick little steps. He shuffled in, and coming\r\ndirect up to John\'s desk, flopped his ledger down upon it before its\r\nowner had had time to close the drawer which contained the precious\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n"What have you got in that drawer, Mr. Eames?"\r\n\r\n"A private letter, Mr. Kissing."\r\n\r\n"Oh;--a private letter!" said Mr. Kissing, feeling strongly convinced\r\nthere was a novel hidden there, but not daring to express his belief.\r\n"I have been half the morning, Mr. Eames, looking for this letter\r\nto the Admiralty, and you\'ve put it under S!" A bystander listening\r\nto Mr. Kissing\'s tone would have been led to believe that the whole\r\nIncome-tax Office was jeopardized by the terrible iniquity thus\r\ndisclosed.\r\n\r\n"Somerset House," pleaded Johnny.\r\n\r\n"Psha;--Somerset House! Half the offices in London--"\r\n\r\n"You\'d better ask Mr. Love," said Eames. "It\'s all done under his\r\nspecial instructions." Mr. Kissing looked at Mr. Love, and Mr.\r\nLove looked steadfastly at his desk. "Mr. Love knows all about the\r\nindexing," continued Johnny. "He\'s index master general to the\r\ndepartment."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not, Mr. Eames," said Mr. Love, who rather liked John Eames,\r\nand hated Mr. Kissing with his whole heart. "But I believe the\r\nindexes, on the whole, are very well done in this room. Some people\r\ndon\'t know how to find letters."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Eames," began Mr. Kissing, still pointing with a finger of\r\nbitter reproach to the misused S, and beginning an oration which was\r\nintended for the benefit of the whole room, and for the annihilation\r\nof old Mr. Love, "if you have yet to learn that the word Admiralty\r\nbegins with A and not with S, you have much to learn which should\r\nhave been acquired before you first came into this office. Somerset\r\nHouse is not a department." Then he turned round to the room at\r\nlarge, and repeated the last words, as though they might become very\r\nuseful if taken well to heart--"Is not a department. The Treasury is\r\na department; the Home Office is a department; the India Board is a\r\ndepartment--"\r\n\r\n"No, Mr. Kissing, it isn\'t," said a young clerk from the other end of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n"You know very well what I mean, sir. The India Office is a\r\ndepartment."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no Board, sir."\r\n\r\n"Never mind; but how any gentleman who has been in the service three\r\nmonths,--not to say three years,--can suppose Somerset House to be a\r\ndepartment, is beyond my comprehension. If you have been improperly\r\ninstructed--"\r\n\r\n"We shall know all about it another time," said Eames. "Mr. Love will\r\nmake a memorandum of it."\r\n\r\n"I shan\'t do anything of the kind," said Mr. Love.\r\n\r\n"If you have been wrongly instructed,--" Mr. Kissing began again,\r\nstealing a glance at Mr. Love as he did so; but at this moment\r\nthe door was again opened, and a messenger summoned Johnny to the\r\npresence of the really great man. "Mr. Eames, to wait upon Sir\r\nRaffle." Upon hearing this Johnny immediately started, and left Mr.\r\nKissing and the big book in possession of his desk. How the battle\r\nwas waged, and how it raged in the large room, we cannot stop to\r\nhear, as it is necessary that we should follow our hero into the\r\npresence of Sir Raffle Buffle.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Eames,--yes," said Sir Raffle, looking up from his desk when\r\nthe young man entered; "just wait half a minute, will you?" And\r\nthe knight went to work at his papers, as though fearing that any\r\ndelay in what he was doing might be very prejudicial to the nation\r\nat large. "Ah, Eames,--well,--yes," he said again, as he pushed\r\naway from him, almost with a jerk, the papers on which he had been\r\nwriting. "They tell me that you know the business of this office\r\npretty well."\r\n\r\n"Some of it, sir," said Eames.\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; some of it. But you\'ll have to understand the whole of it\r\nif you come to me. And you must be very sharp about it too. You know\r\nthat FitzHoward is leaving me?"\r\n\r\n"I have heard of it, sir."\r\n\r\n"A very excellent young man, though perhaps not-- But we won\'t mind\r\nthat. The work is a little too much for him, and he\'s going back into\r\nthe office. I believe Lord De Guest is a friend of yours; isn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; he is a friend of mine, certainly. He\'s been very kind to me."\r\n\r\n"Ah, well. I\'ve known the earl for many years,--for very many years;\r\nand intimately at one time. Perhaps you may have heard him mention my\r\nname?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have, Sir Raffle."\r\n\r\n"We were intimate once, but those things go off, you know. He\'s been\r\nthe country mouse and I\'ve been the town mouse. Ha, ha, ha! You may\r\ntell him that I say so. He won\'t mind that coming from me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; not at all," said Eames.\r\n\r\n"Mind you tell him when you see him. The earl is a man for whom I\'ve\r\nalways had a great respect,--a very great respect,--I may say regard.\r\nAnd now, Eames, what do you say to taking FitzHoward\'s place? The\r\nwork is hard. It is fair that I should tell you that. The work will,\r\nno doubt, be very hard. I take a greater share of what\'s going than\r\nmy predecessors have done; and I don\'t mind telling you that I have\r\nbeen sent here, because a man was wanted who would do that." The\r\nvoice of Sir Raffle, as he continued, became more and more harsh, and\r\nEames began to think how wise FitzHoward had been. "I mean to do my\r\nduty, and I shall expect that my private secretary will do his. But,\r\nMr. Eames, I never forget a man. Whether he be good or bad, I never\r\nforget a man. You don\'t dislike late hours, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Coming late to the office, you mean? Oh, no, not in the least."\r\n\r\n"Staying late,--staying late. Six or seven o\'clock if\r\nnecessary,--putting your shoulder to the wheel when the coach gets\r\ninto the mud. That\'s what I\'ve been doing all my life. They\'ve known\r\nwhat I am very well. They\'ve always kept me for the heavy roads. If\r\nthey paid, in the Civil Service, by the hour, I believe I should have\r\ndrawn a larger income than any man in it. If you take the vacant\r\nchair in the next room you\'ll find it\'s no joke. It\'s only fair that\r\nI should tell you that."\r\n\r\n"I can work as hard as any man," said Eames.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right. That\'s right. Stick to that and I\'ll stick to you.\r\nIt will be a great gratification to me to have by me a friend of\r\nmy old friend De Guest. Tell him I say so. And now you may as well\r\nget into harness at once. FitzHoward is there. You can go in to him,\r\nand at half-past four exactly I\'ll see you both. I\'m very exact,\r\nmind,--very;--and therefore you must be exact." Then Sir Raffle\r\nlooked as though he desired to be left alone.\r\n\r\n"Sir Raffle, there\'s one favour I want to ask of you," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"And what\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"I am most anxious to be absent for a fortnight or three weeks, just\r\nat Easter. I shall want to go in about ten days."\r\n\r\n"Absent for three weeks at Easter, when the parliamentary work is\r\nbeginning! That won\'t do for a private secretary."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s very important, Sir Raffle."\r\n\r\n"Out of the question, Eames; quite out of the question."\r\n\r\n"It\'s almost life and death to me."\r\n\r\n"Almost life and death. Why, what are you going to do?" With all his\r\ngrandeur and national importance, Sir Raffle would be very curious as\r\nto little people.\r\n\r\n"Well, I can\'t exactly tell you, and I\'m not quite sure myself."\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t talk nonsense. It\'s impossible that I should spare my\r\nprivate secretary just at that time of the year. I couldn\'t do it.\r\nThe service won\'t admit of it. You\'re not entitled to leave at that\r\nseason. Private secretaries always take their leave in the autumn."\r\n\r\n"I should like to be absent in the autumn too, but--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s out of the question, Mr. Eames."\r\n\r\nThen John Eames reflected that it behoved him in such an emergency to\r\nfire off his big gun. He had a great dislike to firing this big gun,\r\nbut, as he said to himself, there are occasions which make a big\r\ngun very necessary. "I got a letter from Lord De Guest this morning,\r\npressing me very much to go to him at Easter. It\'s about business,"\r\nadded Johnny. "If there was any difficulty, he said, he should write\r\nto you."\r\n\r\n"Write to me," said Sir Raffle, who did not like to be approached too\r\nfamiliarly in his office, even by an earl.\r\n\r\n"Of course I shouldn\'t tell him to do that. But, Sir Raffle, if I\r\nremained out there, in the office," and Johnny pointed towards the\r\nbig room with his head, "I could choose April for my month. And as\r\nthe matter is so important to me, and to the earl--"\r\n\r\n"What can it be?" said Sir Raffle.\r\n\r\n"It\'s quite private," said John Eames.\r\n\r\nHereupon Sir Raffle became very petulant, feeling that a bargain was\r\nbeing made with him. This young man would only consent to become his\r\nprivate secretary upon certain terms! "Well, go in to FitzHoward now.\r\nI can\'t lose all my day in this way."\r\n\r\n"But I shall be able to get away at Easter?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. We shall see about it. But don\'t stand talking there\r\nnow." Then John Eames went into FitzHoward\'s room, and received that\r\ngentleman\'s congratulations on his appointment. "I hope you like\r\nbeing rung for, like a servant, every minute, for he\'s always ringing\r\nthat bell. And he\'ll roar at you till you\'re deaf. You must give up\r\nall dinner engagements, for though there is not much to do, he\'ll\r\nnever let you go. I don\'t think anybody ever asks him out to dinner,\r\nfor he likes being here till seven. And you\'ll have to write all\r\nmanner of lies about big people. And, sometimes, when he has sent\r\nRafferty out about his private business, he\'ll ask you to bring him\r\nhis shoes." Now Rafferty was the First Commissioner\'s messenger.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that this little account was given by\r\nan outgoing and discomfited private secretary. "A man is not asked to\r\nbring another man his shoes," said Eames to himself, "until he shows\r\nhimself fit for that sort of business." Then he made within his own\r\nbreast a little resolution about Sir Raffle\'s shoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW PRIVATE SECRETARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Income-tax Office, April 8, 18--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR LORD DE GUEST,\r\n\r\n   I hardly know how to answer your letter, it is so very\r\n   kind--more than kind. And about not writing before,--I\r\n   must explain that I have not liked to trouble you with\r\n   letters. I should have seemed to be encroaching if I had\r\n   written much. Indeed it didn\'t come from not thinking\r\n   about you. And first of all, about the money,--as to your\r\n   offer, I mean. I really feel that I do not know what I\r\n   ought to say to you about it, without appearing to be a\r\n   simpleton. The truth is, I don\'t know what I ought to do,\r\n   and can only trust to you not to put me wrong. I have an\r\n   idea that a man ought not to accept a present of money,\r\n   unless from his father, or somebody like that. And the sum\r\n   you mention is so very large that it makes me wish you had\r\n   not named it. If you choose to be so generous, would it\r\n   not be better that you should leave it me in your will?\r\n\r\n\r\n"So that he might always want me to be dying," said Lord De Guest, as\r\nhe read the letter out loud to his sister.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure he wouldn\'t want that," said Lady Julia. "But you may live\r\nfor twenty-five years, you know."\r\n\r\n"Say fifty," said the earl. And then he continued the reading of his\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n\r\n   But all that depends so much upon another person, that it\r\n   is hardly worth while talking about it. Of course I am\r\n   very much obliged to Mr. Dale,--very much indeed,--and I\r\n   think that he is behaving very handsomely to his niece.\r\n   But whether it will do me any good, that is quite another\r\n   thing. However, I shall certainly accept your kind\r\n   invitation for Easter, and find out whether I have a\r\n   chance or not. I must tell you that Sir Raffle Buffle has\r\n   made me his private secretary, by which I get a hundred\r\n   a year. He says he was a great crony of yours many years\r\n   ago, and seems to like talking about you very much. You\r\n   will understand what all that means. He has sent you ever\r\n   so many messages, but I don\'t suppose you will care to get\r\n   them. I am to go to him to-morrow, and from all I hear I\r\n   shall have a hard time of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n"By George, he will," said the earl. "Poor fellow!"\r\n\r\n"But I thought a private secretary never had anything to do," said\r\nLady Julia.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t like to be private secretary to Sir Raffle, myself. But\r\nhe\'s young, and a hundred a year is a great thing. How we all of us\r\nused to hate that man. His voice sounded like a bell with a crack in\r\nit. We always used to be asking for some one to muffle the Buffle.\r\nThey call him Huffle Scuffle at his office. Poor Johnny!" Then he\r\nfinished the letter:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   I told him that I must have leave of absence at Easter,\r\n   and he at first declared that it was impossible. But I\r\n   shall carry my point about that. I would not stay away to\r\n   be made private secretary to the Prime Minister; and yet\r\n   I almost feel that I might as well stay away for any good\r\n   that I shall do.\r\n\r\n   Give my kind regards to Lady Julia, and tell her how very\r\n   much obliged to her I am. I cannot express the gratitude\r\n   which I owe to you. But pray believe me, my dear Lord De\r\n   Guest, always very faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n   JOHN EAMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was late before Eames had finished his letter. He had been making\r\nhimself ready for his exodus from the big room, and preparing his\r\ndesk and papers for his successor. About half-past five Cradell came\r\nup to him, and suggested that they should walk home together.\r\n\r\n"What! you here still?" said Eames. "I thought you always went at\r\nfour." Cradell had remained, hanging about the office, in order that\r\nhe might walk home with the new private secretary. But Eames did not\r\ndesire this. He had much of which he desired to think alone, and\r\nwould fain have been allowed to walk by himself.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I had things to do. I say, Johnny, I congratulate you most\r\nheartily; I do, indeed."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, old fellow!"\r\n\r\n"It is such a grand thing, you know. A hundred a year and all at\r\nonce! And then such a snug room to yourself,--and that fellow,\r\nKissing, never can come near you. He has been making himself such\r\na beast all day. But, Johnny, I always knew you\'d come to something\r\nmore than common. I always said so."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing uncommon about this; except that Fitz says that old\r\nHuffle Scuffle makes himself uncommon nasty."\r\n\r\n"Never mind what Fitz says. It\'s all jealousy. You\'ll have it all\r\nyour own way, if you look sharp. I think you always do have it all\r\nyour own way. Are you nearly ready?"\r\n\r\n"Well,--not quite. Don\'t wait for me, Caudle."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll wait. I don\'t mind waiting. They\'ll keep dinner for us if\r\nwe both stay. Besides, what matters? I\'d do more than that for you."\r\n\r\n"I have some idea of working on till eight, and having a chop sent\r\nin," said Johnny. "Besides--I\'ve got somewhere to call, by myself."\r\n\r\nThen Cradell almost cried. He remained silent for two or three\r\nminutes, striving to master his emotion; and at last, when he did\r\nspeak, had hardly succeeded in doing so. "Oh, Johnny," he said, "I\r\nknow what that means. You are going to throw me over because you\r\nare getting up in the world. I have always stuck to you, through\r\neverything; haven\'t I?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t make yourself a fool, Caudle."\r\n\r\n"Well; so I have. And if they had made me private secretary, I should\r\nhave been just the same to you as ever. You\'d have found no change in\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"What a goose you are. Do you say I\'m changed, because I want to dine\r\nin the city?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s all because you don\'t want to walk home with me, as we used to\r\ndo. I\'m not such a goose but what I can see. But, Johnny-- I suppose\r\nI mustn\'t call you Johnny, now."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be such a--con-founded--" Then Eames got up, and walked about\r\nthe room. "Come along," said he, "I don\'t care about staying, and\r\ndon\'t mind where I dine." And he bustled away with his hat and\r\ngloves, hardly giving Cradell time to catch him before he got out\r\ninto the streets. "I tell you what it is, Caudle," said he, "all that\r\nkind of thing is disgusting."\r\n\r\n"But how would you feel," whimpered Cradell, who had never succeeded\r\nin putting himself quite on a par with his friend, even in his own\r\nestimation, since that glorious victory at the railway station. If\r\nhe could only have thrashed Lupex as Johnny had thrashed Crosbie;\r\nthen indeed they might have been equal,--a pair of heroes. But he had\r\nnot done so. He had never told himself that he was a coward, but he\r\nconsidered that circumstances had been specially unkind to him. "But\r\nhow would you feel," he whimpered, "if the friend whom you liked\r\nbetter than anybody else in the world, turned his back upon you?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t turned my back upon you; except that I can\'t get you to\r\nwalk fast enough. Come along, old fellow, and don\'t talk confounded\r\nnonsense. I hate all that kind of thing. You never ought to suppose\r\nthat a man will give himself airs, but wait till he does. I don\'t\r\nbelieve I shall remain with old Scuffles above a month or two. From\r\nall that I can hear that\'s as much as any one can bear."\r\n\r\nThen Cradell by degrees became happy and cordial, and during the\r\nwhole walk flattered Eames with all the flattery of which he was\r\nmaster. And Johnny, though he did profess himself to be averse to\r\n"all that kind of thing," was nevertheless open to flattery. When\r\nCradell told him that though FitzHoward could not manage the Tartar\r\nknight, he might probably do so; he was inclined to believe what\r\nCradell said. "And as to getting him his shoes," said Cradell,\r\n"I don\'t suppose he\'d ever think of asking you to do such a thing,\r\nunless he was in a very great hurry, or something of that kind."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Johnny," said Cradell, as they got into one of the\r\nstreets bordering on Burton Crescent, "you know the last thing in the\r\nworld I should like to do would be to offend you."\r\n\r\n"All right, Caudle," said Eames, going on, whereas his companion had\r\nshown a tendency towards stopping.\r\n\r\n"Look here, now; if I have vexed you about Amelia Roper, I\'ll make\r\nyou a promise never to speak to her again."\r\n\r\n"D---- Amelia Roper," said Eames, suddenly stopping himself and\r\nstopping Cradell as well. The exclamation was made in a deep angry\r\nvoice which attracted the notice of one or two who were passing.\r\nJohnny was very wrong,--wrong to utter any curse;--very wrong to\r\nejaculate that curse against a human being; and especially wrong to\r\nfulminate it against a woman--a woman whom he had professed to love!\r\nBut he did do so, and I cannot tell my story thoroughly without\r\nrepeating the wicked word.\r\n\r\nCradell looked up at him and stared. "I only meant to say," said\r\nCradell, "I\'ll do anything you like in the matter."\r\n\r\n"Then never mention her name to me again. And as to talking to her,\r\nyou may talk to her till you\'re both blue in the face, if you\r\nplease."\r\n\r\n"Oh;--I didn\'t know. You didn\'t seem to like it the other day."\r\n\r\n"I was a fool the other day,--a confounded fool. And so I have been\r\nall my life. Amelia Roper! Look here, Caudle; if she makes up to you\r\nthis evening, as I\'ve no doubt she will, for she seems to be playing\r\nthat game constantly now, just let her have her fling. Never mind me;\r\nI\'ll amuse myself with Mrs. Lupex, or Miss Spruce."\r\n\r\n"But there\'ll be the deuce to pay with Mrs. Lupex. She\'s as cross as\r\npossible already whenever Amelia speaks to me. You don\'t know what a\r\njealous woman is, Johnny." Cradell had got upon what he considered\r\nto be his high ground. And on that he felt himself equal to any man.\r\nIt was no doubt true that Eames had thrashed a man, and that he had\r\nnot; it was true also that Eames had risen to very high place in the\r\nsocial world, having become a private secretary; but for a dangerous,\r\nmysterious, overwhelming, life-enveloping intrigue--was not he the\r\nacknowledged hero of such an affair? He had paid very dearly, both in\r\npocket and in comfort, for the blessing of Mrs. Lupex\'s society; but\r\nhe hardly considered that he had paid too dearly. There are certain\r\nluxuries which a man will find to be expensive; but, for all that,\r\nthey may be worth their price. Nevertheless as he went up the steps\r\nof Mrs. Roper\'s house he made up his mind that he would oblige his\r\nfriend. The intrigue might in that way become more mysterious, and\r\nmore life-enveloping; whereas it would not become more dangerous,\r\nseeing that Mr. Lupex could hardly find himself to be aggrieved by\r\nsuch a proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of Mrs. Roper\'s boarders were assembled at dinner\r\nthat day. Mr. Lupex seldom joined that festive board, but on this\r\noccasion he was present, appearing from his voice and manner to be\r\nin high good-humour. Cradell had communicated to the company in the\r\ndrawing-room the great good fortune which had fallen upon his friend,\r\nand Johnny had thereby become the mark of a certain amount of\r\nhero-worship.\r\n\r\n"Oh, indeed!" said Mrs. Roper. "An \'appy woman your mother will be\r\nwhen she hears it. But I always said you\'d come down right side\r\nuppermost."\r\n\r\n"Handsome is as handsome does," said Miss Spruce.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Eames!" exclaimed Mrs. Lupex, with graceful enthusiasm, "I\r\nwish you joy from the very depth of my heart. It is such an elegant\r\nappointment."\r\n\r\n"Accept the hand of a true and disinterested friend," said Lupex. And\r\nJohnny did accept the hand, though it was very dirty and stained all\r\nover with paint.\r\n\r\nAmelia stood apart and conveyed her congratulations by a glance,--or,\r\nI might better say, by a series of glances. "And now,--now will you\r\nnot be mine," the glances said; "now that you are rolling in wealth\r\nand prosperity?" And then before they went downstairs she did whisper\r\none word to him. "Oh, I am so happy, John;--so very happy."\r\n\r\n"Bother!" said Johnny, in a tone quite loud enough to reach the\r\nlady\'s ear. Then making his way round the room, he gave his arm to\r\nMiss Spruce. Amelia, as she walked downstairs alone, declared to\r\nherself that she would wring his heart. She had been employed in\r\nwringing it for some days past, and had been astonished at her own\r\nsuccess. It had been clear enough to her that Eames had been piqued\r\nby her overtures to Cradell, and she had therefore to play out that\r\ngame.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Cradell," she said, as she took her seat next to him. "The\r\nfriends I like are the friends that remain always the same. I hate\r\nyour sudden rises. They do so often make a man upsetting."\r\n\r\n"I should like to try, myself, all the same," said Cradell.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t think it would make any difference in you; I don\'t\r\nindeed. And of course your time will come too. It\'s that earl as has\r\ndone it,--he that was worried by the bull. Since we have known an\r\nearl we have been so mighty fine." And Amelia gave her head a little\r\ntoss, and then smiled archly, in a manner which, to Cradell\'s eyes,\r\nwas really very becoming. But he saw that Mrs. Lupex was looking at\r\nhim from the other side of the table, and he could not quite enjoy\r\nthe goods which the gods had provided for him.\r\n\r\nWhen the ladies left the dining-room Lupex and the two young men drew\r\ntheir chairs near the fire, and each prepared for himself a moderate\r\npotation. Eames made a little attempt at leaving the room, but he\r\nwas implored by Lupex with such earnest protestations of friendship\r\nto remain, and was so weakly fearful of being charged with giving\r\nhimself airs, that he did as he was desired.\r\n\r\n"And here, Mr. Eames, is to your very good health," said Lupex,\r\nraising to his mouth a steaming goblet of gin-and-water, "and wishing\r\nyou many years to enjoy your official prosperity."\r\n\r\n"Thank ye," said Eames. "I don\'t know much about the prosperity, but\r\nI\'m just as much obliged."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; when I see a young man of your age beginning to rise\r\nin the world, I know he\'ll go on. Now look at me, Mr. Eames. Mr.\r\nCradell, here\'s your very good health, and may all unkindness be\r\ndrowned in the flowing bowl-- Look at me, Mr. Eames. I\'ve never\r\nrisen in the world; I\'ve never done any good in the world, and never\r\nshall."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Lupex, don\'t say that."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but I do say it. I\'ve always been pulling the devil by the tail,\r\nand never yet got as much as a good hold on to that. And I\'ll tell\r\nyou why; I never got a chance when I was young. If I could have got\r\nany big fellow, a star, you know, to let me paint his portrait when I\r\nwas your age,--such a one, let us say, as your friend Sir Raffle--"\r\n\r\n"What a star!" said Cradell.\r\n\r\n"Well, I suppose he\'s pretty much known in the world, isn\'t he? Or\r\nLord Derby, or Mr. Spurgeon. You know what I mean. If I\'d got such a\r\nchance as that when I was young, I should never have been doing jobs\r\nof scene-painting at the minor theatres at so much a square yard.\r\nYou\'ve got the chance now, but I never had it."\r\n\r\nWhereupon Mr. Lupex finished his first measure of gin-and-water.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a very queer thing,--life is," continued Lupex; and, though\r\nhe did not at once go to work boldly at the mixing of another glass\r\nof toddy, he began gradually, and as if by instinct, to finger the\r\nthings which would be necessary for that operation. "A very queer\r\nthing. Now, remember, young gentlemen, I\'m not denying that success\r\nin life will depend upon good conduct;--of course it does; but, then,\r\nhow often good conduct comes from success! Should I have been what I\r\nam now, do you suppose, if some big fellow had taken me by the hand\r\nwhen I was struggling to make an artist of myself? I could have drunk\r\nclaret and champagne just as well as gin-and-water, and worn ruffles\r\nto my shirt as gracefully as many a fellow who used to be very fond\r\nof me, and now won\'t speak to me if he meets me in the streets. I\r\nnever got a chance,--never."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s not too late yet, Mr. Lupex," said Eames.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is, Eames,--yes, it is." And now Mr. Lupex had grasped the\r\ngin-bottle. "It\'s too late now. The game\'s over, and the match is\r\nlost. The talent is here. I\'m as sure of that now as ever I was. I\'ve\r\nnever doubted my own ability,--never for a moment. There are men this\r\nvery day making a thousand a year off their easels who haven\'t so\r\ngood and true an eye in drawing as I have, or so good a feeling in\r\ncolours. I could name them; only I won\'t."\r\n\r\n"And why shouldn\'t you try again?" said Eames.\r\n\r\n"If I were to paint the finest piece that ever delighted the eye of\r\nman, who would come and look at it? Who would have enough belief in\r\nme to come as far as this place and see if it were true? No, Eames;\r\nI know my own position and my own ways, and I know my own weakness.\r\nI couldn\'t do a day\'s work now, unless I were certain of getting a\r\ncertain number of shillings at the end of it. That\'s what a man comes\r\nto when things have gone against him."\r\n\r\n"But I thought men got lots of money by scene-painting?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you may call lots, Mr. Cradell; I don\'t call it\r\nlots. But I\'m not complaining. I know who I have to thank; and if\r\never I blow my own brains out I shan\'t be putting the blame on the\r\nwrong shoulders. If you\'ll take my advice,"--and now he turned round\r\nto Eames,--"you\'ll beware of marrying too soon in life."\r\n\r\n"I think a man should marry early, if he marries well," said Eames.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t misunderstand me," continued Lupex. "It isn\'t about Mrs. L.\r\nI\'m speaking. I\'ve always regarded my wife as a very fascinating\r\nwoman."\r\n\r\n"Hear, hear, hear!" said Cradell, thumping the table.\r\n\r\n"Indeed she is," said Eames.\r\n\r\n"And when I caution you against marrying, don\'t you misunderstand me.\r\nI\'ve never said a word against her to any man, and never will. If a\r\nman don\'t stand by his wife, whom will he stand by? I blame no one\r\nbut myself. But I do say this; I never had a chance;--I never had a\r\nchance;--never had a chance." And as he repeated the words for the\r\nthird time, his lips were already fixed to the rim of his tumbler.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door of the dining-room was opened, and Mrs. Lupex\r\nput in her head.\r\n\r\n"Lupex," she said, "what are you doing?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear. I can\'t say I\'m doing anything at the present moment.\r\nI was giving a little advice to these young gentlemen."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Cradell, I wonder at you. And, Mr. Eames, I wonder at you,\r\ntoo,--in your position! Lupex, come upstairs at once." She then\r\nstepped into the room and secured the gin-bottle.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Cradell, do come here," said Amelia, in her liveliest tone,\r\nas soon as the men made their appearance above. "I\'ve been waiting\r\nfor you this half-hour. I\'ve got such a puzzle for you." And she\r\nmade way for him to a chair which was between herself and the wall.\r\nCradell looked half afraid of his fortunes as he took the proffered\r\nseat; but he did take it, and was soon secured from any positive\r\nphysical attack by the strength and breadth of Miss Roper\'s\r\ncrinoline.\r\n\r\n"Dear me! Here\'s a change," said Mrs. Lupex, out loud.\r\n\r\nJohnny Eames was standing close, and whispered into her ear, "Changes\r\nare so pleasant sometimes! Don\'t you think so? I do."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nNEMESIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrosbie had now settled down to the calm realities of married life,\r\nand was beginning to think that the odium was dying away which for\r\na week or two had attached itself to him, partly on account of his\r\nusage of Miss Dale, but more strongly in consequence of the thrashing\r\nwhich he had received from John Eames. Not that he had in any way\r\nrecovered his former tone of life, or that he ever hoped to do so.\r\nBut he was able to go in and out of his club without embarrassment.\r\nHe could talk with his wonted voice, and act with his wonted\r\nauthority at his office. He could tell his friends, with some little\r\ndegree of pleasure in the sound, that Lady Alexandrina would be very\r\nhappy to see them. And he could make himself comfortable in his own\r\nchair after dinner, with his slippers and his newspaper. He could\r\nmake himself comfortable, or at any rate could tell his wife that he\r\ndid so.\r\n\r\nIt was very dull. He was obliged to acknowledge to himself, when he\r\nthought over the subject, that the life which he was leading was\r\ndull. Though he could go into his club without annoyance, nobody\r\nthere ever thought of asking him to join them at dinner. It was taken\r\nfor granted that he was going to dine at home; and in the absence of\r\nany provocation to the contrary, he always did dine at home. He had\r\nnow been in his house for three weeks, and had been asked with his\r\nwife to a few bridal dinner-parties, given chiefly by friends of the\r\nDe Courcy family. Except on such occasions he never passed an evening\r\nout of his own house, and had not yet, since his marriage, dined once\r\naway from his wife. He told himself that his good conduct in this\r\nrespect was the result of his own resolution; but, nevertheless, he\r\nfelt that there was nothing else left for him to do. Nobody asked\r\nhim to go to the theatre. Nobody begged him to drop in of an evening.\r\nMen never asked him why he did not play a rubber. He would generally\r\nsaunter into Sebright\'s after he left his office, and lounge about\r\nthe room for half an hour, talking to a few men. Nobody was uncivil\r\nto him. But he knew that the whole thing was changed, and he\r\nresolved, with some wisdom, to accommodate himself to his altered\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nLady Alexandrina also found her new life rather dull, and was\r\nsometimes inclined to be a little querulous. She would tell her\r\nhusband that she never got out, and would declare, when he offered to\r\nwalk with her, that she did not care for walking in the streets. "I\r\ndon\'t exactly see, then, where you are to walk," he once replied. She\r\ndid not tell him that she was fond of riding, and that the Park was\r\na very fitting place for such exercise; but she looked it, and he\r\nunderstood her. "I\'ll do all I can for her," he said to himself; "but\r\nI\'ll not ruin myself." "Amelia is coming to take me for a drive," she\r\nsaid another time. "Ah, that\'ll be very nice," he answered. "No; it\r\nwon\'t be very nice," said Alexandrina. "Amelia is always shopping and\r\nbargaining with the tradespeople. But it will be better than being\r\nkept in the house without ever stirring out."\r\n\r\nThey breakfasted nominally at half-past nine; in truth, it was always\r\nnearly ten, as Lady Alexandrina found it difficult to get herself\r\nout of her room. At half-past ten punctually he left his house for\r\nhis office. He usually got home by six, and then spent the greatest\r\npart of the hour before dinner in the ceremony of dressing. He went,\r\nat least, into his dressing-room, after speaking a few words to his\r\nwife, and there remained, pulling things about, clipping his nails,\r\nlooking over any paper that came in his way, and killing the time. He\r\nexpected his dinner punctually at seven, and began to feel a little\r\ncross if he were kept waiting. After dinner, he drank one glass of\r\nwine in company with his wife, and one other by himself, during which\r\nlatter ceremony he would stare at the hot coals, and think of the\r\nthing he had done. Then he would go upstairs, and have, first a cup\r\nof coffee, and then a cup of tea. He would read his newspaper, open\r\na book or two, hide his face when he yawned, and try to make believe\r\nthat he liked it. She had no signs or words of love for him. She\r\nnever sat on his knee, or caressed him. She never showed him that any\r\nhappiness had come to her in being allowed to live close to him. They\r\nthought that they loved each other:--each thought so; but there was\r\nno love, no sympathy, no warmth. The very atmosphere was cold;--so\r\ncold that no fire could remove the chill.\r\n\r\nIn what way would it have been different had Lily Dale sat opposite\r\nto him there as his wife, instead of Lady Alexandrina? He told\r\nhimself frequently that either with one or with the other life would\r\nhave been the same; that he had made himself for a while unfit for\r\ndomestic life, and that he must cure himself of that unfitness.\r\nBut though he declared this to himself in one set of half-spoken\r\nthoughts, he would also declare to himself in another set, that Lily\r\nwould have made the whole house bright with her brightness; that\r\nhad he brought her home to his hearth, there would have been a sun\r\nshining on him every morning and every evening. But, nevertheless, he\r\nstrove to do his duty, and remembered that the excitement of official\r\nlife was still open to him. From eleven in the morning till five in\r\nthe afternoon he could still hold a position which made it necessary\r\nthat men should regard him with respect, and speak to him with\r\ndeference. In this respect he was better off than his wife, for she\r\nhad no office to which she could betake herself.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said to Amelia, "it is all very nice, and I don\'t mind the\r\nhouse being damp; but I get so tired of being alone."\r\n\r\n"That must be the case with women who are married to men of\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t complain. Of course I knew what I was about. I suppose\r\nit won\'t be so very dull when everybody is up in London."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t find the season makes much difference to us after\r\nChristmas," said Amelia; "but no doubt London is gayer in May. You\'ll\r\nfind you\'ll like it better next year; and perhaps you\'ll have a baby,\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\n"Psha!" ejaculated Lady Alexandrina; "I don\'t want a baby, and don\'t\r\nsuppose I shall have one."\r\n\r\n"It\'s always something to do, you know."\r\n\r\nLady Alexandrina, though she was not of an energetic temperament,\r\ncould not but confess to herself that she had made a mistake. She had\r\nbeen tempted to marry Crosbie because Crosbie was a man of fashion,\r\nand now she was told that the London season would make no difference\r\nto her;--the London season which had hitherto always brought to her\r\nthe excitement of parties, if it had not given her the satisfaction\r\nof amusement. She had been tempted to marry because it appeared to\r\nher that a married woman could enjoy society with less restraint than\r\na girl who was subject to her mother or her chaperon; that she would\r\nhave more freedom of action as a married woman; and now she was told\r\nthat she must wait for a baby before she could have anything to do.\r\nCourcy Castle was sometimes dull, but Courcy Castle would have been\r\nbetter than this.\r\n\r\nWhen Crosbie returned home after this little conversation about\r\nthe baby, he was told by his wife that they were to dine with the\r\nGazebees on the next Sunday. On hearing this he shook his head with\r\nvexation. He knew, however, that he had no right to make complaint,\r\nas he had been only taken to St. John\'s Wood once since they had come\r\nhome from their marriage trip. There was, however, one point as to\r\nwhich he could grumble. "Why, on earth, on Sunday?"\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: "Why, on earth, on Sunday?"]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Because Amelia asked me for Sunday. If you are asked for Sunday, you\r\ncannot say you\'ll go on Monday."\r\n\r\n"It is so terrible on a Sunday afternoon. At what hour?"\r\n\r\n"She said half-past five."\r\n\r\n"Heavens and earth! What are we to do all the evening?"\r\n\r\n"It is not kind of you, Adolphus, to speak in that way of my\r\nrelations."\r\n\r\n"Come, my love, that\'s a joke; as if I hadn\'t heard you say the same\r\nthing twenty times. You\'ve complained of having to go up there much\r\nmore bitterly than I ever did. You know I like your sister, and,\r\nin his way, Gazebee is a very good fellow; but after three or four\r\nhours, one begins to have had enough of him."\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be much duller than it is--;" but Lady Alexandrina stopped\r\nherself before she finished her speech.\r\n\r\n"One can always read at home, at any rate," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"One can\'t always be reading. However, I have said you would go. If\r\nyou choose to refuse, you must write and explain."\r\n\r\nWhen the Sunday came the Crosbies of course did go to St. John\'s\r\nWood, arriving punctually at that door which he so hated at half-past\r\nfive. One of the earliest resolutions which he made when he first\r\ncontemplated the De Courcy match, was altogether hostile to the\r\nGazebees. He would see but very little of them. He would shake\r\nhimself free of that connexion. It was not with that branch of the\r\nfamily that he desired an alliance. But now, as things had gone, that\r\nwas the only branch of the family with which he seemed to be allied.\r\nHe was always hearing of the Gazebees. Amelia and Alexandrina were\r\nconstantly together. He was now dragged there to a Sunday dinner;\r\nand he knew that he should often be dragged there,--that he could\r\nnot avoid such draggings. He already owed money to Mortimer Gazebee,\r\nand was aware that his affairs had been allowed to fall into that\r\nlawyer\'s hands in such a way that he could not take them out again.\r\nHis house was very thoroughly furnished, and he knew that the bills\r\nhad been paid; but he had not paid them; every shilling had been paid\r\nthrough Mortimer Gazebee.\r\n\r\n"Go with your mother and aunt, De Courcy," the attorney said to the\r\nlingering child after dinner; and then Crosbie was left alone with\r\nhis wife\'s brother-in-law. This was the period of the St. John\'s\r\nWood purgatory which was so dreadful to him. With his sister-in-law\r\nhe could talk, remembering perhaps always that she was an earl\'s\r\ndaughter. But with Gazebee he had nothing in common. And he felt\r\nthat Gazebee, who had once treated him with great deference, had now\r\nlost all such feeling. Crosbie had once been a man of fashion in\r\nthe estimation of the attorney, but that was all over. Crosbie, in\r\nthe attorney\'s estimation, was now simply the secretary of a public\r\noffice,--a man who owed him money. The two had married sisters, and\r\nthere was no reason why the light of the prosperous attorney should\r\npale before that of the civil servant, who was not very prosperous.\r\nAll this was understood thoroughly by both the men.\r\n\r\n"There\'s terrible bad news from Courcy," said the attorney, as soon\r\nas the boy was gone.\r\n\r\n"Why; what\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Porlock has married--that woman, you know."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense."\r\n\r\n"He has. The old lady has been obliged to tell me, and she\'s nearly\r\nbroken-hearted about it. But that\'s not the worst of it to my mind.\r\nAll the world knows that Porlock had gone to the mischief. But he is\r\ngoing to bring an action against his father for some arrears of his\r\nallowance, and he threatens to have everything out in court, if he\r\ndoesn\'t get his money."\r\n\r\n"But is there money due to him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, there is. A couple of thousand pounds or so. I suppose I shall\r\nhave to find it. But, upon my honour, I don\'t know where it\'s to come\r\nfrom; I don\'t, indeed. In one way or another, I\'ve paid over fourteen\r\nhundred pounds for you."\r\n\r\n"Fourteen hundred pounds!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed;--what with the insurance and the furniture, and the\r\nbill from our house for the settlements. That\'s not paid yet, but\r\nit\'s the same thing. A man doesn\'t get married for nothing, I can\r\ntell you."\r\n\r\n"But you\'ve got security."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I\'ve got security. But the thing is the ready money. Our\r\nhouse has advanced so much on the Courcy property, that they don\'t\r\nlike going any further; and therefore it is that I have to do this\r\nmyself. They\'ll all have to go abroad,--that\'ll be the end of it.\r\nThere\'s been such a scene between the earl and George. George lost\r\nhis temper and told the earl that Porlock\'s marriage was his fault.\r\nIt has ended in George with his wife being turned out."\r\n\r\n"He has money of his own."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but he won\'t spend it. He\'s coming up here, and we shall find\r\nhim hanging about us. I don\'t mean to give him a bed here, and I\r\nadvise you not to do so either. You\'ll not get rid of him if you do."\r\n\r\n"I have the greatest possible dislike to him."\r\n\r\n"Yes; he\'s a bad fellow. So is John. Porlock was the best, but he\'s\r\ngone altogether to ruin. They\'ve made a nice mess of it between them;\r\nhaven\'t they?"\r\n\r\nThis was the family for whose sake Crosbie had jilted Lily Dale!\r\nHis single and simple ambition had been that of being an earl\'s\r\nson-in-law. To achieve that it had been necessary that he should\r\nmake himself a villain. In achieving it he had gone through all\r\nmanner of dirt and disgrace. He had married a woman whom he knew he\r\ndid not love. He was thinking almost hourly of a girl whom he had\r\nloved, whom he did love, but whom he had so injured, that, under\r\nno circumstances, could he be allowed to speak to her again. The\r\nattorney there--who sat opposite to him, talking about his thousands\r\nof pounds with that disgusting assumed solicitude which such men put\r\non, when they know very well what they are doing--had made a similar\r\nmarriage. But he had known what he was about. He had got from his\r\nmarriage all that he had expected. But what had Crosbie got?\r\n\r\n"They\'re a bad set,--a bad set," said he in his bitterness.\r\n\r\n"The men are," said Gazebee, very comfortably.\r\n\r\n"H--m," said Crosbie. It was manifest to Gazebee that his friend was\r\nexpressing a feeling that the women, also, were not all that they\r\nshould be, but he took no offence, though some portion of the censure\r\nmight thereby be supposed to attach to his own wife.\r\n\r\n"The countess means well," said Gazebee. "But she\'s had a hard life\r\nof it,--a very hard life. I\'ve heard him call her names that would\r\nfrighten a coal-heaver. I have, indeed. But he\'ll die soon, and then\r\nshe\'ll be comfortable. She has three thousand a year jointure."\r\n\r\nHe\'ll die soon, and then she\'ll be comfortable! That was one phase of\r\nmarried life. As Crosbie\'s mind dwelt upon the words, he remembered\r\nLily\'s promise made in the fields, that she would do everything for\r\nhim. He remembered her kisses; the touch of her fingers; the low\r\nsilvery laughing voice; the feel of her dress as she would press\r\nclose to him. After that he reflected whether it would not be well\r\nthat he too should die, so that Alexandrina might be comfortable. She\r\nand her mother might be very comfortable together, with plenty of\r\nmoney, at Baden-Baden!\r\n\r\nThe squire at Allington, and Mrs. Dale, and Lady Julia De Guest, had\r\nbeen, and still were, uneasy in their minds because no punishment had\r\nfallen upon Crosbie,--no vengeance had overtaken him in consequence\r\nof his great sin. How little did they know about it! Could he have\r\nbeen prosecuted and put into prison, with hard labour, for twelve\r\nmonths, the punishment would not have been heavier. He would, in that\r\ncase, at any rate, have been saved from Lady Alexandrina.\r\n\r\n"George and his wife are coming up to town; couldn\'t we ask them to\r\ncome to us for a week or so?" said his wife to him, as soon as they\r\nwere in the fly together, going home.\r\n\r\n"No," shouted Crosbie; "we will do no such thing." There was not\r\nanother word said on the subject,--nor on any other subject till they\r\ngot home. When they reached their house Alexandrina had a headache,\r\nand went up to her room immediately. Crosbie threw himself into a\r\nchair before the remains of a fire in the dining-room, and resolved\r\nthat he would cut the whole De Courcy family altogether. His wife, as\r\nhis wife, should obey him. She should obey him--or else leave him and\r\ngo her way by herself, leaving him to go his way. There was an income\r\nof twelve hundred a year. Would it not be a fine thing for him if he\r\ncould keep six hundred for himself and return to his old manner of\r\nlife. All his old comforts of course he would not have,--nor the old\r\nesteem and regard of men. But the luxury of a club dinner he might\r\nenjoy. Unembarrassed evenings might be his,--with liberty to him to\r\npass them as he pleased. He knew many men who were separated from\r\ntheir wives, and who seemed to be as happy as their neighbours.\r\nAnd then he remembered how ugly Alexandrina had been this evening,\r\nwearing a great tinsel coronet full of false stones, with a cold in\r\nher head which had reddened her nose. There had, too, fallen upon\r\nher in these her married days a certain fixed dreary dowdiness.\r\nShe certainly was very plain! So he said to himself, and then he\r\nwent to bed. I myself am inclined to think that his punishment was\r\nsufficiently severe.\r\n\r\nThe next morning his wife still complained of headache, so that he\r\nbreakfasted alone. Since that positive refusal which he had given to\r\nher proposition for inviting her brother, there had not been much\r\nconversation between them. "My head is splitting, and Sarah shall\r\nbring some tea and toast up to me, if you will not mind it."\r\n\r\nHe did not mind it in the least, and ate his breakfast by himself,\r\nwith more enjoyment than usually attended that meal.\r\n\r\nIt was clear to him that all the present satisfaction of his life\r\nmust come to him from his office work. There are men who find it\r\ndifficult to live without some source of daily comfort, and he was\r\nsuch a man. He could hardly endure his life unless there were some\r\npage in it on which he could look with gratified eyes. He had always\r\nliked his work, and he now determined that he would like it better\r\nthan ever. But in order that he might do so it was necessary that\r\nhe should have much of his own way. According to the theory of his\r\noffice, it was incumbent on him as Secretary simply to take the\r\norders of the Commissioners, and see that they were executed; and to\r\nsuch work as this his predecessor had strictly confined himself. But\r\nhe had already done more than this, and had conceived the ambition\r\nof holding the Board almost under his thumb. He flattered himself\r\nthat he knew his own work and theirs better than they knew either,\r\nand that by a little management he might be their master. It is not\r\nimpossible that such might have been the case had there been no\r\nfracas at the Paddington station; but, as we all know, the dominant\r\ncock of the farmyard must be ever dominant. When he shall once have\r\nhad his wings so smeared with mud as to give him even the appearance\r\nof adversity, no other cock will ever respect him again. Mr. Optimist\r\nand Mr. Butterwell knew very well that their secretary had been\r\ncudgelled, and they could not submit themselves to a secretary who\r\nhad been so treated.\r\n\r\n"Oh, by-the-by, Crosbie," said Butterwell, coming into his room,\r\nsoon after his arrival at his office on that day of his solitary\r\nbreakfast, "I want to say just a few words to you." And Butterwell\r\nturned round and closed the door, the lock of which had not\r\npreviously been fastened. Crosbie, without much thinking, immediately\r\nforetold himself the nature of the coming conversation.\r\n\r\n"Do you know--" said Butterwell, beginning.\r\n\r\n"Sit down, won\'t you?" said Crosbie, seating himself as he spoke. If\r\nthere was to be a contest, he would make the best fight he could.\r\nHe would show a better spirit here than he had done on the railway\r\nplatform. Butterwell did sit down, and felt as he did so, that the\r\nvery motion of sitting took away some of his power. He ought to\r\nhave sent for Crosbie into his own room. A man, when he wishes\r\nto reprimand another, should always have the benefit of his own\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to find any fault," Butterwell began.\r\n\r\n"I hope you have not any cause," said Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"No, no; I don\'t say that I have. But we think at the Board--"\r\n\r\n"Stop, stop, Butterwell. If anything unpleasant is coming, it had\r\nbetter come from the Board. I should take it in better spirit; I\r\nshould, indeed."\r\n\r\n"What takes place at the Board must be official."\r\n\r\n"I shall not mind that in the least. I should rather like it than\r\notherwise."\r\n\r\n"It simply amounts to this,--that we think you are taking a little\r\ntoo much on yourself. No doubt, it\'s a fault on the right side, and\r\narises from your wishing to have the work well done."\r\n\r\n"And if I don\'t do it, who will?" asked Crosbie.\r\n\r\n"The Board is very well able to get through all that appertains to\r\nit. Come, Crosbie, you and I have known each other a great many\r\nyears, and it would be a pity that we should have any words. I have\r\ncome to you in this way because it would be disagreeable to you to\r\nhave any question raised officially. Optimist isn\'t given to being\r\nvery angry, but he was downright angry yesterday. You had better take\r\nwhat I say in good part, and go along a little quieter."\r\n\r\nBut Crosbie was not in a humour to take anything quietly. He was sore\r\nall over, and prone to hit out at everybody that he met. "I have done\r\nmy duty to the best of my ability, Mr. Butterwell," he said, "and I\r\nbelieve I have done it well. I believe I know my duty here as well\r\nas any one can teach me. If I have done more than my share of work,\r\nit is because other people have done less than theirs." As he spoke,\r\nthere was a black cloud upon his brow, and the Commissioner could\r\nperceive that the Secretary was very wrathful.\r\n\r\n"Oh! very well," said Butterwell, rising from his chair. "I can only,\r\nunder such circumstances, speak to the Chairman, and he will tell you\r\nwhat he thinks at the Board. I think you\'re foolish; I do, indeed. As\r\nfor myself, I have only meant to act kindly by you." After that, Mr.\r\nButterwell took himself off.\r\n\r\nOn the same afternoon, Crosbie was summoned into the Board-room in\r\nthe usual way, between two and three. This was a daily occurrence,\r\nas he always sat for about an hour with two out of the three\r\nCommissioners, after they had fortified themselves with a biscuit\r\nand a glass of sherry. On the present occasion, the usual amount of\r\nbusiness was transacted, but it was done in a manner which made\r\nCrosbie feel that they did not all stand together on their usual\r\nfooting. The three Commissioners were all there. The Chairman gave\r\nhis directions in a solemn, pompous voice, which was by no means\r\nusual to him when he was in good humour. The Major said little\r\nor nothing; but there was a gleam of satisfied sarcasm in his\r\neye. Things were going wrong at the Board, and he was pleased. Mr.\r\nButterwell was exceedingly civil in his demeanour, and rather more\r\nthan ordinarily brisk. As soon as the regular work of the day was\r\nover, Mr. Optimist shuffled about on his chair, rising from his seat,\r\nand then sitting down again. He looked through a lot of papers close\r\nto his hand, peering at them over his spectacles. Then he selected\r\none, took off his spectacles, leaned back in his chair, and began his\r\nlittle speech.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Crosbie," he said, "we are all very much gratified,--very much\r\ngratified, indeed,--by your zeal and energy in the service."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir," said Crosbie; "I am fond of the service."\r\n\r\n"Exactly, exactly; we all feel that. But we think that you,--if I\r\nwere to say take too much upon yourself, I should say, perhaps, more\r\nthan we mean."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say more than you mean, Mr. Optimist." Crosbie\'s eyes, as he\r\nspoke, gleamed slightly with his momentary triumph; as did also those\r\nof Major Fiasco.\r\n\r\n"No, no, no," said Mr. Optimist; "I would say rather less than more\r\nto so very good a public servant as yourself. But you, doubtless,\r\nunderstand me?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I do quite, sir. If I have not taken too much on me,\r\nwhat is it that I have done that I ought not to have done?"\r\n\r\n"You have given directions in many cases for which you ought first to\r\nhave received authority. Here is an instance," and the selected paper\r\nwas at once brought out.\r\n\r\nIt was a matter in which the Secretary had been manifestly wrong\r\naccording to written law, and he could not defend it on its own\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\n"If you wish me," said he, "to confine myself exactly to the positive\r\ninstructions of the office, I will do so; but I think you will find\r\nit inconvenient."\r\n\r\n"It will be far the best," said Mr. Optimist.\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Mr. Crosbie, "it shall be done." And he at once\r\ndetermined to make himself as unpleasant to the three gentlemen in\r\nthe room as he might find it within his power to do. He could make\r\nhimself very unpleasant, but the unpleasantness would be as much to\r\nhim as to them.\r\n\r\nNothing would now go right with him. He could look in no direction\r\nfor satisfaction. He sauntered into Sebright\'s, as he went home, but\r\nhe could not find words to speak to any one about the little matters\r\nof the day. He went home, and his wife, though she was up, complained\r\nstill of her headache.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t been out of the house all day," she said, "and that has\r\nmade it worse."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how you are to get out if you won\'t walk," he answered.\r\n\r\nThen there was no more said between them till they sat down to their\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\nHad the squire at Allington known all, he might, I think, have been\r\nsatisfied with the punishment which Crosbie had encountered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR GOING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: (untitled)]\r\n\r\n"Mamma, read that letter."\r\n\r\nIt was Mrs. Dale\'s eldest daughter who spoke to her, and they were\r\nalone together in the parlour at the Small House. Mrs. Dale took the\r\nletter and read it very carefully. She then put it back into its\r\nenvelope and returned it to Bell.\r\n\r\n"It is, at any rate, a good letter, and, as I believe, tells the\r\ntruth."\r\n\r\n"I think it tells a little more than the truth, mamma. As you say,\r\nit is a well-written letter. He always writes well when he is in\r\nearnest. But yet--"\r\n\r\n"Yet what, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"There is more head than heart in it."\r\n\r\n"If so, he will suffer the less; that is, if you are quite resolved\r\nin the matter."\r\n\r\n"I am quite resolved, and I do not think he will suffer much. He\r\nwould not, I suppose, have taken the trouble to write like that, if\r\nhe did not wish this thing."\r\n\r\n"I am quite sure that he does wish it, most earnestly; and that he\r\nwill be greatly disappointed."\r\n\r\n"As he would be if any other scheme did not turn out to his\r\nsatisfaction; that is all."\r\n\r\nThe letter, of course, was from Bell\'s cousin Bernard, and containing\r\nthe strongest plea he was able to make in favour of his suit for her\r\nhand. Bernard Dale was better able to press such a plea by letter\r\nthan by spoken words. He was a man capable of doing anything well in\r\nthe doing of which a little time for consideration might be given to\r\nhim; but he had not in him that power of passion which will force\r\na man to eloquence in asking for that which he desires to obtain.\r\nHis letter on this occasion was long, and well argued. If there was\r\nlittle in it of passionate love, there was much of pleasant flattery.\r\nHe told Bell how advantageous to both their families their marriage\r\nwould be; he declared to her that his own feeling in the matter had\r\nbeen rendered stronger by absence; he alluded without boasting to his\r\npast career of life as her best guarantee for his future conduct; he\r\nexplained to her that if this marriage could be arranged there need\r\nthen, at any rate, be no further question as to his aunt removing\r\nwith Lily from the Small House; and then he told her that his\r\naffection for herself was the absorbing passion of his existence.\r\nHad the letter been written with the view of obtaining from a third\r\nperson a favourable verdict as to his suit, it would have been a very\r\ngood letter indeed; but there was not a word in it that could stir\r\nthe heart of such a girl as Bell Dale.\r\n\r\n"Answer him kindly," Mrs. Dale said.\r\n\r\n"As kindly as I know how," said Bell. "I wish you would write the\r\nletter, mamma."\r\n\r\n"I fear that would not do. What I should say would only tempt him to\r\ntry again."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale knew very well,--had known for some months past,--that\r\nBernard\'s suit was hopeless. She felt certain, although the matter\r\nhad not been discussed between them, that whenever Dr. Crofts might\r\nchoose to come again and ask for her daughter\'s hand he would not be\r\nrefused. Of the two men she probably liked Dr. Crofts the best; but\r\nshe liked them both, and she could not but remember that the one,\r\nin a worldly point of view, would be a very poor match, whereas the\r\nother would, in all respects, be excellent. She would not, on any\r\naccount, say a word to influence her daughter, and knew, moreover,\r\nthat no word which she could say would influence her; but she could\r\nnot divest herself of some regret that it should be so.\r\n\r\n"I know what you would wish, mamma," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"I have but one wish, dearest, and that is for your happiness. May\r\nGod preserve you from any such fate as Lily\'s. When I tell you to\r\nwrite kindly to your cousin, I simply mean that I think him to have\r\ndeserved a kind reply by his honesty."\r\n\r\n"It shall be as kind as I can make it, mamma; but you know what the\r\nlady says in the play,--how hard it is to take the sting from that\r\nword \'no.\'" Then Bell walked out alone for a while, and on her return\r\ngot her desk and wrote her letter. It was very firm and decisive.\r\nAs for that wit which should pluck the sting "from such a sharp and\r\nwaspish word as \'no,\'" I fear she had it not. "It will be better\r\nto make him understand that I, also, am in earnest," she said to\r\nherself; and in this frame of mind she wrote her letter. "Pray do\r\nnot allow yourself to think that what I have said is unfriendly,"\r\nshe added, in a postscript. "I know how good you are, and I know the\r\ngreat value of what I refuse; but in this matter it must be my duty\r\nto tell you the simple truth."\r\n\r\nIt had been decided between the squire and Mrs. Dale that the removal\r\nfrom the Small House to Guestwick was not to take place till the\r\nfirst of May. When he had been made to understand that Dr. Crofts had\r\nthought it injudicious that Lily should be taken out of their present\r\nhouse in March, he had used all the eloquence of which he was master\r\nto induce Mrs. Dale to consent to abandon her project. He had told\r\nher that he had always considered that house as belonging, of right,\r\nto some other of the family than himself; that it had always been so\r\ninhabited, and that no squire of Allington had for years past taken\r\nrent for it. "There is no favour conferred,--none at all," he had\r\nsaid; but speaking nevertheless in his usual sharp, ungenial tone.\r\n\r\n"There is a favour, a great favour, and great generosity," Mrs. Dale\r\nhad replied. "And I have never been too proud to accept it; but when\r\nI tell you that we think we shall be happier at Guestwick, you will\r\nnot refuse to let us go. Lily has had a great blow in that house,\r\nand Bell feels that she is running counter to your wishes on her\r\nbehalf,--wishes that are so very kind!"\r\n\r\n"No more need be said about that. All that may come right yet, if you\r\nwill remain where you are."\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Dale knew that "all that" could never come right, and\r\npersisted. Indeed, she would hardly have dared to tell her girls\r\nthat she had yielded to the squire\'s entreaties. It was just then, at\r\nthat very time, that the squire was, as it were, in treaty with the\r\nearl about Lily\'s fortune; and he did feel it hard that he should be\r\nopposed in such a way by his own relatives at the moment when he was\r\nbehaving towards them with so much generosity. But in his arguments\r\nabout the house he said nothing of Lily, or her future prospects.\r\n\r\nThey were to move on the first of May, and one week of April was\r\nalready past. The squire had said nothing further on the matter after\r\nthe interview with Mrs. Dale to which allusion has just been made. He\r\nwas vexed and sore at the separation, thinking that he was ill-used\r\nby the feeling which was displayed by this refusal. He had done his\r\nduty by them, as he thought; indeed more than his duty, and now they\r\ntold him that they were leaving him because they could no longer bear\r\nthe weight of an obligation conferred by his hands. But in truth he\r\ndid not understand them; nor did they understand him. He had been\r\nhard in his manner, and had occasionally domineered, not feeling that\r\nhis position, though it gave him all the privileges of a near and a\r\ndear friend, did not give him the authority of a father or a husband.\r\nIn that matter of Bernard\'s proposed marriage he had spoken as though\r\nBell should have considered his wishes before she refused her cousin.\r\nHe had taken upon himself to scold Mrs. Dale, and had thereby given\r\noffence to the girls, which they at the time had found it utterly\r\nimpossible to forgive.\r\n\r\nBut they were hardly better satisfied in the matter than was he; and\r\nnow that the time had come, though they could not bring themselves to\r\ngo back from their demand, almost felt that they were treating the\r\nsquire with cruelty. When their decision had been made,--while it\r\nhad been making,--he had been stern and hard to them. Since that he\r\nhad been softened by Lily\'s misfortune, and softened also by the\r\nanticipated loneliness which would come upon him when they should be\r\ngone from his side. It was hard upon him that they should so treat\r\nhim when he was doing his best for them all! And they also felt this,\r\nthough they did not know the extent to which he was anxious to go in\r\nserving them. When they had sat round the fire planning the scheme of\r\ntheir removal, their hearts had been hardened against him, and they\r\nhad resolved to assert their independence. But now, when the time\r\nfor action had come, they felt that their grievances against him had\r\nalready been in a great measure assuaged. This tinged all that they\r\ndid with a certain sadness; but still they continued their work.\r\n\r\nWho does not know how terrible are those preparations for\r\nhouse-moving;--how infinite in number are the articles which must be\r\npacked, how inexpressibly uncomfortable is the period of packing, and\r\nhow poor and tawdry is the aspect of one\'s belongings while they are\r\nthus in a state of dislocation? Now-a-days people who understand the\r\nworld, and have money commensurate with their understanding, have\r\nlearned the way of shunning all these disasters, and of leaving the\r\nwork to the hands of persons paid for doing it. The crockery is left\r\nin the cupboards, the books on the shelves, the wine in the bins, the\r\ncurtains on their poles, and the family that is understanding goes\r\nfor a fortnight to Brighton. At the end of that time the crockery is\r\ncomfortably settled in other cupboards, the books on other shelves,\r\nthe wine in other bins, the curtains are hung on other poles, and\r\nall is arranged. But Mrs. Dale and her daughters understood nothing\r\nof such a method of moving as this. The assistance of the village\r\ncarpenter in filling certain cases that he had made was all that\r\nthey knew how to obtain beyond that of their own two servants. Every\r\narticle had to pass through the hands of some one of the family;\r\nand as they felt almost overwhelmed by the extent of the work to be\r\ndone, they began it much sooner than was necessary, so that it became\r\nevident as they advanced in their work, that they would have to pass\r\na dreadfully dull, stupid, uncomfortable week at last, among their\r\nboxes and cases, in all the confusion of dismantled furniture.\r\n\r\nAt first an edict had gone forth that Lily was to do nothing. She was\r\nan invalid, and was to be petted and kept quiet. But this edict soon\r\nfell to the ground, and Lily worked harder than either her mother or\r\nher sister. In truth she was hardly an invalid any longer, and would\r\nnot submit to an invalid\'s treatment. She felt herself that for the\r\npresent constant occupation could alone save her from the misery of\r\nlooking back,--and she had conceived an idea that the harder that\r\noccupation was, the better it would be for her. While pulling down\r\nthe books, and folding the linen, and turning out from their old\r\nhiding-places the small long-forgotten properties of the household,\r\nshe would be as gay as ever she had been in old times. She would talk\r\nover her work, standing with flushed cheek and laughing eyes among\r\nthe dusty ruins around her, till for a moment her mother would think\r\nthat all was well within her. But then at other moments, when the\r\nreaction came, it would seem as though nothing were well. She could\r\nnot sit quietly over the fire, with quiet rational work in her\r\nhands, and chat in a rational quiet way. Not as yet could she do\r\nso. Nevertheless it was well with her,--within her own bosom. She\r\nhad declared to herself that she would conquer her misery,--as she\r\nhad also declared to herself during her illness that her misfortune\r\nshould not kill her,--and she was in the way to conquer it. She told\r\nherself that the world was not over for her because her sweet hopes\r\nhad been frustrated. The wound had been deep and very sore, but the\r\nflesh of the patient had been sound and healthy, and her blood pure.\r\nA physician having knowledge in such cases would have declared, after\r\nlong watching of her symptoms, that a cure was probable. Her mother\r\nwas the physician who watched her with the closest eyes; and she,\r\nthough she was sometimes driven to doubt, did hope, with stronger\r\nhope from day to day, that her child might live to remember the story\r\nof her love without abiding agony.\r\n\r\nThat nobody should talk to her about it,--that had been the one\r\nstipulation which she had seemed to make, not sending forth a request\r\nto that effect among her friends in so many words, but showing by\r\ncertain signs that such was her stipulation. A word to that effect\r\nshe had spoken to her uncle,--as may be remembered, which word had\r\nbeen regarded with the closest obedience. She had gone out into\r\nher little world very soon after the news of Crosbie\'s falsehood\r\nhad reached her,--first to church and then among the people of the\r\nvillage, resolving to carry herself as though no crushing weight had\r\nfallen upon her. The village people had understood it all, listening\r\nto her and answering her without the proffer of any outspoken parley.\r\n\r\n"Lord bless \'ee," said Mrs. Crump, the postmistress,--and Mrs. Crump\r\nwas supposed to have the sourest temper in Allington,--"whenever I\r\nlook at thee, Miss Lily, I thinks that surely thee is the\r\nbeautifulest young \'ooman in all these parts."\r\n\r\n"And you are the crossest old woman," said Lily, laughing, and giving\r\nher hand to the postmistress.\r\n\r\n"So I be," said Mrs. Crump. "So I be." Then Lily sat down in the\r\ncottage and asked after her ailments. With Mrs. Hearn it was the\r\nsame. Mrs. Hearn, after that first meeting which has been already\r\nmentioned, petted and caressed her, but spoke no further word of her\r\nmisfortune. When Lily called a second time upon Mrs. Boyce, which\r\nshe did boldly by herself, that lady did begin one other word of\r\ncommiseration. "My dearest Lily, we have all been made so unhappy--"\r\nSo far Mrs. Boyce got, sitting close to Lily and striving to look\r\ninto her face; but Lily, with a slightly heightened colour, turned\r\nsharp round upon one of the Boyce girls, tearing Mrs. Boyce\'s\r\ncommiseration into the smallest shreds. "Minnie," she said, speaking\r\nquite loud, almost with girlish ecstasy, "what do you think Tartar\r\ndid yesterday? I never laughed so much in my life." Then she told\r\na ludicrous story about a very ugly terrier which belonged to the\r\nsquire. After that even Mrs. Boyce made no further attempt. Mrs. Dale\r\nand Bell both understood that such was to be the rule--the rule even\r\nto them. Lily would speak to them occasionally on the matter,--to\r\none of them at a time, beginning with some almost single word of\r\nmelancholy resignation, and then would go on till she opened her very\r\nbosom before them; but no such conversation was ever begun by them.\r\nBut now, in these busy days of the packing, that topic seemed to have\r\nbeen banished altogether.\r\n\r\n"Mamma," she said, standing on the top rung of a house-ladder, from\r\nwhich position she was handing down glass out of a cupboard, "are you\r\nsure that these things are ours? I think some of them belong to the\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure about that bowl at any rate, because it was my mother\'s\r\nbefore I was married."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, what should I do if I were to break it? Whenever I handle\r\nanything very precious I always feel inclined to throw it down and\r\nsmash it. Oh! it was as nearly gone as possible, mamma; but that was\r\nyour fault."\r\n\r\n"If you don\'t take care you\'ll be nearly gone yourself. Do take hold\r\nof something."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Bell, here\'s the inkstand for which you\'ve been moaning for\r\nthree years."\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: "Bell, here\'s the inkstand."]\r\n\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t been moaning for three years; but who could have put it up\r\nthere?"\r\n\r\n"Catch it," said Lily; and she threw the bottle down on to a pile of\r\ncarpets.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a step was heard in the hall, and the squire entered\r\nthrough the open door of the room. "So you\'re all at work," said he.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we\'re at work," said Mrs. Dale, almost with a tone of shame.\r\n"If it is to be done it is as well that it should be got over."\r\n\r\n"It makes me wretched enough," said the squire. "But I didn\'t come\r\nto talk about that. I\'ve brought you a note from Lady Julia De Guest,\r\nand I\'ve had one from the earl. They want us all to go there and stay\r\nthe week after Easter."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale and the girls, when this very sudden proposition was made\r\nto them, all remained fixed in their places, and, for a moment, were\r\nspeechless. Go and stay a week at Guestwick Manor! The whole family!\r\nHitherto the intercourse between the Manor and the Small House had\r\nbeen confined to morning calls, very far between. Mrs. Dale had\r\nnever dined there, and had latterly even deputed the calling to her\r\ndaughters. Once Bell had dined there with her uncle, the squire, and\r\nonce Lily had gone over with her uncle Orlando. Even this had been\r\nlong ago, before they were quite brought out, and they had regarded\r\nthe occasion with the solemn awe of children. Now, at this time of\r\ntheir flitting into some small mean dwelling at Guestwick, they had\r\npreviously settled among themselves that that affair of calling at\r\nthe Manor might be allowed to drop. Mrs. Eames never called, and they\r\nwere descending to the level of Mrs. Eames. "Perhaps we shall get\r\ngame sent to us, and that will be better," Lily had said. And now, at\r\nthis very moment of their descent in life, they were all asked to go\r\nand stay a week at the Manor! Stay a week with Lady Julia! Had the\r\nQueen sent the Lord Chamberlain down to bid them all go to Windsor\r\nCastle it could hardly have startled them more at the first blow.\r\nBell had been seated on the folded carpet when her uncle had entered,\r\nand now had again sat herself in the same place. Lily was still\r\nstanding at the top of the ladder, and Mrs. Dale was at the foot\r\nwith one hand on Lily\'s dress. The squire had told his story very\r\nabruptly, but he was a man who, having a story to tell, knew nothing\r\nbetter than to tell it out abruptly, letting out everything at the\r\nfirst moment.\r\n\r\n"Wants us all!" said Mrs. Dale. "How many does the all mean?" Then\r\nshe opened Lady Julia\'s note and read it, not moving from her\r\nposition at the foot of the ladder.\r\n\r\n"Do let me see, mamma," said Lily; and then the note was handed up\r\nto her. Had Mrs. Dale well considered the matter she might probably\r\nhave kept the note to herself for a while, but the whole thing was so\r\nsudden that she had not considered the matter well.\r\n\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR MRS. DALE [the letter ran],\r\n\r\n   I send this inside a note from my brother to Mr. Dale. We\r\n   particularly want you and your two girls to come to us for\r\n   a week from the seventeenth of this month. Considering our\r\n   near connection we ought to have seen more of each other\r\n   than we have done for years past, and of course it has\r\n   been our fault. But it is never too late to amend one\'s\r\n   ways; and I hope you will receive my confession in the\r\n   true spirit of affection in which it is intended, and that\r\n   you will show your goodness by coming to us. I will do all\r\n   I can to make the house pleasant to your girls, for both\r\n   of whom I have much real regard.\r\n\r\n   I should tell you that John Eames will be here for the\r\n   same week. My brother is very fond of him, and thinks him\r\n   the best young man of the day. He is one of my heroes,\r\n   too, I must confess.\r\n\r\n   Very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n   JULIA DE GUEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nLily, standing on the ladder, read the letter very attentively.\r\nThe squire meanwhile stood below speaking a word or two to his\r\nsister-in-law and niece. No one could see Lily\'s face, as it was\r\nturned away towards the window, and it was still averted when she\r\nspoke. "It is out of the question that we should go, mamma;--that is,\r\nall of us."\r\n\r\n"Why out of the question?" said the squire.\r\n\r\n"A whole family!" said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"That is just what they want," said the squire.\r\n\r\n"I should like of all things to be left alone for a week," said Lily,\r\n"if mamma and Bell would go."\r\n\r\n"That wouldn\'t do at all," said the squire. "Lady Julia specially\r\nwants you to be one of the party."\r\n\r\nThe thing had been badly managed altogether. The reference in Lady\r\nJulia\'s note to John Eames had explained to Lily the whole scheme at\r\nonce, and had so opened her eyes that all the combined influence of\r\nthe Dale and De Guest families could not have dragged her over to the\r\nManor.\r\n\r\n"Why not do?" said Lily. "It would be out of the question a whole\r\nfamily going in that way, but it would be very nice for Bell."\r\n\r\n"No, it would not," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be ungenerous about it, my dear," said the squire, turning to\r\nBell; "Lady Julia means to be kind. But, my darling," and the squire\r\nturned again towards Lily, addressing her, as was his wont in these\r\ndays, with an affection that was almost vexatious to her; "but, my\r\ndarling, why should you not go? A change of scene like that will do\r\nyou all the good in the world, just when you are getting well. Mary,\r\ntell the girls that they ought to go."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale stood silent, again reading the note, and Lily came down\r\nfrom the ladder. When she reached the floor she went directly up to\r\nher uncle, and taking his hand turned him round with herself towards\r\none of the windows, so that they stood with their backs to the room.\r\n"Uncle," she said, "do not be angry with me. I can\'t go;" and then\r\nshe put up her face to kiss him.\r\n\r\nHe stooped and kissed her and still held her hand. He looked into her\r\nface and read it all. He knew well, now, why she could not go; or,\r\nrather, why she herself thought that she could not go. "Cannot you,\r\nmy darling?" he said.\r\n\r\n"No, uncle. It is very kind,--very kind; but I cannot go. I am not\r\nfit to go anywhere."\r\n\r\n"But you should get over that feeling. You should make a struggle."\r\n\r\n"I am struggling, and I shall succeed; but I cannot do it all at\r\nonce. At any rate I could not go there. You must give my love to Lady\r\nJulia, and not let her think me cross. Perhaps Bell will go."\r\n\r\nWhat would be the good of Bell\'s going--or the good of his putting\r\nhimself out of the way, by a visit which would of itself be so\r\ntiresome to him, if the one object of the visit could not be carried\r\nout? The earl and his sister had planned the invitation with the\r\nexpress intention of bringing Lily and Eames together. It seemed\r\nthat Lily was firm in her determination to resist this intention;\r\nand, if so, it would be better that the whole thing should fall to\r\nthe ground. He was very vexed, and yet he was not angry with her.\r\nEverybody lately had opposed him in everything. All his intended\r\nfamily arrangements had gone wrong. But yet he was seldom angry\r\nrespecting them. He was so accustomed to be thwarted that he hardly\r\nexpected success. In this matter of providing Lily with a second\r\nlover, he had not come forward of his own accord. He had been\r\nappealed to by his neighbour the earl, and had certainly answered the\r\nappeal with much generosity. He had been induced to make the attempt\r\nwith eagerness, and a true desire for its accomplishment; but in\r\nthis, as in all his own schemes, he was met at once by opposition and\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\n"I will leave you to talk it over among yourselves," he said. "But,\r\nMary, you had better see me before you send your answer. If you will\r\ncome up by-and-by, Ralph shall take the two notes over together in\r\nthe afternoon." So saying, he left the Small House, and went back to\r\nhis own solitary home.\r\n\r\n"Lily, dear," said Mrs. Dale, as soon as the front door had been\r\nclosed, "this is meant for kindness to you,--for most affectionate\r\nkindness."\r\n\r\n"I know it, mamma; and you must go to Lady Julia, and must tell her\r\nthat I know it. You must give her my love. And, indeed, I do love her\r\nnow. But--"\r\n\r\n"You won\'t go, Lily?" said Mrs. Dale, beseechingly.\r\n\r\n"No, mamma; certainly I will not go." Then she escaped out of the\r\nroom by herself, and for the next hour neither of them dared to go to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nMRS. DALE IS THANKFUL FOR A GOOD THING.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that day they dined early at the Small House, as they had been in\r\nthe habit of doing since the packing had commenced. And after dinner\r\nMrs. Dale went through the gardens, up to the other house, with a\r\nwritten note in her hand. In that note she had told Lady Julia, with\r\nmany protestations of gratitude, that Lily was unable to go out so\r\nsoon after her illness, and that she herself was obliged to stay with\r\nLily. She explained also, that the business of moving was in hand,\r\nand that, therefore, she could not herself accept the invitation. But\r\nher other daughter, she said, would be very happy to accompany her\r\nuncle to Guestwick Manor. Then, without closing her letter, she took\r\nit up to the squire in order that it might be decided whether it\r\nwould or would not suit his views. It might well be that he would not\r\ncare to go to Lord De Guest\'s with Bell alone.\r\n\r\n"Leave it with me," he said; "that is, if you do not object."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you the plain truth at once, Mary. I shall go over myself\r\nwith it, and see the earl. Then I will decline it or not, according\r\nto what passes between me and him. I wish Lily would have gone."\r\n\r\n"Ah! she could not."\r\n\r\n"I wish she could. I wish she could. I wish she could." As he\r\nrepeated the words over and over again, there was an eagerness in his\r\nvoice that filled Mrs. Dale\'s heart with tenderness towards him.\r\n\r\n"The truth is," said Mrs. Dale, "she could not go there to meet John\r\nEames."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know," said the squire: "I understand it. But that is just\r\nwhat we want her to do. Why should she not spend a week in the same\r\nhouse with an honest young man whom we all like."\r\n\r\n"There are reasons why she would not wish it."\r\n\r\n"Ah, exactly; the very reasons which should make us induce her to go\r\nthere if we can. Perhaps I had better tell you all. Lord De Guest has\r\ntaken him by the hand, and wishes him to marry. He has promised to\r\nsettle on him an income which will make him comfortable for life."\r\n\r\n"That is very generous; and I am delighted to hear it,--for John\'s\r\nsake."\r\n\r\n"And they have promoted him at his office."\r\n\r\n"Ah! then he will do well."\r\n\r\n"He will do very well. He is private secretary now to their head man.\r\nAnd, Mary, so that she, Lily, should not be empty-handed if this\r\nmarriage can be arranged, I have undertaken to settle a hundred a\r\nyear on her,--on her and her children, if she will accept him. Now\r\nyou know it all. I did not mean to tell you; but it is as well that\r\nyou should have the means of judging. That other man was a villain.\r\nThis man is honest. Would it not be well that she should learn to\r\nlike him? She always did like him, I thought, before that other\r\nfellow came down here among us."\r\n\r\n"She has always liked him--as a friend."\r\n\r\n"She will never get a better lover."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale sat silent, thinking over it all. Every word that the\r\nsquire said was true. It would be a healing of wounds most desirable\r\nand salutary; an arrangement advantageous to them all; a destiny for\r\nLily most devoutly to be desired,--if only it were possible. Mrs.\r\nDale firmly believed that if her daughter could be made to accept\r\nJohn Eames as her second lover in a year or two all would be well.\r\nCrosbie would then be forgotten or thought of without regret, and\r\nLily would become the mistress of a happy home. But there are\r\npositions which cannot be reached, though there be no physical or\r\nmaterial objection in the way. It is the view which the mind takes of\r\na thing which creates the sorrow that arises from it. If the heart\r\nwere always malleable and the feelings could be controlled, who would\r\npermit himself to be tormented by any of the reverses which affection\r\nmeets? Death would create no sorrow; ingratitude would lose its\r\nsting; and the betrayal of love would do no injury beyond that which\r\nit might entail upon worldly circumstances. But the heart is not\r\nmalleable; nor will the feelings admit of such control.\r\n\r\n"It is not possible for her," said Mrs. Dale. "I fear it is not\r\npossible. It is too soon."\r\n\r\n"Six months," pleaded the squire.\r\n\r\n"It will take years,--not months," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"And she will lose all her youth."\r\n\r\n"Yes; he has done all that by his treachery. But it is done, and we\r\ncannot now go back. She loves him yet as dearly as she ever loved\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nThen the squire muttered certain words below his\r\nbreath,--ejaculations against Crosbie, which were hardly voluntary;\r\nbut even as involuntary ejaculations were very improper. Mrs. Dale\r\nheard them, and was not offended either by their impropriety or their\r\nwarmth. "But you can understand," she said, "that she cannot bring\r\nherself to go there." The squire struck the table with his fist,\r\nand repeated his ejaculations. If he could only have known how very\r\ndisagreeable Lady Alexandrina was making herself, his spirit might,\r\nperhaps, have been less vehemently disturbed. If, also, he could have\r\nperceived and understood the light in which an alliance with the De\r\nCourcy family was now regarded by Crosbie, I think that he would have\r\nreceived some consolation from that consideration. Those who offend\r\nus are generally punished for the offence they give; but we so\r\nfrequently miss the satisfaction of knowing that we are avenged! It\r\nis arranged, apparently, that the injurer shall be punished, but that\r\nthe person injured shall not gratify his desire for vengeance.\r\n\r\n"And will you go to Guestwick yourself?" asked Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"I will take the note," said the squire, "and will let you know\r\nto-morrow. The earl has behaved so kindly that every possible\r\nconsideration is due to him. I had better tell him the whole truth,\r\nand go or stay, as he may wish. I don\'t see the good of going. What\r\nam I to do at Guestwick Manor? I did think that if we had all been\r\nthere it might have cured some difficulties."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale got up to leave him, but she could not go without saying\r\nsome word of gratitude for all that he had attempted to do for\r\nthem. She well knew what he meant by the curing of difficulties.\r\nHe had intended to signify that had they lived together for a week\r\nat Guestwick the idea of flitting from Allington might possibly\r\nhave been abandoned. It seemed now to Mrs. Dale as though her\r\nbrother-in-law were heaping coals of fire on her head in return\r\nfor that intention. She felt half-ashamed of what she was doing,\r\nalmost acknowledging to herself that she should have borne with his\r\nsternness in return for the benefits he had done to her daughters.\r\nHad she not feared their reproaches she would, even now, have given\r\nway.\r\n\r\n"I do not know what I ought to say to you for your kindness."\r\n\r\n"Say nothing,--either for my kindness or unkindness; but stay where\r\nyou are, and let us live like Christians together, striving to\r\nthink good and not evil." These were kind, loving words, showing in\r\nthemselves a spirit of love and forbearance; but they were spoken in\r\na harsh, unsympathizing voice, and the speaker, as he uttered them,\r\nlooked gloomily at the fire. In truth the squire, as he spoke, was\r\nhalf-ashamed of the warmth of what he said.\r\n\r\n"At any rate I will not think evil," Mrs. Dale answered, giving him\r\nher hand. After that she left him, and returned home. It was too late\r\nfor her to abandon her project of moving and remain at the Small\r\nHouse; but as she went across the garden she almost confessed to\r\nherself that she repented of what she was doing.\r\n\r\nIn these days of the cold early spring, the way from the lawn into\r\nthe house, through the drawing-room window, was not as yet open, and\r\nit was necessary to go round by the kitchen-garden on to the road,\r\nand thence in by the front door; or else to pass through the back\r\ndoor, and into the house by the kitchen. This latter mode of entrance\r\nMrs. Dale now adopted; and as she made her way into the hall Lily\r\ncame upon her, with very silent steps, out from the parlour, and\r\narrested her progress. There was a smile upon Lily\'s face as she\r\nlifted up her finger as if in caution, and no one looking at her\r\nwould have supposed that she was herself in trouble. "Mamma," she\r\nsaid, pointing to the drawing-room door, and speaking almost in a\r\nwhisper, "you must not go in there; come into the parlour."\r\n\r\n"Who\'s there? Where\'s Bell?" and Mrs. Dale went into the parlour as\r\nshe was bidden. "But who is there?" she repeated.\r\n\r\n"He\'s there!"\r\n\r\n"Who is he?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma, don\'t be a goose! Dr. Crofts is there, of course. He\'s\r\nbeen nearly an hour. I wonder how he is managing, for there is\r\nnothing on earth to sit upon but the old lump of a carpet. The room\r\nis strewed about with crockery, and Bell is such a figure! She has\r\ngot on your old checked apron, and when he came in she was rolling up\r\nthe fire-irons in brown paper. I don\'t suppose she was ever in such a\r\nmess before. There\'s one thing certain,--he can\'t kiss her hand."\r\n\r\n"It\'s you are the goose, Lily."\r\n\r\n"But he\'s in there certainly, unless he has gone out through the\r\nwindow, or up the chimney."\r\n\r\n"What made you leave them?"\r\n\r\n"He met me here, in the passage, and spoke to me ever so seriously.\r\n\'Come in,\' I said, \'and see Bell packing the pokers and tongs.\' \'I\r\nwill go in,\' he said, \'but don\'t come with me.\' He was ever so\r\nserious, and I\'m sure he had been thinking of it all the way along."\r\n\r\n"And why should he not be serious?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, of course he ought to be serious; but are you not glad,\r\nmamma? I am so glad. We shall live alone together, you and I; but she\r\nwill be so close to us! My belief is that he\'ll stay there for ever\r\nunless somebody does something. I have been so tired of waiting and\r\nlooking out for you. Perhaps he\'s helping her to pack the things.\r\nDon\'t you think we might go in; or would it be ill-natured?"\r\n\r\n"Lily, don\'t be in too great a hurry to say anything. You may be\r\nmistaken, you know; and there\'s many a slip between the cup and the\r\nlip."\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma, there is," said Lily, putting her hand inside her\r\nmother\'s arm, "that\'s true enough."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my darling, forgive me," said the mother, suddenly remembering\r\nthat the use of the old proverb at the present moment had been almost\r\ncruel.\r\n\r\n"Do not mind it," said Lily, "it does not hurt me, it does me good;\r\nthat is to say, when there is nobody by except yourself. But, with\r\nGod\'s help, there shall be no slip here, and she shall be happy. It\r\nis all the difference between one thing done in a hurry, and another\r\ndone with much thinking. But they\'ll remain there for ever if we\r\ndon\'t go in. Come, mamma, you open the door."\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Dale did open the door, giving some little premonitory\r\nnotice with the handle, so that the couple inside might be warned of\r\napproaching footsteps. Crofts had not escaped, either through the\r\nwindow or up the chimney, but was seated in the middle of the room\r\non an empty box, just opposite to Bell, who was seated upon the\r\nlump of carpeting. Bell still wore the checked apron as described\r\nby her sister. What might have been the state of her hands I will\r\nnot pretend to say; but I do not believe that her lover had found\r\nanything amiss with them. "How do you do, doctor?" said Mrs. Dale,\r\nstriving to use her accustomed voice, and to look as though there\r\nwere nothing of special importance in his visit. "I have just come\r\ndown from the Great House."\r\n\r\n"Mamma," said Bell, jumping up, "you must not call him doctor any\r\nmore."\r\n\r\n"Must I not? Has any one undoctored him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma, you understand," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"I understand," said Lily, going up to the doctor, and giving him her\r\ncheek to kiss, "he is to be my brother, and I mean to claim him as\r\nsuch from this moment. I expect him to do everything for us, and not\r\nto call a moment of his time his own."\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Dale," said the doctor, "Bell has consented that it shall be\r\nso, if you will consent."\r\n\r\n"There is but little doubt of that," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"We shall not be rich--" began the doctor.\r\n\r\n"I hate to be rich," said Bell. "I hate even to talk about it. I\r\ndon\'t think it quite manly even to think about it; and I\'m sure it\r\nisn\'t womanly."\r\n\r\n"Bell was always a fanatic in praise of poverty," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"No; I\'m no fanatic. I\'m very fond of money earned. I would like to\r\nearn some myself if I knew how."\r\n\r\n"Let her go out and visit the lady patients," said Lily. "They do in\r\nAmerica."\r\n\r\nThen they all went into the parlour and sat round the fire talking as\r\nthough they were already one family. The proceeding, considering the\r\nnature of it,--that a young lady, acknowledged to be of great beauty\r\nand known to be of good birth, had on the occasion been asked and\r\ngiven in marriage,--was carried on after a somewhat humdrum fashion,\r\nand in a manner that must be called commonplace. How different had\r\nit been when Crosbie had made his offer! Lily for the time had been\r\nraised to a pinnacle,--a pinnacle which might be dangerous, but which\r\nwas, at any rate, lofty. With what a pretty speech had Crosbie been\r\ngreeted! How it had been felt by all concerned that the fortunes\r\nof the Small House were in the ascendant,--felt, indeed, with some\r\ntrepidation, but still with much inward triumph. How great had been\r\nthe occasion, forcing Lily almost to lose herself in wonderment\r\nat what had occurred! There was no great occasion now, and no\r\nwonderment. No one, unless it was Crofts, felt very triumphant. But\r\nthey were all very happy, and were sure that there was safety in\r\ntheir happiness. It was but the other day that one of them had been\r\nthrown rudely to the ground through the treachery of a lover, but yet\r\nnone of them feared treachery from this lover. Bell was as sure of\r\nher lot in life as though she were already being taken home to her\r\nmodest house in Guestwick. Mrs. Dale already looked upon the man as\r\nher son, and the party of four as they sat round the fire grouped\r\nthemselves as though they already formed one family.\r\n\r\nBut Bell was not seated next to her lover. Lily, when she had once\r\naccepted Crosbie, seemed to think that she could never be too near\r\nto him. She had been in no wise ashamed of her love, and had shown\r\nit constantly by some little caressing motion of her hand, leaning\r\non his arm, looking into his face, as though she were continually\r\ndesirous of some palpable assurance of his presence. It was not so at\r\nall with Bell. She was happy in loving and in being loved, but she\r\nrequired no overt testimonies of affection. I do not think it would\r\nhave made her unhappy if some sudden need had required that Crofts\r\nshould go to India and back before they were married. The thing was\r\nsettled, and that was enough for her. But, on the other hand, when\r\nhe spoke of the expediency of an immediate marriage, she raised no\r\ndifficulty. As her mother was about to go into a new residence, it\r\nmight be as well that that residence should be fitted to the wants of\r\ntwo persons instead of three. So they talked about chairs and tables,\r\ncarpets and kitchens, in a most unromantic, homely, useful manner!\r\nA considerable portion of the furniture in the house they were now\r\nabout to leave belonged to the squire,--or to the house rather,\r\nas they were in the habit of saying. The older and more solid\r\nthings,--articles of household stuff that stand the wear of half a\r\ncentury,--had been in the Small House when they came to it. There\r\nwas, therefore, a question of buying new furniture for a house in\r\nGuestwick,--a question not devoid of importance to the possessor of\r\nso moderate an income as that owned by Mrs. Dale. In the first month\r\nor two they were to live in lodgings, and their goods were to be\r\nstored in some friendly warehouse. Under such circumstances would\r\nit not be well that Bell\'s marriage should be so arranged that the\r\nlodging question might not be in any degree complicated by her\r\nnecessities? This was the last suggestion made by Dr. Crofts, induced\r\nno doubt by the great encouragement he had received.\r\n\r\n"That would be hardly possible," said Mrs. Dale. "It only wants three\r\nweeks;--and with the house in such a condition!"\r\n\r\n"James is joking," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"I was not joking at all," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Why not send for Mr. Boyce, and carry her off at once on a pillion\r\nbehind you?" said Lily. "It\'s just the sort of thing for primitive\r\npeople to do, like you and Bell. All the same, Bell, I do wish you\r\ncould have been married from this house."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it will make much difference," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"Only if you would have waited till summer we would have had such\r\na nice party on the lawn. It sounds so ugly, being married from\r\nlodgings; doesn\'t it, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t sound at all ugly to me," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"I shall always call you Dame Commonplace when you\'re married," said\r\nLily.\r\n\r\nThen they had tea, and after tea Dr. Crofts got on his horse and rode\r\nback to Guestwick.\r\n\r\n"Now may I talk about him?" said Lily, as soon as the door was closed\r\nbehind his back.\r\n\r\n"No; you may not."\r\n\r\n"As if I hadn\'t known it all along! And wasn\'t it hard to bear that\r\nyou should have scolded me with such pertinacious austerity, and that\r\nI wasn\'t to say a word in answer!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t remember the austerity," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"Nor yet Lily\'s silence," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"But it\'s all settled now," said Lily, "and I\'m downright happy. I\r\nnever felt more satisfaction,--never, Bell!"\r\n\r\n"Nor did I," said her mother; "I may truly say that I thank God for\r\nthis good thing."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nJOHN EAMES DOES THINGS WHICH HE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE DONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Eames succeeded in making his bargain with Sir Raffle Buffle. He\r\naccepted the private secretaryship on the plainly expressed condition\r\nthat he was to have leave of absence for a fortnight towards the end\r\nof April. Having arranged this he took an affectionate leave of Mr.\r\nLove, who was really much affected at parting with him, discussed\r\nvaledictory pots of porter in the big room, over which many wishes\r\nwere expressed that he might be enabled to compass the length and\r\nbreadth of old Huffle\'s feet, uttered a last cutting joke at Mr.\r\nKissing as he met that gentleman hurrying through the passages with\r\nan enormous ledger in his hands, and then took his place in the\r\ncomfortable arm-chair which FitzHoward had been forced to relinquish.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell any of the fellows," said Fitz, "but I\'m going to cut\r\nthe concern altogether. My governor wouldn\'t let me stop here in any\r\nother place than that of private secretary."\r\n\r\n"Ah, your governor is a swell," said Eames.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about that," said FitzHoward. "Of course he has a good\r\ndeal of family interest. My cousin is to come in for St. Bungay at\r\nthe next election, and then I can do better than remain here."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a matter of course," said Eames. "If my cousin were Member\r\nfor St. Bungay, I\'d never stand anything east of Whitehall."\r\n\r\n"And I don\'t mean," said FitzHoward. "This room, you know, is all\r\nvery nice; but it is a bore coming into the City every day. And then\r\none doesn\'t like to be rung for like a servant. Not that I mean to\r\nput you out of conceit with it."\r\n\r\n"It will do very well for me," said Eames. "I never was very\r\nparticular." And so they parted, Eames assuming the beautiful\r\narm-chair and the peril of being asked to carry Sir Raffle\'s shoes,\r\nwhile FitzHoward took the vacant desk in the big room till such time\r\nas some member of his family should come into Parliament for the\r\nborough of St. Bungay.\r\n\r\nBut Eames, though he drank the porter, and quizzed FitzHoward, and\r\ngibed at Kissing, did not seat himself in his new arm-chair without\r\nsome serious thoughts. He was aware that his career in London had not\r\nhitherto been one on which he could look back with self-respect. He\r\nhad lived with friends whom he did not esteem; he had been idle, and\r\nsometimes worse than idle; and he had allowed himself to be hampered\r\nby the pretended love of a woman for whom he had never felt any true\r\naffection, and by whom he had been cozened out of various foolish\r\npromises which even yet were hanging over his head. As he sat with\r\nSir Raffle\'s notes before him, he thought almost with horror of\r\nthe men and women in Burton Crescent. It was now about three years\r\nsince he had first known Cradell, and he shuddered as he remembered\r\nhow very poor a creature was he whom he had chosen for his bosom\r\nfriend. He could not make for himself those excuses which we can\r\nmake for him. He could not tell himself that he had been driven by\r\ncircumstances to choose a friend, before he had learned to know what\r\nwere the requisites for which he should look. He had lived on terms\r\nof closest intimacy with this man for three years, and now his eyes\r\nwere opening themselves to the nature of his friend\'s character.\r\nCradell was in age three years his senior. "I won\'t drop him," he\r\nsaid to himself; "but he is a poor creature." He thought, too, of the\r\nLupexes, of Miss Spruce, and of Mrs. Roper, and tried to imagine what\r\nLily Dale would do if she found herself among such people. It would\r\nbe impossible that she should ever so find herself. He might as well\r\nask her to drink at the bar of a gin-shop as to sit down in Mrs.\r\nRoper\'s drawing-room. If destiny had in store for him such good\r\nfortune as that of calling Lily his own, it was necessary that he\r\nshould altogether alter his mode of life.\r\n\r\nIn truth his hobbledehoyhood was dropping off from him, as its old\r\nskin drops from a snake. Much of the feeling and something of the\r\nknowledge of manhood was coming on him, and he was beginning to\r\nrecognize to himself that the future manner of his life must be to\r\nhim a matter of very serious concern. No such thought had come near\r\nhim when he first established himself in London. It seems to me that\r\nin this respect the fathers and mothers of the present generation\r\nunderstand but little of the inward nature of the young men for whom\r\nthey are so anxious. They give them credit for so much that it is\r\nimpossible they should have, and then deny them credit for so much\r\nthat they possess! They expect from them when boys the discretion\r\nof men,--that discretion which comes from thinking; but will not\r\ngive them credit for any of that power of thought which alone\r\ncan ultimately produce good conduct. Young men are generally\r\nthoughtful,--more thoughtful than their seniors; but the fruit of\r\ntheir thought is not as yet there. And then so little is done for the\r\namusement of lads who are turned loose into London at nineteen or\r\ntwenty. Can it be that any mother really expects her son to sit alone\r\nevening after evening in a dingy room drinking bad tea, and reading\r\ngood books? And yet it seems that mothers do so expect,--the very\r\nmothers who talk about the thoughtlessness of youth! O ye mothers who\r\nfrom year to year see your sons launched forth upon the perils of\r\nthe world, and who are so careful with your good advice, with under\r\nflannel shirting, with books of devotion and tooth-powder, does it\r\nnever occur to you that provision should be made for amusement, for\r\ndancing, for parties, for the excitement and comfort of women\'s\r\nsociety? That excitement your sons will have, and if it be not\r\nprovided by you of one kind, will certainly be provided by themselves\r\nof another kind. If I were a mother sending lads out into the world,\r\nthe matter most in my mind would be this,--to what houses full of\r\nnicest girls could I get them admission, so that they might do their\r\nflirting in good company.\r\n\r\nPoor John Eames had been so placed that he had been driven to do his\r\nflirting in very bad company, and he was now fully aware that it had\r\nbeen so. It wanted but two days to his departure for Guestwick Manor,\r\nand as he sat breathing a while after the manufacture of a large\r\nbatch of Sir Raffle\'s notes, he made up his mind that he would give\r\nMrs. Roper notice before he started, that on his return to London he\r\nwould be seen no more in Burton Crescent. He would break his bonds\r\naltogether asunder, and if there should be any penalty for such\r\nbreaking he would pay it in what best manner he might be able. He\r\nacknowledged to himself that he had been behaving badly to Amelia,\r\nconfessing, indeed, more sin in that respect than he had in truth\r\ncommitted; but this, at any rate, was clear to him, that he must put\r\nhimself on a proper footing in that quarter before he could venture\r\nto speak to Lily Dale.\r\n\r\nAs he came to a definite conclusion on this subject the little\r\nhandbell which always stood on Sir Raffle\'s table was sounded, and\r\nEames was called into the presence of the great man. "Ah," said Sir\r\nRaffle, leaning back in his arm-chair, and stretching himself after\r\nthe great exertions which he had been making--"Ah, let me see! You\r\nare going out of town the day after to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sir Raffle, the day after to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Ah! it\'s a great annoyance,--a very great annoyance. But on such\r\noccasions I never think of myself. I never have done so, and don\'t\r\nsuppose I ever shall. So you\'re going down to my old friend De\r\nGuest?"\r\n\r\nEames was always angered when his new patron Sir Raffle talked of his\r\nold friendship with the earl, and never gave the Commissioner any\r\nencouragement. "I am going down to Guestwick," said he.\r\n\r\n"Ah! yes; to Guestwick Manor? I don\'t remember that I was ever there.\r\nI daresay I may have been, but one forgets those things."\r\n\r\n"I never heard Lord De Guest speak of it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, no. Why should his memory be better than mine? Tell him,\r\nwill you, how very glad I shall be to renew our old intimacy. I\r\nshould think nothing of running down to him for a day or two in the\r\ndull time of the year,--say in September or October. It\'s rather a\r\ncoincidence our both being interested about you,--isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be sure to tell him."\r\n\r\n"Mind you do. He\'s one of our most thoroughly independent noblemen,\r\nand I respect him very highly. Let me see; didn\'t I ring my bell?\r\nWhat was it I wanted? I think I rang my bell."\r\n\r\n"You did ring your bell."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; I know. I am going away, and I wanted my--would you tell\r\nRafferty to bring me--my boots?" Whereupon Johnny rang the bell--not\r\nthe little handbell, but the other bell. "And I shan\'t be here\r\nto-morrow," continued Sir Raffle. "I\'ll thank you to send my\r\nletters up to the square; and if they should send down from the\r\nTreasury;--but the Chancellor would write, and in that case you\'ll\r\nsend up his letter at once by a special messenger, of course."\r\n\r\n"Here\'s Rafferty," said Eames, determined that he would not even\r\nsully his lips with speaking of Sir Raffle\'s boots.\r\n\r\n"Oh, ah, yes; Rafferty, bring me my boots."\r\n\r\n"Anything else to say?" asked Eames.\r\n\r\n"No, nothing else. Of course you\'ll be careful to leave everything\r\nstraight behind you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I\'ll leave it all straight." Then Eames withdrew, so that\r\nhe might not be present at the interview between Sir Raffle and his\r\nboots. "He\'ll not do," said Sir Raffle to himself. "He\'ll never do.\r\nHe\'s not quick enough,--has no go in him. He\'s not man enough for the\r\nplace. I wonder why the earl has taken him by the hand in that way."\r\n\r\nSoon after the little episode of the boots Eames left his office, and\r\nwalked home alone to Burton Crescent. He felt that he had gained a\r\nvictory in Sir Raffle\'s room, but the victory there had been easy.\r\nNow he had another battle on his hands, in which, as he believed, the\r\nachievement of victory would be much more difficult. Amelia Roper was\r\na person much more to be feared than the Chief Commissioner. He had\r\none strong arrow in his quiver on which he would depend, if there\r\nshould come to him the necessity of giving his enemy a death-wound.\r\nDuring the last week she had been making powerful love to Cradell,\r\nso as to justify the punishment of desertion from a former lover. He\r\nwould not throw Cradell in her teeth if he could help it; but it was\r\nincumbent on him to gain a victory, and if the worst should come to\r\nthe worst, he must use such weapons as destiny and the chance of war\r\nhad given him.\r\n\r\nHe found Mrs. Roper in the dining-room as he entered, and immediately\r\nbegan his work. "Mrs. Roper," he said, "I\'m going out of town the day\r\nafter to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, Mr. Eames, we know that. You\'re going as a visitor to the\r\nnoble mansion of the Earl De Guest."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about the mansion being very noble, but I\'m going down\r\ninto the country for a fortnight. When I come back--"\r\n\r\n"When you come back, Mr. Eames, I hope you\'ll find your room a deal\r\nmore comfortable. I know it isn\'t quite what it should be for a\r\ngentleman like you, and I\'ve been thinking for some time past--"\r\n\r\n"But, Mrs. Roper, I don\'t mean to come back here any more. It\'s just\r\nthat that I want to say to you."\r\n\r\n"Not come back to the crescent!"\r\n\r\n"No, Mrs. Roper. A fellow must move sometimes, you know; and I\'m sure\r\nI\'ve been very constant to you for a long time."\r\n\r\n"But where are you going, Mr. Eames?"\r\n\r\n"Well; I haven\'t just made up my mind as yet. That is, it will depend\r\non what I may do,--on what friends of mine may say down in the\r\ncountry. You\'ll not think I\'m quarrelling with you, Mrs. Roper."\r\n\r\n"It\'s them Lupexes as have done it," said Mrs. Roper, in her deep\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, Mrs. Roper, nobody has done it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is; and I\'m not going to blame you, Mr. Eames. They\'ve made\r\nthe house unfit for any decent young gentleman like you. I\'ve been\r\nfeeling that all along; but it\'s hard upon a lone woman like me,\r\nisn\'t it, Mr. Eames?"\r\n\r\n"But, Mrs. Roper, the Lupexes have had nothing to do with my going."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, they have; I understand it all. But what could I do, Mr.\r\nEames? I\'ve been giving them warning every week for the last six\r\nmonths; but the more I give them warning, the more they won\'t go.\r\nUnless I were to send for a policeman, and have a row in the house--"\r\n\r\n"But I haven\'t complained of the Lupexes, Mrs. Roper."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t be quitting without any reason, Mr. Eames. You are not\r\ngoing to be married in earnest, are you, Mr. Eames?"\r\n\r\n"Not that I know of."\r\n\r\n"You may tell me; you may, indeed. I won\'t say a word,--not to\r\nanybody. It hasn\'t been my fault about Amelia. It hasn\'t really."\r\n\r\n"Who says there\'s been any fault?"\r\n\r\n"I can see, Mr. Eames. Of course it didn\'t do for me to interfere.\r\nAnd if you had liked her, I will say I believe she\'d have made as\r\ngood a wife as any young man ever took; and she can make a few pounds\r\ngo farther than most girls. You can understand a mother\'s feelings;\r\nand if there was to be anything, I couldn\'t spoil it; could I, now?"\r\n\r\n"But there isn\'t to be anything."\r\n\r\n"So I\'ve told her for months past. I\'m not going to say anything to\r\nblame you; but young men ought to be very particular; indeed they\r\nought." Johnny did not choose to hint to the disconsolate mother that\r\nit also behoved young women to be very particular, but he thought it.\r\n"I\'ve wished many a time, Mr. Eames, that she had never come here;\r\nindeed I have. But what\'s a mother to do? I couldn\'t put her outside\r\nthe door." Then Mrs. Roper raised her apron up to her eyes, and began\r\nto sob.\r\n\r\n"I\'m very sorry if I\'ve made any mischief," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"It hasn\'t been your fault," continued the poor woman, from whom, as\r\nher tears became uncontrollable, her true feelings forced themselves\r\nand the real outpouring of her feminine nature. "Nor it hasn\'t been\r\nmy fault. But I knew what it would come to when I saw how she was\r\ngoing on; and I told her so. I knew you wouldn\'t put up with the\r\nlikes of her."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, Mrs. Roper, I\'ve always had a great regard for her, and for\r\nyou too."\r\n\r\n"But you weren\'t going to marry her. I\'ve told her so all along,\r\nand I\'ve begged her not to do it,--almost on my knees I have; but\r\nshe wouldn\'t be said by me. She never would. She\'s always been\r\nthat wilful that I\'d sooner have her away from me than with me.\r\nThough she\'s a good young woman in the house,--she is, indeed, Mr.\r\nEames;--and there isn\'t a pair of hands in it that works so hard; but\r\nit was no use my talking."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think any harm has been done."\r\n\r\n"Yes, there has; great harm. It has made the place not respectable.\r\nIt\'s the Lupexes is the worst. There\'s Miss Spruce, who has been\r\nwith me for nine years,--ever since I\'ve had the house,--she\'s been\r\ntelling me this morning that she means to go into the country. It\'s\r\nall the same thing. I understand it. I can see it. The house isn\'t\r\nrespectable, as it should be; and your mamma, if she were to know\r\nall, would have a right to be angry with me. I did mean to be\r\nrespectable, Mr. Eames; I did indeed."\r\n\r\n"Miss Spruce will think better of it."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know what I\'ve had to go through. There\'s none of them\r\npays, not regular,--only she and you. She\'s been like the Bank of\r\nEngland, has Miss Spruce."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I\'ve not been very regular, Mrs. Roper."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, you have. I don\'t think of a pound or two more or less\r\nat the end of a quarter, if I\'m sure to have it some day. The\r\nbutcher,--he understands one\'s lodgers just as well as I do,--if the\r\nmoney\'s really coming, he\'ll wait; but he won\'t wait for such as\r\nthem Lupexes, whose money\'s nowhere. And there\'s Cradell; would you\r\nbelieve it, that fellow owes me eight and twenty pounds!"\r\n\r\n"Eight and twenty pounds!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Eames, eight and twenty pounds! He\'s a fool. It\'s them\r\nLupexes as have had his money. I know it. He don\'t talk of paying,\r\nand going away. I shall be just left with him and the Lupexes on my\r\nhands; and then the bailiffs may come and sell every stick about the\r\nplace. I won\'t say nay to them." Then she threw herself into the old\r\nhorsehair arm-chair, and gave way to her womanly sorrow.\r\n\r\n"I think I\'ll go upstairs, and get ready for dinner," said Eames.\r\n\r\n"And you must go away when you come back?" said Mrs. Roper.\r\n\r\n"Well, yes, I\'m afraid I must. I meant you to have a month\'s warning\r\nfrom to-day. Of course I shall pay for the month."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to take any advantage; indeed, I don\'t. But I do hope\r\nyou\'ll leave your things. You can have them whenever you like. If\r\nChumpend knows that you and Miss Spruce are both going, of course\r\nhe\'ll be down upon me for his money." Chumpend was the butcher. But\r\nEames made no answer to this piteous plea. Whether or no he could\r\nallow his old boots to remain in Burton Crescent for the next week\r\nor two, must depend on the manner in which he might be received by\r\nAmelia Roper this evening.\r\n\r\nWhen he came down to the drawing-room, there was no one there but\r\nMiss Spruce. "A fine day, Miss Spruce," said he.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Eames, it is a fine day for London; but don\'t you think the\r\ncountry air is very nice?"\r\n\r\n"Give me the town," said Johnny, wishing to say a good word for poor\r\nMrs. Roper, if it were possible.\r\n\r\n"You\'re a young man, Mr. Eames; but I\'m only an old woman. That makes\r\na difference," said Miss Spruce.\r\n\r\n"Not much," said Johnny, meaning to be civil. "You don\'t like to be\r\ndull any more than I do."\r\n\r\n"I like to be respectable, Mr. Eames. I always have been respectable,\r\nMr. Eames." This the old woman said almost in a whisper, looking\r\nanxiously to see that the door had not been opened to other listening\r\nears.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure Mrs. Roper is very respectable."\r\n\r\n"Yes; Mrs. Roper is respectable, Mr. Eames; but there are some here\r\nthat-- Hush-sh-sh!" And the old lady put her finger up to her lips.\r\nThe door opened and Mrs. Lupex swam into the room.\r\n\r\n"How d\'ye do, Miss Spruce? I declare you\'re always first. It\'s to get\r\na chance of having one of the young gentlemen to yourself, I believe.\r\nWhat\'s the news in the city to-day, Mr. Eames? In your position now\r\nof course you hear all the news."\r\n\r\n"Sir Raffle Buffle has got a new pair of shoes. I don\'t know that for\r\ncertain, but I guess it from the time it took him to put them on."\r\n\r\n"Ah! now you\'re quizzing. That\'s always the way with you gentlemen\r\nwhen you get a little up in the world. You don\'t think women are\r\nworth talking to then, unless just for a joke or so."\r\n\r\n"I\'d a great deal sooner talk to you, Mrs. Lupex, than I would to Sir\r\nRaffle Buffle."\r\n\r\n"It\'s all very well for you to say that. But we women know what\r\nsuch compliments as those mean;--don\'t we, Miss Spruce? A woman\r\nthat\'s been married five years as I have--or I may say six,--doesn\'t\r\nexpect much attention from young men. And though I was young when I\r\nmarried--young in years, that is,--I\'d seen too much and gone through\r\ntoo much to be young in heart." This she said almost in a whisper;\r\nbut Miss Spruce heard it, and was confirmed in her belief that Burton\r\nCrescent was no longer respectable.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you were then, Mrs. Lupex," said Eames; "but\r\nyou\'re young enough now for anything."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Eames, I\'d sell all that remains of my youth at a cheap\r\nrate,--at a very cheap rate, if I could only be sure of--"\r\n\r\n"Sure of what, Mrs. Lupex?"\r\n\r\n"The undivided affection of the one person that I loved. That is all\r\nthat is necessary to a woman\'s happiness."\r\n\r\n"And isn\'t Lupex--"\r\n\r\n"Lupex! But, hush, never mind. I should not have allowed myself to\r\nbe betrayed into an expression of feeling. Here\'s your friend Mr.\r\nCradell. Do you know I sometimes wonder what you find in that man to\r\nbe so fond of him." Miss Spruce saw it all, and heard it all, and\r\npositively resolved upon moving herself to those two small rooms at\r\nDulwich.\r\n\r\nHardly a word was exchanged between Amelia and Eames before dinner.\r\nAmelia still devoted herself to Cradell, and Johnny saw that that\r\narrow, if it should be needed, would be a strong weapon. Mrs. Roper\r\nthey found seated at her place at the dining-table, and Eames could\r\nperceive the traces of her tears. Poor woman! Few positions in life\r\ncould be harder to bear than hers! To be ever tugging at others for\r\nmoney that they could not pay; to be ever tugged at for money which\r\nshe could not pay; to desire respectability for its own sake, but to\r\nbe driven to confess that it was a luxury beyond her means; to put\r\nup with disreputable belongings for the sake of lucre, and then not\r\nto get the lucre, but be driven to feel that she was ruined by the\r\nattempt! How many Mrs. Ropers there are who from year to year sink\r\ndown and fall away, and no one knows whither they betake themselves!\r\nOne fancies that one sees them from time to time at the corners of\r\nthe streets in battered bonnets and thin gowns, with the tattered\r\nremnants of old shawls upon their shoulders, still looking as\r\nthough they had within them a faint remembrance of long-distant\r\nrespectability. With anxious eyes they peer about, as though\r\nsearching in the streets for other lodgers. Where do they get their\r\ndaily morsels of bread, and their poor cups of thin tea,--their\r\ncups of thin tea, with perhaps a pennyworth of gin added to it, if\r\nProvidence be good! Of this state of things Mrs. Roper had a lively\r\nappreciation, and now, poor woman, she feared that she was reaching\r\nit, by the aid of the Lupexes. On the present occasion she carved her\r\njoint of meat in silence, and sent out her slices to the good guests\r\nthat would leave her, and to the bad guests that would remain, with\r\napathetic impartiality. What was the use now of doing favour to one\r\nlodger or disfavour to another? Let them take their mutton,--they\r\nwho would pay for it and they who would not. She would not have the\r\ncarving of many more joints in that house if Chumpend acted up to all\r\nthe threats which he had uttered to her that morning.\r\n\r\nThe reader may, perhaps, remember the little back room behind the\r\ndining parlour. A description was given in some former pages of an\r\ninterview which was held between Amelia and her lover. It was in\r\nthat room that all the interviews of Mrs. Roper\'s establishment had\r\ntheir existence. A special room for interviews is necessary in all\r\nhouseholds of a mixed nature. If a man lives alone with his wife,\r\nhe can have his interviews where he pleases. Sons and daughters,\r\neven when they are grown up, hardly create the necessity of an\r\ninterview-chamber, though some such need may be felt if the daughters\r\nare marriageable and independent in their natures. But when the\r\nfamily becomes more complicated than this, if an extra young man be\r\nintroduced, or an aunt comes into residence, or grown up children\r\nby a former wife interfere with the domestic simplicity, then such\r\naccommodation becomes quite indispensable. No woman would think of\r\ntaking in lodgers without such a room; and this room there was at\r\nMrs. Roper\'s, very small and dingy, but still sufficient,--just\r\nbehind the dining parlour and opposite to the kitchen stairs. Hither,\r\nafter dinner, Amelia was summoned. She had just seated herself\r\nbetween Mrs. Lupex and Miss Spruce, ready to do battle with the\r\nformer because she would stay, and with the latter because she would\r\ngo, when she was called out by the servant girl.\r\n\r\n"Miss Mealyer, Miss Mealyer,--sh--sh--sh!" And Amelia, looking round,\r\nsaw a large red hand beckoning to her. "He\'s down there," said\r\nJemima, as soon as her young mistress had joined her, "and wants to\r\nsee you most partic\'lar."\r\n\r\n"Which of \'em?" asked Amelia, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n"Why, Mr. Heames, to be sure. Don\'t you go and have anythink to say\r\nto the other one, Miss Mealyer, pray don\'t; he ain\'t no good; he\r\nain\'t indeed."\r\n\r\nAmelia stood still for a moment on the landing, calculating whether\r\nit would be well for her to have the interview, or well to decline\r\nit. Her objects were two;--or, rather, her object was in its\r\nnature twofold. She was, naturally, anxious to drive John Eames to\r\ndesperation; and anxious also, by some slight added artifice, to make\r\nsure of Cradell if Eames\'s desperation did not have a very speedy\r\neffect. She agreed with Jemima\'s criticism in the main, but she did\r\nnot go quite so far as to think that Cradell was no good at all. Let\r\nit be Eames, if Eames were possible; but let the other string be kept\r\nfor use if Eames were not possible. Poor girl! in coming to this\r\nresolve she had not done so without agony. She had a heart, and with\r\nsuch power as it gave her, she loved John Eames. But the world had\r\nbeen hard to her; knocking her about hither and thither unmercifully;\r\nthreatening, as it now threatened, to take from her what few good\r\nthings she enjoyed. When a girl is so circumstanced she cannot afford\r\nto attend to her heart. She almost resolved not to see Eames on the\r\npresent occasion, thinking that he might be made the more desperate\r\nby such refusal, and remembering also that Cradell was in the house\r\nand would know of it.\r\n\r\n"He\'s there a-waiting, Miss Mealyer. Why don\'t yer come down?" and\r\nJemima plucked her young mistress by the arm.\r\n\r\n"I am coming," said Amelia. And with dignified steps she descended to\r\nthe interview.\r\n\r\n"Here she is, Mr. Heames," said the girl. And then Johnny found\r\nhimself alone with his lady-love.\r\n\r\n"You have sent for me, Mr. Eames," she said, giving her head a little\r\ntoss, and turning her face away from him. "I was engaged upstairs,\r\nbut I thought it uncivil not to come down to you as you sent for me\r\nso special."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Miss Roper, I did want to see you very particularly."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear!" she exclaimed, and he understood fully that the\r\nexclamation referred to his having omitted the customary use of her\r\nChristian name.\r\n\r\n"I saw your mother before dinner, and I told her that I am going away\r\nthe day after to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"We all know about that;--to the earl\'s, of course!" And then there\r\nwas another chuck of her head.\r\n\r\n"And I told her also that I had made up my mind not to come back to\r\nBurton Crescent."\r\n\r\n"What! leave the house altogether!"\r\n\r\n"Well; yes. A fellow must make a change sometimes, you know."\r\n\r\n"And where are you going, John?"\r\n\r\n"That I don\'t know as yet."\r\n\r\n"Tell me the truth, John; are you going to be married? Are\r\nyou--going--to marry--that young woman,--Mr. Crosbie\'s leavings?\r\nI demand to have an answer at once. Are you going to marry her?"\r\n\r\nHe had determined very resolutely that nothing she might say should\r\nmake him angry, but when she thus questioned him about "Crosbie\'s\r\nleavings" he found it very difficult to keep his temper. "I have not\r\ncome," said he, "to speak to you about any one but ourselves."\r\n\r\n"That put-off won\'t do with me, sir. You are not to treat any girl\r\nyou may please in that sort of way;--oh, John!" Then she looked at\r\nhim as though she did not know whether to fly at him and cover him\r\nwith kisses, or to fly at him and tear his hair.\r\n\r\n"I know I haven\'t behaved quite as I should have done," he began.\r\n\r\n"Oh, John!" and she shook her head. "You mean, then, to tell me that\r\nyou are going to marry her?"\r\n\r\n"I mean to say nothing of the kind. I only mean to say that I am\r\ngoing away from Burton Crescent."\r\n\r\n"John Eames, I wonder what you think will come to you! Will you\r\nanswer me this; have I had a promise from you,--a distinct promise,\r\nover and over again, or have I not?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about a distinct promise--"\r\n\r\n"Well, well! I did think that you was a gentleman that would not go\r\nback from your word. I did think that. I did think that you would\r\nnever put a young lady to the necessity of bringing forward her own\r\nletters to prove that she is not expecting more than she has a right!\r\nYou don\'t know! And that, after all that has been between us! John\r\nEames!" And again it seemed to him as though she were about to fly.\r\n\r\n"I tell you that I know I haven\'t behaved well. What more can I say?"\r\n\r\n"What more can you say? Oh, John! to ask me such a question! If you\r\nwere a man you would know very well what more to say. But all you\r\nprivate secretaries are given to deceit, as the sparks fly upwards.\r\nHowever, I despise you,--I do, indeed. I despise you."\r\n\r\n"If you despise me, we might as well shake hands and part at once.\r\nI daresay that will be best. One doesn\'t like to be despised, of\r\ncourse; but sometimes one can\'t help it." And then he put out his\r\nhand to her.\r\n\r\n"And is this to be the end of all?" she said, taking it.\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; I suppose so. You say I\'m despised."\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t take up a poor girl in that way for a sharp word,--not\r\nwhen she is suffering as I am made to suffer. If you only think of\r\nit,--think what I have been expecting!" And now Amelia began to cry,\r\nand to look as though she were going to fall into his arms.\r\n\r\n"It is better to tell the truth," he said; "isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"But it shouldn\'t be the truth."\r\n\r\n"But it is the truth. I couldn\'t do it. I should ruin myself and you\r\ntoo, and we should never be happy."\r\n\r\n"I should be happy,--very happy indeed." At this moment the poor\r\ngirl\'s tears were unaffected, and her words were not artful. For a\r\nminute or two her heart,--her actual heart,--was allowed to prevail.\r\n\r\n"It cannot be, Amelia. Will you not say good-by?"\r\n\r\n"Good-by," she said, leaning against him as she spoke.\r\n\r\n"I do so hope you will be happy," he said. And then, putting his arm\r\nround her waist, he kissed her; which he certainly ought not to have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nWhen the interview was over, he escaped out into the crescent, and\r\nas he walked down through the squares,--Woburn Square, and Russell\r\nSquare, and Bedford Square,--towards the heart of London, he felt\r\nhimself elated almost to a state of triumph. He had got himself well\r\nout of his difficulties, and now he would be ready for his love-tale\r\nto Lily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST VISIT TO THE GUESTWICK BRIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: (untitled)]\r\n\r\nWhen John Eames arrived at Guestwick Manor, he was first welcomed by\r\nLady Julia. "My dear Mr. Eames," she said, "I cannot tell you how\r\nglad we are to see you." After that she always called him John, and\r\ntreated him throughout his visit with wonderful kindness. No doubt\r\nthat affair of the bull had in some measure produced this feeling;\r\nno doubt, also, she was well disposed to the man who she hoped might\r\nbe accepted as a lover by Lily Dale. But I am inclined to think that\r\nthe fact of his having beaten Crosbie had been the most potential\r\ncause of this affection for our hero on the part of Lady Julia.\r\nLadies,--especially discreet old ladies, such as Lady Julia De\r\nGuest,--are bound to entertain pacific theories, and to condemn\r\nall manner of violence. Lady Julia would have blamed any one who\r\nmight have advised Eames to commit an assault upon Crosbie. But,\r\nnevertheless, deeds of prowess are still dear to the female heart,\r\nand a woman, be she ever so old and discreet, understands and\r\nappreciates the summary justice which may be done by means of a\r\nthrashing. Lady Julia, had she been called upon to talk of it, would\r\nundoubtedly have told Eames that he had committed a fault in striking\r\nMr. Crosbie; but the deed had been done, and Lady Julia became very\r\nfond of John Eames.\r\n\r\n"Vickers shall show you your room, if you like to go upstairs; but\r\nyou\'ll find my brother close about the house if you choose to go\r\nout; I saw him not half an hour since." But John seemed to be well\r\nsatisfied to sit in the arm-chair over the fire, and talk to his\r\nhostess; so neither of them moved.\r\n\r\n"And now that you\'re a private secretary, how do you like it?"\r\n\r\n"I like the work well enough; only I don\'t like the man, Lady Julia.\r\nBut I shouldn\'t say so, because he is such an intimate friend of your\r\nbrother\'s."\r\n\r\n"An intimate friend of Theodore\'s!--Sir Raffle Buffle!" Lady Julia\r\nstiffened her back and put on a serious face, not being exactly\r\npleased at being told that the Earl De Guest had any such intimate\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n"At any rate he tells me so about four times a day, Lady Julia. And\r\nhe particularly wants to come down here next September."\r\n\r\n"Did he tell you that, too?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed he did. You can\'t believe what a goose he is! Then his voice\r\nsounds like a cracked bell; it\'s the most disagreeable voice you ever\r\nheard in your life. And one has always to be on one\'s guard lest he\r\nshould make one do something that is--is--that isn\'t quite the thing\r\nfor a gentleman. You understand;--what the messenger ought to do."\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t be too much afraid of your own dignity."\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not. If Lord De Guest were to ask me to fetch him his shoes,\r\nI\'d run to Guestwick and back for them and think nothing of it,--just\r\nbecause I know he\'s my friend. He\'d have a right to send me. But I\'m\r\nnot going to do such things as that for Sir Raffle Buffle."\r\n\r\n"Fetch him his shoes!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what FitzHoward had to do, and he didn\'t like it."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t Mr. FitzHoward nephew to the Duchess of St. Bungay?"\r\n\r\n"Nephew, or cousin, or something."\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" said Lady Julia, "what a horrible man!" And in this way\r\nJohn Eames and her ladyship became very intimate.\r\n\r\nThere was no one at dinner at the Manor that day but the earl and his\r\nsister and their single guest. The earl when he came in was very warm\r\nin his welcome, slapping his young friend on the back, and poking\r\njokes at him with a good-humoured if not brilliant pleasantry.\r\n\r\n"Thrashed anybody lately, John?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody to speak of," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"Brought your nightcap down for your out-o\'-doors nap?"\r\n\r\n"No; but I\'ve got a grand stick for the bull," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"Ah! that\'s no joke now, I can tell you," said the earl. "We had to\r\nsell him, and it half broke my heart. We don\'t know what had come to\r\nhim, but he became quite unruly after that;--knocked Darvell down\r\nin the straw-yard! It was a very bad business,--a very bad business,\r\nindeed! Come, go and dress. Do you remember how you came down to\r\ndinner that day? I shall never forget how Crofts stared at you. Come,\r\nyou\'ve only got twenty minutes, and you London fellows always want an\r\nhour."\r\n\r\n"He\'s entitled to some consideration now he\'s a private secretary,"\r\nsaid Lady Julia.\r\n\r\n"Bless us all! yes; I forgot that. Come, Mr. Private Secretary, don\'t\r\nstand on the grandeur of your neck-tie to-day, as there\'s nobody here\r\nbut ourselves. You shall have an opportunity to-morrow."\r\n\r\nThen Johnny was handed over to the groom of the chambers, and exactly\r\nin twenty minutes he re-appeared in the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Lady Julia had left them after dinner, the earl began to\r\nexplain his plan for the coming campaign. "I\'ll tell you now what I\r\nhave arranged," said he. "The squire is to be here to-morrow with his\r\neldest niece,--your Miss Lily\'s sister, you know."\r\n\r\n"What, Bell?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, with Bell, if her name is Bell. She\'s a very pretty girl, too.\r\nI don\'t know whether she\'s not the prettiest of the two, after all."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a matter of opinion."\r\n\r\n"Just so, Johnny; and do you stick to your own. They\'re coming here\r\nfor three or four days. Lady Julia did ask Mrs. Dale and Lily. I\r\nwonder whether you\'ll let me call her Lily?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear! I wish I might have the power of letting you."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just the battle that you\'ve got to fight. But the mother\r\nand the younger sister wouldn\'t come. Lady Julia says it\'s all\r\nright;--that, as a matter of course, she wouldn\'t come when she heard\r\nyou were to be here. I don\'t quite understand it. In my days the\r\nyoung girls were ready enough to go where they knew they\'d meet their\r\nlovers, and I never thought any the worse of them for it."\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t because of that," said Eames.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what Lady Julia says, and I always find her to be right in\r\nthings of that sort. And she says you\'ll have a better chance in\r\ngoing over there than you would here, if she were in the same house\r\nwith you. If I was going to make love to a girl, of course I\'d sooner\r\nhave her close to me,--staying in the same house. I should think it\r\nthe best fun in the world. And we might have had a dance, and all\r\nthat kind of thing. But I couldn\'t make her come, you know."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; of course not."\r\n\r\n"And Lady Julia thinks that it\'s best as it is. You must go over, you\r\nknow, and get the mother on your side, if you can. I take it, the\r\ntruth is this;--you mustn\'t be angry with me, you know, for saying\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"You may be sure of that."\r\n\r\n"I suppose she was fond of that fellow, Crosbie. She can\'t be very\r\nfond of him now, I should think, after the way he has treated her;\r\nbut she\'ll find a difficulty in making her confession that she really\r\nlikes you better than she ever liked him. Of course that\'s what\r\nyou\'ll want her to say."\r\n\r\n"I want her to say that she\'ll be my wife,--some day."\r\n\r\n"And when she has agreed to the some day, then you\'ll begin to press\r\nher to agree to your day;--eh, sir? My belief is you\'ll bring her\r\nround. Poor girl! why should she break her heart when a decent fellow\r\nlike you will only be too glad to make her a happy woman?" And in\r\nthis way the earl talked to Eames till the latter almost believed\r\nthat the difficulties were vanishing from out of his path. "Could\r\nit be possible," he asked himself, as he went to bed, "that in a\r\nfortnight\'s time Lily Dale should have accepted him as her future\r\nhusband?" Then he remembered that day on which Crosbie, with the\r\ntwo girls, had called at his mother\'s house, when in the bitterness\r\nof his heart, he had sworn to himself that he would always regard\r\nCrosbie as his enemy. Since then the world had gone well with him;\r\nand he had no longer any very bitter feeling against Crosbie. That\r\nmatter had been arranged on the platform of the Paddington Station.\r\nHe felt that if Lily would now accept him he could almost shake hands\r\nwith Crosbie. The episode in his life and in Lily\'s would have been\r\npainful; but he would learn to look back upon that without regret, if\r\nLily could be taught to believe that a kind fate had at last given\r\nher to the better of her two lovers. "I\'m afraid she won\'t bring\r\nherself to forget him," he had said to the earl. "She\'ll only be too\r\nhappy to forget him," the earl had answered, "if you can induce her\r\nto begin the attempt. Of course it is very bitter at first;--all the\r\nworld knew about it; but, poor girl, she is not to be wretched for\r\never, because of that. Do you go about your work with some little\r\nconfidence, and I doubt not but what you\'ll have your way. You have\r\neverybody in your favour,--the squire, her mother, and all." While\r\nsuch words as these were in his ears how could he fail to hope and to\r\nbe confident? While he was sitting cozily over his bedroom fire he\r\nresolved that it should be as the earl had said. But when he got up\r\non the following morning, and stood shivering as he came out of his\r\nbath, he could not feel the same confidence. "Of course I shall go\r\nto her," he said to himself, "and make a plain story of it. But I\r\nknow what her answer will be. She will tell me that she cannot forget\r\nhim." Then his feelings towards Crosbie were not so friendly as they\r\nhad been on the previous evening.\r\n\r\nHe did not visit the Small House on that, his first day. It had been\r\nthought better that he should first meet the squire and Bell at\r\nGuestwick Manor, so he postponed his visit to Mrs. Dale till the next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n"Go when you like," said the earl. "There\'s the brown cob for you to\r\ndo what you like with him while you are here."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go and see my mother," said John; "but I won\'t take the cob\r\nto-day. If you\'ll let me have him to-morrow, I\'ll ride to Allington."\r\nSo he walked off to Guestwick by himself.\r\n\r\nHe knew well every yard of the ground over which he went, remembering\r\nevery gate and stile and greensward from the time of his early\r\nboyhood. And now as he went along through his old haunts, he could\r\nnot but look back and think of the thoughts which had filled his mind\r\nin his earlier wanderings. As I have said before, in some of these\r\npages, no walks taken by the man are so crowded with thought as those\r\ntaken by the boy. He had been early taught to understand that the\r\nworld to him would be very hard; that he had nothing to look to but\r\nhis own exertions, and that those exertions would not, unfortunately,\r\nbe backed by any great cleverness of his own. I do not know that\r\nanybody had told him that he was a fool; but he had come to\r\nunderstand, partly through his own modesty, and partly, no doubt,\r\nthrough the somewhat obtrusive diffidence of his mother, that he was\r\nless sharp than other lads. It is probably true that he had come to\r\nhis sharpness later in life than is the case with many young men. He\r\nhad not grown on the sunny side of the wall. Before that situation\r\nin the Income-tax Office had fallen in his way, very humble modes of\r\nlife had offered themselves,--or, rather, had not offered themselves\r\nfor his acceptance. He had endeavoured to become an usher at a\r\ncommercial seminary, not supposed to be in a very thriving condition;\r\nbut he had been, luckily, found deficient in his arithmetic. There\r\nhad been some chance of his going into the leather-warehouse of\r\nMessrs. Basil and Pigskin, but those gentlemen had required a\r\npremium, and any payment of that kind had been quite out of his\r\nmother\'s power. A country attorney, who had known the family for\r\nyears, had been humbly solicited, the widow almost kneeling before\r\nhim with tears, to take Johnny by the hand and make a clerk of him;\r\nbut the attorney had discovered that Master Johnny Eames was not\r\nsupposed to be sharp, and would have none of him. During those days,\r\nthose gawky, gainless, un-admired days, in which he had wandered\r\nabout the lanes of Guestwick as his only amusement, and had composed\r\nhundreds of rhymes in honour of Lily Dale which no human eye but his\r\nown had ever seen, he had come to regard himself as almost a burden\r\nupon the earth. Nobody seemed to want him. His own mother was very\r\nanxious; but her anxiety seemed to him to indicate a continual desire\r\nto get rid of him. For hours upon hours he would fill his mind with\r\ncastles in the air, dreaming of wonderful successes in the midst of\r\nwhich Lily Dale always reigned as a queen. He would carry on the\r\nsame story in his imagination from month to month, almost contenting\r\nhimself with such ideal happiness. Had it not been for the possession\r\nof that power, what comfort could there have been to him in his life?\r\nThere are lads of seventeen who can find happiness in study, who can\r\nbusy themselves in books and be at their ease among the creations\r\nof other minds. These are they who afterwards become well-informed\r\nmen. It was not so with John Eames. He had never been studious. The\r\nperusal of a novel was to him in those days a slow affair; and of\r\npoetry he read but little, storing up accurately in his memory all\r\nthat he did read. But he created for himself his own romance, though\r\nto the eye a most unromantic youth; and he wandered through the\r\nGuestwick woods with many thoughts of which they who knew him best\r\nknew nothing. All this he thought of now as, with devious steps, he\r\nmade his way towards his old home;--with very devious steps, for he\r\nwent backwards through the woods by a narrow path which led right\r\naway from the town down to a little water-course, over which stood a\r\nwooden foot-bridge with a rail. He stood on the centre of the plank,\r\nat a spot which he knew well, and rubbing his hand upon the rail,\r\ncleansed it for the space of a few inches of the vegetable growth\r\nproduced by the spray of the water. There, rudely carved in the wood,\r\nwas still the word LILY. When he cut those letters she had been\r\nalmost a child. "I wonder whether she will come here with me and let\r\nme show it to her," he said to himself. Then he took out his knife\r\nand cleared the cuttings of the letters, and having done so, leaned\r\nupon the rail, and looked down upon the running water. How well\r\nthings in the world had gone for him! How well! And yet what would\r\nit all be if Lily would not come to him? How well the world had gone\r\nfor him! In those days when he stood there carving the girl\'s name\r\neverybody had seemed to regard him as a heavy burden, and he had so\r\nregarded himself. Now he was envied by many, respected by many, taken\r\nby the hand as a friend by those high in the world\'s esteem. When\r\nhe had come near the Guestwick Mansion in his old walks,--always,\r\nhowever, keeping at a great distance lest the grumpy old lord should\r\nbe down upon him and scold him,--he had little dreamed that he and\r\nthe grumpy old lord would ever be together on such familiar terms,\r\nthat he would tell to that lord more of his private thoughts than to\r\nany other living being; yet it had come to that. The grumpy old lord\r\nhad now told him that that gift of money was to be his whether Lily\r\nDale accepted him or no. "Indeed, the thing\'s done," said the grumpy\r\nlord, pulling out from his pocket certain papers, "and you\'ve got\r\nto receive the dividends as they become due." Then, when Johnny\r\nhad expostulated,--as, indeed, the circumstances had left him no\r\nalternative but to expostulate,--the earl had roughly bade him hold\r\nhis tongue, telling him that he would have to fetch Sir Raffle\'s\r\nboots directly he got back to London. So the conversation had quickly\r\nturned itself away to Sir Raffle, whom they had both ridiculed with\r\nmuch satisfaction. "If he finds his way down here in September,\r\nMaster Johnny, or in any other month either, you may fit my head\r\nwith a foolscap. Not remember, indeed! Is it not wonderful that any\r\nman should make himself so mean a fool?" All this was thought over\r\nagain, as Eames leaned upon the bridge. He remembered every word,\r\nand remembered many other words,--earlier words, spoken years ago,\r\nfilling him with desolation as to the prospects of his life. It had\r\nseemed that his friends had united in prophesying that the outlook\r\ninto the world for him was hopeless, and that the earning of bread\r\nmust be for ever beyond his power. And now his lines had fallen to\r\nhim in very pleasant places, and he was among those whom the world\r\nhad determined to caress. And yet, what would it all be if Lily would\r\nnot share his happiness? When he had carved that name on the rail,\r\nhis love for Lily had been an idea. It had now become a reality which\r\nmight probably be full of pain. If it were so,--if such should be\r\nthe result of his wooing,--would not those old dreamy days have been\r\nbetter than these--the days of his success?\r\n\r\nIt was one o\'clock by the time that he reached his mother\'s house,\r\nand he found her and his sister in a troubled and embarrassed state.\r\n"Of course you know, John," said his mother, as soon as their first\r\nembraces were over, "that we are going to dine at the Manor this\r\nevening?" But he did not know it, neither the earl nor Lady Julia\r\nhaving said anything on the subject. "Of course we are going," said\r\nMrs. Eames, "and it was so very kind. But I\'ve never been out to such\r\na house for so many years, John, and I do feel in such a twitter. I\r\ndined there once, soon after we were married; but I never have been\r\nthere since that."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not the earl I mind, but Lady Julia," said Mary Eames.\r\n\r\n"She\'s the most good-natured woman in the world," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear; people say she is so cross!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s because people don\'t know her. If I was asked who is the\r\nkindest-hearted woman I know in the world, I think I should say Lady\r\nJulia De Guest. I think I should."\r\n\r\n"Ah! but then they\'re so fond of you," said the admiring mother. "You\r\nsaved his lordship\'s life,--under Providence."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all bosh, mother. You ask Dr. Crofts. He knows them as well\r\nas I do."\r\n\r\n"Dr. Crofts is going to marry Bell Dale," said Mary; and then the\r\nconversation was turned from the subject of Lady Julia\'s perfections,\r\nand the awe inspired by the earl.\r\n\r\n"Crofts going to marry Bell!" exclaimed Eames, thinking almost with\r\ndismay of the doctor\'s luck in thus getting himself accepted all at\r\nonce, while he had been suing with the constancy almost of a Jacob.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mary; "and they say that she has refused her cousin\r\nBernard, and that, therefore, the squire is taking away the house\r\nfrom them. You know they\'re all coming into Guestwick."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know they are. But I don\'t believe that the squire is taking\r\naway the house."\r\n\r\n"Why should they come then? Why should they give up such a charming\r\nplace as that?"\r\n\r\n"Rent-free!" said Mrs. Eames.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know why they should come away, but I can\'t believe the\r\nsquire is turning them out; at any rate not for that reason." The\r\nsquire was prepared to advocate John\'s suit, and therefore John was\r\nbound to do battle on the squire\'s behalf.\r\n\r\n"He is a very stern man," said Mrs. Eames, "and they say that since\r\nthat affair of poor Lily\'s he has been more cross than ever with\r\nthem. As far as I know, it was not Lily\'s fault."\r\n\r\n"Poor Lily!" said Mary. "I do pity her. If I was her I should hardly\r\nknow how to show my face; I shouldn\'t, indeed."\r\n\r\n"And why shouldn\'t she show her face?" said John, in an angry tone.\r\n"What has she done to be ashamed of? Show her face indeed! I cannot\r\nunderstand the spite which one woman will sometimes have to another."\r\n\r\n"There is no spite, John; and it\'s very wrong of you to say so," said\r\nMary, defending herself. "But it is a very unpleasant thing for a\r\ngirl to be jilted. All the world knows that she was engaged to him."\r\n\r\n"And all the world knows--" But he would not proceed to declare that\r\nall the world knew also that Crosbie had been well thrashed for his\r\nbaseness. It would not become him to mention that even before his\r\nmother and sister. All the world did know it; all the world that\r\ncared to know anything of the matter;--except Lily Dale herself.\r\nNobody had ever yet told Lily Dale of that occurrence at the\r\nPaddington Railway Station, and it was well for John that her friends\r\nand his had been so discreet.\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course you are her champion," said Mary. "And I didn\'t\r\nmean to say anything unkind. Indeed I didn\'t. Of course it was a\r\nmisfortune."\r\n\r\n"I think it was the best piece of good fortune that could have\r\nhappened to her, not to marry a d---- scoundrel like--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, John!" exclaimed Mrs. Eames.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon, mother. But it isn\'t swearing to call such a\r\nman as that a d---- scoundrel." And he particularly emphasized the\r\nnaughty word, thinking that thereby he would add to its import, and\r\ntake away from its naughtiness. "But we won\'t talk any more about\r\nhim. I hate the man\'s very name. I hated him the first moment that I\r\nsaw him, and knew that he was a blackguard from his look. And I don\'t\r\nbelieve a word about the squire having been cross to them. Indeed I\r\nknow he has been the reverse of cross. So Bell is going to marry Dr.\r\nCrofts!"\r\n\r\n"There is no doubt on earth about that," said Mary. "And they say\r\nthat Bernard Dale is going abroad with his regiment."\r\n\r\nThen John discussed with his mother his duties as private secretary,\r\nand his intention of leaving Mrs. Roper\'s house. "I suppose it isn\'t\r\nnice enough for you now, John," said his mother.\r\n\r\n"It never was very nice, mother, to tell you the truth. There were\r\npeople there--. But you mustn\'t think I am turning up my nose because\r\nI\'m getting grand. I don\'t want to live any better than we all lived\r\nat Mrs. Roper\'s; but she took in persons that were not agreeable.\r\nThere is a Mr. and Mrs. Lupex there." Then he described something\r\nof their life in Burton Crescent, but did not say much about Amelia\r\nRoper. Amelia Roper had not made her appearance in Guestwick, as he\r\nhad once feared that she would do; and therefore it did not need that\r\nhe should at present make known to his mother that episode in his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWhen he got back to the Manor House he found that Mr. Dale and his\r\nniece had arrived. They were both sitting with Lady Julia when he\r\nwent into the morning room, and Lord De Guest was standing over the\r\nfire talking to them. Eames as he came among them felt terribly\r\nconscious of his position, as though all there were aware that he had\r\nbeen brought down from London on purpose to make a declaration of\r\nlove;--as, indeed, all of them were aware of that fact. Bell, though\r\nno one had told her so in direct words, was as sure of it as the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n"Here comes the prince of matadores," said the earl.\r\n\r\n"No, my lord; you\'re the prince. I\'m only your first follower."\r\nThough he could contrive that his words should be gay, his looks were\r\nsheepish, and when he gave his hand to the squire it was only by a\r\nstruggle that he could bring himself to look straight into the old\r\nman\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I\'m very glad to see you, John," said the squire, "very glad\r\nindeed."\r\n\r\n"And so am I," said Bell. "I have been so happy to hear that you have\r\nbeen promoted at your office, and so is mamma."\r\n\r\n"I hope Mrs. Dale is quite well," said he;--"and Lily." The word had\r\nbeen pronounced, but it had been done with so manifest an effort that\r\nall in the room were conscious of it, and paused as Bell prepared her\r\nlittle answer.\r\n\r\n"My sister has been very ill, you know,--with scarlatina. But she has\r\nrecovered with wonderful quickness, and is nearly well again now. She\r\nwill be so glad to see you if you will go over."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I shall certainly go over," said John.\r\n\r\n"And now shall I show you your room, Miss Dale?" said Lady Julia. And\r\nso the party was broken up, and the ice had been broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nLOQUITUR HOPKINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe squire had been told that his niece Bell had accepted Dr. Crofts,\r\nand he had signified a sort of acquiescence in the arrangement,\r\nsaying that if it were to be so, he had nothing to say against Dr.\r\nCrofts. He spoke this in a melancholy tone of voice, wearing on his\r\nface that look of subdued sorrow which was now almost habitual to\r\nhim. It was to Mrs. Dale that he spoke on the subject. "I could have\r\nwished that it might have been otherwise," he said, "as you are well\r\naware. I had family reasons for wishing that it might be otherwise.\r\nBut I have nothing to say against it. Dr. Crofts, as her husband,\r\nshall be welcome to my house." Mrs. Dale, who had expected much worse\r\nthan this, began to thank him for his kindness, and to say that she\r\nalso would have preferred to see her daughter married to her cousin.\r\n"But in such a matter the decision should be left entirely to the\r\ngirl. Don\'t you think so?"\r\n\r\n"I have not a word to say against her," he repeated. Then Mrs. Dale\r\nleft him, and told her daughter that her uncle\'s manner of receiving\r\nthe news had been, for him, very gracious. "You were his favourite,\r\nbut Lily will be so now," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care a bit about that;--or, rather, I do care, and think it\r\nwill be in every way better. But as I, who am the naughty one, will\r\ngo away, and as Lily, who is the good one, will remain with you,\r\ndoesn\'t it almost seem a pity that you should be leaving the house?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale thought it was almost a pity, but she could not say so now.\r\n"You think Lily will remain," she said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma; I feel sure she will."\r\n\r\n"She was always very fond of John Eames;--and he is doing so well."\r\n\r\n"It will be of no use, mamma. She is fond of him,--very fond. In a\r\nsort of a way she loves him--so well, that I feel sure she never\r\nmentions his name without some inward reference to her old childish\r\nthoughts and fancies. If he had come before Mr. Crosbie it would\r\nhave all been well with her. But she cannot do it now. Her pride\r\nwould prevent her, even if her heart permitted it. Oh! dear; it\'s\r\nvery wrong of me to say so, after all that I have said before; but\r\nI almost wish you were not going. Uncle Christopher seems to be\r\nless hard than he used to be; and as I was the sinner, and as I am\r\ndisposed of--"\r\n\r\n"It is too late now, my dear."\r\n\r\n"And we should neither of us have the courage to mention it to Lily,"\r\nsaid Bell.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the squire sent for his sister-in-law, as it\r\nwas his wont to do when necessity came for any discussion on matters\r\nof business. This was perfectly understood between them, and such\r\nsending was not taken as indicating any lack of courtesy on the part\r\nof Mr. Dale. "Mary," he said, as soon as Mrs. Dale was seated, "I\r\nshall do for Bell exactly what I have proposed to do for Lily. I had\r\nintended more than that once, of course. But then it would all have\r\ngone into Bernard\'s pocket; as it is, I shall make no difference\r\nbetween them. They shall each have a hundred a year,--that is, when\r\nthey marry. You had better tell Crofts to speak to me."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Dale, he doesn\'t expect it. He does not expect a penny."\r\n\r\n"So much the better for him; and, indeed, so much the better for her.\r\nHe won\'t make her the less welcome to his home because she brings\r\nsome assistance to it."\r\n\r\n"We have never thought of it,--any of us. The offer has come so\r\nsuddenly that I don\'t know what I ought to say."\r\n\r\n"Say--nothing. If you choose to make me a return for it--; but I am\r\nonly doing what I conceive to be my duty, and have no right to ask\r\nfor a kindness in return."\r\n\r\n"But what kindness can we show you, Mr. Dale?"\r\n\r\n"Remain in that house." In saying these last words he spoke as though\r\nhe were again angry,--as though he were again laying down the law to\r\nthem,--as though he were telling her of a duty which was due to him\r\nand incumbent on her. His voice was as stern and his face as acid as\r\never. He said that he was asking for a kindness; but surely no man\r\never asked for kindness in a voice so peremptory. "Remain in that\r\nhouse." Then he turned himself in towards his table as though he had\r\nno more to say.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Dale was beginning, now at last, to understand something of\r\nhis mind and real character. He could be affectionate and forbearing\r\nin his giving; but when asking, he could not be otherwise than stern.\r\nIndeed, he could not ask; he could only demand.\r\n\r\n"We have done so much now," Mrs. Dale began to plead.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, well. I did not mean to speak about that. Things are\r\nunpacked easier than they are packed. But, however-- Never mind. Bell\r\nis to go with me this afternoon to Guestwick Manor. Let her be up\r\nhere at two. Grimes can bring her box round, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes: of course."\r\n\r\n"And don\'t be talking to her about money before she starts. I had\r\nrather you didn\'t;--you understand. But when you see Crofts, tell him\r\nto come to me. Indeed, he\'d better come at once, if this thing is to\r\ngo on quickly."\r\n\r\nIt may easily be understood that Mrs. Dale would disobey the\r\ninjunctions contained in the squire\'s last words. It was quite out\r\nof the question that she should return to her daughters and not\r\ntell them the result of her morning\'s interview with their uncle.\r\nA hundred a year in the doctor\'s modest household would make all\r\nthe difference between plenty and want, between modest plenty and\r\nendurable want. Of course she told them, giving Bell to understand\r\nthat she must dissemble so far as to pretend ignorance of the affair.\r\n\r\n"I shall thank him at once," said Bell; "and tell him that I did not\r\nat all expect it, but am not too proud to accept it."\r\n\r\n"Pray don\'t, my dear; not just now. I am breaking a sort of promise\r\nin telling you at all,--only I could not keep it to myself. And he\r\nhas so many things to worry him! Though he says nothing about it now,\r\nhe has half broken his heart about you and Bernard." Then, too, Mrs.\r\nDale told the girls what request the squire had just made, and the\r\nmanner in which he had made it. "The tone of his voice as he spoke\r\nbrought tears into my eyes. I almost wish we had not done anything."\r\n\r\n"But, mamma," said Lily, "what difference can it make to him? You\r\nknow that our presence near him was always a trouble to him. He never\r\nreally wanted us. He liked to have Bell there when he thought that\r\nBell would marry his pet."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be unkind, Lily."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean to be unkind. Why shouldn\'t Bernard be his pet? I\r\nlove Bernard dearly, and always thought it the best point in uncle\r\nChristopher that he was so fond of him. I knew, you know, that it\r\nwas no use. Of course I knew it, as I understood all about--somebody\r\nelse. But Bernard is his pet."\r\n\r\n"He\'s fond of you all, in his own way," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"But is he fond of you?--that\'s the question," said Lily. "We could\r\nhave forgiven him anything done to us, and have put up with any words\r\nhe might have spoken to us, because he regards us as children. His\r\ngiving a hundred a year to Bell won\'t make you comfortable in this\r\nhouse if he still domineers over you. If a neighbour be neighbourly,\r\nnear neighbourhood is very nice. But uncle Christopher has not\r\nbeen neighbourly. He has wanted to be more than an uncle to us, on\r\ncondition that he might be less than a brother to you. Bell and I\r\nhave always felt that his regard on such terms was not worth having."\r\n\r\n"I almost feel that we have been wrong," said Mrs. Dale; "but in\r\ntruth I never thought that the matter would be to him one of so much\r\nmoment."\r\n\r\nWhen Bell had gone, Mrs. Dale and Lily were not disposed to continue\r\nwith much energy the occupation on which they had all been employed\r\nfor some days past. There had been life and excitement in the work\r\nwhen they had first commenced their packing, but now it was grown\r\nwearisome, dull, and distasteful. Indeed so much of it was done that\r\nbut little was left to employ them, except those final strappings and\r\nfastenings, and that last collection of odds and ends which could not\r\nbe accomplished till they were absolutely on the point of starting.\r\nThe squire had said that unpacking would be easier than packing, and\r\nMrs. Dale, as she wandered about among the hampers and cases, began\r\nto consider whether the task of restoring all the things to their\r\nold places would be very disagreeable. She said nothing of this to\r\nLily, and Lily herself, whatever might be her thoughts, made no such\r\nsuggestion to her mother.\r\n\r\n"I think Hopkins will miss us more than any one else," she said.\r\n"Hopkins will have no one to scold."\r\n\r\nJust at that moment Hopkins appeared at the parlour window, and\r\nsignified his desire for a conference.\r\n\r\n"You must come round," said Lily. "It\'s too cold for the window to\r\nbe opened. I always like to get him into the house, because he feels\r\nhimself a little abashed by the chairs and tables; or, perhaps, it is\r\nthe carpet that is too much for him. Out on the gravel-walks he is\r\nsuch a terrible tyrant, and in the greenhouse he almost tramples upon\r\none!"\r\n\r\nHopkins, when he did appear at the parlour door, seemed by his manner\r\nto justify Lily\'s discretion. He was not at all masterful in his\r\ntone or bearing, and seemed to pay to the chairs and tables all the\r\ndeference which they could have expected.\r\n\r\n"So you be going in earnest, ma\'am," he said, looking down at Mrs.\r\nDale\'s feet.\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Dale did not answer him at once, Lily spoke:--"Yes, Hopkins,\r\nwe are going in a very few days, now. We shall see you sometimes, I\r\nhope, over at Guestwick."\r\n\r\n"Humph!" said Hopkins. "So you be really going! I didn\'t think it\'d\r\never come to that, miss; I didn\'t indeed,--and no more it oughtn\'t;\r\nbut of course it isn\'t for me to speak."\r\n\r\n"People must change their residence sometimes, you know," said Mrs.\r\nDale, using the same argument by which Eames had endeavoured to\r\nexcuse his departure to Mrs. Roper.\r\n\r\n"Well, ma\'am; it ain\'t for me to say anything. But this I will say,\r\nI\'ve lived here about t\' squire\'s place, man and boy, jist all my\r\nlife, seeing I was born here, as you knows, Mrs. Dale; and of all\r\nthe bad things I ever see come about the place, this is a sight the\r\nworst."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Hopkins!"\r\n\r\n"The worst of all, ma\'am; the worst of all! It\'ll just kill t\'\r\nsquire! There\'s ne\'ery doubt in the world about that. It\'ll be the\r\nvery death of t\' old man."\r\n\r\n"That\'s nonsense, Hopkins," said Lily.\r\n\r\n"Very well, miss. I don\'t say but what it is nonsense; only you\'ll\r\nsee. There\'s Mr. Bernard,--he\'s gone away; and by all accounts he\r\nnever did care very much for the place. They all say he\'s a-going\r\nto the Hingies. And Miss Bell is going to be married,--which is all\r\nproper, in course; why shouldn\'t she? And why shouldn\'t you, too,\r\nMiss Lily?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I shall, some day, Hopkins."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no day like the present, Miss Lily. And I do say this, that\r\nthe man as pitched into him would be the man for my money." This,\r\nwhich Hopkins spoke in the excitement of the moment, was perfectly\r\nunintelligible to Lily, and Mrs. Dale, who shuddered as she heard\r\nhim, said not a word to call for any explanation. "But," continued\r\nHopkins, "that\'s all as it may be, Miss Lily, and you be in the hands\r\nof Providence,--as is others."\r\n\r\n"Exactly so, Hopkins."\r\n\r\n"But why should your mamma be all for going away? She ain\'t going\r\nto marry no one. Here\'s the house, and there\'s she, and there\'s t\'\r\nsquire; and why should she be for going away? So much going away all\r\nat once can\'t be for any good. It\'s just a breaking up of everything,\r\nas though nothing wasn\'t good enough for nobody. I never went away,\r\nand I can\'t abide it."\r\n\r\n"Well, Hopkins; it\'s settled now," said Mrs. Dale, "and I\'m afraid it\r\ncan\'t be unsettled."\r\n\r\n"Settled;--well. Tell me this: do you expect, Mrs. Dale, that he\'s to\r\nlive there all alone by hisself without any one to say a cross word\r\nto,--unless it be me or Dingles; for Jolliffe\'s worse than nobody,\r\nhe\'s so mortial cross hisself. Of course he can\'t stand it. If you\r\ngoes away, Mrs. Dale, Mister Bernard, he\'ll be squire in less than\r\ntwelve months. He\'ll come back from the Hingies, then, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think my brother-in-law will take it in that way, Hopkins."\r\n\r\n"Ah, ma\'am, you don\'t know him,--not as I knows him;--all the ins\r\nand outs and crinks and crannies of him. I knows him as I does the\r\nold apple-trees that I\'ve been a-handling for forty year. There\'s a\r\ndeal of bad wood about them old cankered trees, and some folk say\r\nthey ain\'t worth the ground they stand on; but I know where the\r\nsap runs, and when the fruit-blossom shows itself I know where the\r\nfruit will be the sweetest. It don\'t take much to kill one of them\r\nold trees,--but there\'s life in \'m yet if they be well handled."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I hope my brother\'s life may be long spared to him," said\r\nMrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t be taking yourself away, ma\'am, into them gashly lodgings\r\nat Guestwick. I says they are gashly for the likes of a Dale. It is\r\nnot for me to speak, ma\'am, of course. And I only came up now just to\r\nknow what things you\'d like with you out of the greenhouse."\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing, Hopkins, thank you," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"He told me to put up for you the best I could pick, and I means to\r\ndo it;" and Hopkins, as he spoke, indicated by a motion of his head\r\nthat he was making reference to the squire.\r\n\r\n"We shan\'t have any place for them," said Lily.\r\n\r\n"I must send a few, miss, just to cheer you up a bit. I fear you\'ll\r\nbe very dolesome there. And the doctor,--he ain\'t got what you can\r\ncall a regular garden, but there is a bit of a place behind."\r\n\r\n"But we wouldn\'t rob the dear old place," said Lily.\r\n\r\n"For the matter of that what does it signify? T\' squire\'ll be that\r\nwretched he\'ll turn sheep in here to destroy the place, or he\'ll have\r\nthe garden ploughed. You see if he don\'t. As for the place, the place\r\nis clean done for, if you leave it. You don\'t suppose he\'ll go and\r\nlet the Small House to strangers. T\' squire ain\'t one of that sort\r\nany ways."\r\n\r\n"Ah me!" exclaimed Mrs. Dale, as soon as Hopkins had taken himself\r\noff.\r\n\r\n"What is it, mamma? He\'s a dear old man, but surely what he says\r\ncannot make you really unhappy."\r\n\r\n"It is so hard to know what one ought to do. I did not mean to be\r\nselfish, but it seems to me as though I were doing the most selfish\r\nthing in the world."\r\n\r\n"Nay, mamma; it has been anything but selfish. Besides, it is we that\r\nhave done it; not you."\r\n\r\n"Do you know, Lily, that I also have that feeling as to breaking\r\nup one\'s old mode of life of which Hopkins spoke. I thought that I\r\nshould be glad to escape from this place, but now that the time has\r\ncome I dread it."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that you repent?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale did not answer her daughter at once, fearing to commit\r\nherself by words which could not be retracted. But at last she said,\r\n"Yes, Lily; I think I do repent. I think that it has not been well\r\ndone."\r\n\r\n"Then let it be undone," said Lily.\r\n\r\nThe dinner-party at Guestwick Manor on that day was not very bright,\r\nand yet the earl had done all in his power to make his guests happy.\r\nBut gaiety did not come naturally to his house, which, as will have\r\nbeen seen, was an abode very unlike in its nature to that of the\r\nother earl at Courcy Castle. Lady De Courcy at any rate understood\r\nhow to receive and entertain a house full of people, though the\r\npractice of doing so might give rise to difficult questions in the\r\nprivacy of her domestic relations. Lady Julia did not understand it;\r\nbut then Lady Julia was never called upon to answer for the expense\r\nof extra servants, nor was she asked about twice a week who\r\nthe ---- was to pay the wine-merchant\'s bill? As regards Lord De\r\nGuest and the Lady Julia themselves, I think they had the best of it;\r\nbut I am bound to admit, with reference to chance guests, that the\r\nhouse was dull. The people who were now gathered at the earl\'s table\r\ncould hardly have been expected to be very sprightly when in company\r\nwith each other. The squire was not a man much given to general\r\nsociety, and was unused to amuse a table full of people. On the\r\npresent occasion he sat next to Lady Julia, and from time to time\r\nmuttered a few words to her about the state of the country. Mrs.\r\nEames was terribly afraid of everybody there, and especially of the\r\nearl, next to whom she sat, and whom she continually called "my\r\nlord," showing by her voice as she did so that she was almost alarmed\r\nby the sound of her own voice. Mr. and Mrs. Boyce were there, the\r\nparson sitting on the other side of Lady Julia, and the parson\'s wife\r\non the other side of the earl. Mrs. Boyce was very studious to show\r\nthat she was quite at home, and talked perhaps more than any one\r\nelse; but in doing so she bored the earl most exquisitely, so that he\r\ntold John Eames the next morning that she was worse than the bull.\r\nThe parson ate his dinner, but said little or nothing between the two\r\ngraces. He was a heavy, sensible, slow man, who knew himself and his\r\nown powers. "Uncommon good stewed beef," he said, as he went home;\r\n"why can\'t we have our beef stewed like that?" "Because we don\'t pay\r\nour cook sixty pounds a year," said Mrs. Boyce. "A woman with sixteen\r\npounds can stew beef as well as a woman with sixty," said he; "she\r\nonly wants looking after." The earl himself was possessed of a sort\r\nof gaiety. There was about him a lightness of spirit which often made\r\nhim an agreeable companion to one single person. John Eames conceived\r\nhim to be the most sprightly old man of his day,--an old man with the\r\nfun and frolic almost of a boy. But this spirit, though it would show\r\nitself before John Eames, was not up to the entertainment of John\r\nEames\'s mother and sister, together with the squire, the parson, and\r\nthe parson\'s wife of Allington. So that the earl was overweighted and\r\ndid not shine on this occasion at his own dinner-table. Dr. Crofts,\r\nwho had also been invited, and who had secured the place which was\r\nnow peculiarly his own, next to Bell Dale, was no doubt happy enough;\r\nas, let us hope, was the young lady also; but they added very little\r\nto the general hilarity of the company. John Eames was seated between\r\nhis own sister and the parson, and did not at all enjoy his position.\r\nHe had a full view of the doctor\'s felicity, as the happy pair sat\r\nopposite to him, and conceived himself to be hardly treated by Lily\'s\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\nThe party was certainly very dull, as were all such dinners at\r\nGuestwick Manor. There are houses, which, in their every-day course,\r\nare not conducted by any means in a sad or unsatisfactory manner,--in\r\nwhich life, as a rule, runs along merrily enough; but which cannot\r\ngive a dinner-party; or, I might rather say, should never allow\r\nthemselves to be allured into the attempt. The owners of such houses\r\nare generally themselves quite aware of the fact, and dread the\r\ndinner which they resolved to give quite as much as it is dreaded\r\nby their friends. They know that they prepare for their guests an\r\nevening of misery, and for themselves certain long hours of purgatory\r\nwhich are hardly to be endured. But they will do it. Why that long\r\ntable, and all those supernumerary glasses and knives and forks,\r\nif they are never to be used? That argument produces all this\r\nmisery; that and others cognate to it. On the present occasion,\r\nno doubt, there were excuses to be made. The squire and his niece\r\nhad been invited on special cause, and their presence would have\r\nbeen well enough. The doctor added in would have done no harm. It\r\nwas good-natured, too, that invitation given to Mrs. Eames and her\r\ndaughter. The error lay in the parson and his wife. There was no\r\nnecessity for their being there, nor had they any ground on which to\r\nstand, except the party-giving ground. Mr. and Mrs. Boyce made the\r\ndinner-party, and destroyed the social circle. Lady Julia knew that\r\nshe had been wrong as soon as she had sent out the note.\r\n\r\nNothing was said on that evening which has any bearing on our story.\r\nNothing, indeed, was said which had any bearing on anything. The\r\nearl\'s professed object had been to bring the squire and young Eames\r\ntogether; but people are never brought together on such melancholy\r\noccasions. Though they sip their port in close contiguity, they are\r\npoles asunder in their minds and feelings. When the Guestwick fly\r\ncame for Mrs. Eames, and the parson\'s pony phaeton came for him and\r\nMrs. Boyce, a great relief was felt; but the misery of those who were\r\nleft had gone too far to allow of any reaction on that evening. The\r\nsquire yawned, and the earl yawned, and then there was an end of it\r\nfor that night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND VISIT TO THE GUESTWICK BRIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBell had declared that her sister would be very happy to see John\r\nEames if he would go over to Allington, and he had replied that of\r\ncourse he would go there. So much having been, as it were, settled,\r\nhe was able to speak of his visit as a matter of course at the\r\nbreakfast-table, on the morning after the earl\'s dinner-party.\r\n"I must get you to come round with me, Dale, and see what I am\r\ndoing to the land," the earl said. And then he proposed to order\r\nsaddle-horses. But the squire preferred walking, and in this way they\r\nwere disposed of soon after breakfast.\r\n\r\nJohn had it in his mind to get Bell to himself for half an hour,\r\nand hold a conference with her; but it either happened that Lady\r\nJulia was too keen in her duties as a hostess, or else, as was more\r\npossible, Bell avoided the meeting. No opportunity for such an\r\ninterview offered itself, though he hung about the drawing-room all\r\nthe morning. "You had better wait for luncheon, now," Lady Julia said\r\nto him about twelve. But this he declined; and taking himself away\r\nhid himself about the place for the next hour and a half. During this\r\ntime he considered much whether it would be better for him to ride or\r\nwalk. If she should give him any hope, he could ride back triumphant\r\nas a field-marshal. Then the horse would be delightful to him. But\r\nif she should give him no hope,--if it should be his destiny to be\r\nrejected utterly on that morning,--then the horse would be terribly\r\nin the way of his sorrow. Under such circumstances what could he do\r\nbut roam wide about across the fields, resting when he might choose\r\nto rest, and running when it might suit him to run. "And she is not\r\nlike other girls," he thought to himself. "She won\'t care for my\r\nboots being dirty." So at last he elected to walk.\r\n\r\n"Stand up to her boldly, man," the earl had said to him. "By George,\r\nwhat is there to be afraid of? It\'s my belief they\'ll give most to\r\nthose who ask for most. There\'s nothing sets \'em against a man like\r\nbeing sheepish." How the earl knew so much, seeing that he had not\r\nhimself given signs of any success in that walk of life, I am not\r\nprepared to say. But Eames took his advice as being in itself good,\r\nand resolved to act upon it. "Not that any resolution will be of any\r\nuse," he said to himself, as he walked along. "When the moment comes\r\nI know that I shall tremble before her, and I know that she\'ll see\r\nit; but I don\'t think it will make any difference in her."\r\n\r\nHe had last seen her on the lawn behind the Small House, just at that\r\ntime when her passion for Crosbie was at the strongest. Eames had\r\ngone thither impelled by a foolish desire to declare to her his\r\nhopeless love, and she had answered him by telling him that she loved\r\nMr. Crosbie better than all the world besides. Of course she had done\r\nso, at that time; but, nevertheless, her manner of telling him had\r\nseemed to him to be cruel. And he also had been cruel. He had told\r\nher that he hated Crosbie,--calling him "that man," and assuring her\r\nthat no earthly consideration should induce him to go into "that\r\nman\'s house." Then he had walked away moodily wishing him all manner\r\nof evil. Was it not singular that all the evil things which he, in\r\nhis mind, had meditated for the man, had fallen upon him. Crosbie\r\nhad lost his love! He had so proved himself to be a villain that his\r\nname might not be so much as mentioned! He had been ignominiously\r\nthrashed! But what good would all this be if his image were still\r\ndear to Lily\'s heart? "I told her that I loved her then," he said to\r\nhimself, "though I had no right to do so. At any rate I have a right\r\nto tell her now."\r\n\r\nWhen he reached Allington he did not go in through the village and up\r\nto the front of the Small House by the cross street, but turned by\r\nthe church gate and passed over the squire\'s terrace, and by the end\r\nof the Great House through the garden. Here he encountered Hopkins.\r\n"Why, if that b\'aint Mr. Eames!" said the gardener. "Mr. John, may I\r\nmake so bold!" and Hopkins held out a very dirty hand, which Eames of\r\ncourse took, unconscious of the cause of this new affection.\r\n\r\n"I\'m just going to call at the Small House, and I thought I\'d come\r\nthis way."\r\n\r\n"To be sure; this way, or that way, or any way, who\'s so welcome, Mr.\r\nJohn? I envies you; I envies you more than I envies any man. If I\r\ncould a got him by the scuff of the neck, I\'d a treated him jist like\r\nany wermin;--I would, indeed! He was wermin! I ollays said it. I\r\nhated him ollays; I did indeed, Mr. John, from the first moment when\r\nhe used to be nigging away at them foutry balls, knocking them in\r\namong the rhododendrons, as though there weren\'t no flower blossoms\r\nfor next year. He never looked at one as though one were a Christian;\r\ndid he, Mr. John?"\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t very fond of him myself, Hopkins."\r\n\r\n"Of course you weren\'t very fond of him. Who was?--only she, poor\r\nyoung lady. She\'ll be better now, Mr. John, a deal better. He wasn\'t\r\na wholesome lover,--not like you are. Tell me, Mr. John, did you give\r\nit him well when you got him? I heard you did;--two black eyes, and\r\nall his face one mash of gore!" And Hopkins, who was by no means a\r\nyoung man, stiffly put himself into a fighting attitude.\r\n\r\nEames passed on over the little bridge, which seemed to be in a state\r\nof fast decay, unattended to by any friendly carpenter, now that the\r\ndays of its use were so nearly at an end; and on into the garden,\r\nlingering on the spot where he had last said farewell to Lily. He\r\nlooked about as though he expected still to find her there; but there\r\nwas no one to be seen in the garden, and no sound to be heard. As\r\nevery step brought him nearer to her whom he was seeking, he became\r\nmore and more conscious of the hopelessness of his errand. Him she\r\nhad never loved, and why should he venture to hope that she would\r\nlove him now? He would have turned back had he not been aware that\r\nhis promise to others required that he should persevere. He had said\r\nthat he would do this thing, and he would be as good as his word. But\r\nhe hardly ventured to hope that he might be successful. In this frame\r\nof mind he slowly made his way up across the lawn.\r\n\r\n"My dear, there is John Eames," said Mrs. Dale, who had first seen\r\nhim from the parlour window.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go, mamma."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; perhaps it will be better that I should."\r\n\r\n"No, mamma, no; what good can it do? It can do no good. I like him as\r\nwell as I can like any one. I love him dearly. But it can do no good.\r\nLet him come in here, and be very kind to him; but do not go away and\r\nleave us. Of course I knew he would come, and I shall be very glad to\r\nsee him."\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Dale went round to the other room, and admitted her visitor\r\nthrough the window of the drawing-room. "We are in terrible\r\nconfusion, John, are we not?"\r\n\r\n"And so you are really going to live in Guestwick?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it looks like it, does it not? But, to tell you a\r\nsecret,--only it must be a secret; you must not mention it at\r\nGuestwick Manor; even Bell does not know;--we have half made up our\r\nminds to unpack all our things and stay where we are."\r\n\r\nEames was so intent on his own purpose, and so fully occupied with\r\nthe difficulty of the task before him, that he could hardly receive\r\nMrs. Dale\'s tidings with all the interest which they deserved.\r\n"Unpack them all again," he said. "That will be very troublesome. Is\r\nLily with you, Mrs. Dale?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, she is in the parlour. Come and see her." So he followed Mrs.\r\nDale through the hall, and found himself in the presence of his love.\r\n\r\n"How do you do, John?" "How do you do, Lily?" We all know the way\r\nin which such meetings are commenced. Each longed to be tender and\r\naffectionate to the other,--each in a different way; but neither knew\r\nhow to throw any tenderness into this first greeting. "So you\'re\r\nstaying at the Manor House," said Lily.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I\'m staying there. Your uncle and Bell came yesterday\r\nafternoon."\r\n\r\n"Have you heard about Bell?" said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; Mary told me. I\'m so glad of it. I always liked Dr. Crofts\r\nvery much. I have not congratulated her, because I didn\'t know\r\nwhether it was a secret. But Crofts was there last night, and if it\r\nis a secret he didn\'t seem to be very careful about keeping it."\r\n\r\n"It is no secret," said Mrs. Dale. "I don\'t know that I am fond\r\nof such secrets." But as she said this, she thought of Crosbie\'s\r\nengagement, which had been told to every one, and of its\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n"Is it to be soon?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; we think so. Of course nothing is settled."\r\n\r\n"It was such fun," said Lily. "James, who took, at any rate, a year\r\nor two to make his proposal, wanted to be married the next day\r\nafterwards."\r\n\r\n"No, Lily; not quite that."\r\n\r\n"Well, mamma, it was very nearly that. He thought it could all be\r\ndone this week. It has made us so happy, John! I don\'t know anybody I\r\nshould so much like for a brother. I\'m very glad you like him;--very\r\nglad. I hope you\'ll be friends always." There was some little\r\ntenderness in this,--as John acknowledged to himself.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure we shall,--if he likes it. That is, if I ever happen to see\r\nhim. I\'ll do anything for him I can if he ever comes up to London.\r\nWouldn\'t it be a good thing, Mrs. Dale, if he settled himself in\r\nLondon?"\r\n\r\n"No, John; it would be a very bad thing. Why should he wish to rob me\r\nof my daughter?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale was speaking of her eldest daughter; but the very allusion\r\nto any such robbery covered John Eames\'s face with a blush, made him\r\nhot up to the roots of his hair, and for the moment silenced him.\r\n\r\n"You think he would have a better career in London?" said Lily,\r\nspeaking under the influence of her superior presence of mind.\r\n\r\nShe had certainly shown defective judgment in desiring her mother not\r\nto leave them alone; and of this Mrs. Dale soon felt herself aware.\r\nThe thing had to be done, and no little precautionary measure, such\r\nas this of Mrs. Dale\'s enforced presence, would prevent it. Of this\r\nMrs. Dale was well aware; and she felt, moreover, that John was\r\nentitled to an opportunity of pleading his own cause. It might be\r\nthat such opportunity would avail him nothing, but not the less\r\nshould he have it of right, seeing that he desired it. But yet Mrs.\r\nDale did not dare to get up and leave the room. Lily had asked her\r\nnot to do so, and at the present period of their lives all Lily\'s\r\nrequests were sacred. They continued for some time to talk of Crofts\r\nand his marriage; and when that subject was finished, they discussed\r\ntheir own probable,--or, as it seemed now, improbable,--removal to\r\nGuestwick. "It\'s going too far, mamma," said Lily, "to say that you\r\nthink we shall not go. It was only last night that you suggested it.\r\nThe truth is, John, that Hopkins came in and discoursed with the\r\nmost wonderful eloquence. Nobody dared to oppose Hopkins. He made us\r\nalmost cry; he was so pathetic."\r\n\r\n"He has just been talking to me, too," said John, "as I came through\r\nthe squire\'s garden."\r\n\r\n"And what has he been saying to you?" said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know; not much." John, however, remembered well, at this\r\nmoment, all that the gardener had said to him. Did she know of that\r\nencounter between him and Crosbie? and if she did know of it, in what\r\nlight did she regard it?\r\n\r\nThey had sat thus for an hour together, and Eames was not as yet an\r\ninch nearer to his object. He had sworn to himself that he would not\r\nleave the Small House without asking Lily to be his wife. It seemed\r\nto him as though he would be guilty of falsehood towards the earl if\r\nhe did so. Lord De Guest had opened his house to him, and had asked\r\nall the Dales there, and had offered himself up as a sacrifice at the\r\ncruel shrine of a serious dinner-party, to say nothing of that easier\r\nand lighter sacrifice which he had made in a pecuniary point of view,\r\nin order that this thing might be done. Under such circumstances\r\nEames was too honest a man not to do it, let the difficulties in his\r\nway be what they might.\r\n\r\nHe had sat there for an hour, and Mrs. Dale still remained with her\r\ndaughter. Should he get up boldly and ask Lily to put on her bonnet\r\nand come out into the garden? As the thought struck him, he rose and\r\ngrasped at his hat. "I am going to walk back to Guestwick," said he.\r\n\r\n"It was very good of you to come so far to see us."\r\n\r\n"I was always fond of walking," he said. "The earl wanted me to ride,\r\nbut I prefer being on foot when I know the country, as I do here."\r\n\r\n"Have a glass of wine before you go."\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear, no. I think I\'ll go back through the squire\'s fields, and\r\nout on the road at the white gate. The path is quite dry now."\r\n\r\n"I dare say it is," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"Lily, I wonder whether you would come as far as that with me."\r\nAs the request was made Mrs. Dale looked at her daughter almost\r\nbeseechingly. "Do, pray do," said he; "it is a beautiful day for\r\nwalking."\r\n\r\nThe path proposed lay right across the field into which Lily had\r\ntaken Crosbie when she made her offer to let him off from his\r\nengagement. Could it be possible that she should ever walk there\r\nagain with another lover? "No, John," she said; "not to-day, I think.\r\nI am almost tired, and I had rather not go out."\r\n\r\n"It would do you good," said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to be done good to, mamma. Besides, I should have to\r\ncome back by myself."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come back with you," said Johnny.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; and then I should have to go again with you. But, John,\r\nreally I don\'t wish to walk to-day." Whereupon John Eames again put\r\ndown his hat.\r\n\r\n"Lily," said he; and then he stopped. Mrs. Dale walked away to the\r\nwindow, turning her back upon her daughter and visitor. "Lily, I have\r\ncome over here on purpose to speak to you. Indeed, I have come down\r\nfrom London only that I might see you."\r\n\r\n"Have you, John?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have. You know well all that I have got to tell you. I loved\r\nyou before he ever saw you; and now that he has gone, I love you\r\nbetter than I ever did. Dear Lily!" and he put out his hand to her.\r\n\r\n"No, John; no," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Must it be always no?"\r\n\r\n"Always no to that. How can it be otherwise? You would not have me\r\nmarry you while I love another!"\r\n\r\n"But he is gone. He has taken another wife."\r\n\r\n"I cannot change myself because he is changed. If you are kind to me\r\nyou will let that be enough."\r\n\r\n"But you are so unkind to me!"\r\n\r\n"No, no; oh, I would wish to be so kind to you! John, here; take my\r\nhand. It is the hand of a friend who loves you, and will always love\r\nyou. Dear John, I will do anything,--everything for you but that."\r\n\r\n"There is only one thing," said he, still holding her by the hand,\r\nbut with his face turned from her.\r\n\r\n"Nay; do not say so. Are you worse off than I am? I could not have\r\nthat one thing, and I was nearer to my heart\'s longings than you have\r\never been. I cannot have that one thing; but I know that there are\r\nother things, and I will not allow myself to be broken-hearted."\r\n\r\n"You are stronger than I am," he said.\r\n\r\n"Not stronger, but more certain. Make yourself as sure as I am, and\r\nyou, too, will be strong. Is it not so, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"I wish it could be otherwise;--I wish it could be otherwise! If you\r\ncan give him any hope--"\r\n\r\n"Mamma!"\r\n\r\n"Tell me that I may come again,--in a year," he pleaded.\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell you so. You may not come again,--not in this way. Do\r\nyou remember what I told you before, in the garden; that I loved him\r\nbetter than all the world besides? It is still the same. I still love\r\nhim better than all the world. How, then, can I give you any hope?"\r\n\r\n"But it will not be so for ever, Lily."\r\n\r\n"For ever! Why should he not be mine as well as hers when that for\r\never comes? John, if you understand what it is to love, you will say\r\nnothing more of it. I have spoken to you more openly about this than\r\nI have ever done to anybody, even to mamma, because I have wished to\r\nmake you understand my feelings. I should be disgraced in my own eyes\r\nif I admitted the love of another man, after--after--. It is to me\r\nalmost as though I had married him. I am not blaming him, remember.\r\nThese things are different with a man."\r\n\r\nShe had not dropped his hand, and as she made her last speech was\r\nsitting in her old chair with her eyes fixed upon the ground. She\r\nspoke in a low voice, slowly, almost with difficulty; but still the\r\nwords came very clearly, with a clear, distinct voice which caused\r\nthem to be remembered with accuracy, both by Eames and Mrs. Dale. To\r\nhim it seemed to be impossible that he should continue his suit after\r\nsuch a declaration. To Mrs. Dale they were terrible words, speaking\r\nof a perpetual widowhood, and telling of an amount of suffering\r\ngreater even than that which she had anticipated. It was true that\r\nLily had never said so much to her as she had now said to John\r\nEames, or had attempted to make so clear an exposition of her own\r\nfeelings. "I should be disgraced in my own eyes if I admitted the\r\nlove of another man!" They were terrible words, but very easy to be\r\nunderstood. Mrs. Dale had felt, from the first, that Eames was coming\r\ntoo soon, that the earl and the squire together were making an effort\r\nto cure the wound too quickly after its infliction; that time should\r\nhave been given to her girl to recover. But now the attempt had been\r\nmade, and words had been forced from Lily\'s lips, the speaking of\r\nwhich would never be forgotten by herself.\r\n\r\n"I knew that it would be so," said John.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; you know it, because your heart understands my heart. And\r\nyou will not be angry with me, and say naughty, cruel words, as you\r\ndid once before. We will think of each other, John, and pray for each\r\nother; and will always love one another. When we do meet let us be\r\nglad to see each other. No other friend shall ever be dearer to me\r\nthan you are. You are so true and honest! When you marry I will tell\r\nyour wife what an infinite blessing God has given her."\r\n\r\n"You shall never do that."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I will. I understand what you mean; but yet I will."\r\n\r\n"Good-by, Mrs. Dale," he said.\r\n\r\n"Good-by, John. If it could have been otherwise with her, you should\r\nhave had all my best wishes in the matter. I would have loved you\r\ndearly as my son; and I will love you now." Then she put up her lips\r\nand kissed his face.\r\n\r\n"And so will I love you," said Lily, giving him her hand again. He\r\nlooked longingly into her face as though he had thought it possible\r\nthat she also might kiss him: then he pressed her hand to his lips,\r\nand without speaking any further farewell, took up his hat and left\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n"Poor fellow!" said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"They should not have let him come," said Lily. "But they don\'t\r\nunderstand. They think that I have lost a toy, and they mean to be\r\ngood-natured, and to give me another." Very shortly after that Lily\r\nwent away by herself, and sat alone for hours; and when she joined\r\nher mother again at tea-time, nothing further was said of John\r\nEames\'s visit.\r\n\r\nHe made his way out by the front door, and through the churchyard,\r\nand in this way on to the field through which he had asked Lily to\r\nwalk with him. He hardly began to think of what had passed till he\r\nhad left the squire\'s house behind him. As he made his way through\r\nthe tombstones he paused and read one, as though it interested him.\r\nHe stood a moment under the tower looking up at the clock, and then\r\npulled out his own watch, as though to verify the one by the other.\r\nHe made, unconsciously, a struggle to drive away from his thoughts\r\nthe facts of the late scene, and for some five or ten minutes he\r\nsucceeded. He said to himself a word or two about Sir Raffle and his\r\nletters, and laughed inwardly as he remembered the figure of Rafferty\r\nbringing in the knight\'s shoes. He had gone some half mile upon his\r\nway before he ventured to stand still and tell himself that he had\r\nfailed in the great object of his life.\r\n\r\nYes; he had failed: and he acknowledged to himself, with bitter\r\nreproaches, that he had failed, now and for ever. He told himself\r\nthat he had obtruded upon her in her sorrow with an unmannerly love,\r\nand rebuked himself as having been not only foolish but ungenerous.\r\nHis friend the earl had been wont, in his waggish way, to call him\r\nthe conquering hero, and had so talked him out of his common sense\r\nas to have made him almost think that he would be successful in his\r\nsuit. Now, as he told himself that any such success must have been\r\nimpossible, he almost hated the earl for having brought him to this\r\ncondition. A conquering hero, indeed! How should he manage to sneak\r\nback among them all at the Manor House, crestfallen and abject in his\r\nmisery? Everybody knew the errand on which he had gone, and everybody\r\nmust know of his failure. How could he have been such a fool as to\r\nundertake such a task under the eyes of so many lookers-on? Was it\r\nnot the case that he had so fondly expected success, as to think only\r\nof his triumph in returning, and not of his more probable disgrace?\r\nHe had allowed others to make a fool of him, and had so made a fool\r\nof himself that now all hope and happiness were over for him. How\r\ncould he escape at once out of the country,--back to London? How\r\ncould he get away without saying a word further to any one? That was\r\nthe thought that at first occupied his mind.\r\n\r\nHe crossed the road at the end of the squire\'s property, where the\r\nparish of Allington divides itself from that of Abbot\'s Guest in\r\nwhich the earl\'s house stands, and made his way back along the copse\r\nwhich skirted the field in which they had encountered the bull, into\r\nthe high woods which were at the back of the park. Ah, yes; it had\r\nbeen well for him that he had not come out on horseback. That ride\r\nhome along the high road and up to the Manor House stables would,\r\nunder his present circumstances, have been almost impossible to him.\r\nAs it was, he did not think it possible that he should return to\r\nhis place in the earl\'s house. How could he pretend to maintain his\r\nordinary demeanour under the eyes of those two old men? It would be\r\nbetter for him to get home to his mother,--to send a message from\r\nthence to the Manor, and then to escape back to London. So thinking,\r\nbut with no resolution made, he went on through the woods, and down\r\nfrom the hill back towards the town till he again came to the little\r\nbridge over the brook. There he stopped and stood a while with\r\nhis broad hand spread over the letters which he had cut in those\r\nearly days, so as to hide them from his sight. "What an ass I have\r\nbeen,--always and ever!" he said to himself.\r\n\r\nIt was not only of his late disappointment that he was thinking, but\r\nof his whole past life. He was conscious of his hobbledehoyhood,--of\r\nthat backwardness on his part in assuming manhood which had rendered\r\nhim incapable of making himself acceptable to Lily before she had\r\nfallen into the clutches of Crosbie. As he thought of this he\r\ndeclared to himself that if he could meet Crosbie again he would\r\nagain thrash him,--that he would so belabour him as to send him out\r\nof the world, if such sending might possibly be done by fair beating,\r\nregardless whether he himself might be called upon to follow him.\r\nWas it not hard that for the two of them,--for Lily and for him\r\nalso,--there should be such punishment because of the insincerity of\r\nthat man? When he had thus stood upon the bridge for some quarter of\r\nan hour, he took out his knife, and, with deep, rough gashes in the\r\nwood, cut out Lily\'s name from the rail.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly finished, and was still looking at the chips as they\r\nwere being carried away by the stream, when a gentle step came close\r\nup to him, and turning round, he saw that Lady Julia was on the\r\nbridge. She was close to him, and had already seen his handiwork.\r\n"Has she offended you, John?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lady Julia!"\r\n\r\n"Has she offended you?"\r\n\r\n"She has refused me, and it is all over."\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: "She has refused me, and it is all over."]\r\n\r\n\r\n"It may be that she has refused you, and that yet it need not be all\r\nover. I am sorry that you have cut out the name, John. Do you mean to\r\ncut it out from your heart?"\r\n\r\n"Never. I would if I could, but I never shall."\r\n\r\n"Keep to it as to a great treasure. It will be a joy to you in after\r\nyears, and not a sorrow. To have loved truly, even though you shall\r\nhave loved in vain, will be a consolation when you are as old as I\r\nam. It is something to have had a heart."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I wish that I had none."\r\n\r\n"And, John;--I can understand her feeling now; and indeed, I thought\r\nall through that you were asking her too soon; but the time may yet\r\ncome when she will think better of your wishes."\r\n\r\n"No, no; never. I begin to know her now."\r\n\r\n"If you can be constant in your love you may win her yet. Remember\r\nhow young she is; and how young you both are. Come again in two\r\nyears\' time, and then, when you have won her, you shall tell me that\r\nI have been a good old woman to you both."\r\n\r\n"I shall never win her, Lady Julia." As he spoke these last words\r\nthe tears were running down his cheeks, and he was weeping openly in\r\npresence of his companion. It was well for him that she had come upon\r\nhim in his sorrow. When he once knew that she had seen his tears, he\r\ncould pour out to her the whole story of his grief; and as he did so\r\nshe led him back quietly to the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nNOT VERY FIE FIE AFTER ALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will perhaps be remembered that terrible things had been foretold\r\nas about to happen between the Hartletop and Omnium families. Lady\r\nDumbello had smiled whenever Mr. Plantagenet Palliser had spoken\r\nto her. Mr. Palliser had confessed to himself that politics were\r\nnot enough for him, and that Love was necessary to make up the full\r\ncomplement of his happiness. Lord Dumbello had frowned latterly when\r\nhis eyes fell on the tall figure of the duke\'s heir; and the duke\r\nhimself,--that potentate, generally so mighty in his silence,--the\r\nduke himself had spoken. Lady De Courcy and Lady Clandidlem were,\r\nboth of them, absolutely certain that the thing had been fully\r\narranged. I am, therefore, perfectly justified in stating that\r\nthe world was talking about the loves,--the illicit loves,--of Mr.\r\nPalliser and Lady Dumbello.\r\n\r\nAnd the talking of the world found its way down to that respectable\r\ncountry parsonage in which Lady Dumbello had been born, and from\r\nwhich she had been taken away to those noble halls which she now\r\ngraced by her presence. The talking of the world was heard at\r\nPlumstead Episcopi, where still lived Archdeacon Grantly, the lady\'s\r\nfather; and was heard also at the deanery of Barchester, where lived\r\nthe lady\'s aunt and grandfather. By whose ill-mannered tongue the\r\nrumour was spread in these ecclesiastical regions it boots not now to\r\ntell. But it may be remembered that Courcy Castle was not far from\r\nBarchester, and that Lady De Courcy was not given to hide her lights\r\nunder a bushel.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible rumour. To what mother must not such a rumour\r\nrespecting her daughter be very terrible? In no mother\'s ears\r\ncould it have sounded more frightfully than it did in those of Mrs.\r\nGrantly. Lady Dumbello, the daughter, might be altogether worldly;\r\nbut Mrs. Grantly had never been more than half worldly. In one moiety\r\nof her character, her habits, and her desires, she had been wedded\r\nto things good in themselves,--to religion, to charity, and to\r\nhonest-hearted uprightness. It is true that the circumstances of\r\nher life had induced her to serve both God and Mammon, and that,\r\ntherefore, she had gloried greatly in the marriage of her daughter\r\nwith the heir of a marquis. She had revelled in the aristocratic\r\nelevation of her child, though she continued to dispense books and\r\ncatechisms with her own hands to the children of the labourers of\r\nPlumstead Episcopi. When Griselda first became Lady Dumbello the\r\nmother feared somewhat lest her child should find herself unequal to\r\nthe exigencies of her new position. But the child had proved herself\r\nmore than equal to them, and had mounted up to a dizzy height of\r\nsuccess, which brought to the mother great glory and great fear also.\r\nShe delighted to think that her Griselda was great even among the\r\ndaughters of marquises; but she trembled as she reflected how deadly\r\nwould be the fall from such a height--should there ever be a fall!\r\n\r\nBut she had never dreamed of such a fall as this! She would have\r\nsaid,--indeed, she often had said,--to the archdeacon that Griselda\'s\r\nreligious principles were too firmly fixed to be moved by outward\r\nworldly matters; signifying, it may be, her conviction that that\r\nteaching of Plumstead Episcopi had so fastened her daughter into a\r\ngroove, that all the future teaching of Hartlebury would not suffice\r\nto undo the fastenings. When she had thus boasted no such idea as\r\nthat of her daughter running from her husband\'s house had ever come\r\nupon her; but she had alluded to vices of a nature kindred to that\r\nvice,--to vices into which other aristocratic ladies sometimes fell,\r\nwho had been less firmly grooved; and her boastings had amounted to\r\nthis,--that she herself had so successfully served God and Mammon\r\ntogether, that her child might go forth and enjoy all worldly things\r\nwithout risk of damage to things heavenly. Then came upon her this\r\nrumour. The archdeacon told her in a hoarse whisper that he had been\r\nrecommended to look to it, that it was current through the world that\r\nGriselda was about to leave her husband.\r\n\r\n"Nothing on earth shall make me believe it," said Mrs. Grantly. But\r\nshe sat alone in her drawing-room afterwards and trembled. Then came\r\nher sister, Mrs. Arabin, the dean\'s wife, over to the parsonage, and\r\nin half-hidden words told the same story. She had heard it from Mrs.\r\nProudie, the bishop\'s wife. "That woman is as false as the father of\r\nfalsehoods," said Mrs. Grantly. But she trembled the more; and as\r\nshe prepared her parish work, could think of nothing but her child.\r\nWhat would be all her life to come, what would have been all that\r\nwas past of her life, if this thing should happen to her? She would\r\nnot believe it; but yet she trembled the more as she thought of her\r\ndaughter\'s exaltation, and remembered that such things had been done\r\nin that world to which Griselda now belonged. Ah! would it not have\r\nbeen better for them if they had not raised their heads so high! And\r\nshe walked out alone among the tombs of the neighbouring churchyard,\r\nand stood over the grave in which had been laid the body of her other\r\ndaughter. Could be it that the fate of that one had been the happier.\r\n\r\nVery few words were spoken on the subject between her and the\r\narchdeacon, and yet it seemed agreed among them that something should\r\nbe done. He went up to London, and saw his daughter,--not daring,\r\nhowever, to mention such a subject. Lord Dumbello was cross with him,\r\nand very uncommunicative. Indeed both the archdeacon and Mrs. Grantly\r\nhad found that their daughter\'s house was not comfortable to them,\r\nand as they were sufficiently proud among their own class they had\r\nnot cared to press themselves on the hospitality of their son-in-law.\r\nBut he had been able to perceive that all was not right in the house\r\nin Carlton Gardens. Lord Dumbello was not gracious with his wife, and\r\nthere was something in the silence, rather than in the speech, of\r\nmen, which seemed to justify the report which had reached him.\r\n\r\n"He is there oftener than he should be," said the archdeacon. "And I\r\nam sure of this, at least, that Dumbello does not like it."\r\n\r\n"I will write to her," said Mrs. Grantly at last. "I am still her\r\nmother;--I will write to her. It may be that she does not know what\r\npeople say of her."\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Grantly did write.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Plumstead, April, 186--.\r\n\r\n   DEAREST GRISELDA,\r\n\r\n   It seems sometimes that you have been moved so far away\r\n   from me that I have hardly a right to concern myself more\r\n   in the affairs of your daily life, and I know that it\r\n   is impossible that you should refer to me for advice or\r\n   sympathy, as you would have done had you married some\r\n   gentleman of our own standing. But I am quite sure that\r\n   my child does not forget her mother, or fail to look back\r\n   upon her mother\'s love; and that she will allow me to\r\n   speak to her if she be in trouble, as I would to any other\r\n   child whom I had loved and cherished. I pray God that I\r\n   may be wrong in supposing that such trouble is near you.\r\n   If I am so you will forgive me my solicitude.\r\n\r\n   Rumours have reached us from more than one quarter\r\n   that--Oh! Griselda, I hardly know in what words to conceal\r\n   and yet to declare that which I have to write. They say\r\n   that you are intimate with Mr. Palliser, the nephew of\r\n   the duke, and that your husband is much offended. Perhaps\r\n   I had better tell you all, openly, cautioning you not\r\n   to suppose that I have believed it. They say that it\r\n   is thought that you are going to put yourself under Mr.\r\n   Palliser\'s protection. My dearest child, I think you can\r\n   imagine with what an agony I write these words,--with what\r\n   terrible grief I must have been oppressed before I could\r\n   have allowed myself to entertain the thoughts which have\r\n   produced them. Such things are said openly in Barchester,\r\n   and your father, who has been in town and has seen you,\r\n   feels himself unable to tell me that my mind may be at\r\n   rest.\r\n\r\n   I will not say to you a word as to the injury in a worldly\r\n   point of view which would come to you from any rupture\r\n   with your husband. I believe that you can see what would\r\n   be the effect of so terrible a step quite as plainly as I\r\n   can show it you. You would break the heart of your father,\r\n   and send your mother to her grave;--but it is not even\r\n   on that that I may most insist. It is this,--that you\r\n   would offend your God by the worst sin that a woman can\r\n   commit, and cast yourself into a depth of infamy in which\r\n   repentance before God is almost impossible, and from which\r\n   escape before man is not permitted.\r\n\r\n   I do not believe it, my dearest, dearest child,--my only\r\n   living daughter; I do not believe what they have said to\r\n   me. But as a mother I have not dared to leave the slander\r\n   unnoticed. If you will write to me and say that it is not\r\n   so, you will make me happy again, even though you should\r\n   rebuke me for my suspicion.\r\n\r\n   Believe that at all times, and under all circumstances,\r\n   I am still your loving mother, as I was in other days.\r\n\r\n   SUSAN GRANTLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now go back to Mr. Palliser as he sat in his chambers at the\r\nAlbany, thinking of his love. The duke had cautioned him, and the\r\nduke\'s agent had cautioned him; and he, in spite of his high feeling\r\nof independence, had almost been made to tremble. All his thousands\r\na year were in the balance, and perhaps everything on which depended\r\nhis position before the world. But, nevertheless, though he did\r\ntremble, he resolved to persevere. Statistics were becoming dry to\r\nhim, and love was very sweet. Statistics, he thought, might be made\r\nas enchanting as ever, if only they could be mingled with love. The\r\nmere idea of loving Lady Dumbello had seemed to give a salt to his\r\nlife of which he did not now know how to rob himself. It is true that\r\nhe had not as yet enjoyed many of the absolute blessings of love,\r\nseeing that his conversations with Lady Dumbello had never been\r\nwarmer than those which have been repeated in these pages; but his\r\nimagination had been at work; and now that Lady Dumbello was fully\r\nestablished at her house in Carlton Gardens, he was determined to\r\ndeclare his passion on the first convenient opportunity. It was\r\nsufficiently manifest to him that the world expected him to do so,\r\nand that the world was already a little disposed to find fault with\r\nthe slowness of his proceedings.\r\n\r\nHe had been once at Carlton Gardens since the season had commenced,\r\nand the lady had favoured him with her sweetest smile. But he had\r\nonly been half a minute alone with her, and during that half-minute\r\nhad only time to remark that he supposed she would now remain in\r\nLondon for the season.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," she had answered, "we shall not leave till July."\r\nNor could he leave till July, because of the exigencies of his\r\nstatistics. He therefore had before him two, if not three, clear\r\nmonths in which to manoeuvre, to declare his purposes, and prepare\r\nfor the future events of his life. As he resolved on a certain\r\nmorning that he would say his first tender word to Lady Dumbello that\r\nvery night, in the drawing-room of Lady De Courcy, where he knew that\r\nhe should meet her, a letter came to him by the post. He well knew\r\nthe hand and the intimation which it would contain. It was from the\r\nduke\'s agent, Mr. Fothergill, and informed him that a certain sum of\r\nmoney had been placed to his credit at his banker\'s. But the letter\r\nwent further, and informed him also that the duke had given his agent\r\nto understand that special instructions would be necessary before the\r\nnext quarterly payment could be made. Mr. Fothergill said nothing\r\nfurther, but Mr. Palliser understood it all. He felt his blood run\r\ncold round his heart; but, nevertheless, he determined that he would\r\nnot break his word to Lady De Courcy that night.\r\n\r\nAnd Lady Dumbello received her letter also on the same morning. She\r\nwas being dressed as she read it, and the maidens who attended her\r\nfound no cause to suspect that anything in the letter had excited her\r\nladyship. Her ladyship was not often excited, though she was vigilant\r\nin exacting from them their utmost cares. She read her letter,\r\nhowever, very carefully, and as she sat beneath the toilet implements\r\nof her maidens thought deeply of the tidings which had been brought\r\nto her. She was angry with no one;--she was thankful to no one. She\r\nfelt no special love for any person concerned in the matter. Her\r\nheart did not say, "Oh, my lord and husband!" or, "Oh, my lover!" or,\r\n"Oh, my mother, the friend of my childhood!" But she became aware\r\nthat matter for thought had been brought before her, and she did\r\nthink. "Send my love to Lord Dumbello," she said, when the operations\r\nwere nearly completed, "and tell him that I shall be so glad to see\r\nhim if he will come to me while I am at breakfast."\r\n\r\n"Yes, my lady." And then the message came back: "His lordship would\r\nbe with her ladyship certainly."\r\n\r\n"Gustavus," she said, as soon as she had seated herself discreetly in\r\nher chair, "I have had a letter from my mother, which you had better\r\nread;" and she handed to him the document. "I do not know what I\r\nhave done to deserve such suspicions from her; but she lives in the\r\ncountry, and has probably been deceived by ill-natured people. At any\r\nrate you must read it, and tell me what I should do."\r\n\r\nWe may predicate from this that Mr. Palliser\'s chance of being able\r\nto shipwreck himself upon that rock was but small, and that he would,\r\nin spite of himself, be saved from his uncle\'s anger. Lord Dumbello\r\ntook the letter and read it very slowly, standing, as he did so, with\r\nhis back to the fire. He read it very slowly, and his wife, though\r\nshe never turned her face directly upon his, could perceive that he\r\nbecame very red, that he was fluttered and put beyond himself, and\r\nthat his answer was not ready. She was well aware that his conduct\r\nto her during the last three months had been much altered from his\r\nformer usages; that he had been rougher with her in his speech when\r\nalone, and less courteous in his attention when in society; but she\r\nhad made no complaint or spoken a word to show him that she had\r\nmarked the change. She had known, moreover, the cause of his altered\r\nmanner, and having considered much, had resolved that she would live\r\nit down. She had declared to herself that she had done no deed and\r\nspoken no word that justified suspicion, and therefore she would make\r\nno change in her ways, or show herself to be conscious that she was\r\nsuspected. But now,--having her mother\'s letter in her hand,--she\r\ncould bring him to an explanation without making him aware that\r\nshe had ever thought that he had been jealous of her. To her, her\r\nmother\'s letter was a great assistance. It justified a scene like\r\nthis, and enabled her to fight her battle after her own fashion. As\r\nfor eloping with any Mr. Palliser, and giving up the position which\r\nshe had won;--no, indeed! She had been fastened in her grooves\r\ntoo well for that! Her mother, in entertaining any fear on such a\r\nsubject, had shown herself to be ignorant of the solidity of her\r\ndaughter\'s character.\r\n\r\n"Well, Gustavus," she said at last. "You must say what answer I shall\r\nmake, or whether I shall make any answer." But he was not even yet\r\nready to instruct her. So he unfolded the letter and read it again,\r\nand she poured out for herself a cup of tea.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a very serious matter," said he.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is serious; I could not but think such a letter from my\r\nmother to be serious. Had it come from any one else I doubt whether\r\nI should have troubled you; unless, indeed, it had been from any as\r\nnear to you as she is to me. As it is, you cannot but feel that I am\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"Right! Oh, yes, you are right,--quite right to tell me; you should\r\ntell me everything. D---- them!" But whom he meant to condemn he did\r\nnot explain.\r\n\r\n"I am above all things averse to cause you trouble," she said. "I\r\nhave seen some little things of late--"\r\n\r\n"Has he ever said anything to you?"\r\n\r\n"Who,--Mr. Palliser? Never a word."\r\n\r\n"He has hinted at nothing of this kind?"\r\n\r\n"Never a word. Had he done so, I must have made you understand that\r\nhe could not have been allowed again into my drawing-room." Then\r\nagain he read the letter, or pretended to do so.\r\n\r\n"Your mother means well," he said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, she means well. She has been foolish to believe the\r\ntittle-tattle that has reached her,--very foolish to oblige me to\r\ngive you this annoyance."\r\n\r\n"Oh, as for that, I\'m not annoyed. By Jove, no. Come, Griselda, let\r\nus have it all out; other people have said this, and I have been\r\nunhappy. Now, you know it all."\r\n\r\n"Have I made you unhappy?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no; not you. Don\'t be hard upon me when I tell you the whole\r\ntruth. Fools and brutes have whispered things that have vexed me.\r\nThey may whisper till the devil fetches them, but they shan\'t annoy\r\nme again. Give me a kiss, my girl." And he absolutely put out his\r\narms and embraced her. "Write a good-natured letter to your mother,\r\nand ask her to come up for a week in May. That\'ll be the best thing;\r\nand then she\'ll understand. By Jove, it\'s twelve o\'clock. Good-by."\r\n\r\nLady Dumbello was well aware that she had triumphed, and that her\r\nmother\'s letter had been invaluable to her. But it had been used, and\r\ntherefore she did not read it again. She ate her breakfast in quiet\r\ncomfort, looking over a milliner\'s French circular as she did so; and\r\nthen, when the time for such an operation had fully come, she got to\r\nher writing-table and answered her mother\'s letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n   DEAR MAMMA [she said],\r\n\r\n   I thought it best to show your letter at once to Lord\r\n   Dumbello. He said that people would be ill-natured, and\r\n   seemed to think that the telling of such stories could\r\n   not be helped. As regards you, he was not a bit angry,\r\n   but said that you and papa had better come to us for a\r\n   week about the end of next month. Do come. We are to\r\n   have rather a large dinner-party on the 23rd. His Royal\r\n   Highness is coming, and I think papa would like to meet\r\n   him. Have you observed that those very high bonnets have\r\n   all gone out: I never liked them; and as I had got a hint\r\n   from Paris, I have been doing my best to put them down. I\r\n   do hope nothing will prevent your coming.\r\n\r\n   Your affectionate daughter,\r\n\r\n   G. DUMBELLO.\r\n\r\n   Carlton Gardens, Wednesday.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Grantly was aware, from the moment in which she received the\r\nletter, that she had wronged her daughter by her suspicions. It did\r\nnot occur to her to disbelieve a word that was said in the letter,\r\nor an inference that was implied. She had been wrong, and rejoiced\r\nthat it was so. But nevertheless there was that in the letter which\r\nannoyed and irritated her, though she could not explain to herself\r\nthe cause of her annoyance. She had thrown all her heart into that\r\nwhich she had written, but in the words which her child had written\r\nnot a vestige of heart was to be found. In that reconciling of God\r\nand Mammon which Mrs. Grantly had carried on so successfully in the\r\neducation of her daughter, the organ had not been required, and had\r\nbecome withered, if not defunct, through want of use.\r\n\r\n"We will not go there, I think," said Mrs. Grantly, speaking to her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no; certainly not. If you want to go to town at all, I will\r\ntake rooms for you. And as for his Royal Highness--! I have a great\r\nrespect for his Royal Highness, but I do not in the least desire to\r\nmeet him at Dumbello\'s table."\r\n\r\nAnd so that matter was settled, as regarded the inhabitants of\r\nPlumstead Episcopi.\r\n\r\nAnd whither did Lord Dumbello betake himself when he left his wife\'s\r\nroom in so great a hurry at twelve o\'clock? Not to the Park, nor to\r\nTattersall\'s, nor to a Committee-room of the House of Commons, nor\r\nyet to the bow-window of his club. But he went straight to a great\r\njeweller\'s in Ludgate-hill, and there purchased a wonderful green\r\nnecklace, very rare and curious, heavy with green sparkling drops,\r\nwith three rows of shining green stones embedded in chaste gold,--a\r\nnecklace amounting almost to a jewelled cuirass in weight and\r\nextent. It had been in all the exhibitions, and was very costly and\r\nmagnificent. While Lady Dumbello was still dressing in the evening\r\nthis was brought to her with her lord\'s love, as his token of renewed\r\nconfidence; and Lady Dumbello, as she counted the sparkles, triumphed\r\ninwardly, telling herself that she had played her cards well.\r\n\r\nBut while she counted the sparkles produced by her full\r\nreconciliation with her lord, poor Plantagenet Palliser was still\r\ntrembling in his ignorance. If only he could have been allowed to see\r\nMrs. Grantly\'s letter, and the lady\'s answer, and the lord\'s present!\r\nBut no such seeing was vouchsafed to him, and he was carried off in\r\nhis brougham to Lady De Courcy\'s house, twittering with expectant\r\nlove, and trembling with expectant ruin. To this conclusion he had\r\ncome at any rate, that if anything was to be done, it should be\r\ndone now. He would speak a word of love, and prepare his future in\r\naccordance with the acceptance it might receive.\r\n\r\nLady De Courcy\'s rooms were very crowded when he arrived there. It\r\nwas the first great crushing party of the season, and all the world\r\nhad been collected into Portman Square. Lady De Courcy was smiling as\r\nthough her lord had no teeth, as though her eldest son\'s condition\r\nwas quite happy, and all things were going well with the De Courcy\r\ninterests. Lady Margaretta was there behind her, bland without\r\nand bitter within; and Lady Rosina also, at some further distance,\r\nreconciled to this world\'s vanity and finery because there was to\r\nbe no dancing. And the married daughters of the house were there\r\nalso, striving to maintain their positions on the strength of their\r\nundoubted birth, but subjected to some snubbing by the lowness\r\nof their absolute circumstances. Gazebee was there, happy in the\r\nabsolute fact of his connection with an earl, and blessed with the\r\nconsideration that was extended to him as an earl\'s son-in-law. And\r\nCrosbie, also, was in the rooms,--was present there, though he had\r\nsworn to himself that he would no longer dance attendance on the\r\ncountess, and that he would sever himself away from the wretchedness\r\nof the family. But if he gave up them and their ways, what else would\r\nthen be left to him? He had come, therefore, and now stood alone,\r\nsullen, in a corner, telling himself that all was vanity. Yes; to the\r\nvain all will be vanity; and to the poor of heart all will be poor.\r\n\r\nLady Dumbello was there in a small inner room, seated on a couch to\r\nwhich she had been brought on her first arrival at the house, and\r\non which she would remain till she departed. From time to time some\r\nvery noble or very elevated personage would come before her and say\r\na word, and she would answer that elevated personage with another\r\nword; but nobody had attempted with her the task of conversation. It\r\nwas understood that Lady Dumbello did not converse,--unless it were\r\noccasionally with Mr. Palliser.\r\n\r\nShe knew well that Mr. Palliser was to meet her there. He had told\r\nher expressly that he should do so, having inquired, with much\r\nsolicitude, whether she intended to obey the invitation of the\r\ncountess. "I shall probably be there," she had said, and now had\r\ndetermined that her mother\'s letter and her husband\'s conduct to her\r\nshould not cause her to break her word. Should Mr. Palliser "forget"\r\nhimself, she would know how to say a word to him as she had known how\r\nto say a word to her husband. Forget himself! She was very sure that\r\nMr. Palliser had been making up his mind to forget himself for some\r\nmonths past.\r\n\r\nHe did come to her, and stood over her, looking unutterable things.\r\nHis unutterable things, however, were so looked, that they did not\r\nabsolutely demand notice from the lady. He did not sigh like a\r\nfurnace, nor open his eyes upon her as though there were two suns in\r\nthe firmament above her head, nor did he beat his breast or tear his\r\nhair. Mr. Palliser had been brought up in a school which delights in\r\ntranquillity, and never allows its pupils to commit themselves either\r\nto the sublime or to the ridiculous. He did look an unutterable thing\r\nor two; but he did it with so decorous an eye, that the lady, who was\r\nmeasuring it all with great accuracy, could not, as yet, declare that\r\nMr. Palliser had "forgotten himself."\r\n\r\nThere was room by her on the couch, and once or twice, at Hartlebury,\r\nhe had ventured so to seat himself. On the present occasion, however,\r\nhe could not do so without placing himself manifestly on her dress.\r\nShe would have known how to fill a larger couch even than that,--as\r\nshe would have known, also, how to make room,--had it been her mind\r\nto do so. So he stood still over her, and she smiled at him. Such\r\na smile! It was cold as death, flattering no one, saying nothing,\r\nhideous in its unmeaning, unreal grace. Ah! how I hate the smile\r\nof a woman who smiles by rote! It made Mr. Palliser feel very\r\nuncomfortable;--but he did not analyze it, and persevered.\r\n\r\n"Lady Dumbello," he said, and his voice was very low, "I have been\r\nlooking forward to meeting you here."\r\n\r\n"Have you, Mr. Palliser? Yes; I remember that you asked me whether\r\nI was coming."\r\n\r\n"I did. Hm--Lady Dumbello!" and he almost trenched upon the outside\r\nverge of that schooling which had taught him to avoid both the\r\nsublime and the ridiculous. But he had not forgotten himself as yet,\r\nand so she smiled again.\r\n\r\n"Lady Dumbello, in this world in which we live, it is so hard to get\r\na moment in which we can speak." He had thought that she would move\r\nher dress, but she did not.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know," she said; "one doesn\'t often want to say very\r\nmuch, I think."\r\n\r\n"Ah, no; not often, perhaps. But when one does want! How I do\r\nhate these crowded rooms!" Yet, when he had been at Hartlebury he\r\nhad resolved that the only ground for him would be the crowded\r\ndrawing-room of some large London house. "I wonder whether you ever\r\ndesire anything beyond them?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said she; "but I confess that I am fond of parties."\r\n\r\nMr. Palliser looked round and thought that he saw that he was\r\nunobserved. He had made up his mind as to what he would do, and he\r\nwas determined to do it. He had in him none of that readiness which\r\nenables some men to make love and carry off their Dulcineas at a\r\nmoment\'s notice, but he had that pluck which would have made himself\r\ndisgraceful in his own eyes if he omitted to do that as to the doing\r\nof which he had made a solemn resolution. He would have preferred to\r\ndo it sitting, but, faute de mieux, seeing that a seat was denied to\r\nhim, he would do it standing.\r\n\r\n"Griselda," he said,--and it must be admitted that his tone was not\r\nbad. The word sank softly into her ear, like small rain upon moss,\r\nand it sank into no other ear. "Griselda!"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Palliser!" said she;--and though she made no scene, though\r\nshe merely glanced upon him once, he could see that he was wrong.\r\n\r\n"May I not call you so?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. Shall I ask you to see if my people are there?" He\r\nstood a moment before her hesitating. "My carriage, I mean." As she\r\ngave the command she glanced at him again, and then he obeyed her\r\norders.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned she had left her seat; but he heard her name\r\nannounced on the stairs, and caught a glance of the back of her head\r\nas she made her way gracefully down through the crowd. He never\r\nattempted to make love to her again, utterly disappointing the hopes\r\nof Lady De Courcy, Mrs. Proudie, and Lady Clandidlem.\r\n\r\nAs I would wish those who are interested in Mr. Palliser\'s fortunes\r\nto know the ultimate result of this adventure, and as we shall not\r\nhave space to return to his affairs in this little history, I may,\r\nperhaps, be allowed to press somewhat forward, and tell what Fortune\r\ndid for him before the close of that London season. Everybody knows\r\nthat in that spring Lady Glencora MacCluskie was brought out before\r\nthe world, and it is equally well known that she, as the only child\r\nof the late Lord of the Isles, was the great heiress of the day. It\r\nis true that the hereditary possession of Skye, Staffa, Mull, Arran,\r\nand Bute went, with the title, to the Marquis of Auldreekie, together\r\nwith the counties of Caithness and Ross-shire. But the property in\r\nFife, Aberdeen, Perth, and Kincardine-shire, comprising the greater\r\npart of those counties, and the coal-mines in Lanark, as well as the\r\nenormous estate within the city of Glasgow, were unentailed, and went\r\nto the Lady Glencora. She was a fair girl, with bright blue eyes\r\nand short wavy flaxen hair, very soft to the eye. The Lady Glencora\r\nwas small in stature, and her happy round face lacked, perhaps, the\r\nhighest grace of female beauty. But there was ever a smile upon it,\r\nat which it was very pleasant to look; and the intense interest\r\nwith which she would dance, and talk, and follow up every amusement\r\nthat was offered her, was very charming. The horse she rode was the\r\ndearest love--oh! she loved him so dearly! And she had a little\r\ndog that was almost as dear as the horse. The friend of her youth,\r\nSabrina Scott, was--oh, such a girl! And her cousin, the little Lord\r\nof the Isles, the heir of the marquis, was so gracious and beautiful\r\nthat she was always covering him with kisses. Unfortunately he was\r\nonly six, so that there was hardly a possibility that the properties\r\nshould be brought together.\r\n\r\nBut Lady Glencora, though she was so charming, had even in this, her\r\nfirst outset upon the world, given great uneasiness to her friends,\r\nand caused the Marquis of Auldreekie to be almost wild with dismay.\r\nThere was a terribly handsome man about town, who had spent every\r\nshilling that anybody would give him, who was very fond of brandy,\r\nwho was known, but not trusted, at Newmarket, who was said to be deep\r\nin every vice, whose father would not speak to him;--and with him the\r\nLady Glencora was never tired of dancing. One morning she had told\r\nher cousin the marquis, with a flashing eye,--for the round blue eye\r\ncould flash,--that Burgo Fitzgerald was more sinned against than\r\nsinning. Ah me! what was a guardian marquis, anxious for the fate of\r\nthe family property, to do under such circumstances as that?\r\n\r\nBut before the end of the season the marquis and the duke were\r\nboth happy men, and we will hope that the Lady Glencora also was\r\nsatisfied. Mr. Plantagenet Palliser had danced with her twice, and\r\nhad spoken his mind. He had an interview with the marquis, which was\r\npre-eminently satisfactory, and everything was settled. Glencora no\r\ndoubt told him how she had accepted that plain gold ring from Burgo\r\nFitzgerald, and how she had restored it; but I doubt whether she ever\r\ntold him of that wavy lock of golden hair which Burgo still keeps in\r\nhis receptacle for such treasures.\r\n\r\n"Plantagenet," said the duke, with quite unaccustomed warmth, "in\r\nthis, as in all things, you have shown yourself to be everything that\r\nI could desire. I have told the marquis that Matching Priory, with\r\nthe whole estate, should be given over to you at once. It is the most\r\ncomfortable country-house I know. Glencora shall have The Horns as\r\nher wedding present."\r\n\r\nBut the genial, frank delight of Mr. Fothergill pleased Mr. Palliser\r\nthe most. The heir of the Pallisers had done his duty, and Mr.\r\nFothergill was unfeignedly a happy man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nSHOWING HOW MR. CROSBIE BECAME AGAIN A HAPPY MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been told in the last chapter how Lady De Courcy gave a great\r\nparty in London in the latter days of April, and it may therefore be\r\nthought that things were going well with the De Courcys; but I fear\r\nthe inference would be untrue. At any rate, things were not going\r\nwell with Lady Alexandrina, for she, on her mother\'s first arrival in\r\ntown, had rushed to Portman-square with a long tale of her\r\nsufferings.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma! you would not believe it; but he hardly ever speaks to\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"My dear, there are worse faults in a man than that."\r\n\r\n"I am alone there all the day. I never get out. He never offers to\r\nget me a carriage. He asked me to walk with him once last week, when\r\nit was raining. I saw that he waited till the rain began. Only think,\r\nI have not been out three evenings this month,--except to Amelia\'s;\r\nand now he says he won\'t go there any more, because a fly is so\r\nexpensive. You can\'t believe how uncomfortable the house is."\r\n\r\n"I thought you chose it, my dear."\r\n\r\n"I looked at it, but, of course, I didn\'t know what a house ought\r\nto be. Amelia said it wasn\'t nice, but he would have it. He hates\r\nAmelia. I\'m sure of that, for he says everything he can to snub her\r\nand Mr. Gazebee. Mr. Gazebee is as good as he, at any rate. What do\r\nyou think? He has given Richard warning to go. You never saw him,\r\nbut he was a very good servant. He has given him warning, and he is\r\nnot talking of getting another man. I won\'t live with him without\r\nsomebody to wait upon me."\r\n\r\n"My dearest girl, do not think of such a thing as leaving him."\r\n\r\n"But I will think of it, mamma. You do not know what my life is in\r\nthat house. He never speaks to me,--never. He comes home before\r\ndinner at half-past six, and when he has just shown himself he goes\r\nto his dressing-room. He is always silent at dinner-time, and after\r\ndinner he goes to sleep. He breakfasts always at nine, and goes away\r\nat half-past nine, though I know he does not get to his office till\r\neleven. If I want anything, he says that it cannot be afforded. I\r\nnever thought before that he was stingy, but I am sure now that he\r\nmust be a miser at heart."\r\n\r\n"It is better so than a spendthrift, Alexandrina."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that it is better. He could not make me more unhappy\r\nthan I am. Unhappy is no word for it. What can I do, shut up in such\r\na house as that by myself from nine o\'clock in the morning till six\r\nin the evening? Everybody knows what he is, so that nobody will come\r\nto see me. I tell you fairly, mamma, I will not stand it. If you\r\ncannot help me, I will look for help elsewhere."\r\n\r\nIt may, at any rate, be said that things were not going well with\r\nthat branch of the De Courcy family. Nor, indeed, was it going well\r\nwith some other branches. Lord Porlock had married, not having\r\nselected his partner for life from the choicest cream of the\r\naristocratic circles, and his mother, while endeavouring to say a\r\nword in his favour, had been so abused by the earl that she had been\r\ndriven to declare that she could no longer endure such usage. She had\r\ncome up to London in direct opposition to his commands, while he was\r\nfastened to his room by gout; and had given her party in defiance of\r\nhim, so that people should not say, when her back was turned, that\r\nshe had slunk away in despair.\r\n\r\n"I have borne it," she said to Margaretta, "longer than any other\r\nwoman in England would have done. While I thought that any of you\r\nwould marry--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t talk of that, mamma," said Margaretta, putting a little\r\nscorn into her voice. She had not been quite pleased that even her\r\nmother should intimate that all her chance was over, and yet she\r\nherself had often told her mother that she had given up all thought\r\nof marrying.\r\n\r\n"Rosina will go to Amelia\'s," the countess continued; "Mr. Gazebee is\r\nquite satisfied that it should be so, and he will take care that she\r\nshall have enough to cover her own expenses. I propose that you and\r\nI, dear, shall go to Baden-Baden."\r\n\r\n"And about money, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Gazebee must manage it. In spite of all that your father says, I\r\nknow that there must be money. The expense will be much less so than\r\nin our present way."\r\n\r\n"And what will papa do himself?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot help it, my dear. No one knows what I have had to bear.\r\nAnother year of it would kill me. His language has become worse and\r\nworse, and I fear every day that he is going to strike me with his\r\ncrutch."\r\n\r\nUnder all these circumstances it cannot be said that the De Courcy\r\ninterests were prospering.\r\n\r\nBut Lady De Courcy, when she had made up her mind to go to\r\nBaden-Baden, had by no means intended to take her youngest daughter\r\nwith her. She had endured for years, and now Alexandrina was unable\r\nto endure for six months. Her chief grievance, moreover, was\r\nthis,--that her husband was silent. The mother felt that no woman had\r\na right to complain much of any such sorrow as that. If her earl had\r\nsinned only in that way, she would have been content to have remained\r\nby him till the last!\r\n\r\nAnd yet I do not know whether Alexandrina\'s life was not quite as\r\nhard as that of her mother. She barely exceeded the truth when\r\nshe said that he never spoke to her. The hours with her in her\r\nnew comfortless house were very long,--very long and very tedious.\r\nMarriage with her had by no means been the thing that she had\r\nexpected. At home, with her mother, there had always been people\r\naround her, but they had not always been such as she herself would\r\nhave chosen for her companions. She had thought that, when married,\r\nshe could choose and have those about her who were congenial to her;\r\nbut she found that none came to her. Her sister, who was a wiser\r\nwoman than she, had begun her married life with a definite idea, and\r\nhad carried it out; but this poor creature found herself, as it were,\r\nstranded. When once she had conceived it in her heart to feel anger\r\nagainst her husband,--and she had done so before they had been a week\r\ntogether,--there was no love to bring her back to him again. She did\r\nnot know that it behoved her to look pleased when he entered the\r\nroom, and to make him at any rate think that his presence gave her\r\nhappiness. She became gloomy before she reached her new house, and\r\nnever laid her gloom aside. He would have made a struggle for some\r\ndomestic comfort, had any seemed to be within his reach. As it was,\r\nhe struggled for domestic propriety, believing that he might so best\r\nbolster up his present lot in life. But the task became harder and\r\nharder to him, and the gloom became denser and more dense. He did not\r\nthink of her unhappiness, but of his own; as she did not think of his\r\ntedium, but of hers. "If this be domestic felicity!" he would say to\r\nhimself, as he sat in his arm-chair, striving to fix his attention\r\nupon a book.\r\n\r\n"If this be the happiness of married life!" she thought, as she\r\nremained listless, without even the pretence of a book, behind her\r\nteacups. In truth she would not walk with him, not caring for such\r\nexercise round the pavement of a London square; and he had resolutely\r\ndetermined that she should not run into debt for carriage hire. He\r\nwas not a curmudgeon with his money; he was no miser. But he had\r\nfound that in marrying an earl\'s daughter he had made himself a poor\r\nman, and he was resolved that he would not also be an embarrassed\r\nman.\r\n\r\nWhen the bride heard that her mother and sister were about to escape\r\nto Baden-Baden, there rushed upon her a sudden hope that she might\r\nbe able to accompany the flight. She would not be parted from her\r\nhusband, or at least not so parted that the world should suppose\r\nthat they had quarrelled. She would simply go away and make a long\r\nvisit,--a very long visit. Two years ago a sojourn with her mother\r\nand Margaretta at Baden-Baden would not have offered to her much that\r\nwas attractive; but now, in her eyes, such a life seemed to be a life\r\nin Paradise. In truth, the tedium of those hours in Princess Royal\r\nCrescent had been very heavy.\r\n\r\nBut how could she contrive that it should be so? That conversation\r\nwith her mother had taken place on the day preceding the party, and\r\nLady De Courcy had repeated it with dismay to Margaretta.\r\n\r\n"Of course he would allow her an income," Margaretta had coolly said.\r\n\r\n"But, my dear, they have been married only ten weeks."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why people are to be made absolutely wretched because\r\nthey are married," Margaretta answered. "I don\'t want to persuade her\r\nto leave him, but if what she says is true, it must be very\r\nuncomfortable."\r\n\r\nCrosbie had consented to go to the party in Portman-square, but had\r\nnot greatly enjoyed himself on that festive occasion. He had stood\r\nabout moodily, speaking hardly a word to any one. His whole aspect of\r\nlife seemed to have been altered during the last few months. It was\r\nhere, in such spots as this that he had been used to find his glory.\r\nOn such occasions he had shone with peculiar light, making envious\r\nthe hearts of many who watched the brilliance of his career as they\r\nstood around in dull quiescence. But now no one in those rooms had\r\nbeen more dull, more silent, or less courted than he; and yet he was\r\nestablished there as the son-in-law of that noble house. "Rather slow\r\nwork; isn\'t it?" Gazebee had said to him, having, after many efforts,\r\nsucceeded in reaching his brother-in-law in a corner. In answer to\r\nthis Crosbie had only grunted. "As for myself," continued Gazebee, "I\r\nwould a deal sooner be at home with my paper and slippers. It seems\r\nto me these sort of gatherings don\'t suit married men." Crosbie had\r\nagain grunted, and had then escaped into another corner.\r\n\r\nCrosbie and his wife went home together in a cab,--speechless both\r\nof them. Alexandrina hated cabs,--but she had been plainly told that\r\nin such vehicles, and in such vehicles only, could she be allowed\r\nto travel. On the following morning he was at the breakfast-table\r\npunctually by nine, but she did not make her appearance till after he\r\nhad gone to his office. Soon after that, however, she was away to her\r\nmother and her sister; but she was seated grimly in her drawing-room\r\nwhen he came in to see her, on his return to his house. Having said\r\nsome word which might be taken for a greeting, he was about to\r\nretire; but she stopped him with a request that he would speak to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said he. "I was only going to dress. It is nearly the\r\nhalf-hour."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t keep you very long, and if dinner is a few minutes late it\r\nwon\'t signify. Mamma and Margaretta are going to Baden-Baden."\r\n\r\n"To Baden-Baden, are they?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and they intend to remain there--for a considerable time."\r\nThere was a little pause, and Alexandrina found it necessary to clear\r\nher voice and to prepare herself for further speech by a little\r\ncough. She was determined to make her proposition, but was rather\r\nafraid of the manner in which it might be first received.\r\n\r\n"Has anything happened at Courcy Castle?" Crosbie asked.\r\n\r\n"No; that is, yes; there may have been some words between papa and\r\nmamma; but I don\'t quite know. That, however, does not matter now.\r\nMamma is going, and purposes to remain there for the rest of the\r\nyear."\r\n\r\n"And the house in town will be given up."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so, but that will be as papa chooses. Have you any\r\nobjection to my going with mamma?"\r\n\r\nWhat a question to be asked by a bride of ten weeks\' standing! She\r\nhad hardly been above a month with her husband in her new house, and\r\nshe was now asking permission to leave it, and to leave him also, for\r\nan indefinite number of months--perhaps for ever. But she showed no\r\nexcitement as she made her request. There was neither sorrow, nor\r\nregret, nor hope in her face. She had not put on half the animation\r\nwhich she had once assumed in asking for the use, twice a week,\r\nof a carriage done up to look as though it were her own private\r\npossession. Crosbie had then answered her with great sternness, and\r\nshe had wept when his refusal was made certain to her. But there was\r\nto be no weeping now. She meant to go,--with his permission if he\r\nwould accord it, and without it if he should refuse it. The question\r\nof money was no doubt important, but Gazebee should manage that,--as\r\nhe managed all those things.\r\n\r\n"Going with them to Baden-Baden?" said Crosbie. "For how long?"\r\n\r\n"Well; it would be no use unless it were for some time."\r\n\r\n"For how long a time do you mean, Alexandrina? Speak out what you\r\nreally have to say. For a month?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, more than that."\r\n\r\n"For two months, or six, or as long as they may stay there?"\r\n\r\n"We could settle that afterwards, when I am there." During all this\r\ntime she did not once look into his face, though he was looking hard\r\nat her throughout.\r\n\r\n"You mean," said he, "that you wish to go away from me."\r\n\r\n"In one sense it would be going away, certainly."\r\n\r\n"But in the ordinary sense? is it not so? When you talk of going to\r\nBaden-Baden for an unlimited number of months, have you any idea of\r\ncoming back again?"\r\n\r\n"Back to London, you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Back to me,--to my house,--to your duties as a wife! Why cannot you\r\nsay at once what it is you want? You wish to be separated from me?"\r\n\r\n"I am not happy here,--in this house."\r\n\r\n"And who chose the house? Did I want to come here? But it is not\r\nthat. If you are not happy here, what could you have in any other\r\nhouse to make you happy?"\r\n\r\n"If you were left alone in this room for seven or eight hours at a\r\ntime, without a soul to come to you, you would know what I mean. And\r\neven after that, it is not much better. You never speak to me when\r\nyou are here."\r\n\r\n"Is it my fault that nobody comes to you? The fact is, Alexandrina,\r\nthat you will not reconcile yourself to the manner of life which\r\nis suitable to my income. You are wretched because you cannot\r\nhave yourself driven round the Park. I cannot find you a carriage,\r\nand will not attempt to do so. You may go to Baden-Baden, if you\r\nplease;--that is, if your mother is willing to take you."\r\n\r\n"Of course I must pay my own expenses," said Alexandrina. But to\r\nthis he made no answer on the moment. As soon as he had given his\r\npermission he had risen from his seat and was going, and her last\r\nwords only caught him in the doorway. After all, would not this be\r\nthe cheapest arrangement that he could make? As he went through his\r\ncalculations he stood up with his elbow on the mantel-piece in his\r\ndressing-room. He had scolded his wife because she had been unhappy\r\nwith him; but had he not been quite as unhappy with her? Would it\r\nnot be better that they should part in this quiet, half-unnoticed\r\nway;--that they should part and never again come together? He was\r\nlucky in this, that hitherto had come upon them no prospect of any\r\nlittle Crosbie to mar the advantages of such an arrangement. If he\r\ngave her four hundred a year, and allowed Gazebee two more towards\r\nthe paying off of encumbrances, he would still have six on which to\r\nenjoy himself in London. Of course he could not live as he had lived\r\nin those happy days before his marriage, nor, independently of the\r\ncost, would such a mode of life be within his reach. But he might go\r\nto his club for his dinners; he might smoke his cigar in luxury; he\r\nwould not be bound to that wooden home which, in spite of all his\r\nresolutions, had become almost unendurable to him. So he made his\r\ncalculations, and found that it would be well that his bride should\r\ngo. He would give over his house and furniture to Gazebee, allowing\r\nGazebee to do as he would about that. To be once more a bachelor, in\r\nlodgings, with six hundred a year to spend on himself, seemed to him\r\nnow such a prospect of happiness that he almost became light-hearted\r\nas he dressed himself. He would let her go to Baden-Baden.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing said about it at dinner, nor did he mention the\r\nsubject again till the servant had left the tea-things on the\r\ndrawing-room table. "You can go with your mother if you like it," he\r\nthen said.\r\n\r\n"I think it will be best," she answered.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it will. At any rate you shall suit yourself."\r\n\r\n"And about money?"\r\n\r\n"You had better leave me to speak to Gazebee about that."\r\n\r\n"Very well. Will you have some tea?" And then the whole thing was\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nOn the next day she went after lunch to her mother\'s house, and never\r\ncame back again to Princess Royal Crescent. During that morning she\r\npacked up those things which she cared to pack herself, and sent her\r\nsisters there, with an old family servant, to bring away whatever\r\nelse might be supposed to belong to her. "Dear, dear," said Amelia,\r\n"what trouble I had in getting these things together for them, and\r\nonly the other day. I can\'t but think she\'s wrong to go away."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Margaretta. "She has not been so lucky as you\r\nhave in the man she has married. I always felt that she would find it\r\ndifficult to manage him."\r\n\r\n"But, my dear, she has not tried. She has given up at once. It isn\'t\r\nmanagement that was wanting. The fact is that when Alexandrina began\r\nshe didn\'t make up her mind to the kind of thing she was coming to.\r\nI did. I knew it wasn\'t to be all party-going and that sort of thing.\r\nBut I must own that Crosbie isn\'t the same sort of man as Mortimer.\r\nI don\'t think I could have gone on with him. You might as well have\r\nthose small books put up; he won\'t care about them." And in this way\r\nCrosbie\'s house was dismantled.\r\n\r\nShe saw him no more, for he made no farewell visit to the house in\r\nPortman Square. A note had been brought to him at his office: "I\r\nam here with mamma, and may as well say good-by now. We start on\r\nTuesday. If you wish to write, you can send your letters to the\r\nhousekeeper here. I hope you will make yourself comfortable, and that\r\nyou will be well. Yours affectionately, A. C." He made no answer to\r\nit, but went that day and dined at his club.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t seen you this age," said Montgomerie Dobbs.\r\n\r\n"No. My wife is going abroad with her mother, and while she is away I\r\nshall come back here again."\r\n\r\nThere was nothing more said to him, and no one ever made any inquiry\r\nabout his domestic affairs. It seemed to him now as though he had no\r\nfriend sufficiently intimate with him to ask him after his wife or\r\nfamily. She was gone, and in a month\'s time he found himself again in\r\nMount Street,--beginning the world with five hundred a year, not six.\r\nFor Mr. Gazebee, when the reckoning came, showed him that a larger\r\nincome at the present moment was not possible for him. The countess\r\nhad for a long time refused to let Lady Alexandrina go with her on so\r\nsmall a pittance as four hundred and fifty;--and then were there not\r\nthe insurances to be maintained?\r\n\r\nBut I think he would have consented to accept his liberty with three\r\nhundred a year,--so great to him was the relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nLILIAN DALE VANQUISHES HER MOTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale had been present during the interview in which John Eames\r\nhad made his prayer to her daughter, but she had said little or\r\nnothing on that occasion. All her wishes had been in favour of the\r\nsuitor, but she had not dared to express them, neither had she dared\r\nto leave the room. It had been hard upon him to be thus forced to\r\ndeclare his love in the presence of a third person, but he had done\r\nit, and had gone away with his answer. Then, when the thing was over,\r\nLily, without any communion with her mother, took herself off, and\r\nwas no more seen till the evening hours had come on, in which it was\r\nnatural that they should be together again. Mrs. Dale, when thus\r\nalone, had been able to think of nothing but this new suit for her\r\ndaughter\'s hand. If only it might be accomplished! If any words from\r\nher to Lily might be efficacious to such an end! And yet, hitherto,\r\nshe had been afraid almost to utter a word.\r\n\r\nShe knew that it was very difficult. She declared to herself over\r\nand over that he had come too soon,--that the attempt had been made\r\ntoo quickly after that other shipwreck. How was it possible that the\r\nship should put to sea again at once, with all her timbers so rudely\r\nstrained? And yet, now that the attempt had been made, now that Eames\r\nhad uttered his request and been sent away with an answer, she felt\r\nthat she must at once speak to Lily on the subject, if ever she were\r\nto speak upon it. She thought that she understood her child and all\r\nher feelings. She recognized the violence of the shock which must be\r\nencountered before Lily could be brought to acknowledge such a change\r\nin her heart. But if the thing could be done, Lily would be a happy\r\nwoman. When once done it would be in all respects a blessing. And\r\nif it were not done, might not Lily\'s life be blank, lonely, and\r\nloveless to the end? Yet when Lily came down in the evening, with\r\nsome light, half-joking word on her lips, as was usual to her, Mrs.\r\nDale was still afraid to venture upon her task.\r\n\r\n"I suppose, mamma, we may consider it as a settled thing that\r\neverything must be again unpacked, and that the lodging scheme will\r\nbe given up."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I do--after what you said just now. What geese everybody\r\nwill think us!"\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t care a bit for that, if we didn\'t think ourselves geese,\r\nor if your uncle did not think us so."\r\n\r\n"I believe he would think we were swans. If I had ever thought he\r\nwould be so much in earnest about it, or that he would ever have\r\ncared about our being here, I would never have voted for going. But\r\nhe is so strange. He is affectionate when he ought to be angry, and\r\nill-natured when he ought to be gentle and kind."\r\n\r\n"He has, at any rate, given us reason to feel sure of his affection."\r\n\r\n"For us girls, I never doubted it. But, mamma, I don\'t think I could\r\nface Mrs. Boyce. Mrs. Hearn and Mrs. Crump would be very bad, and\r\nHopkins would come down upon us terribly when he found that we had\r\ngiven way. But Mrs. Boyce would be worse than any of them. Can\'t you\r\nfancy the tone of her congratulations?"\r\n\r\n"I think I should survive Mrs. Boyce."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; because we should have to go and tell her. I know your\r\ncowardice of old, mamma; don\'t I? And Bell wouldn\'t care a bit,\r\nbecause of her lover. Mrs. Boyce will be nothing to her. It is I that\r\nmust bear it all. Well, I don\'t mind; I\'ll vote for staying if you\r\nwill promise to be happy here. Oh, mamma, I\'ll vote for anything if\r\nyou will be happy."\r\n\r\n"And will you be happy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, as happy as the day is long. Only I know we shall never see\r\nBell. People never do see each other when they live just at that\r\ndistance. It\'s too near for long visits, and too far for short\r\nvisits. I\'ll tell you what; we might make arrangements each to walk\r\nhalf-way, and meet at the corner of Lord De Guest\'s wood. I wonder\r\nwhether they\'d let us put up a seat there. I think we might have a\r\nlittle house and carry sandwiches and a bottle of beer. Couldn\'t we\r\nsee something of each other in that way?"\r\n\r\nThus it came to be the fixed idea of both of them that they would\r\nabandon their plan of migrating to Guestwick, and on this subject\r\nthey continued to talk over their tea-table; but on that evening Mrs.\r\nDale ventured to say nothing about John Eames.\r\n\r\nBut they did not even yet dare to commence the work of reconstructing\r\ntheir old home. Bell must come back before they would do that, and\r\nthe express assent of the squire must be formally obtained. Mrs. Dale\r\nmust, in a degree, acknowledge herself to have been wrong, and ask to\r\nbe forgiven for her contumacy.\r\n\r\n"I suppose the three of us had better go up in sackcloth, and throw\r\nashes on our foreheads as we meet Hopkins in the garden," said Lily,\r\n"and then I know he\'ll heap coals of fire on our heads by sending us\r\nan early dish of peas. And Dingles would bring us in a pheasant, only\r\nthat pheasants don\'t grow in May."\r\n\r\n"If the sackcloth doesn\'t take an unpleasanter shape than that, I\r\nshan\'t mind it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s because you\'ve got no delicate feelings. And then uncle\r\nChristopher\'s gratitude!"\r\n\r\n"Ah! I shall feel that."\r\n\r\n"But, mamma, we\'ll wait till Bell comes home. She shall decide. She\r\nis going away, and therefore she\'ll be free from prejudice. If uncle\r\noffers to paint the house,--and I know he will,--then I shall be\r\nhumbled to the dust."\r\n\r\nBut yet Mrs. Dale had said nothing on the subject which was nearest\r\nto her heart. When Lily in pleasantry had accused her of cowardice,\r\nher mind had instantly gone off to that other matter, and she had\r\ntold herself that she was a coward. Why should she be afraid of\r\noffering her counsel to her own child? It seemed to her as though she\r\nhad neglected some duty in allowing Crosbie\'s conduct to have passed\r\naway without hardly a word of comment on it between herself and Lily.\r\nShould she not have forced upon her daughter\'s conviction the fact\r\nthat Crosbie had been a villain, and as such should be discarded from\r\nher heart? As it was, Lily had spoken the simple truth when she told\r\nJohn Eames that she was dealing more openly with him on that affair\r\nof her engagement than she had ever dealt, even with her mother.\r\nThinking of this as she sat in her own room that night, before she\r\nallowed herself to rest, Mrs. Dale resolved that on the next morning\r\nshe would endeavour to make Lily see as she saw and think as she\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nShe let breakfast pass by before she began her task, and even then\r\nshe did not rush at it at once. Lily sat herself down to her work\r\nwhen the teacups were taken away, and Mrs. Dale went down to her\r\nkitchen as was her wont. It was nearly eleven before she seated\r\nherself in the parlour, and even then she got her work-box before her\r\nand took out her needle.\r\n\r\n"I wonder how Bell gets on with Lady Julia," said Lily.\r\n\r\n"Very well, I\'m sure."\r\n\r\n"Lady Julia won\'t bite her, I know, and I suppose her dismay at the\r\ntall footmen has passed off by this time."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that they have any tall footmen."\r\n\r\n"Short footmen then,--you know what I mean; all the noble belongings.\r\nThey must startle one at first, I\'m sure, let one determine ever so\r\nmuch not to be startled. It\'s a very mean thing, no doubt, to be\r\nafraid of a lord merely because he is a lord; yet I\'m sure I should\r\nbe afraid at first, even of Lord De Guest, if I were staying in the\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"It\'s well you didn\'t go then."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think it is. Bell is of a firmer mind, and I dare say she\'ll\r\nget over it after the first day. But what on earth does she do there?\r\nI wonder whether they mend their stockings in such a house as that."\r\n\r\n"Not in public, I should think."\r\n\r\n"In very grand houses they throw them away at once, I suppose. I\'ve\r\noften thought about it. Do you believe the Prime Minister ever has\r\nhis shoes sent to a cobbler?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps a regular shoemaker will condescend to mend a Prime\r\nMinister\'s shoes."\r\n\r\n"You do think they are mended then? But who orders it? Does he\r\nsee himself when there\'s a little hole coming, as I do? Does an\r\narchbishop allow himself so many pairs of gloves in a year?"\r\n\r\n"Not very strictly, I should think."\r\n\r\n"Then I suppose it comes to this, that he has a new pair whenever\r\nhe wants them. But what constitutes the want? Does he ever say to\r\nhimself that they\'ll do for another Sunday? I remember the bishop\r\ncoming here once, and he had a hole at the end of his thumb. I was\r\ngoing to be confirmed, and I remember thinking that he ought to have\r\nbeen smarter."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you offer to mend it?"\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t have dared for all the world."\r\n\r\nThe conversation had commenced itself in a manner that did not\r\npromise much assistance to Mrs. Dale\'s project. When Lily got upon\r\nany subject, she was not easily induced to leave it, and when her\r\nmind had twisted itself in one direction, it was difficult to untwist\r\nit. She was now bent on a consideration of the smaller social habits\r\nof the high and mighty among us, and was asking her mother whether\r\nshe supposed that the royal children ever carried halfpence in their\r\npockets, or descended so low as fourpenny-bits.\r\n\r\n"I suppose they have pockets like other children," said Lily.\r\n\r\nBut her mother stopped her suddenly,--\r\n\r\n"Lily, dear, I want to say something to you about John Eames."\r\n\r\n"Mamma, I\'d sooner talk about the Royal Family just at present."\r\n\r\n"But, dear, you must forgive me if I persist. I have thought much\r\nabout it, and I\'m sure you will not oppose me when I am doing what\r\nI think to be my duty."\r\n\r\n"No, mamma; I won\'t oppose you, certainly."\r\n\r\n"Since Mr. Crosbie\'s conduct was made known to you, I have mentioned\r\nhis name in your hearing very seldom."\r\n\r\n"No, mamma, you have not. And I have loved you so dearly for your\r\ngoodness to me. Do not think that I have not understood and known how\r\ngenerous you have been. No other mother ever was so good as you have\r\nbeen. I have known it all, and thought of it every day of my life,\r\nand thanked you in my heart for your trusting silence. Of course, I\r\nunderstand your feelings. You think him bad and you hate him for what\r\nhe has done."\r\n\r\n"I would not willingly hate any one, Lily."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but you do hate him. If I were you, I should hate him; but I am\r\nnot you, and I love him. I pray for his happiness every night and\r\nmorning, and for hers. I have forgiven him altogether, and I think\r\nthat he was right. When I am old enough to do so without being wrong,\r\nI will go to him and tell him so. I should like to hear of all his\r\ndoings and all his success, if it were only possible. How, then, can\r\nyou and I talk about him? It is impossible. You have been silent and\r\nI have been silent,--let us remain silent."\r\n\r\n"It is not about Mr. Crosbie that I wish to speak. But I think you\r\nought to understand that conduct such as his will be rebuked by all\r\nthe world. You may forgive him, but you should acknowledge--"\r\n\r\n"Mamma, I don\'t want to acknowledge anything;--not about him. There\r\nare things as to which a person cannot argue." Mrs. Dale felt\r\nthat this present matter was one as to which she could not argue.\r\n"Of course, mamma," continued Lily, "I don\'t want to oppose you in\r\nanything, but I think we had better be silent about this."\r\n\r\n"Of course I am thinking only of your future happiness."\r\n\r\n"I know you are; but pray believe me that you need not be alarmed.\r\nI do not mean to be unhappy. Indeed, I think I may say I am not\r\nunhappy; of course I have been unhappy,--very unhappy. I did think\r\nthat my heart would break. But that has passed away, and I believe I\r\ncan be as happy as my neighbours. We\'re all of us sure to have some\r\ntroubles, as you used to tell us when we were children."\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale felt that she had begun wrong, and that she would have been\r\nable to make better progress had she omitted all mention of Crosbie\'s\r\nname. She knew exactly what it was that she wished to say,--what were\r\nthe arguments which she desired to expound before her daughter; but\r\nshe did not know what language to use, or how she might best put her\r\nthoughts into words. She paused for a while, and Lily went on with\r\nher work as though the conversation was over. But the conversation\r\nwas not over.\r\n\r\n"It was about John Eames, and not about Mr. Crosbie, that I wished to\r\nspeak to you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma!"\r\n\r\n"My dear, you must not hinder me in doing what I think to be a duty.\r\nI heard what he said to you and what you replied, and of course I\r\ncannot but have my mind full of the subject. Why should you set\r\nyourself against him in so fixed a manner?"\r\n\r\n"Because I love another man." These words she spoke out loud, in a\r\nsteady, almost dogged tone, with a certain show of audacity,--as\r\nthough aware that the declaration was unseemly, but resolved that,\r\nthough unseemly, it must be made.\r\n\r\n"But, Lily, that love, from its very nature, must cease; or, rather,\r\nsuch love is not the same as that you felt when you thought that you\r\nwere to be his wife."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is. If she died, and he came to me in five years\' time, I\r\nwould still take him. I should think myself constrained to take him."\r\n\r\n"But she is not dead, nor likely to die."\r\n\r\n"That makes no difference. You don\'t understand me, mamma."\r\n\r\n"I think I do, and I want you to understand me also. I know how\r\ndifficult is your position; I know what your feelings are; but I know\r\nthis also, that if you could reason with yourself, and bring yourself\r\nin time to receive John Eames as a dear friend--"\r\n\r\n"I did receive him as a dear friend. Why not? He is a dear friend. I\r\nlove him heartily,--as you do."\r\n\r\n"You know what I mean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do; and I tell you it is impossible."\r\n\r\n"If you would make the attempt, all this misery would soon be\r\nforgotten. If once you could bring yourself to regard him as\r\na friend, who might become your husband, all this would be\r\nchanged,--and I should see you happy!"\r\n\r\n"You are strangely anxious to be rid of me, mamma!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Lily;--to be rid of you in that way. If I could see you put\r\nyour hand in his as his promised wife, I think that I should be the\r\nhappiest woman in the world."\r\n\r\n"Mamma, I cannot make you happy in that way. If you really understood\r\nmy feelings, my doing as you propose would make you very unhappy. I\r\nshould commit a great sin,--the sin against which women should be\r\nmore guarded than against any other. In my heart I am married to that\r\nother man. I gave myself to him, and loved him, and rejoiced in his\r\nlove. When he kissed me I kissed him again, and I longed for his\r\nkisses. I seemed to live only that he might caress me. All that time\r\nI never felt myself to be wrong,--because he was all in all to me. I\r\nwas his own. That has been changed,--to my great misfortune; but it\r\ncannot be undone or forgotten. I cannot be the girl I was before he\r\ncame here. There are things that will not have themselves buried and\r\nput out of sight, as though they had never been. I am as you are,\r\nmamma,--widowed. But you have your daughter, and I have my mother. If\r\nyou will be contented, so will I." Then she got up and threw herself\r\non her mother\'s neck.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dale\'s argument was over now. To such an appeal as that last\r\nmade by Lily no rejoinder on her part was possible. After that she\r\nwas driven to acknowledge to herself that she must be silent. Years\r\nas they rolled on might make a change, but no reasoning could be of\r\navail. She embraced her daughter, weeping over her,--whereas Lily\'s\r\neyes were dry. "It shall be as you will," Mrs. Dale murmured.\r\n\r\n"Yes, as I will. I shall have my own way; shall I not? That is all\r\nI want; to be a tyrant over you, and make you do my bidding in\r\neverything, as a well-behaved mother should do. But I won\'t be stern\r\nin my orderings. If you will only be obedient, I will be so gracious\r\nto you! There\'s Hopkins again. I wonder whether he has come to knock\r\nus down and trample upon us with another speech."\r\n\r\nHopkins knew very well to which window he must come, as only one\r\nof the rooms was at the present time habitable. He came up to the\r\ndining-room, and almost flattened his nose against the glass.\r\n\r\n"Well, Hopkins," said Lily, "here we are." Mrs. Dale had turned her\r\nface away, for she knew that the tears were still on her cheek.\r\n\r\n"Yes, miss, I see you. I want to speak to your mamma, miss."\r\n\r\n"Come round," said Lily, anxious to spare her mother the necessity\r\nof showing herself at once. "It\'s too cold to open the window; come\r\nround, and I\'ll open the door."\r\n\r\n"Too cold!" muttered Hopkins, as he went. "They\'ll find it a deal\r\ncolder in lodgings at Guestwick." However, he went round through the\r\nkitchen, and Lily met him in the hall.\r\n\r\n"Well, Hopkins, what is it? Mamma has got a headache."\r\n\r\n"Got a headache, has she? I won\'t make her headache no worse. It\'s\r\nmy opinion that there\'s nothing for a headache so good as fresh air.\r\nOnly some people can\'t abear to be blowed upon, not for a minute. If\r\nyou don\'t let down the lights in a greenhouse more or less every day,\r\nyou\'ll never get any plants,--never;--and it\'s just the same with the\r\ngrapes. Is I to go back and say as how I couldn\'t see her?"\r\n\r\n"You can come in if you like; only be quiet, you know."\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t I ollays quiet, miss? Did anybody ever hear me rampage? If you\r\nplease, ma\'am, the squire\'s come home."\r\n\r\n"What, home from Guestwick? Has he brought Miss Bell?"\r\n\r\n"He ain\'t brought none but hisself, \'cause he come on horseback; and\r\nit\'s my belief he\'s going back almost immediate. But he wants you to\r\ncome to him, Mrs. Dale."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I\'ll come at once."\r\n\r\n"He bade me say with his kind love. I don\'t know whether that makes\r\nany difference."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, I\'ll come, Hopkins."\r\n\r\n"And I ain\'t to say nothing about the headache?"\r\n\r\n"About what?" said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"No, no, no," said Lily. "Mamma will be there at once. Go and tell my\r\nuncle, there\'s a good man," and she put up her hand and backed him\r\nout of the room.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe she\'s got no headache at all," said Hopkins,\r\ngrumbling, as he returned through the back premises. "What lies\r\ngentlefolks do tell! If I said I\'d a headache when I ought to be out\r\namong the things, what would they say to me? But a poor man mustn\'t\r\nnever lie, nor yet drink, nor yet do nothing." And so he went back\r\nwith his message.\r\n\r\n"What can have brought your uncle home?" said Mrs. Dale.\r\n\r\n"Just to look after the cattle, and to see that the pigs are not all\r\ndead. My wonder is that he should ever have gone away."\r\n\r\n"I must go up to him at once."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, of course."\r\n\r\n"And what shall I say about the house?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s not about that,--at least I think not. I don\'t think he\'ll\r\nspeak about that again till you speak to him."\r\n\r\n"But if he does?"\r\n\r\n"You must put your trust in Providence. Declare you\'ve got a bad\r\nheadache, as I told Hopkins just now; only you would throw me over by\r\nnot understanding. I\'ll walk with you down to the bridge." So they\r\nwent off together across the lawn.\r\n\r\nBut Lily was soon left alone, and continued her walk, waiting for\r\nher mother\'s return. As she went round and round the gravel paths,\r\nshe thought of the words that she had said to her mother. She had\r\ndeclared that she also was widowed. "And so it should be," she\r\nsaid, debating the matter with herself. "What can a heart be worth\r\nif it can be transferred hither and thither as circumstances and\r\nconvenience and comfort may require? When he held me here in his\r\narms"--and, as the thoughts ran through her brain, she remembered the\r\nvery spot on which they had stood--"oh, my love!" she had said to him\r\nthen as she returned his kisses--"oh, my love, my love, my love!"\r\n"When he held me here in his arms, I told myself that it was right,\r\nbecause he was my husband. He has changed, but I have not. It might\r\nbe that I should have ceased to love him, and then I should have told\r\nhim so. I should have done as he did." But, as she came to this, she\r\nshuddered, thinking of the Lady Alexandrina. "It was very quick," she\r\nsaid, still speaking to herself; "very, very. But then men are not\r\nthe same as women." And she walked on eagerly, hardly remembering\r\nwhere she was, thinking over it all, as she did daily; remembering\r\nevery little thought and word of those few eventful months in which\r\nshe had learned to regard Crosbie as her husband and master. She\r\nhad declared that she had conquered her unhappiness; but there were\r\nmoments in which she was almost wild with misery. "Tell me to forget\r\nhim!" she said. "It is the one thing which will never be forgotten."\r\n\r\nAt last she heard her mother\'s step coming down across the squire\'s\r\ngarden, and she took up her post at the bridge.\r\n\r\n"Stand and deliver," she said, as her mother put her foot upon the\r\nplank. "That is, if you\'ve got anything worth delivering. Is anything\r\nsettled?"\r\n\r\n"Come up to the house," said Mrs. Dale, "and I\'ll tell you all."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE FATE OF THE SMALL HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION: (untitled)]\r\n\r\nThere was something in the tone of Mrs. Dale\'s voice, as she desired\r\nher daughter to come up to the house, and declared that her budget of\r\nnews should be opened there, which at once silenced Lily\'s assumed\r\npleasantry. Her mother had been away fully two hours, during which\r\nLily had still continued her walk round the garden, till at last she\r\nhad become impatient for her mother\'s footstep. Something serious\r\nmust have been said between her uncle and her mother during those\r\nlong two hours. The interviews to which Mrs. Dale was occasionally\r\nsummoned at the Great House did not usually exceed twenty minutes,\r\nand the upshot would be communicated to the girls in a turn or two\r\nround the garden; but in the present instance Mrs. Dale positively\r\ndeclined to speak till she was seated within the house.\r\n\r\n"Did he come over on purpose to see you, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear, I believe so. He wished to see you, too; but I asked\r\nhis permission to postpone that till after I had talked to you."\r\n\r\n"To see me, mamma? About what?"\r\n\r\n"To kiss you, and bid you love him; solely for that. He has not a\r\nword to say to you that will vex you."\r\n\r\n"Then I will kiss him, and love him, too."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you will when I have told you all. I have promised him solemnly\r\nto give up all idea of going to Guestwick. So that is over."\r\n\r\n"Oh, oh! And we may begin to unpack at once? What an episode in one\'s\r\nlife!"\r\n\r\n"We may certainly unpack, for I have pledged myself to him; and he is\r\nto go into Guestwick himself and arrange about the lodgings."\r\n\r\n"Does Hopkins know it?"\r\n\r\n"I should think not yet."\r\n\r\n"Nor Mrs. Boyce! Mamma, I don\'t believe I shall be able to survive\r\nthis next week. We shall look such fools! I\'ll tell you what we\'ll\r\ndo;--it will be the only comfort I can have;--we\'ll go to work and\r\nget everything back into its place before Bell comes home, so as to\r\nsurprise her."\r\n\r\n"What! in two days?"\r\n\r\n"Why not? I\'ll make Hopkins come and help, and then he\'ll not be so\r\nbad. I\'ll begin at once and go to the blankets and beds, because I\r\ncan undo them myself."\r\n\r\n"But I haven\'t half told you all; and, indeed, I don\'t know how to\r\nmake you understand what passed between us. He is very unhappy about\r\nBernard; Bernard has determined to go abroad, and may be away for\r\nyears."\r\n\r\n"One can hardly blame a man for following up his profession."\r\n\r\n"There was no blaming. He only said that it was very sad for him\r\nthat, in his old age, he should be left alone. This was before there\r\nwas any talk about our remaining. Indeed he seemed determined not\r\nto ask that again as a favour. I could see that in his eye, and I\r\nunderstood it from his tone. He went on to speak of you and Bell,\r\nsaying how well he loved you both; but that, unfortunately, his hopes\r\nregarding you had not been fulfilled."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but he shouldn\'t have had hopes of that sort."\r\n\r\n"Listen, my dear, and I think that you will not feel angry with\r\nhim. He said that he felt his house had never been pleasant to you.\r\nThen there followed words which I could not repeat, even if I could\r\nremember them. He said much about myself, regretting that the feeling\r\nbetween us had not been more kindly. \'But my heart,\' he said, \'has\r\never been kinder than my words.\' Then I got up from where I was\r\nseated, and going over to him, I told him that we would remain here."\r\n\r\n"And what did he say?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what he said. I know that I was crying, and that he\r\nkissed me. It was the first time in his life. I know that he was\r\npleased,--beyond measure pleased. After a while he became animated,\r\nand talked of doing ever so many things. He promised that very\r\npainting of which you spoke."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes, I knew it; and Hopkins will be here with the peas before\r\ndinner-time to-morrow, and Dingles with his shoulders smothered with\r\nrabbits. And then Mrs. Boyce! Mamma, he didn\'t think of Mrs. Boyce;\r\nor, in very charity of heart, he would still have maintained his\r\nsadness."\r\n\r\n"Then he did not think of her; for when I left him he was not at all\r\nsad. But I haven\'t told you half yet."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, mamma; was there more than that?"\r\n\r\n"And I\'ve told it all wrong; for what I\'ve got to tell now was said\r\nbefore a word was spoken about the house. He brought it in just after\r\nwhat he said about Bernard. He said that Bernard would, of course, be\r\nhis heir."\r\n\r\n"Of course he will."\r\n\r\n"And that he should think it wrong to encumber the property with any\r\ncharges for you girls."\r\n\r\n"Mamma, did any one ever--"\r\n\r\n"Stop, Lily, stop; and make your heart kinder towards him if you\r\ncan."\r\n\r\n"It is kind; only I hate to be told that I\'m not to have a lot of\r\nmoney, as though I had ever shown a desire for it. I have never\r\nenvied Bernard his man-servant, or his maid-servant, or his ox, or\r\nhis ass, or anything that is his. To tell the truth I didn\'t even\r\nwish it to be Bell\'s, because I knew well that there was somebody she\r\nwould like a great deal better than ever she could like Bernard."\r\n\r\n"I shall never get to the end of my story."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you will, mamma, if you persevere."\r\n\r\n"The long and the short of it is this, that he has given Bell three\r\nthousand pounds, and has given you three thousand also."\r\n\r\n"But why me, mamma?" said Lily, and the colour of her cheeks became\r\nred as she spoke. There should if possible be nothing more said about\r\nJohn Eames; but whatever might or might not be the necessity of\r\nspeaking, at any rate, let there be no mistake. "But why me, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Because, as he explained to me, he thinks it right to do the same\r\nby each of you. The money is yours at this moment,--to buy hair-pins\r\nwith, if you please. I had no idea that he could command so large a\r\nsum."\r\n\r\n"Three thousand pounds! The last money he gave me was half-a-crown,\r\nand I thought that he was so stingy! I particularly wanted ten\r\nshillings. I should have liked it so much better now if he had given\r\nme a nice new five-pound note."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better tell him so."\r\n\r\n"No; because then he\'d give me that too. But with five pounds I\r\nshould have the feeling that I might do what I liked with it;--buy a\r\ndressing-case, and a thing for a squirrel to run round in. But nobody\r\never gives girls money like that, so that they can enjoy it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lily; you ungrateful child!"\r\n\r\n"No, I deny it. I\'m not ungrateful. I\'m very grateful, because his\r\nheart was softened--and because he cried and kissed you. I\'ll be ever\r\nso good to him! But how I\'m to thank him for giving me three thousand\r\npounds, I cannot think. It\'s a sort of thing altogether beyond my\r\nline of life. It sounds like something that\'s to come to me in\r\nanother world, but which I don\'t want quite yet. I am grateful, but\r\nwith a misty, mazy sort of gratitude. Can you tell me how soon I\r\nshall have a new pair of Balmoral boots because of this money? If\r\nthat were brought home to me I think it would enliven my gratitude."\r\n\r\nThe squire, as he rode back to Guestwick, fell again from that\r\nanimation, which Mrs. Dale had described, into his natural sombre\r\nmood. He thought much of his past life, declaring to himself the\r\ntruth of those words in which he had told his sister-in-law that his\r\nheart had ever been kinder than his words. But the world, and all\r\nthose nearest to him in the world, had judged him always by his words\r\nrather than by his heart. They had taken the appearance, which he\r\ncould not command or alter, rather than the facts, of which he had\r\nbeen the master. Had he not been good to all his relations?--and yet\r\nwas there one among them that cared for him? "I\'m almost sorry that\r\nthey are going to stay," he said to himself;--"I know that I shall\r\ndisappoint them." Yet when he met Bell at the Manor House he accosted\r\nher cheerily, telling her with much appearance of satisfaction that\r\nthat flitting into Guestwick was not to be accomplished.\r\n\r\n"I am so glad," said she. "It is long since I wished it."\r\n\r\n"And I do not think your mother wishes it now."\r\n\r\n"I am sure she does not. It was all a misunderstanding from the\r\nfirst. When some of us could not do all that you wished, we thought\r\nit better--" Then Bell paused, finding that she would get herself\r\ninto a mess if she persevered.\r\n\r\n"We will not say any more about it," said the squire. "The thing is\r\nover, and I am very glad that it should be so pleasantly settled. I\r\nwas talking to Dr. Crofts yesterday."\r\n\r\n"Were you, uncle?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and he is to come and stay with me the day before he is\r\nmarried. We have arranged it all. And we\'ll have the breakfast up at\r\nthe Great House. Only you must fix the day. I should say some time in\r\nMay. And, my dear, you\'ll want to make yourself fine; here\'s a little\r\nmoney for you. You are to spend that before your marriage, you know."\r\nThen he shambled away, and as soon as he was alone, again became sad\r\nand despondent. He was a man for whom we may predicate some gentle\r\nsadness and continued despondency to the end of his life\'s chapter.\r\n\r\nWe left John Eames in the custody of Lady Julia, who had overtaken\r\nhim in the act of erasing Lily\'s name from the railing which ran\r\nacross the brook. He had been premeditating an escape home to his\r\nmother\'s house in Guestwick, and thence back to London, without\r\nmaking any further appearance at the Manor House. But as soon as he\r\nheard Lady Julia\'s step, and saw her figure close upon him, he knew\r\nthat his retreat was cut off from him. So he allowed himself to be\r\nled away quietly up to the house. With Lady Julia herself he openly\r\ndiscussed the whole matter,--telling her that his hopes were over,\r\nhis happiness gone, and his heart half-broken. Though he would\r\nperhaps have cared but little for her congratulations in success, he\r\ncould make himself more amenable to consolation and sympathy from her\r\nthan from any other inmate in the earl\'s house. "I don\'t know what I\r\nshall say to your brother," he whispered to her, as they approached\r\nthe side door at which she intended to enter.\r\n\r\n"Will you let me break it to him? After that he will say a few words\r\nto you of course, but you need not be afraid of him."\r\n\r\n"And Mr. Dale?" said Johnny. "Everybody has heard about it. Everybody\r\nwill know what a fool I have made myself." She suggested that the\r\nearl should speak to the squire, assured him that nobody would think\r\nhim at all foolish, and then left him to make his way up to his own\r\nbedroom. When there he found a letter from Cradell, which had been\r\ndelivered in his absence; but the contents of that letter may best be\r\ndeferred to the next chapter. They were not of a nature to give him\r\ncomfort or to add to his sorrow.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour before dinner there was a knock at his door, and the\r\nearl himself, when summoned, made his appearance in the room. He was\r\ndressed in his usual farming attire, having been caught by Lady Julia\r\non his first approach to the house, and had come away direct to his\r\nyoung friend, after having been duly trained in what he ought to say\r\nby his kind-hearted sister. I am not, however, prepared to declare\r\nthat he strictly followed his sister\'s teaching in all that he said\r\nupon the occasion.\r\n\r\n"Well, my boy," he began, "so the young lady has been perverse."\r\n\r\n"Yes, my lord. That is, I don\'t know about being perverse. It is all\r\nover."\r\n\r\n"That\'s as may be, Johnny. As far as I know, not half of them accept\r\ntheir lovers the first time of asking."\r\n\r\n"I shall not ask her again."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, you will. You don\'t mean to say you are angry with her for\r\nrefusing you."\r\n\r\n"Not in the least. I have no right to be angry. I am only angry with\r\nmyself for being such a fool, Lord De Guest. I wish I had been dead\r\nbefore I came down here on this errand. Now I think of it, I know\r\nthere are so many things which ought to have made me sure how it\r\nwould be."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that at all. You come down again,--let me see,--it\'s May\r\nnow. Say you come when the shooting begins in September. If we can\'t\r\nget you leave of absence in any other way, we\'ll make old Buffle come\r\ntoo. Only, by George, I believe he\'d shoot us all. But never mind;\r\nwe\'ll manage that. You keep up your spirits till September, and then\r\nwe\'ll fight the battle in another way. The squire shall get up a\r\nlittle party for the bride, and my lady Lily must go then. You shall\r\nmeet her so; and then we\'ll shoot over the squire\'s land. We\'ll bring\r\nyou together so; you see if we don\'t. Lord bless me! Refused once! My\r\nbelief is, that in these days a girl thinks nothing of a man till she\r\nhas refused him half-a-dozen times."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think Lily is at all like that."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Johnny. I have not a word to say against Miss Lily. I\r\nlike her very much, and think her one of the nicest girls I know.\r\nWhen she\'s your wife, I\'ll love her dearly, if she\'ll let me. But\r\nshe\'s made of the same stuff as other girls, and will act in the same\r\nway. Things have gone a little astray among you, and they won\'t right\r\nthemselves all in a minute. She knows now what your feelings are, and\r\nshe\'ll go on thinking of it, till at last you\'ll be in her thoughts\r\nmore than that other fellow. Don\'t tell me about her becoming an old\r\nmaid, because at her time of life she has been so unfortunate as to\r\ncome across a false-hearted man like that. It may take a little time;\r\nbut if you\'ll carry on and not be down-hearted, you\'ll find it will\r\nall come right in the end. Everybody doesn\'t get all that they want\r\nin a minute. How I shall quiz you about all this when you have been\r\ntwo or three years married!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I shall ever be able to ask her again; and I feel\r\nsure, if I do, that her answer will be the same. She told me in so\r\nmany words--; but never mind, I cannot repeat her words."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want you to repeat them; nor yet to heed them beyond their\r\nworth. Lily Dale is a very pretty girl; clever, too, I believe, and\r\ngood, I\'m sure; but her words are not more sacred than those of other\r\nmen or women. What she has said to you now, she means, no doubt; but\r\nthe minds of men and women are prone to change, especially when such\r\nchanges are conducive to their own happiness."\r\n\r\n"At any rate I\'ll never forget your kindness, Lord De Guest."\r\n\r\n"And there is one other thing I want to say to you, Johnny. A\r\nman should never allow himself to be cast down by anything,--not\r\noutwardly, to the eyes of other men."\r\n\r\n"But how is he to help it?"\r\n\r\n"His pluck should prevent him. You were not afraid of a roaring bull,\r\nnor yet of that man when you thrashed him at the railway station.\r\nYou\'ve pluck enough of that kind. You must now show that you\'ve that\r\nother kind of pluck. You know the story of the boy who would not cry\r\nthough the wolf was gnawing him underneath his frock. Most of us have\r\nsome wolf to gnaw us somewhere; but we are generally gnawed beneath\r\nour clothes, so that the world doesn\'t see; and it behoves us so to\r\nbear it that the world shall not suspect. The man who goes about\r\ndeclaring himself to be miserable will be not only miserable, but\r\ncontemptible as well."\r\n\r\n"But the wolf hasn\'t gnawed me beneath my clothes; everybody knows\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Then let those who do know it learn that you are able to bear such\r\nwounds without outward complaint. I tell you fairly that I cannot\r\nsympathize with a lackadaisical lover."\r\n\r\n"I know that I have made myself ridiculous to everybody. I wish I had\r\nnever come here. I wish you had never seen me."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say that, my dear boy; but take my advice for what it is\r\nworth. And remember what it is that I say; with your grief I do\r\nsympathize, but not with any outward expression of it;--not with\r\nmelancholy looks, and a sad voice, and an unhappy gait. A man should\r\nalways be able to drink his wine and seem to enjoy it. If he can\'t,\r\nhe is so much less of a man than he would be otherwise,--not so much\r\nmore, as some people seem to think. Now get yourself dressed, my dear\r\nfellow, and come down to dinner as though nothing had happened to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nAs soon as the earl was gone John looked at his watch and saw that\r\nit still wanted some forty minutes to dinner. Fifteen minutes would\r\nsuffice for him to dress, and therefore there was time sufficient\r\nfor him to seat himself in his arm-chair and think over it all.\r\nHe had for a moment been very angry when his friend had told him\r\nthat he could not sympathize with a lackadaisical lover. It was an\r\nill-natured word. He felt it to be so when he heard it, and so he\r\ncontinued to think during the whole of the half-hour that he sat in\r\nthat chair. But it probably did him more good than any word that the\r\nearl had ever spoken to him,--or any other word that he could have\r\nused. "Lackadaisical! I\'m not lackadaisical," he said to himself,\r\njumping up from his chair, and instantly sitting down again. "I\r\ndidn\'t say anything to him. I didn\'t tell him. Why did he come to\r\nme?" And yet, though he endeavoured to abuse Lord De Guest in his\r\nthoughts, he knew that Lord De Guest was right, and that he was\r\nwrong. He knew that he had been lackadaisical, and was ashamed of\r\nhimself; and at once resolved that he would henceforth demean himself\r\nas though no calamity had happened to him. "I\'ve a good mind to take\r\nhim at his word, and drink wine till I\'m drunk." Then he strove to\r\nget up his courage by a song.\r\n\r\n   If she be not fair for me,\r\n   What care I how--\r\n\r\n"But I do care. What stuff it is a man writing poetry and putting\r\ninto it such lies as that! Everybody knows that he did care,--that\r\nis, if he wasn\'t a heartless beast."\r\n\r\nBut nevertheless, when the time came for him to go down into the\r\ndrawing-room he did make the effort which his friend had counselled,\r\nand walked into the room with less of that hang-dog look than the\r\nearl and Lady Julia had expected. They were both there, as was also\r\nthe squire, and Bell followed him in less than a minute.\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t seen Crofts to-day, John, have you?" said the earl.\r\n\r\n"No; I haven\'t been anywhere his way!"\r\n\r\n"His way! His ways are every way, I take it. I wanted him to come and\r\ndine, but he seemed to think it improper to eat two dinners in the\r\nsame house two days running. Isn\'t that his theory, Miss Dale?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I don\'t know, Lord De Guest. At any rate, it isn\'t mine."\r\n\r\nSo they went to their feast, and before his last chance was over John\r\nEames found himself able to go through the pretence of enjoying his\r\nroast mutton.\r\n\r\nThere can, I think, be no doubt that in all such calamities as\r\nthat which he was now suffering, the agony of the misfortune is\r\nmuch increased by the conviction that the facts of the case are\r\nknown to those round about the sufferer. A most warm-hearted and\r\nintensely-feeling young gentleman might, no doubt, eat an excellent\r\ndinner after being refused by the girl of his devotions, provided\r\nthat he had reason to believe that none of those in whose company\r\nhe ate it knew anything of his rejection. But the same warm-hearted\r\nand intensely-feeling young gentleman would find it very difficult\r\nto go through the ceremony with any appearance of true appetite or\r\ngastronomic enjoyment, if he were aware that all his convives knew\r\nall the facts of his little misfortune. Generally, we may suppose,\r\na man in such condition goes to his club for his dinner, or seeks\r\nconsolation in the shades of some adjacent Richmond or Hampton Court.\r\nThere he meditates on his condition in silence, and does ultimately\r\nenjoy his little plate of whitebait, his cutlet and his moderate\r\npint of sherry. He probably goes alone to the theatre, and, in his\r\nstall, speculates with a somewhat bitter sarcasm on the vanity of\r\nthe world. Then he returns home, sad indeed, but with a moderated\r\nsadness, and as he puffs out the smoke of his cigar at the open\r\nwindow,--with perhaps the comfort of a little brandy-and-water at\r\nhis elbow,--swears to himself that, "By Jove, he\'ll have another\r\ntry for it." Alone, a man may console himself, or among a crowd of\r\nunconscious mortals; but it must be admitted that the position of\r\nJohn Eames was severe. He had been invited down there to woo Lily\r\nDale, and the squire and Bell had been asked to be present at the\r\nwooing. Had it all gone well, nothing could have been nicer. He would\r\nhave been the hero of the hour, and everybody would have sung for him\r\nhis song of triumph. But everything had not gone well, and he found\r\nit very difficult to carry himself otherwise than lackadaisically. On\r\nthe whole, however, his effort was such that the earl gave him credit\r\nfor his demeanour, and told him when parting with him for the night\r\nthat he was a fine fellow, and that everything should go right with\r\nhim yet.\r\n\r\n"And you mustn\'t be angry with me for speaking harshly to you," he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t a bit angry."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you were; and I rather meant that you should be. But you\r\nmustn\'t go away in dudgeon."\r\n\r\nHe stayed at the Manor House one day longer, and then he returned to\r\nhis room at the Income-tax Office, to the disagreeable sound of Sir\r\nRaffle\'s little bell, and the much more disagreeable sound of Sir\r\nRaffle\'s big voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nJOHN EAMES BECOMES A MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nEames, when he was half way up to London in the railway carriage,\r\ntook out from his pocket a letter and read it. During the former\r\nportion of his journey he had been thinking of other things; but\r\ngradually he had resolved that it would be better for him not to\r\nthink more of those other things for the present, and therefore he\r\nhad recourse to his letter by way of dissipating his thoughts. It was\r\nfrom Cradell, and ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Income-Tax Office, May --, 186--.\r\n\r\n   MY DEAR JOHN,--I hope the tidings which I have to give\r\n   you will not make you angry, and that you will not think\r\n   I am untrue to the great friendship which I have for you\r\n   because of that which I am now going to tell you. There\r\n   is no _man_--[and the word man was underscored]--there is\r\n   no _man_ whose regard I value so highly as I do yours;\r\n   and though I feel that you can have no just ground to be\r\n   displeased with me after all that I have heard you say on\r\n   many occasions, nevertheless, in matters of the heart it\r\n   is very hard for one person to understand the sentiments\r\n   of another, and when the affections of a lady are\r\n   concerned, I know that quarrels will sometimes arise.\r\n\r\n\r\nEames, when he had got so far as this, on the first perusal of the\r\nletter, knew well what was to follow. "Poor Caudle!" he said to\r\nhimself; "he\'s hooked, and he\'ll never get himself off the hook\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n\r\n   But let that be as it may, the matter has now gone too\r\n   far for any alteration to be made by me; nor would any\r\n   mere earthly inducement suffice to change me. The claims\r\n   of friendship are very strong, _but those of love are\r\n   paramount_. Of course I know all that has passed between\r\n   you and Amelia Roper. Much of this I had heard from\r\n   you before, but the rest she has now told me with that\r\n   pure-minded honesty which is the most remarkable feature\r\n   in her character. She has confessed that at one time she\r\n   felt attached to you, and that she was induced by your\r\n   perseverance to allow you to regard her as your fiancy.\r\n   [Fancy-girl he probably conceived to be the vulgar English\r\n   for the elegant term which he used.] But all that must\r\n   be over between you now. _Amelia has promised to be\r\n   mine_--[this also was underscored]--and mine I intend that\r\n   she shall be. That you may find in the kind smiles of\r\n   L. D. consolation for any disappointment which this may\r\n   occasion you, is the ardent wish of your true friend,\r\n\r\n   JOSEPH CRADELL.\r\n\r\n   P.S.--Perhaps I had better tell you the whole. Mrs. Roper\r\n   has been in some trouble about her house. She is a little\r\n   in arrears with her rent, and some bills have not been\r\n   paid. As she explained that she has been brought into this\r\n   by those dreadful Lupexes I have consented to take the\r\n   house into my own hands, and have given bills to one or\r\n   two tradesmen for small amounts. Of course she will take\r\n   them up, but it was the credit that was wanting. She\r\n   will carry on the house, but I shall, in fact, be the\r\n   proprietor. I suppose it will not suit you now to remain\r\n   here, but don\'t you think I might make it comfortable\r\n   enough for some of our fellows; say half-a-dozen, or so?\r\n   That is Mrs. Roper\'s idea, and I certainly think it is not\r\n   a bad one. Our first efforts must be to get rid of the\r\n   Lupexes. Miss Spruce goes next week. In the meantime we\r\n   are all taking our meals up in our own rooms, so that\r\n   there is nothing for the Lupexes to eat. But they don\'t\r\n   seem to mind that, and still keep the sitting-room and\r\n   best bedroom. We mean to lock them out after Tuesday, and\r\n   send all their boxes to the public-house.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor Cradell! Eames, as he threw himself back upon his seat and\r\ncontemplated the depth of misfortune into which his friend had\r\nfallen, began to be almost in love with his own position. He himself\r\nwas, no doubt, a very miserable fellow. There was only one thing\r\nin life worth living for, and that he could not get. He had been\r\nthinking for the last three days of throwing himself before a\r\nlocomotive steam-engine, and was not quite sure that he would not\r\ndo it yet; but, nevertheless, his place was a place among the gods\r\nas compared to that which poor Cradell had selected for himself.\r\nTo be not only the husband of Amelia Roper, but to have been driven\r\nto take upon himself as his bride\'s fortune the whole of his\r\nfuture mother-in-law\'s debts! To find himself the owner of a very\r\nindifferent lodging-house;--the owner as regarded all responsibility,\r\nthough not the owner as regarded any possible profit! And then, above\r\nand almost worse than all the rest, to find himself saddled with the\r\nLupexes in the beginning of his career! Poor Cradell indeed!\r\n\r\nEames had not taken his things away from the lodging-house before he\r\nleft London, and therefore determined to drive to Burton Crescent\r\nimmediately on his arrival, not with the intention of remaining\r\nthere, even for a night, but that he might bid them farewell, speak\r\nhis congratulations to Amelia, and arrange for his final settlement\r\nwith Mrs. Roper. It should have been explained in the last chapter\r\nthat the earl had told him before parting with him that his want of\r\nsuccess with Lily would make no difference as regarded money. John\r\nhad, of course, expostulated, saying that he did not want anything,\r\nand would not, under his existing circumstances, accept anything; but\r\nthe earl was a man who knew how to have his own way, and in this\r\nmatter did have it. Our friend, therefore, was a man of wealth when\r\nhe returned to London, and could tell Mrs. Roper that he would send\r\nher a cheque for her little balance as soon as he reached his office.\r\n\r\nHe arrived in the middle of the day,--not timing his return at all\r\nafter the usual manner of Government clerks, who generally manage to\r\nreach the metropolis not more than half an hour before the moment\r\nat which they are bound to show themselves in their seats. But he\r\nhad come back two days before he was due, and had run away from the\r\ncountry as though London in May to him were much pleasanter than the\r\nwoods and fields. But neither had London nor the woods and fields any\r\ninfluence on his return. He had gone down that he might throw himself\r\nat the feet of Lily Dale,--gone down, as he now confessed to himself,\r\nwith hopes almost triumphant, and he had returned because Lily Dale\r\nwould not have him at her feet. "I loved him,--him, Crosbie,--better\r\nthan all the world besides. It is still the same. I still love him\r\nbetter than all the world." Those were the words which had driven him\r\nback to London; and having been sent away with such words as those,\r\nit was little matter to him whether he reached his office a day or\r\ntwo sooner or later. The little room in the city, even with the\r\naccompaniment of Sir Raffle\'s bell and Sir Raffle\'s voice, would be\r\nnow more congenial to him than Lady Julia\'s drawing-room. He would\r\ntherefore present himself to Sir Raffle on that very afternoon, and\r\nexpel some interloper from his seat. But he would first call in\r\nBurton Crescent and say farewell to the Ropers.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened for him by the faithful Jemima. "Mr. Heames, Mr.\r\nHeames! ho dear, ho dear!" and the poor girl, who had always taken\r\nhis side in the adventures of the lodging-house, raised her hands on\r\nhigh and lamented the fate which had separated her favourite from its\r\nfortunes. "I suppose you knows it all, Mister Johnny?" Mister Johnny\r\nsaid that he believed he did know it all, and asked for the mistress\r\nof the house. "Yes, sure enough, she\'s at home. She don\'t dare stir\r\nout much, \'cause of them Lupexes. Ain\'t this a pretty game? No dinner\r\nand no nothink! Them boxes is Miss Spruce\'s. She\'s agoing now, this\r\nminute. You\'ll find \'em all upstairs in the drawen-room." So upstairs\r\ninto the drawing-room he went, and there he found the mother and\r\ndaughter, and with them Miss Spruce, tightly packed up in her bonnet\r\nand shawl. "Don\'t, mother," Amelia was saying; "what\'s the good of\r\ngoing on in that way? If she chooses to go, let her go."\r\n\r\n"But she\'s been with me now so many years," said Mrs. Roper, sobbing;\r\n"and I\'ve always done everything for her! Haven\'t I, now, Sally\r\nSpruce?" It struck Eames immediately that, though he had been an\r\ninmate in the house for two years, he had never before heard that\r\nmaiden lady\'s Christian name. Miss Spruce was the first to see Eames\r\nas he entered the room. It is probable that Mrs. Roper\'s pathos might\r\nhave produced some answering pathos on her part had she remained\r\nunobserved, but the sight of a young man brought her back to her\r\nusual state of quiescence. "I\'m only an old woman," said she; "and\r\nhere\'s Mr. Eames come back again."\r\n\r\n"How d\'ye do, Mrs. Roper? how d\'ye do,--Amelia? how d\'ye do, Miss\r\nSpruce?" and he shook hands with them all.\r\n\r\n"Oh, laws," said Mrs. Roper, "you have given me such a start!"\r\n\r\n"Dear me, Mr. Eames; only think of your coming back in that way,"\r\nsaid Amelia.\r\n\r\n"Well, what way should I come back? You didn\'t hear me knock at the\r\ndoor, that\'s all. So Miss Spruce is really going to leave you?"\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it dreadful, Mr. Eames? Nineteen years we\'ve been\r\ntogether;--taking both houses together, Miss Spruce, we have,\r\nindeed." Miss Spruce, at this point, struggled very hard to convince\r\nJohn Eames that the period in question had in truth extended over\r\nonly eighteen years, but Mrs. Roper was authoritative, and would not\r\npermit it. "It\'s nineteen years if it\'s a day. No one ought to know\r\ndates if I don\'t, and there isn\'t one in the world understands her\r\nways unless it\'s me. Haven\'t I been up to your bedroom every night,\r\nand with my own hand given you--" But she stopped herself, and was\r\ntoo good a woman to declare before a young man what had been the\r\nnature of her nightly ministrations to her guest.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you\'ll be so comfortable anywhere else, Miss Spruce,"\r\nsaid Eames.\r\n\r\n"Comfortable! of course she won\'t," said Amelia. "But if I was mother\r\nI wouldn\'t have any more words about it."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t the money I\'m thinking of, but the feeling of it," said\r\nMrs. Roper. "The house will be so lonely like. I shan\'t know myself;\r\nthat I shan\'t. And now that things are all settled so pleasantly, and\r\nthat the Lupexes must go on Tuesday-- I\'ll tell you what, Sally; I\'ll\r\npay for the cab myself, and I\'ll start off to Dulwich by the omnibus\r\nto-morrow, and settle it all out of my own pocket. I will indeed.\r\nCome; there\'s the cab. Let me go down, and send him away."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do that," said Eames. "It\'s only sixpence, off the stand,"\r\nMrs. Roper called to him as he left the room. But the cabman got\r\na shilling, and John, as he returned, found Jemima in the act of\r\ncarrying Miss Spruce\'s boxes back to her room. "So much the better\r\nfor poor Caudle," said he to himself. "As he has gone into the trade\r\nit\'s well that he should have somebody that will pay him."\r\n\r\nMrs. Roper followed Miss Spruce up the stairs and Johnny was left\r\nwith Amelia. "He\'s written to you, I know," said she, with her face\r\nturned a little away from him. She was certainly very handsome, but\r\nthere was a hard, cross, almost sullen look about her, which robbed\r\nher countenance of all its pleasantness. And yet she had no intention\r\nof being sullen with him.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said John. "He has told me how it\'s all going to be."\r\n\r\n"Well?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Well?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Is that all you\'ve got to say?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll congratulate you, if you\'ll let me."\r\n\r\n"Psha;--congratulations! I hate such humbug. If you\'ve no feelings\r\nabout it, I\'m sure that I\'ve none. Indeed I don\'t know what\'s the\r\ngood of feelings. They never did me any good. Are you engaged to\r\nmarry L. D.?"\r\n\r\n"No, I am not."\r\n\r\n"And you\'ve nothing else to say to me?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing,--except my hopes for your happiness. What else can I say?\r\nYou are engaged to marry my friend Cradell, and I think it will be a\r\nhappy match."\r\n\r\nShe turned away her face further from him, and the look of it became\r\neven more sullen. Could it be possible that at such a moment she\r\nstill had a hope that he might come back to her?\r\n\r\n"Good-by, Amelia," he said, putting out his hand to her.\r\n\r\n"And this is to be the last of you in this house!"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know about that. I\'ll come and call upon you, if\r\nyou\'ll let me, when you\'re married."\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, "that there may be rows in the house, and noise, and\r\njealousy,--as there have been with that wicked woman upstairs. Not\r\nif I know it, you won\'t! John Eames, I wish I\'d never seen you. I\r\nwish we might have both fallen dead when we first met. I didn\'t think\r\never to have cared for a man as I have cared for you. It\'s all trash\r\nand nonsense and foolery; I know that. It\'s all very well for young\r\nladies as can sit in drawing-rooms all their lives, but when a woman\r\nhas her way to make in the world it\'s all foolery. And such a hard\r\nway too to make as mine is!"\r\n\r\n"But it won\'t be hard now."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t it? But I think it will. I wish you would try it. Not that I\'m\r\ngoing to complain. I never minded work, and as for company, I can put\r\nup with anybody. The world\'s not to be all dancing and fiddling for\r\nthe likes of me. I know that well enough. But--" and then she paused.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the \'but\' about, Amelia?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s like you to ask me; isn\'t it?" To tell the truth he should not\r\nhave asked her. "Never mind. I\'m not going to have any words with\r\nyou. If you\'ve been a knave I\'ve been a fool, and that\'s worse."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t think I have been a knave."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been both," said the girl; "and both for nothing. After that\r\nyou may go. I\'ve told you what I am, and I\'ll leave you to name\r\nyourself. I didn\'t think it was in me to have been such a fool. It\'s\r\nthat that frets me. Never mind, sir; it\'s all over now, and I wish\r\nyou good-by."\r\n\r\nI do not think that there was the slightest reason why John should\r\nhave again kissed her at parting, but he did so. She bore it, not\r\nstruggling with him; but she took his caress with sullen endurance.\r\n"It\'ll be the last," she said. "Good-by, John Eames."\r\n\r\n"Good-by, Amelia. Try to make him a good wife and then you\'ll\r\nbe happy." She turned up her nose at this, assuming a look of\r\nunutterable scorn. But she said nothing further, and then he left\r\nthe room. At the parlour door he met Mrs. Roper, and had his parting\r\nwords with her.\r\n\r\n"I am so glad you came," said she. "It was just that word you said\r\nthat made Miss Spruce stay. Her money is so ready, you know! And\r\nso you\'ve had it all out with her about Cradell. She\'ll make him a\r\ngood wife, she will indeed;--much better than you\'ve been giving her\r\ncredit for."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t doubt she\'ll be a very good wife."\r\n\r\n"You see, Mr. Eames, it\'s all over now, and we understand each other;\r\ndon\'t we? It made me very unhappy when she was setting her cap at\r\nyou; it did indeed. She is my own daughter, and I couldn\'t go against\r\nher;--could I? But I knew it wasn\'t in any way suiting. Laws, I know\r\nthe difference. She\'s good enough for him any day of the week, Mr.\r\nEames."\r\n\r\n"That she is,--Saturdays or Sundays," said Johnny, not knowing\r\nexactly what he ought to say.\r\n\r\n"So she is; and if he does his duty by her she won\'t go astray in\r\nhers by him. And as for you, Mr. Eames, I am sure I\'ve always felt it\r\nan honour and a pleasure to have you in the house; and if ever you\r\ncould use a good word in sending to me any of your young men, I\'d do\r\nby them as a mother should; I would indeed. I know I\'ve been to blame\r\nabout those Lupexes, but haven\'t I suffered for it, Mr. Eames? And it\r\nwas difficult to know at first; wasn\'t it? And as to you and Amelia,\r\nif you would send any of your young men to try, there couldn\'t be\r\nanything more of that kind, could there? I know it hasn\'t all been\r\njust as it should have been;--that is as regards you; but I should\r\nlike to hear you say that you\'ve found me honest before you went. I\r\nhave tried to be honest, I have indeed."\r\n\r\nEames assured her that he was convinced of her honesty, and that\r\nhe had never thought of impugning her character either in regard\r\nto those unfortunate people, the Lupexes, or in reference to other\r\nmatters. "He did not think," he said, "that any young men would\r\nconsult him as to their lodgings; but if he could be of any service\r\nto her, he would." Then he bade her good-by, and having bestowed\r\nhalf-a-sovereign on the faithful Jemima, he took a long farewell of\r\nBurton Crescent. Amelia had told him not to come and see her when she\r\nshould be married, and he had resolved that he would take her at her\r\nword. So he walked off from the Crescent, not exactly shaking the\r\ndust from his feet, but resolving that he would know no more either\r\nof its dust or of its dirt. Dirt enough he had encountered there\r\ncertainly, and he was now old enough to feel that the inmates of Mrs.\r\nRoper\'s house had not been those among whom a resting-place for his\r\nearly years should judiciously have been sought. But he had come out\r\nof the fire comparatively unharmed, and I regret to say that he felt\r\nbut little for the terrible scorchings to which his friend had been\r\nsubjected and was about to subject himself. He was quite content to\r\nlook at the matter exactly as it was looked at by Mrs. Roper. Amelia\r\nwas good enough for Joseph Cradell--any day of the week. Poor\r\nCradell, of whom in these pages after this notice no more will be\r\nheard! I cannot but think that a hard measure of justice was meted\r\nout to him, in proportion to the extent of his sins. More weak and\r\nfoolish than our friend and hero he had been, but not to my knowledge\r\nmore wicked. But it is to the vain and foolish that the punishments\r\nfall;--and to them they fall so thickly and constantly that the\r\nthinker is driven to think that vanity and folly are of all sins\r\nthose which may be the least forgiven. As for Cradell I may declare\r\nthat he did marry Amelia, that he did, with some pride, take the\r\nplace of master of the house at the bottom of Mrs. Roper\'s table, and\r\nthat he did make himself responsible for all Mrs. Roper\'s debts. Of\r\nhis future fortunes there is not space to speak in these pages.\r\n\r\nGoing away from the Crescent Eames had himself driven to his office,\r\nwhich he reached just as the men were leaving it, at four o\'clock.\r\nCradell was gone, so that he did not see him on that afternoon; but\r\nhe had an opportunity of shaking hands with Mr. Love, who treated\r\nhim with all the smiling courtesy due to an official bigwig,--for\r\na private secretary, if not absolutely a big-wig, is semi-big, and\r\nentitled to a certain amount of reverence;--and he passed Mr. Kissing\r\nin the passage, hurrying along as usual with a huge book under\r\nhis arm. Mr. Kissing, hurried as he was, stopped his shuffling\r\nfeet; but Eames only looked at him, hardly honouring him with the\r\nacknowledgment of a nod of his head. Mr. Kissing, however, was\r\nnot offended; he knew that the private secretary of the First\r\nCommissioner had been the guest of an earl; and what more than a nod\r\ncould be expected from him? After that John made his way into the\r\naugust presence of Sir Raffle, and found that great man putting on\r\nhis shoes in the presence of FitzHoward. FitzHoward blushed; but the\r\nshoes had not been touched by him, as he took occasion afterwards to\r\ninform John Eames.\r\n\r\nSir Raffle was all smiles and civility. "Delighted to see you\r\nback, Eames: am, upon my word; though I and FitzHoward have got on\r\ncapitally in your absence; haven\'t we, FitzHoward?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," drawled FitzHoward. "I haven\'t minded it for a time, just\r\nwhile Eames has been away."\r\n\r\n"You\'re much too idle to keep at it, I know; but your bread will be\r\nbuttered for you elsewhere, so it doesn\'t signify. My compliments to\r\nthe duchess when you see her." Then FitzHoward went. "And how\'s my\r\ndear old friend?" asked Sir Raffle, as though of all men living Lord\r\nDe Guest were the one for whom he had the strongest and the oldest\r\nlove. And yet he must have known that John Eames knew as much about\r\nit as he did himself. But there are men who have the most lively\r\ngratification in calling lords and marquises their friends, though\r\nthey know that nobody believes a word of what they say,--even though\r\nthey know how great is the odium they incur, and how lasting is the\r\nridicule which their vanity produces. It is a gentle insanity which\r\nprevails in the outer courts of every aristocracy; and as it brings\r\nwith itself considerable annoyance and but a lukewarm pleasure, it\r\nshould not be treated with too keen a severity.\r\n\r\n"And how\'s my dear old friend?" Eames assured him that his dear old\r\nfriend was all right, that Lady Julia was all right, that the dear\r\nold place was all right. Sir Raffle now spoke as though the "dear\r\nold place" were quite well known to him. "Was the game doing pretty\r\nwell? Was there a promise of birds?" Sir Raffle\'s anxiety was\r\nquite intense, and expressed with almost familiar affection. "And,\r\nby-the-by, Eames, where are you living at present?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m not settled. I\'m at the Great Western Railway Hotel at\r\nthis moment."\r\n\r\n"Capital house, very; only it\'s expensive if you stay there the whole\r\nseason." Johnny had no idea of remaining there beyond one night, but\r\nhe said nothing as to this. "By-the-by, you might as well come and\r\ndine with us to-morrow. Lady Buffle is most anxious to know you.\r\nThere\'ll be one or two with us. I did ask my friend Dumbello, but\r\nthere\'s some nonsense going on in the House, and he thinks that he\r\ncan\'t get away." Johnny was more gracious than Lord Dumbello, and\r\naccepted the invitation. "I wonder what Lady Buffle will be like?" he\r\nsaid to himself, as he walked away from the office.\r\n\r\nHe had turned into the Great Western Hotel, not as yet knowing where\r\nto look for a home; and there we will leave him, eating his solitary\r\nmutton-chop at one of those tables which are so comfortable to the\r\neye, but which are so comfortless in reality. I speak not now with\r\nreference to the excellent establishment which has been named, but\r\nto the nature of such tables in general. A solitary mutton-chop in\r\nan hotel coffee-room is not a banquet to be envied by any god; and\r\nif the mutton-chop be converted into soup, fish, little dishes,\r\nbig dishes, and the rest, the matter becomes worse and not better.\r\nWhat comfort are you to have, seated alone on that horsehair chair,\r\nstaring into the room and watching the waiters as they whisk about\r\ntheir towels? No one but an Englishman has ever yet thought of\r\nsubjecting himself to such a position as that! But here we will leave\r\nJohn Eames, and in doing so I must be allowed to declare that only\r\nnow, at this moment, has he entered on his manhood. Hitherto he\r\nhas been a hobbledehoy,--a calf, as it were, who had carried his\r\ncalfishness later into life than is common with calves; but who did\r\nnot, perhaps, on that account, give promise of making a worse ox than\r\nthe rest of them. His life hitherto, as recorded in these pages, had\r\nafforded him no brilliant success, had hardly qualified him for the\r\nrole of hero which he has been made to play. I feel that I have been\r\nin fault in giving such prominence to a hobbledehoy, and that I\r\nshould have told my story better had I brought Mr. Crosbie more\r\nconspicuously forward on my canvas. He at any rate has gotten to\r\nhimself a wife--as a hero always should do; whereas I must leave my\r\npoor friend Johnny without any matrimonial prospects.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that he thought of himself as he sat moping over his\r\nsolitary table in the hotel coffee-room. He acknowledged to himself\r\nthat he had not hitherto been a man; but at the same time he made\r\nsome resolution which, I trust, may assist him in commencing his\r\nmanhood from this date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was early in June that Lily went up to her uncle at the Great\r\nHouse, pleading for Hopkins,--pleading that to Hopkins might be\r\nrestored all the privileges of head gardener at the Great House.\r\nThere was some absurdity in this, seeing that he had never really\r\nrelinquished his privileges; but the manner of the quarrel had been\r\nin this wise.\r\n\r\nThere was in those days, and had been for years, a vexed question\r\nbetween Hopkins and Jolliffe the bailiff on the matter of--stable\r\nmanure. Hopkins had pretended to the right of taking what he required\r\nfrom the farmyard, without asking leave of any one. Jolliffe in\r\nreturn had hinted, that if this were so, Hopkins would take it all.\r\n"But I can\'t eat it," Hopkins had said. Jolliffe merely grunted,\r\nsignifying by the grunt, as Hopkins thought, that though a gardener\r\ncouldn\'t eat a mountain of manure fifty feet long and fifteen\r\nhigh--couldn\'t eat in the body,--he might convert it into things\r\nedible for his own personal use. And so there had been a great feud.\r\nThe unfortunate squire had of course been called on to arbitrate, and\r\nhaving postponed his decision by every contrivance possible to him,\r\nhad at last been driven by Jolliffe to declare that Hopkins should\r\ntake nothing that was not assigned to him. Hopkins, when the decision\r\nwas made known to him by his master, bit his old lips, and turned\r\nround upon his old heel, speechless. "You\'ll find it\'s so at all\r\nother places," said the squire, apologetically. "Other places!"\r\nsneered Hopkins. Where would he find other gardeners like himself?\r\nIt is hardly necessary to declare that from that moment he resolved\r\nthat he would abide by no such order. Jolliffe on the next morning\r\ninformed the squire that the order had been broken, and the squire\r\nfretted and fumed, wishing that Jolliffe were well buried under the\r\nmountain in question. "If they all is to do as they like," said\r\nJolliffe, "then nobody won\'t care for nobody." The squire understood\r\nthat an order if given must be obeyed, and therefore, with many inner\r\ngroanings of the spirit, resolved that war must be waged against\r\nHopkins.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning he found the old man himself wheeling a huge\r\nbarrow of manure round from the yard into the kitchen-garden. Now, on\r\nordinary occasions, Hopkins was not required to do with his own hands\r\nwork of that description. He had a man under him who hewed wood, and\r\ncarried water, and wheeled barrows,--one man always, and often two.\r\nThe squire knew when he saw him that he was sinning, and bade him\r\nstop upon his road.\r\n\r\n"Hopkins," he said, "why didn\'t you ask for what you wanted, before\r\nyou took it?" The old man put down the barrow on the ground, looked\r\nup in his master\'s face, spat into his hands, and then again resumed\r\nhis barrow. "Hopkins, that won\'t do," said the squire. "Stop where\r\nyou are."\r\n\r\n"What won\'t do?" said Hopkins, still holding the barrow from the\r\nground, but not as yet progressing.\r\n\r\n"Put it down, Hopkins," and Hopkins did put it down. "Don\'t you know\r\nthat you are flatly disobeying my orders?"\r\n\r\n"Squire, I\'ve been here about this place going on nigh seventy\r\nyears."\r\n\r\n"If you\'ve been going on a hundred and seventy it wouldn\'t do that\r\nthere should be more than one master. I\'m the master here, and I\r\nintend to be so to the end. Take that manure back into the yard."\r\n\r\n"Back into the yard?" said Hopkins, very slowly.\r\n\r\n"Yes; back into the yard."\r\n\r\n"What,--afore all their faces?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; you\'ve disobeyed me before all their faces?"\r\n\r\nHopkins paused a moment, looking away from the squire, and shaking\r\nhis head as though he had need of deep thought, but by the aid of\r\ndeep thought had come at last to a right conclusion. Then he resumed\r\nthe barrow, and putting himself almost into a trot, carried away his\r\nprize into the kitchen-garden. At the pace which he went it would\r\nhave been beyond the squire\'s power to stop him, nor would Mr. Dale\r\nhave wished to come to a personal encounter with his servant. But he\r\ncalled after the man in dire wrath that if he were not obeyed the\r\ndisobedient servant should rue the consequences for ever. Hopkins,\r\nequal to the occasion, shook his head as he trotted on, deposited his\r\nload at the foot of the cucumber-frames, and then at once returning\r\nto his master, tendered to him the key of the greenhouse.\r\n\r\n"Master," said Hopkins, speaking as best he could with his scanty\r\nbreath, "there it is;--there\'s the key; of course I don\'t want no\r\nwarning, and doesn\'t care about my week\'s wages. I\'ll be out of the\r\ncottage afore night, and as for the work\'us, I suppose they\'ll let me\r\nin at once, if your honour\'ll give \'em a line."\r\n\r\nNow as Hopkins was well known by the squire to be the owner of three\r\nor four hundred pounds, the hint about the workhouse must be allowed\r\nto have been melodramatic.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a fool," said the squire, almost gnashing his teeth.\r\n\r\n"I know I\'ve been a fool," said Hopkins, "about that \'ere doong; my\r\nfeelings has been too much for me. When a man\'s feelings has been\r\ntoo much for him, he\'d better just take hisself off, and lie in the\r\nwork\'us till he dies." And then he again tendered the key. But the\r\nsquire did not take the key, and so Hopkins went on. "I s\'pose I\'d\r\nbetter just see to the lights and the like of that, till you\'ve\r\nsuited yourself, Mr. Dale. It \'ud be a pity all them grapes should go\r\noff, and they, as you may say, all one as fit for the table. It\'s a\r\nlong way the best crop I ever see on \'em. I\'ve been that careful with\r\n\'em that I haven\'t had a natural night\'s rest, not since February.\r\nThere ain\'t nobody about this place as understands grapes, nor yet\r\nanywhere nigh that could be got at. My lord\'s head man is wery\r\nignorant; but even if he knew ever so, of course he couldn\'t come\r\nhere. I suppose I\'d better keep the key till you\'re suited, Mr.\r\nDale."\r\n\r\nThen for a fortnight there was an interregnum in the gardens,\r\nterrible in the annals of Allington. Hopkins lived in his cottage\r\nindeed, and looked most sedulously after the grapes. In looking after\r\nthe grapes, too, he took the greenhouses under his care; but he\r\nwould have nothing to do with the outer gardens, took no wages,\r\nreturning the amount sent to him back to the squire, and insisted\r\nwith everybody that he had been dismissed. He went about with some\r\nterrible horticultural implement always in his hand, with which it\r\nwas said that he intended to attack Jolliffe; but Jolliffe prudently\r\nkept out of his way.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it had been resolved by Mrs. Dale and Lily that\r\nthe flitting from the Small House at Allington was not to be\r\naccomplished, Lily communicated the fact to Hopkins.\r\n\r\n"Miss," said he, "when I said them few words to you and your mamma,\r\nI knew that you would listen to reason."\r\n\r\nThis was no more than Lily had expected; that Hopkins should claim\r\nthe honour of having prevailed by his arguments was a matter of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lily; "we\'ve made up our minds to stay. Uncle wishes it."\r\n\r\n"Wishes it! Laws, miss; it ain\'t only wishes. And we all wishes it.\r\nWhy, now, look at the reason of the thing. Here\'s this here house--"\r\n\r\n"But, Hopkins, it\'s decided. We\'re going to stay. What I want to know\r\nis this; can you come at once and help me to unpack?"\r\n\r\n"What! this very evening, as is--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, now; we want to have the things about again before they come\r\nback from Guestwick."\r\n\r\nHopkins scratched his head and hesitated, not wishing to yield to any\r\nproposition that could be considered as childish; but he gave way at\r\nlast, feeling that the work itself was a good work. Mrs. Dale also\r\nassented, laughing at Lily for her folly as she did so, and in this\r\nway the things were unpacked very quickly, and the alliance between\r\nLily and Hopkins became, for the time, very close. This work of\r\nunpacking and resettling was not yet over, when the battle of the\r\nmanure broke out, and therefore it was that Hopkins, when his\r\nfeelings had become altogether too much for him "about the doong,"\r\ncame at last to Lily, and laying down at her feet all the weight\r\nand all the glory of his sixty odd years of life, implored her to\r\nmake matters straight for him. "It\'s been a killing me, miss, so\r\nit has; to see the way they\'ve been a cutting that \'sparagus. It\r\nain\'t cutting at all. It\'s just hocking it up;--what is fit, and\r\nwhat isn\'t, all together. And they\'ve been a-putting the plants in\r\nwhere I didn\'t mean \'em, though they know\'d I didn\'t mean \'em. I\'ve\r\nstood by, miss, and said never a word. I\'d a died sooner. But, Miss\r\nLily, what my sufferings have been, \'cause of my feelings getting\r\nthe better of me about that--you know, miss--nobody will ever\r\ntell;--nobody--nobody--nobody." Then Hopkins turned away and wept.\r\n\r\n"Uncle," said Lily, creeping close up against his chair, "I want to\r\nask you a great favour."\r\n\r\n"A great favour. Well, I don\'t think I shall refuse you anything at\r\npresent. It isn\'t to ask another earl to the house,--is it?"\r\n\r\n"Another earl!" said Lily.\r\n\r\n"Yes; haven\'t you heard? Miss Bell has been here this morning,\r\ninsisting that I should have over Lord De Guest and his sister for\r\nthe marriage. It seems that there was some scheming between Bell and\r\nLady Julia."\r\n\r\n"Of course you\'ll ask them."\r\n\r\n"Of course I must. I\'ve no way out of it. It\'ll be all very well for\r\nBell, who\'ll be off to Wales with her lover; but what am I to do with\r\nthe earl and Lady Julia, when they\'re gone? Will you come and help\r\nme?"\r\n\r\nIn answer to this, Lily of course promised that she would come and\r\nhelp. "Indeed," said she, "I thought we were all asked up for the\r\nday. And now for my favour. Uncle, you must forgive poor Hopkins."\r\n\r\n"Forgive a fiddlestick!" said the squire.\r\n\r\n"No, but you must. You can\'t think how unhappy he is."\r\n\r\n"How can I forgive a man who won\'t forgive me. He goes prowling about\r\nthe place doing nothing; and he sends me back his wages, and he\r\nlooks as though he were going to murder some one; and all because he\r\nwouldn\'t do as he was told. How am I to forgive such a man as that?"\r\n\r\n"But, uncle, why not?"\r\n\r\n"It would be his forgiving me. He knows very well that he may come\r\nback whenever he pleases; and, indeed, for the matter of that he has\r\nnever gone away."\r\n\r\n"But he is so very unhappy."\r\n\r\n"What can I do to make him happier?"\r\n\r\n"Just go down to his cottage and tell him that you forgive him."\r\n\r\n"Then he\'ll argue with me."\r\n\r\n"No; I don\'t think he will. He is too much down in the world for\r\narguing now."\r\n\r\n"Ah! you don\'t know him as I do. All the misfortunes in the world\r\nwouldn\'t stop that man\'s conceit. Of course I\'ll go if you ask me,\r\nbut it seems to me that I\'m made to knock under to everybody. I hear\r\na great deal about other people\'s feelings, but I don\'t know that\r\nmine are very much thought of." He was not altogether in a happy\r\nmood, and Lily almost regretted that she had persevered; but she did\r\nsucceed in carrying him off across the garden to the cottage, and\r\nas they went together she promised him that she would think of him\r\nalways,--always. The scene with Hopkins cannot be described now, as\r\nit would take too many of our few remaining pages. It resulted, I am\r\nafraid I must confess, in nothing more triumphant to the squire than\r\na treaty of mutual forgiveness. Hopkins acknowledged, with much\r\nself-reproach, that his feelings had been too many for him; but then,\r\nlook at his provocation! He could not keep his tongue from that\r\nmatter, and certainly said as much in his own defence as he did in\r\nconfession of his sins. The substantial triumph was altogether his,\r\nfor nobody again ever dared to interfere with his operations in the\r\nfarmyard. He showed his submission to his master mainly by consenting\r\nto receive his wages for the two weeks which he had passed in\r\nidleness.\r\n\r\nOwing to this little accident, Lily was not so much oppressed by\r\nHopkins as she had expected to be in that matter of their altered\r\nplans; but this salvation did not extend to Mrs. Hearn, to Mrs.\r\nCrump, or, above all, to Mrs. Boyce. They, all of them, took an\r\ninterest more or less strong in the Hopkins controversy; but their\r\ninterest in the occupation of the Small House was much stronger,\r\nand it was found useless to put Mrs. Hearn off with the gardener\'s\r\npersistent refusal of his wages, when she was big with inquiry\r\nwhether the house was to be painted inside, as well as out. "Ah,"\r\nsaid she, "I think I\'ll go and look at lodgings at Guestwick myself,\r\nand pack up some of my beds." Lily made no answer to this, feeling\r\nthat it was a part of that punishment which she had expected. "Dear,\r\ndear," said Mrs. Crump to the two girls; "well, to be sure, we should\r\n\'a been \'lone without \'ee, and mayhap we might \'a got worse in your\r\nplace; but why did \'ee go and fasten up all your things in them big\r\nboxes, just to unfasten \'em all again?"\r\n\r\n"We changed our minds, Mrs. Crump," said Bell, with some severity.\r\n\r\n"Yees, I know ye changed your mindses. Well, it\'s all right for loiks\r\no\' ye, no doubt; but if we changes our mindses, we hears of it."\r\n\r\n"So, it seems, do we!" said Lily. "But never mind, Mrs. Crump. Do you\r\nsend us our letters up early, and then we won\'t quarrel."\r\n\r\n"Oh, letters! Drat them for letters. I wish there weren\'t no sich\r\nthings. There was a man here yesterday with his imperence. I don\'t\r\nknow where he come from,--down from Lun\'on, I b\'leeve: and this was\r\nwrong, and that was wrong, and everything was wrong; and then he said\r\nhe\'d have me discharged the sarvice."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, Mrs. Crump; that wouldn\'t do at all."\r\n\r\n"Discharged the sarvice! Tuppence farden a day. So I told \'un to\r\ndischarge hisself, and take all the old bundles and things away\r\nupon his shoulders. Letters indeed! What business have they with\r\npost-missusses, if they cannot pay \'em better nor tuppence farden\r\na day?" And in this way, under the shelter of Mrs. Crump\'s storm\r\nof wrath against the inspector who had visited her, Lily and Bell\r\nescaped much that would have fallen upon their own heads; but Mrs.\r\nBoyce still remained. I may here add, in order that Mrs. Crump\'s\r\nhistory may be carried on to the farthest possible point, that she\r\nwas not "discharged the sarvice," and that she still receives her\r\ntwopence farthing a day from the Crown. "That\'s a bitter old lady,"\r\nsaid the inspector to the man who was driving him. "Yes, sir; they\r\nall says the same about she. There ain\'t none of \'em get much change\r\nout of Mrs. Crump."\r\n\r\nBell and Lily went together also to Mrs. Boyce\'s. "If she makes\r\nherself very disagreeable, I shall insist upon talking of your\r\nmarriage," said Lily.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve not the slightest objection," said Bell; "only I don\'t know\r\nwhat there can be to say about it. Marrying the doctor is such a very\r\ncommonplace sort of thing."\r\n\r\n"Not a bit more commonplace than marrying the parson," said Lily.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, it is. Parsons\' marriages are often very grand affairs.\r\nThey come in among county people. That\'s their luck in life. Doctors\r\nnever do; nor lawyers. I don\'t think lawyers ever get married in\r\nthe country. They\'re supposed to do it up in London. But a country\r\ndoctor\'s wedding is not a thing to be talked about much."\r\n\r\nMrs. Boyce probably agreed in this view of the matter, seeing that\r\nshe did not choose the coming marriage as her first subject of\r\nconversation. As soon as the two girls were seated she flew away\r\nimmediately to the house, and began to express her very great\r\nsurprise,--her surprise and her joy also,--at the sudden change which\r\nhad been made in their plans. "It is so much nicer, you know," said\r\nshe, "that things should be pleasant among relatives."\r\n\r\n"Things always have been tolerably pleasant with us," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I\'m sure of that. I\'ve always said it was quite a pleasure\r\nto see you and your uncle together. And when we heard about your all\r\nhaving to leave--"\r\n\r\n"But we didn\'t have to leave, Mrs. Boyce. We were going to leave\r\nbecause we thought mamma would be more comfortable in Guestwick;\r\nand now we\'re not going to leave, because we\'ve all \'changed our\r\nmindses,\' as Mrs. Crump calls it."\r\n\r\n"And is it true the house is going to be painted?" asked Mrs. Boyce.\r\n\r\n"I believe it is true," said Lily.\r\n\r\n"Inside and out?"\r\n\r\n"It must be done some day," said Bell.\r\n\r\n"Yes, to be sure; but I must say it is generous of the squire.\r\nThere\'s such a deal of wood-work about your house. I know I wish the\r\nEcclesiastical Commissioners would paint ours; but nobody ever does\r\nanything for the clergy. I\'m sure I\'m delighted you\'re going to stay.\r\nAs I said to Mr. Boyce, what should we ever have done without you?\r\nI believe the squire had made up his mind that he would not let the\r\nplace."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he ever has let it."\r\n\r\n"And if there was nobody in it, it would all go to rack and ruin;\r\nwouldn\'t it? Had your mamma to pay anything for the lodgings she\r\nengaged at Guestwick?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, I don\'t know. Bell can tell you better about that\r\nthan I, as Dr. Crofts settled it. I suppose Dr. Crofts tells her\r\neverything." And so the conversation was changed, and Mrs. Boyce was\r\nmade to understand that whatever further mystery there might be, it\r\nwould not be unravelled on that occasion.\r\n\r\nIt was settled that Dr. Crofts and Bell should be married about the\r\nmiddle of June, and the squire determined to give what grace he could\r\nto the ceremony by opening his own house on the occasion. Lord De\r\nGuest and Lady Julia were invited by special arrangement between her\r\nladyship and Bell, as has been before explained. The colonel also\r\nwith Lady Fanny came up from Torquay on the occasion, this being the\r\nfirst visit made by the colonel to his paternal roof for many years.\r\nBernard did not accompany his father. He had not yet gone abroad, but\r\nthere were circumstances which made him feel that he would not find\r\nhimself comfortable at the wedding. The service was performed by\r\nMr. Boyce, assisted, as the _County Chronicle_ very fully remarked,\r\nby the Reverend John Joseph Jones, M.A., late of Jesus College,\r\nCambridge, and curate of St. Peter\'s, Northgate, Guestwick; the\r\nfault of which little advertisement was this,--that as none of the\r\nreaders of the paper had patience to get beyond the Reverend John\r\nJoseph Jones, the fact of Bell\'s marriage with Dr. Crofts was not\r\ndisseminated as widely as might have been wished.\r\n\r\nThe marriage went off very nicely. The squire was upon his very best\r\nbehaviour, and welcomed his guests as though he really enjoyed their\r\npresence there in his halls. Hopkins, who was quite aware that he had\r\nbeen triumphant, decorated the old rooms with mingled flowers and\r\ngreenery with an assiduous care which pleased the two girls mightily.\r\nAnd during this work of wreathing and decking there was one little\r\nmorsel of feeling displayed which may as well be told in these last\r\nlines. Lily had been encouraging the old man while Bell for a moment\r\nhad been absent.\r\n\r\n"I wish it had been for thee, my darling!" he said; "I wish it had\r\nbeen for thee!"\r\n\r\n"It is much better as it is, Hopkins," she answered, solemnly.\r\n\r\n"Not with him, though," he went on, "not with him. I wouldn\'t \'a hung\r\na bough for him. But with t\'other one."\r\n\r\nLily said no word further. She knew that the man was expressing the\r\nwishes of all around her. She said no word further, and then Bell\r\nreturned to them.\r\n\r\nBut no one at the wedding was so gay as Lily,--so gay, so bright,\r\nand so wedding-like. She flirted with the old earl till he declared\r\nthat he would marry her himself. No one seeing her that evening, and\r\nknowing nothing of her immediate history, would have imagined that\r\nshe herself had been cruelly jilted some six or eight months ago. And\r\nthose who did know her could not imagine that what she then suffered\r\nhad hit her so hard, that no recovery seemed possible for her.\r\nBut though no recovery, as she herself believed, was possible for\r\nher--though she was as a man whose right arm had been taken from him\r\nin the battle, still all the world had not gone with that right arm.\r\nThe bullet which had maimed her sorely had not touched her life, and\r\nshe scorned to go about the world complaining either by word or look\r\nof the injury she had received. "Wives when they have lost their\r\nhusbands still eat and laugh," she said to herself, "and he is not\r\ndead like that." So she resolved that she would be happy, and I here\r\ndeclare that she not only seemed to carry out her resolution, but\r\nthat she did carry it out in very truth. "You\'re a dear good man,\r\nand I know you\'ll be good to her," she said to Crofts just as he was\r\nabout to start with his bride.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try, at any rate," he answered.\r\n\r\n"And I shall expect you to be good to me too. Remember you have\r\nmarried the whole family; and, sir, you mustn\'t believe a word of\r\nwhat that bad man says in his novels about mothers-in-law. He has\r\ndone a great deal of harm, and shut half the ladies in England out of\r\ntheir daughters\' houses."\r\n\r\n"He shan\'t shut Mrs. Dale out of mine."\r\n\r\n"Remember he doesn\'t. Now, good-by." So the bride and bridegroom went\r\noff, and Lily was left to flirt with Lord De Guest.\r\n\r\nOf whom else is it necessary that a word or two should be said before\r\nI allow the weary pen to fall from my hand? The squire, after much\r\ninward struggling on the subject, had acknowledged to himself that\r\nhis sister-in-law had not received from him that kindness which she\r\nhad deserved. He had acknowledged this, purporting to do his best to\r\namend his past errors; and I think I may say that his efforts in that\r\nline would not be received ungraciously by Mrs. Dale. I am inclined\r\ntherefore to think that life at Allington, both at the Great House\r\nand at the Small, would soon become pleasanter than it used to be in\r\nformer days. Lily soon got the Balmoral boots, or, at least, soon\r\nlearned that the power of getting them as she pleased had devolved\r\nupon her from her uncle\'s gift; so that she talked even of buying the\r\nsquirrel\'s cage; but I am not aware that her extravagance led her as\r\nfar as that.\r\n\r\nLord De Courcy we left suffering dreadfully from gout and ill-temper\r\nat Courcy Castle. Yes, indeed! To him in his latter days life did\r\nnot seem to offer much that was comfortable. His wife had now gone\r\nfrom him, and declared positively to her son-in-law that no earthly\r\nconsideration should ever induce her to go back again;--"not if I\r\nwere to starve!" she said. By which she intended to signify that\r\nshe would be firm in her resolve, even though she should thereby\r\nlose her carriage and horses. Poor Mr. Gazebee went down to Courcy,\r\nand had a dreadful interview with the earl; but matters were at\r\nlast arranged, and her ladyship remained at Baden-Baden in a state\r\nof semi-starvation. That is to say, she had but one horse to her\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nAs regards Crosbie, I am inclined to believe that he did again\r\nrecover his power at his office. He was Mr. Butterwell\'s master, and\r\nthe master also of Mr. Optimist, and the major. He knew his business,\r\nand could do it, which was more, perhaps, than might fairly be said\r\nof any of the other three. Under such circumstances he was sure to\r\nget in his hand, and lead again. But elsewhere his star did not\r\nrecover its ascendancy. He dined at his club almost daily, and there\r\nwere those with whom he habitually formed some little circle. But he\r\nwas not the Crosbie of former days,--the Crosbie known in Belgravia\r\nand in St. James\'s Street. He had taken his little vessel bravely out\r\ninto the deep waters, and had sailed her well while fortune stuck\r\nclose to him. But he had forgotten his nautical rules, and success\r\nhad made him idle. His plummet and lead had not been used, and he had\r\nkept no look-out ahead. Therefore the first rock he met shivered his\r\nbark to pieces. His wife, the Lady Alexandrina, is to be seen in the\r\none-horse carriage with her mother at Baden-Baden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SMALL HOUSE AT ALLINGTON***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 4599.txt or 4599.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/4/5/9/4599\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
