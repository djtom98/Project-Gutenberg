For, on psychological investigation, the dream proves to be\r\nthe first link in a chain of abnormal psychic structures whose other\r\nlinks, the hysterical phobia, the obsession, and the delusion must, for\r\npractical reasons, claim the interest of the physician. The dream (as\r\nwill appear) can lay no claim to a corresponding practical significance;\r\nits theoretical value as a paradigm is, however, all the greater, and\r\none who cannot explain the origin of the dream pictures will strive in\r\nvain to understand the phobias, obsessive and delusional ideas, and\r\nlikewise their therapeutic importance.\r\n\r\nBut this relation, to which our subject owes its importance, is\r\nresponsible also for the deficiencies in the work before us. The\r\nsurfaces of fracture which will be found so frequently in this\r\ndiscussion correspond to so many points of contact at which the problem\r\nof the dream formation touches more comprehensive problems of\r\npsychopathology, which cannot be discussed here, and which will be\r\nsubjected to future elaboration if there should be sufficient time and\r\nenergy, and if further material should be forthcoming.\r\n\r\nPeculiarities in the material I have used to elucidate the\r\ninterpretation of dreams have rendered this publication difficult. From\r\nthe work itself it will appear why all dreams related in the literature\r\nor collected by others had to remain useless for my purpose; for\r\nexamples I had to choose between my own dreams and those of my patients\r\nwho were under psychoanalytic treatment. I was restrained from utilising\r\nthe latter material by the fact that in it the dream processes were\r\nsubjected to an undesirable complication on account of the intermixture\r\nof neurotic characters. On the other hand, inseparably connected with my\r\nown dreams was the circumstance that I was obliged to expose more of the\r\nintimacies of my psychic life than I should like and than generally\r\nfalls to the task of an author who is not a poet but an investigator of\r\nnature. This was painful, but unavoidable; I had to put up with the\r\ninevitable in order not to be obliged to forego altogether the\r\ndemonstration of the truth of my psychological results. To be sure, I\r\ncould not at best resist the temptation of disguising some of my\r\nindiscretions through omissions and substitutions, and as often as this\r\nhappened it detracted materially from the value of the examples which I\r\nemployed. I can only express the hope that the reader of this work,\r\nputting himself in my difficult position, will show forbearance, and\r\nalso that all persons who are inclined to take offence at any of the\r\ndreams reported will concede freedom of thought at least to the dream\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there has arisen a demand for a second edition of this rather\r\ndifficult book before the end of the first decade, I owe no gratitude\r\nto the interest of the professional circles to whom I appealed in the\r\npreceding sentences. My colleagues in psychiatry, apparently, have\r\nmade no effort to shake off the first surprise which my new conception\r\nof the dream evoked, and the professional philosophers, who are\r\naccustomed to treat the problem of dream life as a part of the states\r\nof consciousness, devoting to it a few\xe2\x80\x94for the most part\r\nidentical\xe2\x80\x94sentences, have apparently failed to observe that in this\r\nfield could be found all kinds of things which would inevitably lead\r\nto a thorough transformation of our psychological theories. The\r\nbehaviour of the scientific critics could only justify the expectation\r\nthat this work of mine was destined to be buried in oblivion; and the\r\nsmall troop of brave pupils who follow my leadership in the medical\r\napplication of psychoanalysis, and also follow my example in analysing\r\ndreams in order to utilise these analyses in the treatment of\r\nneurotics, would not have exhausted the first edition of the book. I\r\ntherefore feel indebted to that wider circle of intelligent seekers\r\nafter truth whose co-operation has procured for me the invitation to\r\ntake up anew, after nine years, the difficult and in so many respects\r\nfundamental work.\r\n\r\nI am glad to be able to say that I have found little to change. Here and\r\nthere I have inserted new material, added new views from my wider\r\nexperience, and attempted to revise certain points; but everything\r\nessential concerning the dream and its interpretation, as well as the\r\npsychological propositions derived from it, has remained unchanged: at\r\nleast, subjectively, it has stood the test of time. Those who are\r\nacquainted with my other works on the Etiology and Mechanism of the\r\npsychoneuroses, know that I have never offered anything unfinished as\r\nfinished, and that I have always striven to change my assertions in\r\naccordance with my advancing views; but in the realm of the dream life I\r\nhave been able to stand by my first declarations. During the long years\r\nof my work on the problems of the neuroses, I have been repeatedly\r\nconfronted with doubts, and have often made mistakes; but it was always\r\nin the \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretation of dreams\xe2\x80\x9d that I found my bearings. My numerous\r\nscientific opponents, therefore, show an especially sure instinct when\r\nthey refuse to follow me into this territory of dream investigation.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the material used in this book to illustrate the rules of\r\ndream interpretation, drawn chiefly from dreams of my own which have\r\nbeen depreciated and outstripped by events, have in the revision shown a\r\npersistence which resisted substantial changes. For me, indeed, the book\r\nhas still another subjective meaning which I could comprehend only after\r\nit had been completed. It proved to be for me a part of my\r\nself-analysis, a reaction to the death of my father\xe2\x80\x94that is, to the most\r\nsignificant event, the deepest loss, in the life of a man. After I\r\nrecognised this I felt powerless to efface the traces of this influence.\r\nFor the reader, however, it makes no difference from what material he\r\nlearns to value and interpret dreams.\r\n\r\n  BERCHTESGADEN, Summer of 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas a period of nine years elapsed between the first and second\r\neditions of this book, the need for a third edition has appeared after\r\nlittle more than a year. I have reason to be pleased with this change;\r\nbut, just as I have not considered the earlier neglect of my work on the\r\npart of the reader as a proof of its unworthiness, I am unable to find\r\nin the interest manifested at present a proof of its excellence.\r\n\r\nThe progress in scientific knowledge has shown its influence on the\r\n_Interpretation of Dreams_. When I wrote it in 1899 the \xe2\x80\x9cSexual\r\nTheories\xe2\x80\x9d was not yet in existence, and the analysis of complicated\r\nforms of psychoneuroses was still in its infancy. The interpretation of\r\ndreams was destined to aid in the psychological analysis of the\r\nneuroses, but since then the deeper understanding of the neuroses has\r\nreacted on our conception of the dream. The study of dream\r\ninterpretation itself has continued to develop in a direction upon which\r\nnot enough stress was laid in the first edition of this book. From my\r\nown experience, as well as from the works of W. Stekel and others, I\r\nhave since learned to attach a greater value to the extent and the\r\nsignificance of symbolism in dreams (or rather in the unconscious\r\nthinking). Thus much has accumulated in the course of this year which\r\nrequires consideration. I have endeavoured to do justice to this new\r\nmaterial by numerous insertions in the text and by the addition of\r\nfootnotes. If these supplements occasionally threaten to warp the\r\noriginal discussion, or if, even with their aid, we have been\r\nunsuccessful in raising the original text to the _niveau_ of our present\r\nviews, I must beg indulgence for the gaps in the book, as they are only\r\nconsequences and indications of the present rapid development of our\r\nknowledge. I also venture to foretell in what other directions later\r\neditions of the _Interpretation of Dreams_\xe2\x80\x94in case any should be\r\ndemanded\xe2\x80\x94will differ from the present one. They will have, on the one\r\nhand, to include selections from the rich material of poetry, myth,\r\nusage of language, and folk-lore, and, on the other hand, to treat more\r\nprofoundly the relations of the dream to the neuroses and to mental\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nMr. Otto Rank has rendered me valuable service in the selection of the\r\naddenda and in reading the proof sheets. I am gratefully indebted to him\r\nand to many others for their contributions and corrections.\r\n\r\n  VIENNA, Spring of 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSLATOR\xe2\x80\x99S PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the appearance of the author\xe2\x80\x99s _Selected Papers on Hysteria and\r\nother Psychoneuroses_, and _Three Contributions to the Sexual\r\nTheory_,[A] much has been said and written about Freud\xe2\x80\x99s works. Some of\r\nour readers have made an honest endeavour to test and utilise the\r\nauthor\xe2\x80\x99s theories, but they have been handicapped by their inability to\r\nread fluently very difficult German, for only two of Freud\xe2\x80\x99s works have\r\nhitherto been accessible to English readers. For them this work will be\r\nof invaluable assistance. To be sure, numerous articles on the Freudian\r\npsychology have of late made their appearance in our literature;[B] but\r\nthese scattered papers, read by those unacquainted with the original\r\nwork, often serve to confuse rather than enlighten. For Freud cannot be\r\nmastered from the reading of a few pamphlets, or even one or two of his\r\noriginal works. Let me repeat what I have so often said: No one is\r\nreally qualified to use or to judge Freud\xe2\x80\x99s psychoanalytic method who\r\nhas not thoroughly mastered his theory of the neuroses\xe2\x80\x94_The\r\nInterpretation of Dreams_, _Three Contributions to the Sexual Theory_,\r\n_The Psychopathology of Everyday Life_, and _Wit and its Relation to the\r\nUnconscious_, and who has not had considerable experience in analysing\r\nthe dreams and psychopathological actions of himself and others. That\r\nthere is required also a thorough training in normal and abnormal\r\npsychology goes without saying.\r\n\r\n_The Interpretation of Dreams_ is the author\xe2\x80\x99s greatest and most\r\nimportant work; it is here that he develops his psychoanalytic\r\ntechnique, a thorough knowledge of which is absolutely indispensable for\r\nevery worker in this field. The difficult task of making a translation\r\nof this work has, therefore, been undertaken primarily for the purpose\r\nof assisting those who are actively engaged in treating patients by\r\nFreud\xe2\x80\x99s psychoanalytic method. Considered apart from its practical aim,\r\nthe book presents much that is of interest to the psychologist and the\r\ngeneral reader. For, notwithstanding the fact that dreams have of late\r\nyears been the subject of investigation at the hands of many competent\r\nobservers, only few have contributed anything tangible towards their\r\nsolution; it was Freud who divested the dream of its mystery, and solved\r\nits riddles. He not only showed us that the dream is full of meaning,\r\nbut amply demonstrated that it is intimately connected with normal and\r\nabnormal mental life. It is in the treatment of the abnormal mental\r\nstates that we must recognise the most important value of dream\r\ninterpretation. The dream does not only reveal to us the cryptic\r\nmechanisms of hallucinations, delusions, phobias, obsessions, and other\r\npsychopathological conditions, but it is also the most potent instrument\r\nin the removal of these.[C]\r\n\r\nI take this opportunity of expressing my indebtedness to Professor F. C.\r\nPrescott for reading the manuscript and for helping me overcome the\r\nalmost insurmountable difficulties in the translation.\r\n\r\n                                                            A.

I shall furthermore\r\nendeavour to explain the processes which give rise to the strangeness\r\nand obscurity of the dream, and to discover through them the nature of\r\nthe psychic forces which operate, whether in combination or in\r\nopposition, to produce the dream. This accomplished, my investigation\r\nwill terminate, as it will have reached the point where the problem of\r\nthe dream meets with broader problems, the solution of which must be\r\nattempted through other material.\r\n\r\nI must presuppose that the reader is acquainted with the work done by\r\nearlier authors as well as with the present status of the dream problem\r\nin science, since in the course of this treatise I shall not often have\r\noccasion to return to them. For, notwithstanding the effort of several\r\nthousand years, little progress has been made in the scientific\r\nunderstanding of dreams. This has been so universally acknowledged by\r\nthe authors that it seems unnecessary to quote individual opinions. One\r\nwill find in the writings indexed at the end of this book many\r\nstimulating observations and plenty of interesting material for our\r\nsubject, but little or nothing that concerns the true nature of the\r\ndream or that solves definitively any of its enigmas. Still less of\r\ncourse has been transmitted to the knowledge of the educated laity.\r\n\r\nThe first book in which the dream is treated as an object of psychology\r\nseems to be that of Aristotle[1] (_Concerning Dreams and their\r\nInterpretation_). Aristotle asserts that the dream is of demoniacal,\r\nthough not of divine nature, which indeed contains deep meaning, if it\r\nbe correctly interpreted. He was also acquainted with some of the\r\ncharacteristics of dream life, _e.g._, he knew that the dream turns\r\nslight sensations perceived during sleep into great ones (\xe2\x80\x9cone imagines\r\nthat one walks through fire and feels hot, if this or that part of the\r\nbody becomes slightly warmed\xe2\x80\x9d), which led him to conclude that dreams\r\nmight easily betray to the physician the first indications of an\r\nincipient change in the body passing unnoticed during the day. I have\r\nbeen unable to go more deeply into the Aristotelian treatise, because of\r\ninsufficient preparation and lack of skilled assistance.\r\n\r\nAs every one knows, the ancients before Aristotle did not consider the\r\ndream a product of the dreaming mind, but a divine inspiration, and in\r\nancient times the two antagonistic streams, which one finds throughout\r\nin the estimates of dream life, were already noticeable. They\r\ndistinguished between true and valuable dreams, sent to the dreamer to\r\nwarn him or to foretell the future, and vain, fraudulent, and empty\r\ndreams, the object of which was to misguide or lead him to\r\ndestruction.[E] This pre-scientific conception of the dream among the\r\nancients was certainly in perfect keeping with their general view of\r\nlife, which was wont to project as reality in the outer world that which\r\npossessed reality only within the mind. It, moreover, accounted for the\r\nmain impression made upon the waking life by the memory left from the\r\ndream in the morning, for in this memory the dream, as compared with the\r\nrest of the psychic content, seems something strange, coming, as it\r\nwere, from another world. It would likewise be wrong to suppose that the\r\ntheory of the supernatural origin of dreams lacks followers in our own\r\nday; for leaving out of consideration all bigoted and mystical\r\nauthors\xe2\x80\x94who are perfectly justified in adhering to the remnants of the\r\nonce extensive realm of the supernatural until they have been swept away\r\nby scientific explanation\xe2\x80\x94one meets even sagacious men averse to\r\nanything adventurous, who go so far as to base their religious belief in\r\nthe existence and co-operation of superhuman forces on the\r\ninexplicableness of the dream manifestations (Haffner[32]). The validity\r\nascribed to the dream life by some schools of philosophy, _e.g._ the\r\nschool of Schelling, is a distinct echo of the undisputed divinity of\r\ndreams in antiquity, nor is discussion closed on the subject of the\r\nmantic or prophetic power of dreams. This is due to the fact that the\r\nattempted psychological explanations are too inadequate to overcome the\r\naccumulated material, however strongly all those who devote themselves\r\nto a scientific mode of thought may feel that such assertions should be\r\nrepudiated.\r\n\r\nTo write a history of our scientific knowledge of dream problems is so\r\ndifficult because, however valuable some parts of this knowledge may\r\nhave been, no progress in definite directions has been discernible.\r\nThere has been no construction of a foundation of assured results upon\r\nwhich future investigators could continue to build, but every new author\r\ntakes up the same problems afresh and from the very beginning. Were I to\r\nfollow the authors in chronological order, and give a review of the\r\nopinions each has held concerning the problems of the dream, I should be\r\nprevented from drawing a clear and complete picture of the present state\r\nof knowledge on the subject. I have therefore preferred to base the\r\ntreatment upon themes rather than upon the authors, and I shall cite for\r\neach problem of the dream the material found in the literature for its\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nBut as I have not succeeded in mastering the entire literature, which is\r\nwidely disseminated and interwoven with that on other subjects, I must\r\nask my readers to rest content provided no fundamental fact or important\r\nviewpoint be lost in my description.\r\n\r\nUntil recently most authors have been led to treat the subjects of sleep\r\nand dream in the same connection, and with them they have also regularly\r\ntreated analogous states of psychopathology, and other dreamlike states\r\nlike hallucinations, visions, &c. In the more recent works, on the other\r\nhand, there has been a tendency to keep more closely to the theme, and\r\nto take as the subject one single question of the dream life. This\r\nchange, I believe, is an expression of the conviction that enlightenment\r\nand agreement in such obscure matters can only be brought about by a\r\nseries of detailed investigations. It is such a detailed investigation\r\nand one of a special psychological nature, that I would offer here. I\r\nhave little occasion to study the problem of sleep, as it is essentially\r\na psychological problem, although the change of functional\r\ndeterminations for the mental apparatus must be included in the\r\ncharacter of sleep. The literature of sleep will therefore not be\r\nconsidered here.\r\n\r\nA scientific interest in the phenomena of dreams as such leads to the\r\nfollowing in part interdependent inquiries:\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Relation of the Dream to the Waking State._\xe2\x80\x94The na\xc3\xafve\r\njudgment of a person on awakening assumes that the dream\xe2\x80\x94if indeed it\r\ndoes not originate in another world\xe2\x80\x94at any rate has taken the dreamer\r\ninto another world. The old physiologist, Burdach,[8] to whom we are\r\nindebted for a careful and discriminating description of the phenomena\r\nof dreams, expressed this conviction in an often-quoted passage, p. 474:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe waking life never repeats itself with its trials and joys, its\r\npleasures and pains, but, on the contrary, the dream aims to relieve us\r\nof these. Even when our whole mind is filled with one subject, when\r\nprofound sorrow has torn our hearts or when a task has claimed the whole\r\npower of our mentality, the dream either gives us something entirely\r\nstrange, or it takes for its combinations only a few elements from\r\nreality, or it only enters into the strain of our mood and symbolises\r\nreality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nL. Str\xc3\xbcmpell[66] expresses himself to the same effect in his _Nature and\r\nOrigin of Dreams_ (p. 16), a study which is everywhere justly held in\r\nhigh respect: \xe2\x80\x9cHe who dreams turns his back upon the world of waking\r\nconsciousness\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 17). \xe2\x80\x9cIn the dream the memory of the orderly content\r\nof the waking consciousness and its normal behaviour is as good as\r\nentirely lost\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 19). \xe2\x80\x9cThe almost complete isolation of the mind in\r\nthe dream from the regular normal content and course of the waking\r\nstate....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the overwhelming majority of the authors have assumed a contrary\r\nview of the relation of the dream to waking life. Thus Haffner[32] (p.\r\n19): \xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all the dream is the continuation of the waking state.\r\nOur dreams always unite themselves with those ideas which have shortly\r\nbefore been in our consciousness. Careful examination will nearly always\r\nfind a thread by which the dream has connected itself with the\r\nexperience of the previous day.\xe2\x80\x9d Weygandt[75] (p. 6), flatly contradicts\r\nthe above cited statement of Burdach: \xe2\x80\x9cFor it may often be observed,\r\napparently in the great majority of dreams, that they lead us directly\r\nback into everyday life, instead of releasing us from it.\xe2\x80\x9d Maury[48] (p.\r\n56), says in a concise formula: \xe2\x80\x9cNous r\xc3\xaavons de ce que nous avons vu,\r\ndit, d\xc3\xa9sir\xc3\xa9 ou fait.\xe2\x80\x9d Jessen,[36] in his _Psychology_, published in 1855\r\n(p. 530), is somewhat more explicit: \xe2\x80\x9cThe content of dreams is more or\r\nless determined by the individual personality, by age, sex, station in\r\nlife, education, habits, and by events and experiences of the whole past\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ancients had the same idea about the dependence of the dream content\r\nupon life. I cite Radestock[54] (p. 139): \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Xerxes, before his march\r\nagainst Greece, was dissuaded from this resolution by good counsel, but\r\nwas again and again incited by dreams to undertake it, one of the old\r\nrational dream-interpreters of the Persians, Artabanus, told him very\r\nappropriately that dream pictures mostly contain that of which one has\r\nbeen thinking while awake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the didactic poem of Lucretius, _De Rerum Natura_ (IV, v. 959),\r\noccurs this passage:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n           \xe2\x80\x9cEt quo quisque fere studio devinctus adhaeret,\r\n           aut quibus in rebus multum sumus ante morati\r\n           atque in ea ratione fuit contenta magis mens,\r\n           in somnis eadem plerumque videmur obire;\r\n           causidici causas agere et componere leges,\r\n           induperatores pugnare ac proelia obire,\xe2\x80\x9d &c., &c.\r\n\r\nCicero (_De Divinatione_, II) says quite similarly, as does also Maury\r\nmuch later:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaximeque reliquiae earum rerum moventur in animis et agitantur, de\r\nquibus vigilantes aut cogitavimus aut egimus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe contradiction expressed in these two views as to the relation\r\nbetween dream life and waking life seems indeed insoluble. It will\r\ntherefore not be out of place to mention the description of F. W.\r\nHildebrandt[35] (1875), who believes that the peculiarities of the dream\r\ncan generally be described only by calling them a \xe2\x80\x9cseries of contrasts\r\nwhich apparently shade off into contradictions\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 8). \xe2\x80\x9cThe first of\r\nthese contrasts is formed on the one hand by the strict isolation or\r\nseclusion of the dream from true and actual life, and on the other hand\r\nby the continuous encroachment of the one upon the other, and the\r\nconstant dependency of one upon the other. The dream is something\r\nabsolutely separated from the reality experienced during the waking\r\nstate; one may call it an existence hermetically sealed up and separated\r\nfrom real life by an unsurmountable chasm. It frees us from reality,\r\nextinguishes normal recollection of reality, and places us in another\r\nworld and in a totally different life, which at bottom has nothing in\r\ncommon with reality....\xe2\x80\x9d Hildebrandt then asserts that in falling asleep\r\nour whole being, with all its forms of existence, disappears \xe2\x80\x9cas through\r\nan invisible trap door.\xe2\x80\x9d In the dream one is perhaps making a voyage to\r\nSt. Helena in order to offer the imprisoned Napoleon something exquisite\r\nin the way of Moselle wine. One is most amicably received by the\r\nex-emperor, and feels almost sorry when the interesting illusion is\r\ndestroyed on awakening. But let us now compare the situation of the\r\ndream with reality. The dreamer has never been a wine merchant, and has\r\nno desire to become one. He has never made a sea voyage, and St. Helena\r\nis the last place he would take as destination for such a voyage. The\r\ndreamer entertains no sympathetic feeling for Napoleon, but on the\r\ncontrary a strong patriotic hatred. And finally the dreamer was not yet\r\namong the living when Napoleon died on the island; so that it was beyond\r\nthe reach of possibility for him to have had any personal relations with\r\nNapoleon. The dream experience thus appears as something strange,\r\ninserted between two perfectly harmonising and succeeding periods.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d continues Hildebrandt, \xe2\x80\x9cthe opposite is seemingly just\r\nas true and correct. I believe that hand in hand with this seclusion and\r\nisolation there can still exist the most intimate relation and\r\nconnection. We may justly say that no matter what the dream offers, it\r\nfinds its material in reality and in the psychic life arrayed around\r\nthis reality. However strange the dream may seem, it can never detach\r\nitself from reality, and its most sublime as well as its most farcical\r\nstructures must always borrow their elementary material either from what\r\nwe have seen with our eyes in the outer world, or from what has\r\npreviously found a place somewhere in our waking thoughts; in other\r\nwords, it must be taken from what we had already experienced either\r\nobjectively or subjectively.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Material of the Dream.\xe2\x80\x94Memory in the Dream._\xe2\x80\x94That all the\r\nmaterial composing the content of the dream in some way originates in\r\nexperience, that it is reproduced in the dream, or recalled,\xe2\x80\x94this at\r\nleast may be taken as an indisputable truth. Yet it would be wrong to\r\nassume that such connection between dream content and reality will be\r\nreadily disclosed as an obvious product of the instituted comparison. On\r\nthe contrary, the connection must be carefully sought, and in many cases\r\nit succeeds in eluding discovery for a long time. The reason for this is\r\nto be found in a number of peculiarities evinced by the memory in\r\ndreams, which, though universally known, have hitherto entirely eluded\r\nexplanation. It will be worth while to investigate exhaustively these\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that matter appears in the dream content which one\r\ncannot recognise later in the waking state as belonging to one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknowledge and experience. One remembers well enough having dreamed about\r\nthe subject in question, but cannot recall the fact or time of the\r\nexperience. The dreamer is therefore in the dark as to the source from\r\nwhich the dream has been drawing, and is even tempted to believe an\r\nindependently productive activity on the part of the dream, until, often\r\nlong afterwards, a new episode brings back to recollection a former\r\nexperience given up as lost, and thus reveals the source of the dream.\r\nOne is thus forced to admit that something has been known and remembered\r\nin the dream that has been withdrawn from memory during the waking\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nDelb\xc5\x93uf[16] narrates from his own experience an especially impressive\r\nexample of this kind. He saw in his dream the courtyard of his house\r\ncovered with snow, and found two little lizards half-frozen and buried\r\nin the snow. Being a lover of animals, he picked them up, warmed them,\r\nand put them back into a crevice in the wall which was reserved for\r\nthem. He also gave them some small fern leaves that had been growing on\r\nthe wall, which he knew they were fond of. In the dream he knew the name\r\nof the plant: _Asplenium ruta muralis_. The dream then continued,\r\nreturning after a digression to the lizards, and to his astonishment\r\nDelb\xc5\x93uf saw two other little animals falling upon what was left of the\r\nferns. On turning his eyes to the open field he saw a fifth and a sixth\r\nlizard running into the hole in the wall, and finally the street was\r\ncovered with a procession of lizards, all wandering in the same\r\ndirection, &c.\r\n\r\nIn his waking state Delb\xc5\x93uf knew only a few Latin names of plants, and\r\nnothing of the Asplenium. To his great surprise he became convinced that\r\na fern of this name really existed and that the correct name was\r\n_Asplenium ruta muraria_, which the dream had slightly disfigured. An\r\naccidental coincidence could hardly be considered, but it remained a\r\nmystery for Delb\xc5\x93uf whence he got his knowledge of the name Asplenium in\r\nthe dream.\r\n\r\nThe dream occurred in 1862. Sixteen years later, while at the house of\r\none of his friends, the philosopher noticed a small album containing\r\ndried plants resembling the albums that are sold as souvenirs to\r\nvisitors in many parts of Switzerland. A sudden recollection occurred to\r\nhim; he opened the herbarium, and discovered therein the Asplenium of\r\nhis dream, and recognised his own handwriting in the accompanying Latin\r\nname. The connection could now be traced. While on her wedding trip, a\r\nsister of this friend visited Delb\xc5\x93uf in 1860\xe2\x80\x94two years prior to the\r\nlizard dream. She had with her at the time this album, which was\r\nintended for her brother, and Delb\xc5\x93uf took the trouble to write, at the\r\ndictation of a botanist, under each of the dried plants the Latin name.\r\n\r\nThe favourable accident which made possible the report of this valuable\r\nexample also permitted Delb\xc5\x93uf to trace another portion of this dream to\r\nits forgotten source. One day in 1877 he came upon an old volume of an\r\nillustrated journal, in which he found pictured the whole procession of\r\nlizards just as he had dreamed it in 1862. The volume bore the date of\r\n1861, and Delb\xc5\x93uf could recall that he had subscribed to the journal\r\nfrom its first appearance.\r\n\r\nThat the dream has at its disposal recollections which are inaccessible\r\nto the waking state is such a remarkable and theoretically important\r\nfact that I should like to urge more attention to it by reporting\r\nseveral other \xe2\x80\x9cHypermnesic Dreams.\xe2\x80\x9d Maury[48] relates that for some time\r\nthe word Mussidan used to occur to his mind during the day. He knew it\r\nto be the name of a French city, but nothing else. One night he dreamed\r\nof a conversation with a certain person who told him that she came from\r\nMussidan, and, in answer to his question where the city was, she\r\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x9cMussidan is a principal country town in the D\xc3\xa9partement de La\r\nDordogne.\xe2\x80\x9d On waking, Maury put no faith in the information received in\r\nhis dream; the geographical lexicon, however, showed it to be perfectly\r\ncorrect. In this case the superior knowledge of the dream is confirmed,\r\nbut the forgotten source of this knowledge has not been traced.\r\n\r\nJessen[36] tells (p. 55) of a quite similar dream occurrence, from more\r\nremote times. Among others we may here mention the dream of the elder\r\nScaliger (Hennings, _l.c._, p. 300), who wrote a poem in praise of\r\ncelebrated men of Verona, and to whom a man, named Brugnolus, appeared\r\nin a dream, complaining that he had been neglected. Though Scaliger did\r\nnot recall ever having heard of him, he wrote some verses in his honour,\r\nand his son later discovered at Verona that a Brugnolus had formerly\r\nbeen famous there as a critic.\r\n\r\nMyers is said to have published a whole collection of such hypermnesic\r\ndreams in the _Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research_, which\r\nare unfortunately inaccessible to me. I believe every one who occupies\r\nhimself with dreams will recognise as a very common phenomenon the fact\r\nthat the dream gives proof of knowing and recollecting matters unknown\r\nto the waking person. In my psychoanalytic investigations of nervous\r\npatients, of which I shall speak later, I am every week more than once\r\nin position to convince my patients from their dreams that they are well\r\nacquainted with quotations, obscene expressions, &c., and that they make\r\nuse of these in their dreams, although they have forgotten them in the\r\nwaking state. I shall cite here a simple case of dream hypermnesia\r\nbecause it was easy to trace the source which made the knowledge\r\naccessible to the dream.\r\n\r\nA patient dreamed in a lengthy connection that he ordered a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKontusz\xc3\xb3wka\xe2\x80\x9d in a caf\xc3\xa9, and after reporting this inquired what it might\r\nmean, as he never heard the name before. I was able to answer that\r\nKontusz\xc3\xb3wka was a Polish liquor which he could not have invented in his\r\ndream, as the name had long been familiar to me in advertisements. The\r\npatient would not at first believe me, but some days later, after he had\r\nrealised his dream of the caf\xc3\xa9, he noticed the name on a signboard at\r\nthe street corner, which he had been obliged to pass for months at least\r\ntwice a day.\r\n\r\nI have learned from my own dreams how largely the discovery of the\r\norigin of some of the dream elements depends on accident. Thus, for\r\nyears before writing this book, I was haunted by the picture of a very\r\nsimply formed church tower which I could not recall having seen. I then\r\nsuddenly recognised it with absolute certainty at a small station\r\nbetween Salzburg and Reichenhall. This was in the later nineties, and I\r\nhad travelled over the road for the first time in the year 1886. In\r\nlater years, when I was already busily engaged in the study of dreams, I\r\nwas quite annoyed at the frequent recurrence of the dream picture of a\r\ncertain peculiar locality. I saw it in definite local relation to my\r\nperson\xe2\x80\x94to my left, a dark space from which many grotesque sandstone\r\nfigures stood out. A glimmer of recollection, which I did not quite\r\ncredit, told me it was the entrance to a beer-cellar, but I could\r\nexplain neither the meaning nor the origin of this dream picture. In\r\n1907 I came by chance to Padua, which, to my regret, I had been unable\r\nto visit since 1895. My first visit to this beautiful university city\r\nwas unsatisfactory; I was unable to see Giotto\xe2\x80\x99s frescoes in the church\r\nof the Madonna dell\xe2\x80\x99 Arena, and on my way there turned back on being\r\ninformed that the little church was closed on the day. On my second\r\nvisit, twelve years later, I thought of compensating myself for this,\r\nand before everything else I started out for Madonna dell\xe2\x80\x99 Arena. On the\r\nstreet leading to it, on my left, probably at the place where I had\r\nturned in 1895, I discovered the locality which I had so often seen in\r\nthe dream, with its sandstone figures. It was in fact the entrance to a\r\nrestaurant garden.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources from which the dream draws material for\r\nreproduction\xe2\x80\x94material which in part is not recalled or employed in\r\nwaking thought\xe2\x80\x94is to be found in childhood. I shall merely cite some of\r\nthe authors who have observed and emphasized this.\r\n\r\nHildebrandt[35] (p. 23): \xe2\x80\x9cIt has already been expressly admitted that\r\nthe dream sometimes brings back to the mind with wonderful reproductive\r\nability remote and even forgotten experiences from the earliest\r\nperiods.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStr\xc3\xbcmpell[66] (p. 40): \xe2\x80\x9cThe subject becomes more interesting when we\r\nremember how the dream sometimes brings forth, as it were, from among\r\nthe deepest and heaviest strata which later years have piled upon the\r\nearliest childhood experiences, the pictures of certain places, things,\r\nand persons, quite uninjured and with their original freshness. This is\r\nnot limited merely to such impressions as have gained vivid\r\nconsciousness during their origin or have become impressed with strong\r\npsychic validity, and then later return in the dream as actual\r\nreminiscences, causing pleasure to the awakened consciousness. On the\r\ncontrary, the depths of the dream memory comprise also such pictures of\r\npersons, things, places, and early experiences as either possessed but\r\nlittle consciousness and no psychic value at all, or have long ago lost\r\nboth, and therefore appear totally strange and unknown both in the dream\r\nand in the waking state, until their former origin is revealed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVolkelt[72] (p. 119): \xe2\x80\x9cIt is essentially noteworthy how easily infantile\r\nand youthful reminiscences enter into the dream. What we have long\r\nceased to think about, what has long since lost for us all importance,\r\nis constantly recalled by the dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sway of the dream over the infantile material, which, as is well\r\nknown, mostly occupies the gaps in the conscious memory, causes the\r\norigin of interesting hypermnestic dreams, a few of which I shall here\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nMaury[48] relates (p. 92) that as a child he often went from his native\r\ncity, Meaux, to the neighbouring Trilport, where his father\r\nsuperintended the construction of a bridge. On a certain night a dream\r\ntransported him to Trilport, and he was again playing in the city\r\nstreets. A man approached him wearing some sort of uniform. Maury asked\r\nhim his name, and he introduced himself, saying that his name was C\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94,\r\nand that he was a bridge guard. On waking, Maury, who still doubted the\r\nreality of the reminiscence, asked his old servant, who had been with\r\nhim in his childhood, whether she remembered a man of this name.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer, \xe2\x80\x9che used to be watchman on the bridge which\r\nyour father was building at that time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaury reports another example demonstrating just as nicely the\r\nreliability of infantile reminiscences appearing in dreams. Mr. F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, who\r\nhad lived as a child in Montbrison, decided to visit his home and old\r\nfriends of his family after an absence of twenty-five years. The night\r\nbefore his departure he dreamt that he had reached his destination, and\r\nthat he met near Montbrison a man, whom he did not know by sight, who\r\ntold him he was Mr. F., a friend of his father. The dreamer remembered\r\nthat as a child he had known a gentleman of this name, but on waking he\r\ncould no longer recall his features. Several days later, having really\r\narrived at Montbrison, he found the supposedly unknown locality of his\r\ndream, and there met a man whom he at once recognised as the Mr. F. of\r\nhis dream. The real person was only older than the one in the dream\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nI may here relate one of my own dreams in which the remembered\r\nimpression is replaced by an association. In my dream I saw a person\r\nwhom I recognised, while dreaming, as the physician of my native town.\r\nThe features were indistinct and confused with the picture of one of my\r\ncolleague teachers, whom I still see occasionally. What association\r\nthere was between the two persons I could not discover on awakening. But\r\nupon questioning my mother about the physician of my early childhood, I\r\ndiscovered that he was a one-eyed man. My teacher, whose figure\r\nconcealed that of the physician in the dream, was also one-eyed. I have\r\nnot seen the physician for thirty-eight years, and I have not to my\r\nknowledge thought of him in my waking state, although a scar on my chin\r\nmight have reminded me of his help.\r\n\r\nAs if to counterbalance the immense r\xc3\xb4le ascribed to the infantile\r\nimpressions in the dream, many authors assert that the majority of\r\ndreams show elements from the most recent time. Thus Robert[55] (p. 46)\r\ndeclares that the normal dream generally occupies itself only with the\r\nimpressions of the recent days. We learn indeed that the theory of the\r\ndream advanced by Robert imperatively demands that the old impressions\r\nshould be pushed back, and the recent ones brought to the front.\r\nNevertheless the fact claimed by Robert really exists; I can confirm\r\nthis from my own investigations. Nelson,[50] an American author, thinks\r\nthat the impressions most frequently found in the dream date from two or\r\nthree days before, as if the impressions of the day immediately\r\npreceding the dream were not sufficiently weakened and remote.\r\n\r\nMany authors who are convinced of the intimate connection between the\r\ndream content and the waking state are impressed by the fact that\r\nimpressions which have intensely occupied the waking mind appear in the\r\ndream only after they have been to some extent pushed aside from the\r\nelaboration of the waking thought. Thus, as a rule, we do not dream of a\r\ndead beloved person while we are still overwhelmed with sorrow. Still\r\nMiss Hallam,[33] one of the latest observers, has collected examples\r\nshowing the very opposite behaviour, and claims for the point the right\r\nof individual psychology.\r\n\r\nThe third and the most remarkable and incomprehensible peculiarity of\r\nthe memory in dreams, is shown in the selection of the reproduced\r\nmaterial, for stress is laid not only on the most significant, but also\r\non the most indifferent and superficial reminiscences. On this point I\r\nshall quote those authors who have expressed their surprise in the most\r\nemphatic manner.\r\n\r\nHildebrandt[35] (p. 11): \xe2\x80\x9cFor it is a remarkable fact that dreams do\r\nnot, as a rule, take their elements from great and deep-rooted events or\r\nfrom the powerful and urgent interests of the preceding day, but from\r\nunimportant matters, from the most worthless fragments of recent\r\nexperience or of a more remote past. The most shocking death in our\r\nfamily, the impressions of which keep us awake long into the night,\r\nbecomes obliterated from our memories, until the first moment of\r\nawakening brings it back to us with depressing force. On the other hand,\r\nthe wart on the forehead of a passing stranger, of whom we did not think\r\nfor a second after he was out of sight, plays its part in our dreams.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStr\xc3\xbcmpell[66] (p. 39): \xe2\x80\x9c... such cases where the analysis of a dream\r\nbrings to light elements which, although derived from events of the\r\nprevious day or the day before the last, yet prove to be so unimportant\r\nand worthless for the waking state that they merge into forgetfulness\r\nshortly after coming to light. Such occurrences may be statements of\r\nothers heard accidentally or actions superficially observed, or fleeting\r\nperceptions of things or persons, or single phrases from books, &c.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHavelock Ellis[23] (p. 727): \xe2\x80\x9cThe profound emotions of waking life, the\r\nquestions and problems on which we spread our chief voluntary mental\r\nenergy, are not those which usually present themselves at once to\r\ndream-consciousness. It is, so far as the immediate past is concerned,\r\nmostly the trifling, the incidental, the \xe2\x80\x9cforgotten\xe2\x80\x9d impressions of\r\ndaily life which reappear in our dreams. The psychic activities that are\r\nawake most intensely are those that sleep most profoundly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBinz[4] (p. 45) takes occasion from the above-mentioned characteristics\r\nof the memory in dreams to express his dissatisfaction with explanations\r\nof dreams which he himself has approved of: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the normal dream raises\r\nsimilar questions. Why do we not always dream of memory impressions from\r\nthe preceding days, instead of going back to the almost forgotten past\r\nlying far behind us without any perceptible reason? Why in a dream does\r\nconsciousness so often revive the impression of indifferent memory\r\npictures while the cerebral cells bearing the most sensitive records of\r\nexperience remain for the most part inert and numb, unless an acute\r\nrevival during the waking state has shortly before excited them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe can readily understand how the strange preference of the dream memory\r\nfor the indifferent and hence the unnoticed details of daily experience\r\nmust usually lead us to overlook altogether the dependence of the dream\r\non the waking state, or at least make it difficult to prove this\r\ndependence in any individual case. It thus happened that in the\r\nstatistical treatment of her own and her friend\xe2\x80\x99s dreams, Miss Whiton\r\nCalkins[12] found 11 per cent. of the entire number that showed no\r\nrelation to the waking state. Hildebrandt was certainly correct in his\r\nassertion that all our dream pictures could be genetically explained if\r\nwe devoted enough time and material to the tracing of their origin. To\r\nbe sure, he calls this \xe2\x80\x9ca most tedious and thankless job.\xe2\x80\x9d For it would\r\nat most lead us to ferret out all kinds of quite worthless psychic\r\nmaterial from the most remote corners of the memory chamber, and to\r\nbring to light some very indifferent moments from the remote past which\r\nwere perhaps buried the next hour after their appearance. I must,\r\nhowever, express my regret that this discerning author refrained from\r\nfollowing the road whose beginning looked so unpromising; it would have\r\nled him directly to the centre of the dream problem.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of the memory in dreams is surely most significant for\r\nevery theory of memory in general. It teaches us that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing which we\r\nhave once psychically possessed is ever entirely lost\xe2\x80\x9d (Scholz[59]); or\r\nas Delb\xc5\x93uf puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cque toute impression m\xc3\xaame la plus insignifiante,\r\nlaisse une trace inalt\xc3\xa9rable, ind\xc3\xa9finiment susceptible de repara\xc3\xaetre au\r\njour,\xe2\x80\x9d a conclusion to which we are urged by so many of the other\r\npathological manifestations of the psychic life. Let us now bear in mind\r\nthis extraordinary capability of the memory in the dream, in order to\r\nperceive vividly the contradictions which must be advanced in certain\r\ndream theories to be mentioned later, when they endeavour to explain the\r\nabsurdities and incoherence of dreams through a partial forgetting of\r\nwhat we have known during the day.\r\n\r\nOne might even think of reducing the phenomenon of dreaming to that of\r\nmemory, and of regarding the dream as the manifestation of an activity\r\nof reproduction which does not rest even at night, and which is an end\r\nin itself. Views like those expressed by Pilcz[51] would corroborate\r\nthis, according to which intimate relations are demonstrable between the\r\ntime of dreaming and the contents of the dream from the fact that the\r\nimpressions reproduced by the dream in sound sleep belong to the\r\nremotest past while those reproduced towards morning are of recent\r\norigin. But such a conception is rendered improbable from the outset by\r\nthe manner of the dream\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour towards the material to be\r\nremembered. Str\xc3\xbcmpell[66] justly calls our attention to the fact that\r\nrepetitions of experiences do not occur in the dream. To be sure the\r\ndream makes an effort in that direction, but the next link is wanting,\r\nor appears in changed form, or it is replaced by something entirely\r\nnovel. The dream shows only fragments of reproduction; this is so often\r\nthe rule that it admits of theoretical application. Still there are\r\nexceptions in which the dream repeats an episode as thoroughly as our\r\nmemory would in its waking state. Delb\xc5\x93uf tells of one of his university\r\ncolleagues who in his dream repeated, with all its details, a dangerous\r\nwagon ride in which he escaped accident as if by miracle. Miss\r\nCalkins[12] mentions two dreams, the contents of which exactly\r\nreproduced incidents from the day before, and I shall later take\r\noccasion to report an example which came to my notice, showing a\r\nchildish experience which returned unchanged in a dream.[F]\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Dream Stimuli and Dream Sources._\xe2\x80\x94What is meant by dream stimuli\r\nand dream sources may be explained by referring to the popular saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDreams come from the stomach.\xe2\x80\x9d This notion conceals a theory which\r\nconceives the dream as a result of a disturbance of sleep. We should not\r\nhave dreamed if some disturbing element had not arisen in sleep, and the\r\ndream is the reaction from this disturbance.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the exciting causes of dreams takes up the most space\r\nin the descriptions of the authors. That this problem could appear only\r\nafter the dream had become an object of biological investigation is\r\nself-evident. The ancients who conceived the dream as a divine\r\ninspiration had no need of looking for its exciting source; to them the\r\ndream resulted from the will of the divine or demoniacal powers, and its\r\ncontent was the product of their knowledge or intention. Science,\r\nhowever, soon raised the question whether the stimulus to the dream is\r\nalways the same, or whether it might be manifold, and thus led to the\r\nquestion whether the causal explanation of the dream belongs to\r\npsychology or rather to physiology. Most authors seem to assume that the\r\ncauses of the disturbance of sleep, and hence the sources of the dream,\r\nmight be of various natures, and that physical as well as mental\r\nirritations might assume the r\xc3\xb4le of dream inciters. Opinions differ\r\ngreatly in preferring this or that one of the dream sources, in ranking\r\nthem, and indeed as to their importance for the origin of dreams.\r\n\r\nWherever the enumeration of dream sources is complete we ultimately find\r\nfour forms, which are also utilised for the division of dreams:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n   I. External (objective) sensory stimuli.\r\n\r\n  II. Internal (subjective) sensory stimuli.\r\n\r\n III. Internal (organic) physical excitations.\r\n\r\n  IV. Purely psychical exciting sources.\r\n\r\nI. _The External Sensory Stimuli._\xe2\x80\x94The younger Str\xc3\xbcmpell, son of the\r\nphilosopher whose writings on the subject have already more than once\r\nserved us as a guide in the problem of dreams, has, as is well known,\r\nreported his observations on a patient who was afflicted with general\r\nan\xc3\xa6sthesia of the skin and with paralysis of several of the higher\r\nsensory organs. This man merged into sleep when his few remaining\r\nsensory paths from the outer world were shut off. When we wish to sleep\r\nwe are wont to strive for a situation resembling the one in Str\xc3\xbcmpell\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexperiment. We close the most important sensory paths, the eyes, and we\r\nendeavour to keep away from the other senses every stimulus and every\r\nchange of the stimuli acting upon them. We then fall asleep, although we\r\nare never perfectly successful in our preparations. We can neither keep\r\nthe stimuli away from the sensory organs altogether, nor can we fully\r\nextinguish the irritability of the sensory organs. That we may at any\r\ntime be awakened by stronger stimuli should prove to us \xe2\x80\x9cthat the mind\r\nhas remained in constant communication with the material world even\r\nduring sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d The sensory stimuli which reach us during sleep may\r\neasily become the source of dreams.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many stimuli of such nature, ranging from those that\r\nare unavoidable, being brought on by the sleeping state or at least\r\noccasionally induced by it, to the accidental waking stimuli which are\r\nadapted or calculated to put an end to sleep. Thus a strong light may\r\nforce itself into the eyes, a noise may become perceptible, or some\r\nodoriferous matter may irritate the mucous membrane of the nose. In the\r\nspontaneous movements of sleep we may lay bare parts of the body and\r\nthus expose them to a sensation of cold, or through change of position\r\nwe may produce sensations of pressure and touch. A fly may bite us, or a\r\nslight accident at night may simultaneously attack more than one sense.\r\nObservers have called attention to a whole series of dreams in which the\r\nstimulus verified on waking, and a part of the dream content\r\ncorresponded to such a degree that the stimulus could be recognised as\r\nthe source of the dream.\r\n\r\nI shall here cite a number of such dreams collected by Jessen[36] (p.\r\n527), traceable to more or less accidental objective sensory stimuli.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery indistinctly perceived noise gives rise to corresponding dream\r\npictures; the rolling of thunder takes us into the thick of battle, the\r\ncrowing of a cock may be transformed into human shrieks of terror, and\r\nthe creaking of a door may conjure up dreams of burglars breaking into\r\nthe house. When one of our blankets slips off at night we may dream that\r\nwe are walking about naked or falling into the water. If we lie\r\ndiagonally across the bed with our feet extending beyond the edge, we\r\nmay dream of standing on the brink of a terrifying precipice, or of\r\nfalling from a steep height. Should our head accidentally get under the\r\npillow we may then imagine a big rock hanging over us and about to crush\r\nus under its weight. Accumulation of semen produces voluptuous dreams,\r\nand local pain the idea of suffering ill treatment, of hostile attacks,\r\nor of accidental bodily injuries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeier (_Versuch einer Erkl\xc3\xa4rung des Nachtwandelns_, Halle, 1758, p.\r\n33), once dreamed of being assaulted by several persons who threw him\r\nflat on the ground and drove a stake into the ground between his big and\r\nsecond toes. While imagining this in his dream he suddenly awoke and\r\nfelt a blade of straw sticking between his toes. The same author,\r\naccording to Hemmings (_Von den Traumen und Nachtwandeln_, Weimar, 1784,\r\np. 258) dreamed on another occasion that he was being hanged when his\r\nshirt was pinned somewhat tight around his neck. Hauffbauer dreamed in\r\nhis youth of having fallen from a high wall and found upon waking that\r\nthe bedstead had come apart, and that he had actually fallen to the\r\nfloor.... Gregory relates that he once applied a hot-water bottle to his\r\nfeet, and dreamed of taking a trip to the summit of Mount \xc3\x86tna, where he\r\nfound the heat on the ground almost unbearable. After having applied a\r\nblistering plaster to his head, a second man dreamed of being scalped by\r\nIndians; a third, whose shirt was damp, dreamed of being dragged through\r\na stream. An attack of gout caused the patient to believe that he was in\r\nthe hands of the Inquisition, and suffering pains of torture (Macnish).\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe argument based upon the resemblance between stimulus and dream\r\ncontent is reinforced if through a systematic induction of stimuli we\r\nsucceed in producing dreams corresponding to the stimuli. According to\r\nMacnish such experiments have already been made by Giron de\r\nBuzareingues. \xe2\x80\x9cHe left his knee exposed and dreamed of travelling in a\r\nmail coach at night. He remarked in this connection that travellers\r\nwould well know how cold the knees become in a coach at night. Another\r\ntime he left the back of his head uncovered, and dreamed of taking part\r\nin a religious ceremony in the open air. In the country where he lived\r\nit was customary to keep the head always covered except on such\r\noccasions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaury[48] reports new observations on dreams produced in himself. (A\r\nnumber of other attempts produced no results.)\r\n\r\n1. He was tickled with a feather on his lips and on the tip of his nose.\r\nHe dreamed of awful torture, viz. that a mask of pitch was stuck to his\r\nface and then forcibly torn off, taking the skin with it.\r\n\r\n2. Scissors were sharpened on pincers. He heard bells ringing, then\r\nsounds of alarm which took him back to the June days of 1848.\r\n\r\n3. Cologne water was put on his nose. He found himself in Cairo in the\r\nshop of John Maria Farina. This was followed by mad adventures which he\r\nwas unable to reproduce.\r\n\r\n4. His neck was lightly pinched. He dreamed that a blistering plaster\r\nwas put on him, and thought of a doctor who treated him in his\r\nchildhood.\r\n\r\n5. A hot iron was brought near his face. He dreamed that _chauffeurs_[G]\r\nbroke into the house and forced the occupants to give up their money by\r\nsticking their feet into burning coals. The Duchess of Abrant\xc3\xa9s, whose\r\nsecretary he imagined himself in the dream, then entered.\r\n\r\n6. A drop of water was let fall on his forehead. He imagined himself in\r\nItaly perspiring heavily and drinking white wine of Orvieto.\r\n\r\n7. When a burning candle was repeatedly focussed on him through red\r\npaper, he dreamed of the weather, of heat, and of a storm at sea which\r\nhe once experienced in the English Channel.\r\n\r\nD\xe2\x80\x99Hervey,[34] Weygandt,[75] and others have made other attempts to\r\nproduce dreams experimentally.\r\n\r\nMany have observed the striking skill of the dream in interweaving into\r\nits structure sudden impressions from the outer world in such a manner\r\nas to present a gradually prepared and initiated catastrophe\r\n(Hildebrandt)[35]. \xe2\x80\x9cIn former years,\xe2\x80\x9d this author relates, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\noccasionally made use of an alarm clock in order to wake regularly at a\r\ncertain hour in the morning. It probably happened hundreds of times that\r\nthe sound of this instrument fitted into an apparently very long and\r\nconnected dream, as if the entire dream had been especially designed for\r\nit, as if it found in this sound its appropriate and logically\r\nindispensable point, its inevitable issue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shall cite three of these alarm-clock dreams for another purpose.\r\n\r\nVolkelt (p. 68) relates: \xe2\x80\x9cA composer once dreamed that he was teaching\r\nschool, and was just explaining something to his pupils. He had almost\r\nfinished when he turned to one of the boys with the question: \xe2\x80\x98Did you\r\nunderstand me?\xe2\x80\x99 The boy cried out like one possessed \xe2\x80\x98Ya.\xe2\x80\x99 Annoyed at\r\nthis, he reprimanded him for shouting. But now the entire class was\r\nscreaming \xe2\x80\x98Orya,\xe2\x80\x99 then \xe2\x80\x98Euryo,\xe2\x80\x99 and finally \xe2\x80\x98Feueryo.\xe2\x80\x99 He was now\r\naroused by an actual alarm of fire in the street.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGarnier (_Trait\xc3\xa9 des Facult\xc3\xa9s de l\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\x82me_, 1865), reported by\r\nRadestock,[54] relates that Napoleon I., while sleeping in a carriage,\r\nwas awakened from a dream by an explosion which brought back to him the\r\ncrossing of the Tagliamento and the bombarding of the Austrians, so that\r\nhe started up crying, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are undermined!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe following dream of Maury[48] has become celebrated. He was sick, and\r\nremained in bed; his mother sat beside him. He then dreamed of the reign\r\nof terror at the time of the Revolution. He took part in terrible scenes\r\nof murder, and finally he himself was summoned before the Tribunal.\r\nThere he saw Robespierre, Marat, Fouquier-Tinville, and all the sorry\r\nheroes of that cruel epoch; he had to give an account of himself, and,\r\nafter all sort of incidents which did not fix themselves in his memory,\r\nhe was sentenced to death. Accompanied by an enormous crowd, he was led\r\nto the place of execution. He mounted the scaffold, the executioner tied\r\nhim to the board, it tipped, and the knife of the guillotine fell. He\r\nfelt his head severed from the trunk, and awakened in terrible anxiety,\r\nonly to find that the top piece of the bed had fallen down, and had\r\nactually struck his cervical vertebra in the same manner as the knife of\r\na guillotine.\r\n\r\nThis dream gave rise to an interesting discussion introduced by Le\r\nLorrain[45] and Egger[20] in the _Revue Philosophique_. The question was\r\nwhether, and how, it was possible for the dreamer to crowd together an\r\namount of dream content apparently so large in the short space of time\r\nelapsing between the perception of the waking stimulus and the\r\nawakening.\r\n\r\nExamples of this nature make it appear that the objective stimuli during\r\nsleep are the most firmly established of all the dream sources; indeed,\r\nit is the only stimulus which plays any part in the layman\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge.\r\nIf we ask an educated person, who is, however, unacquainted with the\r\nliterature of dreams, how dreams originate, he is sure to answer by\r\nreferring to a case familiar to him in which a dream has been explained\r\nafter waking by a recognised objective stimulus. Scientific\r\ninvestigation cannot, however, stop here, but is incited to further\r\nresearch by the observation that the stimulus influencing the senses\r\nduring sleep does not appear in the dream at all in its true form, but\r\nis replaced by some other presentation which is in some way related to\r\nit. But the relation existing between the stimulus and the result of the\r\ndream is, according to Maury,[47] \xe2\x80\x9cune affinit\xc3\xa9 quelconque mais qui\r\nn\xe2\x80\x99est pas unique et exclusive\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 72). If we read, _e.g._, three of\r\nHildebrandt\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAlarm Clock Dreams,\xe2\x80\x9d we will then have to inquire why the\r\nsame stimulus evoked so many different results, and why just these\r\nresults and no others.\r\n\r\n(P. 37). \xe2\x80\x9cI am taking a walk on a beautiful spring morning. I saunter\r\nthrough the green fields to a neighbouring village, where I see the\r\nnatives going to church in great numbers, wearing their holiday attire\r\nand carrying their hymn-books under their arms. I remember that it is\r\nSunday, and that the morning service will soon begin. I decide to attend\r\nit, but as I am somewhat overheated I also decide to cool off in the\r\ncemetery surrounding the church. While reading the various epitaphs, I\r\nhear the sexton ascend the tower and see the small village bell in the\r\ncupola which is about to give signal for the beginning of the devotions.\r\nFor another short while it hangs motionless, then it begins to swing,\r\nand suddenly its notes resound so clearly and penetratingly that my\r\nsleep comes to an end. But the sound of bells comes from the alarm\r\nclock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA second combination. It is a clear day, the streets are covered with\r\ndeep snow. I have promised to take part in a sleigh-ride, but have had\r\nto wait for some time before it was announced that the sleigh is in\r\nfront of my house. The preparations for getting into the sleigh are now\r\nmade. I put on my furs and adjust my muff, and at last I am in my place.\r\nBut the departure is still delayed, until the reins give the impatient\r\nhorses the perceptible sign. They start, and the sleigh bells, now\r\nforcibly shaken, begin their familiar janizary music with a force that\r\ninstantly tears the gossamer of my dream. Again it is only the shrill\r\nsound of my alarm clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill a third example. \xe2\x80\x9cI see the kitchen-maid walk along the corridor\r\nto the dining-room with several dozen plates piled up. The porcelain\r\ncolumn in her arms seems to me to be in danger of losing its\r\nequilibrium. \xe2\x80\x98Take care,\xe2\x80\x99 I exclaim, \xe2\x80\x98you will drop the whole pile.\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\nusual retort is naturally not wanting\xe2\x80\x94that she is used to such things.\r\nMeanwhile I continue to follow her with my worried glance, and behold!\r\nat the door-step the fragile dishes fall, tumble, and roll across the\r\nfloor in hundreds of pieces. But I soon notice that the noise continuing\r\nendlessly is not really a rattling but a true ringing, and with this\r\nringing the dreamer now becomes aware that the alarm clock has done its\r\nduty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question why the dreaming mind misjudges the nature of the objective\r\nsensory stimulus has been answered by Str\xc3\xbcmpell,[66] and almost\r\nidentically by Wundt,[76] to the effect that the reaction of the mind to\r\nthe attacking stimuli in sleep is determined by the formation of\r\nillusions. A sensory impression is recognised by us and correctly\r\ninterpreted, i.e. it is classed with the memory group to which it\r\nbelongs according to all previous experience, if the impression is\r\nstrong, clear, and long enough, and if we have the necessary time at our\r\ndisposal for this reflection. If these conditions are not fulfilled, we\r\nmistake the objects which give rise to the impression, and on its basis\r\nwe form an illusion. \xe2\x80\x9cIf one takes a walk in an open field and perceives\r\nindistinctly a distant object, it may happen that he will at first take\r\nit for a horse.\xe2\x80\x9d On closer inspection the image of a cow resting may\r\nobtrude itself, and the presentation may finally resolve itself with\r\ncertainty into a group of people sitting. The impressions which the mind\r\nreceives during sleep through outer stimuli are of a similar indistinct\r\nnature; they give rise to illusions because the impression evokes a\r\ngreater or lesser number of memory pictures through which the impression\r\nreceives its psychic value. In which of the many spheres of memory to be\r\ntaken into consideration the corresponding pictures are aroused, and\r\nwhich of the possible association connections thereby come into force,\r\nthis, even according to Str\xc3\xbcmpell, remains indeterminable, and is left,\r\nas it were, to the caprice of the psychic life.\r\n\r\nWe may here take our choice. We may admit that the laws of the dream\r\nformation cannot really be traced any further, and therefore refrain\r\nfrom asking whether or not the interpretation of the illusion evoked by\r\nthe sensory impression depends upon still other conditions; or we may\r\nsuppose that the objective sensory stimulus encroaching upon sleep plays\r\nonly a modest part as a dream source, and that other factors determine\r\nthe choice of the memory picture to be evoked. Indeed, on carefully\r\nexamining Maury\xe2\x80\x99s experimentally produced dreams, which I have purposely\r\nreported in detail, one is apt to think that the experiment really\r\nexplains the origin of only one of the dream elements, and that the rest\r\nof the dream content appears in fact too independent, too much\r\ndetermined in detail, to be explained by the one demand, viz. that it\r\nmust agree with the element experimentally introduced. Indeed one even\r\nbegins to doubt the illusion theory, and the power of the objective\r\nimpression to form the dream, when one learns that this impression at\r\ntimes experiences the most peculiar and far-fetched interpretations\r\nduring the sleeping state. Thus B. M. Simon[63] tells of a dream in\r\nwhich he saw persons of gigantic stature[H] seated at a table, and heard\r\ndistinctly the awful rattling produced by the impact of their jaws while\r\nchewing. On waking he heard the clacking of the hoofs of a horse\r\ngalloping past his window. If the noise of the horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoofs had\r\nrecalled ideas from the memory sphere of \xe2\x80\x9cGulliver\xe2\x80\x99s Travels,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nsojourn with the giants of Brobdingnag and the virtuous\r\nhorse-creatures\xe2\x80\x94as I should perhaps interpret it without any assistance\r\non the author\xe2\x80\x99s part\xe2\x80\x94should not the choice of a memory sphere so\r\nuncommon for the stimulus have some further illumination from other\r\nmotives?\r\n\r\nII. _Internal (Subjective) Sensory Stimuli._\xe2\x80\x94Notwithstanding all\r\nobjections to the contrary, we must admit that the r\xc3\xb4le of the objective\r\nsensory stimuli as a producer of dreams has been indisputably\r\nestablished, and if these stimuli seem perhaps insufficient in their\r\nnature and frequency to explain all dream pictures, we are then directed\r\nto look for other dream sources acting in an analogous manner. I do not\r\nknow where the idea originated that along with the outer sensory stimuli\r\nthe inner (subjective) stimuli should also be considered, but as a\r\nmatter of fact this is done more or less fully in all the more recent\r\ndescriptions of the etiology of dreams. \xe2\x80\x9cAn important part is played in\r\ndream illusions,\xe2\x80\x9d says Wundt[36] (p. 363), \xe2\x80\x9cby those subjective\r\nsensations of seeing and hearing which are familiar to us in the waking\r\nstate as a luminous chaos in the dark field of vision, ringing, buzzing,\r\n&c., of the ears, and especially irritation of the retina. This explains\r\nthe remarkable tendency of the dream to delude the eyes with numbers of\r\nsimilar or identical objects. Thus we see spread before our eyes\r\nnumberless birds, butterflies, fishes, coloured beads, flowers, &c. Here\r\nthe luminous dust in the dark field of vision has taken on phantastic\r\nfigures, and the many luminous points of which it consists are embodied\r\nby the dream in as many single pictures, which are looked upon as moving\r\nobjects owing to the mobility of the luminous chaos. This is also the\r\nroot of the great fondness of the dream for the most complex animal\r\nfigures, the multiplicity of forms readily following the form of the\r\nsubjective light pictures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe subjective sensory stimuli as a source of the dream have the obvious\r\nadvantage that unlike the objective stimuli they are independent of\r\nexternal accidents. They are, so to speak, at the disposal of the\r\nexplanation as often as it needs them. They are, however, in so far\r\ninferior to the objective sensory stimuli that the r\xc3\xb4le of dream\r\ninciter, which observation and experiment have proven for the latter,\r\ncan be verified in their case only with difficulty or not at all. The\r\nmain proof for the dream-inciting power of subjective sensory\r\nexcitements is offered by the so-called hypnogogic hallucinations, which\r\nhave been described by John M\xc3\xbcller as \xe2\x80\x9cphantastic visual\r\nmanifestations.\xe2\x80\x9d They are those very vivid and changeable pictures which\r\noccur regularly in many people during the period of falling asleep, and\r\nwhich may remain for awhile even after the eyes have been opened.\r\nMaury,[48] who was considerably troubled by them, subjected them to a\r\nthorough study, and maintained that they are related to or rather\r\nidentical with dream pictures\xe2\x80\x94this has already been asserted by John\r\nM\xc3\xbcller. Maury states that a certain psychic passivity is necessary for\r\ntheir origin; it requires a relaxation of the tension of attention (p.\r\n59). But in any ordinary disposition a hypnogogic hallucination may be\r\nproduced by merging for a second into such lethargy, after which one\r\nperhaps awakens until this oft-repeated process terminates in sleep.\r\nAccording to Maury, if one awakens shortly thereafter, it is often\r\npossible to demonstrate the same pictures in the dream which one has\r\nperceived as hypnogogic hallucinations before falling asleep (p. 134).\r\nThus it once happened to Maury with a group of pictures of grotesque\r\nfigures, with distorted features and strange headdresses, which obtruded\r\nthemselves upon him with incredible importunity during the period of\r\nfalling asleep, and which he recalled having dreamed upon awakening. On\r\nanother occasion, while suffering from hunger, because he kept himself\r\non a rather strict diet, he saw hypnogogically a plate and a hand armed\r\nwith a fork taking some food from the plate. In his dream he found\r\nhimself at a table abundantly supplied with food, and heard the rattle\r\nmade by the diners with their forks. On still another occasion, after\r\nfalling asleep with irritated and painful eyes, he had the hypnogogic\r\nhallucination of seeing microscopically small characters which he was\r\nforced to decipher one by one with great exertion; having been awakened\r\nfrom his sleep an hour later, he recalled a dream in which there was an\r\nopen book with very small letters, which he was obliged to read through\r\nwith laborious effort.\r\n\r\nJust as in the case of these pictures, auditory hallucinations of words,\r\nnames, &c., may also appear hypnogogically, and then repeat themselves\r\nin the dream, like an overture announcing the principal motive of the\r\nopera which is to follow.\r\n\r\nA more recent observer of hypnogogic hallucinations, G. Trumbull\r\nLadd,[40] takes the same path pursued by John M\xc3\xbcller and Maury. By dint\r\nof practice he succeeded in acquiring the faculty of suddenly arousing\r\nhimself, without opening his eyes, two to five minutes after having\r\ngradually fallen asleep, which gave him opportunity to compare the\r\nsensations of the retina just vanishing with the dream pictures\r\nremaining in his memory. He assures us that an intimate relation between\r\nthe two can always be recognised, in the sense that the luminous dots\r\nand lines of the spontaneous light of the retina produced, so to speak,\r\nthe sketched outline or scheme for the psychically perceived dream\r\nfigures. A dream, _e.g._, in which he saw in front of him clearly\r\nprinted lines which he read and studied, corresponded to an arrangement\r\nof the luminous dots and lines in the retina in parallel lines, or, to\r\nexpress it in his own words: \xe2\x80\x9cThe clearly printed page, which he was\r\nreading in the dream, resolved itself into an object which appeared to\r\nhis waking perception like part of an actual printed sheet looked at\r\nthrough a little hole in a piece of paper, from too great a distance to\r\nbe made out distinctly.\xe2\x80\x9d Without in any way under-estimating the central\r\npart of the phenomenon, Ladd believes that hardly any visual dream\r\noccurs in our minds that is not based on material furnished by this\r\ninner condition of stimulation in the retina. This is particularly true\r\nof dreams occurring shortly after falling asleep in a dark room, while\r\ndreams occurring in the morning near the period of awakening receive\r\ntheir stimulation from the objective light penetrating the eye from the\r\nlightened room. The shifting and endlessly variable character of the\r\nspontaneous luminous excitation of the retina corresponds exactly to the\r\nfitful succession of pictures presented to us in our dreams. If we\r\nattach any importance to Ladd\xe2\x80\x99s observations, we cannot underrate the\r\nproductiveness of this subjective source of excitation for the dream;\r\nfor visual pictures apparently form the principal constituent of our\r\ndreams. The share furnished from the spheres of the other senses, beside\r\nthe sense of hearing, is more insignificant and inconstant.\r\n\r\nIII. _Internal (Organic) Physical Excitation._\xe2\x80\x94If we are disposed to\r\nseek dream sources not outside, but inside, the organism, we must\r\nremember that almost all our internal organs, which in their healthy\r\nstate hardly remind us of their existence, may, in states of\r\nexcitation\xe2\x80\x94as we call them\xe2\x80\x94or in disease, become for us a source of the\r\nmost painful sensations, which must be put on an equality with the\r\nexternal excitants of the pain and sensory stimuli. It is on the\r\nstrength of very old experience that, _e.g._, Str\xc3\xbcmpell[66] declares\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cduring sleep the mind becomes far more deeply and broadly\r\nconscious of its connection with the body than in the waking state, and\r\nit is compelled to receive and be influenced by stimulating impressions\r\noriginating in parts and changes of the body of which it is unconscious\r\nin the waking state.\xe2\x80\x9d Even Aristotle[1] declares it quite possible that\r\nthe dream should draw our attention to incipient morbid conditions which\r\nwe have not noticed at all in the waking state owing to the exaggeration\r\ngiven by the dream to the impressions; and some medical authors, who\r\nwere certainly far from believing in any prophetic power of the dream,\r\nhave admitted this significance of the dream at least for the\r\nforetelling of disease. (Compare M. Simon, p. 31, and many older\r\nauthors.)\r\n\r\nEven in our times there seems to be no lack of authenticated examples of\r\nsuch diagnostic performances on the part of the dream. Thus Tissi\xc3\xa9[68]\r\ncites from Artigues (_Essai sur la Valeur s\xc3\xa9m\xc3\xa9iologique des R\xc3\xa9ves_), the\r\nhistory of a woman of forty-three years, who, during several years of\r\napparently perfect health, was troubled with anxiety dreams, and in whom\r\nmedical examination later disclosed an incipient affection of the heart\r\nto which she soon succumbed.\r\n\r\nSerious disturbances of the internal organs apparently act as inciters\r\nof dreams in a considerable number of persons. Attention is quite\r\ngenerally called to the frequency of anxiety dreams in the diseases of\r\nthe heart and lungs; indeed this relation of the dream life is placed so\r\nconspicuously in the foreground by many authors that I shall here\r\ncontent myself with a mere reference to the literature. (Radestock,[54]\r\nSpitta,[64] Maury, M. Simon, Tissi\xc3\xa9.) Tissi\xc3\xa9 even assumes that the\r\ndiseased organs impress upon the dream content their characteristic\r\nfeatures. The dreams of persons suffering from diseases of the heart are\r\ngenerally very brief and terminate in a terrified awakening; the\r\nsituation of death under terrible circumstances almost always plays a\r\npart in their content. Those suffering from diseases of the lungs dream\r\nof suffocation, of being crowded, and of flight, and a great many of\r\nthem are subject to the well-known nightmare, which, by the way, Boerner\r\nhas succeeded in producing experimentally by lying on the face and\r\nclosing up the openings of the respiratory organs. In digestive\r\ndisturbances the dream contains ideas from the sphere of enjoyment and\r\ndisgust. Finally, the influence of sexual excitement on the dream\r\ncontent is perceptible enough in every one\xe2\x80\x99s experience, and lends the\r\nstrongest support to the entire theory of the dream excitation through\r\norganic sensation.\r\n\r\nMoreover, as we go through the literature of the dream, it becomes quite\r\nobvious that some of the authors (Maury,[48] Weygandt[75]) have been led\r\nto the study of dream problems by the influence of their own\r\npathological state on the content of their dreams.\r\n\r\nThe addition to dream sources from these undoubtedly established facts\r\nis, however, not as important as one might be led to suppose; for the\r\ndream is a phenomenon which occurs in healthy persons\xe2\x80\x94perhaps in all\r\npersons, and every night\xe2\x80\x94and a pathological state of the organs is\r\napparently not one of its indispensable conditions. For us, however, the\r\nquestion is not whence particular dreams originate, but what may be the\r\nexciting source for the ordinary dreams of normal persons.\r\n\r\nBut we need go only a step further to find a dream source which is more\r\nprolific than any of those mentioned above, which indeed promises to be\r\ninexhaustible in every case. If it is established that the bodily organs\r\nbecome in sickness an exciting source of dreams, and if we admit that\r\nthe mind, diverted during sleep from the outer world, can devote more\r\nattention to the interior of the body, we may readily assume that the\r\norgans need not necessarily become diseased in order to permit stimuli,\r\nwhich in some way or other grow into dream pictures, to reach the\r\nsleeping mind. What in the waking state we broadly perceive as general\r\nsensation, distinguishable by its quality alone, to which, in the\r\nopinion of the physicians, all the organic systems contribute their\r\nshares\xe2\x80\x94this general sensation at night attaining powerful efficiency and\r\nbecoming active with its individual components\xe2\x80\x94would naturally furnish\r\nthe most powerful as well as the most common source for the production\r\nof the dream presentations. It still remains, however, to examine\r\naccording to what rule the organic sensations become transformed into\r\ndream presentations.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the origin of dreams just stated has been the favourite\r\nwith all medical authors. The obscurity which conceals the essence of\r\nour being\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9c_moi splanchnique_,\xe2\x80\x9d as Tissi\xc3\xa9 terms it\xe2\x80\x94from our\r\nknowledge and the obscurity of the origin of the dream correspond too\r\nwell not to be brought into relation with each other. The train of\r\nthought which makes organic sensation the inciter of the dream has\r\nbesides another attraction for the physician, inasmuch as it favours the\r\netiological union of the dream and mental diseases, which show so many\r\nagreements in their manifestations, for alterations in the organic\r\nsensations and excitations emanating from the inner organs are both of\r\nwide significance in the origin of the psychoses. It is therefore not\r\nsurprising that the theory of bodily sensation can be traced to more\r\nthan one originator who has propounded it independently.\r\n\r\nA number of authors have been influenced by the train of ideas developed\r\nby the philosopher Schopenhauer in 1851. Our conception of the universe\r\noriginates through the fact that our intellect recasts the impressions\r\ncoming to it from without in the moulds of time, space, and causality.\r\nThe sensations from the interior of the organism, proceeding from the\r\nsympathetic nervous system, exert in the day-time an influence on our\r\nmood for the most part unconscious. At night, however, when the\r\noverwhelming influence of the day\xe2\x80\x99s impressions is no longer felt, the\r\nimpressions pressing upward from the interior are able to gain\r\nattention\xe2\x80\x94just as in the night we hear the rippling of the spring that\r\nwas rendered inaudible by the noise of the day. In what other way, then,\r\ncould the intellect react upon these stimuli than by performing its\r\ncharacteristic function? It will transform the stimuli into figures,\r\nfilling space and time, which move at the beginning of causality; and\r\nthus the dream originates. Scherner,[58] and after him Volkelt,[72]\r\nattempted to penetrate into closer relations between physical sensations\r\nand dream pictures; but we shall reserve the discussion of these\r\nattempts for the chapter on the theory of the dream.\r\n\r\nIn a study particularly logical in its development, the psychiatrist\r\nKrauss[39] found the origin of the dream as well as of deliria and\r\ndelusions in the same element, viz. the organically determined\r\nsensation. According to this author there is hardly a place in the\r\norganism which might not become the starting point of a dream or of a\r\ndelusion. Now organically determined sensations \xe2\x80\x9cmay be divided into two\r\nclasses: (1) those of the total feeling (general sensations), (2)\r\nspecific sensations which are inherent in the principal systems of the\r\nvegetative organism, which may be divided into five groups: (_a_) the\r\nmuscular, (_b_) the pneumatic, (_c_) the gastric, (_d_) the sexual,\r\n(_e_) the peripheral sensations (p. 33 of the second article).\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe origin of the dream picture on the basis of the physical sensations\r\nis conceived by Krauss as follows: The awakened sensation evokes a\r\npresentation related to it in accordance with some law of association,\r\nand combines with this, thus forming an organic structure, towards\r\nwhich, however, consciousness does not maintain its normal attitude. For\r\nit does not bestow any attention on the sensation itself, but concerns\r\nitself entirely with the accompanying presentation; this is likewise the\r\nreason why the state of affairs in question should have been so long\r\nmisunderstood (p. 11, &c.). Krauss finds for this process the specific\r\nterm of \xe2\x80\x9ctransubstantiation of the feeling into dream pictures\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 24).\r\n\r\nThat the organic bodily sensations exert some influence on the formation\r\nof the dream is nowadays almost universally acknowledged, but the\r\nquestion as to the law underlying the relation between the two is\r\nanswered in various ways and often in obscure terms. On the basis of the\r\ntheory of bodily excitation the special task of dream interpretation is\r\nto trace back the content of a dream to the causative organic stimulus,\r\nand if we do not recognise the rules of interpretation advanced by\r\nScherner,[58] we frequently find ourselves confronted with the awkward\r\nfact that the organic exciting source reveals itself in the content of\r\nthe dream only.\r\n\r\nA certain agreement, however, is manifested in the interpretation of the\r\nvarious forms of dreams which have been designated as \xe2\x80\x9ctypical\xe2\x80\x9d because\r\nthey recur in so many persons with almost the same contents. Among these\r\nare the well-known dreams of falling from heights, of the falling out of\r\nteeth, of flying, and of embarrassment because of being naked or barely\r\nclad. This last dream is said to be caused simply by the perception felt\r\nin sleep that one has thrown off the bedcover and is exposed. The dream\r\nof the falling out of teeth is explained by \xe2\x80\x9cdental irritation,\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\ndoes not, however, of necessity imply a morbid state of excitation in\r\nthe teeth. According to Str\xc3\xbcmpell,[66] the flying dream is the adequate\r\npicture used by the mind to interpret the sum of excitation emanating\r\nfrom the rising and sinking of the pulmonary lobes after the cutaneous\r\nsensation of the thorax has been reduced to insensibility. It is this\r\nlatter circumstance that causes a sensation related to the conception of\r\nflying. Falling from a height in a dream is said to have its cause in\r\nthe fact that when unconsciousness of the sensation of cutaneous\r\npressure has set in, either an arm falls away from the body or a flexed\r\nknee is suddenly stretched out, causing the feeling of cutaneous\r\npressure to return to consciousness, and the transition to consciousness\r\nembodies itself psychically as a dream of falling. (Str\xc3\xbcmpell, p. 118).\r\nThe weakness of these plausible attempts at explanation evidently lies\r\nin the fact that without any further elucidation they allow this or that\r\ngroup of organic sensations to disappear from psychic perception or to\r\nobtrude themselves upon it until the constellation favourable for the\r\nexplanation has been established. I shall, however, later have occasion\r\nto recur to typical dreams and to their origin.\r\n\r\nFrom comparison of a series of similar dreams, M. Simon[63] endeavoured\r\nto formulate certain rules for the influence of the organic sensations\r\non the determination of the resulting dream. He says (p. 34): \xe2\x80\x9cIf any\r\norganic apparatus, which during sleep normally participates in the\r\nexpression of an affect, for any reason merges into the state of\r\nexcitation to which it is usually aroused by that affect, the dream thus\r\nproduced will contain presentations which fit the affect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother rule reads as follows (p. 35): \xe2\x80\x9cIf an organic apparatus is in a\r\nstate of activity, excitation, or disturbance during sleep, the dream\r\nwill bring ideas which are related to the exercise of the organic\r\nfunction which is performed by that apparatus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMourly Vold[73] has undertaken to prove experimentally the influence\r\nassumed by the theory of bodily sensation for a single territory. He has\r\nmade experiments in altering the positions of the sleeper\xe2\x80\x99s limbs, and\r\nhas compared the resulting dream with his alterations. As a result he\r\nreports the following theories:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n1. The position of a limb in a dream corresponds approximately to that\r\nof reality, _i.e._ we dream of a static condition of the limb which\r\ncorresponds to the real condition.\r\n\r\n2. When one dreams of a moving limb it always happens that one of the\r\npositions occurring in the execution of this movement corresponds to the\r\nreal position.\r\n\r\n3. The position of one\xe2\x80\x99s own limb may be attributed in the dream to\r\nanother person.\r\n\r\n4. One may dream further that the movement in question is impeded.\r\n\r\n5. The limb in any particular position may appear in the dream as an\r\nanimal or monster, in which case a certain analogy between the two is\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n6. The position of a limb may incite in the dream ideas which bear some\r\nrelation or other to this limb. Thus, _e.g._, if we are employed with\r\nthe fingers we dream of numerals.\r\n\r\nSuch results would lead me to conclude that even the theory of bodily\r\nsensation cannot fully extinguish the apparent freedom in the\r\ndetermination of the dream picture to be awakened.[I]\r\n\r\nIV. _Psychic Exciting Sources._\xe2\x80\x94In treating the relations of the dream\r\nto the waking life and the origin of the dream material, we learned that\r\nthe earliest as well as the latest investigators agreed that men dream\r\nof what they are doing in the day-time, and of what they are interested\r\nin during the waking state. This interest continuing from waking life\r\ninto sleep, besides being a psychic tie joining the dream to life, also\r\nfurnishes us a dream source not to be under-estimated, which, taken with\r\nthose stimuli which become interesting and active during sleep, suffices\r\nto explain the origin of all dream pictures. But we have also heard the\r\nopposite of the above assertion, viz. that the dream takes the sleeper\r\naway from the interests of the day, and that in most cases we do not\r\ndream of things that have occupied our attention during the day until\r\nafter they have lost for the waking life the stimulus of actuality.\r\nHence in the analysis of the dream life we are reminded at every step\r\nthat it is inadmissible to frame general rules without making provision\r\nfor qualifications expressed by such terms as \xe2\x80\x9cfrequently,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cas a rule,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cin most cases,\xe2\x80\x9d and without preparing for the validity of the\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\nIf the conscious interest, together with the inner and outer sleep\r\nstimuli, sufficed to cover the etiology of the dreams, we ought to be in\r\na position to give a satisfactory account of the origin of all the\r\nelements of a dream; the riddle of the dream sources would thus be\r\nsolved, leaving only the task of separating the part played by the\r\npsychic and the somatic dream stimuli in individual dreams. But as a\r\nmatter of fact no such complete solution of a dream has ever been\r\naccomplished in any case, and, what is more, every one attempting such\r\nsolution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many\r\ncomponents of the dream, the source of which he was unable to explain.\r\nThe daily interest as a psychic source of dreams is evidently not\r\nfar-reaching enough to justify the confident assertions to the effect\r\nthat we all continue our waking affairs in the dream.\r\n\r\nOther psychic sources of dreams are unknown. Hence, with the exception\r\nperhaps of the explanation of dreams given by Scherner,[58] which will\r\nbe referred to later, all explanations found in the literature show a\r\nlarge gap when we come to the derivation of the material for the\r\npresentation pictures, which is most characteristic for the dream. In\r\nthis dilemma the majority of authors have developed a tendency to\r\ndepreciate as much as possible the psychic factor in the excitations of\r\ndreams which is so difficult to approach. To be sure, they distinguish\r\nas a main division of dreams the nerve-exciting and the association\r\ndreams, and assert that the latter has its source exclusively in\r\nreproduction (Wundt,[76] p. 365), but they cannot yet dismiss the doubt\r\nwhether \xe2\x80\x9cthey do not appear without being impelled by the psychical\r\nstimulus\xe2\x80\x9d (Volkelt,[72] p. 127). The characteristic quality of the pure\r\nassociation dream is also found wanting. To quote Volkelt (p. 118): \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nthe association dreams proper we can no longer speak of such a firm\r\nnucleus. Here the loose grouping penetrates also into the centre of the\r\ndream. The ideation which is already set free from reason and intellect\r\nis here no longer held together by the more important psychical and\r\nmental stimuli, but is left to its own aimless shifting and complete\r\nconfusion.\xe2\x80\x9d Wundt, too, attempts to depreciate the psychic factor in the\r\nstimulation of dreams by declaring that the \xe2\x80\x9cphantasms of the dream\r\ncertainly are unjustly regarded as pure hallucinations, and that\r\nprobably most dream presentations are really illusions, inasmuch as they\r\nemanate from slight sensory impressions which are never extinguished\r\nduring sleep\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 338, &c.). Weygandt[75] agrees with this view, but\r\ngeneralises it. He asserts that \xe2\x80\x9cthe first source of all dream\r\npresentations is a sensory stimulus to which reproductive associations\r\nare then joined\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 17). Tissi\xc3\xa9[68] goes still further in repressing\r\nthe psychic exciting sources (p. 183): \xe2\x80\x9cLes r\xc3\xaaves d\xe2\x80\x99origine absolument\r\npsychique n\xe2\x80\x99existent pas\xe2\x80\x9d; and elsewhere (p. 6), \xe2\x80\x9cLes pens\xc3\xa9es de nos\r\nr\xc3\xaaves nous viennent de dehors....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose authors who, like the influential philosopher Wundt, adopt a\r\nmiddle course do not fail to remark that in most dreams there is a\r\nco-operation of the somatic stimuli with the psychic instigators of the\r\ndream, the latter being either unknown or recognised as day interests.\r\n\r\nWe shall learn later that the riddle of the dream formation can be\r\nsolved by the disclosure of an unsuspected psychic source of excitement.\r\nFor the present we shall not be surprised at the over-estimation of\r\nthose stimuli for the formation of the dream which do not originate from\r\npsychic life. It is not merely because they alone can easily be found\r\nand even confirmed by experiment, but the somatic conception of the\r\norigin of dreams thoroughly corresponds to the mode of thinking in vogue\r\nnowadays in psychiatry. Indeed, the mastery of the brain over the\r\norganism is particularly emphasized; but everything that might prove an\r\nindependence of the psychic life from the demonstrable organic changes,\r\nor a spontaneity in its manifestations, is alarming to the psychiatrist\r\nnowadays, as if an acknowledgment of the same were bound to bring back\r\nthe times of natural philosophy and the metaphysical conception of the\r\npsychic essence. The distrust of the psychiatrist has placed the psyche\r\nunder a guardian, so to speak, and now demands that none of its feelings\r\nshall divulge any of its own faculties; but this attitude shows slight\r\nconfidence in the stability of the causal concatenation which extends\r\nbetween the material and the psychic. Even where on investigation the\r\npsychic can be recognised as the primary course of a phenomenon, a more\r\nprofound penetration will some day succeed in finding a continuation of\r\nthe path to the organic determination of the psychic. But where the\r\npsychic must be taken as the terminus for our present knowledge, it\r\nshould not be denied on that account.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Why the Dream is Forgotten after Awakening._\xe2\x80\x94That the dream\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfades away\xe2\x80\x9d in the morning is proverbial. To be sure, it is capable of\r\nrecollection. For we know the dream only by recalling it after\r\nawakening; but very often we believe that we remember it only\r\nincompletely, and that during the night there was more of it; we can\r\nobserve how the memory of a dream which has been still vivid in the\r\nmorning vanishes in the course of the day, leaving only a few small\r\nfragments; we often know that we have been dreaming, but we do not know\r\nwhat; and we are so well used to the fact that the dream is liable to be\r\nforgotten that we do not reject as absurd the possibility that one may\r\nhave been dreaming even when one knows nothing in the morning of either\r\nthe contents or the fact of dreaming. On the other hand, it happens that\r\ndreams manifest an extraordinary retentiveness in the memory. I have had\r\noccasion to analyse with my patients dreams which had occurred to them\r\ntwenty-five years or more previously, and I can remember a dream of my\r\nown which is separated from the present day by at least thirty-seven\r\nyears, and yet has lost nothing of its freshness in my memory. All this\r\nis very remarkable, and for the present incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nThe forgetting of dreams is treated in the most detailed manner by\r\nStr\xc3\xbcmpell.[66] This forgetting is evidently a complex phenomenon; for\r\nStr\xc3\xbcmpell does not explain it by a single reason, but by a considerable\r\nnumber of reasons.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, all those factors which produce forgetfulness in the\r\nwaking state are also determinant for the forgetting of dreams. When\r\nawake we are wont soon to forget a large number of sensations and\r\nperceptions because they are too feeble, and because they are connected\r\nwith a slight amount of emotional feeling. This is also the case with\r\nmany dream pictures; they are forgotten because they are too weak, while\r\nstronger pictures in proximity will be remembered. Moreover, the factor\r\nof intensity in itself is not the only determinant for the preservation\r\nof the dream pictures; Str\xc3\xbcmpell, as well as other authors (Calkins),\r\nadmits that dream pictures are often rapidly forgotten, although they\r\nare known to have been vivid, whereas among those that are retained in\r\nmemory there are many that are very shadowy and hazy. Besides, in the\r\nwaking state one is wont to forget easily what happened only once, and\r\nto note more easily things of repeated occurrence. But most dream\r\npictures are single experiences,[J] and this peculiarity equally\r\ncontributes towards the forgetting of all dreams. Of greater\r\nsignificance is a third motive for forgetting. In order that feelings,\r\npresentations, thoughts and the like, should attain a certain degree of\r\nmemory, it is important that they should not remain isolated, but that\r\nthey should enter into connections and associations of a suitable kind.\r\nIf the words of a short verse are taken and mixed together, it will be\r\nvery difficult to remember them. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen well arranged in suitable\r\nsequence one word will help another, and the whole remains as sense\r\neasily and firmly in the memory for a long time. Contradictions we\r\nusually retain with just as much difficulty and rarity as things\r\nconfused and disarranged.\xe2\x80\x9d Now dreams in most cases lack sense and\r\norder. Dream compositions are by their very nature incapable of being\r\nremembered, and they are forgotten because they usually crumble together\r\nthe very next moment. To be sure, these conclusions are not in full\r\naccord with the observation of Radestock[54] (p. 168), that we retain\r\nbest just those dreams which are most peculiar.\r\n\r\nAccording to Str\xc3\xbcmpell, there are still other factors effective in the\r\nforgetting of dreams which are derived from the relation of the dream to\r\nthe waking state. The forgetfulness of the waking consciousness for\r\ndreams is evidently only the counterpart of the fact already mentioned,\r\nthat the dream (almost) never takes over successive memories from the\r\nwaking state, but only certain details of these memories which it tears\r\naway from the habitual psychic connections in which they are recalled\r\nwhile we are awake. The dream composition, therefore, has no place in\r\nthe company of psychic successions which fill the mind. It lacks all the\r\naids of memory. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this manner the dream structure rises, as it were,\r\nfrom the soil of our psychic life, and floats in psychic space like a\r\ncloud in the sky, which the next breath of air soon dispels\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 87).\r\nThis is also aided by the fact that, upon awakening, the attention is\r\nimmediately seized by the inrushing sensory world, and only very few\r\ndream pictures can withstand this power. They fade away before the\r\nimpressions of the new day like the glow of the stars before the\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\nAs a last factor favouring the forgetting of dreams, we may mention the\r\nfact that most people generally take little interest in their dreams.\r\nOne who investigates dreams for a time, and takes a special interest in\r\nthem, usually dreams more during that time than at any other; that is,\r\nhe remembers his dreams more easily and more frequently.\r\n\r\nTwo other reasons for the forgetting of dreams added by Bonatelli (given\r\nby Benini[3]) to those of Str\xc3\xbcmpell have already been included in the\r\nlatter; namely, (1) that the change of the general feeling between the\r\nsleeping and waking states is unfavourable to the mutual reproductions,\r\nand (2) that the different arrangement of the presentation material in\r\nthe dream makes the dream untranslatable, so to speak, for the waking\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nIt is the more remarkable, as Str\xc3\xbcmpell observes, that, in spite of all\r\nthese reasons for forgetting the dream, so many dreams are retained in\r\nmemory. The continued efforts of the authors to formulate laws for the\r\nremembering of dreams amounts to an admission that here too there is\r\nsomething puzzling and unsolved. Certain peculiarities relating to the\r\nmemory of dreams have been particularly noticed of late, _e.g._, that a\r\ndream which is considered forgotten in the morning may be recalled in\r\nthe course of the day through a perception which accidentally touches\r\nthe forgotten content of the dream (Radestock,[54] Tissi\xc3\xa9[68]). The\r\nentire memory of the dream is open to an objection calculated to\r\ndepreciate its value very markedly in critical eyes. One may doubt\r\nwhether our memory, which omits so much from the dream, does not falsify\r\nwhat it retained.\r\n\r\nSuch doubts relating to the exactness of the reproduction of the dream\r\nare expressed by Str\xc3\xbcmpell when he says: \xe2\x80\x9cIt therefore easily happens\r\nthat the active consciousness involuntarily inserts much in recollection\r\nof the dream; one imagines one has dreamt all sorts of things which the\r\nactual dream did not contain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJessen[36] (p. 547) expresses himself very decidedly: \xe2\x80\x9cMoreover we must\r\nnot lose sight of the fact, hitherto little heeded, that in the\r\ninvestigation and interpretation of orderly and logical dreams we almost\r\nalways play with the truth when we recall a dream to memory.\r\nUnconsciously and unwittingly we fill up the gaps and supplement the\r\ndream pictures. Rarely, and perhaps never, has a connected dream been as\r\nconnected as it appears to us in memory. Even the most truth-loving\r\nperson can hardly relate a dream without exaggerating and embellishing\r\nit. The tendency of the human mind to conceive everything in connection\r\nis so great that it unwittingly supplies the deficiencies of connection\r\nif the dream is recalled somewhat disconnectedly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe observations of V. Eggers,[20] though surely independently\r\nconceived, sound almost like a translation of Jessen\xe2\x80\x99s words: \xe2\x80\x9c...\r\nL\xe2\x80\x99observation des r\xc3\xaaves a ses difficult\xc3\xa9s sp\xc3\xa9ciales et le seul moyen\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9viter toute erreur en pareille mati\xc3\xa8re est de confier au papier sans\r\nle moindre retard ce que l\xe2\x80\x99on vient d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9prouver et de remarquer; sinon,\r\nl\xe2\x80\x99oubli vient vite ou total ou partiel; l\xe2\x80\x99oubli total est sans gravit\xc3\xa9;\r\nmais l\xe2\x80\x99oubli partiel est perfide; car si l\xe2\x80\x99on se met ensuite \xc3\xa0 raconter\r\nce que l\xe2\x80\x99on n\xe2\x80\x99a pas oubli\xc3\xa9, on est expos\xc3\xa9 \xc3\xa0 compl\xc3\xa9ter par imagination\r\nles fragments incoh\xc3\xa9rents et disjoints fourni par la m\xc3\xa9moire ...; on\r\ndevient artiste \xc3\xa0 son insu, et le r\xc3\xa9cit, p\xc3\xa9riodiquement r\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 s\xe2\x80\x99impose\r\n\xc3\xa0 la cr\xc3\xa9ance de son auteur, qui, de bonne foi, le pr\xc3\xa9sente comme un fait\r\nauthentique, d\xc3\xbbment \xc3\xa9tabli selon les bonnes m\xc3\xa9thodes....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSimilarly Spitta,[64] who seems to think that it is only in our attempt\r\nto reproduce the dream that we put in order the loosely associated dream\r\nelements: \xe2\x80\x9cTo make connection out of disconnection, that is, to add the\r\nprocess of logical connection which is absent in the dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs we do not at present possess any other objective control for the\r\nreliability of our memory, and as indeed such a control is impossible in\r\nexamining the dream which is our own experience, and for which our\r\nmemory is the only source, it is a question what value we may attach to\r\nour recollections of dreams.\r\n\r\n(_e_) _The Psychological Peculiarities of Dreams._\xe2\x80\x94In the scientific\r\ninvestigation of the dream we start with the assumption that the dream\r\nis an occurrence of our own psychic activity; nevertheless the finished\r\ndream appears to us as something strange, the authorship of which we are\r\nso little forced to recognise that we can just as easily say \xe2\x80\x9ca dream\r\nappeared to me,\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cI have dreamt.\xe2\x80\x9d Whence this \xe2\x80\x9cpsychic strangeness\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nof the dream? According to our discussion of the sources of dreams we\r\nmay suppose that it does not depend on the material reaching the dream\r\ncontent; because this is for the most part common to the dream life and\r\nwaking life. One may ask whether in the dream it is not changes in the\r\npsychic processes which call forth this impression, and may so put to\r\ntest a psychological characteristic of the dream.\r\n\r\nNo one has more strongly emphasized the essential difference between\r\ndream and waking life, and utilised this difference for more\r\nfar-reaching conclusions, than G. Th. Fechner[25] in some observations\r\nin his _Elements of Psychophysic_ (p. 520, part 11). He believes that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cneither the simple depression of conscious psychic life under the main\r\nthreshold,\xe2\x80\x9d nor the distraction of attention from the influences of the\r\nouter world, suffices to explain the peculiarities of the dream life as\r\ncompared with the waking life. He rather believes that the scene of\r\ndreams is laid elsewhere than in the waking presentation life. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the\r\nscene of the psychophysical activity were the same during the sleeping\r\nand the waking states, the dream, in my opinion, could only be a\r\ncontinuation of the waking ideation maintaining itself at a lower degree\r\nof intensity, and must moreover share with the latter its material and\r\nform. But the state of affairs is quite different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat Fechner really meant has never been made clear, nor has anybody\r\nelse, to my knowledge, followed further the road, the clue to which he\r\nindicated in this remark. An anatomical interpretation in the sense of\r\nphysiological brain localisations, or even in reference to histological\r\nsections of the cerebral cortex, will surely have to be excluded. The\r\nthought may, however, prove ingenious and fruitful if it can be referred\r\nto a psychic apparatus which is constructed out of many instances placed\r\none behind another.\r\n\r\nOther authors have been content to render prominent one or another of\r\nthe tangible psychological peculiarities of the dream life, and perhaps\r\nto take these as a starting point for more far-reaching attempts at\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nIt has been justly remarked that one of the main peculiarities of the\r\ndream life appears even in the state of falling asleep, and is to be\r\ndesignated as the phenomenon inducing sleep. According to\r\nSchleiermacher[61] (p. 351), the characteristic part of the waking state\r\nis the fact that the psychic activity occurs in ideas rather than in\r\npictures. But the dream thinks in pictures, and one may observe that\r\nwith the approach of sleep the voluntary activities become difficult in\r\nthe same measure as the involuntary appear, the latter belonging wholly\r\nto the class of pictures. The inability for such presentation work as we\r\nperceive to be intentionally desired, and the appearance of pictures\r\nwhich is regularly connected with this distraction, these are two\r\nqualities which are constant in the dream, and which in its\r\npsychological analysis we must recognise as essential characters of the\r\ndream life. Concerning the pictures\xe2\x80\x94the hypnogogic hallucinations\xe2\x80\x94we\r\nhave discovered that even in their content they are identical with the\r\ndream pictures.\r\n\r\nThe dream therefore thinks preponderately, but not exclusively, in\r\nvisual pictures. It also makes use of auditory pictures, and to a lesser\r\nextent of the impressions of the other senses. Much is also simply\r\nthought or imagined (probably represented by remnants of word\r\npresentations), just as in the waking state. But still what is\r\ncharacteristic for the dream is only those elements of the content which\r\nact like pictures, _i.e._ which resemble more the perceptions than the\r\nmemory presentations. Disregarding all the discussions concerning the\r\nnature of hallucinations, familiar to every psychiatrist, we can say,\r\nwith all well-versed authors, that the dream hallucinates, that is,\r\nreplaces thoughts through hallucinations. In this respect there is no\r\ndifference between visual and acoustic presentations; it has been\r\nnoticed that the memory of a succession of sounds with which one falls\r\nasleep becomes transformed while sinking into sleep into an\r\nhallucination of the same melody, so as to make room again on awakening,\r\nwhich may repeatedly alternate with falling into a slumber, for the\r\nsofter memory presentations which are differently formed in quality.\r\n\r\nThe transformation of an idea into an hallucination is not the only\r\ndeviation of the dream from a waking thought which perhaps corresponds\r\nto it. From these pictures the dream forms a situation, it presents\r\nsomething in the present, it dramatises an idea, as Spitta[64] (p. 145)\r\nputs it.[K] But the characteristic of this side of the dream life\r\nbecomes complete only when it is remembered that while dreaming we do\r\nnot\xe2\x80\x94as a rule; the exceptions require a special explanation\xe2\x80\x94imagine that\r\nwe are thinking, but that we are living through an experience, _i.e._,\r\nwe accept the hallucination with full belief. The criticism that this\r\nhas not been experienced but only thought in a peculiar\r\nmanner\xe2\x80\x94dreamt\xe2\x80\x94comes to us only on awakening. This character\r\ndistinguishes the genuine sleeping dream from day dreaming, which is\r\nnever confused with reality.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the dream life thus far considered have been\r\nsummed up by Burdach[8] (p. 476) in the following sentences: \xe2\x80\x9cAs\r\ncharacteristic features of the dream we may add (_a_) that the\r\nsubjective activity of our mind appears as objective, inasmuch as our\r\nfaculty of perception perceives the products of phantasy as if they were\r\nsensory activities ... (_b_) sleep abrogates one\xe2\x80\x99s self-command, hence\r\nfalling asleep necessitates a certain amount of passivity.... The\r\nslumber pictures are conditioned by the relaxation of one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nself-command.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is a question now of attempting to explain the credulity of the mind\r\nin reference to the dream hallucinations, which can only appear after\r\nthe suspension of a certain arbitrary activity. Str\xc3\xbcmpell[66] asserts\r\nthat the mind behaves in this respect correctly, and in conformity with\r\nits mechanism. The dream elements are by no means mere presentations,\r\nbut true and real experiences of the mind, similar to those that appear\r\nin the waking state as a result of the senses (p. 34). Whereas in the\r\nwaking state the mind represents and thinks in word pictures and\r\nlanguage, in the dream it represents and thinks in real tangible\r\npictures (p. 35). Besides, the dream manifests a consciousness of space\r\nby transferring the sensations and pictures, just as in the waking\r\nstate, into an outer space (p. 36). It must therefore be admitted that\r\nthe mind in the dream is in the same relation to its pictures and\r\nperceptions as in the waking state (p. 43). If, however, it is thereby\r\nled astray, this is due to the fact that it lacks in sleep the criticism\r\nwhich alone can distinguish between the sensory perceptions emanating\r\nfrom within or from without. It cannot subject its pictures to the tests\r\nwhich alone can prove their objective reality. It furthermore neglects\r\nto differentiate between pictures that are arbitrarily interchanged and\r\nothers where there is no free choice. It errs because it cannot apply to\r\nits content the law of causality (p. 58). In brief, its alienation from\r\nthe outer world contains also the reason for its belief in the\r\nsubjective dream world.\r\n\r\nDelb\xc5\x93uf[16] reaches the same conclusion through a somewhat different\r\nline of argument. We give to the dream pictures the credence of reality\r\nbecause in sleep we have no other impressions to compare them with,\r\nbecause we are cut off from the outer world. But it is not perhaps\r\nbecause we are unable to make tests in our sleep, that we believe in the\r\ntruth of our hallucinations. The dream may delude us with all these\r\ntests, it may make us believe that we may touch the rose that we see in\r\nthe dream, and still we only dream. According to Delb\xc5\x93uf there is no\r\nvalid criterion to show whether something is a dream or a conscious\r\nreality, except\xe2\x80\x94and that only in practical generality\xe2\x80\x94the fact of\r\nawakening. \xe2\x80\x9cI declare delusional everything that is experienced between\r\nthe period of falling asleep and awakening, if I notice on awakening\r\nthat I lie in my bed undressed\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 84). \xe2\x80\x9cI have considered the dream\r\npictures real during sleep in consequence of the mental habit, which\r\ncannot be put to sleep, of perceiving an outer world with which I can\r\ncontrast my ego.\xe2\x80\x9d[L]\r\n\r\nAs the deviation from the outer world is taken as the stamp for the most\r\nstriking characteristics of the dream, it will be worth while mentioning\r\nsome ingenious observations of old Burdach[8] which will throw light on\r\nthe relation of the sleeping mind to the outer world and at the same\r\ntime serve to prevent us from over-estimating the above deductions.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSleep results only under the condition,\xe2\x80\x9d says Burdach, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the mind\r\nis not excited by sensory stimuli ... but it is not the lack of sensory\r\nstimuli that conditions sleep, but rather a lack of interest for the\r\nsame; some sensory impressions are even necessary in so far as they\r\nserve to calm the mind; thus the miller can fall asleep only when he\r\nhears the rattling of his mill, and he who finds it necessary to burn a\r\nlight at night, as a matter of precaution, cannot fall asleep in the\r\ndark\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 457).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe psyche isolates itself during sleep from the outer world, and\r\nwithdraws from the periphery.... Nevertheless, the connection is not\r\nentirely interrupted; if one did not hear and feel even during sleep,\r\nbut only after awakening, he would certainly never awake. The\r\ncontinuance of sensation is even more plainly shown by the fact that we\r\nare not always awakened by the mere sensory force of the impression, but\r\nby the psychic relation of the same; an indifferent word does not arouse\r\nthe sleeper, but if called by name he awakens ...: hence the psyche\r\ndifferentiates sensations during sleep.... It is for this reason that we\r\nmay be awakened by the lack of a sensory stimulus if it relates to the\r\npresentation of an important thing; thus one awakens when the light is\r\nextinguished, and the miller when the mill comes to a standstill; that\r\nis, the awakening is due to the cessation of a sensory activity, which\r\npresupposes that it has been perceived, and that it has not disturbed\r\nthe mind, being indifferent or rather gratifying\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 460, &c.).\r\n\r\nIf we are willing to disregard these objections, which are not to be\r\ntaken lightly, we still must admit that the qualities of the dream life\r\nthus far considered, which originate by withdrawing from the outer\r\nworld, cannot fully explain the strangeness of the dream. For otherwise\r\nit would be possible to change back the hallucinations of the dream into\r\npresentations and the situations of the dream into thoughts, and thus to\r\nperform the task of dream interpretation. Now this is what we do when we\r\nreproduce the dream from memory after awakening, and whether we are\r\nfully or only partially successful in this back translation the dream\r\nstill retains its mysteriousness undiminished.\r\n\r\nFurthermore all the authors assume unhesitatingly that still other more\r\nfar-reaching alterations take place in the presentation material of\r\nwaking life. One of them, Str\xc3\xbcmpell,[66] expresses himself as follows\r\n(p. 17): \xe2\x80\x9cWith the cessation of the objectively active outlook and of\r\nthe normal consciousness, the psyche loses the foundation in which were\r\nrooted the feelings, desires, interests, and actions. Those psychic\r\nstates, feelings, interests, estimates which cling in the waking state\r\nto the memory pictures also succumb to ... an obscure pressure, in\r\nconsequence of which their connection with the pictures becomes severed;\r\nthe perception pictures of things, persons, localities, events, and\r\nactions of the waking state are singly very abundantly reproduced, but\r\nnone of these brings along its psychic value. The latter is removed from\r\nthem, and hence they float about in the mind dependent upon their own\r\nresources....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis deprivation the picture suffers of its psychic value, which again\r\ngoes back to the derivation from the outer world, is according to\r\nStr\xc3\xbcmpell mainly responsible for the impression of strangeness with\r\nwhich the dream is confronted in our memory.\r\n\r\nWe have heard that even falling asleep carries with it the abandonment\r\nof one of the psychic activities\xe2\x80\x94namely, the voluntary conduct of the\r\npresentation course. Thus the supposition, suggested also by other\r\ngrounds, obtrudes itself, that the sleeping state may extend its\r\ninfluence also over the psychic functions. One or the other of these\r\nfunctions is perhaps entirely suspended; whether the remaining ones\r\ncontinue to work undisturbed, whether they can furnish normal work under\r\nthe circumstances, is the next question. The idea occurs to us that the\r\npeculiarities of the dream may be explained through the inferior psychic\r\nactivity during the sleeping state, but now comes the impression made by\r\nthe dream upon our waking judgment which is contrary to such a\r\nconception. The dream is disconnected, it unites without hesitation the\r\nworst contradictions, it allows impossibilities, it disregards our\r\nauthoritative knowledge from the day, and evinces ethical and moral\r\ndulness. He who would behave in the waking state as the dream does in\r\nits situations would be considered insane. He who in the waking state\r\nwould speak in such manner or report such things as occur in the dream\r\ncontent, would impress us as confused and weak-minded. Thus we believe\r\nthat we are only finding words for the fact when we place but little\r\nvalue on the psychic activity in the dream, and especially when we\r\ndeclare that the higher intellectual activities are suspended or at\r\nleast much impaired in the dream.\r\n\r\nWith unusual unanimity\xe2\x80\x94the exceptions will be dealt with elsewhere\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nauthors have pronounced their judgments on the dream\xe2\x80\x94such judgments as\r\nlead immediately to a definite theory or explanation of the dream life.\r\nIt is time that I should supplement the _r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9_ which I have just given\r\nwith a collection of the utterances of different authors\xe2\x80\x94philosophers\r\nand physicians\xe2\x80\x94on the psychological character of the dream.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lemoine,[42] the incoherence of the dream picture is the\r\nonly essential character of the dream.\r\n\r\nMaury[48] agrees with him; he says (p. 163): \xe2\x80\x9cIl n\xe2\x80\x99y a pas des r\xc3\xaaves\r\nabsolument raisonnables et qui ne contiennent quelque incoh\xc3\xa9rence,\r\nquelque anachronisme, quelque absurdit\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccording to Hegel, quoted by Spitta,[64] the dream lacks all objective\r\nand comprehensible connection.\r\n\r\nDugas[19] says: \xe2\x80\x9cLe r\xc3\xaave, c\xe2\x80\x99est l\xe2\x80\x99anarchie psychique, affective et\r\nmentale, c\xe2\x80\x99est le jeu des fonctions livr\xc3\xa9es \xc3\xa0 elles-m\xc3\xaames et s\xe2\x80\x99exer\xc3\xa7ant\r\nsans contr\xc3\xb4le et sans but; dans le r\xc3\xaave l\xe2\x80\x99esprit est un automate\r\nspirituel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe relaxation, solution, and confusion of the presentation life which\r\nis held together through the logical force of the central ego\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\nconceded even by Volkelt[72] (p. 14), according to whose theory the\r\npsychic activity during sleep seems in no way aimless.\r\n\r\nThe absurdity of the presentation connections appearing in the dream can\r\nhardly be more strongly condemned than it was by Cicero (_De Divin._\r\nII.): \xe2\x80\x9cNihil tam praepostere, tam incondite, tam monstruose cogitari\r\npotest, quod non possimus somniare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFechner[52] says (p. 522): \xe2\x80\x9cIt is as if the psychological activity were\r\ntransferred from the brain of a reasonable being into the brain of a\r\nfool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRadestock[35] (p. 145) says: \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems indeed impossible to recognise in\r\nthis absurd action any firm law. Having withdrawn itself from the strict\r\npolice of the rational will guiding the waking presentation life, and of\r\nthe attention, the dream whirls everything about kaleidoscopically in\r\nmad play.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHildebrandt[35] (p. 45) says: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat wonderful jumps the dreamer allows\r\nhimself, _e.g._, in his chain of reasoning! With what unconcern he sees\r\nthe most familiar laws of experience turned upside down! What ridiculous\r\ncontradictions he can tolerate in the orders of nature and society\r\nbefore things go too far, as we say, and the overstraining of the\r\nnonsense brings an awakening! We often multiply quite unconcernedly:\r\nthree times three make twenty; we are not at all surprised when a dog\r\nrecites poetry for us, when a dead person walks to his grave, and when a\r\nrock swims on the water; we go in all earnestness by high command to the\r\nduchy of Bernburg or the principality of Lichtenstein in order to\r\nobserve the navy of the country, or we allow ourselves to be recruited\r\nas a volunteer by Charles XII. shortly before the battle of Poltawa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBinz[4] (p. 33) points to a dream theory resulting from the impressions.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmong ten dreams nine at least have an absurd content. We unite in them\r\npersons or things which do not bear the slightest relation to one\r\nanother. In the next moment, as in a kaleidoscope, the grouping changes,\r\nif possible to one more nonsensical and irrational than before; thus the\r\nchanging play of the imperfectly sleeping brain continues until we\r\nawaken, and put our hand to our forehead and ask ourselves whether we\r\nreally still possess the faculty of rational imagination and thought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaury[48] (p. 50) finds for the relation of the dream picture to the\r\nwaking thoughts, a comparison most impressive for the physician: \xe2\x80\x9cLa\r\nproduction de ces images que chez l\xe2\x80\x99homme \xc3\xa9veill\xc3\xa9 fait le plus souvent\r\nna\xc3\xaetre la volont\xc3\xa9, correspond, pour l\xe2\x80\x99intelligence, \xc3\xa0 ce que cont pour\r\nla motilit\xc3\xa9 certains mouvements que nous offrent la chor\xc3\xa9e et les\r\naffections paralytiques....\xe2\x80\x9d For the rest, he considers the dream \xe2\x80\x9ctoute\r\nune s\xc3\xa9rie de d\xc3\xa9gradation de la facult\xc3\xa9 pensant et raisonant\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 27).\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to mention the utterances of the authors which\r\nrepeat Maury\xe2\x80\x99s assertion for the individual higher psychic activities.\r\n\r\nAccording to Str\xc3\xbcmpell,[66] some logical mental operations based on\r\nrelations and connections disappear in the dream\xe2\x80\x94naturally also at\r\npoints where the nonsense is not obvious (p. 26). According to\r\nSpitta,[64] (p. 148) the presentations in the dream are entirely\r\nwithdrawn from the laws of causality. Radestock[54] and others emphasize\r\nthe weakness of judgment and decision in the dream. According to\r\nJodl[37] (p. 123), there is no critique in the dream, and no correcting\r\nof a series of perceptions through the content of the sum of\r\nconsciousness. The same author states that \xe2\x80\x9call forms of conscious\r\nactivity occur in the dream, but they are imperfect, inhibited, and\r\nisolated from one another.\xe2\x80\x9d The contradictions manifested in the dream\r\ntowards our conscious knowledge are explained by Stricker[77][78] (and\r\nmany others), on the ground that facts are forgotten in the dream and\r\nlogical relations between presentations are lost (p. 98), &c., &c.\r\n\r\nThe authors who in general speak thus unfavourably about the psychic\r\ncapacities in the dream, nevertheless admit that the dream retains a\r\ncertain remnant of psychic activity. Wundt,[76] whose teaching has\r\ninfluenced so many other workers in the dream problems, positively\r\nadmits this. One might inquire as to the kind and behaviour of the\r\nremnants of the psychic life which manifest themselves in the dream. It\r\nis now quite universally acknowledged that the reproductive capacity,\r\nthe memory in the dream, seems to have been least affected; indeed it\r\nmay show a certain superiority over the same function in the waking life\r\n(_vid. supra_, p. 10), although a part of the absurdities of the dream\r\nare to be explained by just this forgetfulness of the dream life.\r\nAccording to Spitta,[64] it is the emotional life of the psyche that is\r\nnot overtaken by sleep and that then directs the dream. \xe2\x80\x9cBy emotion\r\n[\xe2\x80\x9cGem\xc3\xbcth\xe2\x80\x9d] we understand the constant comprehension of the feelings as\r\nthe inmost subjective essence of man\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 84).\r\n\r\nScholz[59] (p. 37) sees a psychic activity manifested in the dream in\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9callegorising interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d to which the dream material is\r\nsubjected. Siebeck[62] verifies also in the dream the \xe2\x80\x9csupplementary\r\ninterpretative activity\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 11) which the mind exerts on all that is\r\nperceived and viewed. The judgment of the apparently highest psychic\r\nfunction, the consciousness, presents for the dream a special\r\ndifficulty. As we can know anything only through consciousness, there\r\ncan be no doubt as to its retention; Spitta, however, believes that only\r\nconsciousness is retained in the dream, and not self-consciousness.\r\nDelb\xc5\x93uf[16] confesses that he is unable to conceive this\r\ndifferentiation.\r\n\r\nThe laws of association which govern the connection of ideas hold true\r\nalso for the dream pictures; indeed, their domination evinces itself in\r\na purer and stronger expression in the dream than elsewhere.\r\nStr\xc3\xbcmpell[62] (p. 70) says: \xe2\x80\x9cThe dream follows either the laws of\r\nundisguised presentations as it seems exclusively or organic stimuli\r\nalong with such presentations, that is, without being influenced by\r\nreflection and reason, \xc3\xa6sthetic sense, and moral judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d The authors\r\nwhose views I reproduce here conceive the formation of the dream in\r\nabout the following manner: The sum of sensation stimuli affecting sleep\r\nfrom the various sources, discussed elsewhere, at first awaken in the\r\nmind a sum of presentations which represent themselves as hallucinations\r\n(according to Wundt, it is more correct to say as illusions, because of\r\ntheir origin from outer and inner stimuli). These unite with one another\r\naccording to the known laws of association, and, following the same\r\nrules, in turn evoke a new series of presentations (pictures). This\r\nentire material is then elaborated as well as possible by the still\r\nactive remnant of the organising and thinking mental faculties (_cf._\r\nWundt[76] and Weygandt[75]). But thus far no one has been successful in\r\nfinding the motive which would decide that the awakening of pictures\r\nwhich do not originate objectively follow this or that law of\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\nBut it has been repeatedly observed that the associations which connect\r\nthe dream presentations with one another are of a particular kind, and\r\ndifferent from those found in the waking mental activity. Thus\r\nVolkelt[72] says: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the dream, the ideas chase and hunt each other on\r\nthe strength of accidental similarities and barely perceptible\r\nconnections. All dreams are pervaded by such loose and free\r\nassociations.\xe2\x80\x9d Maury[48] attaches great value to this characteristic of\r\nconnection between presentations, which allows him to bring the dream\r\nlife in closer analogy to certain mental disturbances. He recognises two\r\nmain characters of the _d\xc3\xa9lire_: \xe2\x80\x9c(1) une action spontan\xc3\xa9e et comme\r\nautomatique de l\xe2\x80\x99esprit; (2) une association vicieuse et irreguli\xc3\xa8re des\r\nid\xc3\xa9es\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 126). Maury gives us two excellent examples from his own\r\ndreams, in which the mere similarity of sound forms the connection of\r\nthe dream presentations. He dreamed once that he undertook a pilgrimage\r\n(_p\xc3\xa9lerinage_) to Jerusalem or Mecca. After many adventures he was with\r\nthe chemist Pelletier; the latter after some talk gave him a zinc shovel\r\n(_pelle_) which became his long battle sword in the dream fragment which\r\nfollowed (p. 137). On another occasion he walked in a dream on the\r\nhighway and read the kilometres on the milestones; presently he was with\r\na spice merchant who had large scales with which to weigh Maury; the\r\nspice merchant then said to him: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not in Paris; but on the\r\nisland Gilolo.\xe2\x80\x9d This was followed by many pictures, in which he saw the\r\nflower Lobelia, then the General Lopez, of whose demise he had read\r\nshortly before. He finally awoke while playing a game of lotto.\r\n\r\nWe are, however, quite prepared to hear that this depreciation of the\r\npsychic activities of the dream has not remained without contradiction\r\nfrom the other side. To be sure, contradiction seems difficult here. Nor\r\nis it of much significance that one of the depreciators of dream life,\r\nSpitta[64] (p. 118), assures us that the same psychological laws which\r\ngovern the waking state rule the dream also, or that another (Dugas[19])\r\nstates: \xe2\x80\x9cLe r\xc3\xaave n\xe2\x80\x99est pas d\xc3\xa9raison ni m\xc3\xaame irraison pure,\xe2\x80\x9d as long as\r\nneither of them has made any effort to bring this estimation into\r\nharmony with the psychic anarchy and dissolution of all functions in the\r\ndream described by them. Upon others, however, the possibility seems to\r\nhave dawned that the madness of the dream is perhaps not without its\r\nmethod\xe2\x80\x94that it is perhaps only a sham, like that of the Danish prince,\r\nto whose madness the intelligent judgment here cited refers. These\r\nauthors must have refrained from judging by appearances, or the\r\nappearance which the dream showed to them was quite different.\r\n\r\nWithout wishing to linger at its apparent absurdity, Havelock Ellis[23]\r\nconsiders the dream as \xe2\x80\x9can archaic world of vast emotions and imperfect\r\nthoughts,\xe2\x80\x9d the study of which may make us acquainted with primitive\r\nstages of development of the psychic life. A thinker like Delb\xc5\x93uf[16]\r\nasserts\xe2\x80\x94to be sure without adducing proof against the contradictory\r\nmaterial, and hence indeed unjustly: \xe2\x80\x9cDans le sommeil, hormis la\r\nperception, toutes les facult\xc3\xa9s de l\xe2\x80\x99esprit, intelligence, imagination,\r\nm\xc3\xa9moire, volont\xc3\xa9, moralit\xc3\xa9, restant intactes dans leur essence;\r\nseulement, elles s\xe2\x80\x99appliquent \xc3\xa0 des objets imaginaires et mobiles. Le\r\nsongeur est un acteur qui joue \xc3\xa0 volont\xc3\xa9 les fous et les sages, les\r\nbourreaux et les victimes, les nains et les g\xc3\xa9ants, les d\xc3\xa9mons et les\r\nanges\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 222). The Marquis of Hervey, who is sharply controverted by\r\nMaury,[48] and whose work I could not obtain despite all effort, seems\r\nto combat most energetically the under-estimation of the psychic\r\ncapacity in the dream. Maury speaks of him as follows (p. 19): \xe2\x80\x9cM. le\r\nMarquis d\xe2\x80\x99Hervey pr\xc3\xaate \xc3\xa0 l\xe2\x80\x99intelligence, durant le sommeil toute sa\r\nlibert\xc3\xa9 d\xe2\x80\x99action et d\xe2\x80\x99attention et il ne semble faire consister le\r\nsommeil que dans l\xe2\x80\x99occlusion des sens, dans leur fermeture au monde\r\next\xc3\xa9rieur; en sorte que l\xe2\x80\x99homme qui dort ne se distingu\xc3\xa9 gu\xc3\xa8re, selon sa\r\nmani\xc3\xa8re de voir, de l\xe2\x80\x99homme qui laisse vaguer sa pens\xc3\xa9e en se bouchant\r\nles sens; toute la diff\xc3\xa9rence qui s\xc3\xa9par\xc3\xa9 alors la pens\xc3\xa9e ordinaire du\r\ncelle du dormeur c\xe2\x80\x99est que, chez celui-ci, l\xe2\x80\x99id\xc3\xa9e prend une forme\r\nvisible, objective et ressemble, \xc3\xa0 s\xe2\x80\x99y m\xc3\xa9prendre, \xc3\xa0 la sensation\r\nd\xc3\xa9termin\xc3\xa9e par les objets ext\xc3\xa9rieurs; le souvenir rev\xc3\xaat l\xe2\x80\x99apparence du\r\nfait pr\xc3\xa9sent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaury adds, however; \xe2\x80\x9cQu\xe2\x80\x99il y a une diff\xc3\xa9rence de plus et capitale \xc3\xa0\r\nsavoir que les facult\xc3\xa9s intellectuelles de l\xe2\x80\x99homme endormi n\xe2\x80\x99offrent pas\r\nl\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9quilibre qu\xe2\x80\x99elles gardent chez l\xe2\x80\x99homme l\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9veill\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe scale of the estimation of the dream as a psychic product has a\r\ngreat range in the literature; it reaches from the lowest\r\nunder-estimation, the expression of which we have come to know, through\r\nthe idea of a value not yet revealed to the over-estimation which places\r\nthe dream far above the capacities of the waking life. Hildebrandt,[35]\r\nwho, as we know, sketches the psychological characteristics into three\r\nantinomies, sums up in the third of these contradistinctions the extreme\r\npoints of this series as follows (p. 19): \xe2\x80\x9cIt is between a climax, often\r\nan involution which raises itself to virtuosity, and on the other hand a\r\ndecided diminution and weakening of the psychic life often leading below\r\nthe human niveau.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for the first, who could not confirm from his own experience that,\r\nin the creations and weavings of the genius of the dream, there\r\nsometimes comes to light a profundity and sincerity of emotion, a\r\ntenderness of feeling, a clearness of view, a fineness of observation,\r\nand a readiness of wit, all which we should modestly have to deny that\r\nwe possess as a constant property during the waking life? The dream has\r\na wonderful poetry, an excellent allegory, an incomparable humour, and a\r\ncharming irony. It views the world under the guise of a peculiar\r\nidealisation, and often raises the effect of its manifestations into the\r\nmost ingenious understanding of the essence lying at its basis. It\r\nrepresents for us earthly beauty in true heavenly radiance, the sublime\r\nin the highest majesty, the actually frightful in the most gruesome\r\nfigure, and the ridiculous in the indescribably drastic comical; and at\r\ntimes we are so full of one of these impressions after awakening that we\r\nimagine that such a thing has never been offered to us by the real\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne may ask, is it really the same object that the depreciating remarks\r\nand these inspired praises are meant for? Have the latter overlooked the\r\nstupid dreams and the former the thoughtful and ingenious dreams? And if\r\nboth kinds do occur\xe2\x80\x94that is, dreams that merit to be judged in this or\r\nthat manner\xe2\x80\x94does it not seem idle to seek the psychological character of\r\nthe dream? Would it not suffice to state that everything is possible in\r\nthe dream, from the lowest depreciation of the psychic life to a raising\r\nof the same which is unusual in the waking state? As convenient as this\r\nsolution would be it has this against it, that behind the efforts of all\r\ndream investigators, it seems to be presupposed that there is such a\r\ndefinable character of the dream, which is universally valid in its\r\nessential features and which must eliminate these contradictions.\r\n\r\nIt is unquestionable that the psychic capacities of the dream have found\r\nquicker and warmer recognition in that intellectual period which now\r\nlies behind us, when philosophy rather than exact natural science ruled\r\nintelligent minds. Utterances like those of Schubert, that the dream\r\nfrees the mind from the power of outer nature, that it liberates the\r\nsoul from the chains of the sensual, and similar opinions expressed by\r\nthe younger Fichte,[M] and others, who represent the dream as a soaring\r\nup of the psychic life to a higher stage, hardly seem conceivable to us\r\nto-day; they are only repeated at present by mystics and devotees. With\r\nthe advance of the scientific mode of thinking, a reaction took place in\r\nthe estimation of the dream. It is really the medical authors who are\r\nmost prone to underrate the psychic activity in the dream, as being\r\ninsignificant and invaluable, whereas, philosophers and unprofessional\r\nobservers\xe2\x80\x94amateur psychologists\xe2\x80\x94whose contributions in this realm can\r\nsurely not be overlooked, in better agreement with the popular ideas,\r\nhave mostly adhered to the psychic value of the dream. He who is\r\ninclined to underrate the psychic capacity in the dream prefers, as a\r\nmatter of course, the somatic exciting sources in the etiology of the\r\ndream; he who leaves to the dreaming mind the greater part of its\r\ncapacities, naturally has no reason for not also admitting independent\r\nstimuli for dreaming.\r\n\r\nAmong the superior activities which, even on sober comparison, one is\r\ntempted to ascribe to the dream life, memory is the most striking; we\r\nhave fully discussed the frequent experiences which prove this fact.\r\nAnother superiority of the dream life, frequently extolled by the old\r\nauthors, viz. that it can regard itself supreme in reference to distance\r\nof time and space, can be readily recognised as an illusion. This\r\nsuperiority, as observed by Hildebrandt,[35] is only illusional; the\r\ndream takes as much heed of time and space as the waking thought, and\r\nthis because it is only a form of thinking. The dream is supposed to\r\nenjoy still another advantage in reference to time; that is, it is\r\nindependent in still another sense of the passage of time. Dreams like\r\nthe guillotine dream of Maury,[48] reported above, seem to show that the\r\ndream can crowd together more perception content in a very short space\r\nof time than can be controlled by our psychic activity in the waking\r\nmind. These conclusions have been controverted, however, by many\r\narguments; the essays of Le Lorrain[45] and Egger[20] \xe2\x80\x9cConcerning the\r\napparent duration of dreams\xe2\x80\x9d gave rise to a long and interesting\r\ndiscussion which has probably not said the last word upon this delicate\r\nand far-reaching question.\r\n\r\nThat the dream has the ability to take up the intellectual work of the\r\nday and bring to a conclusion what has not been settled during the day,\r\nthat it can solve doubt and problems, and that it may become the source\r\nof new inspiration in poets and composers, seems to be indisputable, as\r\nis shown by many reports and by the collection compiled by\r\nChabaneix.[11] But even if there be no dispute as to the facts,\r\nnevertheless their interpretation is open in principle to a great many\r\ndoubts.\r\n\r\nFinally the asserted divinatory power of the dream forms an object of\r\ncontention in which hard unsurmountable reflection encounters obstinate\r\nand continued faith. It is indeed just that we should refrain from\r\ndenying all that is based on fact in this subject, as there is a\r\npossibility that a number of such cases may perhaps be explained on a\r\nnatural psychological basis.\r\n\r\n(_f_) _The Ethical Feelings in the Dream._\xe2\x80\x94For reasons which will be\r\nunderstood only after cognisance has been taken of my own investigations\r\nof the dream, I have separated from the psychology of the dream the\r\npartial problem whether and to what extent the moral dispositions and\r\nfeelings of the waking life extend into the dreams. The same\r\ncontradictions which we were surprised to observe in the authors\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndescriptions of all the other psychic capacities strike us again here.\r\nSome affirm decidedly that the dream knows nothing of moral obligations;\r\nothers as decidedly that the moral nature of man remains even in his\r\ndream life.\r\n\r\nA reference to our dream experience of every night seems to raise the\r\ncorrectness of the first assertion beyond doubt. Jessen[36] says (p.\r\n553): \xe2\x80\x9cNor does one become better or more virtuous in the dream; on the\r\ncontrary, it seems that conscience is silent in the dream, inasmuch as\r\none feels no compassion and can commit the worst crimes, such as theft,\r\nmurder, and assassination, with perfect indifference and without\r\nsubsequent remorse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRadestock[54] (p. 146) says: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is to be noticed that in the dream the\r\nassociations terminate and the ideas unite without being influenced by\r\nreflection and reason, \xc3\xa6sthetic taste, and moral judgment; the judgment\r\nis extremely weak, and ethical indifference reigns supreme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVolkelt[72] (p. 23) expresses himself as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cAs every one knows,\r\nthe sexual relationship in the dream is especially unbridled. Just as\r\nthe dreamer himself is shameless in the extreme, and wholly lacking\r\nmoral feeling and judgment, so also he sees others, even the most\r\nhonoured persons, engaged in actions which even in thought he would\r\nblush to associate with them in his waking state.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUtterances like those of Schopenhauer, that in the dream every person\r\nacts and talks in accordance with his character, form the sharpest\r\ncontrast to those mentioned above. R. P. Fischer[N] maintains that the\r\nsubjective feelings and desires or affects and passions manifest\r\nthemselves in the wilfulness of the dream life, and that the moral\r\ncharacteristics of a person are mirrored in his dream.\r\n\r\nHaffner[32] (p. 25): \xe2\x80\x9cWith rare exceptions ... a virtuous person will be\r\nvirtuous also in his dreams; he will resist temptation, and show no\r\nsympathy for hatred, envy, anger, and all other vices; while the sinful\r\nperson will, as a rule, also find in his dreams the pictures which he\r\nhas before him while awake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nScholz[59] (p. 36): \xe2\x80\x9cIn the dream there is truth; despite all masking in\r\npride or humility, we still recognise our own self.... The honest man\r\ndoes not commit any dishonourable offence even in the dream, or, if this\r\ndoes occur, he is terrified over it as if over something foreign to his\r\nnature. The Roman emperor who ordered one of his subjects to be executed\r\nbecause he dreamed that he cut off the emperor\xe2\x80\x99s head, was not wrong in\r\njustifying his action on the ground that he who has such dreams must\r\nhave similar thoughts while awake. About a thing that can have no place\r\nin our mind we therefore say significantly: \xe2\x80\x98I would never dream of such\r\na thing.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPfaff,[O] varying a familiar proverb, says: \xe2\x80\x9cTell me for a time your\r\ndreams, and I will tell you what you are within.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe short work of Hildebrandt,[35] from which I have already taken so\r\nmany quotations, a contribution to the dream problem as complete and as\r\nrich in thought as I found in the literature, places the problem of\r\nmorality in the dream as the central point of its interest. For\r\nHildebrandt, too, it is a strict rule that the purer the life, the purer\r\nthe dream; the impurer the former, the impurer the latter.\r\n\r\nThe moral nature of man remains even in the dream: \xe2\x80\x9cBut while we are not\r\noffended nor made suspicious by an arithmetical error no matter how\r\nobvious, by a reversal of science no matter how romantic, or by an\r\nanachronism no matter how witty, we nevertheless do not lose sight of\r\nthe difference between good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice.\r\nNo matter how much of what follows us during the day may vanish in our\r\nhours of sleep\xe2\x80\x94Kant\xe2\x80\x99s categorical imperative sticks to our heels as an\r\ninseparable companion from whom we cannot rid ourselves even in\r\nslumber.... This can be explained, however, only by the fact that the\r\nfundamental in human nature, the moral essence, is too firmly fixed to\r\ntake part in the activity of the kaleidoscopic shaking up to which\r\nphantasy, reason, memory, and other faculties of the same rank succumb\r\nin the dream\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 45, &c.).\r\n\r\nIn the further discussion of the subject we find remarkable distortion\r\nand inconsequence in both groups of authors. Strictly speaking, interest\r\nin immoral dreams would cease for all those who assert that the moral\r\npersonality of the person crumbles away in the dream. They could just as\r\ncalmly reject the attempt to hold the dreamer responsible for his\r\ndreams, and to draw inferences from the badness of his dreams as to an\r\nevil strain in his nature, as they rejected the apparently similar\r\nattempt to demonstrate the insignificance of his intellectual life in\r\nthe waking state from the absurdity of his dreams. The others for whom\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe categorical imperative\xe2\x80\x9d extends also into the dream, would have to\r\naccept full responsibility for the immoral dreams; it would only be\r\ndesirable for their own sake that their own objectionable dreams should\r\nnot lead them to abandon the otherwise firmly held estimation of their\r\nown morality.\r\n\r\nStill it seems that no one knows exactly about himself how good or how\r\nbad he is, and that no one can deny the recollection of his own immoral\r\ndreams. For besides the opposition already mentioned in the criticism of\r\nthe morality of the dream, both groups of authors display an effort to\r\nexplain the origin of the immoral dream and a new opposition is\r\ndeveloped, depending on whether their origin is sought in the functions\r\nof the psychic life or in the somatically determined injuries to this\r\nlife. The urgent force of the facts then permits the representatives of\r\nthe responsibility, as well as of the irresponsibility of the dream\r\nlife, to agree in the recognition of a special psychic source for the\r\nimmorality of dreams.\r\n\r\nAll those who allow the continuance of the morality in the dream\r\nnevertheless guard against accepting full responsibility for their\r\ndreams. Haffner[32] says (p. 24): \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not responsible for dreams\r\nbecause the basis upon which alone our life has truth and reality is\r\nremoved from our thoughts.... Hence there can be no dream wishing and\r\ndream acting, no virtue or sin.\xe2\x80\x9d Still the person is responsible for the\r\nsinful dream in so far as he brings it about indirectly. Just as in the\r\nwaking state, it is his duty to cleanse his moral mind, particularly so\r\nbefore retiring to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of this mixture of rejection and recognition of\r\nresponsibility for the moral content of the dream is followed much\r\nfurther by Hildebrandt. After specifying that the dramatic manner of\r\nrepresentation in the dream, the crowding together of the most\r\ncomplicated processes of deliberation in the briefest period of time,\r\nand the depreciation and the confusion of the presentation elements in\r\nthe dream admitted by him must be recognised as unfavourable to the\r\nimmoral aspect of dreams; he nevertheless confesses that, yielding to\r\nthe most earnest reflection, he is inclined simply to deny all\r\nresponsibility for faults and dream sins.\r\n\r\n(P. 49): \xe2\x80\x9cIf we wish to reject very decisively any unjust accusation,\r\nespecially one that has reference to our intentions and convictions, we\r\nnaturally make use of the expression: I should never have dreamed of\r\nsuch a thing. By this we mean to say, of course, that we consider the\r\nrealm of the dream the last and remotest place in which we are to be\r\nheld responsible for our thoughts, because there these thoughts are only\r\nloosely and incoherently connected with our real being, so that we\r\nshould hardly still consider them as our own; but as we feel impelled\r\nexpressly to deny the existence of such thoughts, even in this realm, we\r\nthus at the same time indirectly admit that our justification will not\r\nbe complete if it does not reach to that point. And I believe that,\r\nthough unconsciously, we here speak the language of truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(P. 52): \xe2\x80\x9cNo dream thought can be imagined whose first motive has not\r\nalready moved through the mind while awake as some wish, desire, or\r\nimpulse.\xe2\x80\x9d Concerning this original impulse we must say that the dream\r\nhas not discovered it\xe2\x80\x94it has only imitated and extended it, it has only\r\nelaborated a bit of historical material which it has found in us, into\r\ndramatic form; it enacts the words of the apostle: He who hates his\r\nbrother is a murderer. And whereas, after we awaken and become conscious\r\nof our moral strength, we may smile at the boldly executed structure of\r\nthe depraved dream, the original formative material, nevertheless, has\r\nno ridiculous side. One feels responsible for the transgressions of the\r\ndreamer, not for the whole sum, but still for a certain percentage. \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nthis sense, which is difficult to impugn, we understand the words of\r\nChrist: Out of the heart come evil thoughts\xe2\x80\x94for we can hardly help being\r\nconvinced that every sin committed in the dream brings with it at least\r\na vague minimum of guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHildebrandt thus finds the source of the immorality of dreams in the\r\ngerms and indications of evil impulses which pass through our minds\r\nduring the day as tempting thoughts, and he sees fit to add these\r\nimmoral elements to the moral estimation of the personality. It is the\r\nsame thoughts and the same estimation of these thoughts, which, as we\r\nknow, have caused devout and holy men of all times to lament that they\r\nare evil sinners.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly no reason to doubt the general occurrence of these\r\ncontrasting presentations\xe2\x80\x94in most men and even also in other than\r\nethical spheres. The judgment of these at times has not been very\r\nearnest. In Spitta[64] we find the following relevant expression from A.\r\nZeller (Article \xe2\x80\x9cIrre\xe2\x80\x9d in the _Allgemeinen Encyklop\xc3\xa4die der\r\nWissenschaften_ of Ersch and Gr\xc3\xbcber, p. 144): \xe2\x80\x9cThe mind is rarely so\r\nhappily organised as to possess at all times power enough not to be\r\ndisturbed, not only by unessential but also by perfectly ridiculous\r\nideas running counter to the usual clear trend of thought; indeed, the\r\ngreatest thinkers have had cause to complain of this dreamlike\r\ndisturbing and painful rabble of ideas, as it destroys their profoundest\r\nreflection and their most sacred and earnest mental work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA clearer light is thrown on the psychological status of this idea of\r\ncontrast by another observation of Hildebrandt, that the dream at times\r\nallows us to glance into the deep and inmost recesses of our being,\r\nwhich are generally closed to us in our waking state (p. 55). The same\r\nknowledge is revealed by Kant in his _Anthropology_, when he states that\r\nthe dream exists in order to lay bare for us our hidden dispositions and\r\nto reveal to us not what we are, but what we might have been if we had a\r\ndifferent education. Radestock[54] (p. 84) says that the dream often\r\nonly reveals to us what we do not wish to admit to ourselves, and that\r\nwe therefore unjustly condemn it as a liar and deceiver. That the\r\nappearance of impulses which are foreign to our consciousness is merely\r\nanalogous to the already familiar disposition which the dream makes of\r\nother material of the presentation, which is either absent or plays only\r\nan insignificant part in the waking state, has been called to our\r\nattention by observations like those of Benini,[3] who says: \xe2\x80\x9cCerte\r\nnostre inclinazione che si credevano soffocate a spente da un pezzo, si\r\nridestano; passioni vecchie e sepolte rivivono; cose e persone a cui non\r\npensiamo mai, ci vengono dinanzi\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 149). Volkelt[72] expresses\r\nhimself in a similar way: \xe2\x80\x9cEven presentations which have entered into\r\nour consciousness almost unnoticed, and have never perhaps been brought\r\nout from oblivion, often announce through the dream their presence in\r\nthe mind\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 105). Finally, it is not out of place to mention here\r\nthat, according to Schleiermacher,[61] the state of falling asleep is\r\naccompanied by the appearance of undesirable presentations (pictures).\r\n\r\nWe may comprise under \xe2\x80\x9cundesirable presentations\xe2\x80\x9d this entire material\r\nof presentations, the occurrence of which excites our wonder in immoral\r\nas well as in absurd dreams. The only important difference consists in\r\nthe fact that our undesirable presentations in the moral sphere exhibit\r\nan opposition to our other feelings, whereas the others simply appear\r\nstrange to us. Nothing has been done so far to enable us to remove this\r\ndifference through a more penetrating knowledge.\r\n\r\nBut what is the significance of the appearance of undesirable\r\npresentations in the dream? What inferences may be drawn for the\r\npsychology of the waking and dreaming mind from these nocturnal\r\nmanifestations of contrasting ethical impulses? We may here note a new\r\ndiversity of opinion, and once more a different grouping of the authors.\r\nThe stream of thought followed by Hildebrandt, and by others who\r\nrepresent his fundamental view, cannot be continued in any other way\r\nthan by ascribing to the immoral impulses a certain force even in the\r\nwaking state, which, to be sure, is inhibited from advancing to action,\r\nand asserting that something falls off during sleep, which, having the\r\neffect of an inhibition, has kept us from noticing the existence of such\r\nan impulse. The dream thus shows the real, if not the entire nature of\r\nman, and is a means of making the hidden psychic life accessible to our\r\nunderstanding. It is only on such assumption that Hildebrandt can\r\nattribute to the dream the r\xc3\xb4le of monitor who calls our attention to\r\nthe moral ravages in the soul, just as in the opinion of physicians it\r\ncan announce a hitherto unobserved physical ailment. Spitta,[64] too,\r\ncannot be guided by any other conception when he refers to the stream of\r\nexcitement which, _e.g._, flows in upon the psyche during puberty, and\r\nconsoles the dreamer by saying that he has done everything in his power\r\nwhen he has led a strictly virtuous life during his waking state, when\r\nhe has made an effort to suppress the sinful thoughts as often as they\r\narise, and has kept them from maturing and becoming actions. According\r\nto this conception, we might designate the \xe2\x80\x9cundesirable\xe2\x80\x9d presentations\r\nas those that are \xe2\x80\x9csuppressed\xe2\x80\x9d during the day, and must recognise in\r\ntheir appearance a real psychic phenomenon.\r\n\r\nIf we followed other authors we would have no right to the last\r\ninference. For Jessen[36] the undesirable presentations in the dream as\r\nin the waking state, in fever and other deliria, merely have \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\ncharacter of a voluntary activity put to rest and a somewhat mechanical\r\nprocess of pictures and presentations produced by inner impulses\xe2\x80\x9d (p.\r\n360). An immoral dream proves nothing for the psychic life of the\r\ndreamer except that he has in some way become cognizant of the ideas in\r\nquestion; it is surely not a psychic impulse of his own. Another author,\r\nMaury,[48] makes us question whether he, too, does not attribute to the\r\ndream state the capacity for dividing the psychic activity into its\r\ncomponents instead of destroying it aimlessly. He speaks as follows\r\nabout dreams in which one goes beyond the bounds of morality: \xe2\x80\x9cCe sont\r\nnos penchants qui parlent et qui nous font agir, sans que la conscience\r\nnous retienne, bien que parfois elle nous avertisse. J\xe2\x80\x99ai mes d\xc3\xa9fauts et\r\nmes penchants vicieux; \xc3\xa0 l\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tat de veille, je tache de lutter contre\r\neux, et il m\xe2\x80\x99arrive assez souvent de n\xe2\x80\x99y pas succomber. Mais dans mes\r\nsonges j\xe2\x80\x99y succombe toujours ou pour mieux dire j\xe2\x80\x99agis, par leur\r\nimpulsion, sans crainte et sans remords.... \xc3\x89videmment les visions qui\r\nse d\xc3\xa9roulent devant ma pens\xc3\xa9e et qui constituent le r\xc3\xaave, me sont\r\nsugg\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9es par les incitations que je ressens et que ma volont\xc3\xa9 absente\r\nne cherche pas \xc3\xa0 refouler\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 113).\r\n\r\nIf one believes in the capacity of the dream to reveal an actually\r\nexisting but repressed or concealed immoral disposition of the dreamer,\r\nhe could not emphasize his opinion more strongly than with the words of\r\nMaury (p. 115): \xe2\x80\x9cEn r\xc3\xaave l\xe2\x80\x99homme se r\xc3\xa9v\xc3\xa8le donc tout entier \xc3\xa0 soi-m\xc3\xaame\r\ndans sa nudit\xc3\xa9 et sa mis\xc3\xa8re natives. D\xc3\xa8s qu\xe2\x80\x99il suspend l\xe2\x80\x99exercice de sa\r\nvolont\xc3\xa9, il d\xc3\xa9vient le jouet de toutes les passions contre lesquelles, \xc3\xa0\r\nl\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tat de veille, la conscience, le sentiment d\xe2\x80\x99honneur, la crainte nous\r\nd\xc3\xa9fendent.\xe2\x80\x9d In another place he finds the following striking words (p.\r\n462): \xe2\x80\x9cDans le r\xc3\xaave, c\xe2\x80\x99est surtout l\xe2\x80\x99homme instinctif que se r\xc3\xa9v\xc3\xa8le....\r\nL\xe2\x80\x99homme revient pour ainsi dire \xc3\xa0 l\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tat de nature quand il r\xc3\xaave; mais\r\nmoins les id\xc3\xa9es acquises ont p\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9tr\xc3\xa9 dans son esprit, plus les penchants\r\nen d\xc3\xa9saccord avec elles conservent encore sur lui d\xe2\x80\x99influence dans le\r\nr\xc3\xaave.\xe2\x80\x9d He then mentions as an example that his dreams often show him as\r\na victim of just those superstitions which he most violently combats in\r\nhis writing.\r\n\r\nThe value of all these ingenious observations for a psychological\r\nknowledge of the dream life, however, is marred by Maury through the\r\nfact that he refuses to recognise in the phenomena so correctly observed\r\nby him any proof of the \xe2\x80\x9cautomatisme psychologique\xe2\x80\x9d which in his opinion\r\ndominates the dream life. He conceives this automatism as a perfect\r\ncontrast to the psychic activity.\r\n\r\nA passage in the studies on consciousness by Stricker[77] reads: \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\ndream does not consist of delusions merely; if, _e.g._, one is afraid of\r\nrobbers in the dream, the robbers are, of course, imaginary, but the\r\nfear is real. One\xe2\x80\x99s attention is thus called to the fact that the\r\neffective development in the dream does not admit of the judgment which\r\none bestows upon the rest of the dream content, and the problem arises\r\nwhat part of the psychic processes in the dream may be real, _i.e._ what\r\npart of them may demand to be enrolled among the psychic processes of\r\nthe waking state?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(_g_) _Dream Theories and Functions of the Dream._\xe2\x80\x94A statement\r\nconcerning the dream which as far as possible attempts to explain from\r\none point of view many of its noted characters, and which at the same\r\ntime determines the relation of the dream to a more comprehensive sphere\r\nof manifestations, may be called a theory of dreams. Individual theories\r\nof the dream will be distinguished from one another through the fact\r\nthat they raise to prominence this or that characteristic of the dream,\r\nand connect explanations and relations with it. It will not be\r\nabsolutely necessary to derive from the theory a function, _i.e._ a use\r\nor any such activity of the dream, but our expectation, which is usually\r\nadjusted to teleology, will nevertheless welcome those theories which\r\npromise an understanding of the function of the dream.\r\n\r\nWe have already become acquainted with many conceptions of the dream\r\nwhich, more or less, merit the name of dream theories in this sense. The\r\nbelief of the ancients that the dream was sent by the gods in order to\r\nguide the actions of man was a complete theory of the dream giving\r\ninformation concerning everything in the dream worth knowing. Since the\r\ndream has become an object of biological investigation we have a greater\r\nnumber of theories, of which, however, some are very incomplete.\r\n\r\nIf we waive completeness, we may attempt the following loose grouping of\r\ndream theories based on their fundamental conception of the degree and\r\nmode of the psychic activity in the dream:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n1. Theories, like those of Delb\xc5\x93uf,[16] which allow the full psychic\r\nactivity of the waking state to continue into the dream. Here the mind\r\ndoes not sleep; its apparatus remains intact, and, being placed under\r\nthe conditions different from the waking state, it must in normal\r\nactivity furnish results different from those of the waking state. In\r\nthese theories it is a question whether they are in position to derive\r\nthe distinctions between dreaming and waking thought altogether from the\r\ndeterminations of the sleeping state. They moreover lack a possible\r\naccess to a function of the dream; one cannot understand why one dreams,\r\nwhy the complicated mechanism of the psychic apparatus continues to play\r\neven when it is placed under conditions for which it is not apparently\r\nadapted. There remain only two expedient reactions\xe2\x80\x94to sleep dreamlessly\r\nor to awake when approached by disturbing stimuli\xe2\x80\x94instead of the third,\r\nthat of dreaming.\r\n\r\n2. Theories which, on the contrary, assume for the dream a diminution\r\nfor the psychic activity, a loosening of the connections, and an\r\nimpoverishment in available material. In accordance with these theories,\r\none must assume for sleep a psychological character entirely different\r\nfrom the one given by Delb\xc5\x93uf. Sleep extends far beyond the mind\xe2\x80\x94it does\r\nnot consist merely in a shutting off of the mind from the outer world;\r\non the contrary, it penetrates into its mechanism, causing it at times\r\nto become useless. If I may draw a comparison from psychiatrical\r\nmaterial, I may say that the first theories construct the dream like a\r\nparanoia, while the second make it after the model of a dementia or an\r\namentia.\r\n\r\nThe theory that only a fragment of the psychic activity paralysed by\r\nsleep comes to expression is by far the favourite among the medical\r\nwriters and in the scientific world. As far as one may presuppose a more\r\ngeneral interest in dream interpretation, it may well be designated as\r\nthe ruling theory of the dream. It is to be emphasized with what\r\nfacility this particular theory escapes the worst rock threatening every\r\ndream interpretation, that is to say, being shipwrecked upon one of the\r\ncontrasts embodied in the dream. As this theory considers the dream the\r\nresult of a partial waking (or as Herbart\xe2\x80\x99s _Psychology_ of the dream\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x9ca gradual, partial, and at the same time very anomalous waking\xe2\x80\x9d),\r\nit succeeds in covering the entire series of inferior activities in the\r\ndream which reveal themselves in its absurdities, up to the full\r\nconcentration of mental activity, by following a series of states which\r\nbecome more and more awake until they reach full awakening.\r\n\r\nOne who finds the psychological mode of expression indispensable, or who\r\nthinks more scientifically, will find this theory of the dream expressed\r\nin the discussion of Binz[4] (p. 43):\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis state [of numbness], however, gradually approaches its end in the\r\nearly morning hours. The accumulated material of fatigue in the albumen\r\nof the brain gradually becomes less. It is gradually decomposed or\r\ncarried away by the constantly flowing circulation. Here and there some\r\nmasses of cells can be distinguished as awake, while all around\r\neverything still remains in a state of torpidity. _The isolated work of\r\nthe individual groups_ now appears before our clouded consciousness,\r\nwhich lacks the control of other parts of the brain governing the\r\nassociations. Hence the pictures created, which mostly correspond to the\r\nobjective impressions of the recent past, fit with each other in a wild\r\nand irregular manner. The number of the brain cells set free becomes\r\nconstantly greater, the irrationality of the dream constantly less.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe conception of the dream as an incomplete, partial waking state, or\r\ntraces of its influence, can surely be found among all modern\r\nphysiologists and philosophers. It is most completely represented by\r\nMaury.[48] It often seems as if this author represented to himself the\r\nstate of being awake or asleep in anatomical regions; at any rate it\r\nappears to him that an anatomical province is connected with a definite\r\npsychic function. I may here merely mention that if the theory of\r\npartial waking could be confirmed, there would remain much to be\r\naccomplished in its elaboration.\r\n\r\nNaturally a function of the dream cannot be found in this conception of\r\nthe dream life. On the contrary, the criticism of the status and\r\nimportance of the dream is consistently uttered in this statement of\r\nBinz (p. 357): \xe2\x80\x9cAll the facts, as we see, urge us to characterise the\r\ndream as a physical process in all cases useless, in many cases even\r\nmorbid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe expression \xe2\x80\x9cphysical\xe2\x80\x9d in reference to the dream, which owes its\r\nprominence to this author, points in more than one direction. In the\r\nfirst place, it refers to the etiology of the dream, which was\r\nespecially clear to Binz, as he studied the experimental production of\r\ndreams by the administration of poisons. It is certainly in keeping with\r\nthis kind of dream theory to ascribe the incitement of the dream\r\nexclusively to somatic origin whenever possible. Presented in the most\r\nextreme form, it reads as follows: After we have put ourselves to sleep\r\nby removing the stimuli, there would be no need and no occasion for\r\ndreaming until morning, when the gradual awakening through the incoming\r\nstimuli would be reflected in the phenomenon of dreaming. But as a\r\nmatter of fact, it is not possible to keep sleep free from stimuli; just\r\nas Mephisto complains about the germs of life, so stimuli reach the\r\nsleeper from every side\xe2\x80\x94from without, from within, and even from certain\r\nbodily regions which never give us any concern during the waking state.\r\nThus sleep is disturbed; the mind is aroused, now by this, now by that\r\nlittle thing, and functionates for a while with the awakened part only\r\nto be glad to fall asleep again. The dream is a reaction to the stimulus\r\ncausing a disturbance of sleep\xe2\x80\x94to be sure, it is a purely superfluous\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\nTo designate the dream as a physical process, which for all that remains\r\nan activity of the mental organ, has still another sense. It is meant to\r\ndispute the dignity of a psychic process for the dream. The application\r\nto the dream of the very old comparison of the \xe2\x80\x9cten fingers of a\r\nmusically ignorant person running over the keyboard of an instrument,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nperhaps best illustrates in what estimation the dream activity has been\r\nheld by the representatives of exact science. In this sense it becomes\r\nsomething entirely untranslatable, for how could the ten fingers of an\r\nunmusical player produce any music?\r\n\r\nThe theory of partial wakefulness has not passed without objection even\r\nin early times. Thus Burdach,[8] in 1830, says: \xe2\x80\x9cIf we say that the\r\ndream is a partial wakefulness, in the first place, we explain thereby\r\nneither the waking nor the sleeping state; secondly, this expresses\r\nnothing more than that certain forces of the mind are active in the\r\ndream while others are at rest. But such irregularities take place\r\nthroughout life....\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 483).\r\n\r\nAmong extant dream theories which consider the dream a \xe2\x80\x9cphysical\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nprocess, there is one very interesting conception of the dream, first\r\npropounded by Robert[55] in 1866, which is attractive because it assigns\r\nto the dream a function or a useful end. As a basis for this theory,\r\nRobert takes from observation two facts which we have already discussed\r\nin our consideration of the dream material (see p. 13). These facts are:\r\nthat one very often dreams about the insignificant impressions of the\r\nday, and that one rarely carries over into the dream the absorbing\r\ninterests of the day. Robert asserts as exclusively correct, that things\r\nwhich have been fully settled never become dream inciters, but only such\r\nthings as are incomplete in the mind or touch it fleetingly (p. 11). \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\ncannot usually explain our dreams because their causes are to be found\r\n_in sensory impressions of the preceding day which have not attained\r\nsufficient recognition by the dreamer_.\xe2\x80\x9d The conditions allowing an\r\nimpression to reach the dream are therefore, either that this impression\r\nhas been disturbed in its elaboration, or that being too insignificant\r\nit has no claim to such elaboration.\r\n\r\nRobert therefore conceives the dream \xe2\x80\x9cas a physical process of\r\nelimination which has reached to cognition in the psychic manifestation\r\nof its reaction.\xe2\x80\x9d _Dreams are eliminations of thoughts nipped in the\r\nbud._ \xe2\x80\x9cA man deprived of the capacity for dreaming would surely in time\r\nbecome mentally unbalanced, because an immense number of unfinished and\r\nunsolved thoughts and superficial impressions would accumulate in his\r\nbrain, under the pressure of which there would be crushed all that\r\nshould be incorporated as a finished whole into memory.\xe2\x80\x9d The dream acts\r\nas a safety-valve for the overburdened brain. _Dreams possess healing\r\nand unburdening properties_ (p. 32).\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to ask Robert how representation in the dream can\r\nbring about an unburdening of the mind. The author apparently concluded\r\nfrom those two peculiarities of the dream material that during sleep\r\nsuch ejection of worthless impressions is effected as a somatic process,\r\nand that dreaming is not a special psychic process but only the\r\nknowledge that we receive of such elimination. To be sure an elimination\r\nis not the only thing that takes place in the mind during sleep. Robert\r\nhimself adds that the incitements of the day are also elaborated, and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat cannot be eliminated from the undigested thought material lying in\r\nthe mind becomes connected _by threads of thought borrowed from the\r\nphantasy into a finished whole_, and thus enrolled in the memory as a\r\nharmless phantasy picture\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 23).\r\n\r\nBut it is in his criticism of the dream sources that Robert appears most\r\nbluntly opposed to the ruling theory. Whereas according to the existing\r\ntheory there would be no dream if the outer and inner sensory stimuli\r\ndid not repeatedly wake the mind, according to Robert the impulse to\r\ndream lies in the mind itself. It lies in the overcharging which demands\r\ndischarge, and Robert judges with perfect consistency when he maintains\r\nthat the causes determining the dream which depend on the physical state\r\nassume a subordinate rank, and could not incite dreams in a mind\r\ncontaining no material for dream formation taken from waking\r\nconsciousness. It is admitted, however, that the phantasy pictures\r\noriginating in the depths of the mind can be influenced by the nervous\r\nstimuli (p. 48). Thus, according to Robert, the dream is not quite so\r\ndependent on the somatic element. To be sure, it is not a psychic\r\nprocess, and has no place among the psychic processes of the waking\r\nstate; it is a nocturnal somatic process in the apparatus devoted to\r\nmental activity, and has a function to perform, viz. to guard this\r\napparatus against overstraining, or, if the comparison may be changed,\r\nto cleanse the mind.\r\n\r\nAnother author, Yves Delage,[15] bases his theory on the same\r\ncharacteristics of the dream, which become clear in the selection of the\r\ndream material, and it is instructive to observe how a slight turn in\r\nthe conception of the same things gives a final result of quite\r\ndifferent bearing.\r\n\r\nDelage, after having lost through death a person very dear to him, found\r\nfrom his own experience that we do not dream of what occupies us\r\nintently during the day, or that we begin to dream of it only after it\r\nis overshadowed by other interests of the day. His investigations among\r\nother persons corroborated the universality of this state of affairs.\r\nDelage makes a nice observation of this kind, if it turns out to be\r\ngenerally true, about the dreaming of newly married people: \xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x99ils ont\r\n\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 fortement \xc3\xa9pris, presque jamais ils n\xe2\x80\x99ont r\xc3\xaave l\xe2\x80\x99un de l\xe2\x80\x99autre avant\r\nle mariage ou pendant la lune de miel; et s\xe2\x80\x99ils ont r\xc3\xaave d\xe2\x80\x99amour c\xe2\x80\x99est\r\npour \xc3\xaatre infid\xc3\xa8les avec quelque personne indiff\xc3\xa9rente ou odieuse.\xe2\x80\x9d But\r\nwhat does one dream of? Delage recognises that the material occurring in\r\nour dreams consists of fragments and remnants of impressions from the\r\ndays preceding and former times. All that appears in our dreams, what at\r\nfirst we may be inclined to consider creations of the dream life, proves\r\non more thorough investigation to be unrecognised reproductions,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csouvenir inconscient.\xe2\x80\x9d But this presentation material shows a common\r\ncharacter; it originates from impressions which have probably affected\r\nour senses more forcibly than our mind, or from which the attention has\r\nbeen deflected soon after their appearance. The less conscious, and at\r\nthe same time the stronger the impression, the more prospect it has of\r\nplaying a part in the next dream.\r\n\r\nThese are essentially the same two categories of impressions, the\r\ninsignificant and the unadjusted, which were emphasized by Robert,[55]\r\nbut Delage changes the connection by assuming that these impressions\r\nbecome the subject of dreams, not because they are indifferent, but\r\nbecause they are unadjusted. The insignificant impressions, too, are in\r\na way not fully adjusted; they, too, are from their nature as new\r\nimpressions \xe2\x80\x9cautant de ressorts tendus,\xe2\x80\x9d which will be relaxed during\r\nsleep. Still more entitled to a r\xc3\xb4le in the dream than the weak and\r\nalmost unnoticed impression is a strong impression which has been\r\naccidentally detained in its elaboration or intentionally repressed. The\r\npsychic energy accumulated during the day through inhibition or\r\nsuppression becomes the mainspring of the dream at night.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Delage stops here in his train of thought; he can ascribe\r\nonly the smallest part to an independent psychic activity in the dream,\r\nand thus in his dream theory reverts to the ruling doctrine of a partial\r\nsleep of the brain: \xe2\x80\x9cEn somme le r\xc3\xaave est le produit de la pens\xc3\xa9e\r\nerrante, sans but et sans direction, se fixant successivement sur les\r\nsouvenirs, qui ont gard\xc3\xa9 assez d\xe2\x80\x99intensit\xc3\xa9 pour se placer sur sa route\r\net l\xe2\x80\x99arr\xc3\xaater au passage, \xc3\xa9tablissant entre eux un lien tant\xc3\xb4t faible et\r\nind\xc3\xa9cis, tant\xc3\xb4t plus fort et plus serr\xc3\xa9, selon que l\xe2\x80\x99activit\xc3\xa9 actuelle\r\ndu cerveau est plus ou moins abolie par le sommeil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a third group we may include those dream theories which ascribe to\r\nthe dreaming mind the capacity and propensity for a special psychic\r\nactivity, which in the waking state it can accomplish either not at all\r\nor only in an imperfect manner. From the activity of these capacities\r\nthere usually results a useful function of the dream. The dignity\r\nbestowed upon the dream by older psychological authors falls chiefly in\r\nthis category. I shall content myself, however, with quoting, in their\r\nplace, the assertions of Burdach,[8] by virtue of which the dream \xe2\x80\x9cis\r\nthe natural activity of the mind, which is not limited by the force of\r\nthe individuality, not disturbed by self-consciousness and not directed\r\nby self-determination, but is the state of life of the sensible central\r\npoint indulging in free play\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 486).\r\n\r\nBurdach and others apparently consider this revelling in the free use of\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s own powers as a state in which the mind refreshes itself and takes\r\non new strength for the day work, something after the manner of a\r\nvacation holiday. Burdach, therefore, cites with approval the admirable\r\nwords in which the poet Novalis lauds the sway of the dream: \xe2\x80\x9cThe dream\r\nis a bulwark against the regularity and commonness of life, a free\r\nrecreation of the fettered phantasy, in which it mixes together all the\r\npictures of life and interrupts the continued earnestness of grown-up\r\nmen with a joyous children\xe2\x80\x99s play. Without the dream we should surely\r\nage earlier, and thus the dream may be considered perhaps not a gift\r\ndirectly from above, but a delightful task, a friendly companion, on our\r\npilgrimage to the grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe refreshing and curative activity of the dream is even more\r\nimpressively depicted by Purkinje.[53] \xe2\x80\x9cThe productive dreams in\r\nparticular would perform these functions. They are easy plays of the\r\nimagination, which have no connection with the events of the day. The\r\nmind does not wish to continue the tension of the waking life, but to\r\nrelease it and recuperate from it. It produces, in the first place,\r\nconditions opposed to those of the waking state. It cures sadness\r\nthrough joy, worry through hope and cheerfully distracting pictures,\r\nhatred through love and friendliness, and fear through courage and\r\nconfidence; it calms doubt through conviction and firm belief, and vain\r\nexpectations through realisation. Many sore spots in the mind, which the\r\nday keeps continually open, sleep heals by covering them and guarding\r\nagainst fresh excitement. Upon this the curative effect of time is\r\npartially based.\xe2\x80\x9d We all feel that sleep is beneficial to the psychic\r\nlife, and the vague surmise of the popular consciousness apparently\r\ncannot be robbed of the notion that the dream is one of the ways in\r\nwhich sleep distributes its benefits.\r\n\r\nThe most original and most far-reaching attempt to explain the dream as\r\na special activity of the mind, which can freely display itself only in\r\nthe sleeping state, was the one undertaken by Scherner[58] in 1861.\r\nScherner\xe2\x80\x99s book, written in a heavy and bombastic style, inspired by an\r\nalmost intoxicated enthusiasm for the subject, which must repel us\r\nunless it can carry us away with it, places so many difficulties in the\r\nway of an analysis that we gladly resort to the clearer and shorter\r\ndescription in which the philosopher Volkelt[72] presents Scherner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntheories: \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the mystic conglomerations and from all the gorgeous and\r\nmagnificent billows there indeed flashes and irradiates an ominous light\r\nof sense, but the path of the philosopher does not thereby become\r\nclearer.\xe2\x80\x9d Such is the criticism of Scherner\xe2\x80\x99s description from one of\r\nhis own adherents.\r\n\r\nScherner does not belong to those authors who allow the mind to take\r\nalong its undiminished capacities into the dream life. He indeed\r\nexplains how in the dream the centrality and the spontaneous energy of\r\nthe ego are enervated, how cognition, feeling, will, and imagination\r\nbecome changed through this decentralisation, and how no true mental\r\ncharacter, but only the nature of a mechanism, belongs to the remnants\r\nof these psychic forces. But instead, the activity of the mind\r\ndesignated as phantasy, freed from all rational domination and hence\r\ncompletely uncontrolled, rises in the dream to absolute supremacy. To be\r\nsure, it takes the last building stones from the memory of the waking\r\nstate, but it builds with them constructions as different from the\r\nstructures of the waking state as day and night. It shows itself in the\r\ndream not only reproductive, but productive. Its peculiarities give to\r\nthe dream life its strange character. It shows a preference for the\r\nunlimited, exaggerated, and prodigious, but because freed from the\r\nimpeding thought categories, it gains a greater flexibility and agility\r\nand new pleasure; it is extremely sensitive to the delicate emotional\r\nstimuli of the mind and to the agitating affects, and it rapidly recasts\r\nthe inner life into the outer plastic clearness. The dream phantasy\r\nlacks the language of ideas; what it wishes to say, it must clearly\r\ndepict; and as the idea now acts strongly, it depicts it with the\r\nrichness, force, and immensity of the mode in question. Its language,\r\nhowever simple it may be, thus becomes circumstantial, cumbersome, and\r\nheavy. Clearness of language is rendered especially difficult by the\r\nfact that it shows a dislike for expressing an object by its own\r\npicture, but prefers a strange picture, if the latter can only express\r\nthat moment of the object which it wishes to describe. This is the\r\nsymbolising activity of the phantasy.... It is, moreover, of great\r\nsignificance that the dream phantasy copies objects not in detail, but\r\nonly in outline and even this in the broadest manner. Its paintings,\r\ntherefore, appear ingeniously light and graceful. The dream phantasy,\r\nhowever, does not stop at the mere representation of the object, but is\r\nimpelled from within to mingle with the object more or less of the dream\r\nego, and in this way to produce an action. The visual dream, _e.g._,\r\ndepicts gold coins in the street; the dreamer picks them up, rejoices,\r\nand carries them away.\r\n\r\nAccording to Scherner, the material upon which the dream phantasy exerts\r\nits artistic activity is preponderately that of the organic sensory\r\nstimuli which are so obscure during the day (comp. p. 29); hence the\r\nphantastic theory of Scherner, and the perhaps over-sober theories of\r\nWundt and other physiologists, though otherwise diametrically opposed,\r\nagree perfectly in their assumption of the dream sources and dream\r\nexcitants. But whereas, according to the physiological theory, the\r\npsychic reaction to the inner physical stimuli becomes exhausted with\r\nthe awakening of any ideas suitable to these stimuli, these ideas then\r\nby way of association calling to their aid other ideas, and with this\r\nstage the chain of psychic processes seeming to terminate according to\r\nScherner, the physical stimuli only supply the psychic force with a\r\nmaterial which it may render subservient to its phantastic intentions.\r\nFor Scherner the formation of the dream only commences where in the\r\nconception of others it comes to an end.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the physical stimuli by the dream phantasy surely\r\ncannot be considered purposeful. The phantasy plays a tantalising game\r\nwith them, and represents the organic source which gives origin to the\r\nstimuli in the correspondent dream, in any plastic symbolism. Indeed\r\nScherner holds the opinion, not shared by Volkelt and others, that the\r\ndream phantasy has a certain favourite representation for the entire\r\norganism; this representation would be the _house_. Fortunately,\r\nhowever, it does not seem to limit itself in its presentation to this\r\nmaterial; it may also conversely employ a whole series of houses to\r\ndesignate a single organ, _e.g._, very long rows of houses for the\r\nintestinal excitation. On other occasions particular parts of the house\r\nactually represent particular parts of the body, as _e.g._, in the\r\nheadache-dream, the ceiling of the room (which the dream sees covered\r\nwith disgusting reptile-like spiders) represents the head.\r\n\r\nQuite irrespective of the house symbolism, any other suitable object may\r\nbe employed for the representation of these parts of the body which\r\nexcite the dream. \xe2\x80\x9cThus the breathing lungs find their symbol in the\r\nflaming stove with its gaseous roaring, the heart in hollow boxes and\r\nbaskets, the bladder in round, bag-shaped, or simply hollowed objects.\r\nThe male dream of sexual excitement makes the dreamer find in the street\r\nthe upper portion of a clarinette, next to it the same part of a tobacco\r\npipe, and next to that a piece of fur. The clarinette and tobacco pipe\r\nrepresent the approximate shape of the male sexual organ, while the fur\r\nrepresents the pubic hair. In the female sexual dream the tightness of\r\nthe closely approximated thighs may be symbolised by a narrow courtyard\r\nsurrounded by houses, and the vagina by a very narrow, slippery and soft\r\nfootpath, leading through the courtyard, upon which the dreamer is\r\nobliged to walk, in order perhaps to carry a letter to a gentleman\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(Volkelt, p. 39). It is particularly noteworthy that at the end of such\r\na physically exciting dream, the phantasy, as it were, unmasks by\r\nrepresenting the exciting organ or its function unconcealed. Thus the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctooth-exciting dream\xe2\x80\x9d usually ends with the dreamer taking a tooth out\r\nof his mouth.\r\n\r\nThe dream phantasy may, however, not only direct its attention to the\r\nshape of the exciting organ, but it may also make the substance\r\ncontained therein the object of the symbolisation. Thus the dream of\r\nintestinal excitement, _e.g._, may lead us through muddy streets, the\r\nbladder-exciting dream to foaming water. Or the stimulus itself, the\r\nmanner of its excitation, and the object it covets, are represented\r\nsymbolically, or the dream ego enters into a concrete combination with\r\nthe symbolisation of its own state, as _e.g._, when, in the case of\r\npainful stimuli, we struggle desperately with vicious dogs or raging\r\nbulls, or when in the sexual dream the dreamer sees herself pursued by a\r\nnaked man. Disregarding all the possible prolixity of elaboration, a\r\nsymbolising phantastic activity remains as the central force of every\r\ndream. Volkelt,[72] in his finely and fervently written book, next\r\nattempted to penetrate further into the character of this phantasy and\r\nto assign to the psychical activity thus recognised, its position in a\r\nsystem of philosophical ideas, which, however, remains altogether too\r\ndifficult of comprehension for any one who is not prepared by previous\r\nschooling for the sympathetic comprehension of philosophical modes of\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\nScherner connects no useful function with the activity of the\r\nsymbolising phantasy in dreams. In the dream the psyche plays with the\r\nstimuli at its disposal. One might presume that it plays in an improper\r\nmanner. One might also ask us whether our thorough study of Scherner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndream theory, the arbitrariness and deviation of which from the rules of\r\nall investigation are only too obvious, can lead to any useful results.\r\nIt would then be proper for us to forestall the rejection of Scherner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntheory without examination by saying that this would be too arrogant.\r\nThis theory is built up on the impression received from his dreams by a\r\nman who paid great attention to them, and who would appear to be\r\npersonally very well fitted to trace obscure psychic occurrences.\r\nFurthermore it treats a subject which, for thousands of years, has\r\nappeared mysterious to humanity though rich in its contents and\r\nrelations; and for the elucidation of which stern science, as it\r\nconfesses itself, has contributed nothing beyond attempting, in entire\r\nopposition to popular sentiment, to deny the substance and significance\r\nof the object. Finally, let us frankly admit that apparently we cannot\r\navoid the phantastical in our attempts to elucidate the dream. There are\r\nalso phantastic ganglia cells; the passage cited on p. 63 from a sober\r\nand exact investigator like Binz,[4] which depicts how the aurora of\r\nawakening flows along the dormant cell masses of the cerebrum, is not\r\ninferior in fancifulness and in improbability to Scherner\xe2\x80\x99s attempts at\r\ninterpretation. I hope to be able to demonstrate that there is something\r\nactual underlying the latter, though it has only been indistinctly\r\nobserved and does not possess the character of universality entitling it\r\nto the claim of a dream theory. For the present, Scherner\xe2\x80\x99s theory of\r\nthe dream, in its contrast to the medical theory, may perhaps lead us to\r\nrealise between what extremes the explanation of dream life is still\r\nunsteadily vacillating.\r\n\r\n(_h_) _Relations between the Dream and Mental Diseases._\xe2\x80\x94When we speak\r\nof the relation of the dream to mental disturbances, we may think of\r\nthree different things: (1) Etiological and clinical relations, as when\r\na dream represents or initiates a psychotic condition, or when it leaves\r\nsuch a condition behind it. (2) Changes to which the dream life is\r\nsubjected in mental diseases. (3) Inner relations between the dream and\r\nthe psychoses, analogies indicating an intimate relationship. These\r\nmanifold relations between the two series of phenomena have been a\r\nfavourite theme of medical authors in the earlier periods of medical\r\nscience\xe2\x80\x94and again in recent times\xe2\x80\x94as we learn from the literature on the\r\nsubject gathered from Spitta,[64] Radestock,[54] Maury,[48] and\r\nTissi\xc3\xa9.[68] Sante de Sanctis has lately directed his attention to this\r\nrelationship. For the purposes of our discussion it will suffice merely\r\nto glance at this important subject.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the clinical and etiological relations between the dream\r\nand the psychoses, I will report the following observations as\r\nparadigms. Hohnbaum asserts (see Krauss, p. 39), that the first attack\r\nof insanity frequently originates in an anxious and terrifying dream,\r\nand that the ruling idea has connection with this dream. Sante de\r\nSanctis adduces similar observations in paranoiacs, and declares the\r\ndream to be, in some of them, the \xe2\x80\x9cvraie cause d\xc3\xa9terminante de la\r\nfolie.\xe2\x80\x9d The psychosis may come to life all of a sudden with the dream\r\ncausing and containing the explanation for the mental disturbances, or\r\nit may slowly develop through further dreams that have yet to struggle\r\nagainst doubt. In one of de Sanctis\xe2\x80\x99s cases, the affecting dream was\r\naccompanied by light hysterical attacks, which in their turn were\r\nfollowed by an anxious, melancholic state. F\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9 (cited by Tissi\xc3\xa9) refers\r\nto a dream which caused an hysterical paralysis. Here the dream is\r\noffered us as an etiology of mental disturbance, though we equally\r\nconsider the prevailing conditions when we declare that the mental\r\ndisturbance shows its first manifestation in dream life, that it has its\r\nfirst outbreak in the dream. In other instances the dream life contained\r\nthe morbid symptoms, or the psychosis was limited to the dream life.\r\nThus Thomayer[70] calls attention to anxiety dreams which must be\r\nconceived as equivalent to epileptic attacks. Allison has described\r\nnocturnal insanity (cited by Radestock), in which the subjects are\r\napparently perfectly well in the day-time, while hallucinations, fits of\r\nfrenzy, and the like regularly appear at night. De Sanctis and Tissi\xc3\xa9\r\nreport similar observations (paranoiac dream-equivalent in an alcoholic,\r\nvoices accusing a wife of infidelity). Tissi\xc3\xa9 reports abundant\r\nobservations from recent times in which actions of a pathological\r\ncharacter (based on delusions, obsessive impulses) had their origin in\r\ndreams. Guislain describes a case in which sleep was replaced by an\r\nintermittent insanity.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly any doubt that along with the psychology of the dream,\r\nthe physician will one day occupy himself with the psychopathology of\r\nthe dream.\r\n\r\nIn cases of convalescence from insanity, it is often especially obvious\r\nthat, while the functions of the day are normal, the dream life may\r\nstill belong to the psychosis. Gregory is said first to have called\r\nattention to such cases (cited by Krauss[39]). Macario (reported by\r\nTissi\xc3\xa9) gives account of a maniac who, a week after his complete\r\nrecovery again experienced in dreams the flight of ideas and the\r\npassionate impulses of his disease.\r\n\r\nConcerning the changes to which the dream life is subjected in chronic\r\npsychotic persons, very few investigations have so far been made. On the\r\nother hand, timely attention has been called to the inner relationship\r\nbetween the dream and mental disturbance, which shows itself in an\r\nextensive agreement of the manifestations occurring to both. According\r\nto Maury,[47] Cubanis, in his _Rapports du physique et du moral_, first\r\ncalled attention to this; following him came Lelut, J. Moreau, and more\r\nparticularly the philosopher Maine de Biran. To be sure, the comparison\r\nis still older. Radestock[54] begins the chapter dealing with this\r\ncomparison, by giving a collection of expressions showing the analogy\r\nbetween the dream and insanity. Kant somewhere says: \xe2\x80\x9cThe lunatic is a\r\ndreamer in the waking state.\xe2\x80\x9d According to Krauss \xe2\x80\x9cInsanity is a dream\r\nwith the senses awake.\xe2\x80\x9d Schopenhauer terms the dream a short insanity,\r\nand insanity a long dream. Hagen describes the delirium as dream life\r\nwhich has not been caused by sleep but by disease. Wundt, in the\r\n_Physiological Psychology_, declares: \xe2\x80\x9cAs a matter of fact we may in the\r\ndream ourselves live through almost all symptoms which we meet in the\r\ninsane asylums.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe specific agreements, on the basis of which such an identification\r\ncommends itself to the understanding, are enumerated by Spitta.[64] And\r\nindeed, very similarly, by Maury in the following grouping: \xe2\x80\x9c(1)\r\nSuspension or at least retardation, of self-consciousness, consequent\r\nignorance of the condition as such, and hence incapability of\r\nastonishment and lack of moral consciousness. (2) Modified perception of\r\nthe sensory organs; that is, perception is diminished in the dream and\r\ngenerally enhanced in insanity. (3) Combination of ideas with each other\r\nexclusively in accordance with the laws of association and of\r\nreproduction, hence automatic formation of groups and for this reason\r\ndisproportion in the relations between ideas (exaggerations, phantasms).\r\nAnd as a result of all this: (4) Changing or transformation of the\r\npersonality and at times of the peculiarities of character\r\n(perversities).\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRadestock gives some additional features or analogies in the material:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost hallucinations and illusions are found in the sphere of the senses\r\nof sight and hearing and general sensation. As in the dream, the\r\nsmallest number of elements is supplied by the senses of smell and\r\ntaste. The fever patient, like the dreamer, is assaulted by\r\nreminiscences from the remote past; what the waking and healthy man\r\nseems to have forgotten is recollected in sleep and in disease.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nanalogy between the dream and the psychosis receives its full value only\r\nwhen, like a family resemblance, it is extended to the finer mimicry and\r\nto the individual peculiarities of facial expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo him who is tortured by physical and mental sufferings the dream\r\naccords what has been denied him by reality, to wit, physical well-being\r\nand happiness; so the insane, too, see the bright pictures of happiness,\r\ngreatness, sublimity, and riches. The supposed possession of estates and\r\nthe imaginary fulfilment of wishes, the denial or destruction of which\r\nhave just served as a psychic cause of the insanity, often form the main\r\ncontent of the delirium. The woman who has lost a dearly beloved child,\r\nin her delirium experiences maternal joys; the man who has suffered\r\nreverses of fortune deems himself immensely wealthy; and the jilted girl\r\npictures herself in the bliss of tender love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe above passage from Radestock, an abstract of a keen discussion of\r\nGriesinger[31] (p. 111), reveals with the greatest clearness the wish\r\nfulfilment as a characteristic of the imagination, common to the dream\r\nand the psychosis. (My own investigations have taught me that here the\r\nkey to a psychological theory of the dream and of the psychosis is to be\r\nfound.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsurd combinations of ideas and weakness of judgment are the main\r\ncharacteristics of the dream and of insanity.\xe2\x80\x9d The over-estimation of\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s own mental capacity, which appears absurd to sober judgment, is\r\nfound alike both in one and the other, and the rapid course of ideas in\r\nthe dream corresponds to the flight of ideas in the psychosis. Both are\r\ndevoid of any measure of time. The dissociation of personality in the\r\ndream, which, for instance, distributes one\xe2\x80\x99s own knowledge between two\r\npersons, one of whom, the strange one, corrects in the dream one\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nego, fully corresponds to the well-known splitting of personality in\r\nhallucinatory paranoia; the dreamer, too, hears his own thoughts\r\nexpressed by strange voices. Even the constant delusions find their\r\nanalogy in the stereotyped recurring pathological dreams (_r\xc3\xaave\r\nobs\xc3\xa9dant_). After recovering from a delirium, patients not infrequently\r\ndeclare that the disease appeared to them like an uncomfortable dream;\r\nindeed, they inform us that occasionally, even during the course of\r\ntheir sickness, they have felt that they were only dreaming, just as it\r\nfrequently happens in the sleeping dream.\r\n\r\nConsidering all this, it is not surprising that Radestock condenses his\r\nown opinion and that of many others into the following: \xe2\x80\x9cInsanity, an\r\nabnormal phenomenon of disease, is to be regarded as an enhancement of\r\nthe periodically recurring normal dream states\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 228).\r\n\r\nKrauss[39] attempted to base the relationship between the dream and\r\ninsanity upon the etiology (or rather upon the exciting sources),\r\nperhaps making the relationship even more intimate than was possible\r\nthrough the analogy of the phenomena they manifest. According to him,\r\nthe fundamental element common to both is, as we have learned, the\r\norganically determined sensation, the sensation of physical stimuli, the\r\ngeneral feeling produced by contributions from all the organs. _Cf._\r\nPeise, cited by Maury[48] (p. 60).\r\n\r\nThe incontestable agreement between the dream and mental disturbance,\r\nextending into characteristic details, constitutes one of the strongest\r\nsupports of the medical theory of dream life, according to which the\r\ndream is represented as a useless and disturbing process and as the\r\nexpression of a reduced psychic activity. One cannot expect, however, to\r\nderive the final explanation of the dream from the mental disturbances,\r\nas it is generally known in what unsatisfactory state our understanding\r\nof the origin of the latter remains. It is very probably, however, that\r\na modified conception of the dream must also influence our views in\r\nregard to the inner mechanism of mental disturbances, and hence we may\r\nsay that we are engaged in the elucidation of the psychosis when we\r\nendeavour to clear up the mystery of the dream.\r\n\r\nI shall have to justify myself for not extending my summary of the\r\nliterature of the dream problems over the period between the first\r\nappearance of this book and its second edition. If this justification\r\nmay not seem very satisfactory to the reader, I was nevertheless\r\ninfluenced by it. The motives which mainly induced me to summarise the\r\ntreatment of the dream in the literature have been exhausted with the\r\nforegoing introduction; to have continued with this work would have cost\r\nme extraordinary effort and would have afforded little advantage or\r\nknowledge. For the period of nine years referred to has yielded nothing\r\nnew or valuable either for the conception of the dream in actual\r\nmaterial or in points of view. In most of the publications that have\r\nsince appeared my work has remained unmentioned and unregarded;\r\nnaturally least attention has been bestowed upon it by the so-called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cinvestigators of dreams,\xe2\x80\x9d who have thus afforded a splendid example of\r\nthe aversion characteristic of scientific men to learning something new.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLes savants ne sont pas curieux,\xe2\x80\x9d said the scoffer Anatole France. If\r\nthere were such a thing in science as right to revenge, I in turn should\r\nbe justified in ignoring the literature since the appearance of this\r\nbook. The few accounts that have appeared in scientific journals are so\r\nfull of folly and misconception that my only possible answer to my\r\ncritics would be to request them to read this book over again. Perhaps\r\nalso the request should be that they read it as a whole.\r\n\r\nIn the works of those physicians who make use of the psychoanalytic\r\nmethod of treatment (Jung, Abraham, Riklin, Muthmann, Stekel, Rank, and\r\nothers), an abundance of dreams have been reported and interpreted in\r\naccordance with my instructions. In so far as these works go beyond the\r\nconfirmation of my assertions I have noted their results in the context\r\nof my discussion. A supplement to the literary index at the end of this\r\nbook brings together the most important of these new publications. The\r\nvoluminous book on the dream by Sante de Sanctis, of which a German\r\ntranslation appeared soon after its publication, has, so to speak,\r\ncrossed with mine, so that I could take as little notice of him as the\r\nItalian author could of me. Unfortunately, I am further obliged to\r\ndeclare that this laborious work is exceedingly poor in ideas, so poor\r\nthat one could never divine from it the existence of the problems\r\ntreated by me.\r\n\r\nI have finally to mention two publications which show a near relation to\r\nmy treatment of the dream problems. A younger philosopher, H. Swoboda,\r\nwho has undertaken to extend W. Fliesse\xe2\x80\x99s discovery of biological\r\nperiodicity (in groups of twenty-three and twenty-eight days) to the\r\npsychic field, has produced an imaginative work,[P] in which, among\r\nother things, he has used this key to solve the riddle of the dream. The\r\ninterpretation of dreams would herein have fared badly; the material\r\ncontained in dreams would be explained through the coincidence of all\r\nthose memories which during the night complete one of the biological\r\nperiods for the first or the n-th time. A personal statement from the\r\nauthor led me to assume that he himself no longer wished to advocate\r\nthis theory earnestly. But it seems I was mistaken in this conclusion; I\r\nshall report in another place some observations in reference to\r\nSwoboda\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, concerning the conclusions of which I am, however,\r\nnot convinced. It gave me far greater pleasure to find accidentally, in\r\nan unexpected place, a conception of the dream in essentials fully\r\nagreeing with my own. The circumstances of time preclude the possibility\r\nthat this conception was influenced by a reading of my book; I must\r\ntherefore greet this as the only demonstrable concurrence in the\r\nliterature with the essence of my dream theory. The book which contains\r\nthe passage concerning the dream which I have in mind was published as a\r\nsecond edition in 1900 by Lynkus under the title _Phantasien eines\r\nRealisten_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n                     METHOD OF DREAM INTERPRETATION\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE ANALYSIS OF A SAMPLE DREAM\r\n\r\nThe title which I have given my treatise indicates the tradition which I\r\nwish to make the starting-point in my discussion of dreams. I have made\r\nit my task to show that dreams are capable of interpretation, and\r\ncontributions to the solution of the dream problems that have just been\r\ntreated can only be yielded as possible by-products of the settlement of\r\nmy own particular problem. With the hypothesis that dreams are\r\ninterpretable, I at once come into contradiction with the prevailing\r\ndream science, in fact with all dream theories except that of Scherner,\r\nfor to \xe2\x80\x9cinterpret a dream\xe2\x80\x9d means to declare its meaning, to replace it\r\nby something which takes its place in the concatenation of our psychic\r\nactivities as a link of full importance and value. But, as we have\r\nlearnt, the scientific theories of the dream leave no room for a problem\r\nof dream interpretation, for, in the first place, according to these,\r\nthe dream is no psychic action, but a somatic process which makes itself\r\nknown to the psychic apparatus by means of signs. The opinion of the\r\nmasses has always been quite different. It asserts its privilege of\r\nproceeding illogically, and although it admits the dream to be\r\nincomprehensible and absurd, it cannot summon the resolution to deny the\r\ndream all significance. Led by a dim intuition, it seems rather to\r\nassume that the dream has a meaning, albeit a hidden one; that it is\r\nintended as a substitute for some other thought process, and that it is\r\nonly a question of revealing this substitute correctly in order to reach\r\nthe hidden signification of the dream.\r\n\r\nThe laity has, therefore, always endeavoured to \xe2\x80\x9cinterpret\xe2\x80\x9d the dream,\r\nand in doing so has tried two essentially different methods. The first\r\nof these procedures regards the dream content as a whole and seeks to\r\nreplace it by another content which is intelligible and in certain\r\nrespects analogous. This is symbolic dream interpretation; it naturally\r\ngoes to pieces at the outset in the case of those dreams which appear\r\nnot only unintelligible but confused. The construction which the\r\nbiblical Joseph places upon the dream of Pharaoh furnishes an example of\r\nits procedure. The seven fat kine, after which came seven lean ones\r\nwhich devour the former, furnish a symbolic substitute for a prediction\r\nof seven years of famine in the land of Egypt, which will consume all\r\nthe excess which seven fruitful years have created. Most of the\r\nartificial dreams contrived by poets are intended for such symbolic\r\ninterpretation, for they reproduce the thought conceived by the poet in\r\na disguise found to be in accordance with the characteristics of our\r\ndreaming, as we know these from experience.[Q] The idea that the dream\r\nconcerns itself chiefly with future events whose course it surmises in\r\nadvance\xe2\x80\x94a relic of the prophetic significance with which dreams were\r\nonce credited\xe2\x80\x94now becomes the motive for transplanting the meaning of\r\nthe dream, found by means of symbolic interpretation, into the future by\r\nmeans of an \xe2\x80\x9cit shall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA demonstration of the way in which such symbolic interpretation is\r\narrived at cannot, of course, be given. Success remains a matter of\r\ningenious conjecture, of direct intuition, and for this reason dream\r\ninterpretation has naturally been elevated to an art, which seems to\r\ndepend upon extraordinary gifts.[R] The other of the two popular methods\r\nof dream interpretation entirely abandons such claims. It might be\r\ndesignated as the \xe2\x80\x9ccipher method,\xe2\x80\x9d since it treats the dream as a kind\r\nof secret code, in which every sign is translated into another sign of\r\nknown meaning, according to an established key. For example, I have\r\ndreamt of a letter, and also of a funeral or the like; I consult a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdream book,\xe2\x80\x9d and find that \xe2\x80\x9cletter\xe2\x80\x9d is to be translated by \xe2\x80\x9cvexation,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cfuneral\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cmarriage, engagement.\xe2\x80\x9d It now remains to establish a\r\nconnection, which I again am to assume pertains to the future, by means\r\nof the rigmarole which I have deciphered. An interesting variation of\r\nthis cipher procedure, a variation by which its character of purely\r\nmechanical transference is to a certain extent corrected, is presented\r\nin the work on dream interpretation by Artemidoros of Daldis.[2] Here\r\nnot only the dream content, but also the personality and station in life\r\nof the dreamer, are taken into consideration, so that the same dream\r\ncontent has a significance for the rich man, the married man, or the\r\norator, which is different from that for the poor man, the unmarried\r\nman, or, say, the merchant. The essential point, then, in this procedure\r\nis that the work of interpretation is not directed to the entirety of\r\nthe dream, but to each portion of the dream content by itself, as though\r\nthe dream were a conglomeration, in which each fragment demands a\r\nparticular disposal. Incoherent and confused dreams are certainly the\r\nones responsible for the invention of the cipher method.[S]\r\n\r\nThe worthlessness of both these popular interpretation procedures for\r\nthe scientific treatment of the subject cannot be questioned for a\r\nmoment. The symbolic method is limited in its application and is capable\r\nof no general demonstration. In the cipher method everything depends\r\nupon whether the key, the dream book, is reliable, and for that all\r\nguarantees are lacking. One might be tempted to grant the contention of\r\nthe philosophers and psychiatrists and to dismiss the problem of dream\r\ninterpretation as a fanciful one.\r\n\r\nI have come, however, to think differently. I have been forced to admit\r\nthat here once more we have one of those not infrequent cases where an\r\nancient and stubbornly retained popular belief seems to have come nearer\r\nto the truth of the matter than the judgment of the science which\r\nprevails to-day. I must insist that the dream actually has significance,\r\nand that a scientific procedure in dream interpretation is possible. I\r\nhave come upon the knowledge of this procedure in the following manner:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nFor several years I have been occupied with the solution of certain\r\npsychopathological structures in hysterical phobias, compulsive ideas,\r\nand the like, for therapeutic purposes. I have been so occupied since\r\nbecoming familiar with an important report of Joseph Breuer to the\r\neffect that in those structures, regarded as morbid symptoms, solution\r\nand treatment go hand in hand.[T] Where it has been possible to trace\r\nsuch a pathological idea back to the elements in the psychic life of the\r\npatient to which it owes its origin, this idea has crumbled away, and\r\nthe patient has been relieved of it. In view of the failure of our other\r\ntherapeutic efforts, and in the face of the mysteriousness of these\r\nconditions, it seems to me tempting, in spite of all difficulties, to\r\npress forward on the path taken by Breuer until the subject has been\r\nfully understood. We shall have elsewhere to make a detailed report upon\r\nthe form which the technique of this procedure has finally assumed, and\r\nthe results of the efforts which have been made. In the course of these\r\npsychoanalytical studies, I happened upon dream interpretation. My\r\npatients, after I had obliged them to inform me of all the ideas and\r\nthoughts which came to them in connection with the given theme, related\r\ntheir dreams, and thus taught me that a dream may be linked into the\r\npsychic concatenation which must be followed backwards into the memory\r\nfrom the pathological idea as a starting-point. The next step was to\r\ntreat the dream as a symptom, and to apply to it the method of\r\ninterpretation which had been worked out for such symptoms.\r\n\r\nFor this a certain psychic preparation of the patient is necessary. The\r\ndouble effort is made with him, to stimulate his attention for his\r\npsychic perceptions and to eliminate the critique with which he is\r\nordinarily in the habit of viewing the thoughts which come to the\r\nsurface in him. For the purpose of self-observation with concentrated\r\nattention, it is advantageous that the patient occupy a restful position\r\nand close his eyes; he must be explicitly commanded to resign the\r\ncritique of the thought-formations which he perceives. He must be told\r\nfurther that the success of the psychoanalysis depends upon his noticing\r\nand telling everything that passes through his mind, and that he must\r\nnot allow himself to suppress one idea because it seems to him\r\nunimportant or irrelevant to the subject, or another because it seems\r\nnonsensical. He must maintain impartiality towards his ideas; for it\r\nwould be owing to just this critique if he were unsuccessful in finding\r\nthe desired solution of the dream, the obsession, or the like.\r\n\r\nI have noticed in the course of my psychoanalytic work that the state of\r\nmind of a man in contemplation is entirely different from that of a man\r\nwho is observing his psychic processes. In contemplation there is a\r\ngreater play of psychic action than in the most attentive\r\nself-observation; this is also shown by the tense attitude and wrinkled\r\nbrow of contemplation, in contrast with the restful features of\r\nself-observation. In both cases, there must be concentration of\r\nattention, but, besides this, in contemplation one exercises a critique,\r\nin consequence of which he rejects some of the ideas which he has\r\nperceived, and cuts short others, so that he does not follow the trains\r\nof thought which they would open; toward still other thoughts he may act\r\nin such a manner that they do not become conscious at all\xe2\x80\x94that is to\r\nsay, they are suppressed before they are perceived. In self-observation,\r\non the other hand, one has only the task of suppressing the critique; if\r\nhe succeeds in this, an unlimited number of ideas, which otherwise would\r\nhave been impossible for him to grasp, come to his consciousness. With\r\nthe aid of this material, newly secured for the purpose of\r\nself-observation, the interpretation of pathological ideas, as well as\r\nof dream images, can be accomplished. As may be seen, the point is to\r\nbring about a psychic state to some extent analogous as regards the\r\napportionment of psychic energy (transferable attention) to the state\r\nprior to falling asleep (and indeed also to the hypnotic state). In\r\nfalling asleep, the \xe2\x80\x9cundesired ideas\xe2\x80\x9d come into prominence on account of\r\nthe slackening of a certain arbitrary (and certainly also critical)\r\naction, which we allow to exert an influence upon the trend of our\r\nideas; we are accustomed to assign \xe2\x80\x9cfatigue\xe2\x80\x9d as the reason for this\r\nslackening; the emerging undesired ideas as the reason are changed into\r\nvisual and acoustic images. (_Cf._ the remarks of Schleiermacher[61] and\r\nothers, p. 40.) In the condition which is used for the analysis of\r\ndreams and pathological ideas, this activity is purposely and\r\narbitrarily dispensed with, and the psychic energy thus saved, or a part\r\nof it, is used for the attentive following of the undesired thoughts now\r\ncoming to the surface, which retain their identity as ideas (this is the\r\ndifference from the condition of falling asleep). \xe2\x80\x9cUndesired ideas\xe2\x80\x9d are\r\nthus changed into \xe2\x80\x9cdesired\xe2\x80\x9d ones.\r\n\r\nThe suspension thus required of the critique for these apparently\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfreely rising\xe2\x80\x9d ideas, which is here demanded and which is usually\r\nexercised on them, is not easy for some persons. The \xe2\x80\x9cundesired ideas\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nare in the habit of starting the most violent resistance, which seeks to\r\nprevent them from coming to the surface. But if we may credit our great\r\npoet-philosopher Friedrich Schiller, a very similar tolerance must be\r\nthe condition of poetic production. At a point in his correspondence\r\nwith Koerner, for the noting of which we are indebted to Mr. Otto Rank,\r\nSchiller answers a friend who complains of his lack of creativeness in\r\nthe following words: \xe2\x80\x9cThe reason for your complaint lies, it seems to\r\nme, in the constraint which your intelligence imposes upon your\r\nimagination. I must here make an observation and illustrate it by an\r\nallegory. It does not seem beneficial, and it is harmful for the\r\ncreative work of the mind, if the intelligence inspects too closely the\r\nideas already pouring in, as it were, at the gates. Regarded by itself,\r\nan idea may be very trifling and very adventurous, but it perhaps\r\nbecomes important on account of one which follows it; perhaps in a\r\ncertain connection with others, which may seem equally absurd, it is\r\ncapable of forming a very useful construction. The intelligence cannot\r\njudge all these things if it does not hold them steadily long enough to\r\nsee them in connection with the others. In the case of a creative mind,\r\nhowever, the intelligence has withdrawn its watchers from the gates, the\r\nideas rush in pell-mell, and it is only then that the great heap is\r\nlooked over and critically examined. Messrs. Critics, or whatever else\r\nyou may call yourselves, you are ashamed or afraid of the momentary and\r\ntransitory madness which is found in all creators, and whose longer or\r\nshorter duration distinguishes the thinking artist from the dreamer.\r\nHence your complaints about barrenness, for you reject too soon and\r\ndiscriminate too severely\xe2\x80\x9d (Letter of December 1, 1788).\r\n\r\nAnd yet, \xe2\x80\x9csuch a withdrawal of the watchers from the gates of\r\nintelligence,\xe2\x80\x9d as Schiller calls it, such a shifting into the condition\r\nof uncritical self-observation, is in no way difficult.\r\n\r\nMost of my patients accomplish it after the first instructions; I myself\r\ncan do it very perfectly, if I assist the operation by writing down my\r\nnotions. The amount, in terms of psychic energy, by which the critical\r\nactivity is in this manner reduced, and by which the intensity of the\r\nself-observation may be increased, varies widely according to the\r\nsubject matter upon which the attention is to be fixed.\r\n\r\nThe first step in the application of this procedure now teaches us that\r\nnot the dream as a whole, but only the parts of its contents separately,\r\nmay be made the object of our attention. If I ask a patient who is as\r\nyet unpractised: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat occurs to you in connection with this dream?\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\na rule he is unable to fix upon anything in his psychic field of vision.\r\nI must present the dream to him piece by piece, then for every fragment\r\nhe gives me a series of notions, which may be designated as the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbackground thoughts\xe2\x80\x9d of this part of the dream. In this first and\r\nimportant condition, then, the method of dream interpretation which I\r\nemploy avoids the popular, traditional method of interpretation by\r\nsymbolism famous in the legends, and approaches the second, the \xe2\x80\x9ccipher\r\nmethod.\xe2\x80\x9d Like this one it is an interpretation in detail, not _en\r\nmasse_; like this it treats the dream from the beginning as something\r\nput together\xe2\x80\x94as a conglomeration of psychic images.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my psychoanalysis of neurotics, I have indeed already\r\nsubjected many thousand dreams to interpretation, but I do not now wish\r\nto use this material in the introduction to the technique and theory of\r\ndream interpretation. Quite apart from the consideration that I should\r\nexpose myself to the objection that these are dreams of neuropathic\r\nsubjects, the conclusions drawn from which would not admit of\r\nreapplication to the dreams of healthy persons, another reason forces me\r\nto reject them. The theme which is naturally always the subject of these\r\ndreams, is the history of the disease which is responsible for the\r\nneurosis. For this purpose there would be required a very long\r\nintroduction and an investigation into the nature and logical conditions\r\nof psychoneuroses, things which are in themselves novel and unfamiliar\r\nin the highest degree, and which would thus distract attention from the\r\ndream problem. My purpose lies much more in the direction of preparing\r\nthe ground for a solution of difficult problems in the psychology of the\r\nneuroses by means of the solution of dreams. But if I eliminate the\r\ndreams of neurotics, I must not treat the remainder too\r\ndiscriminatingly. Only those dreams still remain which have been\r\noccasionally related to me by healthy persons of my acquaintance, or\r\nwhich I find as examples in the literature of dream life. Unfortunately\r\nin all these dreams the analysis is lacking, without which I cannot find\r\nthe meaning of the dream. My procedure is, of course, not as easy as\r\nthat of the popular cipher method, which translates the given dream\r\ncontent according to an established key; I am much more prepared to find\r\nthat the same dream may cover a different meaning in the case of\r\ndifferent persons, and in a different connection I must then resort to\r\nmy own dreams, as an abundant and convenient material, furnished by a\r\nperson who is about normal, and having reference to many incidents of\r\neveryday life. I shall certainly be with doubts as to the\r\ntrustworthiness of these \xe2\x80\x9cself-analyses.\xe2\x80\x9d Arbitrariness is here in no\r\nway avoided. In my opinion, conditions are more likely to be favourable\r\nin self-observation than in the observation of others; in any case, it\r\nis permissible to see how much can be accomplished by means of\r\nself-analysis. I must overcome further difficulties arising from inner\r\nself. One has a readily understood aversion to exposing so many intimate\r\nthings from one\xe2\x80\x99s own psychic life, and one does not feel safe from the\r\nmisinterpretation of strangers. But one must be able to put one\xe2\x80\x99s self\r\nbeyond this. \xe2\x80\x9cToute psychologiste,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Delb\xc5\x93uf,[26] \xe2\x80\x9cest oblig\xc3\xa9 de\r\nfaire l\xe2\x80\x99aveu m\xc3\xaame de ses faiblesses s\xe2\x80\x99il croit par l\xc3\xa0 jeter du jour sur\r\nquelque probl\xc3\xa8me obscure.\xe2\x80\x9d And I may assume that in the case of the\r\nreader, the immediate interest in the indiscretions which I must commit\r\nwill very soon give way to exclusive engrossment in the psychological\r\nproblems which are illuminated by them.\r\n\r\nI shall, therefore, select one of my own dreams and use it to elucidate\r\nmy method of interpretation. Every such dream necessitates a preliminary\r\nstatement. I must now beg the reader to make my interests his own for a\r\nconsiderable time, and to become absorbed with me in the most trifling\r\ndetails of my life, for an interest in the hidden significance of dreams\r\nimperatively demands such transference.\r\n\r\nPreliminary statement: In the summer of 1895 I had psychoanalytically\r\ntreated a young lady who stood in close friendship to me and those near\r\nto me. It is to be understood that such a complication of relations may\r\nbe the source of manifold feelings for the physician, especially for the\r\npsychotherapist. The personal interest of the physician is greater, his\r\nauthority is less. A failure threatens to undermine the friendship with\r\nthe relatives of the patient. The cure ended with partial success, the\r\npatient got rid of her hysterical fear, but not of all her somatic\r\nsymptoms. I was at that time not yet sure of the criteria marking the\r\nfinal settlement of a hysterical case, and expected her to accept a\r\nsolution which did not seem acceptable to her. In this disagreement, we\r\ncut short the treatment on account of the summer season. One day a\r\nyounger colleague, one of my best friends, who had visited the\r\npatient\xe2\x80\x94Irma\xe2\x80\x94and her family in their country resort, came to see me. I\r\nasked him how he found her, and received the answer: \xe2\x80\x9cShe is better, but\r\nnot altogether well.\xe2\x80\x9d I realise that those words of my friend Otto, or\r\nthe tone of voice in which they were spoken, made me angry. I thought I\r\nheard a reproach in the words, perhaps to the effect that I had promised\r\nthe patient too much, and rightly or wrongly I traced Otto\xe2\x80\x99s supposed\r\nsiding against me to the influence of the relatives of the patient, who,\r\nI assume, had never approved of my treatment. Moreover, my disagreeable\r\nimpression did not become clear to me, nor did I give it expression. The\r\nvery same evening, I wrote down the history of Irma\xe2\x80\x99s case, in order to\r\nhand it, as though for my justification, to Dr. M., a mutual friend, who\r\nwas at that time a leading figure in our circle. During the night\r\nfollowing this evening (perhaps rather in the morning) I had the\r\nfollowing dream, which was registered immediately after waking:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n                       DREAM OF JULY 23\xe2\x80\x9324, 1895\r\n\r\n_A great hall\xe2\x80\x94many guests whom we are receiving\xe2\x80\x94among them Irma, whom I\r\nimmediately take aside, as though to answer her letter, to reproach her\r\nfor not yet accepting the \xe2\x80\x9csolution.\xe2\x80\x9d I say to her: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you still have\r\npains, it is really only your own fault.\xe2\x80\x9d She answers: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you only knew\r\nwhat pains I now have in the neck, stomach, and abdomen; I am drawn\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d I am frightened and look at her. She looks pale and bloated;\r\nI think that after all I must be overlooking some organic affection. I\r\ntake her to the window and look into her throat. She shows some\r\nresistance to this, like a woman who has a false set of teeth. I think\r\nanyway she does not need them. The mouth then really opens without\r\ndifficulty and I find a large white spot to the right, and at another\r\nplace I see extended grayish-white scabs attached to curious curling\r\nformations, which have obviously been formed like the turbinated bone\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nquickly call Dr. M., who repeats the examination and confirms it.... Dr.\r\nM.\xe2\x80\x99s looks are altogether unusual; he is very pale, limps, and has no\r\nbeard on his chin.... My friend Otto is now also standing next to her,\r\nand my friend Leopold percusses her small body and says: \xe2\x80\x9cShe has some\r\ndulness on the left below,\xe2\x80\x9d and also calls attention to an infiltrated\r\nportion of the skin on the left shoulder (something which I feel as he\r\ndoes, in spite of the dress).... M. says: \xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt it is an infection,\r\nbut it does not matter; dysentery will develop too, and the poison will\r\nbe excreted.... We also have immediate knowledge of the origin of the\r\ninfection. My friend Otto has recently given her an injection with a\r\npropyl preparation when she felt ill, propyls.... Propionic acid ...\r\nTrimethylamine (the formula of which I see printed before me in heavy\r\ntype).... Such injections are not made so rashly.... Probably also the\r\nsyringe was not clean.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nThis dream has an advantage over many others. It is at once clear with\r\nwhat events of the preceding day it is connected, and what subject it\r\ntreats. The preliminary statement gives information on these points. The\r\nnews about Irma\xe2\x80\x99s health which I have received from Otto, the history of\r\nthe illness upon which I have written until late at night, have occupied\r\nmy psychic activity even during sleep. In spite of all this, no one, who\r\nhas read the preliminary report and has knowledge of the content of the\r\ndream, has been able to guess what the dream signifies. Nor do I myself\r\nknow. I wonder about the morbid symptoms, of which Irma complains in the\r\ndream, for they are not the same ones for which I have treated her. I\r\nsmile about the consultation with Dr. M. I smile at the nonsensical idea\r\nof an injection with propionic acid, and at the consolation attempted by\r\nDr. M. Towards the end the dream seems more obscure and more terse than\r\nat the beginning. In order to learn the significance of all this, I am\r\ncompelled to undertake a thorough analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n_The hall\xe2\x80\x94many guests, whom we are receiving._\r\n\r\nWe were living this summer at the Bellevue, in an isolated house on one\r\nof the hills which lie close to the Kahlenberg. This house was once\r\nintended as a place of amusement, and on this account has unusually\r\nhigh, hall-like rooms. The dream also occurred at the Bellevue, a few\r\ndays before the birthday of my wife. During the day, my wife had\r\nexpressed the expectation that several friends, among them Irma, would\r\ncome to us as guests for her birthday. My dream, then, anticipates this\r\nsituation: It is the birthday of my wife, and many people, among them\r\nIrma, are received by us as guests in the great hall of the Bellevue.\r\n\r\n_I reproach Irma for not having accepted the solution. I say: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\nstill have pains, it is your own fault.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nI might have said this also, or did say it, while awake. At that time I\r\nhad the opinion (recognised later to be incorrect) that my task was\r\nlimited to informing patients of the hidden meaning of their symptoms.\r\nWhether they then accepted or did not accept the solution upon which\r\nsuccess depended\xe2\x80\x94for that I was not responsible. I am thankful to this\r\nerror, which fortunately has now been overcome, for making life easier\r\nfor me at a time when, with all my unavoidable ignorance, I was to\r\nproduce successful cures. But I see in the speech which I make to Irma\r\nin the dream, that above all things I do not want to be to blame for the\r\npains which she still feels. If it is Irma\xe2\x80\x99s own fault, it cannot be\r\nmine. Should the purpose of the dream be looked for in this quarter?\r\n\r\n_Irma\xe2\x80\x99s complaints; pains in the neck, abdomen, and stomach; she is\r\ndrawn together._\r\n\r\nPains in the stomach belonged to the symptom-complex of my patient, but\r\nthey were not very prominent; she complained rather of sensations of\r\nnausea and disgust. Pains in the neck and abdomen and constriction of\r\nthe throat hardly played a part in her case. I wonder why I decided upon\r\nthis choice of symptoms, nor can I for the moment find the reason.\r\n\r\n_She looks pale and bloated._\r\n\r\nMy patient was always ruddy. I suspect that another person is here being\r\nsubstituted for her.\r\n\r\n_I am frightened at the thought that I must have overlooked some organic\r\naffection._\r\n\r\nThis, as the reader will readily believe, is a constant fear with the\r\nspecialist, who sees neurotics almost exclusively, and who is accustomed\r\nto ascribe so many manifestations, which other physicians treat as\r\norganic, to hysteria. On the other hand, I am haunted by a faint doubt\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nknow not whence it comes\xe2\x80\x94as to whether my fear is altogether honest. If\r\nIrma\xe2\x80\x99s pains are indeed of organic origin, I am not bound to cure them.\r\nMy treatment, of course, removes only hysterical pains. It seems to me,\r\nin fact, that I wish to find an error in the diagnosis; in that case the\r\nreproach of being unsuccessful would be removed.\r\n\r\n_I take her to the window in order to look into her throat. She resists\r\na little, like a woman who has false teeth. I think she does not need\r\nthem anyway._\r\n\r\nI had never had occasion to inspect Irma\xe2\x80\x99s aural cavity. The incident in\r\nthe dream reminds me of an examination, made some time before, of a\r\ngoverness who at first gave an impression of youthful beauty, but who\r\nupon opening her mouth took certain measures for concealing her teeth.\r\nOther memories of medical examinations and of little secrets which are\r\ndiscovered by them, unpleasantly for both examiner and examined, connect\r\nthemselves with this case. \xe2\x80\x9cShe does not need them anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d is at first\r\nperhaps a compliment for Irma; but I suspect a different meaning. In\r\ncareful analysis one feels whether or not the \xe2\x80\x9cbackground thoughts\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich are to be expected have been exhausted. The way in which Irma\r\nstands at the window suddenly reminds me of another experience. Irma\r\npossesses an intimate woman friend, of whom I think very highly. One\r\nevening on paying her a visit I found her in the position at the window\r\nreproduced in the dream, and her physician, the same Dr. M., declared\r\nthat she had a diphtheritic membrane. The person of Dr. M. and the\r\nmembrane return in the course of the dream. Now it occurs to me that\r\nduring the last few months, I have been given every reason to suppose\r\nthat this lady is also hysterical. Yes, Irma herself has betrayed this\r\nto me. But what do I know about her condition? Only the one thing, that\r\nlike Irma she suffers from hysterical choking in dreams. Thus in the\r\ndream I have replaced my patient by her friend. Now I remember that I\r\nhave often trifled with the expectation that this lady might likewise\r\nengage me to relieve her of her symptoms. But even at the time I thought\r\nit improbable, for she is of a very shy nature. _She resists_, as the\r\ndream shows. Another explanation might be that _she does not need it_;\r\nin fact, until now she has shown herself strong enough to master her\r\ncondition without outside help. Now only a few features remain, which I\r\ncan assign neither to Irma nor to her friend: _Pale, bloated, false\r\nteeth_. The false teeth lead me to the governess; I now feel inclined to\r\nbe satisfied with bad teeth. Then another person, to whom these features\r\nmay allude, occurs to me. She is not my patient, and I do not wish her\r\nto be my patient, for I have noticed that she is not at her ease with\r\nme, and I do not consider her a docile patient. She is generally pale,\r\nand once, when she had a particularly good spell, she was bloated.[U] I\r\nhave thus compared my patient Irma with two others, who would likewise\r\nresist treatment. What can it mean that I have exchanged her for her\r\nfriend in the dream? Perhaps that I wish to exchange her; either the\r\nother one arouses in me stronger sympathies or I have a higher opinion\r\nof her intelligence. For I consider Irma foolish because she does not\r\naccept my solution. The other one would be more sensible, and would thus\r\nbe more likely to yield. _The mouth then really opens without\r\ndifficulty_; she would tell more than Irma.[V]\r\n\r\n_What I see in the throat; a white spot and scabby nostrils._\r\n\r\nThe white spot recalls diphtheria, and thus Irma\xe2\x80\x99s friend, but besides\r\nthis it recalls the grave illness of my eldest daughter two years before\r\nand all the anxiety of that unfortunate time. The scab on the nostrils\r\nreminds me of a concern about my own health. At that time I often used\r\ncocaine in order to suppress annoying swellings in the nose, and had\r\nheard a few days before that a lady patient who did likewise had\r\ncontracted an extensive necrosis of the nasal mucous membrane. The\r\nrecommendation of cocaine, which I had made in 1885, had also brought\r\ngrave reproaches upon me. A dear friend, already dead in 1895, had\r\nhastened his end through the misuse of this remedy.\r\n\r\n_I quickly call Dr. M., who repeats the examination._\r\n\r\nThis would simply correspond to the position which M. occupied among us.\r\nBut the word \xe2\x80\x9cquickly\xe2\x80\x9d is striking enough to demand a special\r\nexplanation. It reminds me of a sad medical experience. By the continued\r\nprescription of a remedy (sulfonal) which was still at that time\r\nconsidered harmless, I had once caused the severe intoxication of a\r\nwoman patient, and I had turned in great haste to an older, more\r\nexperienced colleague for assistance. The fact that I really had this\r\ncase in mind is confirmed by an accessory circumstance. The patient, who\r\nsuccumbed to the intoxication, bore the same name as my eldest daughter.\r\nI had never thought of this until now; now it seems to me almost like a\r\nretribution of fate\xe2\x80\x94as though I ought to continue the replacement of the\r\npersons here in another sense; this Matilda for that Matilda; an eye for\r\nan eye, a tooth for a tooth. It is as though I were seeking every\r\nopportunity to reproach myself with lack of medical conscientiousness.\r\n\r\n_Dr. M. is pale, without a beard on his chin, and he limps._\r\n\r\nOf this so much is correct, that his unhealthy appearance often awakens\r\nthe concern of his friends. The other two characteristics must belong to\r\nanother person. A brother living abroad occurs to me, who wears his chin\r\nclean-shaven, and to whom, if I remember aright, M. of the dream on the\r\nwhole bears some resemblance. About him the news arrived some days\r\nbefore that he was lame on account of an arthritic disease in the hip.\r\nThere must be a reason why I fuse the two persons into one in the dream.\r\nI remember that in fact I was on bad terms with both of them for similar\r\nreasons. Both of them had rejected a certain proposal which I had\r\nrecently made to them.\r\n\r\n_My friend Otto is now standing next to the sick woman, and my friend\r\nLeopold examines her and calls attention to a dulness on the left\r\nbelow._\r\n\r\nMy friend Leopold is also a physician, a relative of Otto. Since the two\r\npractise the same specialty, fate has made them competitors, who are\r\ncontinually being compared with each other. Both of them assisted me for\r\nyears, while I was still directing a public dispensary for nervous\r\nchildren. Scenes like the one reproduced in the dream have often taken\r\nplace there. While I was debating with Otto about the diagnosis of a\r\ncase, Leopold had examined the child anew and had made an unexpected\r\ncontribution towards the decision. For there was a difference of\r\ncharacter between the two similar to that between Inspector Brassig and\r\nhis friend Charles. The one was distinguished for his brightness, the\r\nother was slow, thoughtful, but thorough. If I contrast Otto and the\r\ncareful Leopold in the dream, I do it, apparently, in order to extol\r\nLeopold. It is a comparison similar to the one above between the\r\ndisobedient patient Irma and her friend who is thought to be more\r\nsensible. I now become aware of one of the tracks along which the\r\nthought association of the dream progresses; from the sick child to the\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s asylum. The dulness to the left, below, recalls a certain\r\ncase corresponding to it, in every detail in which Leopold astonished me\r\nby his thoroughness. Besides this, I have a notion of something like a\r\nmetastatic affection, but it might rather be a reference to the lady\r\npatient whom I should like to have instead of Irma. For this lady, as\r\nfar as I can gather, resembles a woman suffering from tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n_An infiltrated portion of skin on the left shoulder._\r\n\r\nI see at once that this is my own rheumatism of the shoulder, which I\r\nalways feel when I have remained awake until late at night. The turn of\r\nphrase in the dream also sounds ambiguous; something which I feel ... in\r\nspite of the dress. \xe2\x80\x9cFeel on my own body\xe2\x80\x9d is intended. Moreover, I am\r\nstruck with the unusual sound of the term \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltrated portion of skin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn infiltration behind on the upper left\xe2\x80\x9d is what we are accustomed to;\r\nthis would refer to the lung, and thus again to tuberculosis patients.\r\n\r\n_In spite of the dress._\r\n\r\nThis, to be sure, is only an interpolation. We, of course, examine the\r\nchildren in the clinic undressed; it is some sort of contradiction to\r\nthe manner in which grown-up female patients must be examined. The story\r\nused to be told of a prominent clinician that he always examined his\r\npatients physically only through the clothes. The rest is obscure to me;\r\nI have, frankly, no inclination to follow the matter further.\r\n\r\n_Dr. M. says: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an infection, but it does not matter. Dysentery\r\nwill develop, and the poison will he excreted._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis at first seems ridiculous to me; still it must be carefully\r\nanalysed like everything else. Observed more closely, it seems, however,\r\nto have a kind of meaning. What I had found in the patient was local\r\ndiphtheritis. I remember the discussion about diphtheritis and\r\ndiphtheria at the time of my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s illness. The latter is the\r\ngeneral infection which proceeds from local diphtheritis. Leopold proves\r\nthe existence of such general infection by means of the dulness, which\r\nthus suggests a metastatic lesion. I believe, however, that just this\r\nkind of metastasis does not occur in the case of diphtheria. It rather\r\nrecalls py\xc3\xa6mia.\r\n\r\n_It does not matter_, is a consolation. I believe it fits in as follows:\r\nThe last part of the dream has yielded a content to the effect that the\r\npains of the patient are the result of a serious organic affection. I\r\nbegin to suspect that with this I am only trying to shift the blame from\r\nmyself. Psychic treatment cannot be held responsible for the continued\r\npresence of diphtheritic affection. But now, in turn, I am disturbed at\r\ninventing such serious suffering for Irma for the sole purpose of\r\nexculpating myself. It seems cruel. I need (accordingly) the assurance\r\nthat the result will be happy, and it does not seem ill-advised that I\r\nshould put the words of consolation into the mouth of Dr. M. But here I\r\nconsider myself superior to the dream, a fact which needs explanation.\r\n\r\nBut why is this consolation so nonsensical?\r\n\r\n_Dysentery_:\r\n\r\nSome sort of far-fetched theoretical notion that pathological material\r\nmay be removed through the intestines. Am I in this way trying to make\r\nfun of Dr. M.\xe2\x80\x99s great store of far-fetched explanations, his habit of\r\nfinding curious pathological relationships? Dysentery suggests something\r\nelse. A few months ago I had in charge a young man suffering from\r\nremarkable pains during evacuation of the bowels, a case which\r\ncolleagues had treated as \xe2\x80\x9can\xc3\xa6mia with malnutrition.\xe2\x80\x9d I realised that it\r\nwas a question of hysteria; I was unwilling to use my psychotherapy on\r\nhim, and sent him off on a sea voyage. Now a few days before I had\r\nreceived a despairing letter from him from Egypt, saying that while\r\nthere he had suffered a new attack, which the physician had declared to\r\nbe dysentery. I suspect, indeed, that the diagnosis was only an error of\r\nmy ignorant colleague, who allows hysteria to make a fool of him; but\r\nstill I cannot avoid reproaching myself for putting the invalid in a\r\nposition where he might contract an organic affection of the bowels in\r\naddition to his hysteria. Furthermore, dysentery sounds like diphtheria,\r\na word which does not occur in the dream.\r\n\r\nIndeed it must be that, with the consoling prognosis: \xe2\x80\x9cDysentery will\r\ndevelop, &c.,\xe2\x80\x9d I am making fun of Dr. M., for I recollect that years ago\r\nhe once jokingly told a very similar story of another colleague. He had\r\nbeen called to consult with this colleague in the case of a woman who\r\nwas very seriously ill and had felt obliged to confront the other\r\nphysician, who seemed very hopeful, with the fact that he found albumen\r\nin the patient\xe2\x80\x99s urine. The colleague, however, did not let this worry\r\nhim, but answered calmly: \xe2\x80\x9cThat does not matter, doctor; the albumen\r\nwill without doubt be excreted.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus I can no longer doubt that\r\nderision for those colleagues who are ignorant of hysteria is contained\r\nin this part of the dream. As though in confirmation, this question now\r\narises in my mind: \xe2\x80\x9cDoes Dr. M. know that the symptoms of his patient,\r\nof our friend Irma, which give cause for fearing tuberculosis, are also\r\nbased on hysteria? Has he recognised this hysteria, or has he stupidly\r\nignored it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut what can be my motive in treating this friend so badly? This is very\r\nsimple: Dr. M. agrees with my solution as little as Irma herself. I have\r\nthus already in this dream taken revenge on two persons, on Irma in the\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you still have pains, it is your own fault,\xe2\x80\x9d and on Dr. M. in\r\nthe wording of the nonsensical consolation which has been put into his\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n_We have immediate knowledge of the origin of the infection._\r\n\r\nThis immediate knowledge in the dream is very remarkable. Just before we\r\ndid not know it, since the infection was first demonstrated by Leopold.\r\n\r\n_My friend Otto has recently given her an injection when she felt ill._\r\n\r\nOtto had actually related that in the short time of his visit to Irma\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfamily, he had been called to a neighbouring hotel in order to give an\r\ninjection to some one who fell suddenly ill. Injections again recall the\r\nunfortunate friend who has poisoned himself with cocaine. I had\r\nrecommended the remedy to him merely for internal use during the\r\nwithdrawal of morphine, but he once gave himself injections of cocaine.\r\n\r\n_With a propyl preparation ... propyls ... propionic acid._ How did this\r\never occur to me? On the same evening on which I had written part of the\r\nhistory of the disease before having the dream, my wife opened a bottle\r\nof cordial labelled \xe2\x80\x9cAnanas,\xe2\x80\x9d[W] (which was a present from our friend\r\nOtto. For he had a habit of making presents on every possible occasion;\r\nI hope he will some day be cured of this by a wife).[X] Such a smell of\r\nfusel oil arose from this cordial that I refused to taste it. My wife\r\nobserved: \xe2\x80\x9cWe will give this bottle to the servants,\xe2\x80\x9d and I, still more\r\nprudent, forbade it, with the philanthropic remark: \xe2\x80\x9cThey mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\npoisoned either.\xe2\x80\x9d The smell of fusel oil (amyl ...) has now apparently\r\nawakened in my memory the whole series, propyl, methyl, &c., which has\r\nfurnished the propyl preparation of the dream. In this, it is true, I\r\nhave employed a substitution; I have dreamt of propyl, after smelling\r\namyl, but substitutions of this kind are perhaps permissible, especially\r\nin organic chemistry.\r\n\r\n_Trimethylamin._ I see the chemical formula of this substance in the\r\ndream, a fact which probably gives evidence of a great effort on the\r\npart of my memory, and, moreover, the formula is printed in heavy type,\r\nas if to lay special stress upon something of particular importance, as\r\ndistinguished from the context. To what does this trimethylamin lead,\r\nwhich has been so forcibly called to my attention? It leads to a\r\nconversation with another friend who for years has known all my\r\ngerminating activities, as I have his. At that time he had just informed\r\nme of some of his ideas about sexual chemistry, and had mentioned, among\r\nothers, that he thought he recognised in trimethylamin one of the\r\nproducts of sexual metabolism. This substance thus leads me to\r\nsexuality, to that factor which I credit with the greatest significance\r\nfor the origin of the nervous affections which I attempt to cure. My\r\npatient Irma is a young widow; if I am anxious to excuse the failure of\r\nher cure, I suppose I shall best do so by referring to this condition,\r\nwhich her admirers would be glad to change. How remarkably, too, such a\r\ndream is fashioned! The other woman, whom I take as my patient in the\r\ndream instead of Irma, is also a young widow.\r\n\r\nI suspect why the formula of trimethylamin has made itself so prominent\r\nin the dream. So many important things are gathered up in this one word:\r\nTrimethylamin is not only an allusion to the overpowering factor of\r\nsexuality, but also to a person whose sympathy I remember with\r\nsatisfaction when I feel myself forsaken in my opinions. Should not this\r\nfriend, who plays such a large part in my life, occur again in the chain\r\nof thoughts of the dream? Of course, he must; he is particularly\r\nacquainted with the results which proceed from affections of the nose\r\nand its adjacent cavities, and has revealed to science several highly\r\nremarkable relations of the turbinated bones to the female sexual organs\r\n(the three curly formations in Irma\xe2\x80\x99s throat). I have had Irma examined\r\nby him to see whether the pains in her stomach might be of nasal origin.\r\nBut he himself suffers from suppurative rhinitis, which worries him, and\r\nto this perhaps there is an allusion in py\xc3\xa6mia, which hovers before me\r\nin the metastases of the dream.\r\n\r\n_Such injections are not made so rashly._ Here the reproach of\r\ncarelessness is hurled directly at my friend Otto. I am under the\r\nimpression that I had some thought of this sort in the afternoon, when\r\nhe seemed to indicate his siding against me by word and look. It was\r\nperhaps: \xe2\x80\x9cHow easily he can be influenced; how carelessly he pronounces\r\njudgment.\xe2\x80\x9d Furthermore, the above sentence again points to my deceased\r\nfriend, who so lightly took refuge in cocaine injections. As I have\r\nsaid, I had not intended injections of the remedy at all. I see that in\r\nreproaching Otto I again touch upon the story of the unfortunate\r\nMatilda, from which arises the same reproach against me. Obviously I am\r\nhere collecting examples of my own conscientiousness, but also of the\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\n_Probably also the syringe was not clean._ Another reproach directed at\r\nOtto, but originating elsewhere. The day before I happened to meet the\r\nson of a lady eighty-two years of age whom I am obliged to give daily\r\ntwo injections of morphine. At present she is in the country, and I have\r\nheard that she is suffering from an inflammation of the veins. I\r\nimmediately thought that it was a case of infection due to contamination\r\nfrom the syringe. It is my pride that in two years I have not given her\r\na single infection; I am constantly concerned, of course, to see that\r\nthe syringe is perfectly clean. For I am conscientious. From the\r\ninflammation of the veins, I return to my wife, who had suffered from\r\nemboli during a period of pregnancy, and now three related situations\r\ncome to the surface in my memory, involving my wife, Irma, and the\r\ndeceased Matilda, the identity of which three persons plainly justifies\r\nmy putting them in one another\xe2\x80\x99s place.\r\n\r\nI have now completed the interpretation of the dream.[Y] In the course\r\nof this interpretation I have taken great pains to get possession of all\r\nthe notions to which a comparison between the dream content and the\r\ndream thoughts hidden behind it must have given rise. Meanwhile, the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmeaning\xe2\x80\x9d of the dream has dawned upon me. I have become conscious of a\r\npurpose which is realised by means of the dream, and which must have\r\nbeen the motive for dreaming. The dream fulfils several wishes, which\r\nhave been actuated in me by the events of the preceding evening (Otto\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnews, and the writing down of the history of the disease). For the\r\nresult of the dream is that I am not to blame for the suffering which\r\nIrma still has, and that Otto is to blame for it. Now Otto has made me\r\nangry by his remark about Irma\xe2\x80\x99s imperfect cure; the dream avenges me\r\nupon him by turning the reproach back upon himself. The dream acquits me\r\nof responsibility for Irma\xe2\x80\x99s condition by referring it to other causes,\r\nwhich indeed furnish a great number of explanations. The dream\r\nrepresents a certain condition of affairs as I should wish it to be;\r\n_the content of the dream is thus the fulfilment of a wish; its motive\r\nis a wish_.\r\n\r\nThis much is apparent at first sight. But many things in the details of\r\nthe dream become intelligible when regarded from the point of view of\r\nwish-fulfilment. I take revenge on Otto, not only for hastily taking\r\npart against me, in that I accuse him of a careless medical operation\r\n(the injection), but I am also avenged on him for the bad cordial which\r\nsmells like fusel oil, and I find an expression in the dream which\r\nunites both reproaches; the injection with a preparation of propyl.\r\nStill I am not satisfied, but continue my revenge by comparing him to\r\nhis more reliable competitor. I seem to say by this: \xe2\x80\x9cI like him better\r\nthan you.\xe2\x80\x9d But Otto is not the only one who must feel the force of my\r\nanger. I take revenge on the disobedient patient by exchanging her for a\r\nmore sensible, more docile one. Nor do I leave the contradiction of Dr.\r\nM. unnoticed, but express my opinion of him in an obvious allusion, to\r\nthe effect that his relation to the question is that of _an ignoramus_\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9c_dysentery will develop_,\xe2\x80\x9d _&c._).\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, indeed, as though I were appealing from him to some one\r\nbetter informed (my friend, who has told me about trimethylamin); just\r\nas I have turned from Irma to her friend, I turn from Otto to Leopold.\r\nRid me of these three persons, replace them by three others of my own\r\nchoice, and I shall be released from the reproaches which I do not wish\r\nto have deserved! The unreasonableness itself of these reproaches is\r\nproved to me in the dream in the most elaborate way. Irma\xe2\x80\x99s pains are\r\nnot charged to me, because she herself is to blame for them, in that she\r\nrefuses to accept my solution. Irma\xe2\x80\x99s pains are none of my business, for\r\nthey are of an organic nature, quite impossible to be healed by a\r\npsychic cure. Irma\xe2\x80\x99s sufferings are satisfactorily explained by her\r\nwidowhood (trimethylamin!); a fact which, of course, I cannot alter.\r\nIrma\xe2\x80\x99s illness has been caused by an incautious injection on the part of\r\nOtto, with an ill-suited substance\xe2\x80\x94in a way I should never have made an\r\ninjection. Irma\xe2\x80\x99s suffering is the result of an injection made with an\r\nunclean syringe, just like the inflammation of the veins in my old lady,\r\nwhile I never do any such mischief with my injections. I am aware,\r\nindeed, that these explanations of Irma\xe2\x80\x99s illness, which unite in\r\nacquitting me, do not agree with one another; they even exclude one\r\nanother. The whole pleading\xe2\x80\x94this dream is nothing else\xe2\x80\x94recalls vividly\r\nthe defensive argument of a man who was accused by his neighbour of\r\nhaving returned a kettle to him in a damaged condition. In the first\r\nplace, he said, he had returned the kettle undamaged; in the second, it\r\nalready had holes in it when he borrowed it; and thirdly, he had never\r\nborrowed the kettle from his neighbour at all. But so much the better;\r\nif even one of these three methods of defence is recognised as valid,\r\nthe man must be acquitted.\r\n\r\nStill other subjects mingle in the dream, whose relation to my release\r\nfrom responsibility for Irma\xe2\x80\x99s illness is not so transparent: the\r\nillness of my daughter and that of a patient of the same name, the\r\nharmfulness of cocaine, the illness of my patient travelling in Egypt,\r\nconcern about the health of my wife, my brother, of Dr. M., my own\r\nbodily troubles, and concern about the absent friend who is suffering\r\nfrom suppurative rhinitis. But if I keep all these things in view, they\r\ncombine into a single train of thought, labelled perhaps: Concern for\r\nthe health of myself and others\xe2\x80\x94professional conscientiousness. I recall\r\nan undefined disagreeable sensation as Otto brought me the news of\r\nIrma\xe2\x80\x99s condition. I should like to note finally the expression of this\r\nfleeting sensation, which is part of the train of thought that is\r\nmingled into the dream. It is as though Otto had said to me: \xe2\x80\x9cYou do not\r\ntake your physician\xe2\x80\x99s duties seriously enough, you are not\r\nconscientious, do not keep your promises.\xe2\x80\x9d Thereupon this train of\r\nthought placed itself at my service in order that I might exhibit proof\r\nof the high degree in which I am conscientious, how intimately I am\r\nconcerned with the health of my relatives, friends, and patients.\r\nCuriously enough, there are also in this thought material some painful\r\nmemories, which correspond rather to the blame attributed to Otto than\r\nto the accusation against me. The material has the appearance of being\r\nimpartial, but the connection between this broader material, upon which\r\nthe dream depends, and the more limited theme of the dream which gives\r\nrise to the wish to be innocent of Irma\xe2\x80\x99s illness, is nevertheless\r\nunmistakable.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to claim that I have revealed the meaning of the dream\r\nentirely, or that the interpretation is flawless.\r\n\r\nI could still spend much time upon it; I could draw further explanations\r\nfrom it, and bring up new problems which it bids us consider. I even\r\nknow the points from which further thought associations might be traced;\r\nbut such considerations as are connected with every dream of one\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nrestrain me from the work of interpretation. Whoever is ready to condemn\r\nsuch reserve, may himself try to be more straightforward than I. I am\r\ncontent with the discovery which has been just made. If the method of\r\ndream interpretation here indicated is followed, it will be found that\r\nthe dream really has meaning, and is by no means the expression of\r\nfragmentary brain activity, which the authors would have us believe.\r\n_When the work of interpretation has been completed the dream may be\r\nrecognised as the fulfilment of a wish._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n                 THE DREAM IS THE FULFILMENT OF A WISH\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen after passing a defile one has reached an eminence where the ways\r\npart and where the view opens out broadly in different directions, it is\r\npermissible to stop for a moment and to consider where one is to turn\r\nnext. Something like this happens to us after we have mastered this\r\nfirst dream interpretation. We find ourselves in the open light of a\r\nsudden cognition. The dream is not comparable to the irregular sounds of\r\na musical instrument, which, instead of being touched by the hand of the\r\nmusician, is struck by some outside force; the dream is not senseless,\r\nnot absurd, does not presuppose that a part of our store of ideas is\r\ndormant while another part begins to awaken. It is a psychic phenomenon\r\nof full value, and indeed the fulfilment of a wish; it takes its place\r\nin the concatenation of the waking psychic actions which are\r\nintelligible to us, and it has been built up by a highly complicated\r\nintellectual activity. But at the very moment when we are inclined to\r\nrejoice in this discovery, a crowd of questions overwhelms us. If the\r\ndream, according to the interpretation, represents a wish fulfilled,\r\nwhat is the cause of the peculiar and unfamiliar manner in which this\r\nfulfilment is expressed? What changes have occurred in the dream\r\nthoughts before they are transformed into the manifest dream which we\r\nremember upon awaking? In what manner has this transformation taken\r\nplace? Whence comes the material which has been worked over into the\r\ndream? What causes the peculiarities which we observe in the dream\r\nthoughts, for example, that they may contradict one another? (The\r\nanalogy of the kettle, p. 87). Is the dream capable of teaching us\r\nsomething new about our inner psychic processes, and can its content\r\ncorrect opinions which we have held during the day? I suggest that for\r\nthe present all these questions be laid aside, and that a single path be\r\npursued. We have found that the dream represents a wish as fulfilled. It\r\nwill be our next interest to ascertain whether this is a universal\r\ncharacteristic of the dream, or only the accidental content of the dream\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cof Irma\xe2\x80\x99s injection\xe2\x80\x9d) with which we have begun our analysis, for even\r\nif we make up our minds that every dream has a meaning and psychic\r\nvalue, we must nevertheless allow for the possibility that this meaning\r\nis not the same in every dream. The first dream we have considered was\r\nthe fulfilment of a wish; another may turn out to be a realised\r\napprehension; a third may have a reflection as to its content; a fourth\r\nmay simply reproduce a reminiscence. Are there then other wish dreams;\r\nor are there possibly nothing but wish dreams?\r\n\r\nIt is easy to show that the character of wish-fulfilment in dreams is\r\noften undisguised and recognisable, so that one may wonder why the\r\nlanguage of dreams has not long since been understood. There is, for\r\nexample, a dream which I can cause as often as I like, as it were\r\nexperimentally. If in the evening I eat anchovies, olives, or other\r\nstrongly salted foods, I become thirsty at night, whereupon I waken. The\r\nawakening, however, is preceded by a dream, which each time has the same\r\ncontent, namely, that I am drinking. I quaff water in long draughts, it\r\ntastes as sweet as only a cool drink can taste when one\xe2\x80\x99s throat is\r\nparched, and then I awake and have an actual desire to drink. The\r\noccasion for this dream is thirst, which I perceive when I awake. The\r\nwish to drink originates from this sensation, and the dream shows me\r\nthis wish as fulfilled. It thereby serves a function the nature of which\r\nI soon guess. I sleep well, and am not accustomed to be awakened by a\r\nbodily need. If I succeed in assuaging my thirst by means of the dream\r\nthat I am drinking, I need not wake up in order to satisfy it. It is\r\nthus a dream of convenience. The dream substitutes itself for action, as\r\nelsewhere in life. Unfortunately the need of water for quenching thirst\r\ncannot be satisfied with a dream, like my thirst for revenge upon Otto\r\nand Dr. M., but the intention is the same. This same dream recently\r\nappeared in modified form. On this occasion I became thirsty before\r\ngoing to bed, and emptied the glass of water which stood on the little\r\nchest next to my bed. Several hours later in the night came a new attack\r\nof thirst, accompanied by discomfort. In order to obtain water, I should\r\nhave had to get up and fetch the glass which stood on the night-chest of\r\nmy wife. I thus quite appropriately dreamt that my wife was giving me a\r\ndrink from a vase; this vase was an Etruscan cinerary urn which I had\r\nbrought home from an Italian journey and had since given away. But the\r\nwater in it tasted so salty (apparently from the ashes) that I had to\r\nwake. It may be seen how conveniently the dream is capable of arranging\r\nmatters; since the fulfilment of a wish is its only purpose, it may be\r\nperfectly egotistic. Love of comfort is really not compatible with\r\nconsideration for others. The introduction of the cinerary urn is\r\nprobably again the fulfilment of a wish; I am sorry that I no longer\r\npossess this vase; it, like the glass of water at my wife\xe2\x80\x99s side, is\r\ninaccessible to me. The cinerary urn is also appropriate to the\r\nsensation of a salty taste which has now grown stronger, and which I\r\nknow will force me to wake up.[Z]\r\n\r\nSuch convenience dreams were very frequent with me in the years of my\r\nyouth. Accustomed as I had always been to work until late at night,\r\nearly awakening was always a matter of difficulty for me. I used then to\r\ndream that I was out of bed and was standing at the wash-stand. After a\r\nwhile I could not make myself admit that I have not yet got up, but\r\nmeanwhile I had slept for a time. I am acquainted with the same dream of\r\nlaziness as dreamt by a young colleague of mine, who seems to share my\r\npropensity for sleep. The lodging-house keeper with whom he was living\r\nin the neighbourhood of the hospital had strict orders to wake him on\r\ntime every morning, but she certainly had a lot of trouble when she\r\ntried to carry out his orders. One morning sleep was particularly sweet.\r\nThe woman called into the room: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Joe, get up; you must go to the\r\nhospital.\xe2\x80\x9d Whereupon the sleeper dreamt of a room in the hospital, a bed\r\nin which he was lying, and a chart pinned over his head reading: \xe2\x80\x9cJoe\r\nH.... cand. med. 22 years old.\xe2\x80\x9d He said to himself in the dream: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\r\nam already at the hospital, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go there,\xe2\x80\x9d turned over and\r\nslept on. He had thus frankly admitted to himself his motive for\r\ndreaming.\r\n\r\nHere is another dream, the stimulus for which acts during sleep itself:\r\nOne of my women patients, who had had to undergo an unsuccessful\r\noperation on the jaw, was to wear a cooling apparatus on the affected\r\ncheek, according to the orders of the physicians. But she was in the\r\nhabit of throwing it off as soon as she had got to sleep. One day I was\r\nasked to reprove her for doing so; for she had again thrown the\r\napparatus on the floor. The patient defended herself as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cThis\r\ntime I really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it; it was the result of a dream which I had\r\nin the night. In the dream, I was in a box at the opera and was taking a\r\nlively interest in the performance. But Mr. Karl Meyer was lying in the\r\nsanatorium and complaining pitifully on account of pains in his jaw. I\r\nsaid to myself, \xe2\x80\x98Since I haven\xe2\x80\x99t the pains, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need the apparatus\r\neither,\xe2\x80\x99 that\xe2\x80\x99s why I threw it away.\xe2\x80\x9d This dream of the poor sufferer is\r\nsimilar to the idea in the expression which comes to our lips when we\r\nare in a disagreeable situation: \xe2\x80\x9cI know something that\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal\r\nmore fun.\xe2\x80\x9d The dream presents this great deal more fun. Mr. Karl Meyer,\r\nto whom the dreamer attributed her pains, was the most indifferent young\r\nman of her acquaintance whom she could recall.\r\n\r\nIt is no more difficult to discover the fulfilment of wishes in several\r\ndreams which I have collected from healthy persons. A friend who knew my\r\ntheory of dreams and had imparted it to his wife, said to me one day:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife asked me to tell you that she dreamt yesterday that she was\r\nhaving her menses. You will know what that means.\xe2\x80\x9d Of course I know: if\r\nthe young wife dreams that she is having her menses, the menses have\r\nstopped. I can understand that she would have liked to enjoy her freedom\r\nfor a time longer before the discomforts of motherhood began. It was a\r\nclever way of giving notice of her first pregnancy. Another friend\r\nwrites that his wife had recently dreamt that she noticed milk stains on\r\nthe bosom of her waist. This is also an indication of pregnancy, but\r\nthis time not of the first one; the young mother wishes to have more\r\nnourishment for the second child than she had for the first.\r\n\r\nA young woman, who for weeks had been cut off from company because she\r\nwas nursing a child that was suffering from an infectious disease,\r\ndreams, after its safe termination, of a company of people in which A.\r\nDaudet, Bourget, M. Prevost, and others are present, all of whom are\r\nvery pleasant to her and entertain her admirably. The different authors\r\nin the dream also have the features which their pictures give them. M.\r\nPrevost, with whose picture she is not familiar, looks like\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ndisinfecting man who on the previous day had cleaned the sick rooms and\r\nhad entered them as the first visitor after a long period. Apparently\r\nthe dream might be perfectly translated thus: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is about time now for\r\nsomething more entertaining than this eternal nursing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerhaps this selection will suffice to prove that often and under the\r\nmost complex conditions dreams are found which can be understood only as\r\nfulfilments of wishes, and which present their contents without\r\nconcealment. In most cases these are short and simple dreams, which\r\nstand in pleasant contrast to the confused and teeming dream\r\ncompositions which have mainly attracted the attention of the authors.\r\nBut it will pay to spend some time upon these simple dreams. The most\r\nsimple dreams of all, I suppose, are to be expected in the case of\r\nchildren, whose psychic activities are certainly less complicated than\r\nthose of adults. The psychology of children, in my opinion, is to be\r\ncalled upon for services similar to those which a study of the anatomy\r\nand development of the lower animals renders to the investigation of the\r\nstructure of the highest classes of animals. Until now only a few\r\nconscious efforts have been made to take advantage of the psychology of\r\nchildren for such a purpose.\r\n\r\nThe dreams of little children are simple fulfilments of wishes, and as\r\ncompared, therefore, with the dreams of adults, are not at all\r\ninteresting. They present no problem to be solved, but are naturally\r\ninvaluable as affording proof that the dream in its essence signifies\r\nthe fulfilment of a wish. I have been able to collect several examples\r\nof such dreams from the material furnished by my own children.\r\n\r\nFor two dreams, one of my daughters, at that time eight and a half years\r\nold, the other of a boy five and a quarter years of age, I am indebted\r\nto an excursion to the beautiful Hallstatt in the summer of 1896. I must\r\nmake the preliminary statement that during this summer we were living on\r\na hill near Aussee, from which, when the weather was good, we enjoyed a\r\nsplendid view of the Dachstein from the roof of our house. The Simony\r\nHut could easily be recognised with a telescope. The little ones often\r\ntried to see it through the telescope\xe2\x80\x94I do not know with what success.\r\nBefore the excursion I had told the children that Hallstatt lay at the\r\nfoot of the Dachstein. They looked forward to the day with great joy.\r\nFrom Hallstatt we entered the valley of Eschern, which highly pleased\r\nthe children with its varying aspects. One of them, however, the boy of\r\nfive, gradually became discontented. As often as a mountain came in\r\nview, he would ask: \xe2\x80\x9cIs that the Dachstein?\xe2\x80\x9d whereupon I would have to\r\nanswer: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, only a foot-hill.\xe2\x80\x9d After this question had been repeated\r\nseveral times, he became altogether silent; and he was quite unwilling\r\nto come along on the flight of steps to the waterfall. I thought he was\r\ntired out. But the next morning, he approached me radiant with joy, and\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cLast night I dreamt that we were at Simony Hut.\xe2\x80\x9d I understood him\r\nnow; he had expected, as I was speaking of the Dachstein, that on the\r\nexcursion to Hallstatt, he would ascend the mountain and would come face\r\nto face with the hut, about which there had been so much discussion at\r\nthe telescope. When he learned that he was expected to be regaled with\r\nfoot-hills and a waterfall, he was disappointed and became discontented.\r\nThe dream compensated him for this. I tried to learn some details of the\r\ndream; they were scanty. \xe2\x80\x9cSteps must be climbed for six hours,\xe2\x80\x9d as he\r\nhad heard.\r\n\r\nOn this excursion wishes, destined to be satisfied only in dreams, had\r\narisen also in the mind of the girl of eight and a half years. We had\r\ntaken with us to Hallstatt the twelve-year-old boy of our neighbour\xe2\x80\x94an\r\naccomplished cavalier, who, it seems to me, already enjoyed the full\r\nsympathy of the little woman. The next morning, then, she related the\r\nfollowing dream: \xe2\x80\x9cJust think, I dreamt that Emil was one of us, that he\r\nsaid papa and mamma to you, and slept at our house in the big room like\r\nour boys. Then mamma came into the room and threw a large handful of\r\nchocolate bars under our beds.\xe2\x80\x9d The brothers of the girl, who evidently\r\nhad not inherited a familiarity with dream interpretation, declared just\r\nlike the authors: \xe2\x80\x9cThat dream is nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d The girl defended at least a\r\npart of the dream, and it is worth while, from the point of view of the\r\ntheory of neuroses, to know which part: \xe2\x80\x9cThat about Emil belonging to us\r\nis nonsense, but that about the bars of chocolate is not.\xe2\x80\x9d It was just\r\nthis latter part that was obscure to me. For this mamma furnished me the\r\nexplanation. On the way home from the railway station the children had\r\nstopped in front of a slot machine, and had desired exactly such\r\nchocolate bars wrapped in paper with a metallic lustre, as the machine,\r\naccording to their experience, had for sale. But the mother had rightly\r\nthought that the day had brought enough wish-fulfilment, and had left\r\nthis wish to be satisfied in dreams. This little scene had escaped me. I\r\nat once understood that portion of the dream which had been condemned by\r\nmy daughter. I had myself heard the well-behaved guest enjoining the\r\nchildren to wait until papa or mamma had come up. For the little one the\r\ndream made a lasting adoption based on this temporary relation of the\r\nboy to us. Her tender nature was as yet unacquainted with any form of\r\nbeing together except those mentioned in the dream, which are taken from\r\nher brothers. Why the chocolate bars were thrown under the bed could\r\nnot, of course, be explained without questioning the child.\r\n\r\nFrom a friend I have learnt of a dream very similar to that of my boy.\r\nIt concerned an eight-year-old girl. The father had undertaken a walk to\r\nDornbach with the children, intending to visit the Rohrerh\xc3\xbctte, but\r\nturned back because it had grown too late, and promised the children to\r\nmake up for their disappointment some other time. On the way back, they\r\npassed a sign which showed the way to the Hameau. The children now asked\r\nto be taken to that place also, but had to be content, for the same\r\nreason, with a postponement to another day. The next morning, the\r\neight-year-old girl came to the father, satisfied, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cPapa, I\r\ndreamt last night that you were with us at the Rohrerh\xc3\xbctte and on the\r\nHameau.\xe2\x80\x9d Her impatience had thus in the dream anticipated the fulfilment\r\nof the promise made by her father.\r\n\r\nAnother dream, which the picturesque beauty of the Aussee inspired in my\r\ndaughter, at that time three and a quarter years old, is equally\r\nstraightforward. The little one had crossed the lake for the first time,\r\nand the trip had passed too quickly for her. She did not want to leave\r\nthe boat at the landing, and cried bitterly. The next morning she told\r\nus: \xe2\x80\x9cLast night I was sailing on the lake.\xe2\x80\x9d Let us hope that the\r\nduration of this dream ride was more satisfactory to her.\r\n\r\nMy eldest boy, at that time eight years of age, was already dreaming of\r\nthe realisation of his fancies. He had been riding in a chariot with\r\nAchilles, with Diomed as charioteer. He had, of course, on the previous\r\nday shown a lively interest in the _Myths of Greece_, which had been\r\ngiven to his elder sister.\r\n\r\nIf it be granted that the talking of children in sleep likewise belongs\r\nto the category of dreaming, I may report the following as one of the\r\nmost recent dreams in my collection. My youngest girl, at that time\r\nnineteen months old, had vomited one morning, and had therefore been\r\nkept without food throughout the day. During the night which followed\r\nupon this day of hunger, she was heard to call excitedly in her sleep:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnna Feud, strawberry, huckleberry, omelette, pap!\xe2\x80\x9d She used her name\r\nin this way in order to express her idea of property; the menu must have\r\nincluded about everything which would seem to her a desirable meal; the\r\nfact that berries appeared in it twice was a demonstration against the\r\ndomestic sanitary regulations, and was based on the circumstance, by no\r\nmeans overlooked by her, that the nurse ascribed her indisposition to an\r\nover-plentiful consumption of strawberries; she thus in the dream took\r\nrevenge for this opinion which was distasteful to her.[AA]\r\n\r\nIf we call childhood happy because it does not yet know sexual desire,\r\nwe must not forget how abundant a source of disappointment and\r\nself-denial, and thus of dream stimulation, the other of the great\r\nlife-impulses may become for it.[AB] Here is a second example showing\r\nthis. My nephew of twenty-two months had been given the task of\r\ncongratulating me upon my birthday, and of handing me, as a present, a\r\nlittle basket of cherries, which at that time of the year were not yet\r\nin season. It seemed difficult for him, for he repeated again and again:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCherries in it,\xe2\x80\x9d and could not be induced to let the little basket go\r\nout of his hands. But he knew how to secure his compensation. He had,\r\nuntil now, been in the habit of telling his mother every morning that he\r\nhad dreamt of the \xe2\x80\x9cwhite soldier,\xe2\x80\x9d an officer of the guard in a white\r\ncloak, whom he had once admired on the street. On the day after the\r\nbirthday, he awakened joyfully with the information which could have had\r\nits origin only in a dream: \xe2\x80\x9cHe(r)man eat up all the cherries!\xe2\x80\x9d[AC]\r\n\r\nWhat animals dream of I do not know. A proverb for which I am indebted\r\nto one of my readers claims to know, for it raises the question: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\ndoes the goose dream of?\xe2\x80\x9d the answer being: \xe2\x80\x9cOf maize!\xe2\x80\x9d The whole theory\r\nthat the dream is the fulfilment of a wish is contained in these\r\nsentences.[AD]\r\n\r\nWe now perceive that we should have reached our theory of the hidden\r\nmeaning of the dream by the shortest road if we had merely consulted\r\ncolloquial usage. The wisdom of proverbs, it is true, sometimes speaks\r\ncontemptuously enough of the dream\xe2\x80\x94it apparently tries to justify\r\nscience in expressing the opinion that \xe2\x80\x9cDreams are mere bubbles;\xe2\x80\x9d but\r\nstill for colloquial usage the dream is the gracious fulfiller of\r\nwishes. \xe2\x80\x9cI should never have fancied that in the wildest dream,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexclaims one who finds his expectations surpassed in reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n                          DISTORTION IN DREAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I make the assertion that wish fulfilment is the meaning of every\r\ndream, that, accordingly, there can be no dreams except wish dreams, I\r\nam sure at the outset to meet with the most emphatic contradiction.\r\nObjections will be made to this effect: \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that there are dreams\r\nwhich must be understood as fulfilments of wishes is not new, but, on\r\nthe contrary, has long since been recognised by the authors. _Cf._\r\nRadestock[54] (pp. 137\xe2\x80\x93138), Volkelt[72] (pp. 110\xe2\x80\x93111), Tissi\xc3\xa9[68] (p.\r\n70), M. Simon[63] (p. 42) on the hunger dreams of the imprisoned Baron\r\nTrenck, and the passage in Griesinger[31] (p. 11). The assumption that\r\nthere can be nothing but dreams of wish fulfilment, however, is another\r\nof those unjustified generalisations by which you have been pleased to\r\ndistinguish yourself of late. Indeed dreams which exhibit the most\r\npainful content, but not a trace of wish fulfilment, occur plentifully\r\nenough. The pessimistic philosopher, Edward von Hartman, perhaps stands\r\nfurthest from the theory of wish fulfilment. He expresses himself in his\r\n_Philosophy of the Unconscious_, Part II. (stereotyped edition, p. 34),\r\nto the following effect:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98As regards the dream, all the troubles of waking life are transferred\r\nby it to the sleeping state; only the one thing, which can in some\r\nmeasure reconcile a cultured person to life-scientific and artistic\r\nenjoyment is not transferred....\xe2\x80\x99 But even less discontented observers\r\nhave laid emphasis on the fact that in dreams pain and disgust are more\r\nfrequent than pleasure; so Scholz[59] (p. 39), Volkelt[72] (p. 80), and\r\nothers. Indeed two ladies, Sarah Weed and Florence Hallam,[33] have\r\nfound from the elaboration of their dreams a mathematical expression for\r\nthe preponderance of displeasure in dreams. They designate 58 per cent.\r\nof the dreams as disagreeable, and only 28\xc2\xb76 per cent. as positively\r\npleasant. Besides those dreams which continue the painful sensations of\r\nlife during sleep, there are also dreams of fear, in which this most\r\nterrible of all disagreeable sensations tortures us until we awake, and\r\nit is with just these dreams of fear that children are so often\r\npersecuted (_Cf._ Debacker [17] concerning the Pavor Nocturnus), though\r\nit is in the case of children that you have found dreams of wishing\r\nundisguised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIndeed it is the anxiety dreams which seem to prevent a generalisation\r\nof the thesis that the dream is a wish-fulfilment, which we have\r\nestablished by means of the examples in the last section; they seem even\r\nto brand this thesis as an absurdity.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult, however, to escape these apparently conclusive\r\nobjections. Please observe that our doctrine does not rest upon an\r\nacceptance of the manifest dream content, but has reference to the\r\nthought content which is found to lie behind the dream by the process of\r\ninterpretation. Let us contrast the _manifest_ and the _latent dream\r\ncontent_. It is true that there are dreams whose content is of the most\r\npainful nature. But has anyone ever tried to interpret these dreams, to\r\ndisclose their latent thought content? If not, the two objections are no\r\nlonger valid against us; there always remains the possibility that even\r\npainful and fearful dreams may be discovered to be wish fulfilments upon\r\ninterpretation.[AE]\r\n\r\nIn scientific work it is often advantageous, when the solution of one\r\nproblem presents difficulties, to take up a second problem, just as it\r\nis easier to crack two nuts together instead of separately. Accordingly\r\nwe are confronted not merely with the problem: How can painful and\r\nfearful dreams be the fulfilments of wishes? but we may also, from our\r\ndiscussion so far, raise the question: Why do not the dreams which show\r\nan indifferent content, but turn out to be wish-fulfilments, show this\r\nmeaning undisguised? Take the fully reported dream of Irma\xe2\x80\x99s injection;\r\nit is in no way painful in its nature, and can be recognised, upon\r\ninterpretation, as a striking wish-fulfilment. Why, in the first place,\r\nis an interpretation necessary? Why does not the dream say directly what\r\nit means? As a matter of fact, even the dream of Irma\xe2\x80\x99s injection does\r\nnot at first impress us as representing a wish of the dreamer as\r\nfulfilled. The reader will not have received this impression, and even I\r\nmyself did not know it until I had undertaken the analysis. If we call\r\nthis peculiarity of the dream of needing an explanation _the fact of the\r\ndistortion_ of dreams, then a second question arises: What is the origin\r\nof this disfigurement of dreams?\r\n\r\nIf one\xe2\x80\x99s first impressions on this subject were consulted, one might\r\nhappen upon several possible solutions; for example, that there is an\r\ninability during sleep to find an adequate expression for the dream\r\nthoughts. The analysis of certain dreams, however, compels us to give\r\nthe disfigurement of dreams another explanation. I shall show this by\r\nemploying a second dream of my own, which again involves numerous\r\nindiscretions, but which compensates for this personal sacrifice by\r\naffording a thorough elucidation of the problem.\r\n\r\n_Preliminary Statement._\xe2\x80\x94In the spring of 1897 I learnt that two\r\nprofessors of our university had proposed me for appointment as\r\nProfessor extraord. (assistant professor). This news reached me\r\nunexpectedly and pleased me considerably as an expression of\r\nappreciation on the part of two eminent men which could not be explained\r\nby personal interest. But, I immediately thought, I must not permit\r\nmyself to attach any expectation to this event. The university\r\ngovernment had during the last few years left proposals of this kind\r\nunconsidered, and several colleagues, who were ahead of me in years, and\r\nwho were at least my equals in merit, had been waiting in vain during\r\nthis time for their appointment. I had no reason to suppose I should\r\nfare better. I resolved then to comfort myself. I am not, so far as I\r\nknow, ambitious, and I engage in medical practice with satisfying\r\nresults even without the recommendation of a title. Moreover, it was not\r\na question whether I considered the grapes sweet or sour, for they\r\nundoubtedly hung much too high for me.\r\n\r\nOne evening I was visited by a friend of mine, one of those colleagues\r\nwhose fate I had taken as a warning for myself. As he had long been a\r\ncandidate for promotion to the position of professor, which in our\r\nsociety raises the physician to a demigod among his patients, and as he\r\nwas less resigned than I, he was in the habit of making representations\r\nfrom time to time, at the offices of the university government, for the\r\npurpose of advancing his interests. He came to me from a visit of that\r\nkind. He said that this time he had driven the exalted gentleman into a\r\ncorner, and had asked him directly whether considerations of creed were\r\nnot really responsible for the deferment of his appointment. The answer\r\nhad been that to be sure\xe2\x80\x94in the present state of public opinion\xe2\x80\x94His\r\nExcellency was not in a position, &c. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I at least know what I am\r\nat,\xe2\x80\x9d said my friend in closing his narrative, which told me nothing new,\r\nbut which was calculated to confirm me in my resignation. For the same\r\nconsiderations of creed applied to my own case.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after this visit, I had the following dream, which was\r\nnotable on account of its form. It consisted of two thoughts and two\r\nimages, so that a thought and an image alternated. But I here record\r\nonly the first half of the dream, because the other half has nothing to\r\ndo with the purpose which the citation of the dream should serve.\r\n\r\nI. _Friend R. is my uncle\xe2\x80\x94I feel great affection for him._\r\n\r\nII. _I see before me his face somewhat altered._\r\n\r\n_It seems to be elongated; a yellow beard, which surrounds it, is\r\nemphasised with peculiar distinctness._\r\n\r\nThen follow the other two portions, again a thought and an image, which\r\nI omit.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of this dream was accomplished in the following\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\nAs the dream occurred to me in the course of the forenoon, I laughed\r\noutright and said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe dream is nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d But I could not get it out\r\nof my mind, and the whole day it pursued me, until, at last, in the\r\nevening I reproached myself with the words: \xe2\x80\x9cIf in the course of dream\r\ninterpretation one of your patients had nothing better to say than \xe2\x80\x98That\r\nis nonsense,\xe2\x80\x99 you would reprove him, and would suspect that behind the\r\ndream there was hidden some disagreeable affair, the exposure of which\r\nhe wanted to spare himself. Apply the same thing in your own case; your\r\nopinion that the dream is nonsense probably signifies merely an inner\r\nresistance to its interpretation. Do not let yourself be deterred.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nthen proceeded to the interpretation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cR. is my uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d What does that mean. I have had only one uncle, my\r\nuncle Joseph.[AF] His story, to be sure, was a sad one. He had yielded\r\nto the temptation, more than thirty years before, of engaging in\r\ndealings which the law punishes severely, and which on that occasion\r\nalso it had visited with punishment. My father, who thereupon became\r\ngrey from grief in a few days, always used to say that Uncle Joseph was\r\nnever a wicked man, but that he was indeed a simpleton; so he expressed\r\nhimself. If, then, friend R. is my uncle Joseph, that is equivalent to\r\nsaying: \xe2\x80\x9cR. is a simpleton.\xe2\x80\x9d Hardly credible and very unpleasant! But\r\nthere is that face which I see in the dream, with its long features and\r\nits yellow beard. My uncle actually had such a face\xe2\x80\x94long and surrounded\r\nby a handsome blond beard. My friend R. was quite dark, but when\r\ndark-haired persons begin to grow grey, they pay for the glory of their\r\nyouthful years. Their black beard undergoes an unpleasant change of\r\ncolor, each hair separately; first it becomes reddish brown, then\r\nyellowish brown, and then at last definitely grey. The beard of my\r\nfriend R. is now in this stage, as is my own moreover, a fact which I\r\nnotice with regret. The face which I see in the dream is at once that of\r\nmy friend R. and that of my uncle. It is like a composite photograph of\r\nGalton, who, in order to emphasise family resemblances, had several\r\nfaces photographed on the same plate. No doubt is thus possible, I am\r\nreally of the opinion that my friend R. is a simpleton\xe2\x80\x94like my uncle\r\nJoseph.\r\n\r\nI have still no idea for what purpose I have constructed this\r\nrelationship, to which I must unconditionally object. But it is not a\r\nvery far-reaching one, for my uncle was a criminal, my friend R. is\r\ninnocent\xe2\x80\x94perhaps with the exception of having been punished for knocking\r\ndown an apprentice with his bicycle. Could I mean this offence? That\r\nwould be making ridiculous comparisons. Here I recollect another\r\nconversation which I had with another colleague, N., and indeed upon the\r\nsame subject. I met N. on the street. He likewise has been nominated for\r\na professorship, and having heard of my being honoured, congratulated me\r\nupon it. I declined emphatically, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are the last man to make\r\na joke like this, because you have experienced what the nomination is\r\nworth in your own case.\xe2\x80\x9d Thereupon he said, though probably not in\r\nearnest, \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot be sure about that. Against me there is a very\r\nparticular objection. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that a woman once entered a legal\r\ncomplaint against me? I need not assure you that an inquiry was made; it\r\nwas a mean attempt at blackmail, and it was all I could do to save the\r\nplaintiff herself from punishment. But perhaps the affair will be\r\npressed against me at the office in order that I may not be appointed.\r\nYou, however, are above reproach.\xe2\x80\x9d Here I have come upon a criminal, and\r\nat the same time upon the interpretation and trend of the dream. My\r\nuncle Joseph represents for me both colleagues who have not been\r\nappointed to the professorship, the one as a simpleton, the other as a\r\ncriminal. I also know now for what purpose I need this representation.\r\nIf considerations of creed are a determining factor in the postponement\r\nof the appointment of my friends, then my own appointment is also put in\r\nquestion: but if I can refer the rejection of the two friends to other\r\ncauses, which do not apply to my case, my hope remains undisturbed. This\r\nis the procedure of my dream; it makes the one, R., a simpleton, the\r\nother, N., a criminal; since, however, I am neither the one nor the\r\nother, our community of interest is destroyed, I have a right to enjoy\r\nthe expectation of being appointed a professor, and have escaped the\r\npainful application to my own case of the information which the high\r\nofficial has given to R.\r\n\r\nI must occupy myself still further with the interpretation of this\r\ndream. For my feelings it is not yet sufficiently cleared up. I am still\r\ndisquieted by the ease with which I degrade two respected colleagues for\r\nthe purpose of clearing the way to the professorship for myself. My\r\ndissatisfaction with my procedure has indeed diminished since I have\r\nlearnt to evaluate statements made in dreams. I would argue against\r\nanyone who urged that I really consider R. a simpleton, and that I do\r\nnot credit N.\xe2\x80\x99s account of the blackmail affair. I do not believe either\r\nthat Irma has been made seriously ill by an injection given her by Otto\r\nwith a preparation of propyl. Here, as before, it is only the _wish that\r\nthe case may be as the dream expresses it_. The statement in which my\r\nwish is realised sounds less absurd in the second dream than in the\r\nfirst; it is made here with a more skilful utilisation of facts as\r\npoints of attachment, something like a well-constructed slander, where\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthere is something in it.\xe2\x80\x9d For my friend R. had at that time the vote\r\nof a professor from the department against him, and my friend N. had\r\nhimself unsuspectingly furnished me with the material for slander.\r\nNevertheless, I repeat, the dream seems to me to require further\r\nelucidation.\r\n\r\nI remember now that the dream contains still another portion which so\r\nfar our interpretation has not taken into account. After it occurs to me\r\nthat my friend R. is my uncle, I feel great affection for him. To whom\r\ndoes this feeling belong? For my uncle Joseph, of course, I have never\r\nhad any feelings of affection. For years my friend R. has been beloved\r\nand dear to me; but if I were to go to him and express my feelings for\r\nhim in terms which came anywhere near corresponding to the degree of\r\naffection in the dream, he would doubtless be surprised. My affection\r\nfor him seems untrue and exaggerated, something like my opinion of his\r\npsychic qualities, which I express by fusing his personality with that\r\nof my uncle; but it is exaggerated in an opposite sense. But now a new\r\nstate of affairs becomes evident to me. The affection in the dream does\r\nnot belong to the hidden content, to the thoughts behind the dream; it\r\nstands in opposition to this content; it is calculated to hide the\r\ninformation which interpretation may bring. Probably this is its very\r\npurpose. I recall with what resistance I applied myself to the work of\r\ninterpretation, how long I tried to postpone it, and how I declared the\r\ndream to be sheer nonsense. I know from my psychoanalytical treatments\r\nhow such condemnation is to be interpreted. It has no value as affording\r\ninformation, but only as the registration of an affect. If my little\r\ndaughter does not like an apple which is offered her, she asserts that\r\nthe apple has a bitter taste, without even having tasted it. If my\r\npatients act like the little girl, I know that it is a question of a\r\nnotion which they want to _suppress_. The same applies to my dream. I do\r\nnot want to interpret it because it contains something to which I\r\nobject. After the interpretation of the dream has been completed, I find\r\nout what it was I objected to; it was the assertion that R. is a\r\nsimpleton. I may refer the affection which I feel for R. not to the\r\nhidden dream thoughts, but rather to this unwillingness of mine. If my\r\ndream as compared with its hidden content is disfigured at this point,\r\nand is disfigured, moreover, into something opposite, then the apparent\r\naffection in the dream serves the purpose of disfigurement; or, in other\r\nwords, the disfigurement is here shown to be intended: it is a means of\r\ndissimulation. My dream thoughts contain an unfavourable reference to\r\nR.; in order that I may not become aware of it, its opposite, a feeling\r\nof affection for him, makes its way into the dream.\r\n\r\nThe fact here recognised might be of universal applicability. As the\r\nexamples in Section III. have shown, there are dreams which are\r\nundisguised wish-fulfilments. Wherever a wish-fulfilment is\r\nunrecognisable and concealed, there must be present a feeling of\r\nrepulsion towards this wish, and in consequence of this repulsion the\r\nwish is unable to gain expression except in a disfigured state. I shall\r\ntry to find a case in social life which is parallel to this occurrence\r\nin the inner psychic life. Where in social life can a similar\r\ndisfigurement of a psychic act be found? Only where two persons are in\r\nquestion, one of whom possesses a certain power, while the other must\r\nhave a certain consideration for this power. This second person will\r\nthen disfigure his psychic actions, or, as we may say, he will\r\ndissimulate. The politeness which I practise every day is largely\r\ndissimulation of this kind. If I interpret my dreams for the benefit of\r\nthe reader I am forced to make such distortions. The poet also complains\r\nabout such disfigurement:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cYou may not tell the best that you know to the youngsters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe political writer who has unpleasant truths to tell to the government\r\nfinds himself in the same position. If he tells them without reserve,\r\nthe government will suppress them\xe2\x80\x94subsequently in case of a verbal\r\nexpression of opinion, preventatively, if they are to be published in\r\nprint. The writer must fear _censure_; he therefore modifies and\r\ndisfigures the expression of his opinion. He finds himself compelled,\r\naccording to the sensitiveness of this censure, either to restrain\r\nhimself from certain particular forms of attack or to speak in allusion\r\ninstead of direct designations. Or he must disguise his objectionable\r\nstatement in a garb that seems harmless. He may, for instance, tell of\r\nan occurrence between two mandarins in the Orient, while he has the\r\nofficials of his own country in view. The stricter the domination of the\r\ncensor, the more extensive becomes the disguise, and often the more\r\nhumorous the means employed to put the reader back on the track of the\r\nreal meaning.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence between the phenomena of the censor and those of\r\ndream distortion, which may be traced in detail, justifies us in\r\nassuming similar conditions for both. We should then assume in each\r\nhuman being, as the primary cause of dream formation, two psychic forces\r\n(streams, systems), of which one constitutes the wish expressed by the\r\ndream, while the other acts as a censor upon this dream wish, and by\r\nmeans of this censoring forces a distortion of its expression. The only\r\nquestion is as to the basis of the authority of this second instance[AG]\r\nby virtue of which it may exercise its censorship. If we remember that\r\nthe hidden dream thoughts are not conscious before analysis, but that\r\nthe apparent dream content is remembered as conscious, we easily reach\r\nthe assumption that admittance to consciousness is the privilege of the\r\nsecond instance. Nothing can reach consciousness from the first system\r\nwhich has not first passed the second instance, and the second instance\r\nlets nothing pass without exercising its rights and forcing such\r\nalterations upon the candidate for admission to consciousness as are\r\npleasant to itself. We are here forming a very definite conception of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cessence\xe2\x80\x9d of consciousness; for us the state of becoming conscious\r\nis a particular psychic act, different from and independent of becoming\r\nfixed or of being conceived, and consciousness appears to us as an organ\r\nof sense, which perceives a content presented from another source. It\r\nmay be shown that psychopathology cannot possibly dispense with these\r\nfundamental assumptions. We may reserve a more thorough examination of\r\nthese for a later time.\r\n\r\nIf I keep in mind the idea of the two psychic instances and their\r\nrelations to consciousness, I find in the sphere of politics a very\r\nexact analogy for the extraordinary affection which I feel for my friend\r\nR., who suffers such degradation in the course of the dream\r\ninterpretation. I turn my attention to a political state in which a\r\nruler, jealous of his rights, and a live public opinion are in conflict\r\nwith each other. The people are indignant against an official whom they\r\nhate, and demand his dismissal; and in order not to show that he is\r\ncompelled to respect the public wish, the autocrat will expressly confer\r\nupon the official some great honour, for which there would otherwise\r\nhave been no occasion. Thus the second instance referred to, which\r\ncontrols access to consciousness, honours my friend R. with a profusion\r\nof extraordinary tenderness, because the wish activities of the first\r\nsystem, in accordance with a particular interest which they happen to be\r\npursuing, are inclined to put him down as a simpleton.[AH]\r\n\r\nPerhaps we shall now begin to suspect that dream interpretation is\r\ncapable of giving us hints about the structure of our psychic apparatus\r\nwhich we have thus far expected in vain from philosophy. We shall not,\r\nhowever, follow this track, but return to our original problem as soon\r\nas we have cleared up the subject of dream-disfigurement. The question\r\nhas arisen how dreams with disagreeable content can be analysed as the\r\nfulfilments of wishes. We see now that this is possible in case\r\ndream-disfigurement has taken place, in case the disagreeable content\r\nserves only as a disguise for what is wished. Keeping in mind our\r\nassumptions in regard to the two psychic instances, we may now proceed\r\nto say: disagreeable dreams, as a matter of fact, contain something\r\nwhich is disagreeable to the second instance, but which at the same time\r\nfulfils a wish of the first instance. They are wish dreams in the sense\r\nthat every dream originates in the first instance, while the second\r\ninstance acts towards the dream only in a repelling, not in a creative\r\nmanner. If we limit ourselves to a consideration of what the second\r\ninstance contributes to the dream, we can never understand the dream. If\r\nwe do so, all the riddles which the authors have found in the dream\r\nremain unsolved.\r\n\r\nThat the dream actually has a secret meaning, which turns out to be the\r\nfulfilment of a wish, must be proved afresh for every case by means of\r\nan analysis. I therefore select several dreams which have painful\r\ncontents and attempt an analysis of them. They are partly dreams of\r\nhysterical subjects, which require long preliminary statements, and now\r\nand then also an examination of the psychic processes which occur in\r\nhysteria. I cannot, however, avoid this added difficulty in the\r\nexposition.\r\n\r\nWhen I give a psychoneurotic patient analytical treatment, dreams are\r\nalways, as I have said, the subject of our discussion. It must,\r\ntherefore, give him all the psychological explanations through whose aid\r\nI myself have come to an understanding of his symptoms, and here I\r\nundergo an unsparing criticism, which is perhaps not less keen than that\r\nI must expect from my colleagues. Contradiction of the thesis that all\r\ndreams are the fulfilments of wishes is raised by my patients with\r\nperfect regularity. Here are several examples of the dream material\r\nwhich is offered me to refute this position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always tell me that the dream is a wish fulfilled,\xe2\x80\x9d begins a clever\r\nlady patient. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I shall tell you a dream in which the content is\r\nquite the opposite, in which a wish of mine is _not_ fulfilled. How do\r\nyou reconcile that with your theory? The dream is as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I want to give a supper, but having nothing at hand except some smoked\r\nsalmon, I think of going marketing, but I remember that it is Sunday\r\nafternoon, when all the shops are closed. I next try to telephone to\r\nsome caterers, but the telephone is out of order. Thus I must resign my\r\nwish to give a supper._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI answer, of course, that only the analysis can decide the meaning of\r\nthis dream, although I admit that at first sight it seems sensible and\r\ncoherent, and looks like the opposite of a wish-fulfilment. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what\r\noccurrence has given rise to this dream?\xe2\x80\x9d I ask. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know that the\r\nstimulus for a dream always lies among the experiences of the preceding\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_Analysis._\xe2\x80\x94The husband of the patient, an upright and conscientious\r\nwholesale butcher, had told her the day before that he is growing too\r\nfat, and that he must, therefore, begin treatment for obesity. He was\r\ngoing to get up early, take exercise, keep to a strict diet, and above\r\nall accept no more invitations to suppers. She proceeds laughingly to\r\nrelate how her husband at an inn table had made the acquaintance of an\r\nartist, who insisted upon painting his portrait because he, the painter,\r\nhad never found such an expressive head. But her husband had answered in\r\nhis rough way, that he was very thankful for the honour, but that he was\r\nquite convinced that a portion of the backside of a pretty young girl\r\nwould please the artist better than his whole face.[AI] She said that\r\nshe was at the time very much in love with her husband, and teased him a\r\ngood deal. She had also asked him not to send her any caviare. What does\r\nthat mean?\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, she had wanted for a long time to eat a caviare\r\nsandwich every forenoon, but had grudged herself the expense. Of course,\r\nshe would at once get the caviare from her husband, as soon as she asked\r\nhim for it. But she had begged him, on the contrary, not to send her the\r\ncaviare, in order that she might tease him about it longer.\r\n\r\nThis explanation seems far-fetched to me. Unadmitted motives are in the\r\nhabit of hiding behind such unsatisfactory explanations. We are reminded\r\nof subjects hypnotised by Bernheim, who carried out a posthypnotic\r\norder, and who, upon being asked for their motives, instead of\r\nanswering: \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know why I did that,\xe2\x80\x9d had to invent a reason that\r\nwas obviously inadequate. Something similar is probably the case with\r\nthe caviare of my patient. I see that she is compelled to create an\r\nunfulfilled wish in life. Her dream also shows the reproduction of the\r\nwish as accomplished. But why does she need an unfulfilled wish?\r\n\r\nThe ideas so far produced are insufficient for the interpretation of the\r\ndream. I beg for more. After a short pause, which corresponds to the\r\novercoming of a resistance, she reports further that the day before she\r\nhad made a visit to a friend, of whom she is really jealous, because her\r\nhusband is always praising this woman so much. Fortunately, this friend\r\nis very lean and thin, and her husband likes well-rounded figures. Now\r\nof what did this lean friend speak? Naturally of her wish to become\r\nsomewhat stouter. She also asked my patient: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you going to\r\ninvite us again? You always have such a good table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow the meaning of the dream is clear. I may say to the patient: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\njust as though you had thought at the time of the request: \xe2\x80\x98Of course,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll invite you, so you can eat yourself fat at my house and become\r\nstill more pleasing to my husband. I would rather give no more suppers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThe dream then tells you that you cannot give a supper, thereby\r\nfulfilling your wish not to contribute anything to the rounding out of\r\nyour friend\xe2\x80\x99s figure. The resolution of your husband to refuse\r\ninvitations to supper for the sake of getting thin teaches you that one\r\ngrows fat on the things served in company.\xe2\x80\x9d Now only some conversation\r\nis necessary to confirm the solution. The smoked salmon in the dream has\r\nnot yet been traced. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did the salmon mentioned in the dream occur to\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSmoked salmon is the favourite dish of this friend,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nanswered. I happen to know the lady, and may corroborate this by saying\r\nthat she grudges herself the salmon just as much as my patient grudges\r\nherself the caviare.\r\n\r\nThe dream admits of still another and more exact interpretation, which\r\nis necessitated only by a subordinate circumstance. The two\r\ninterpretations do not contradict one another, but rather cover each\r\nother and furnish a neat example of the usual ambiguity of dreams as\r\nwell as of all other psychopathological formations. We have seen that at\r\nthe same time that she dreams of the denial of the wish, the patient is\r\nin reality occupied in securing an unfulfilled wish (the caviare\r\nsandwiches). Her friend, too, had expressed a wish, namely, to get\r\nfatter, and it would not surprise us if our lady had dreamt that the\r\nwish of the friend was not being fulfilled. For it is her own wish that\r\na wish of her friend\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94for increase in weight\xe2\x80\x94should not be fulfilled.\r\nInstead of this, however, she dreams that one of her own wishes is not\r\nfulfilled. The dream becomes capable of a new interpretation, if in the\r\ndream she does not intend herself, but her friend, if she has put\r\nherself in the place of her friend, or, as we may say, has identified\r\nherself with her friend.\r\n\r\nI think she has actually done this, and as a sign of this identification\r\nshe has created an unfulfilled wish in reality. But what is the meaning\r\nof this hysterical identification? To clear this up a thorough\r\nexposition is necessary. Identification is a highly important factor in\r\nthe mechanism of hysterical symptoms; by this means patients are enabled\r\nin their symptoms to represent not merely their own experiences, but the\r\nexperiences of a great number of other persons, and can suffer, as it\r\nwere, for a whole mass of people, and fill all the parts of a drama by\r\nmeans of their own personalities alone. It will here be objected that\r\nthis is well-known hysterical imitation, the ability of hysteric\r\nsubjects to copy all the symptoms which impress them when they occur in\r\nothers, as though their pity were stimulated to the point of\r\nreproduction. But this only indicates the way in which the psychic\r\nprocess is discharged in hysterical imitation; the way in which a\r\npsychic act proceeds and the act itself are two different things. The\r\nlatter is slightly more complicated than one is apt to imagine the\r\nimitation of hysterical subjects to be: it corresponds to an unconscious\r\nconcluded process, as an example will show. The physician who has a\r\nfemale patient with a particular kind of twitching, lodged in the\r\ncompany of other patients in the same room of the hospital, is not\r\nsurprised when some morning he learns that this peculiar hysterical\r\nattack has found imitations. He simply says to himself: The others have\r\nseen her and have done likewise: that is psychic infection. Yes, but\r\npsychic infection proceeds in somewhat the following manner: As a rule,\r\npatients know more about one another than the physician knows about each\r\nof them, and they are concerned about each other when the visit of the\r\ndoctor is over. Some of them have an attack to-day: soon it is known\r\namong the rest that a letter from home, a return of love-sickness or the\r\nlike, is the cause of it. Their sympathy is aroused, and the following\r\nsyllogism, which does not reach consciousness, is completed in them: \xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nit is possible to have this kind of an attack from such causes, I too\r\nmay have this kind of an attack, for I have the same reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d If this\r\nwere a cycle capable of becoming conscious, it would perhaps express\r\nitself in _fear_ of getting the same attack; but it takes place in\r\nanother psychic sphere, and, therefore, ends in the realisation of the\r\ndreaded symptom. Identification is therefore not a simple imitation, but\r\na sympathy based upon the same etiological claim; it expresses an \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nthough,\xe2\x80\x9d and refers to some common quality which has remained in the\r\nunconscious.\r\n\r\nIdentification is most often used in hysteria to express sexual\r\ncommunity. An hysterical woman identifies herself most readily\xe2\x80\x94although\r\nnot exclusively\xe2\x80\x94with persons with whom she has had sexual relations, or\r\nwho have sexual intercourse with the same persons as herself. Language\r\ntakes such a conception into consideration: two lovers are \xe2\x80\x9cone.\xe2\x80\x9d In the\r\nhysterical phantasy, as well as in the dream, it is sufficient for the\r\nidentification if one thinks of sexual relations, whether or not they\r\nbecome real. The patient, then, only follows the rules of the hysterical\r\nthought processes when she gives expression to her jealousy of her\r\nfriend (which, moreover, she herself admits to be unjustified, in that\r\nshe puts herself in her place and identifies herself with her by\r\ncreating a symptom\xe2\x80\x94the denied wish). I might further clarify the process\r\nspecifically as follows: She puts herself in the place of her friend in\r\nthe dream, because her friend has taken her own place in relation to her\r\nhusband, and because she would like to take her friend\xe2\x80\x99s place in the\r\nesteem of her husband.[AJ]\r\n\r\nThe contradiction to my theory of dreams in the case of another female\r\npatient, the most witty among all my dreamers, was solved in a simpler\r\nmanner, although according to the scheme that the non-fulfilment of one\r\nwish signifies the fulfilment of another. I had one day explained to her\r\nthat the dream is a wish-fulfilment. The next day she brought me a dream\r\nto the effect that she was travelling with her mother-inlaw to their\r\ncommon summer resort. Now I knew that she had struggled violently\r\nagainst spending the summer in the neighbourhood of her mother-in-law. I\r\nalso knew that she had luckily avoided her mother-in-law by renting an\r\nestate in a far-distant country resort. Now the dream reversed this\r\nwished-for solution; was not this in the flattest contradiction to my\r\ntheory of wish-fulfilment in the dream? Certainly, it was only necessary\r\nto draw the inferences from this dream in order to get at its\r\ninterpretation. According to this dream, I was in the wrong. _It was\r\nthus her wish that I should be in the wrong, and this wish the dream\r\nshowed her as fulfilled._ But the wish that I should be in the wrong,\r\nwhich was fulfilled in the theme of the country home, referred to a more\r\nserious matter. At that time I had made up my mind, from the material\r\nfurnished by her analysis, that something of significance for her\r\nillness must have occurred at a certain time in her life. She had denied\r\nit because it was not present in her memory. We soon came to see that I\r\nwas in the right. Her wish that I should be in the wrong, which is\r\ntransformed into the dream, thus corresponded to the justifiable wish\r\nthat those things, which at the time had only been suspected, had never\r\noccurred at all.\r\n\r\nWithout an analysis, and merely by means of an assumption, I took the\r\nliberty of interpreting a little occurrence in the case of a friend, who\r\nhad been my colleague through the eight classes of the Gymnasium. He\r\nonce heard a lecture of mine delivered to a small assemblage, on the\r\nnovel subject of the dream as the fulfilment of a wish. He went home,\r\ndreamt _that he had lost all his suits_\xe2\x80\x94he was a lawyer\xe2\x80\x94and then\r\ncomplained to me about it. I took refuge in the evasion: \xe2\x80\x9cOne can\xe2\x80\x99t win\r\nall one\xe2\x80\x99s suits,\xe2\x80\x9d but I thought to myself: \xe2\x80\x9cIf for eight years I sat as\r\nPrimus on the first bench, while he moved around somewhere in the middle\r\nof the class, may he not naturally have had a wish from his boyhood days\r\nthat I, too, might for once completely disgrace myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the same way another dream of a more gloomy character was offered me\r\nby a female patient as a contradiction to my theory of the wish-dream.\r\nThe patient, a young girl, began as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cYou remember that my\r\nsister has now only one boy, Charles: she lost the elder one, Otto,\r\nwhile I was still at her house. Otto was my favourite; it was I who\r\nreally brought him up. I like the other little fellow, too, but of\r\ncourse not nearly as much as the dead one. Now I dreamt last night that\r\n_I saw Charles lying dead before me_. _He was lying in his little\r\ncoffin, his hands folded: there were candles all about, and, in short,\r\nit was just like the time of little Otto\xe2\x80\x99s death, which shocked me so\r\nprofoundly._ Now tell me, what does this mean? You know me: am I really\r\nbad enough to wish my sister to lose the only child she has left? Or\r\ndoes the dream mean that I wish Charles to be dead rather than Otto,\r\nwhom I like so much better?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI assured her that this interpretation was impossible. After some\r\nreflection I was able to give her the interpretation of the dream, which\r\nI subsequently made her confirm.\r\n\r\nHaving become an orphan at an early age, the girl had been brought up in\r\nthe house of a much older sister, and had met among the friends and\r\nvisitors who came to the house, a man who made a lasting impression upon\r\nher heart. It looked for a time as though these barely expressed\r\nrelations were to end in marriage, but this happy culmination was\r\nfrustrated by the sister, whose motives have never found a complete\r\nexplanation. After the break, the man who was loved by our patient\r\navoided the house: she herself became independent some time after little\r\nOtto\xe2\x80\x99s death, to whom her affection had now turned. But she did not\r\nsucceed in freeing herself from the inclination for her sister\xe2\x80\x99s friend\r\nin which she had become involved. Her pride commanded her to avoid him;\r\nbut it was impossible for her to transfer her love to the other suitors\r\nwho presented themselves in order. Whenever the man whom she loved, who\r\nwas a member of the literary profession, announced a lecture anywhere,\r\nshe was sure to be found in the audience; she also seized every other\r\nopportunity to see him from a distance unobserved by him. I remembered\r\nthat on the day before she had told me that the Professor was going to a\r\ncertain concert, and that she was also going there, in order to enjoy\r\nthe sight of him. This was on the day of the dream; and the concert was\r\nto take place on the day on which she told me the dream. I could now\r\neasily see the correct interpretation, and I asked her whether she could\r\nthink of any event which had happened after the death of little Otto.\r\nShe answered immediately: \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; at that time the Professor\r\nreturned after a long absence, and I saw him once more beside the coffin\r\nof little Otto.\xe2\x80\x9d It was exactly as I had expected. I interpreted the\r\ndream in the following manner: If now the other boy were to die, the\r\nsame thing would be repeated. You would spend the day with your sister,\r\nthe Professor would surely come in order to offer condolence, and you\r\nwould see him again under the same circumstances as at that time. The\r\ndream signifies nothing but this wish of yours to see him again, against\r\nwhich you are fighting inwardly. I know that you are carrying the ticket\r\nfor to-day\xe2\x80\x99s concert in your bag. Your dream is a dream of impatience;\r\nit has anticipated the meeting which is to take place to-day by several\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nIn order to disguise her wish she had obviously selected a situation in\r\nwhich wishes of that sort are commonly suppressed\xe2\x80\x94a situation which is\r\nso filled with sorrow that love is not thought of. And yet, it is very\r\neasily probable that even in the actual situation at the bier of the\r\nsecond, more dearly loved boy, which the dream copied faithfully, she\r\nhad not been able to suppress her feelings of affection for the visitor\r\nwhom she had missed for so long a time.\r\n\r\nA different explanation was found in the case of a similar dream of\r\nanother female patient, who was distinguished in her earlier years by\r\nher quick wit and her cheerful demeanour, and who still showed these\r\nqualities at least in the notions which occurred to her in the course of\r\ntreatment. In connection with a longer dream, it seemed to this lady\r\nthat she saw her fifteen-year-old daughter lying dead before her in a\r\nbox. She was strongly inclined to convert this dream-image into an\r\nobjection to the theory of wish-fulfilment, but herself suspected that\r\nthe detail of the box must lead to a different conception of the\r\ndream.[AK] In the course of the analysis it occurred to her that on the\r\nevening before, the conversation of the company had turned upon the\r\nEnglish word \xe2\x80\x9cbox,\xe2\x80\x9d and upon the numerous translations of it into\r\nGerman, such as box, theatre box, chest, box on the ear, &c. From other\r\ncomponents of the same dream it is now possible to add that the lady had\r\nguessed the relationship between the English word \xe2\x80\x9cbox\xe2\x80\x9d and the German\r\n_B\xc3\xbcchse_, and had then been haunted by the memory that _B\xc3\xbcchse_ (as well\r\nas \xe2\x80\x9cbox\xe2\x80\x9d) is used in vulgar speech to designate the female genital\r\norgan. It was therefore possible, making a certain allowance for her\r\nnotions on the subject of topographical anatomy, to assume that the\r\nchild in the box signified a child in the womb of the mother. At this\r\nstage of the explanation she no longer denied that the picture of the\r\ndream really corresponded to one of her wishes. Like so many other young\r\nwomen, she was by no means happy when she became pregnant, and admitted\r\nto me more than once the wish that her child might die before its birth;\r\nin a fit of anger following a violent scene with her husband she had\r\neven struck her abdomen with her fists in order to hit the child within.\r\nThe dead child was, therefore, really the fulfilment of a wish, but a\r\nwish which had been put aside for fifteen years, and it is not\r\nsurprising that the fulfilment of the wish was no longer recognised\r\nafter so long an interval. For there had been many changes meanwhile.\r\n\r\nThe group of dreams to which the two last mentioned belong, having as\r\ncontent the death of beloved relatives, will be considered again under\r\nthe head of \xe2\x80\x9cTypical Dreams.\xe2\x80\x9d I shall there be able to show by new\r\nexamples that in spite of their undesirable content, all these dreams\r\nmust be interpreted as wish-fulfilments. For the following dream, which\r\nagain was told me in order to deter me from a hasty generalisation of\r\nthe theory of wishing in dreams, I am indebted, not to a patient, but to\r\nan intelligent jurist of my acquaintance. \xe2\x80\x9c_I dream_,\xe2\x80\x9d my informant\r\ntells me, \xe2\x80\x9c_that I am walking in front of my house with a lady on my\r\narm_. _Here a closed wagon is waiting, a gentleman steps up to me, gives\r\nhis authority as an agent of the police, and demands that I should\r\nfollow him. I only ask for time in which to arrange my affairs._ Can you\r\npossibly suppose this is a wish of mine to be arrested?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOf course\r\nnot,\xe2\x80\x9d I must admit. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you happen to know upon what charge you were\r\narrested?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes; I believe for infanticide.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cInfanticide? But you know\r\nthat only a mother can commit this crime upon her newly born child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true.\xe2\x80\x9d[AL] \xe2\x80\x9cAnd under what circumstances did you dream; what\r\nhappened on the evening before?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather not tell you that; it\r\nis a delicate matter.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut I must have it, otherwise we must forgo the\r\ninterpretation of the dream.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I will tell you. I spent the\r\nnight, not at home, but at the house of a lady who means very much to\r\nme. When we awoke in the morning, something again passed between us.\r\nThen I went to sleep again, and dreamt what I have told you.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe woman\r\nis married?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you do not wish her to conceive a child?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo;\r\nthat might betray us.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThen you do not practise normal coitus?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI take\r\nthe precaution to withdraw before ejaculation.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAm I permitted to\r\nassume that you did this trick several times during the night, and that\r\nin the morning you were not quite sure whether you had succeeded?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nmight be the case.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThen your dream is the fulfilment of a wish. By\r\nmeans of it you secure the assurance that you have not begotten a child,\r\nor, what amounts to the same thing, that you have killed a child. I can\r\neasily demonstrate the connecting links. Do you remember, a few days ago\r\nwe were talking about the distress of matrimony (Ehenot), and about the\r\ninconsistency of permitting the practice of coitus as long as no\r\nimpregnation takes place, while every delinquency after the ovum and the\r\nsemen meet and a f\xc5\x93tus is formed is punished as a crime? In connection\r\nwith this, we also recalled the medi\xc3\xa6val controversy about the moment of\r\ntime at which the soul is really lodged in the f\xc5\x93tus, since the concept\r\nof murder becomes admissible only from that point on. Doubtless you also\r\nknow the gruesome poem by Lenau, which puts infanticide and the\r\nprevention of children on the same plane.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cStrangely enough, I had\r\nhappened to think of Lenau during the afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnother echo of your\r\ndream. And now I shall demonstrate to you another subordinate\r\nwish-fulfilment in your dream. You walk in front of your house with the\r\nlady on your arm. So you take her home, instead of spending the night at\r\nher house, as you do in actuality. The fact that the wish-fulfilment,\r\nwhich is the essence of the dream, disguises itself in such an\r\nunpleasant form, has perhaps more than one reason. From my essay on the\r\netiology of anxiety neuroses, you will see that I note interrupted\r\ncoitus as one of the factors which cause the development of neurotic\r\nfear. It would be consistent with this that if after repeated\r\ncohabitation of the kind mentioned you should be left in an\r\nuncomfortable mood, which now becomes an element in the composition of\r\nyour dream. You also make use of this unpleasant state of mind to\r\nconceal the wish-fulfilment. Furthermore, the mention of infanticide has\r\nnot yet been explained. Why does this crime, which is peculiar to\r\nfemales, occur to you?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI shall confess to you that I was involved in\r\nsuch an affair years ago. Through my fault a girl tried to protect\r\nherself from the consequences of a _liaison_ with me by securing an\r\nabortion. I had nothing to do with carrying out the plan, but I was\r\nnaturally for a long time worried lest the affair might be discovered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand; this recollection furnished a second reason why the\r\nsupposition that you had done your trick badly must have been painful to\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA young physician, who had heard this dream of my colleague when it was\r\ntold, must have felt implicated by it, for he hastened to imitate it in\r\na dream of his own, applying its mode of thinking to another subject.\r\nThe day before he had handed in a declaration of his income, which was\r\nperfectly honest, because he had little to declare. He dreamt that an\r\nacquaintance of his came from a meeting of the tax commission and\r\ninformed him that all the other declarations of income had passed\r\nuncontested, but that his own had awakened general suspicion, and that\r\nhe would be punished with a heavy fine. The dream is a poorly-concealed\r\nfulfilment of the wish to be known as a physician with a large income.\r\nIt likewise recalls the story of the young girl who was advised against\r\naccepting her suitor because he was a man of quick temper who would\r\nsurely treat her to blows after they were married. The answer of the\r\ngirl was: \xe2\x80\x9cI wish he _would_ strike me!\xe2\x80\x9d Her wish to be married is so\r\nstrong that she takes into the bargain the discomfort which is said to\r\nbe connected with matrimony, and which is predicted for her, and even\r\nraises it to a wish.\r\n\r\nIf I group the very frequently occurring dreams of this sort, which seem\r\nflatly to contradict my theory, in that they contain the denial of a\r\nwish or some occurrence decidedly unwished for, under the head of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccounter wish-dreams,\xe2\x80\x9d I observe that they may all be referred to two\r\nprinciples, of which one has not yet been mentioned, although it plays a\r\nlarge part in the dreams of human beings. One of the motives inspiring\r\nthese dreams is the wish that I should appear in the wrong. These dreams\r\nregularly occur in the course of my treatment if the patient shows a\r\nresistance against me, and I can count with a large degree of certainty\r\nupon causing such a dream after I have once explained to the patient my\r\ntheory that the dream is a wish-fulfilment.[AM] I may even expect this\r\nto be the case in a dream merely in order to fulfil the wish that I may\r\nappear in the wrong. The last dream which I shall tell from those\r\noccurring in the course of treatment again shows this very thing. A\r\nyoung girl who has struggled hard to continue my treatment, against the\r\nwill of her relatives and the authorities whom she has consulted, dreams\r\nas follows: _She is forbidden at home to come to me any more. She then\r\nreminds me of the promise I made her to treat her for nothing if\r\nnecessary, and I say to her: \xe2\x80\x9cI can show no consideration in money\r\nmatters.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nIt is not at all easy in this case to demonstrate the fulfilment of a\r\nwish, but in all cases of this kind there is a second problem, the\r\nsolution of which helps also to solve the first. Where does she get the\r\nwords which she puts into my mouth? Of course I have never told her\r\nanything like that, but one of her brothers, the very one who has the\r\ngreatest influence over her, has been kind enough to make this remark\r\nabout me. It is then the purpose of the dream that this brother should\r\nremain in the right; and she does not try to justify this brother merely\r\nin the dream; it is her purpose in life and the motive for her being\r\nill.\r\n\r\nThe other motive for counter wish-dreams is so clear that there is\r\ndanger of overlooking it, as for some time happened in my own case. In\r\nthe sexual make-up of many people there is a masochistic component,\r\nwhich has arisen through the conversion of the aggressive, sadistic\r\ncomponent into its opposite. Such people are called \xe2\x80\x9cideal\xe2\x80\x9d masochists,\r\nif they seek pleasure not in the bodily pain which may be inflicted upon\r\nthem, but in humiliation and in chastisement of the soul. It is obvious\r\nthat such persons can have counter wish-dreams and disagreeable dreams,\r\nwhich, however, for them are nothing but wish-fulfilments, affording\r\nsatisfaction for their masochistic inclinations. Here is such a dream. A\r\nyoung man, who has in earlier years tormented his elder brother, towards\r\nwhom he was homosexually inclined, but who has undergone a complete\r\nchange of character, has the following dream, which consists of three\r\nparts: (1) _He is \xe2\x80\x9cinsulted\xe2\x80\x9d by his brother._ (2) _Two adults are\r\ncaressing each other with homosexual intentions._ (3) _His brother has\r\nsold the enterprise whose management the young man reserved for his own\r\nfuture._ He awakens from the last-mentioned dream with the most\r\nunpleasant feelings, and yet it is a masochistic wish-dream, which might\r\nbe translated: It would serve me quite right if my brother were to make\r\nthat sale against my interest, as a punishment for all the torments\r\nwhich he has suffered at my hands.\r\n\r\nI hope that the above discussion and examples will suffice\xe2\x80\x94until further\r\nobjection can be raised\xe2\x80\x94to make it seem credible that even dreams with a\r\npainful content are to be analysed as the fulfilments of wishes. Nor\r\nwill it seem a matter of chance that in the course of interpretation one\r\nalways happens upon subjects of which one does not like to speak or\r\nthink. The disagreeable sensation which such dreams arouse is simply\r\nidentical with the antipathy which endeavours\xe2\x80\x94usually with success\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nrestrain us from the treatment or discussion of such subjects, and which\r\nmust be overcome by all of us, if, in spite of its unpleasantness, we\r\nfind it necessary to take the matter in hand. But this disagreeable\r\nsensation, which occurs also in dreams, does not preclude the existence\r\nof a wish; everyone has wishes which he would not like to tell to\r\nothers, which he does not want to admit even to himself. We are, on\r\nother grounds, justified in connecting the disagreeable character of all\r\nthese dreams with the fact of dream disfigurement, and in concluding\r\nthat these dreams are distorted, and that the wish-fulfilment in them is\r\ndisguised until recognition is impossible for no other reason than that\r\na repugnance, a will to suppress, exists in relation to the\r\nsubject-matter of the dream or in relation to the wish which the dream\r\ncreates. Dream disfigurement, then, turns out in reality to be an act of\r\nthe censor. We shall take into consideration everything which the\r\nanalysis of disagreeable dreams has brought to light if we reword our\r\nformula as follows: _The dream is the (disguised) fulfilment of a\r\n(suppressed, repressed) wish._[AN]\r\n\r\nNow there still remain as a particular species of dreams with painful\r\ncontent, dreams of anxiety, the inclusion of which under dreams of\r\nwishing will find least acceptance with the uninitiated. But I can\r\nsettle the problem of anxiety dreams in very short order; for what they\r\nmay reveal is not a new aspect of the dream problem; it is a question in\r\ntheir case of understanding neurotic anxiety in general. The fear which\r\nwe experience in the dream is only seemingly explained by the dream\r\ncontent. If we subject the content of the dream to analysis, we become\r\naware that the dream fear is no more justified by the dream content than\r\nthe fear in a phobia is justified by the idea upon which the phobia\r\ndepends. For example, it is true that it is possible to fall out of a\r\nwindow, and that some care must be exercised when one is near a window,\r\nbut it is inexplicable why the anxiety in the corresponding phobia is so\r\ngreat, and why it follows its victims to an extent so much greater than\r\nis warranted by its origin. The same explanation, then, which applies to\r\nthe phobia applies also to the dream of anxiety. In both cases the\r\nanxiety is only superficially attached to the idea which accompanies it\r\nand comes from another source.\r\n\r\nOn account of the intimate relation of dream fear to neurotic fear,\r\ndiscussion of the former obliges me to refer to the latter. In a little\r\nessay on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Anxiety Neurosis,\xe2\x80\x9d[AO] I maintained that neurotic fear has\r\nits origin in the sexual life, and corresponds to a libido which has\r\nbeen turned away from its object and has not succeeded in being applied.\r\nFrom this formula, which has since proved its validity more and more\r\nclearly, we may deduce the conclusion that the content of anxiety dreams\r\nis of a sexual nature, the libido belonging to which content has been\r\ntransformed into fear. Later on I shall have opportunity to support this\r\nassertion by the analysis of several dreams of neurotics. I shall have\r\noccasion to revert to the determinations in anxiety dreams and their\r\ncompatibility with the theory of wish-fulfilment when I again attempt to\r\napproach the theory of dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n                   THE MATERIAL AND SOURCES OF DREAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter coming to realise from the analysis of the dream of Irma\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninjection that the dream is the fulfilment of a wish, our interest was\r\nnext directed to ascertaining whether we had thus discovered a universal\r\ncharacteristic of the dream, and for the time being we put aside every\r\nother question which may have been aroused in the course of that\r\ninterpretation. Now that we have reached the goal upon one of these\r\npaths, we may turn back and select a new starting-point for our\r\nexcursions among the problems of the dream, even though we may lose\r\nsight for a time of the theme of wish-fulfilment, which has been as yet\r\nby no means exhaustively treated.\r\n\r\nNow that we are able, by applying our process of interpretation, to\r\ndiscover a _latent_ dream content which far surpasses the _manifest_\r\ndream content in point of significance, we are impelled to take up the\r\nindividual dream problems afresh, in order to see whether the riddles\r\nand contradictions which seemed, when we had only the manifest content,\r\nbeyond our reach may not be solved for us satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nThe statements of the authors concerning the relation of the dream to\r\nwaking life, as well as concerning the source of the dream material,\r\nhave been given at length in the introductory chapter. We may recall\r\nthat there are three peculiarities of recollection in the dreams, which\r\nhave been often remarked but never explained:\r\n\r\n1. That the dream distinctly prefers impressions of the few days\r\npreceding; (Robert,[55] Str\xc3\xbcmpell,[66] Hildebrandt,[35] also Weed-Hallam\r\n[33]).\r\n\r\n2. That it makes its selection according to principles other than those\r\nof our waking memory, in that it recalls not what is essential and\r\nimportant, but what is subordinate and disregarded (_cf._ p. 13).\r\n\r\n3. That it has at its disposal the earliest impressions of our\r\nchildhood, and brings to light details from this period of life which\r\nagain seem trivial to us, and which in waking life were considered long\r\nago forgotten.[AP]\r\n\r\nThese peculiarities in the selection of the dream material have of\r\ncourse been observed by the authors in connection with the manifest\r\ndream content.\r\n\r\n\r\n        (_a_) _Recent and Indifferent Impressions in the Dream_\r\n\r\nIf I now consult my own experience concerning the source of the elements\r\nwhich appear in the dream, I must at once express the opinion that some\r\nreference to the experiences of _the day which has most recently passed_\r\nis to be found in every dream. Whatever dream I take up, whether my own\r\nor another\xe2\x80\x99s, this experience is always reaffirmed. Knowing this fact, I\r\ncan usually begin the work of interpretation by trying to learn the\r\nexperience of the previous day which has stimulated the dream; for many\r\ncases, indeed, this is the quickest way. In the case of the two dreams\r\nwhich I have subjected to close analysis in the preceding chapter (of\r\nIrma\xe2\x80\x99s injection, and of my uncle with the yellow beard) the reference\r\nto the previous day is so obvious that it needs no further elucidation.\r\nBut in order to show that this reference may be regularly demonstrated,\r\nI shall examine a portion of my own dream chronicle. I shall report the\r\ndreams only so far as is necessary for the discovery of the dream\r\nstimulus in question.\r\n\r\n1. I make a visit at a house where I am admitted only with difficulty,\r\n&c., and meanwhile I keep a woman _waiting_ for me.\r\n\r\n_Source._\xe2\x80\x94A conversation in the evening with a female relative to the\r\neffect that she would have to _wait_ for some aid which she demanded\r\nuntil, &c.\r\n\r\n2. I have written a _monograph_ about a certain (obscure) species of\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n_Source._\xe2\x80\x94I have seen in the show-window of a book store a _monograph_\r\nupon the genus cyclamen.\r\n\r\n3. I see two women on the street, _mother and daughter_, the latter of\r\nwhom is my patient.\r\n\r\n_Source._\xe2\x80\x94A female patient who is under treatment has told me what\r\ndifficulties her _mother_ puts in the way of her continuing the\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n4. At the book store of S. and R. I subscribe to a periodical which\r\ncosts _20 florins_ annually.\r\n\r\n_Source._\xe2\x80\x94During the day my wife has reminded me that I still owe her\r\n_20 florins_ of her weekly allowance.\r\n\r\n5. I receive a _communication_, in which I am treated as a member, from\r\nthe Social Democratic Committee.\r\n\r\n_Source._\xe2\x80\x94I have received _communications_ simultaneously from the\r\nLiberal Committee on Elections and from the president of the\r\nHumanitarian Society, of which I am really a member.\r\n\r\n6. A man on _a steep rock in the middle of the ocean_, after the manner\r\nof Boecklin.\r\n\r\n_Source._\xe2\x80\x94_Dreyfus on Devil\xe2\x80\x99s Island_; at the same time news from my\r\nrelatives in _England_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe question might be raised, whether the dream is invariably connected\r\nwith the events of the previous day, or whether the reference may be\r\nextended to impressions from a longer space of time in the immediate\r\npast. Probably this matter cannot claim primary importance, but I should\r\nlike to decide in favour of the exclusive priority of the day before the\r\ndream (the dream-day). As often as I thought I had found a case where an\r\nimpression of two or three days before had been the source of the dream,\r\nI could convince myself, after careful investigation, that this\r\nimpression had been remembered the day before, that a demonstrable\r\nreproduction had been interpolated between the day of the event and the\r\ntime of the dream, and, furthermore, I was able to point out the recent\r\noccasion upon which the recollection of the old impression might have\r\noccurred. On the other hand, I was unable to convince myself that a\r\nregular interval (H. Swoboda calls the first one of this kind eighteen\r\nhours) of biological significance occurs between the stimulating\r\nimpression of the day and its repetition in the dream.[AQ]\r\n\r\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the stimulus for every dream is to\r\nbe found among those experiences \xe2\x80\x9cupon which one has not yet slept\xe2\x80\x9d for\r\na night.\r\n\r\nThus the impressions of the immediate past (with the exception of the\r\nday before the night of the dream) stand in no different relation to the\r\ndream content from those of times which are as far removed in the past\r\nas you please. The dream may select its material from all times of life,\r\nprovided only, that a chain of thought starting from one of the\r\nexperiences of the day of the dream (one of the \xe2\x80\x9crecent\xe2\x80\x9d impressions)\r\nreaches back to these earlier ones.\r\n\r\nBut why this preference for recent impressions? We shall reach some\r\nconjectures on this point if we subject one of the dreams already\r\nmentioned to a more exact analysis. I select the dream about the\r\nmonograph.\r\n\r\n_Content of the dream.\xe2\x80\x94I have written a monograph upon a certain plant.\r\nThe book lies before me, I am just turning over a folded coloured plate.\r\nA dried specimen of the plant is bound with every copy, as though from a\r\nherbarium._\r\n\r\n_Analysis._\xe2\x80\x94In the forenoon I saw in the show-window of a book store a\r\nbook entitled, _The Genus Cyclamen_, apparently a monograph on this\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThe cyclamen is the favourite flower of my wife. I reproach myself for\r\nso seldom thinking to bring her flowers, as she wishes. In connection\r\nwith the theme \xe2\x80\x9cbringing flowers,\xe2\x80\x9d I am reminded of a story which I\r\nrecently told in a circle of friends to prove my assertion that\r\nforgetting is very often the purpose of the unconscious, and that in any\r\ncase it warrants a conclusion as to the secret disposition of the person\r\nwho forgets. A young woman who is accustomed to receive a bunch of\r\nflowers from her husband on her birthday, misses this token of affection\r\non a festive occasion of this sort, and thereupon bursts into tears. The\r\nhusband comes up, and is unable to account for her tears until she tells\r\nhim, \xe2\x80\x9cTo-day is my birthday.\xe2\x80\x9d He strikes his forehead and cries, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I\r\nhad completely forgotten it,\xe2\x80\x9d and wants to go out to get her some\r\nflowers. But she is not to be consoled, for she sees in the\r\nforgetfulness of her husband a proof that she does not play the same\r\npart in his thoughts as formerly. This Mrs. L. met my wife two days\r\nbefore, and told her that she was feeling well, and asked about me. She\r\nwas under my treatment years ago.\r\n\r\nSupplementary facts: I once actually wrote something like a monograph on\r\na plant, namely, an essay on the coca plant, which drew the attention of\r\nK. Koller to the an\xc3\xa6sthetic properties of cocaine. I had hinted at this\r\nuse of the alkaloid in my publication, but I was not sufficiently\r\nthorough to pursue the matter further. This suggests that on the\r\nforenoon of the day after the dream (for the interpretation of which I\r\ndid not find time until the evening) I had thought of cocaine in a kind\r\nof day phantasy. In case I should ever be afflicted with glaucoma, I was\r\ngoing to go to Berlin, and there have myself operated upon, incognito,\r\nat the house of my Berlin friend, by a physician whom he would recommend\r\nto me. The surgeon, who would not know upon whom he was operating, would\r\nboast as usual how easy these operations had become since the\r\nintroduction of cocaine; I would not betray by a single sign that I had\r\nhad a share in making this discovery. With this phantasy were connected\r\nthoughts of how difficult it really is for a doctor to claim the medical\r\nservices of a colleague for his own person. I should be able to pay the\r\nBerlin eye specialist, who did not know me, like anyone else. Only after\r\nrecalling this day-dream do I realise that the recollection of a\r\ndefinite experience is concealed behind it. Shortly after Koller\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndiscovery my father had, in fact, become ill with glaucoma; he was\r\noperated upon by my friend, the eye specialist, Dr. Koenigstein. Dr.\r\nKoller attended to the cocaine an\xc3\xa6sthetisation, and thereupon made the\r\nremark that all three of the persons who had shared in the introduction\r\nof cocaine had been brought together on one case.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to think of the time when I was last reminded of this\r\naffair about the cocaine. This was a few days before, when I received a\r\n_Festschrift_, with whose publication grateful scholars had commemorated\r\nthe anniversary of their teacher and laboratory director. Among the\r\nhonours ascribed to persons connected with the laboratory, I found a\r\nnotice to the effect that the discovery of the an\xc3\xa6sthetic properties of\r\ncocaine had been made there by K. Koller. Now I suddenly become aware\r\nthat the dream is connected with an experience of the previous evening.\r\nI had just accompanied Dr. Koenigstein to his home, and had spoken to\r\nhim about a matter which strongly arouses my interest whenever it is\r\nmentioned. While I was talking with him in the vestibule, Professor\r\nG\xc3\xa4rtner and his young wife came up. I could not refrain from\r\ncongratulating them both upon their healthy appearance. Now Professor\r\nG\xc3\xa4rtner is one of the authors of the _Festschrift_ of which I have just\r\nspoken, and may well have recalled it to me. Likewise Mrs. L., whose\r\nbirthday disappointment I have referred to, had been mentioned, in\r\nanother connection, to be sure, in the conversation with Dr.\r\nKoenigstein.\r\n\r\nI shall now try to explain the other determinations of the dream\r\ncontent. _A dried specimen_ of the plant accompanies the monograph as\r\nthough it were a _herbarium_. A recollection of the _gymnasium_ (school)\r\nis connected with the herbarium. The director of our _gymnasium_ once\r\ncalled the scholars of the higher classes together in order to have them\r\ninspect and clean the herbarium. Small worms had been found\xe2\x80\x94bookworms.\r\nThe director did not seem to have much confidence in my help, for he\r\nleft only a few leaves for me. I know to this day that there were\r\ncrucifers on them. My interest in botany was never very great. At my\r\npreliminary examination in botany, I was required to identify a\r\ncrucifer, and did not recognise it. I would have fared badly if my\r\ntheoretical knowledge had not helped me out. Crucifers suggest\r\ncomposites. The artichoke is really a composite, and the one which I\r\nmight call my favourite flower. My wife, who is more thoughtful than I,\r\noften brings this favourite flower of mine home from the market.\r\n\r\nI see the monograph which I have written lying before me. This, too, is\r\nnot without its reference. The friend whom I pictured wrote to me\r\nyesterday from Berlin: \xe2\x80\x9cI think a great deal about your dream book. _I\r\nsee it lying before me finished, and am turning over its leaves._\xe2\x80\x9d How I\r\nenvied him this prophetic power! If I could only see it lying already\r\nfinished before me!\r\n\r\n_The folded Coloured Plate._\xe2\x80\x94While I was a student of medicine, I\r\nsuffered much from a fondness for studying in _monographs_ exclusively.\r\nIn spite of my limited means, I subscribed to a number of the medical\r\narchives, in which the coloured plates gave me much delight. I was proud\r\nof this inclination for thoroughness. So, when I began to publish on my\r\nown account, I had to draw the plates for my own treatises, and I\r\nremember one of them turned out so badly that a kindly-disposed\r\ncolleague ridiculed me for it. This suggests, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly how,\r\na very early memory from my youth. My father once thought it would be a\r\njoke to hand over a book with _coloured plates_ (_Description of a\r\nJourney in Persia_) to me and my eldest sister for destruction. This was\r\nhardly to be justified from an educational point of view. I was at the\r\ntime five years old, and my sister three, and the picture of our\r\nblissfully tearing this book to pieces (like an artichoke, I must add,\r\nleaf by leaf) is almost the only one from this time of life which has\r\nremained fresh in my memory. When I afterwards became a student, I\r\ndeveloped a distinct fondness for collecting and possessing books (an\r\nanalogy to the inclination for studying from monographs, a hobby which\r\noccurs in the dream thoughts with reference to cyclamen and artichoke).\r\nI became a book-worm (_cf._ herbarium). I have always referred this\r\nfirst passion of my life\xe2\x80\x94since I am engaging in retrospect\xe2\x80\x94to this\r\nchildhood impression, or rather I have recognised in this childish scene\r\na \xe2\x80\x9cconcealing recollection\xe2\x80\x9d for my subsequent love of books.[AR] Of\r\ncourse I also learned at an early age that our passions are often our\r\nsorrows. When I was seventeen years old I had a very respectable bill at\r\nthe book store, and no means with which to pay it, and my father would\r\nhardly accept the excuse that my inclination had not been fixed on\r\nsomething worse. But the mention of this later youthful experience\r\nimmediately brings me back to my conversation that evening with my\r\nfriend Dr. Koenigstein. For the talk on the evening of the dream-day\r\nbrought up the same old reproach that I am too fond of my hobbies.\r\n\r\nFor reasons which do not belong here, I shall not continue the\r\ninterpretation of this dream, but shall simply indicate the path which\r\nleads to it. In the course of the interpretation, I was reminded of my\r\nconversation with Dr. Koenigstein, and indeed of more than one portion\r\nof it. If I consider the subjects touched upon in this conversation, the\r\nmeaning of the dream becomes clear to me. All the thought associations\r\nwhich have been started, about the hobbies of my wife and of myself,\r\nabout the cocaine, about the difficulty of securing medical treatment\r\nfrom one\xe2\x80\x99s colleagues, my preference for monographic studies, and my\r\nneglect of certain subjects such as botany\xe2\x80\x94all this continues and\r\nconnects with some branch of this widely ramified conversation. The\r\ndream again takes on the character of a justification, of a pleading for\r\nmy rights, like the first analysed dream of Irma\xe2\x80\x99s injection; it even\r\ncontinues the theme which that dream started, and discusses it with the\r\nnew subject matter which has accrued in the interval between the two\r\ndreams. Even the apparently indifferent manner of expression of the\r\ndream receives new importance. The meaning is now: \xe2\x80\x9cI am indeed the man\r\nwho has written that valuable and successful treatise (on cocaine),\xe2\x80\x9d\r\njust as at that time I asserted for my justification: \xe2\x80\x9cI am a thorough\r\nand industrious student;\xe2\x80\x9d in both cases, then: \xe2\x80\x9cI can afford to do\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d But I may dispense with the further interpretation of the dream,\r\nbecause my only purpose in reporting it was to examine the relation of\r\nthe dream content to the experience of the previous day which arouses\r\nit. As long as I know only the manifest content of this dream, but one\r\nrelation to a day impression becomes obvious; after I have made the\r\ninterpretation, a second source of the dream becomes evident in another\r\nexperience of the same day. The first of these impressions to which the\r\ndream refers is an indifferent one, a subordinate circumstance. I see a\r\nbook in a shop window whose title holds me for a moment, and whose\r\ncontents could hardly interest me. The second experience has great\r\npsychic value; I have talked earnestly with my friend, the eye\r\nspecialist, for about an hour, I have made allusions in this\r\nconversation which must have touched both of us closely, and which\r\nawakened memories revealing the most diverse feelings of my inner self.\r\nFurthermore, this conversation was broken off unfinished because some\r\nfriends joined us. What, now, is the relation of these two impressions\r\nof the day to each other and to the dream which followed during the next\r\nnight?\r\n\r\nI find in the manifest content merely an allusion to the indifferent\r\nimpression, and may thus reaffirm that the dream preferably takes up\r\ninto its content non-essential experiences. In the dream interpretation,\r\non the contrary, everything converges upon an important event which is\r\njustified in demanding attention. If I judge the dream in the only\r\ncorrect way, according to the latent content which is brought to light\r\nin the analysis, I have unawares come upon a new and important fact. I\r\nsee the notion that the dream deals only with the worthless fragments of\r\ndaily experience shattered; I am compelled also to contradict the\r\nassertion that our waking psychic life is not continued in the dream,\r\nand that the dream instead wastes psychic activity upon a trifling\r\nsubject matter. The opposite is true; what has occupied our minds during\r\nthe day also dominates our dream thoughts, and we take pains to dream\r\nonly of such matters as have given us food for thought during the day.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most obvious explanation for the fact that I dream about\r\nsome indifferent impression of the day, while the impression which is\r\njustifiably stirring furnishes the occasion for dreaming, is that this\r\nagain is a phenomenon of the dream-disfigurement, which we have above\r\ntraced to a psychic power acting as a censor. The recollection of the\r\nmonograph on the genus cyclamen is employed as though it were an\r\nallusion to the conversation with my friend, very much as mention of the\r\nfriend in the dream of the deferred supper is represented by the\r\nallusion \xe2\x80\x9csmoked salmon.\xe2\x80\x9d The only question is, by what intermediate\r\nsteps does the impression of the monograph come to assume the relation\r\nof an allusion to the conversation with the eye specialist, since such a\r\nrelation is not immediately evident. In the example of the deferred\r\nsupper, the relation is set forth at the outset; \xe2\x80\x9csmoked salmon,\xe2\x80\x9d as the\r\nfavourite dish of the friend, belongs at once to the series of\r\nassociations which the person of the friend would call up in the lady\r\nwho is dreaming. In our new example we have two separated impressions,\r\nwhich seem at first glance to have nothing in common except that they\r\noccur on the same day. The monograph catches my attention in the\r\nforenoon; I take part in the conversation in the evening. The answer\r\nsupplied by the analysis is as follows: Such relations between the two\r\nimpressions do not at first exist, but are established subsequently\r\nbetween the presentation content of the one impression and the\r\npresentation content of the other. I have recently emphasised the\r\ncomponents in this relation in the course of recording the analysis.\r\nWith the notion of the monograph on cyclamen I should probably associate\r\nthe idea that cyclamen is my wife\xe2\x80\x99s favourite flower only under some\r\noutside influence, and this is perhaps the further recollection of the\r\nbunch of flowers missed by Mrs. L. I do not believe that these\r\nunderlying thoughts would have been sufficient to call forth a dream.\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cThere needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave\r\n          To tell us this,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nas we read in _Hamlet_. But behold! I am reminded in the analysis that\r\nthe name of the man who interrupted our conversation was G\xc3\xa4rtner\r\n(Gardener), and that I found his wife in blooming health;[AS] I even\r\nremember now that one of my female patients, who bears the pretty name\r\nof Flora, was for a time the main subject of our conversation. It must\r\nhave happened that I completed the connection between the two events of\r\nthe day, the indifferent and the exciting one, by means of these links\r\nfrom the series of associations belonging to the idea of botany. Other\r\nrelations are then established, that of cocaine, which can with perfect\r\ncorrectness form a go-between connecting the person of Dr. Koenigstein\r\nwith the botanical monograph which I have written, and strengthen the\r\nfusion of the two series of associations into one, so that now a portion\r\nof the first experience may be used as an allusion to the second.\r\n\r\nI am prepared to find this explanation attacked as arbitrary or\r\nartificial. What would have happened if Professor G\xc3\xa4rtner and his\r\nblooming wife had not come up, and if the patient who was talked about\r\nhad been called, not Flora, but Anna? The answer is easy, however. If\r\nthese thought-relations had not been present, others would probably have\r\nbeen selected. It is so easy to establish relations of this sort, as the\r\njoking questions and conundrums with which we amuse ourselves daily\r\nsuffice to show. The range of wit is unlimited. To go a step further: if\r\nit had been impossible to establish interrelations of sufficient\r\nabundance between the two impressions of the day, the dream would simply\r\nhave resulted differently; another of the indifferent impressions of the\r\nday, such as come to us in multitudes and are forgotten, would have\r\ntaken the place of the monograph in the dream, would have secured a\r\nconnection with the content of the talk, and would have represented it\r\nin the dream. Since it was the impression of the monograph and no other\r\nthat had this fate, this impression was probably the most suitable for\r\nthe establishment of the connection. One need not be astonished, like\r\nLessing\xe2\x80\x99s H\xc3\xa4nschen Schlau, because \xe2\x80\x9cit is the rich people of the world\r\nwho possess the most money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill the psychological process by which, according to our conception,\r\nthe indifferent experience is substituted for the psychologically\r\nimportant one, seems odd to us and open to question. In a later chapter\r\nwe shall undertake the task of making this seemingly incorrect operation\r\nmore intelligible. We are here concerned only with consequences of this\r\nprocedure, whose assumption we have been forced to make by the regularly\r\nrecurring experiences of dream analysis. But the process seems to be\r\nthat, in the course of those intermediate steps, a displacement\xe2\x80\x94let us\r\nsay of the psychic accent\xe2\x80\x94has taken place, until ideas that are at first\r\nweakly charged with intensity, by taking over the charge from ideas\r\nwhich have a stronger initial intensity, reach a degree of strength,\r\nwhich enables them to force their way into consciousness. Such\r\ndisplacements do not at all surprise us when it is a question of the\r\nbestowal of affects or of the motor actions in general. The fact that\r\nthe woman who has remained single transfers her affection to animals,\r\nthat the bachelor becomes a passionate collector, that the soldier\r\ndefends a scrap of coloured cloth, his flag, with his life-blood, that\r\nin a love affair a momentary clasping of hands brings bliss, or that in\r\n_Othello_ a lost handkerchief causes a burst of rage\xe2\x80\x94all these are\r\nexamples of psychic displacement which seem unquestionable to us. But\r\nif, in the same manner and according to the same fundamental principles,\r\na decision is made as to what is to reach our consciousness and what is\r\nto be withheld from it, that is to say, what we are to think\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nproduces an impression of morbidity, and we call it an error of thought\r\nif it occurs in waking life. We may here anticipate the result of a\r\ndiscussion which will be undertaken later\xe2\x80\x94namely, to the effect that the\r\npsychic process which we have recognised as dream displacement proves to\r\nbe not a process morbidly disturbed, but a process differing from the\r\nnormal merely in being of a more primitive nature.\r\n\r\nWe thus find in the fact that the dream content takes up remnants of\r\ntrivial experiences a manifestation of dream disfigurement (by means of\r\ndisplacement), and we may recall that we have recognised this dream\r\ndisfigurement as the work of a censor which controls the passage between\r\ntwo psychic instances. We accordingly expect that dream analysis will\r\nregularly reveal to us the genuine, significant source of the dream in\r\nthe life of the day, the recollection of which has transferred its\r\naccent to some indifferent recollection. This conception brings us into\r\ncomplete opposition to Robert\xe2\x80\x99s[55] theory, which thus becomes valueless\r\nfor us. The fact which Robert was trying to explain simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexist; its assumption is based upon a misunderstanding, upon the failure\r\nto substitute the real meaning of the dream for its apparent content.\r\nFurther objection may be made to Robert\xe2\x80\x99s doctrine: If it were really\r\nthe duty of the dream, by means of a special psychic activity, to rid\r\nour memory of the \xe2\x80\x9cslag\xe2\x80\x9d of the recollections of the day, our sleep\r\nwould have to be more troubled and employed in a more strained effort\r\nthan we may suppose it to be from our waking life. For the number of\r\nindifferent impressions received during the day, against which we should\r\nhave to protect our memory, is obviously infinitely large; the night\r\nwould not be long enough to accomplish the task. It is very much more\r\nprobable that the forgetting of indifferent impressions takes place\r\nwithout any active interference on the part of our psychic powers.\r\n\r\nStill something cautions us against taking leave of Robert\xe2\x80\x99s idea\r\nwithout further consideration. We have left unexplained the fact that\r\none of the indifferent day-impressions\xe2\x80\x94one from the previous day\r\nindeed\xe2\x80\x94regularly furnished a contribution to the dream-content.\r\nRelations between this impression and the real source of the dream do\r\nnot always exist from the beginning; as we have seen, they are\r\nestablished only subsequently, in the course of the dream-work, as\r\nthough in order to serve the purpose of the intended displacement. There\r\nmust, therefore, be some necessity to form connections in this\r\nparticular direction, of the recent, although indifferent impression;\r\nthe latter must have special fitness for this purpose because of some\r\nproperty. Otherwise it would be just as easy for the dream thoughts to\r\ntransfer their accent to some inessential member of their own series of\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\nThe following experiences will lead us to an explanation. If a day has\r\nbrought two or more experiences which are fitted to stimulate a dream,\r\nthen the dream fuses the mention of both into a single whole; it obeys\r\nan _impulse to fashion a whole out of them_; for instance: One summer\r\nafternoon I entered a railroad compartment, in which I met two friends\r\nwho were unknown to each other. One of them was an influential\r\ncolleague, the other a member of a distinguished family, whose physician\r\nI was; I made the two gentlemen acquainted with each other; but during\r\nthe long ride I was the go-between in the conversation, so that I had to\r\ntreat a subject of conversation now with the one, now with the other. I\r\nasked my colleague to recommend a common friend who had just begun his\r\nmedical practice. He answered that he was convinced of the young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthoroughness, but that his plain appearance would make his entrance into\r\nhouseholds of rank difficult. I answered: \xe2\x80\x9cThat is just why he needs\r\nrecommendation.\xe2\x80\x9d Soon afterwards I asked the other fellow-traveller\r\nabout the health of his aunt\xe2\x80\x94the mother of one of my patients\xe2\x80\x94who was at\r\nthe time prostrated by a serious illness. During the night after this\r\njourney I dreamt that the young friend, for whom I had asked assistance,\r\nwas in a splendid salon, and was making a funeral oration to a select\r\ncompany with the air of a man of the world\xe2\x80\x94the oration being upon the\r\nold lady (now dead for the purposes of the dream) who was the aunt of\r\nthe second fellow-traveller. (I confess frankly that I had not been on\r\ngood terms with this lady.) My dream had thus found connections between\r\nthe two impressions of the day, and by means of them composed a unified\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nIn view of many similar experiences, I am driven to conclude that a kind\r\nof compulsion exists for the dream function, forcing it to bring\r\ntogether in the dream all the available sources of dream stimulation\r\ninto a unified whole.[AT] In a subsequent chapter (on the dream\r\nfunction) we shall become acquainted with this impulse for putting\r\ntogether as a part of condensation another primary psychic process.\r\n\r\nI shall now discuss the question whether the source from which the dream\r\noriginates, and to which our analysis leads, must always be a recent\r\n(and significant) event, or whether a subjective experience, that is to\r\nsay, the recollection of a psychologically valuable experience\xe2\x80\x94a chain\r\nof thought\xe2\x80\x94can take the part of a dream stimulus. The answer, which\r\nresults most unequivocally from numerous analyses, is to the following\r\neffect. The stimulus for the dream may be a subjective occurrence, which\r\nhas been made recent, as it were, by the mental activity during the day.\r\nIt will probably not be out of place here to give a synopsis of various\r\nconditions which may be recognised as sources of dreams.\r\n\r\nThe source of a dream may be:\r\n\r\n(_a_) A recent and psychologically significant experience which is\r\ndirectly represented in the dream.[AU]\r\n\r\n(_b_) Several recent, significant experiences, which are united by the\r\ndream into a whole.[AV]\r\n\r\n(_c_) One or more recent and significant experiences, which are\r\nrepresented in the dream by the mention of a contemporary but\r\nindifferent experience.[AW]\r\n\r\n(_d_) A subjective significant experience (a recollection, train of\r\nthought), which is _regularly_ represented in the dream by the mention\r\nof a recent but indifferent impression.[AX]\r\n\r\nAs may be seen, in dream interpretation the condition is firmly adhered\r\nto throughout that each component of the dream repeats a recent\r\nimpression of the day. The element which is destined to representation\r\nin the dream may either belong to the presentations surrounding the\r\nactual dream stimulus itself\xe2\x80\x94and, furthermore, either as an essential or\r\nan inessential element of the same\xe2\x80\x94or it may originate in the\r\nneighbourhood of an indifferent impression, which, through associations\r\nmore or less rich, has been brought into relation with the thoughts\r\nsurrounding the dream stimulus. The apparent multiplicity of the\r\nconditions here is produced by _the alternative according to whether\r\ndisplacement has or has not taken place_, and we may note that this\r\nalternative serves to explain the contrasts of the dream just as readily\r\nas the ascending series from partially awake to fully awake brain cells\r\nin the medical theory of the dream (_cf._ p. 64).\r\n\r\nConcerning this series, it is further notable that the element which is\r\npsychologically valuable, but not recent (a train of thought, a\r\nrecollection) may be replaced, for the purposes of dream formation, by a\r\nrecent, but psychologically indifferent, element, if only these two\r\nconditions be observed: 1. That the dream shall contain a reference to\r\nsomething which has been recently experienced; 2. That the dream\r\nstimulus shall remain a psychologically valuable train of thought. In a\r\nsingle case (_a_) both conditions are fulfilled by the same impression.\r\nIf it be added that the same indifferent impressions which are used for\r\nthe dream, as long as they are recent, lose this availability as soon as\r\nthey become a day (or at most several days) older, the assumption must\r\nbe made that the very freshness of an impression gives it a certain\r\npsychological value for dream formation, which is somewhat equivalent to\r\nthe value of emotionally accentuated memories or trains of thought. We\r\nshall be able to see the basis of this value of _recent_ impressions for\r\ndream formation only with the help of certain psychological\r\nconsiderations which will appear later.[AY]\r\n\r\nIncidentally our attention is called to the fact that important changes\r\nin the material comprised by our ideas and our memory may be brought\r\nabout unconsciously and at night. The injunction that one should sleep\r\nfor a night upon any affair before making a final decision about it is\r\nobviously fully justified. But we see that at this point we have\r\nproceeded from the psychology of dreaming to that of sleep, a step for\r\nwhich there will often be occasion.\r\n\r\nNow there arises an objection threatening to invalidate the conclusions\r\nwe have just reached. If indifferent impressions can get into the dream\r\nonly in case they are recent, how does it happen that we find also in\r\nthe dream content elements from earlier periods in our lives, which at\r\nthe time when they were recent possessed, as Str\xc3\xbcmpell expresses it, no\r\npsychic value, which, therefore, ought to have been forgotten long ago,\r\nand which, therefore, are neither fresh nor psychologically significant?\r\n\r\nThis objection can be fully met if we rely upon the results furnished by\r\npsychoanalysis of neurotics. The solution is as follows: The process of\r\ndisplacement which substitutes indifferent material for that having\r\npsychic significance (for dreaming as well as for thinking) has already\r\ntaken place in those earlier periods of life, and has since become fixed\r\nin the memory. Those elements which were originally indifferent are in\r\nfact no longer so, since they have acquired the value of psychologically\r\nsignificant material. That which has actually remained indifferent can\r\nnever be reproduced in the dream.\r\n\r\nIt will be correct to suppose from the foregoing discussion that I\r\nmaintain that there are no indifferent dream stimuli, and that,\r\naccordingly, there are no harmless dreams. This I believe to be the\r\ncase, thoroughly and exclusively, allowance being made for the dreams of\r\nchildren and perhaps for short dream reactions to nocturnal sensations.\r\nWhatever one may dream, it is either manifestly recognisable as\r\npsychically significant or it is disfigured, and can be judged correctly\r\nonly after a complete interpretation, when, as before, it may be\r\nrecognised as possessing psychic significance. The dream never concerns\r\nitself with trifles; we do not allow ourselves to be disturbed in our\r\nsleep by matters of slight importance. Dreams which are apparently\r\nharmless turn out to be sinister if one takes pains to interpret them;\r\nif I may be permitted the expression, they all have \xe2\x80\x9cthe mark of the\r\nbeast.\xe2\x80\x9d As this is another point on which I may expect opposition, and\r\nas I am glad of an opportunity to show dream-disfigurement at work, I\r\nshall here subject a number of dreams from my collection to analysis.\r\n\r\n1. An intelligent and refined young lady, who, however, in conduct,\r\nbelongs to the class we call reserved, to the \xe2\x80\x9cstill waters,\xe2\x80\x9d relates\r\nthe following dream:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n_Her husband asks: \xe2\x80\x9cShould not the piano be tuned?\xe2\x80\x9d She answers: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t pay; the hammers would have to be newly buffed too.\xe2\x80\x9d_ This repeats\r\nan actual event of the previous day. Her husband had asked such a\r\nquestion, and she had answered something similar. But what is the\r\nsignificance of her dreaming it? She tells of the piano, indeed, that it\r\nis a _disgusting old box_ which has a bad tone; it is one of the things\r\nwhich her husband had before they were married,[AZ] &c., but the key to\r\nthe true solution lies in the phrase: _It won\xe2\x80\x99t pay._ This originated in\r\na visit made the day before to a lady friend. Here she was asked to take\r\noff her coat, but she declined, saying, \xe2\x80\x9c_It won\xe2\x80\x99t pay._ I must go in a\r\nmoment.\xe2\x80\x9d At this point, I recall that during yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s analysis she\r\nsuddenly took hold of her coat, a button of which had opened. It is,\r\ntherefore, as if she had said, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t look in this direction; it\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t pay.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus \xe2\x80\x9c_box_\xe2\x80\x9d develops into \xe2\x80\x9c_chest_,\xe2\x80\x9d or breast-box\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cbust\xe2\x80\x9d), and the interpretation of the dream leads directly to a time\r\nin her bodily development when she was dissatisfied with her shape. It\r\nalso leads to earlier periods, if we take into consideration\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_disgusting_\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c_bad tone_,\xe2\x80\x9d and remember how often in allusions and\r\nin dreams the two small hemispheres of the feminine body take the\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x94as a substitute and as an antithesis\xe2\x80\x94of the large ones.\r\n\r\nII. I may interrupt this dream to insert a brief harmless dream of a\r\nyoung man. He dreamt that _he was putting on his winter overcoat again,\r\nwhich was terrible_. The occasion for this dream is apparently the cold\r\nweather, which has recently set in again. On more careful examination we\r\nnote that the two short portions of the dream do not fit together well,\r\nfor what is there \xe2\x80\x9cterrible\xe2\x80\x9d about wearing a heavy or thick coat in the\r\ncold? Unfortunately for the harmlessness of this dream, the first idea\r\neduced in analysis is the recollection that on the previous day a lady\r\nhad secretly admitted to him that her last child owed its existence to\r\nthe bursting of a condom. He now reconstructs his thoughts in accordance\r\nwith this suggestion: A thin condom is dangerous, a thick one is bad.\r\nThe condom is an \xe2\x80\x9covercoat\xe2\x80\x9d (_\xc3\x9cberzieher_), for it is put over\r\nsomething; _Ueberzieher_ is also the name given in German to a thin\r\novercoat. An experience like the one related by the lady would indeed be\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cterrible\xe2\x80\x9d for an unmarried man.\xe2\x80\x94We may now return to our other harmless\r\ndreamer.\r\n\r\nIII. _She puts a candle into a candlestick; but the candle is broken, so\r\nthat it does not stand straight. The girls at school say she is clumsy;\r\nthe young lady replies that it is not her fault._\r\n\r\nHere, too, there is an actual occasion for the dream; the day before she\r\nhad actually put a candle into a candlestick; but this one was not\r\nbroken. A transparent symbolism has been employed here. The candle is an\r\nobject which excites the feminine genitals; its being broken, so that it\r\ndoes not stand straight, signifies impotence on the man\xe2\x80\x99s part (\xe2\x80\x9cit is\r\nnot her fault\xe2\x80\x9d). But does this young woman, carefully brought up, and a\r\nstranger to all obscenity, know of this application of the candle? She\r\nhappens to be able to tell how she came by this information. While\r\nriding in a boat on the Rhine, another boat passes containing students\r\nwho are singing or rather yelling, with great delight: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the Queen\r\nof Sweden with closed shutters and the candles of Apollo....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe does not hear or understand the last word. Her husband is asked to\r\ngive her the required explanation. These verses are then replaced in the\r\ndream content by the harmless recollection of a command which she once\r\nexecuted clumsily at a girls\xe2\x80\x99 boarding school, this occurring by means\r\nof the common features _closed shutters_. The connection between the\r\ntheme of onanism and that of impotence is clear enough. \xe2\x80\x9cApollo\xe2\x80\x9d in the\r\nlatent dream content connects this dream with an earlier one in which\r\nthe virgin Pallas figured. All this is obviously not harmless.\r\n\r\nIV. Lest it may seem too easy a matter to draw conclusions from dreams\r\nconcerning the dreamer\xe2\x80\x99s real circumstances, I add another dream coming\r\nfrom the same person which likewise appears harmless. \xe2\x80\x9c_I dreamt of\r\ndoing something_,\xe2\x80\x9d she relates, \xe2\x80\x9c_which I actually did during the day,\r\nthat is to say, I filled a little trunk so full of hooks that I had\r\ndifficulty in closing it. My dream was just like the actual\r\noccurrence._\xe2\x80\x9d Here the person relating the dream herself attaches chief\r\nimportance to the correspondence between the dream and reality. All such\r\ncriticisms upon the dream and remarks about it, although they have\r\nsecured a place in waking thought, regularly belong to the latent dream\r\ncontent, as later examples will further demonstrate. We are told, then,\r\nthat what the dream relates has actually taken place during the day. It\r\nwould take us too far afield to tell how we reach the idea of using the\r\nEnglish language to help us in the interpretation of this dream. Suffice\r\nit to say that it is again a question of a little box (_cf._ p. 130, the\r\ndream of the dead child in the box) which has been filled so full that\r\nnothing more can go into it. Nothing in the least sinister this time.\r\n\r\nIn all these \xe2\x80\x9charmless\xe2\x80\x9d dreams the sexual factor as a motive for the\r\nexercise of the censor receives striking prominence. But this is a\r\nmatter of primary importance, which we must postpone.\r\n\r\n\r\n         (_b_) _Infantile Experiences as the Source of Dreams_\r\n\r\nAs the third of the peculiarities of the dream content, we have cited\r\nfrom all the authors (except Robert) the fact that impressions from the\r\nearliest times of our lives, which seem not to be at the disposal of the\r\nwaking memory, may appear in the dream. It is, of course, difficult to\r\njudge how often or how seldom this occurs, because the respective\r\nelements of the dream are not recognised according to their origin after\r\nwaking. The proof that we are dealing with childhood impressions must\r\nthus be reached objectively, and the conditions necessary for this\r\nhappen to coincide only in rare instances. The story is told by A.\r\nMaury,[48] as being particularly conclusive, of a man who decided to\r\nvisit his birthplace after twenty years\xe2\x80\x99 absence. During the night\r\nbefore his departure, he dreams that he is in an altogether strange\r\ndistrict, and that he there meets a strange man with whom he has a\r\nconversation. Having afterward returned to his home, he was able to\r\nconvince himself that this strange district really existed in the\r\nneighbourhood of his home town, and the strange man in the dream turned\r\nout to be a friend of his dead father who lived there. Doubtless, a\r\nconclusive proof that he had seen both the man and the district in his\r\nchildhood. The dream, moreover, is to be interpreted as a dream of\r\nimpatience, like that of the girl who carries her ticket for the concert\r\nof the evening in her pocket (p. 110), of the child whose father had\r\npromised him an excursion to the Hameau, and the like. The motives\r\nexplaining why just this impression of childhood is reproduced for the\r\ndreamer cannot, of course, be discovered without an analysis.\r\n\r\nOne of the attendants at my lectures, who boasted that his dreams were\r\nvery rarely subject to disfigurement, told me that he had sometime\r\nbefore in a dream seen _his former tutor in bed with his nurse_, who had\r\nbeen in the household until he was eleven years old. The location of\r\nthis scene does not occur to him in the dream. As he was much\r\ninterested, he told the dream to his elder brother, who laughingly\r\nconfirmed its reality. The brother said he remembered the affair very\r\nwell, for he was at the time six years old. The lovers were in the habit\r\nof making him, the elder boy, drunk with beer, whenever circumstances\r\nwere favourable for nocturnal relations. The smaller child, at that time\r\nthree years old\xe2\x80\x94our dreamer\xe2\x80\x94who slept in the same room as the nurse, was\r\nnot considered an obstacle.\r\n\r\nIn still another case it may be definitely ascertained, without the aid\r\nof dream interpretation, that the dream contains elements from\r\nchildhood; that is, if it be a so-called _perennial_ dream, which being\r\nfirst dreamt in childhood, later appears again and again after adult age\r\nhas been reached. I may add a few examples of this sort to those already\r\nfamiliar, although I have never made the acquaintance of such a\r\nperennial dream in my own case. A physician in the thirties tells me\r\nthat a yellow lion, about which he can give the most detailed\r\ninformation, has often appeared in his dream-life from the earliest\r\nperiod of his childhood to the present day. This lion, known to him from\r\nhis dreams, was one day discovered _in natura_ as a long-forgotten\r\nobject made of porcelain, and on that occasion the young man learned\r\nfrom his mother that this object had been his favourite toy in early\r\nchildhood, a fact which he himself could no longer remember.\r\n\r\nIf we now turn from the manifest dream content to the dream thoughts\r\nwhich are revealed only upon analysis, the co-operation of childhood\r\nexperiences may be found to exist even in dreams whose content would not\r\nhave led us to suspect anything of the sort. I owe a particularly\r\ndelightful and instructive example of such a dream to my honoured\r\ncolleague of the \xe2\x80\x9cyellow lion.\xe2\x80\x9d After reading Nansen\xe2\x80\x99s account of his\r\npolar expedition, he dreamt that he was giving the bold explorer\r\nelectrical treatment in an ice field for an isch\xc3\xa6mia of which the latter\r\ncomplained! In the analysis of this dream, he remembered a story of his\r\nchildhood, without which the dream remains entirely unintelligible. When\r\nhe was a child, three or four years old, he was listening attentively to\r\na conversation of older people about trips of exploration, and presently\r\nasked papa whether exploration was a severe illness. He had apparently\r\nconfused \xe2\x80\x9ctrips\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9crips,\xe2\x80\x9d and the ridicule of his brothers and\r\nsisters prevented his ever forgetting the humiliating experience.\r\n\r\nThe case is quite similar when, in the analysis of the dream of the\r\nmonograph on the genus cyclamen, I happen upon the recollection,\r\nretained from childhood, that my father allowed me to destroy a book\r\nembellished with coloured plates when I was a little boy five years old.\r\nIt will perhaps be doubted whether this recollection actually took part\r\nin the composition of the dream content, and it will be intimated that\r\nthe process of analysis has subsequently established the connection. But\r\nthe abundance and intricacy of the ties of association vouch for the\r\ntruth of my explanation: cyclamen\xe2\x80\x94favourite flower\xe2\x80\x94favourite\r\ndish\xe2\x80\x94artichoke; to pick to pieces like an artichoke, leaf by leaf (a\r\nphrase which at that time rang in our ears \xc3\xa0 propos of the dividing up\r\nof the Chinese Empire)\xe2\x80\x94herbarium-bookworm, whose favourite dish is\r\nbooks. I may state further that the final meaning of the dream, which I\r\nhave not given here, has the most intimate connection with the content\r\nof the childhood scene.\r\n\r\nIn another series of dreams we learn from analysis that the wish itself,\r\nwhich has given rise to the dream, and whose fulfilment the dream turns\r\nout to be, has originated in childhood\xe2\x80\x94until one is astonished to find\r\nthat the child with all its impulses lives on in the dream.\r\n\r\nI shall now continue the interpretation of a dream which has already\r\nproved instructive\xe2\x80\x94I refer to the dream in which friend R. is my uncle\r\n(p. 116). We have carried its interpretation far enough for the\r\nwish-motive, of being appointed professor, to assert itself tangibly;\r\nand we have explained the affection displayed in the dream for friend R.\r\nas a fiction of opposition and spite against the aspersion of the two\r\ncolleagues, who appear in the dream thoughts. The dream was my own; I\r\nmay, therefore, continue the analysis by stating that my feelings were\r\nnot quite satisfied by the solution reached. I know that my opinion of\r\nthese colleagues who are so badly treated in the dream thoughts would\r\nhave been expressed in quite different terms in waking life; the potency\r\nof the wish not to share their fate in the matter of appointment seemed\r\nto me too slight to account for the discrepancy between my estimate in\r\nthe dream and that of waking. If my desire to be addressed by a new\r\ntitle proves so strong it gives proof of a morbid ambition, which I did\r\nnot know to exist in me, and which I believe is far from my thoughts. I\r\ndo not know how others, who think they know me, would judge me, for\r\nperhaps I have really been ambitious; but if this be true, my ambition\r\nhas long since transferred itself to other objects than the title and\r\nrank of assistant-professor.\r\n\r\nWhence, then, the ambition which the dream has ascribed to me? Here I\r\nremember a story which I heard often in my childhood, that at my birth\r\nan old peasant\xe2\x80\x99s wife had prophesied to my happy mother (I was her\r\nfirst-born) that she had given to the world a great man. Such prophecies\r\nmust occur very frequently; there are so many mothers happy in\r\nexpectation, and so many old peasant wives whose influence on earth has\r\nwaned, and who have therefore turned their eyes towards the future. The\r\nprophetess was not likely to suffer for it either. Might my hunger for\r\ngreatness have originated from this source? But here I recollect an\r\nimpression from the later years of my childhood, which would serve still\r\nbetter as an explanation. It was of an evening at an inn on the\r\nPrater,[BA] where my parents were accustomed to take me when I was\r\neleven or twelve years old. We noticed a man who went from table to\r\ntable and improvised verses upon any subject that was given to him. I\r\nwas sent to bring the poet to our table and he showed himself thankful\r\nfor the message. Before asking for his subject he threw off a few rhymes\r\nabout me, and declared it probable, if he could trust his inspiration,\r\nthat I would one day become a \xe2\x80\x9cminister.\xe2\x80\x9d I can still distinctly\r\nremember the impression made by this second prophecy. It was at the time\r\nof the election for the municipal ministry; my father had recently\r\nbrought home pictures of those elected to the ministry\xe2\x80\x94Herbst, Giskra,\r\nUnger, Berger, and others\xe2\x80\x94and we had illuminated them in honour of these\r\ngentlemen. There were even some Jews among them; every industrious\r\nJewish schoolboy therefore had the making of a minister in him. Even the\r\nfact that until shortly before my enrolment in the University I wanted\r\nto study jurisprudence, and changed my plans only at the last moment,\r\nmust be connected with the impressions of that time. A minister\xe2\x80\x99s career\r\nis under no circumstances open to a medical man. And now for my dream! I\r\nbegin to see that it transplants me from the sombre present to the\r\nhopeful time of the municipal election, and fulfils my wish of that time\r\nto the fullest extent. In treating my two estimable and learned\r\ncolleagues so badly, because they are Jews, the one as a simpleton and\r\nthe other as a criminal\xe2\x80\x94in doing this I act as though I were the\r\nminister of education, I put myself in his place. What thorough revenge\r\nI take upon his Excellency! He refuses to appoint me professor\r\nextraordinarius, and in return I put myself in his place in the dream.\r\n\r\nAnother case establishes the fact that although the wish which actuates\r\nthe dream is a present one, it nevertheless draws great intensification\r\nfrom childhood memories. I refer to a series of dreams which are based\r\nupon the longing to go to Rome. I suppose I shall still have to satisfy\r\nthis longing by means of dreams for a long time to come, because, at the\r\ntime of year which is at my disposal for travelling, a stay at Rome is\r\nto be avoided on account of considerations of health.[BB] Thus I once\r\ndreamt of seeing the Tiber and the bridge of St. Angelo from the window\r\nof a railroad compartment; then the train starts, and it occurs to me\r\nthat I have never entered the city at all. The view which I saw in the\r\ndream was modelled after an engraving which I had noticed in passing the\r\nday before in the parlour of one of my patients. On another occasion\r\nsome one is leading me upon a hill and showing me Rome half enveloped in\r\nmist, and so far in the distance that I am astonished at the\r\ndistinctness of the view. The content of this dream is too rich to be\r\nfully reported here. The motive, \xe2\x80\x9cto see the promised land from afar,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nis easily recognisable in it. The city is L\xc3\xbcbeck, which I first saw in\r\nthe mist; the original of the hill is the Gleichenberg. In a third\r\ndream, I am at last in Rome, as the dream tells me. To my\r\ndisappointment, the scenery which I see is anything but urban. _A little\r\nriver with black water, on one side of which are black rocks, on the\r\nother large white flowers. I notice a certain Mr. Zucker_ (with whom I\r\nam superficially acquainted), _and make up my mind to ask him to show me\r\nthe way into the city._ It is apparent that I am trying in vain to see a\r\ncity in the dream which I have never seen in waking life. If I resolve\r\nthe landscape into its elements, the white flowers indicate Ravenna,\r\nwhich is known to me, and which, for a time at least, deprived Rome of\r\nits leading place as capital of Italy. In the swamps around Ravenna we\r\nhad seen the most beautiful water-lilies in the middle of black pools of\r\nwater; the dream makes them grow on meadows, like the narcissi of our\r\nown Aussee, because at Ravenna it was such tedious work to fetch them\r\nout of the water. The black rock, so close to the water, vividly recalls\r\nthe valley of the Tepl at Karlsbad. \xe2\x80\x9cKarlsbad\xe2\x80\x9d now enables me to account\r\nfor the peculiar circumstance that I ask Mr. Zucker the way. In the\r\nmaterial of which the dream is composed appear also two of those amusing\r\nJewish anecdotes, which conceal so much profound and often bitter\r\nworldly wisdom, and which we are so fond of quoting in our conversation\r\nand letters. One is the story of the \xe2\x80\x9cconstitution,\xe2\x80\x9d and tells how a\r\npoor Jew sneaks into the express train for Karlsbad without a ticket,\r\nhow he is caught and is treated more and more unkindly at each call for\r\ntickets by the conductor, and how he tells a friend, whom he meets at\r\none of the stations during his miserable journey, and who asks him where\r\nhe is travelling: \xe2\x80\x9cTo Karlsbad, if my constitution will stand it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAssociated with this in memory is another story about a Jew who is\r\nignorant of French, and who has express instructions to ask in Paris for\r\nthe way to the Rue Richelieu. Paris was for many years the object of my\r\nown longing, and I took the great satisfaction with which I first set\r\nfoot on the pavement in Paris as a warrant that I should also attain the\r\nfulfilment of other wishes. Asking for the way is again a direct\r\nallusion to Rome, for of course all roads lead to Rome. Moreover, the\r\nname Zucker (English, sugar) again points to _Karlsbad_, whither we send\r\nall persons afflicted with the _constitutional_ disease, diabetes\r\n(_Zuckerkrankheit_, sugar-disease). The occasion for this dream was the\r\nproposal of my Berlin friend that we should meet in Prague at Easter. A\r\nfurther allusion to sugar and diabetes was to be found in the matters\r\nwhich I had to talk over with him.\r\n\r\nA fourth dream, occurring shortly after the last one mentioned, brings\r\nme back to Rome. I see a street-corner before me and am astonished to\r\nsee so many German placards posted there. On the day before I had\r\nwritten my friend with prophetic vision that Prague would probably not\r\nbe a comfortable resort for German travellers. The dream, therefore,\r\nsimultaneously expressed the wish to meet him at Rome instead of at the\r\nBohemian city, and a desire, which probably originated during my student\r\ndays, that the German language might be accorded more tolerance in\r\nPrague. Besides I must have understood the Czech language in the first\r\nthree years of my childhood, because I was born in a small village of\r\nMoravia, inhabited by Slavs. A Czech nursery rhyme, which I heard in my\r\nseventeenth year, became, without effort on my part, so imprinted upon\r\nmy memory that I can repeat it to this day, although I have no idea of\r\nits meaning. There is then no lack in these dreams also of manifold\r\nrelations to impressions from the first years of my life.\r\n\r\nIt was during my last journey to Italy, which, among other places, took\r\nme past Lake Trasimenus, that I at last found what re-enforcement my\r\nlonging for the Eternal City had received from the impressions of my\r\nyouth; this was after I had seen the Tiber, and had turned back with\r\npainful emotions when I was within eighty kilometers of Rome. I was just\r\nbroaching the plan of travelling to Naples via Rome the next year, when\r\nthis sentence, which I must have read in one of our classical authors,\r\noccurred to me: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a question which of the two paced up and down in\r\nhis room the more impatiently after he had made the plan to go to\r\nRome\xe2\x80\x94Assistant-Headmaster Winckelman or the great general Hannibal.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nmyself had walked in Hannibal\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps; like him I was destined never\r\nto see Rome, and he too had gone to Campania after the whole world had\r\nexpected him in Rome. Hannibal, with whom I had reached this point of\r\nsimilarity, had been my favourite hero during my years at the Gymnasium;\r\nlike so many boys of my age, I bestowed my sympathies during the Punic\r\nwar, not on the Romans, but on the Carthaginians. Then, when I came\r\nfinally to understand the consequences of belonging to an alien race,\r\nand was forced by the anti-semitic sentiment among my class-mates to\r\nassume a definite attitude, the figure of the semitic commander assumed\r\nstill greater proportions in my eyes. Hannibal and Rome symbolised for\r\nme as a youth the antithesis between the tenaciousness of the Jews and\r\nthe organisation of the Catholic Church. The significance for our\r\nemotional life which the anti-semitic movement has since assumed helped\r\nto fix the thoughts and impressions of that earlier time. Thus the wish\r\nto get to Rome has become the cover and symbol in my dream-life for\r\nseveral warmly cherished wishes, for the realisation of which one might\r\nwork with the perseverance and single-mindedness of the Punic general,\r\nand whose fulfilment sometimes seems as little favoured by fortune as\r\nthe wish of Hannibal\xe2\x80\x99s life to enter Rome.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the first time I happen upon the youthful experience which,\r\neven to-day, still manifests its power in all these emotions and dreams.\r\nI may have been ten or twelve years old when my father began to take me\r\nwith him on his walks, and to reveal to me his views about the things of\r\nthis world in his conversation. In this way he once told me, in order to\r\nshow into how much better times I had been born than he, the following:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile I was a young man, I was walking one Saturday on a street in the\r\nvillage where you were born; I was handsomely dressed and wore a new fur\r\ncap. Along comes a Christian, who knocks my cap into the mud with one\r\nblow and shouts: \xe2\x80\x9cJew, get off the sidewalk.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did you do?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwent into the street and picked up the cap,\xe2\x80\x9d was the calm answer. That\r\ndid not seem heroic on the part of the big strong man, who was leading\r\nme, a little fellow, by the hand. I contrasted this situation, which did\r\nnot please me, with another more in harmony with my feelings\xe2\x80\x94the scene\r\nin which Hannibal\xe2\x80\x99s father, Hamilcar[BC] Barka made his boy swear at the\r\ndomestic altar to take vengeance on the Romans. Since that time Hannibal\r\nhas had a place in my phantasies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI think I can follow my enthusiasm for the Carthaginian general still\r\nfurther back into my childhood, so that possibly we have here the\r\ntransference of an already formed emotional relation to a new vehicle.\r\nOne of the first books which fell into my childish hands, after I\r\nlearned to read, was Thiers\xe2\x80\x99 _Konsulat und Kaiserreich_ (Consulship and\r\nEmpire); I remember I pasted on the flat backs of my wooden soldiers\r\nlittle labels with the names of the Imperial marshals, and that at that\r\ntime Mass\xc3\xa9na (as a Jew Menasse) was already my avowed favourite.\r\nNapoleon himself follows Hannibal in crossing the Alps. And perhaps the\r\ndevelopment of this martial ideal can be traced still further back into\r\nmy childhood, to the wish which the now friendly, now hostile,\r\nintercourse during my first three years with a boy a year older than\r\nmyself must have actuated in the weaker of the two playmates.\r\n\r\nThe deeper one goes in the analysis of dreams, the more often one is put\r\non the track of childish experiences which play the part of dream\r\nsources in the latent dream content.\r\n\r\nWe have learned (p. 16) that the dream very rarely reproduces\r\nexperiences in such a manner that they constitute the sole manifest\r\ndream content, unabridged and unchanged. Still some authentic examples\r\nshowing this process have been reported, and I can add some new ones\r\nwhich again refer to infantile scenes. In the case of one of my\r\npatients, a dream once gave a barely disfigured reproduction of a sexual\r\noccurrence, which was immediately recognised as an accurate\r\nrecollection. The memory of it indeed had never been lost in waking\r\nlife, but it had been greatly obscured, and its revivification was a\r\nresult of the preceding work of analysis. The dreamer had at the age of\r\ntwelve visited a bed-ridden schoolmate, who had exposed himself by a\r\nmovement in bed, probably only by chance. At the sight of the genitals,\r\nhe was seized by a kind of compulsion, exposed himself and took hold of\r\nthe member belonging to the other boy, who, however, looked at him with\r\nsurprise and indignation, whereupon he became embarrassed and let go. A\r\ndream repeated this scene twenty-three years later, with all the details\r\nof the emotions occurring in it, changing it, however, in this respect,\r\nthat the dreamer took the passive part instead of the active one, while\r\nthe person of the schoolmate was replaced by one belonging to the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, of course, a childhood scene is represented in the manifest\r\ndream content only by an allusion, and must be extricated from the dream\r\nby means of interpretation. The citation of examples of this kind cannot\r\nhave a very convincing effect, because every guarantee that they are\r\nexperiences of childhood is lacking; if they belong to an earlier time\r\nof life, they are no longer recognised by our memory. Justification for\r\nthe conclusion that such childish experiences generally exist in dreams\r\nis based upon a great number of factors which become apparent in\r\npsychoanalytical work, and which seem reliable enough when regarded as a\r\nwhole. But when, for the purposes of dream interpretation, such\r\nreferences of dreams to childish experiences are torn from their\r\ncontext, they will perhaps not make much impression, especially since I\r\nnever give all the material upon which the interpretation depends.\r\nHowever, I shall not let this prevent me from giving some examples.\r\n\r\nI. The following dream is from another female patient: _She is in a\r\nlarge room, in which there are all kinds of machines, perhaps, as she\r\nimagines, an orthop\xc3\xa6dic institute. She hears that I have no time, and\r\nthat she must take the treatment along with five others. But she\r\nresists, and is unwilling to lie down on the bed\xe2\x80\x94or whatever it is\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nis intended for her. She stands in a corner and waits for me to say \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis not true.\xe2\x80\x9d The others, meanwhile, laugh at her, saying it is all\r\nfoolishness on her part. At the same time it is as if she were called\r\nupon to make many small squares._\r\n\r\nThe first part of the content of this dream is an allusion to the\r\ntreatment and a transference on me. The second contains an allusion to a\r\nchildhood scene; the two portions are connected by the mention of the\r\nbed. The orthop\xc3\xa6dic institute refers to one of my talks in which I\r\ncompared the treatment as to its duration and nature with an orthop\xc3\xa6dic\r\ntreatment. At the beginning of the treatment I had to tell her that _for\r\nthe present_ I had little time for her, but that later on I would devote\r\na whole hour to her daily. This aroused in her the old sensitiveness,\r\nwhich is the chief characteristic of children who are to be hysterical.\r\nTheir desire for love is insatiable. My patient was the youngest of six\r\nbrothers and sisters (hence, \xe2\x80\x9c_with five others_\xe2\x80\x9d), and as such the\r\nfavourite of her father, but in spite of that she seems to have found\r\nthat her beloved father devoted too little time and attention to her.\r\nThe detail of her waiting for me to say \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not true,\xe2\x80\x9d has the\r\nfollowing explanation: A tailor\xe2\x80\x99s apprentice had brought her a dress,\r\nand she had given him the money for it. Then she asked her husband\r\nwhether she would have to pay the money again if the boy were to lose\r\nit. To tease her, her husband answered \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d (the teasing in the dream),\r\nand she asked again and again, and _waited for him to say_ \xe2\x80\x9c_It is not\r\ntrue._\xe2\x80\x9d The thought of the latent dream-content may now be construed as\r\nfollows: Will she have to pay me the double amount if I devote twice the\r\ntime to her? a thought which is stingy or filthy. (The uncleanliness of\r\nchildhood is often replaced in the dream by greediness for money; the\r\nword filthy here supplies the bridge.) If all that about waiting until I\r\nshould say, &c., serves as a dream circumlocution for the word \xe2\x80\x9cfilthy,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe standing-in-a-corner and not lying down-on-the-bed are in keeping;\r\nfor these two features are component parts of a scene of childhood, in\r\nwhich she had soiled her bed, and for punishment was put into a corner,\r\nwith the warning that papa would not love her any more, and her brothers\r\nand sisters laughed at her, &c. The little squares refer to her young\r\nniece, who has shown her the arithmetical trick of writing figures in\r\nnine squares, I believe it is, in such a way that upon being added\r\ntogether in any direction they make fifteen.\r\n\r\nII. Here is the dream of a man: _He sees two boys tussling with each\r\nother, and they are cooper\xe2\x80\x99s boys, as he concludes from the implements\r\nwhich are lying about; one of the boys has thrown the other down, the\r\nprostrate one wears ear-rings with blue stones. He hurries after the\r\nwrongdoer with lifted cane, in order to chastise him. The latter takes\r\nrefuge with a woman who is standing against a wooden fence, as though it\r\nwere his mother. She is the wife of a day labourer, and she turns her\r\nback to the man who is dreaming. At last she faces about and stares at\r\nhim with a horrible look, so that he runs away in fright; in her eyes\r\nthe red flesh of the lower lid seems to stand out._\r\n\r\nThe dream has made abundant use of trivial occurrences of the previous\r\nday. The day before he actually saw two boys on the street, one of whom\r\nthrew the other one down. When he hurried up to them in order to settle\r\nthe quarrel, both of them took flight. Coopers\xe2\x80\x99 boys: this is explained\r\nonly by a subsequent dream, in the analysis of which he used the\r\nexpression, \xe2\x80\x9c_To knock the bottom out of the barrel._\xe2\x80\x9d Ear-rings with\r\nblue stones, according to his observation, are chiefly worn by\r\nprostitutes. Furthermore, a familiar doggerel rhyme about two boys comes\r\nup: \xe2\x80\x9cThe other boy, his name was Mary\xe2\x80\x9d (that is, he was a girl). The\r\nwoman standing up: after the scene with the two boys, he took a walk on\r\nthe bank of the Danube, and took advantage of being alone to urinate\r\n_against a wooden fence_. A little later during his walk, a decently\r\ndressed elderly lady smiled at him very pleasantly, and wanted to hand\r\nhim her card with her address.\r\n\r\nSince in the dream the woman stood as he had while urinating, it is a\r\nquestion of a woman urinating, and this explains the \xe2\x80\x9chorrible look,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand the prominence of the red flesh, which can only refer to the\r\ngenitals which gap in squatting. He had seen genitals in his childhood,\r\nand they had appeared in later recollection as \xe2\x80\x9cproud flesh\xe2\x80\x9d and as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwound.\xe2\x80\x9d The dream unites two occasions upon which, as a young boy, the\r\ndreamer had had opportunity to see the genitals of little girls, in\r\nthrowing one down, and while another was urinating; and, as is shown by\r\nanother association, he had kept in memory a punishment or threat of his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s, called forth by the sexual curiosity which the boy manifested\r\non these occasions.\r\n\r\nIII. A great mass of childish memories, which have been hastily united\r\nin a phantasy, is to be found behind the following dream of a young\r\nlady.\r\n\r\n_She goes out in trepidation, in order to do some shopping. On the\r\nGraben[BD] she sinks to her knees as though broken down. Many people\r\ncollect around her, especially the hackney-coach drivers; but no one\r\nhelps her to get up. She makes many unavailing attempts; finally she\r\nmust have succeeded, for she is put into a hackney-coach which is to\r\ntake her home. A large, heavily laden basket (something like a\r\nmarket-basket) is thrown after her through the window._\r\n\r\nThis is the same woman who is always harassed in her dreams as she was\r\nharassed when a child. The first situation of the dream is apparently\r\ntaken from seeing a horse that had fallen, just as \xe2\x80\x9cbroken down\xe2\x80\x9d points\r\nto horse-racing. She was a rider in her early years, still earlier she\r\nwas probably also a horse. Her first childish memory of the\r\nseventeen-year-old son of the porter, who, being seized on the street by\r\nan epileptic fit, was brought home in a coach, is connected with the\r\nidea of falling down. Of this, of course, she has only heard, but the\r\nidea of epileptic fits and of falling down has obtained great power over\r\nher phantasies, and has later influenced the form of her own hysterical\r\nattacks. When a person of the female sex dreams of falling, this almost\r\nregularly has a sexual significance; she becomes a \xe2\x80\x9cfallen woman,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nfor the purpose of the dream under consideration this interpretation is\r\nprobably the least doubtful, for she falls on the Graben, the place in\r\nVienna which is known as the concourse of prostitutes. The market-basket\r\nadmits of more than one interpretation; in the sense of refusal (German,\r\n_Korb_ = basket\xe2\x80\x94snub, refusal), she remembers the many snubs which she\r\nfirst gave her suitors, and which she later, as she thinks, received\r\nherself. Here belongs also the detail that _no one will help her up_,\r\nwhich she herself interprets as being disdained. Furthermore, the\r\nmarket-basket recalls phantasies that have already appeared in the\r\ncourse of analysis, in which she imagines she has married far beneath\r\nher station, and now goes marketing herself. But lastly the\r\nmarket-basket might be interpreted as the mark of a servant. This\r\nsuggests further childhood memories\xe2\x80\x94of a cook who was sent away because\r\nshe stole; she, too, sank to her knees and begged for mercy. The dreamer\r\nwas at that time twelve years old. Then there is a recollection of a\r\nchamber-maid, who was dismissed because she had an affair with the\r\ncoachman of the household, who, incidentally, married her afterwards.\r\nThis recollection, therefore, gives us a clue to the coachman in the\r\ndream (who do not, in contrast with what is actually the case, take the\r\npart of the fallen woman). But there still remains to be explained the\r\nthrowing of the basket, and the throwing of it through the window. This\r\ntakes her to the transference of baggage on the railroad, to the\r\n_Fensterln_,[BE] in the country, and to minor impressions received at a\r\ncountry resort, of a gentleman throwing some blue plums to a lady\r\nthrough her window, and of the dreamer\xe2\x80\x99s little sister being frightened\r\nbecause a cretin who was passing looked in at the window. And now from\r\nbehind this there emerges an obscure recollection, from her tenth year,\r\nof a nurse who made love at the country resort with a servant of the\r\nhousehold, of which the child had opportunity to see something, and who\r\nwas \xe2\x80\x9cfired\xe2\x80\x9d (thrown out) (in the dream the opposite: \xe2\x80\x9cthrown into\xe2\x80\x9d), a\r\nstory which we had also approached by several other paths. The baggage,\r\nmoreover, or the trunk of a servant, is disparagingly referred to in\r\nVienna as \xe2\x80\x9cseven plums.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPack up your seven plums and get out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy collection, of course, contains an abundant supply of such patients\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndreams, whose analysis leads to childish impressions that are remembered\r\nobscurely or not at all, and that often date back to the first three\r\nyears of life. But it is a mistake to draw conclusions from them which\r\nare to apply to the dream in general; we are in every case dealing with\r\nneurotic, particularly with hysterical persons; and the part played by\r\nchildhood scenes in these dreams might be conditioned by the nature of\r\nthe neurosis, and not by that of the dream. However, I am struck quite\r\nas often in the course of interpreting my own dreams, which I do not do\r\non account of obvious symptoms of disease, by the fact that I\r\nunsuspectingly come upon a scene of childhood in the latent dream\r\ncontent, and that a whole series of dreams suddenly falls into line with\r\nconclusions drawn from childish experiences. I have already given\r\nexamples of this, and shall give still more upon various occasions.\r\nPerhaps I cannot close the whole chapter more fittingly than by citing\r\nseveral of my own dreams, in which recent happenings and long-forgotten\r\nexperiences of childhood appear together as sources of dreams.\r\n\r\nI. After I have been travelling and have gone to bed hungry and tired,\r\nthe great necessities of life begin to assert their claims in sleep, and\r\nI dream as follows: _I go into a kitchen to order some pastry. Here\r\nthree women are standing, one of whom is the hostess, and is turning\r\nsomething in her hand as though she were making dumplings. She answers\r\nthat I must wait until she has finished_ (not distinctly as a speech).\r\n_I become impatient and go away insulted. I put on an overcoat; but the\r\nfirst one which I try is too long. I take it off, and am somewhat\r\nastonished to find that it has fur trimming. A second one has sewn into\r\nit a long strip of cloth with Turkish drawings. A stranger with a long\r\nface and a short pointed beard comes up and prevents me from putting it\r\non, declaring that it belongs to him. I now show him that it is\r\nembroidered all over in Turkish fashion. He asks, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat business are the\r\nTurkish (drawings, strips of cloth ...) of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d But we then become\r\nquite friendly with each other._\r\n\r\nIn the analysis of this dream there occurs to me quite unexpectedly the\r\nnovel which I read, that is to say, which I began with the end of the\r\nfirst volume, when I was perhaps thirteen years old. I have never known\r\nthe name of the novel or of its author, but the conclusion remains\r\nvividly in my memory. The hero succumbs to insanity, and continually\r\ncalls the names of the three women that have signified the greatest good\r\nand ill fortune for him during life. P\xc3\xa9lagie is one of these names. I\r\nstill do not know what to make of this name in the analysis. \xc3\x80 propos of\r\nthe three women there now come to the surface the three Parc\xc3\xa6 who spin\r\nthe fate of man, and I know that one of the three women, the hostess in\r\nthe dream, is the mother who gives life, and who, moreover, as in my\r\ncase, gives the first nourishment to the living creature. Love and\r\nhunger meet at the mother\xe2\x80\x99s breast. A young man\xe2\x80\x94so runs an anecdote\xe2\x80\x94who\r\nbecame a great admirer of womanly beauty, once when the conversation\r\nturned upon a beautiful wet nurse who had nourished him as a child,\r\nexpressed himself to the effect that he was sorry that he had not taken\r\nbetter advantage of his opportunity at the time. I am in the habit of\r\nusing the anecdote to illustrate the factor of subsequence in the\r\nmechanism of psychoneuroses.... One of the Parc\xc3\xa6, then, is rubbing the\r\npalms of her hands together as though she were making dumplings. A\r\nstrange occupation for one of the Fates, which is urgently in need of an\r\nexplanation! This is now found in another and earlier childhood memory.\r\nWhen I was six years old, and was receiving my first instructions from\r\nmy mother, I was asked to believe that we are made of earth, and that\r\ntherefore we must return to earth. But this did not suit me, and I\r\ndoubted her teaching. Thereupon my mother rubbed the palms of her hands\r\ntogether\xe2\x80\x94just as in making dumplings, except that there was no dough\r\nbetween them\xe2\x80\x94and showed me the blackish scales of epidermis which were\r\nthus rubbed off as a proof that it is earth of which we are made. My\r\nastonishment at this demonstration _ad oculos_ was without limit, and I\r\nacquiesced in the idea which I was later to hear expressed in words:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou owest nature a death.\xe2\x80\x9d[BF] Thus the women are really Parc\xc3\xa6 whom I\r\nvisit in the kitchen, as I have done so often in my childhood years when\r\nI was hungry, and when my mother used to order me to wait until lunch\r\nwas ready. And now for the dumplings! At least one of my teachers at the\r\nUniversity, the very one to whom I am indebted for my histological\r\nknowledge (epidermis), might be reminded by the name Knoedl (German,\r\n_Knoedel_ = dumplings) of a person whom he had to prosecute for\r\ncommitting a plagiarism of his writings. To commit plagiarism, to\r\nappropriate anything one can get, even though it belongs to another,\r\nobviously leads to the second part of the dream, in which I am treated\r\nlike a certain overcoat thief, who for a time plied his trade in the\r\nauditoria. I wrote down the expression plagiarism\xe2\x80\x94without any\r\nreason\xe2\x80\x94because it presented itself to me, and now I perceive that it\r\nmust belong to the latent dream-content, because it will serve as a\r\nbridge between different parts of the manifest dream-content. The chain\r\nof associations\xe2\x80\x94P\xc3\xa9lagie\xe2\x80\x94plagiarism\xe2\x80\x94plagiostomi[BG] (sharks)\xe2\x80\x94fish\r\nbladder\xe2\x80\x94connects the old novel with the affair of Knoedl and with the\r\novercoats (German, _\xc3\x9cberzieher_ = thing drawn over\xe2\x80\x94overcoat or condom),\r\nwhich obviously refer to an object belonging to the technique of sexual\r\nlife.[BH] This, it is true, is a very forced and irrational connection,\r\nbut it is nevertheless one which I could not establish in waking life if\r\nit had not been already established by the activity of the dream.\r\nIndeed, as though nothing were sacred for this impulse to force\r\nconnections, the beloved name, Bruecke (bridge of words, see above), now\r\nserves to remind me of the institution in which I spent my happiest\r\nhours as a student, quite without any cares (\xe2\x80\x9cSo you will ever find more\r\npleasure at the breasts of knowledge without measure\xe2\x80\x9d), in the most\r\ncomplete contrast to the urgent desires which vex me while I dream. And\r\nfinally there comes to the surface the recollection of another dear\r\nteacher, whose name again sounds like something to eat (Fleischl\xe2\x80\x94German,\r\n_Fleisch_ = meat\xe2\x80\x94like Knoedl), and of a pathetic scene, in which the\r\nscales of epidermis play a part (mother\xe2\x80\x94hostess), and insanity (the\r\nnovel), and a remedy from the Latin kitchen which numbs the sensation of\r\nhunger, to wit, cocaine.\r\n\r\nIn this manner I could follow the intricate trains of thought still\r\nfurther, and could fully explain the part of the dream which is missing\r\nin the analysis; but I must refrain, because the personal sacrifices\r\nwhich it would require are too great. I shall merely take up one of the\r\nthreads, which will serve to lead us directly to the dream thoughts that\r\nlie at the bottom of the confusion. The stranger, with the long face and\r\npointed beard, who wants to prevent me from putting on the overcoat, has\r\nthe features of a tradesman at Spalato, of whom my wife made ample\r\npurchases of Turkish cloths. His name was Popovic\xcc\x93, a suspicious name,\r\nwhich, by the way, has given the humorist Stettenheim a chance to make a\r\nsignificant remark: \xe2\x80\x9cHe told me his name, and blushingly shook my\r\nhand.\xe2\x80\x9d[BI] Moreover, there is the same abuse of names as above with\r\nP\xc3\xa9lagie, Knoedl, Bruecke, Fleischl. That such playing with names is\r\nchildish nonsense can be asserted without fear of contradiction; if I\r\nindulge in it, this indulgence amounts to an act of retribution, for my\r\nown name has numberless times fallen a victim to such weak-minded\r\nattempts at humour. Goethe once remarked how sensitive a man is about\r\nhis name with which, as with his skin, he feels that he has grown up,\r\nwhereupon Herder composed the following on his name:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x9cThou who art born of _gods_, of _Goths_, or of _Kot_ (mud)\xe2\x80\x94\r\n      Thy _god_like images, too, are dust.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI perceive that this digression about the abuse of names was only\r\nintended to prepare for this complaint. But let us stop here.... The\r\npurchase at Spalato reminds me of another one at Cattaro, where I was\r\ntoo cautious, and missed an opportunity for making some desirable\r\nacquisitions. (Missing an opportunity at the breast of the nurse, see\r\nabove.) Another dream thought, occasioned in the dreamer by the\r\nsensation of hunger, is as follows: _One should let nothing which one\r\ncan have escape, even if a little wrong is done; no opportunity should\r\nbe missed, life is so short, death inevitable._ Owing to the fact that\r\nthis also has a sexual significance, and that desire is unwilling to\r\nstop at a wrong, this philosophy of _carpe diem_ must fear the censor\r\nand must hide behind a dream. This now makes articulate counter-thoughts\r\nof all kinds, recollections of a time when spiritual food alone was\r\nsufficient for the dreamer; it suggests repressions of every kind, and\r\neven threats of disgusting sexual punishments.\r\n\r\nII. A second dream requires a longer preliminary statement:\r\n\r\nI have taken a car to the West Station in order to begin a vacation\r\njourney to the Aussee, and I reach the station in time for the train to\r\nIschl, which leaves earlier. Here I see Count Thun, who is again going\r\nto see the Emperor at Ischl. In spite of the rain, he has come in an\r\nopen carriage, has passed out at once through the door for local trains,\r\nand has motioned back the gate-keeper, who does not know him and who\r\nwants to take his ticket, with a little wave of his hand. After the\r\ntrain to Ischl has left, I am told to leave the platform and go back\r\ninto the hot waiting-room; but with difficulty I secure permission to\r\nremain. I pass the time in watching the people who make use of bribes to\r\nsecure a compartment; I make up my mind to insist on my rights\xe2\x80\x94that is,\r\nto demand the same privilege. Meanwhile I sing something to myself,\r\nwhich I afterwards recognise to be the aria from Figaro\xe2\x80\x99s Wedding:\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x9cIf my lord Count wishes to try a dance,\r\n                          Try a dance,\r\n                Let him but say so,\r\n                I\xe2\x80\x99ll play him a tune.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(Possibly another person would not have recognised the song.)\r\n\r\nDuring the whole afternoon I have been in an insolent, combative mood;\r\nI have spoken roughly to the waiter and the cabman, I hope without\r\nhurting their feelings; now all kinds of bold and revolutionary\r\nthoughts come into my head, of a kind suited to the words of Figaro\r\nand the comedy of Beaumarchais, which I had seen at the Com\xc3\xa9die\r\nFran\xc3\xa7aise. The speech about great men who had taken the trouble to be\r\nborn; the aristocratic prerogative, which Count Almaviva wants to\r\napply in the case of Susan; the jokes which our malicious journalists\r\nof the Opposition make upon the name of Count Thun (German, _thun_ =\r\ndoing) by calling him Count Do-Nothing. I really do not envy him; he\r\nhas now a difficult mission with the Emperor, and I am the real Count\r\nDo-Nothing, for I am taking a vacation. With this, all kinds of\r\ncheerful plans for the vacation. A gentleman now arrives who is known\r\nto me as a representative of the Government at the medical\r\nexaminations, and who has won the flattering nickname of \xe2\x80\x9cGovernmental\r\nbed-fellow\xe2\x80\x9d by his activities in this capacity. By insisting on his\r\nofficial station he secures half of a first-class compartment, and I\r\nhear one guard say to the other: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are we going to put the\r\ngentleman with the first-class half-compartment?\xe2\x80\x9d A pretty\r\nfavouritism; I am paying for a whole first-class compartment. Now I\r\nget a whole compartment for myself, but not in a through coach, so\r\nthat there is no toilet at my disposal during the night. My complaints\r\nto the guard are without result; I get even by proposing that at least\r\nthere be a hole made in the floor of this compartment for the possible\r\nneeds of the travellers. I really awake at a quarter of three in the\r\nmorning with a desire to urinate, having had the following dream:\r\n\r\nCrowd of people, meeting of students.... _A certain Count (Thun or\r\nTaafe) is making a speech. Upon being asked to say something about the\r\nGermans, he declares with contemptuous mien that their favourite flower\r\nis Colt\xe2\x80\x99s-foot, and then puts something like a torn leaf, really the\r\ncrumpled skeleton of a leaf, into his buttonhole. I make a start, I make\r\na start then,[BJ] but I am surprised at this idea of mine._ Then more\r\nindistinctly: _It seems as though it were the vestibule (Aula), the\r\nexits are jammed, as though it were necessary to flee. I make my way\r\nthrough a suite of handsomely furnished rooms, apparently governmental\r\nchambers, with furniture of a colour which is between brown and violet,\r\nand at last I come to a passage where a housekeeper, an elderly, fat\r\nwoman (Frauenzimmer), is seated. I try to avoid talking to her, but\r\napparently she thinks I have a right to pass because she asks whether\r\nshe shall accompany me with the lamp. I signify to her to tell her that\r\nshe is to remain standing on the stairs, and in this I appear to myself\r\nvery clever, for avoiding being watched at last. I am downstairs now,\r\nand I find a narrow, steep way along which I go._\r\n\r\nAgain indistinctly.... _It is as if my second task were to get away out\r\nof the city, as my earlier was to get out of the house. I am riding in a\r\none-horse carriage, and tell the driver to take me to a railway station.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot ride with you on the tracks,\xe2\x80\x9d I say, after he has made the\r\nobjection that I have tired him out. Here it seems as though I had\r\nalready driven with him along a course which is ordinarily traversed on\r\nthe railroad. The stations are crowded; I consider whether I shall go to\r\nKrems or to Znaim, but I think that the court will be there, and I\r\ndecide in favour of Graz or something of the sort. Now I am seated in\r\nthe coach, which is something like a street-car, and I have in my\r\nbuttonhole a long braided thing, on which are violet-brown violets of\r\nstiff material, which attracts the attention of many people. Here the\r\nscene breaks off._\r\n\r\n_I am again in front of the railroad station, but I am with a elderly\r\ngentleman. I invent a scheme for remaining unrecognised, but I also see\r\nthis plan already carried out. Thinking and experiencing are here, as it\r\nwere, the same thing. He pretends to be blind, at least in one eye, and\r\nI hold a male urinal in front of him (which we have had to buy in the\r\ncity or did buy), I am thus a sick attendant, and have to give him the\r\nurinal because he is blind. If the conductor sees us in this position,\r\nhe must pass us by without drawing attention. At the same time the\r\nattitude of the person mentioned is visually observed._ Then I awake\r\nwith a desire to urinate.\r\n\r\nThe whole dream seems a sort of phantasy, which takes the dreamer back\r\nto the revolutionary year 1848, the memory of which had been renewed by\r\nthe anniversary year 1898, as well as by a little excursion to Wachau,\r\nwhere I had become acquainted with Emmersdorf, a town which I wrongly\r\nsupposed to be the resting-place of the student leader Fischof, to whom\r\nseveral features of the dream content might refer. The thought\r\nassociations then lead me to England, to the house of my brother, who\r\nwas accustomed jokingly to tell his wife of \xe2\x80\x9cFifty years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d according\r\nto the title of a poem by Lord Tennyson, whereupon the children were in\r\nthe habit of correcting: \xe2\x80\x9cFifteen years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d This phantasy, however,\r\nwhich subtilely attaches itself to the thoughts which the sight of the\r\nCount Thun has given rise to, is only like the fa\xc3\xa7ade of Italian\r\nchurches which is superimposed without being organically connected with\r\nthe building behind it; unlike these fa\xc3\xa7ades, however, the phantasy is\r\nfilled with gaps and confused, and the parts from within break through\r\nat many places. The first situation of the dream is concocted from\r\nseveral scenes, into which I am able to separate it. The arrogant\r\nattitude of the Count in the dream is copied from a scene at the\r\nGymnasium which took place in my fifteenth year. We had contrived a\r\nconspiracy against an unpopular and ignorant teacher, the leading spirit\r\nin which was a schoolmate who seems to have taken Henry VIII. of England\r\nas his model. It fell to me to carry out the _coup-d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tat_, and a\r\ndiscussion of the importance of the Danube (German _Donau_) for Austria\r\n(Wachau!) was the occasion upon which matters came to open indignation.\r\nA fellow-conspirator was the only aristocratic schoolmate whom we had\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwas called the \xe2\x80\x9cgiraffe\xe2\x80\x9d on account of his conspicuous longitudinal\r\ndevelopment\xe2\x80\x94and he stood just like the Count in the dream, while he was\r\nbeing reprimanded by the tyrant of the school, the Professor of the\r\nGerman language. The explanation of the favourite flower and the putting\r\ninto the buttonhole of something which again must have been a flower\r\n(which recalls the orchids, which I had brought to a lady friend on the\r\nsame day, and besides that the rose of Jericho) prominently recalls the\r\nscene in Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s historical plays which opens the civil wars of\r\nthe Red and the White Roses; the mention of Henry VIII. has opened the\r\nway to this reminiscence. It is not very far now from roses to red and\r\nwhite carnations. Meanwhile two little rhymes, the one German, the other\r\nSpanish, insinuate themselves into the analysis: \xe2\x80\x9cRoses, tulips,\r\ncarnations, all flowers fade,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cIsabelita, no llores que se\r\nmarchitan las flores.\xe2\x80\x9d The Spanish is taken from _Figaro_. Here in\r\nVienna white carnations have become the insignia of the Anti-Semites,\r\nthe red ones of the Social Democrats. Behind this is the recollection of\r\nan anti-Semitic challenge during a railway trip in beautiful Saxony\r\n(Anglo-Saxon). The third scene contributing to the formation of the\r\nfirst situation in the dream takes place in my early student life. There\r\nwas a discussion in the German students\xe2\x80\x99 club about the relation of\r\nphilosophy to the general sciences. A green youth, full of the\r\nmaterialistic doctrine, I thrust myself forward and defended a very\r\none-sided view. Thereupon a sagacious older school-fellow, who has since\r\nshown his capacity for leading men and organising the masses, and who,\r\nmoreover, bears a name belonging to the animal kingdom, arose and called\r\nus down thoroughly; he too, he said, had herded swine in his youth, and\r\nhad come back repentant to the house of his father. I started up (as in\r\nthe dream), became very uncivil, and answered that since I knew he had\r\nherded swine, I was not surprised at the tone of his discourse. (In the\r\ndream I am surprised at my national German sentiment.) There was great\r\ncommotion; and the demand came from all sides that I take back what I\r\nhad said, but I remained steadfast. The man who had been insulted was\r\ntoo sensible to take the advice, which was given him, to send a\r\nchallenge, and let the matter drop.\r\n\r\nThe remaining elements of this scene of the dream are of more remote\r\norigin. What is the meaning of the Count\xe2\x80\x99s proclaiming the colt\xe2\x80\x99s foot?\r\nHere I must consult my train of associations. Colt\xe2\x80\x99s-foot (German:\r\n_Huflattich_)\xe2\x80\x94lattice\xe2\x80\x94lettuce\xe2\x80\x94salad-dog (the dog that grudges others\r\nwhat he cannot eat himself). Here plenty of opprobrious epithets may be\r\ndiscerned: Gir-affe (German _Affe_ = monkey, ape), pig, sow, dog; I\r\nmight even find means to arrive at donkey, on a detour by way of a name,\r\nand thus again at contempt for an academic teacher. Furthermore I\r\ntranslate colt\xe2\x80\x99s-foot (_Huflattich_)\xe2\x80\x94I do not know how correctly\xe2\x80\x94by\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpisse-en-lit.\xe2\x80\x9d I got this idea from Zola\xe2\x80\x99s _Germinal_, in which\r\nchildren are ordered to bring salad of this kind. The dog\xe2\x80\x94_chien_\xe2\x80\x94has a\r\nname sounding like the major function (_chier_, as _pisser_ stands for\r\nthe minor one). Now we shall soon have before us the indecent in all\r\nthree of its categories; for in the same _Germinal_, which has a lot to\r\ndo with the future revolution there is described a very peculiar\r\ncontest, depending upon the production of gaseous excretions, called\r\nflatus.[BK] And now I must remark how the way to this flatus has been\r\nfor a long while preparing, beginning with the flowers, and proceeding\r\nto the Spanish rhyme of Isabelita to Ferdinand and Isabella, and, by way\r\nof Henry VIII., to English history at the time of the expedition of the\r\nArmada against England, after the victorious termination of which the\r\nEnglish struck a medal with the inscription: \xe2\x80\x9c_Afflavit_ et dissipati\r\nsunt,\xe2\x80\x9d for the storm had scattered the Spanish fleet. I had thought of\r\ntaking this phrase for the title of a chapter on \xe2\x80\x9cTherapeutics\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to be\r\nmeant half jokingly\xe2\x80\x94if I should ever have occasion to give a detailed\r\naccount of my conception and treatment of hysteria.\r\n\r\nI cannot give such a detailed solution of the second scene of the dream,\r\nout of regard for the censor. For at this point I put myself in the\r\nplace of a certain eminent gentleman of that revolutionary period, who\r\nalso had an adventure with an eagle, who is said to have suffered from\r\nincontinence of the bowels, and the like; and I believe I _should not be\r\njustified at this point in passing_ the censor, although it was an aulic\r\ncouncillor (_aula_, _consilarius aulicus_) who told me the greater part\r\nof these stories. The allusion to the suite of rooms in the dream\r\nrelates to the private car of his Excellency, into which I had\r\nopportunity to look for a moment; but it signifies, as so often in\r\ndreams, a woman (Frauenzimmer; German _Zimmer_\xe2\x80\x94room is appended to\r\n_Frauen_\xe2\x80\x94woman, in order to imply a slight amount of contempt).[BL] In\r\nthe person of the housekeeper I give scant recognition to an intelligent\r\nelderly lady for the entertainment and the many good stories which I\r\nhave enjoyed at her house.... The feature of the lamp goes back to\r\nGrillparzer, who notes a charming experience of a similar nature, which\r\nhe afterwards made use of in \xe2\x80\x9cHero and Leander\xe2\x80\x9d (the billows of the\r\nocean and of love\xe2\x80\x94the Armada and the storm).[BM]\r\n\r\nI must also forgo detailed analysis of the two remaining portions of the\r\ndream; I shall select only those elements which lead to two childhood\r\nscenes, for the sake of which alone I have taken up the dream. The\r\nreader will guess that it is sexual matter which forces me to this\r\nsuppression; but he need not be content with this explanation. Many\r\nthings which must be treated as secrets in the presence of others are\r\nnot treated as such with one\xe2\x80\x99s self, and here it is not a question of\r\nconsiderations inducing me to hide the solution, but of motives of the\r\ninner censor concealing the real content of the dream from myself. I may\r\nsay, then, that the analysis shows these three portions of the dream to\r\nbe impertinent boasting, the exuberance of an absurd grandiose idea\r\nwhich has long since been suppressed in my waking life, which, however,\r\ndares show itself in the manifest dream content by one or two\r\nprojections (_I seem clever to myself_), and which makes the arrogant\r\nmood of the evening before the dream perfectly intelligible. It is\r\nboasting, indeed, in all departments; thus the mention of Graz refers to\r\nthe phrase: What is the price of Graz? which we are fond of using when\r\nwe feel over-supplied with money. Whoever will recall Master Rabelais\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunexcelled description of the \xe2\x80\x9cLife and Deeds of Gargantua and his Son\r\nPantagruel,\xe2\x80\x9d will be able to supply the boastful content intimated in\r\nthe first portion of the dream. The following belongs to the two\r\nchildhood scenes which have been promised. I had bought a new trunk for\r\nthis journey, whose colour, a brownish violet, appears in the dream\r\nseveral times. (Violet-brown violets made of stiff material, next to a\r\nthing which is called \xe2\x80\x9cgirl-catcher\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the furniture in the governmental\r\nchambers). That something new attracts people\xe2\x80\x99s attention is a\r\nwell-known belief of children. Now I have been told the following story\r\nof my childhood; I remember hearing the story rather than the occurrence\r\nitself. I am told that at the age of two I still occasionally wetted my\r\nbed, that I was often reproached on this subject, and that I consoled my\r\nfather by promising to buy him a beautiful new red bed in N. (the\r\nnearest large city). (Hence the detail inserted in the dream that _we\r\nbought the urinal in the city or had to buy it_; one must keep one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npromises. Attention is further called to the identity of the male urinal\r\nand the feminine trunk, box). All the megalomania of the child is\r\ncontained in this promise. The significance of the dream of difficulty\r\nin urinating in the case of the child has been already considered in the\r\ninterpretation of an earlier dream (_cf._ the dream on p. 145).\r\n\r\nNow there was another domestic occurrence, when I was seven or eight\r\nyears old, which I remember very well. One evening, before going to bed\r\nI had disregarded the dictates of discretion not to satisfy my wants in\r\nthe bedroom of my parents and in their presence, and in his reprimand\r\nfor this delinquency my father made the remark: \xe2\x80\x9cThat boy will never\r\namount to anything.\xe2\x80\x9d It must have terribly mortified my ambition, for\r\nallusions to this scene return again and again in my dreams, and are\r\nregularly coupled with enumerations of my accomplishments and successes,\r\nas though I wanted to say: \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I have amounted to something after\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d Now this childhood scene furnishes the elements for the last image\r\nof the dream, in which of course, the r\xc3\xb4les are interchanged for the\r\nsake of revenge. The elderly man, obviously my father, for the blindness\r\nin one eye signifies his glaucoma[BN] on one side is now urinating\r\nbefore me as I once urinated before him. In glaucoma I refer to cocaine,\r\nwhich stood my father in good stead in his operation, as though I had\r\nthereby fulfilled my promises. Besides that I make sport of him; since\r\nhe is blind I must hold the urinal in front of him, and I gloat over\r\nallusions to my discoveries in the theory of hysteria, of which I am so\r\nproud.[BO]\r\n\r\nIf the two childhood scenes of urinating are otherwise closely connected\r\nwith the desire for greatness, their rehabilitation on the trip to the\r\nAussee was further favoured by the accidental circumstance that my\r\ncompartment had no water-closet, and that I had to expect embarrassment\r\non the ride as actually happened in the morning. I awoke with the\r\nsensation of a bodily need. I suppose one might be inclined to credit\r\nthese sensations with being the actual stimulus of the dream; I should,\r\nhowever, prefer a different conception\xe2\x80\x94namely, that it was the dream\r\nthoughts which gave rise to the desire to urinate. It is quite unusual\r\nfor me to be disturbed in sleep by any need, at least at the time of\r\nthis awakening, a quarter of four in the morning. I may forestall\r\nfurther objection by remarking that I have hardly ever felt a desire to\r\nurinate after awakening early on other journeys made under more\r\ncomfortable circumstances. Moreover, I can leave this point undecided\r\nwithout hurting my argument.\r\n\r\nSince I have learned, further, from experience in dream analysis that\r\nthere always remain important trains of thought proceeding from dreams\r\nwhose interpretation at first seems complete (because the sources of the\r\ndream and the actuation of the wish are easily demonstrable), trains of\r\nthought reaching back into earliest childhood, I have been forced to ask\r\nmyself whether this feature does not constitute an essential condition\r\nof dreaming. If I were to generalise this thesis, a connection with what\r\nhas been recently experienced would form a part of the manifest content\r\nof every dream and a connection with what has been most remotely\r\nexperienced, of its latent content; and I can actually show in the\r\nanalysis of hysteria that in a true sense these remote experiences have\r\nremained recent up to the present time. But this conjecture seems still\r\nvery difficult to prove; I shall probably have to return to the part\r\nplayed by the earliest childhood experiences, in another connection\r\n(Chapter VII.).\r\n\r\nOf the three peculiarities of dream memory considered at the beginning,\r\none\xe2\x80\x94the preference for the unimportant in the dream content\xe2\x80\x94has been\r\nsatisfactorily explained by tracing it back to dream disfigurement. We\r\nhave been able to establish the existence of the other two\xe2\x80\x94the selection\r\nof recent and of infantile material\xe2\x80\x94but we have found it impossible to\r\nexplain them by the motive of dream. Let us keep in mind these two\r\ncharacteristics, which still remain to be explained or evaluated; a\r\nplace for them will have to be found elsewhere, either in the psychology\r\nof the sleeping state, or in the discussion of the structure of the\r\npsychic apparatus which we shall undertake later, after we have learned\r\nthat the inner nature of the apparatus may be observed through dream\r\ninterpretation as though through a window.\r\n\r\nJust here I may emphasize another result of the last few dream analyses.\r\nThe dream often appears ambiguous; not only may several\r\nwish-fulfilments, as the examples show, be united in it, but one meaning\r\nor one wish-fulfilment may also conceal another, until at the bottom one\r\ncomes upon the fulfilment of a wish from the earliest period of\r\nchildhood; and here too, it may be questioned whether \xe2\x80\x9coften\xe2\x80\x9d in this\r\nsentence may not more correctly be replaced by \xe2\x80\x9cregularly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n                   (_c_) _Somatic Sources of Dreams_\r\n\r\nIf the attempt be made to interest the cultured layman in the problems\r\nof dreaming, and if, with this end in view, he be asked the question\r\nfrom what source dreams originate according to his opinion, it is\r\ngenerally found that the person thus interrogated thinks himself in\r\nassured possession of a part of the solution. He immediately thinks of\r\nthe influence which a disturbed or impeded digestion (\xe2\x80\x9cDreams come from\r\nthe stomach\xe2\x80\x9d), accidental bodily position, and little occurrences during\r\nsleep, exercise upon the formation of dreams, and he seems not to\r\nsuspect that even after the consideration of all these factors there\r\nstill remains something unexplained.\r\n\r\nWe have explained at length in the introductory chapter (p. 16), what a\r\nr\xc3\xb4le in the formation of dreams the scientific literature credits to the\r\naccount of somatic exciting sources, so that we need here only recall\r\nthe results of this investigation. We have seen that three kinds of\r\nsomatic exciting sources are distinguished, objective sensory stimuli\r\nwhich proceed from external objects, the inner states of excitation of\r\nthe sensory organs having only a subjective basis, and the bodily\r\nstimuli which originate internally; and we have noticed the inclination\r\non the part of the authors to force the psychic sources of the dream\r\ninto the background or to disregard them altogether in favour of these\r\nsomatic sources of stimulation (p. 32).\r\n\r\nIn testing the claims which are made on behalf of these classes of\r\nsomatic sources of stimulation, we have discovered that the significance\r\nof the objective stimuli of the sensory organs\xe2\x80\x94whether accidental\r\nstimuli during sleep or those stimuli which cannot be excluded from our\r\ndormant psychic life\xe2\x80\x94has been definitely established by numerous\r\nobservations and is confirmed by experiments (p. 18); we have seen that\r\nthe part played by subjective sensory stimuli appears to be demonstrated\r\nby the return of hypnogogic sensory images in dreams, and that although\r\nthe referring of these dream images and ideas, in the broadest sense, to\r\ninternal bodily stimulation is not demonstrable in every detail, it can\r\nbe supported by the well-known influence which an exciting state of the\r\ndigestive, urinary, and sexual organs exercise upon the contents of our\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNerve stimulus\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbodily stimulus,\xe2\x80\x9d then, would be the somatic\r\nsources of the dream\xe2\x80\x94that is, the only sources whatever of the dream,\r\naccording to several authors.\r\n\r\nBut we have already found a number of doubts, which seem to attack not\r\nso much the correctness of the somatic theory of stimulation as its\r\nadequacy.\r\n\r\nHowever certain all the representatives of this theory may have felt\r\nabout the actual facts on which it is based\xe2\x80\x94especially in case of the\r\naccidental and external nerve stimuli, which may be recognised in the\r\ncontent of the dream without any trouble\xe2\x80\x94nevertheless none of them has\r\nbeen able to avoid the admission that the abundant ideal content of\r\ndreams does not admit of explanation by external nerve-stimuli alone.\r\nMiss Mary Whiton Calkins[12] has tested her own dreams and those of\r\nanother person for a period of six weeks with this idea in mind, and has\r\nfound only from 13\xc2\xb72 per cent. to 6\xc2\xb77 per cent. in which the element of\r\nexternal sensory perception was demonstrable; only two cases in the\r\ncollection could be referred to organic sensations. Statistics here\r\nconfirm what a hasty glance at our own experience might have led us to\r\nsuspect.\r\n\r\nThe decision has been made repeatedly to distinguish the \xe2\x80\x9cdream of nerve\r\nstimulus\xe2\x80\x9d from the other forms of the dream as a well-established\r\nsub-species. Spitta[64] divided dreams into dreams of nerve stimulus and\r\nassociation dreams. But the solution clearly remained unsatisfactory as\r\nlong as the link between the somatic sources of dreams and their ideal\r\ncontent could not be demonstrated.\r\n\r\nBesides the first objection, of the inadequate frequency of external\r\nexciting sources, there arises as a second objection the inadequate\r\nexplanation of dreams offered by the introduction of this sort of dream\r\nsources. The representatives of the theory accordingly must explain two\r\nthings, in the first place, why the external stimulus in the dream is\r\nnever recognised according to its real nature, but is regularly mistaken\r\nfor something else (_cf._ the alarm-clock dreams, p. 22), and secondly,\r\nwhy the reaction of the receiving mind to this misrecognised stimulus\r\nshould result so indeterminately and changefully. As an answer to these\r\nquestions, we have heard from Str\xc3\xbcmpell[66] that the mind, as a result\r\nof its being turned away from the outer world during sleep, is not\r\ncapable of giving correct interpretation to the objective sensory\r\nstimulus, but is forced to form illusions on the basis of the indefinite\r\nincitements from many directions. As expressed in his own words (p.\r\n108):\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as a sensation, a sensational complex, a feeling, or a psychic\r\nprocess in general, arises in the mind during sleep from an outer or\r\ninner nerve-stimulus, and is perceived by the mind, this process calls\r\nup sensory images, that is to say, earlier perceptions, either\r\nunembellished or with the psychic values belonging to them, from the\r\nrange of waking experiences, of which the mind has remained in\r\npossession. It seems to collect about itself, as it were, a greater or\r\nless number of such images, from which the impression which originates\r\nfrom the nerve-stimulus receives its psychic value. It is usually said\r\nhere, as the idiom does of waking thought, that the mind _interprets_\r\nimpressions of nerve-stimuli in sleep. The result of this interpretation\r\nis the so-called nerve-stimulus dream\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, a dream whose\r\ncomposition is conditioned by the fact that a nerve-stimulus brings\r\nabout its effect in psychic life according to the laws of reproduction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe opinion of Wundt[76] agrees in all essentials with this theory. He\r\nsays that the ideas in the dream are probably the result, for the most\r\npart, of sensory stimuli, especially of those of general sensation, and\r\nare therefore mostly phantastic illusions\xe2\x80\x94probably memory presentations\r\nwhich are only partly pure, and which have been raised to\r\nhallucinations. Str\xc3\xbcmpell has found an excellent simile (p. 84). It is\r\nas \xe2\x80\x9cif the ten fingers of a person ignorant of music should stray over\r\nthe keyboard of an instrument\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to illustrate the relation between dream\r\ncontent and dream stimuli, which follows from this theory. The\r\nimplication is that the dream does not appear as a psychic phenomenon,\r\noriginating from psychic motives, but as the result of a physiological\r\nstimulus, which is expressed in psychic symptomology, because the\r\napparatus which is affected by the stimulus is not capable of any other\r\nexpression. Upon a similar assumption is based, for example, the\r\nexplanation of compulsive ideas which Meynert tried to give by means of\r\nthe famous simile of the dial on which individual figures are prominent\r\nbecause they are in more marked relief.\r\n\r\nHowever popular this theory of somatic dream stimuli may have become,\r\nand however seductive it may seem, it is nevertheless easy to show the\r\nweak point in it. Every somatic dream stimulus which provokes the\r\npsychic apparatus to interpretation through the formation of illusions,\r\nis capable of giving rise to an incalculable number of such attempts at\r\ninterpretation; it can thus attain representation in the dream content\r\nby means of an extraordinary number of different ideas. But the theory\r\nof Str\xc3\xbcmpell and Wundt is incapable of instancing any motive which has\r\ncontrol over the relation between the external stimulus and the dream\r\nidea which has been selected to interpret it, and therefore of\r\nexplaining the \xe2\x80\x9cpeculiar choice\xe2\x80\x9d which the stimuli \xe2\x80\x9coften enough make in\r\nthe course of their reproductive activity\xe2\x80\x9d (Lipps, _Grundtatsachen des\r\nSeelenlebens_, p. 170). Other objections may be directed against the\r\nfundamental assumption of the whole theory of illusions\xe2\x80\x94the assumption\r\nthat during sleep the mind is not in a condition to recognise the real\r\nnature of the objective sensory stimuli. The old physiologist Burdach[8]\r\nproves to us that the mind is quite capable even during sleep of\r\ninterpreting correctly the sensory impressions which reach it, and of\r\nreacting in accordance with the correct interpretation. He establishes\r\nthis by showing that it is possible to exempt certain impressions which\r\nseem important to the individuals, from the neglect of sleeping (nurse\r\nand child), and that one is more surely awakened by one\xe2\x80\x99s own name than\r\nby an indifferent auditory impression, all of which presupposes, of\r\ncourse, that the mind distinguishes among sensations, even in sleep\r\n(Chapter I., p. 41). Burdach infers from these observations that it is\r\nnot an incapability of interpreting sensory stimuli in the sleeping\r\nstate which must be assumed, but a lack of interest in them. The same\r\narguments which Burdach used in 1830, later reappear unchanged in the\r\nworks of Lipps in the year 1883, where they are employed for the purpose\r\nof attacking the theory of somatic stimuli. According to this the mind\r\nseems to be like the sleeper in the anecdote, who, upon being asked,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you asleep?\xe2\x80\x9d answers \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d and upon being again addressed with the\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cThen lend me ten florins,\xe2\x80\x9d takes refuge in the excuse: \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nasleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe inadequacy of the theory of somatic dream stimuli may also be\r\ndemonstrated in another manner. Observations show that I am not urged to\r\ndream by external stimulations, even if these stimulations appear in the\r\ndream as soon as, and in case that, I dream. In response to the tactile\r\nor pressure stimulus which I get while sleeping, various reactions are\r\nat my disposal. I can overlook it and discover only upon awakening that\r\nmy leg has been uncovered or my arm under pressure; pathology shows the\r\nmost numerous examples where powerfully acting sensory and motor stimuli\r\nof different sorts remain without effect during sleep. I can perceive a\r\nsensation during sleep through and through sleep, as it were, which\r\nhappens as a rule with painful stimuli, but without weaving the pain\r\ninto the texture of the dream; thirdly, I can awaken on account of the\r\nstimulus in order to obviate it. Only as a fourth possible reaction, I\r\nmay be impelled to dream by a nerve stimulus; but the other\r\npossibilities are realised at least as often as that of dream formation.\r\nThis could not be the case if the _motive for dreaming did not lie\r\noutside of the somatic sources of dreams_.\r\n\r\nTaking proper account of the defect in the explanation of dreams by\r\nsomatic stimuli which has just been shown, other authors\xe2\x80\x94Scherner,[58]\r\nwho was joined by the philosopher Volkelt[72]\xe2\x80\x94have tried to determine\r\nmore exactly the psychic activities which cause the variegated dream\r\nimages to arise from the somatic stimuli, and have thus transferred the\r\nessential nature of dreams back to the province of the mind, and to that\r\nof psychic activity. Scherner not only gave a poetically appreciative,\r\nglowing and vivid description of the psychic peculiarities which develop\r\nin the course of dream formation; he also thought he had guessed the\r\nprinciple according to which the mind proceeds with the stimuli that are\r\nat its disposal. The dream activity, according to Scherner\xe2\x80\x94after\r\nphantasy has been freed from the shackles imposed upon it during the\r\nday, and has been given free rein\xe2\x80\x94strives to represent symbolically the\r\nnature of the organ from which the stimulus proceeds. Thus we have a\r\nkind of dream-book as a guide for the interpretation of dreams, by means\r\nof which bodily sensations, the conditions of the organs and of the\r\nstimuli may be inferred from dream images. \xe2\x80\x9cThus the image of a cat\r\nexpresses an angry discontented mood, the image of a light-coloured bit\r\nof smooth pastry the nudity of the body. The human body as a whole is\r\npictured as a house by the phantasy of the dream, and each individual\r\norgan of the body as a part of the house. In \xe2\x80\x98toothache-dreams\xe2\x80\x99 a high\r\nvaulted vestibule corresponds to the mouth and a stair to the descent of\r\nthe gullet to the alimentary canal; in the \xe2\x80\x98headache-dream\xe2\x80\x99 the ceiling\r\nof a room which is covered with disgusting reptile-like spiders is\r\nchosen to denote the upper part of the head\xe2\x80\x9d (Volkelt, p. 39). \xe2\x80\x9cSeveral\r\ndifferent symbols are used by the dream for the same organ, thus the\r\nbreathing lungs find their symbol in an oven filled with flames and with\r\na roaring draught, the heart in hollow chests and baskets, and the\r\nbladder in round, bag-shaped objects or anything else hollow. It is\r\nespecially important that at the end of a dream the stimulating organ or\r\nits function be represented undisguised and usually on the dreamer\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nbody. Thus the \xe2\x80\x98toothache-dream\xe2\x80\x99 usually ends by the dreamer drawing a\r\ntooth from his own mouth\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 35). It cannot be said that this theory\r\nhas found much favour with the authors. Above all, it seems extravagant;\r\nthere has been no inclination even to discover the small amount of\r\njustification to which it may, in my opinion, lay claim. As may be seen,\r\nit leads to a revival of the dream interpretation by means of symbolism,\r\nwhich the ancients used, except that the source from which the\r\ninterpretation is to be taken is limited to the human body. The lack of\r\na technique of interpretation which is scientifically comprehensible\r\nmust seriously limit the applicability of Scherner\xe2\x80\x99s theory.\r\nArbitrariness in dream interpretation seems in no wise excluded,\r\nespecially since a stimulus may be expressed by several representations\r\nin the content of the dream; thus Scherner\xe2\x80\x99s associate, Volkelt, has\r\nalready found it impossible to confirm the representation of the body as\r\na house. Another objection is that here again dream activity is\r\nattributed to the mind as a useless and aimless activity, since\r\naccording to the theory in question the mind is content with forming\r\nphantasies about the stimulus with which it is concerned, without even\r\nremotely contemplating anything like a discharge of the stimulus.\r\n\r\nBut Scherner\xe2\x80\x99s theory of the symbolisation of bodily stimuli by the\r\ndream receives a heavy blow from another objection. These bodily stimuli\r\nare present at all times, and according to general assumption the mind\r\nis more accessible to them during sleep than in waking. It is thus\r\nincomprehensible why the mind does not dream continually throughout the\r\nnight, and why it does not dream every night and about all the organs.\r\nIf one attempts to avoid this objection by making the condition that\r\nespecial stimuli must proceed from the eye, the ear, the teeth, the\r\nintestines in order to arouse dream activity, one is confronted by the\r\ndifficulty of proving that this increase of stimulation is objective,\r\nwhich is possible only in a small number of cases. If the dream of\r\nflying is a symbolisation of the upward and downward motion of the\r\npulmonary lobes, either this dream, as has already been remarked by\r\nStr\xc3\xbcmpell, would be dreamt much oftener, or an accentuation of the\r\nfunction of breathing during the dream would have to be demonstrable.\r\nStill another case is possible\xe2\x80\x94the most probable of all\xe2\x80\x94that now and\r\nthen special motives directing attention to the visceral sensations\r\nwhich are universally present are active, but this case takes us beyond\r\nthe range of Scherner\xe2\x80\x99s theory.\r\n\r\nThe value of Scherner\xe2\x80\x99s and Volkelt\xe2\x80\x99s discussions lies in the fact that\r\nthey call attention to a number of characteristics of the dream content\r\nwhich are in need of explanation, and which seem to promise new\r\nknowledge. It is quite true that symbolisations of organs of the body\r\nand of their functions are contained in dreams, that water in a dream\r\noften signifies a desire to urinate, that the male genital may often be\r\nrepresented by a staff standing erect or by a pillar, &c. In dreams\r\nwhich show a very animated field of vision and brilliant colours, in\r\ncontrast to the dimness of other dreams, the interpretation may hardly\r\nbe dismissed that they are \xe2\x80\x9cdreams of visual stimulation,\xe2\x80\x9d any more than\r\nit may be disputed that there is a contribution of illusory formations\r\nin dreams which contain noise and confusion of voices. A dream like that\r\nof Scherner, of two rows of fair handsome boys standing opposite to each\r\nother on a bridge, attacking each other and then taking their places\r\nagain, until finally the dreamer himself sits down on the bridge and\r\npulls a long tooth out of his jaw; or a similar one of Volkelt\xe2\x80\x99s, in\r\nwhich two rows of drawers play a part, and which again ends in the\r\nextraction of a tooth; dream formations of this sort, which are related\r\nin great numbers by the authors, prevent our discarding Scherner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntheory as an idle fabrication without seeking to find its kernel of\r\ntruth. We are now confronted by the task of giving the supposed\r\nsymbolisation of the dental stimulus an explanation of a different kind.\r\n\r\nThroughout our consideration of the theory of the somatic sources of\r\ndreams, I have refrained from urging the argument which is inferred from\r\nour dream analyses. If we have succeeded in proving, by a procedure\r\nwhich other authors have not applied in their investigation of dreams,\r\nthat the dream as a psychic action possesses value peculiar to itself,\r\nthat a wish supplies the motive for its formation, and that the\r\nexperiences of the previous day furnish the immediate material for its\r\ncontent, any other theory of dreams neglecting such an important method\r\nof investigation, and accordingly causing the dream to appear a useless\r\nand problematic psychic reaction to somatic stimuli, is dismissible\r\nwithout any particular comment. Otherwise there must be\xe2\x80\x94which is highly\r\nimprobable\xe2\x80\x94two entirely different kinds of dreams, of which only one has\r\ncome under our observation, while only the other has been observed by\r\nthe earlier connoisseurs of the dream. It still remains to provide a\r\nplace for the facts which are used to support the prevailing theory of\r\nsomatic dream-stimuli, within our own theory of dreams.\r\n\r\nWe have already taken the first step in this direction in setting up the\r\nthesis that the dream activity is under a compulsion to elaborate all\r\nthe dream stimuli which are simultaneously present into a unified whole\r\n(p. 151). We have seen that when two or more experiences capable of\r\nmaking an impression have been left over from the previous day, the\r\nwishes which result from them are united into one dream; similarly, that\r\nan impression possessing psychic value and the indifferent experiences\r\nof the previous day are united in the dream material, provided there are\r\navailable connecting ideas between the two. Thus the dream appears to be\r\na reaction to everything which is simultaneously present as actual in\r\nthe sleeping mind. As far as we have hitherto analysed the dream\r\nmaterial, we have discovered it to be a collection of psychic remnants\r\nand memory traces, which we were obliged to credit (on account of the\r\npreference shown for recent and infantile material) with a character of\r\nactuality, though the nature of this was not at the time determinable.\r\nNow it will not be difficult to foretell what will happen when new\r\nmaterial in the form of sensations is added to these actualities of\r\nmemory. These stimuli likewise derive importance for the dream because\r\nthey are actual; they are united with the other psychic actualities in\r\norder to make up the material for dream formation. To express it\r\ndifferently, the stimuli which appear during sleep are worked over into\r\nthe fulfilment of a wish, the other component parts of which are the\r\nremnants of daily experience with which we are familiar. This union,\r\nhowever, is not inevitable; we have heard that more than one sort of\r\nattitude towards bodily stimuli is possible during sleep. Wherever this\r\nunion has been brought about, it has simply been possible to find for\r\nthe dream content that kind of presentation material which will give\r\nrepresentation to both classes of dream sources, the somatic as well as\r\nthe psychic.\r\n\r\nThe essential nature of the dream is not changed by this addition of\r\nsomatic material to the psychic sources of the dream; it remains the\r\nfulfilment of a wish without reference to the way in which its\r\nexpression is determined by the actual material.\r\n\r\nI shall gladly find room here for a number of peculiarities, which serve\r\nto put a different face on the significance of external stimuli for the\r\ndream. I imagine that a co-operation of individual, physiological, and\r\naccidental factors, conditioned by momentary circumstances, determines\r\nhow one will act in each particular case of intensive objective\r\nstimulation during sleep; the degree of the profoundness of sleep\r\nwhether habitual or accidental in connection with the intensity of the\r\nstimulus, will in one case make it possible to suppress the stimulus, so\r\nthat it will not disturb sleep; in another case they will force an\r\nawakening or will support the attempt to overcome the stimulus by\r\nweaving it into the texture of the dream. In correspondence with the\r\nmultiplicity of these combinations, external objective stimuli will\r\nreceive expression more frequently in the case of one person than in\r\nthat of another. In the case of myself, who am an excellent sleeper, and\r\nwho stubbornly resists any kind of disturbance in sleep, this\r\nintermixture of external causes of irritation into my dreams is very\r\nrare, while psychic motives apparently cause me to dream very easily. I\r\nhave indeed noted only a single dream in which an objective, painful\r\nsource of stimulation is demonstrable, and it will be highly instructive\r\nto see what effect the external stimulus had in this very dream.\r\n\r\n_I am riding on a grey horse, at first timidly and awkwardly, as though\r\nI were only leaning against something. I meet a colleague P., who is\r\nmounted on a horse and is wearing a heavy woollen suit; he calls my\r\nattention to something (probably to the fact that my riding position is\r\nbad). Now I become more and more expert on the horse, which is most\r\nintelligent; I sit comfortably, and I notice that I am already quite at\r\nhome in the saddle. For a saddle I have a kind of padding, which\r\ncompletely fills the space between the neck and the rump of the horse.\r\nIn this manner I ride with difficulty between two lumber-wagons. After\r\nhaving ridden up the street for some distance, I turn around and want to\r\ndismount, at first in front of a little open chapel, which is situated\r\nclose to the street. Then I actually dismount in front of a chapel which\r\nstands near the first; the hotel is in the same street, I could let the\r\nhorse go there by itself, but I prefer to lead it there. It seems as if\r\nI should be ashamed to arrive there on horseback. In front of the hotel\r\nis standing a hall-boy who shows me a card of mine which has been found,\r\nand who ridicules me on account of it. On the card is written, doubly\r\nunderlined, \xe2\x80\x9cEat nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d and then a second sentence (indistinct)\r\nsomething like \xe2\x80\x9cDo not work\xe2\x80\x9d; at the same time a hazy idea that I am in\r\na strange city, in which I do no work._\r\n\r\nIt will not be apparent at once that this dream originated under the\r\ninfluence, or rather under the compulsion, of a stimulus of pain. The\r\nday before I had suffered from furuncles, which made every movement a\r\ntorture, and at last a furuncle had grown to the size of an apple at the\r\nroot of the scrotum, and had caused me the most intolerable pains that\r\naccompanied every step; a feverish lassitude, lack of appetite, and the\r\nhard work to which I had nevertheless kept myself during the day, had\r\nconspired with the pain to make me lose my temper. I was not altogether\r\nin a condition to discharge my duties as a physician, but in view of the\r\nnature and the location of the malady, one might have expected some\r\nperformance other than riding, for which I was very especially unfitted.\r\nIt is this very activity, of riding into which I am plunged by the\r\ndream; it is the most energetic denial of the suffering which is capable\r\nof being conceived. In the first place, I do not know how to ride, I do\r\nnot usually dream of it, and I never sat on a horse but once\xe2\x80\x94without a\r\nsaddle\xe2\x80\x94and then I did not feel comfortable. But in this dream I ride as\r\nthough I had no furuncle on the perineum, and why? _just because I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant any_. According to the description my saddle is the poultice which\r\nhas made it possible for me to go to sleep. Probably I did not feel\r\nanything of my pain\xe2\x80\x94as I was thus taken care of\xe2\x80\x94during the first few\r\nhours of sleeping. Then the painful sensations announced themselves and\r\ntried to wake me up, whereupon the dream came and said soothingly: \xe2\x80\x9cKeep\r\non sleeping, you won\xe2\x80\x99t wake up anyway! You have no furuncle at all, for\r\nyou are riding on a horse, and with a furuncle where you have it riding\r\nis impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d And the dream was successful; the pain was stifled, and\r\nI went on sleeping.\r\n\r\nBut the dream was not satisfied with \xe2\x80\x9csuggesting away\xe2\x80\x9d the furuncle by\r\nmeans of tenaciously adhering to an idea incompatible with that of the\r\nmalady, in doing which it behaved like the hallucinatory insanity of the\r\nmother who has lost her child, or like the merchant who has been\r\ndeprived of his fortune by losses.[BP] In addition the details of the\r\ndenied sensation and of the image which is used to displace it are\r\nemployed by the dream as a means to connect the material ordinarily\r\nactually present in the mind with the dream situation, and to give this\r\nmaterial representation. I am riding on a _grey_ horse\xe2\x80\x94the colour of the\r\nhorse corresponds exactly to the _pepper-and-salt_ costume in which I\r\nlast met my colleague P. in the country. I have been warned that highly\r\nseasoned food is the cause of furunculosis, but in any case it is\r\npreferable as an etiological explanation to sugar which ordinarily\r\nsuggests furunculosis. My friend P. has been pleased to \xe2\x80\x9cride the high\r\nhorse\xe2\x80\x9d with regard to me, ever since he superseded me in the treatment\r\nof a female patient, with whom I had performed great feats (in the dream\r\nI first sit on the horse side-saddle fashion, like a circus rider), but\r\nwho really led me wherever she wished, like the horse in the anecdote\r\nabout the Sunday equestrian. Thus the horse came to be a symbolic\r\nrepresentation of a lady patient (in the dream it is most intelligent).\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel quite at home up here,\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the position which I occupied\r\nin the patient\xe2\x80\x99s household until I was replaced by my colleague P. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought you were securely seated in the saddle,\xe2\x80\x9d one of my few\r\nwell-wishers among the great physicians of this city recently said to me\r\nwith reference to the same household. And it was a feat to practise\r\npsychotherapy for ten hours a day with such pains, but I know that I\r\ncannot continue my particularly difficult work for any length of time\r\nwithout complete physical health, and the dream is full of gloomy\r\nallusions to the situation which must in that case result (the card such\r\nas neurasthenics have and present to doctors): _No work and no food_.\r\nWith further interpretation I see that the dream activity has succeeded\r\nin finding the way from the wish-situation of riding to very early\r\ninfantile scenes of quarrelling, which must have taken place between me\r\nand my nephew, who is now living in England, and who, moreover, is a\r\nyear older than I. Besides it has taken up elements from my journeys to\r\nItaly; the street in the dream is composed of impressions of Verona and\r\nSiena. Still more exhaustive interpretation leads to sexual\r\ndream-thoughts, and I recall what significance dream allusions to that\r\nbeautiful country had in the case of a female patient who had never been\r\nin Italy (Itlay\xe2\x80\x94German _gen Italien_\xe2\x80\x94_Genitalien_\xe2\x80\x94genitals). At the same\r\ntime there are references to the house in which I was physician before\r\nmy friend P., and to the place where the furuncle is located.\r\n\r\nAmong the dreams mentioned in the previous chapter there are several\r\nwhich might serve as examples for the elaboration of so-called nerve\r\nstimuli. The dream about drinking in full draughts is one of this sort;\r\nthe somatic excitement in it seems to be the only source of the dream,\r\nand the wish resulting from the sensation\xe2\x80\x94thirst\xe2\x80\x94the only motive for\r\ndreaming. Something similar is true of the other simple dreams, if the\r\nsomatic excitement alone is capable of forming a wish. The dream of the\r\nsick woman who throws the cooling apparatus from her cheek at night is\r\nan instance of a peculiar way of reacting to painful excitements with a\r\nwish-fulfilment; it seems as though the patient had temporarily\r\nsucceeded in making herself analgesic by ascribing her pains to a\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\nMy dream about the three Parc\xc3\xa6 is obviously a dream of hunger, but it\r\nhas found means to refer the need for food back to the longing of the\r\nchild for its mother\xe2\x80\x99s breast, and to make the harmless desire a cloak\r\nfor a more serious one, which is not permitted to express itself so\r\nopenly. In the dream about Count Thun we have seen how an accidental\r\nbodily desire is brought into connection with the strongest, and\r\nlikewise the most strongly suppressed emotions of the psychic life. And\r\nwhen the First Consul incorporates the sound of an exploding bomb into a\r\ndream of battle before it causes him to wake, as in the case reported by\r\nGarnier, the purpose for which psychic activity generally concerns\r\nitself with sensations occurring during sleep is revealed with\r\nextraordinary clearness. A young lawyer, who has been deeply preoccupied\r\nwith his first great bankruptcy proceeding, and who goes to sleep during\r\nthe afternoon following, acts just like the great Napoleon. He dreams\r\nabout a certain G. Reich in _Hussiatyn_ (German _husten_\xe2\x80\x94to cough), whom\r\nhe knows in connection with the bankruptcy proceeding, but _Hussiatyn_\r\nforces itself upon his attention still further, with the result that he\r\nis obliged to awaken, and hears his wife\xe2\x80\x94who is suffering from bronchial\r\ncatarrh\xe2\x80\x94coughing violently.\r\n\r\nLet us compare the dream of Napoleon I., who, incidentally, was an\r\nexcellent sleeper, with that of the sleepy student, who was awakened by\r\nhis landlady with the admonition that he must go to the hospital, who\r\nthereupon dreams himself into a bed in the hospital, and then sleeps on,\r\nwith the following account of his motives: If I am already in the\r\nhospital, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t have to get up in order to go there. The latter is\r\nobviously a dream of convenience; the sleeper frankly admits to himself\r\nthe motive for his dreaming; but he thereby reveals one of the secrets\r\nof dreaming in general. In a certain sense all dreams are dreams of\r\nconvenience; they serve the purpose of continuing sleep instead of\r\nawakening. _The dream is the guardian of sleep, not the disturber of\r\nit._ We shall justify this conception with respect to the psychic\r\nfactors of awakening elsewhere; it is possible, however, at this point\r\nto prove its applicability to the influence exerted by objective\r\nexternal excitements. Either the mind does not concern itself at all\r\nwith the causes of sensations, if it is able to do this in spite of\r\ntheir intensity and of their significance, which is well understood by\r\nit; or it employs the dream to deny these stimuli; or thirdly, if it is\r\nforced to recognise the stimulus, it seeks to find that interpretation\r\nof the stimulus which shall represent the actual sensation as a\r\ncomponent part of a situation which is desired and which is compatible\r\nwith sleep. The actual sensation is woven into the dream _in order to\r\ndeprive it of its reality_. Napoleon is permitted to go on sleeping; it\r\nis only a dream recollection of the thunder of the cannon at Arcole\r\nwhich is trying to disturb him.[BQ]\r\n\r\n_The wish to sleep, by which the conscious ego has been suspended and\r\nwhich along with the dream-censor contributes its share to the dream,\r\nmust thus always be taken into account as a motive for the formation of\r\ndreams, and every successful dream is a fulfilment of this wish._ The\r\nrelation of this general, regularly present, and invariable sleep-wish\r\nto the other wishes, of which now the one, now the other is fulfilled,\r\nwill be the subject of a further explanation. In the wish to sleep we\r\nhave discovered a factor capable of supplying the deficiency in the\r\ntheory of Str\xc3\xbcmpell and Wundt, and of explaining the perversity and\r\ncapriciousness in the interpretation of the outer stimulus. The correct\r\ninterpretation, of which the sleeping mind is quite capable, would imply\r\nan active interest and would require that sleep be terminated; hence, of\r\nthose interpretations which are possible at all, only those are admitted\r\nwhich are agreeable to the absolute censorship of the somatic wish. It\r\nis something like this: It\xe2\x80\x99s the nightingale and not the lark. For if\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s the lark, love\xe2\x80\x99s night is at an end. From among the interpretations\r\nof the excitement which are at the moment possible, that one is selected\r\nwhich can secure the best connection with the wish-possibilities that\r\nare lying in wait in the mind. Thus everything is definitely determined,\r\nand nothing is left to caprice. The misinterpretation is not an\r\nillusion, but\xe2\x80\x94if you will\xe2\x80\x94an excuse. Here again, however, there is\r\nadmitted an action which is a modification of the normal psychic\r\nprocedure, as in the case where substitution by means of displacement is\r\neffected for the purposes of the dream-censor.\r\n\r\nIf the outer nerve stimuli and inner bodily stimuli are sufficiently\r\nintense to compel psychic attention, they represent\xe2\x80\x94that is, in case\r\nthey result in dreaming and not in awakening\xe2\x80\x94a definite point in the\r\nformation of dreams, a nucleus in the dream material, for which an\r\nappropriate wish-fulfilment is sought, in a way similar (see above) to\r\nthe search for connecting ideas between two dream stimuli. To this\r\nextent it is true for a number of dreams that the somatic determines\r\nwhat their content is to be. In this extreme case a wish which is not\r\nexactly actual is aroused for the purpose of dream formation. But the\r\ndream can do nothing but represent a wish in a situation as fulfilled;\r\nit is, as it were, confronted by the task of seeking what wish may be\r\nrepresented and fulfilled by means of the situation which is now actual.\r\nEven if this actual material is of a painful or disagreeable character,\r\nstill it is not useless for the purposes of dream formation. The psychic\r\nlife has control even over wishes the fulfilment of which brings forth\r\npleasure\xe2\x80\x94a statement which seems contradictory, but which becomes\r\nintelligible if one takes into account the presence of two psychic\r\ninstances and the censor existing between them.\r\n\r\nThere are in the psychic life, as we have heard, _repressed_ wishes\r\nwhich belong to the first system, and to whose fulfilment the second\r\nsystem is opposed. There are wishes of this kind\xe2\x80\x94and we do not mean this\r\nin an historic sense, that there have been such wishes and that these\r\nhave then been destroyed\xe2\x80\x94but the theory of repression, which is\r\nessential to the study of psychoneurosis, asserts that such repressed\r\nwishes still exist, contemporaneously with an inhibition weighing them\r\ndown. Language has hit upon the truth when it speaks of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csuppression\xe2\x80\x9d of such impulses. The psychic contrivance for bringing\r\nsuch wishes to realisation remains preserved and in a condition to be\r\nused. But if it happens that such a suppressed wish is fulfilled, the\r\nvanquished inhibition of the second system (which is capable of becoming\r\nconscious) is then expressed as a painful feeling. To close this\r\ndiscussion; if sensations of a disagreeable character which originate\r\nfrom somatic sources are presented during sleep, this constellation is\r\ntaken advantage of by the dream activity to represent the\r\nfulfilment\xe2\x80\x94with more or less retention of the censor\xe2\x80\x94of an otherwise\r\nsuppressed wish.\r\n\r\nThis condition of affairs makes possible a number of anxiety dreams,\r\nwhile another series of the dream formations which are unfavourable to\r\nthe wish theory exhibits a different mechanism. For anxiety in dreams\r\nmay be of a psychoneurotic nature, or it may originate in psychosexual\r\nexcitements, in which case the anxiety corresponds to a repressed\r\n_libido_. Then this anxiety as well as the whole anxiety dream has the\r\nsignificance of a neurotic symptom, and we are at the dividing-line\r\nwhere the wish-fulfilling tendency of dreams disappears. But in other\r\nanxiety-dreams the feeling of anxiety comes from somatic sources (for\r\ninstance in the case of persons suffering from pulmonary or heart\r\ntrouble, where there is occasional difficulty in getting breath), and\r\nthen it is used to aid those energetically suppressed wishes in\r\nattaining fulfilment in the form of a dream, the dreaming of which from\r\npsychic motives would have resulted in the same release of fear. It is\r\nnot difficult to unite these two apparently discrepant cases. Of two\r\npsychic formations, an emotional inclination and an ideal content, which\r\nare intimately connected, the one, which is presented as actual,\r\nsupports the other in the dream; now anxiety of somatic origin supports\r\nthe suppressed presentation content, now the ideal content, which is\r\nfreed from suppression, and which proceeds with the impetus given by\r\nsexual emotion, assists the discharge of anxiety. Of the one case it may\r\nbe said that an emotion of somatic origin is psychically interpreted; in\r\nthe other case everything is of psychic origin but the content which has\r\nbeen suppressed is easily replaced by a somatic interpretation which is\r\nsuited to anxiety. The difficulties which lie in the way of\r\nunderstanding all this have little to do with the dream; they are due to\r\nthe fact that in discussing these points we are touching upon the\r\nproblems of the development of anxiety and of repression.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the aggregate of bodily feelings is to be included among the\r\ncommanding dream stimuli which originate internally. Not that it is able\r\nto furnish the dream content, but it forces the dream thoughts to make a\r\nchoice from the material destined to serve the purpose of representation\r\nin the dream content; it does this by putting within easy reach that\r\npart of the material which is suited to its own character, while\r\nwithholding the other. Moreover this general feeling, which is left over\r\nfrom the day, is probably connected with the psychic remnants which are\r\nsignificant for the dream.\r\n\r\nIf somatic sources of excitement occurring during sleep\xe2\x80\x94that is, the\r\nsensations of sleep\xe2\x80\x94are not of unusual intensity, they play a part in\r\nthe formation of dreams similar, in my judgment, to that of the\r\nimpressions of the day which have remained recent but indifferent. I\r\nmean that they are drawn into the dream formation, if they are qualified\r\nfor being united with the presentation content of the psychic\r\ndream-source, but in no other case. They are treated as a cheap\r\never-ready material, which is utilised as often as it is needed, instead\r\nof prescribing, as a precious material does, the manner in which it is\r\nto be utilised. The case is similar to that where a patron of art brings\r\nto an artist a rare stone, a fragment of onyx, in order that a work of\r\nart may be made of it. The size of the stone, its colour, and its\r\nmarking help to decide what bust or what scene shall be represented in\r\nit, while in the case where there is a uniform and abundant supply of\r\nmarble or sandstone the artist follows only the idea which takes shape\r\nin his mind. Only in this manner, it seems to me, is the fact explicable\r\nthat the dream content resulting from bodily excitements that have not\r\nbeen accentuated to a usual degree, does not appear in all dreams and\r\nduring every night.\r\n\r\nPerhaps an example, which takes us back to the interpretation of dreams,\r\nwill best illustrate my meaning. One day I was trying to understand the\r\nmeaning of the sensations of being impeded, of not being able to move\r\nfrom the spot, of not being able to get finished, &c., which are dreamt\r\nabout so often, and which are so closely allied to anxiety. That night I\r\nhad the following dream: _I am very incompletely dressed, and I go from\r\na dwelling on the ground floor up a flight of stairs to an upper story.\r\nIn doing this I jump over three steps at a time, and I am glad to find I\r\ncan mount the steps so quickly. Suddenly I see that a servant girl is\r\ncoming down the stairs, that is, towards me. I am ashamed and try to\r\nhurry away, and now there appears that sensation of being impeded; I am\r\nglued to the steps and cannot move from the spot._\r\n\r\nAnalysis: The situation of the dream is taken from everyday reality. In\r\na house in Vienna I have two apartments, which are connected only by a\r\nflight of stairs outside. My consultation-rooms and my study are on an\r\nelevated portion of the ground floor, and one story higher are my\r\nliving-rooms. When I have finished my work downstairs late at night, I\r\ngo up the steps into my bedroom. On the evening before the dream I had\r\nactually gone this short distance in a somewhat disorderly attire\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nis to say, I had taken off my collar, cravat, and cuffs; but in the\r\ndream this has changed into a somewhat more advanced degree of undress,\r\nwhich as usual is indefinite. Jumping over the steps is my usual method\r\nof mounting stairs; moreover it is the fulfilment of a wish that has\r\nbeen recognised in the dream, for I have reassured myself about the\r\ncondition of my heart action by the ease of this accomplishment.\r\nMoreover the manner in which I climb the stairs is an effective contrast\r\nto the sensation of being impeded which occurs in the second half of the\r\ndream. It shows me\xe2\x80\x94something which needed no proof\xe2\x80\x94that the dream has no\r\ndifficulty in representing motor actions as carried out fully and\r\ncompletely; think of flying in dreams!\r\n\r\nBut the stairs which I go up are not those of my house; at first I do\r\nnot recognise them; only the person coming toward me reveals to me the\r\nlocation which they are intended to signify. This woman is the maid of\r\nthe old lady whom I visit twice daily to give hypodermic injections; the\r\nstairs, too, are quite similar to those which I must mount there twice\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\nHow do this flight of stairs and this woman get into my dream? Being\r\nashamed because one is not fully dressed, is undoubtedly of a sexual\r\ncharacter; the servant of whom I dream is older than I, sulky, and not\r\nin the least attractive. These questions call up exactly the following\r\noccurrences: When I make my morning visit at this house I am usually\r\nseized with a desire to clear my throat; the product of the\r\nexpectoration falls upon the steps. For there is no spittoon on either\r\nof these floors, and I take the view that the stairs should not be kept\r\nclean at my expense, but by the provision of a spittoon. The\r\nhousekeeper, likewise an elderly and sulky person, with instincts for\r\ncleanliness, takes another view of the matter. She lies in wait for me\r\nto see whether I take the liberty referred to, and when she has made\r\nsure of it, I hear her growl distinctly. For days thereafter she refuses\r\nto show me her customary regard when we meet. On the day before the\r\ndream the position of the housekeeper had been strengthened by the\r\nservant girl. I had just finished my usual hurried visit to the patient\r\nwhen the servant confronted me in the ante-room and observed: \xe2\x80\x9cYou might\r\nas well have wiped your shoes to-day, doctor, before you came into the\r\nroom. The red carpet is all dirty again from your feet.\xe2\x80\x9d This is the\r\nwhole claim which the flight of stairs and the servant-girl can make for\r\nappearing in my dream.\r\n\r\nAn intimate connection exists between my flying over the stairs and my\r\nspitting on the stairs. Pharyngitis and diseases of the heart are both\r\nsaid to be punishments for the vice of smoking, on account of which\r\nvice, of course, I do not enjoy a reputation for great neatness with my\r\nhousekeeper in the one house any more than in the other, both of which\r\nthe dream fuses into a single image.\r\n\r\nI must postpone the further interpretation of this dream until I can\r\ngive an account of the origin of the typical dream of incomplete dress.\r\nI only note as a preliminary result from the dream which has just been\r\ncited that the dream sensation of inhibited action is always aroused at\r\na point where a certain connection requires it. A peculiar condition of\r\nmy motility during sleep cannot be the cause of this dream content, for\r\na moment before I saw myself hurrying over the steps with ease, as\r\nthough in confirmation of this fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         (_d_) _Typical Dreams_\r\n\r\nIn general we are not in a position to interpret the dream of another\r\nperson if he is unwilling to furnish us with the unconscious thoughts\r\nwhich lie behind the dream content, and for this reason the practical\r\napplicability of our method of dream interpretation is seriously\r\ncurtailed.[BR] But there are a certain number of dreams\xe2\x80\x94in contrast with\r\nthe usual freedom displayed by the individual in fashioning his dream\r\nworld with characteristic peculiarity, and thereby making it\r\nunintelligible\xe2\x80\x94which almost every one has dreamed in the same manner,\r\nand of which we are accustomed to assume that they have the same\r\nsignificance in the case of every dreamer. A peculiar interest belongs\r\nto these typical dreams for the reason that they probably all come from\r\nthe same sources with every person, that they are thus particularly\r\nsuited to give us information upon the sources of dreams.\r\n\r\nTypical dreams are worthy of the most exhaustive investigation. I shall,\r\nhowever, only give a somewhat detailed consideration to examples of this\r\nspecies, and for this purpose I shall first select the so-called\r\nembarrassment dream of nakedness, and the dream of the death of dear\r\nrelatives.\r\n\r\nThe dream of being naked or scantily clad in the presence of strangers\r\noccurs with the further addition that one is not at all ashamed of it,\r\n&c. But the dream of nakedness is worthy of our interest only when shame\r\nand embarrassment are felt in it, when one wishes to flee or to hide,\r\nand when one feels the strange inhibition that it is impossible to move\r\nfrom the spot and that one is incapable of altering the disagreeable\r\nsituation. It is only in this connection that the dream is typical; the\r\nnucleus of its content may otherwise be brought into all kinds of\r\nrelations or may be replaced by individual amplifications. It is\r\nessentially a question of a disagreeable sensation of the nature of\r\nshame, the wish to be able to hide one\xe2\x80\x99s nakedness, chiefly by means of\r\nlocomotion, without being able to accomplish this. I believe that the\r\ngreat majority of my readers will at some time have found themselves in\r\nthis situation in a dream.\r\n\r\nUsually the nature and manner of the experience is indistinct. It is\r\nusually reported, \xe2\x80\x9cI was in my shirt,\xe2\x80\x9d but this is rarely a clear image;\r\nin most cases the lack of clothing is so indeterminate that it is\r\ndesignated in the report of the dream by a set of alternatives: \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nin my chemise or in my petticoat.\xe2\x80\x9d As a rule the deficiency in the\r\ntoilet is not serious enough to justify the feeling of shame attached to\r\nit. For a person who has served in the army, nakedness is often replaced\r\nby a mode of adjustment that is contrary to regulations. \xe2\x80\x9cI am on the\r\nstreet without my sabre and I see officers coming,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI am without my\r\nnecktie,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI am wearing checkered civilian\xe2\x80\x99s trousers,\xe2\x80\x9d &c.\r\n\r\nThe persons before whom one is ashamed are almost always strangers with\r\nfaces that have been left undetermined. It never occurs in the typical\r\ndream that one is reproved or even noticed on account of the dress which\r\ncauses the embarrassment to one\xe2\x80\x99s self. Quite on the contrary, the\r\npeople have an air of indifference, or, as I had opportunity to observe\r\nin a particularly clear dream, they look stiffly solemn. This is worth\r\nthinking about.\r\n\r\nThe shamed embarrassment of the dreamer and the indifference of the\r\nspectators form a contradiction which often occurs in the dream. It\r\nwould better accord with the feelings of the dreamer if the strangers\r\nlooked at him in astonishment and laughed at him, or if they grew\r\nindignant. I think, however, that the latter unpleasant feature has been\r\nobviated by the tendency to wish-fulfilment, while the embarrassment,\r\nbeing retained on some account or other, has been left standing, and\r\nthus the two parts fail to agree. We have interesting evidence to show\r\nthat the dream, whose appearance has been partially disfigured by the\r\ntendency to wish-fulfilment, has not been properly understood. For it\r\nhas become the basis of a fairy tale familiar to us all in Andersen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nversion,[BS] and it has recently received poetic treatment by L. Fulda\r\nin the _Talisman_. In Andersen\xe2\x80\x99s fairy tale we are told of two impostors\r\nwho weave a costly garment for the Emperor, which, however, shall be\r\nvisible only to the good and true. The Emperor goes forth clad in this\r\ninvisible garment, and, the fabric serving as a sort of touchstone, all\r\nthe people are frightened into acting as though they did not notice the\r\nnakedness of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nBut such is the situation in our dream. It does not require great\r\nboldness to assume that the unintelligible dream content has suggested\r\nthe invention of a state of undress in which the situation that is being\r\nremembered becomes significant. This situation has then been deprived of\r\nits original meaning, and placed at the service of other purposes. But\r\nwe shall see that such misunderstanding of the dream content often\r\noccurs on account of the conscious activity of the second psychic\r\nsystem, and is to be recognised as a factor in the ultimate formation of\r\nthe dream; furthermore, that in the development of the obsessions and\r\nphobias similar misunderstandings, likewise within the same psychic\r\npersonality, play a leading part. The source from which in our dream the\r\nmaterial for this transformation is taken can also be explained. The\r\nimpostor is the dream, the Emperor is the dreamer himself, and the\r\nmoralising tendency betrays a hazy knowledge of the fact that the latent\r\ndream content is occupied with forbidden wishes which have become the\r\nvictims of repression. The connection in which such dreams appear during\r\nmy analysis of neurotics leaves no room for doubting that the dream is\r\nbased upon a recollection from earliest childhood. Only in our childhood\r\nwas there a time when we were seen by our relatives as well as by\r\nstrange nurses, servant girls, and visitors, in scanty clothing, and at\r\nthat time we were not ashamed of our nakedness.[BT]\r\n\r\nIt may be observed in the case of children who are a little older that\r\nbeing undressed has a kind of intoxicating effect upon them, instead of\r\nmaking them ashamed. They laugh, jump about, and strike their bodies;\r\nthe mother, or whoever is present, forbids them to do this, and says:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFie, that is shameful\xe2\x80\x94you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\xe2\x80\x9d Children often show\r\nexhibitional cravings; it is hardly possible to go through a village in\r\nour part of the country without meeting a two or three-year-old tot who\r\nlifts up his or her shirt before the traveller, perhaps in his honour.\r\nOne of my patients has reserved in his conscious memory a scene from the\r\neighth year of his life in which he had just undressed previous to going\r\nto bed, and was about to dance into the room of his little sister in his\r\nundershirt when the servant prevented his doing it. In the childhood\r\nhistory of neurotics, denudation in the presence of children of the\r\nopposite sex plays a great part; in paranoia the desire to be observed\r\nwhile dressing and undressing may be directly traced to these\r\nexperiences; among those remaining perverted there is a class which has\r\naccentuated the childish impulse to a compulsion\xe2\x80\x94they are the\r\nexhibitionists.\r\n\r\nThis age of childhood in which the sense of shame is lacking seems to\r\nour later recollections a Paradise, and Paradise itself is nothing but a\r\ncomposite phantasy from the childhood of the individual. It is for this\r\nreason, too, that in Paradise human beings are naked and are not ashamed\r\nuntil the moment arrives when the sense of shame and of fear are\r\naroused; expulsion follows, and sexual life and cultural development\r\nbegin. Into this Paradise the dream can take us back every night; we\r\nhave already ventured the conjecture that the impressions from earliest\r\nchildhood (from the prehistoric period until about the end of the fourth\r\nyear) in themselves, and independently of everything else, crave\r\nreproduction, perhaps without further reference to their content, and\r\nthat the repetition of them is the fulfilment of a wish. Dreams of\r\nnakedness, then, are exhibition dreams.[BU]\r\n\r\nOne\xe2\x80\x99s own person, which is seen not as that of a child, but as belonging\r\nto the present, and the idea of scanty clothing, which became buried\r\nbeneath so many later _n\xc3\xa9glig\xc3\xa9e_ recollections or because of the censor,\r\nturns out to be obscure\xe2\x80\x94these two things constitute the nucleus of the\r\nexhibition dream. Next come the persons before whom one is ashamed. I\r\nknow of no example where the actual spectators at those infantile\r\nexhibitions reappear in the dream. For the dream is hardly ever a simple\r\nrecollection. Strangely enough, those persons who are the objects of our\r\nsexual interest during childhood are omitted from all the reproductions\r\nof the dream, of hysteria, and of the compulsion neurosis; paranoia\r\nalone puts the spectators back into their places, and is fanatically\r\nconvinced of their presence, although they remain invisible. What the\r\ndream substitutes for these, the \xe2\x80\x9cmany strange people,\xe2\x80\x9d who take no\r\nnotice of the spectacle which is presented, is exactly the wish-opposite\r\nof that single, intimate person for whom the exposure was intended.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany strange people,\xe2\x80\x9d moreover, are often found in the dream in any\r\nother favourable connection; as a wish-opposite they always signify \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nsecret.\xe2\x80\x9d[BV] It may be seen how the restoration of the old condition of\r\naffairs, as it occurs in paranoia, is subject to this antithesis. One is\r\nno longer alone. One is certainly being watched, but the spectators are\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmany strange, curiously indeterminate people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFurthermore, repression has a place in the exhibition dream. For the\r\ndisagreeable sensation of the dream is the reaction of the second\r\npsychic instance to the fact that the exhibition scene which has been\r\nrejected by it has in spite of this succeeded in securing\r\nrepresentation. The only way to avoid this sensation would be not to\r\nrevive the scene.\r\n\r\nLater on we shall again deal with the sensation of being inhibited. It\r\nserves the dream excellently in representing the conflict of the will,\r\nthe negation. According to our unconscious purpose exhibition is to be\r\ncontinued; according to the demands of the censor, it is to be stopped.\r\n\r\nThe relation of our typical dreams to fairy tales and to other poetic\r\nmaterial is neither a sporadic nor an accidental one. Occasionally the\r\nkeen insight of a poet has analytically recognised the transforming\r\nprocess\xe2\x80\x94of which the poet is usually the tool\xe2\x80\x94and has followed it\r\nbackwards, that is to say, traced it to the dream. A friend has called\r\nmy attention to the following passage in G. Keller\xe2\x80\x99s _Der Gr\xc3\xbcne\r\nHeinrich_: \xe2\x80\x9cI do not wish, dear Lee, that you should ever come to\r\nrealise from experience the peculiar piquant truth contained in the\r\nsituation of Odysseus, when he appears before Nausikaa and her\r\nplaymates, naked and covered with mud! Would you like to know what it\r\nmeans? Let us consider the incident closely. If you are ever separated\r\nfrom your home, and from everything that is dear to you, and wander\r\nabout in a strange country, when you have seen and experienced much,\r\nwhen you have cares and sorrows, and are, perhaps, even miserable and\r\nforlorn, you will some night inevitably dream that you are approaching\r\nyour home; you will see it shining and beaming in the most beautiful\r\ncolours; charming, delicate and lovely figures will come to meet you;\r\nand you will suddenly discover that you are going about in rags, naked\r\nand covered with dust. A nameless feeling of shame and fear seizes you,\r\nyou try to cover yourself and to hide, and you awaken bathed in sweat.\r\nAs long as men exist, this will be the dream of the care-laden,\r\nfortune-battered man, and thus Homer has taken his situation from the\r\nprofoundest depths of the eternal character of humanity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis profound and eternal character of humanity, upon the touching of\r\nwhich in his listeners the poet usually calculates, is made up of the\r\nstirrings of the spirit which are rooted in childhood, in the period\r\nwhich later becomes prehistoric. Suppressed and forbidden wishes of\r\nchildhood break forth under cover of those wishes of the homeless man\r\nwhich are unobjectionable and capable of becoming conscious, and for\r\nthat reason the dream which is made objective in the legend of Nausikaa\r\nregularly assumes the form of a dream of anxiety.\r\n\r\nMy own dream, mentioned on p. 201, of hurrying up the stairs, which is\r\nsoon afterward changed into that of being glued to the steps, is\r\nlikewise an exhibition dream, because it shows the essential components\r\nof such a dream. It must thus permit of being referred to childish\r\nexperiences, and the possession of these ought to tell us how far the\r\nbehaviour of the servant girl towards me\xe2\x80\x94her reproach that I had soiled\r\nthe carpet\xe2\x80\x94helped her to secure the position which she occupies in the\r\ndream. I am now able to furnish the desired explanation. One learns in\r\npsychoanalysis to interpret temporal proximity by objective connection;\r\ntwo thoughts, apparently without connection, which immediately follow\r\none another, belong to a unity which can be inferred; just as an _a_ and\r\na _t_, which I write down together, should be pronounced as one\r\nsyllable, _at_. The same is true of the relation of dreams to one\r\nanother. The dream just cited, of the stairs, has been taken from a\r\nseries of dreams, whose other members I am familiar with on account of\r\nhaving interpreted them. The dream which is included in this series must\r\nbelong to the same connection. Now the other dreams of the series are\r\nbased upon the recollection of a nurse to whom I was entrusted from some\r\ntime in the period when I was suckling to the age of two and a half\r\nyears, and of whom a hazy recollection has remained in my consciousness.\r\nAccording to information which I have recently obtained from my mother,\r\nshe was old and ugly, but very intelligent and thorough; according to\r\ninferences which I may draw from my dreams, she did not always give me\r\nthe kindest treatment, and said hard words to me when I showed\r\ninsufficient aptitude for education in cleanliness. Thus by attempting\r\nto continue this educational work the servant girl develops a claim to\r\nbe treated by me, in the dream, as an incarnation of the prehistoric old\r\nwoman. It is to be assumed that the child bestowed his love upon this\r\ngoverness in spite of her bad treatment of him.[BW]\r\n\r\nAnother series of dreams which might be called typical are those which\r\nhave the content that a dear relative, parent, brother, or sister, child\r\nor the like, has died. Two classes of these dreams must immediately be\r\ndistinguished\xe2\x80\x94those in which the dreamer remains unaffected by sorrow\r\nwhile dreaming, and those in which he feels profound grief on account of\r\nthe death, in which he even expresses this grief during sleep by fervid\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nWe may ignore the dreams of the first group; they have no claim to be\r\nreckoned as typical. If they are analysed, it is found that they signify\r\nsomething else than what they contain, that they are intended to cover\r\nup some other wish. Thus it is with the dream of the aunt who sees the\r\nonly son of her sister lying on a bier before her (p 129). This does not\r\nsignify that she wishes the death of her little nephew; it only\r\nconceals, as we have learned, a wish to see a beloved person once more\r\nafter long separation\xe2\x80\x94the same person whom she had seen again after a\r\nsimilar long intermission at the funeral of another nephew. This wish,\r\nwhich is the real content of the dream, gives no cause for sorrow, and\r\nfor that reason no sorrow is felt in the dream. It may be seen in this\r\ncase that the emotion which is contained in the dream does not belong to\r\nthe manifest content of the dream, but to the latent one, and that the\r\nemotional content has remained free from the disfigurement which has\r\nbefallen the presentation content.\r\n\r\nIt is a different story with the dreams in which the death of a beloved\r\nrelative is imagined and where sorrowful emotion is felt. These signify,\r\nas their content says, the wish that the person in question may die, and\r\nas I may here expect that the feelings of all readers and of all persons\r\nwho have dreamt anything similar will object to my interpretation, I\r\nmust strive to present my proof on the broadest possible basis.\r\n\r\nWe have already had one example to show that the wishes represented in\r\nthe dream as fulfilled are not always actual wishes. They may also be\r\ndead, discarded, covered, and repressed wishes, which we must\r\nnevertheless credit with a sort of continuous existence on account of\r\ntheir reappearance in the dream. They are not dead like persons who have\r\ndied in our sense, but they resemble the shades in the _Odyssey_ which\r\nawaken a certain kind of life as soon as they have drunk blood. In the\r\ndream of the dead child in the box (p. 130) we were concerned with a\r\nwish that had been actual fifteen years before, and which had been\r\nfrankly admitted from that time. It is, perhaps, not unimportant from\r\nthe point of view of dream theory if I add that a recollection from\r\nearliest childhood is at the basis even of this dream. While the dreamer\r\nwas a little child\xe2\x80\x94it cannot be definitely determined at what time\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nhad heard that during pregnancy of which she was the fruit her mother\r\nhad fallen into a profound depression of spirits and had passionately\r\nwished for the death of her child before birth. Having grown up herself\r\nand become pregnant, she now follows the example of her mother.\r\n\r\nIf some one dreams with expressions of grief that his father or mother,\r\nhis brother or sister, has died, I shall not use the dream as a proof\r\nthat he wishes them dead _now_. The theory of the dreams does not\r\nrequire so much; it is satisfied with concluding that the dreamer has\r\nwished them dead\xe2\x80\x94at some one time in childhood. I fear, however, that\r\nthis limitation will not contribute much to quiet the objectors; they\r\nmight just as energetically contest the possibility that they have ever\r\nhad such thoughts as they are sure that they do not cherish such wishes\r\nat present. I must, therefore, reconstruct a part of the submerged\r\ninfantile psychology on the basis of the testimony which the present\r\nstill furnishes.[BX]\r\n\r\nLet us at first consider the relation of children to their brothers and\r\nsisters. I do not know why we presuppose that it must be a loving one,\r\nsince examples of brotherly and sisterly enmity among adults force\r\nthemselves upon every one\xe2\x80\x99s experience, and since we so often know that\r\nthis estrangement originated even during childhood or has always\r\nexisted. But many grown-up people, who to-day are tenderly attached to\r\ntheir brothers and sisters and stand by them, have lived with them\r\nduring childhood in almost uninterrupted hostility. The older child has\r\nill-treated the younger, slandered it, and deprived it of its toys; the\r\nyounger has been consumed by helpless fury against the elder, has envied\r\nit and feared it, or its first impulse toward liberty and first feelings\r\nof injustice have been directed against the oppressor. The parents say\r\nthat the children do not agree, and cannot find the reason for it. It is\r\nnot difficult to see that the character even of a well-behaved child is\r\nnot what we wish to find in a grown-up person. The child is absolutely\r\negotistical; it feels its wants acutely and strives remorselessly to\r\nsatisfy them, especially with its competitors, other children, and in\r\nthe first instance with its brothers and sisters. For doing this we do\r\nnot call the child wicked\xe2\x80\x94we call it naughty; it is not responsible for\r\nits evil deeds either in our judgment or in the eyes of the penal law.\r\nAnd this is justifiably so; for we may expect that within this very\r\nperiod of life which we call childhood, altruistic impulses and morality\r\nwill come to life in the little egotist, and that, in the words of\r\nMeynert, a secondary ego will overlay and restrain the primary one. It\r\nis true that morality does not develop simultaneously in all\r\ndepartments, and furthermore, the duration of the unmoral period of\r\nchildhood is of different length in different individuals. In cases\r\nwhere the development of this morality fails to appear, we are pleased\r\nto talk about \xe2\x80\x9cdegeneration\xe2\x80\x9d; they are obviously cases of arrested\r\ndevelopment. Where the primary character has already been covered up by\r\nlater development, it may be at least partially uncovered again by an\r\nattack of hysteria. The correspondence between the so-called hysterical\r\ncharacter and that of a naughty child is strikingly evident. A\r\ncompulsion neurosis, on the other hand, corresponds to a super-morality,\r\nimposed upon the primary character that is again asserting itself, as an\r\nincreased check.\r\n\r\nMany persons, then, who love their brothers and sisters, and who would\r\nfeel bereaved by their decease, have evil wishes towards them from\r\nearlier times in their unconscious wishes, which are capable of being\r\nrealised in the dream. It is particularly interesting to observe little\r\nchildren up to three years old in their attitude towards their brothers\r\nand sisters. So far the child has been the only one; he is now informed\r\nthat the stork has brought a new child. The younger surveys the arrival,\r\nand then expresses his opinion decidedly: \xe2\x80\x9cThe stork had better take it\r\nback again.\xe2\x80\x9d[BY]\r\n\r\nI subscribe in all seriousness to the opinion that the child knows\r\nenough to calculate the disadvantage it has to expect on account of the\r\nnew-comer. I know in the case of a lady of my acquaintance who agrees\r\nvery well with a sister four years younger than herself, that she\r\nresponded to the news of her younger sister\xe2\x80\x99s arrival with the following\r\nwords: \xe2\x80\x9cBut I shan\xe2\x80\x99t give her my red cap, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d If the child comes to\r\nthis realisation only at a later time, its enmity will be aroused at\r\nthat point. I know of a case where a girl, not yet three years old,\r\ntried to strangle a suckling in the cradle, because its continued\r\npresence, she suspected, boded her no good. Children are capable of envy\r\nat this time of life in all its intensity and distinctness. Again,\r\nperhaps, the little brother or sister has really soon disappeared; the\r\nchild has again drawn the entire affection of the household to itself,\r\nand then a new child is sent by the stork; is it then unnatural for the\r\nfavourite to wish that the new competitor may have the same fate as the\r\nearlier one, in order that he may be treated as well as he was before\r\nduring the interval? Of course this attitude of the child towards the\r\nyounger infant is under normal circumstances a simple function of the\r\ndifference of age. After a certain time the maternal instincts of the\r\ngirl will be excited towards the helpless new-born child.\r\n\r\nFeelings of enmity towards brothers and sisters must occur far more\r\nfrequently during the age of childhood than is noted by the dull\r\nobservation of adults.\r\n\r\nIn case of my own children, who followed one another rapidly, I missed\r\nthe opportunity to make such observations; I am now retrieving it\r\nthrough my little nephew, whose complete domination was disturbed after\r\nfifteen months by the arrival of a female competitor. I hear, it is\r\ntrue, that the young man acts very chivalrously towards his little\r\nsister, that he kisses her hand and pets her; but in spite of this I\r\nhave convinced myself that even before the completion of his second year\r\nhe is using his new facility in language to criticise this person who\r\nseems superfluous to him. Whenever the conversation turns upon her, he\r\nchimes in and cries angrily: \xe2\x80\x9cToo (l)ittle, too (l)ittle.\xe2\x80\x9d During the\r\nlast few months, since the child has outgrown this unfavourable\r\ncriticism, owing to its splendid development, he has found another way\r\nof justifying his insistence that she does not deserve so much\r\nattention. On all suitable occasions he reminds us, \xe2\x80\x9cShe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t any\r\nteeth.\xe2\x80\x9d[BZ] We have all preserved the recollection of the eldest\r\ndaughter of another sister of mine\xe2\x80\x94how the child which was at that time\r\nsix years old sought assurance from one aunt after another for an hour\r\nand a half with the question: \xe2\x80\x9cLucy can\xe2\x80\x99t understand that yet, can she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nLucy was the competitor, two and a half years younger.\r\n\r\nI have never failed in any of my female patients to find this dream of\r\nthe death of brothers and sisters denoting exaggerated hostility. I have\r\nmet with only one exception, which could easily be reinterpreted into a\r\nconfirmation of the rule. Once in the course of a sitting while I was\r\nexplaining this condition of affairs to a lady, as it seemed to have a\r\nbearing upon the symptoms under consideration, she answered, to my\r\nastonishment, that she had never had such dreams. However, she thought\r\nof another dream which supposedly had nothing to do with the matter\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ndream which she had first dreamed at the age of four, when she was the\r\nyoungest child, and had since dreamed repeatedly. \xe2\x80\x9cA great number of\r\nchildren, all of them the dreamer\xe2\x80\x99s brothers and sisters, and male and\r\nfemale cousins, were romping about in a meadow. Suddenly they all got\r\nwings, flew up, and were gone.\xe2\x80\x9d She had no idea of the significance of\r\nthe dream; but it will not be difficult for us to recognise it as a\r\ndream of the death of all the brothers and sisters, in its original\r\nform, and little influenced by the censor. I venture to insert the\r\nfollowing interpretation: At the death of one out of a large number of\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x94in this case the children of two brothers were brought up in\r\ncommon as brothers and sisters\xe2\x80\x94is it not probable that our dreamer, at\r\nthat time not yet four years old, asked a wise, grown-up person: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nbecomes of children when they are dead?\xe2\x80\x9d The answer probably was: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nget wings and become angels.\xe2\x80\x9d According to this explanation all the\r\nbrothers and sisters and cousins in the dream now have wings like angels\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94this is the important thing\xe2\x80\x94they fly away. Our little angel-maker\r\nremains alone, think of it, the only one after such a multitude! The\r\nfeature that the children are romping about on a meadow points with\r\nlittle ambiguity to butterflies, as though the child had been led by the\r\nsame association which induced the ancients to conceive Psyche as having\r\nthe wings of a butterfly.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some one will now object that, although the inimical impulses of\r\nchildren towards their brothers and sisters may well enough be admitted,\r\nhow does the childish disposition arrive at such a height of wickedness\r\nas to wish death to a competitor or stronger playmate, as though all\r\ntransgressions could be atoned for only by the death-punishment? Whoever\r\ntalks in this manner forgets that the childish idea of \xe2\x80\x9cbeing dead\xe2\x80\x9d has\r\nlittle else but the words in common with our own. The child knows\r\nnothing of the horrors of decay, of shivering in the cold grave, of the\r\nterror of the infinite Nothing, which the grown-up person, as all the\r\nmyths concerning the Great Beyond testify, finds it so hard to bear in\r\nhis conception. Fear of death is strange to the child; therefore it\r\nplays with the horrible word and threatens another child: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you do\r\nthat again you will die, as Francis died,\xe2\x80\x9d whereat the poor mother\r\nshudders, for perhaps she cannot forget that the great majority of\r\nmortals do not succeed in living beyond the years of childhood. It is\r\nstill possible, even for a child eight years old, on returning from a\r\nmuseum of natural history, to say to its mother: \xe2\x80\x9cMamma, I love you so;\r\nif you ever die, I am going to have you stuffed and set you up here in\r\nthe room so I can always, always see you!\xe2\x80\x9d So little does the childish\r\nconception of being dead resemble our own.[CA]\r\n\r\nBeing dead means for the child, which has been spared the scenes of\r\nsuffering previous to dying, the same as \xe2\x80\x9cbeing gone,\xe2\x80\x9d not disturbing\r\nthe survivors any more. The child does not distinguish the manner and\r\nmeans by which this absence is brought about, whether by travelling,\r\nestrangement, or death. If, during the prehistoric years of a child, a\r\nnurse has been sent away and its mother has died a short while after,\r\nthe two experiences, as is revealed by analysis, overlap in his memory.\r\nThe fact that the child does not miss very intensely those who are\r\nabsent has been realised by many a mother to her sorrow, after she has\r\nreturned home after a summer journey of several weeks, and has been told\r\nupon inquiry: \xe2\x80\x9cThe children have not asked for their mother a single\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d But if she really goes to that \xe2\x80\x9cundiscovered country from whose\r\nbourn no traveller returns,\xe2\x80\x9d the children seem at first to have\r\nforgotten her, and begin only _subsequently_ to remember the dead\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the child has motives for wishing the absence of another\r\nchild, every restraint is lacking which would prevent it from clothing\r\nthis wish in the form that the child may die, and the psychic reaction\r\nto the dream of wishing death proves that, in spite of all the\r\ndifferences in content, the wish in the case of the child is somehow or\r\nother the same as it is with adults.\r\n\r\nIf now the death-wish of the child towards its brothers and sisters has\r\nbeen explained by the childish egotism, which causes the child to regard\r\nits brothers and sisters as competitors, how may we account for the same\r\nwish towards parents, who bestow love on the child and satisfy its\r\nwants, and whose preservation it ought to desire from these very\r\negotistical motives?\r\n\r\nIn the solution of this difficulty we are aided by the experience that\r\ndreams of the death of parents predominantly refer to that member of the\r\nparental couple which shares the sex of the dreamer, so that the man\r\nmostly dreams of the death of his father, the woman of the death of her\r\nmother. I cannot claim that this happens regularly, but the\r\npredominating occurrence of this dream in the manner indicated is so\r\nevident that it must be explained through some factor that is\r\nuniversally operative. To express the matter boldly, it is as though a\r\nsexual preference becomes active at an early period, as though the boy\r\nregards his father as a rival in love, and as though the girl takes the\r\nsame attitude toward her mother\xe2\x80\x94a rival by getting rid of whom he or she\r\ncannot but profit.\r\n\r\nBefore rejecting this idea as monstrous, let the reader consider the\r\nactual relations between parents and children. What the requirements of\r\nculture and piety demand of this relation must be distinguished from\r\nwhat daily observation shows us to be the fact. More than one cause for\r\nhostile feeling is concealed within the relations between parents and\r\nchildren; the conditions necessary for the actuation of wishes which\r\ncannot exist in the presence of the censor are most abundantly provided.\r\nLet us dwell at first upon the relation between father and son. I\r\nbelieve that the sanctity which we have ascribed to the injunction of\r\nthe decalogue dulls our perception of reality. Perhaps we hardly dare to\r\nnotice that the greater part of humanity neglects to obey the fifth\r\ncommandment. In the lowest as well as in the highest strata of human\r\nsociety, piety towards parents is in the habit of receding before other\r\ninterests. The obscure reports which have come to us in mythology and\r\nlegend from the primeval ages of human society give us an unpleasant\r\nidea of the power of the father and the ruthlessness with which it was\r\nused. Kronos devours his children, as the wild boar devours the brood of\r\nthe sow; Zeus emasculates his father[CB] and takes his place as a ruler.\r\nThe more despotically the father ruled in the ancient family, the more\r\nmust the son have taken the position of an enemy, and the greater must\r\nhave been his impatience, as designated successor, to obtain the mastery\r\nhimself after his father\xe2\x80\x99s death. Even in our own middle-class family\r\nthe father is accustomed to aid the development of the germ of hatred\r\nwhich naturally belongs to the paternal relation by refusing the son the\r\ndisposal of his own destiny, or the means necessary for this. A\r\nphysician often has occasion to notice that the son\xe2\x80\x99s grief at the loss\r\nof his father cannot suppress his satisfaction at the liberty which he\r\nhas at last obtained. Every father frantically holds on to whatever of\r\nthe sadly antiquated _potestas patris_ still remains in the society of\r\nto-day, and every poet who, like Ibsen, puts the ancient strife between\r\nfather and son in the foreground of his fiction is sure of his effect.\r\nThe causes of conflict between mother and daughter arise when the\r\ndaughter grows up and finds a guardian in her mother, while she desires\r\nsexual freedom, and when, on the other hand, the mother has been warned\r\nby the budding beauty of her daughter that the time has come for her to\r\nrenounce sexual claims.\r\n\r\nAll these conditions are notorious and open to everyone\xe2\x80\x99s inspection.\r\nBut they do not serve to explain dreams of the death of parents found in\r\nthe case of persons to whom piety towards their parents has long since\r\ncome to be inviolable. We are furthermore prepared by the preceding\r\ndiscussion to find that the death-wish towards parents is to be\r\nexplained by reference to earliest childhood.\r\n\r\nThis conjecture is reaffirmed with a certainty that makes doubt\r\nimpossible in its application to psychoneurotics through the analyses\r\nthat have been undertaken with them. It is here found that the sexual\r\nwishes of the child\xe2\x80\x94in so far as they deserve this designation in their\r\nembryonic state\xe2\x80\x94awaken at a very early period, and that the first\r\ninclinations of the girl are directed towards the father, and the first\r\nchildish cravings of the boy towards the mother. The father thus becomes\r\nan annoying competitor for the boy, as the mother does for the girl, and\r\nwe have already shown in the case of brothers and sisters how little it\r\ntakes for this feeling to lead the child to the death-wish. Sexual\r\nselection, as a rule, early becomes evident in the parents; it is a\r\nnatural tendency for the father to indulge the little daughter, and for\r\nthe mother to take the part of the sons, while both work earnestly for\r\nthe education of the little ones when the magic of sex does not\r\nprejudice their judgment. The child is very well aware of any\r\npartiality, and resists that member of the parental couple who\r\ndiscourages it. To find love in a grown-up person is for the child not\r\nonly the satisfaction of a particular craving, but also means that the\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s will is to be yielded to in other respects. Thus the child obeys\r\nits own sexual impulse, and at the same time re-enforces the feeling\r\nwhich proceeds from the parents, if it makes a selection among the\r\nparents that corresponds to theirs.\r\n\r\nMost of the signs of these infantile inclinations are usually\r\noverlooked; some of them may be observed even after the first years of\r\nchildhood. An eight-year-old girl of my acquaintance, when her mother is\r\ncalled from the table, takes advantage of the opportunity to proclaim\r\nherself her successor. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I shall be Mamma; Charles, do you want some\r\nmore vegetables? Have some, I beg you,\xe2\x80\x9d &c. A particularly gifted and\r\nvivacious girl, not yet four years old, with whom this bit of child\r\npsychology is unusually transparent, says outright: \xe2\x80\x9cNow mother can go\r\naway; then father must marry me and I shall be his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d Nor does this\r\nwish by any means exclude from child life the possibility that the child\r\nmay love his mother affectionately. If the little boy is allowed to\r\nsleep at his mother\xe2\x80\x99s side whenever his father goes on a journey, and if\r\nafter his father\xe2\x80\x99s return he must go back to the nursery to a person\r\nwhom he likes far less, the wish may be easily actuated that his father\r\nmay always be absent, in order that he may keep his place next to his\r\ndear, beautiful mamma; and the father\xe2\x80\x99s death is obviously a means for\r\nthe attainment of this wish; for the child\xe2\x80\x99s experience has taught him\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cdead\xe2\x80\x9d folks, like grandpa, for example, are always absent; they\r\nnever return.\r\n\r\nAlthough observations upon little children lend themselves, without\r\nbeing forced, to the proposed interpretation, they do not carry the full\r\nconviction which psychoanalyses of adult neurotics obtrude upon the\r\nphysician. The dreams in question are here cited with introductions of\r\nsuch a nature that their interpretation as wish-dreams becomes\r\nunavoidable. One day I find a lady sad and weeping. She says: \xe2\x80\x9cI do not\r\nwant to see my relatives any more; they must shudder at me.\xe2\x80\x9d Thereupon,\r\nalmost without any transition, she tells that she remembers a dream,\r\nwhose significance, of course, she does not know. She dreamed it four\r\nyears before, and it is as follows: _A fox or a lynx is taking a walk on\r\nthe roof; then something falls down, or she falls down, and after that\r\nher mother is carried out of the house dead_\xe2\x80\x94whereat the dreamer cries\r\nbitterly. No sooner had I informed her that this dream must signify a\r\nwish from her childhood to see her mother dead, and that it is because\r\nof this dream that she thinks that her relatives must shudder at her,\r\nthan she furnished some material for explaining the dream. \xe2\x80\x9cLynx-eye\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\nan opprobrious epithet which a street boy once bestowed on her when she\r\nwas a very small child; when she was three years old a brick had fallen\r\non her mother\xe2\x80\x99s head so that she bled severely.\r\n\r\nI once had opportunity to make a thorough study of a young girl who\r\nunderwent several psychic states. In the state of frenzied excitement\r\nwith which the illness started, the patient showed a very strong\r\naversion to her mother; she struck and scolded her as soon as she\r\napproached the bed, while at the same time she remained loving and\r\nobedient to a much older sister. Then there followed a clear but\r\nsomewhat apathetic state with very much disturbed sleep. It was in this\r\nphase that I began to treat her and to analyse her dreams. An enormous\r\nnumber of these dealt in a more or less abstruse manner with the death\r\nof the mother; now she was present at the funeral of an old woman, now\r\nshe saw her sisters sitting at the table dressed in mourning; the\r\nmeaning of the dreams could not be doubted. During the further progress\r\nof the convalescence hysterical phobias appeared; the most torturing of\r\nthese was the idea that something happened to her mother. She was always\r\nhaving to hurry home from wherever she happened to be in order to\r\nconvince herself that her mother was still alive. Now this case, in view\r\nof my other experiences, was very instructive; it showed in polyglot\r\ntranslations, as it were, the different ways in which the psychic\r\napparatus reacts to the same exciting idea. In the state of excitement\r\nwhich I conceive as the overpowering of the second psychic instance, the\r\nunconscious enmity towards the mother became potent as a motor impulse;\r\nthen, after calmness set in, following the suppression of the tumult,\r\nand after the domination of the censor had been restored, this feeling\r\nof enmity had access only to the province of dreams in order to realise\r\nthe wish that the mother might die; and after the normal condition had\r\nbeen still further strengthened, it created the excessive concern for\r\nthe mother as a hysterical counter-reaction and manifestation of\r\ndefence. In the light of these considerations it is no longer\r\ninexplicable why hysterical girls are so often extravagantly attached to\r\ntheir mothers.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion I had opportunity to get a profound insight into the\r\nunconscious psychic life of a young man for whom a compulsion-neurosis\r\nmade life almost unendurable, so that he could not go on the street,\r\nbecause he was harassed by the obsession that he would kill every one he\r\nmet. He spent his days in arranging evidence for an alibi in case he\r\nshould be charged with any murder that might have occurred in the city.\r\nIt is superfluous to remark that this man was as moral as he was highly\r\ncultured. The analysis\xe2\x80\x94which, moreover, led to a cure\xe2\x80\x94discovered\r\nmurderous impulses toward the young man\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat over-strict father as\r\nthe basis of these disagreeable ideas of compulsion\xe2\x80\x94impulses which, to\r\nhis great surprise, had received conscious expression when he was seven\r\nyears old, but which, of course, had originated in much earlier years of\r\nchildhood. After the painful illness and death of the father, the\r\nobsessive reproach transferred to strangers in the form of the\r\nafore-mentioned phobia, appeared when the young man was thirty-one years\r\nold. Anyone capable of wishing to push his own father from a\r\nmountain-top into an abyss is certainly not to be trusted to spare the\r\nlives of those who are not so closely bound to him; he does well to lock\r\nhimself into his room.\r\n\r\nAccording to my experience, which is now large, parents play a leading\r\npart in the infantile psychology of all later neurotics, and falling in\r\nlove with one member of the parental couple and hatred of the other help\r\nto make up that fateful sum of material furnished by the psychic\r\nimpulses, which has been formed during the infantile period, and which\r\nis of such great importance for the symptoms appearing in the later\r\nneurosis. But I do not think that psychoneurotics are here sharply\r\ndistinguished from normal human beings, in that they are capable of\r\ncreating something absolutely new and peculiar to themselves. It is far\r\nmore probable, as is shown also by occasional observation upon normal\r\nchildren, that in their loving or hostile wishes towards their parents\r\npsychoneurotics only show in exaggerated form feelings which are present\r\nless distinctly and less intensely in the minds of most children.\r\nAntiquity has furnished us with legendary material to confirm this fact,\r\nand the deep and universal effectiveness of these legends can only be\r\nexplained by granting a similar universal applicability to the\r\nabove-mentioned assumption in infantile psychology.\r\n\r\nI refer to the legend of King Oedipus and the drama of the same name by\r\nSophocles. Oedipus, the son of Laius, king of Thebes, and of Jocasta, is\r\nexposed while a suckling, because an oracle has informed the father that\r\nhis son, who is still unborn, will be his murderer. He is rescued, and\r\ngrows up as the king\xe2\x80\x99s son at a foreign court, until, being uncertain\r\nabout his origin, he also consults the oracle, and is advised to avoid\r\nhis native place, for he is destined to become the murderer of his\r\nfather and the husband of his mother. On the road leading away from his\r\nsupposed home he meets King Laius and strikes him dead in a sudden\r\nquarrel. Then he comes to the gates of Thebes, where he solves the\r\nriddle of the Sphynx who is barring the way, and he is elected king by\r\nthe Thebans in gratitude, and is presented with the hand of Jocasta. He\r\nreigns in peace and honour for a long time, and begets two sons and two\r\ndaughters upon his unknown mother, until at last a plague breaks out\r\nwhich causes the Thebans to consult the oracle anew. Here Sophocles\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntragedy begins. The messengers bring the advice that the plague will\r\nstop as soon as the murderer of Laius is driven from the country. But\r\nwhere is he hidden?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are they to be found? How shall we trace the perpetrators of so\r\nold a crime where no conjecture leads to discovery?\xe2\x80\x9d[CC]\r\n\r\nThe action of the play now consists merely in a revelation, which is\r\ngradually completed and artfully delayed\xe2\x80\x94resembling the work of a\r\npsychoanalysis\xe2\x80\x94of the fact that Oedipus himself is the murderer of\r\nLaius, and the son of the dead man and of Jocasta. Oedipus, profoundly\r\nshocked at the monstrosities which he has unknowingly committed, blinds\r\nhimself and leaves his native place. The oracle has been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe _Oedipus Tyrannus_ is a so-called tragedy of fate; its tragic effect\r\nis said to be found in the opposition between the powerful will of the\r\ngods and the vain resistance of the human beings who are threatened with\r\ndestruction; resignation to the will of God and confession of one\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nhelplessness is the lesson which the deeply-moved spectator is to learn\r\nfrom the tragedy. Consequently modern authors have tried to obtain a\r\nsimilar tragic effect by embodying the same opposition in a story of\r\ntheir own invention. But spectators have sat unmoved while a curse or an\r\noracular sentence has been fulfilled on blameless human beings in spite\r\nof all their struggles; later tragedies of fate have all remained\r\nwithout effect.\r\n\r\nIf the _Oedipus Tyrannus_ is capable of moving modern men no less than\r\nit moved the contemporary Greeks, the explanation of this fact cannot\r\nlie merely in the assumption that the effect of the Greek tragedy is\r\nbased upon the opposition between fate and human will, but is to be\r\nsought in the peculiar nature of the material by which the opposition is\r\nshown. There must be a voice within us which is prepared to recognise\r\nthe compelling power of fate in _Oedipus_, while we justly condemn the\r\nsituations occurring in _Die Ahnfrau_ or in other tragedies of later\r\ndate as arbitrary inventions. And there must be a factor corresponding\r\nto this inner voice in the story of King Oedipus. His fate moves us only\r\nfor the reason that it might have been ours, for the oracle has put the\r\nsame curse upon us before our birth as upon him. Perhaps we are all\r\ndestined to direct our first sexual impulses towards our mothers, and\r\nour first hatred and violent washes towards our fathers; our dreams\r\nconvince us of it. King Oedipus, who has struck his father Laius dead\r\nand has married his mother Jocasta, is nothing but the realised wish of\r\nour childhood. But more fortunate than he, we have since succeeded,\r\nunless we have become psychoneurotics, in withdrawing our sexual\r\nimpulses from our mothers and in forgetting our jealousy of our fathers.\r\nWe recoil from the person for whom this primitive wish has been\r\nfulfilled with all the force of the repression which these wishes have\r\nsuffered within us. By his analysis, showing us the guilt of Oedipus,\r\nthe poet urges us to recognise our own inner self, in which these\r\nimpulses, even if suppressed, are still present. The comparison with\r\nwhich the chorus leaves us\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9c... Behold! this Oedipus, who unravelled the famous riddle and who\r\n  was a man of eminent virtue; a man who trusted neither to popularity\r\n  nor to the fortune of his citizens; see how great a storm of adversity\r\n  hath at last overtaken him\xe2\x80\x9d (Act v. sc. 4).\r\n\r\nThis warning applies to ourselves and to our pride, to us, who have\r\ngrown so wise and so powerful in our own estimation since the years of\r\nour childhood. Like Oedipus, we live in ignorance of the wishes that\r\noffend morality, wishes which nature has forced upon us, and after the\r\nrevelation of which we want to avert every glance from the scenes of our\r\nchildhood.\r\n\r\nIn the very text of Sophocles\xe2\x80\x99 tragedy there is an unmistakable\r\nreference to the fact that the Oedipus legend originates in an extremely\r\nold dream material, which consists of the painful disturbance of the\r\nrelation towards one\xe2\x80\x99s parents by means of the first impulses of\r\nsexuality. Jocasta comforts Oedipus\xe2\x80\x94who is not yet enlightened, but who\r\nhas become worried on account of the oracle\xe2\x80\x94by mentioning to him the\r\ndream which is dreamt by so many people, though she attaches no\r\nsignificance to it\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cFor it hath already been the lot of many men in dreams to think\r\n  themselves partners of their mother\xe2\x80\x99s bed. But he passes most easily\r\n  through life to whom these circumstances are trifles\xe2\x80\x9d (Act iv. sc. 3).\r\n\r\nThe dream of having sexual intercourse with one\xe2\x80\x99s mother occurred at\r\nthat time, as it does to-day, to many people, who tell it with\r\nindignation and astonishment. As may be understood, it is the key to the\r\ntragedy and the complement to the dream of the death of the father. The\r\nstory of Oedipus is the reaction of the imagination to these two typical\r\ndreams, and just as the dream when occurring to an adult is experienced\r\nwith feelings of resistance, so the legend must contain terror and\r\nself-chastisement. The appearance which it further assumes is the result\r\nof an uncomprehending secondary elaboration which tries to make it serve\r\ntheological purposes (_cf._ the dream material of exhibitionism, p.\r\n206). The attempt to reconcile divine omnipotence with human\r\nresponsibility must, of course, fail with this material as with every\r\nother.[CD]\r\n\r\nI must not leave the typical dream of the death of dear relatives\r\nwithout somewhat further elucidating the subject of their significance\r\nfor the theory of the dream in general. These dreams show us a\r\nrealisation of the very unusual case where the dream thought, which has\r\nbeen created by the repressed wish, completely escapes the censor, and\r\nis transferred to the dream without alteration. There must be present\r\npeculiar conditions making possible such an outcome. I find\r\ncircumstances favourable to these dreams in the two following factors:\r\nFirst, there is no wish which we believe further from us; we believe\r\nsuch a wish \xe2\x80\x9cwould never occur to us in a dream\xe2\x80\x9d; the dream censor is\r\ntherefore not prepared for this monstrosity, just as the legislation of\r\nSolon was incapable of establishing a punishment for patricide.\r\nSecondly, the repressed and unsuspected wish is in just this case\r\nparticularly often met by a fragment of the day\xe2\x80\x99s experience in the\r\nshape of a concern about the life of the beloved person. This concern\r\ncannot be registered in the dream by any other means than by taking\r\nadvantage of the wish that has the same content; but it is possible for\r\nthe wish to mask itself behind the concern which has been awakened\r\nduring the day. If one is inclined to think all this a more simple\r\nprocess, and that one merely continues during the night and in dreams\r\nwhat one has been concerned with during the day, the dream of the death\r\nof beloved persons is removed from all connection with dream\r\nexplanation, and an easily reducible problem is uselessly retained.\r\n\r\nIt is also instructive to trace the relation of these dreams to anxiety\r\ndreams. In the dream of the death of dear persons the repressed wish has\r\nfound a way of avoiding the censor, and the distortion which it causes.\r\nIn this case the inevitable concomitant manifestation is that\r\ndisagreeable sensations are felt in the dream. Thus the dream of fear is\r\nbrought about only when the censor is entirely or partially overpowered,\r\nand, on the other hand, the overpowering of the censor is made easier\r\nwhen fear has already been furnished by somatic sources. Thus it becomes\r\nobvious for what purpose the censor performs its office and practises\r\ndream distortion; it does this _in order to prevent the development of\r\nfear or other forms of disagreeable emotion_.\r\n\r\nI have spoken above of the egotism of the infantile mind, and I may now\r\nresume this subject in order to suggest that dreams preserve this\r\ncharacteristic\xe2\x80\x94thus showing their connection with infantile life. Every\r\ndream is absolutely egotistical; in every dream the beloved ego appears,\r\neven though it may be in a disguised form. The wishes that are realised\r\nin dreams are regularly the wishes of this ego; it is only a deceptive\r\nappearance if interest in another person is thought to have caused the\r\ndream. I shall subject to analysis several examples which appear to\r\ncontradict this assertion.\r\n\r\nI. A boy not yet four years old relates the following: _He saw a large\r\ndish garnished, and upon it a large piece of roast meat, and the meat\r\nwas all of a sudden\xe2\x80\x94not cut to pieces\xe2\x80\x94but eaten up. He did not see the\r\nperson who ate it._[CE]\r\n\r\nWho may this strange person be of whose luxurious repast this little\r\nfellow dreams? The experiences of the day must give us the explanation\r\nof this. For a few days the boy had been living on a diet of milk\r\naccording to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s prescription; but on the evening of the day\r\nbefore the dream he had been naughty, and as a punishment he had been\r\ndeprived of his evening meal. He had already undergone one such\r\nhunger-cure, and had acted very bravely. He knew that he would get\r\nnothing to eat, but he did not dare to indicate by a word that he was\r\nhungry. Education was beginning to have its influence upon him; this is\r\nexpressed even in the dream which shows the beginnings of dream\r\ndisfigurement. There is no doubt that he himself is the person whose\r\nwishes are directed toward this abundant meal, and a meal of roast meat\r\nat that. But since he knows that this is forbidden him, he does not\r\ndare, as children do in the dream (_cf._ the dream about strawberries of\r\nmy little Anna, p. 110), to sit down to the meal himself. The person\r\nremains anonymous.\r\n\r\nII. Once I dream that I see on the show-table of a book store a new\r\nnumber in the Book-lovers\xe2\x80\x99 Collection\xe2\x80\x94the collection which I am in the\r\nhabit of buying (art monographs, monographs on the history of the world,\r\nfamous art centres, &c.). _The new collection is called Famous Orators\r\n(or Orations), and the first number bears the name of Doctor Lecher._\r\n\r\nIn the course of analysis it appears improbable that the fame of Dr.\r\nLecher, the long-winded orator of the German Opposition, should occupy\r\nmy thoughts while I am dreaming. The fact is that, a few days before, I\r\nundertook the psychic cure of some new patients, and was now forced to\r\ntalk for from ten to twelve hours a day. Thus I myself am the\r\nlong-winded orator.\r\n\r\nIII. Upon another occasion I dream that a teacher of my acquaintance at\r\nthe university says: _My son, the Myopic_. Then there follows a dialogue\r\nconsisting of short speeches and replies. A third portion of the dream\r\nfollows in which I and my sons appear, and as far as the latent dream\r\ncontent is concerned, father, son, and Professor M. are alike only lay\r\nfigures to represent me and my eldest son. I shall consider this dream\r\nagain further on because of another peculiarity.\r\n\r\nIV. The following dream gives an example of really base egotistical\r\nfeelings, which are concealed behind affectionate concern:\r\n\r\n_My friend Otto looks ill, his face is brown and his eyes bulge._\r\n\r\nOtto is my family physician, to whom I owe a debt greater than I can\r\never hope to repay, since he has guarded the health of my children for\r\nyears. He has treated them successfully when they were taken sick, and\r\nbesides that he has given them presents on all occasions which gave him\r\nany excuse for doing so. He came for a visit on the day of the dream,\r\nand my wife noticed that he looked tired and exhausted. Then comes my\r\ndream at night, and attributes to him a few of the symptoms of Basedow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisease. Any one disregarding my rules for dream interpretation would\r\nunderstand this dream to mean that I am concerned about the health of my\r\nfriend, and that this concern is realised in the dream. It would thus be\r\na contradiction not only of the assertion that the dream is a\r\nwish-fulfilment, but also of the assertion that it is accessible only to\r\negotistic impulses. But let the person who interprets the dream in this\r\nmanner explain to me why I fear that Otto has Basedow\xe2\x80\x99s disease, for\r\nwhich diagnosis his appearance does not give the slightest\r\njustification? As opposed to this, my analysis furnishes the following\r\nmaterial, taken from an occurrence which happened six years ago. A small\r\nparty of us, including Professor R., were driving in profound darkness\r\nthrough the forest of N., which is several hours distant from our\r\ncountry home. The coachman, who was not quite sober, threw us and the\r\nwagon down a bank, and it was only by a lucky accident that we all\r\nescaped unhurt. But we were forced to spend the night at the nearest\r\ninn, where the news of our accident awakened great sympathy. A\r\ngentleman, who showed unmistakable signs of the morbus Basedowii\xe2\x80\x94nothing\r\nbut a brownish colour of the skin of the face and bulging eyes, no\r\ngoitre\xe2\x80\x94placed himself entirely at our disposal and asked what he could\r\ndo for us. Professor R. answered in his decided way: \xe2\x80\x9cNothing but lend\r\nme a night-shirt.\xe2\x80\x9d Whereupon our generous friend replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry\r\nbut I cannot do that,\xe2\x80\x9d and went away.\r\n\r\nIn continuing the analysis, it occurs to me that Basedow is the name not\r\nonly of a physician, but also of a famous educator. (Now that I am awake\r\nI do not feel quite sure of this fact.) My friend Otto is the person\r\nwhom I have asked to take charge of the physical education of my\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x94especially during the age of puberty (hence the night-shirt)\xe2\x80\x94in\r\ncase anything should happen to me. By seeing Otto in the dream with the\r\nmorbid symptoms of our above-mentioned generous benefactor, I apparently\r\nmean to say, \xe2\x80\x9cIf anything happens to me, just as little is to be\r\nexpected for my children from him as was to be expected then from Baron\r\nL., in spite of his well-meaning offers.\xe2\x80\x9d The egotistical turn of this\r\ndream ought now to be clear.[CF]\r\n\r\nBut where is the wish-fulfilment to be found? It is not in the vengeance\r\nsecured upon my friend Otto, whose fate it seems to be to receive\r\nill-treatment in my dreams, but in the following circumstances: In\r\nrepresenting Otto in the dream as Baron L., I have at the same time\r\nidentified myself with some one else, that is to say, with Professor R.,\r\nfor I have asked something of Otto, just as R. asked something of Baron\r\nL. at the time of the occurrence which has been mentioned. And that is\r\nthe point. For Professor R. has pursued his way independently outside\r\nthe schools, somewhat as I have done, and has only in later years\r\nreceived the title which he earned long ago. I am therefore again\r\nwishing to be a professor! The very phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin later years\xe2\x80\x9d is the\r\nfulfilment of wish, for it signifies that I shall live long enough to\r\npilot my boy through the age of puberty myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nI gave only a brief account of the other forms of typical dreams in the\r\nfirst edition of this book, because an insufficient amount of good\r\nmaterial was at my disposal. My experience, which has since been\r\nincreased, now makes it possible for me to divide these dreams into two\r\nbroad classes\xe2\x80\x94first, those which really have the same meaning every\r\ntime, and secondly, those which must be subjected to the most widely\r\ndifferent interpretations in spite of their identical or similar\r\ncontent. Among the typical dreams of the first sort I shall closely\r\nconsider the examination dream and the so-called dream of dental\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has received his degree after having passed the final\r\ncollege examination, complains of the ruthlessness with which he is\r\npursued by the anxiety dream that he will fail, that he must repeat his\r\nwork, &c. For the holder of the university degree this typical dream is\r\nreplaced by another, which represents to him that he has to pass the\r\nexamination for the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s degree, and against which he vainly raises\r\nthe objection in his sleep that he has already been practising for\r\nyears\xe2\x80\x94that he is already a university instructor or the head of a law\r\nfirm. These are the ineradicable memories of the punishments which we\r\nsuffered when we were children for misdeeds which we had\r\ncommitted\xe2\x80\x94memories which were revived in us on that _dies irae, dies\r\nilla_ of the severe examination at the two critical junctures in our\r\nstudies. The \xe2\x80\x9cexamination-phobia\xe2\x80\x9d of neurotics is also strengthened by\r\nthis childish fear. After we have ceased to be schoolboys it is no\r\nlonger our parents and guardians as at first, or our teachers as later\r\non, who see to our punishment; the inexorable chain of causes and\r\neffects in life has taken over our further education. Now we dream of\r\nexaminations for graduation or for the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s degree\xe2\x80\x94and who has not\r\nbeen faint-hearted in these tests, even though he belonged to the\r\nrighteous?\xe2\x80\x94whenever we fear that an outcome will punish us because we\r\nhave not done something, or because we have not accomplished something\r\nas we should\xe2\x80\x94in short whenever we feel the weight of responsibility.\r\n\r\nI owe the actual explanation of examination dreams to a remark made by a\r\nwell-informed colleague, who once asserted in a scientific discussion\r\nthat in his experience the examination dream occurs only to persons who\r\nhave passed the examination, never to those who have gone to pieces on\r\nit. The anxiety dream of the examination, which occurs, as is being more\r\nand more corroborated, when the dreamer is looking forward to a\r\nresponsible action on his part the next day and the possibility of\r\ndisgrace, has therefore probably selected an occasion in the past where\r\nthe great anxiety has shown itself to have been without justification\r\nand has been contradicted by the result. This would be a very striking\r\nexample of a misconception of the dream content on the part of the\r\nwaking instance. The objection to the dream, which is conceived as the\r\nindignant protest, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am already a doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d &c., would be in reality\r\na consolation which the dreams offer, and which would therefore be to\r\nthe following effect: \xe2\x80\x9cDo not be afraid of the morrow; think of the fear\r\nwhich you had before the final examination, and yet nothing came of it.\r\nYou are a doctor this minute,\xe2\x80\x9d &c. The fear, however, which we attribute\r\nto the dream, originates in the remnants of daily experience.\r\n\r\nThe tests of this explanation which I was able to make in my own case\r\nand in that of others, although they were not sufficiently numerous,\r\nhave been altogether successful. I failed, for example, in the\r\nexamination for the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s degree in legal medicine; never once have I\r\nbeen concerned about this matter in my dreams, while I have often enough\r\nbeen examined in botany, zoology, or chemistry, in which subjects I took\r\nthe examinations with well-founded anxiety, but escaped punishment\r\nthrough the clemency of fortune or of the examiner. In my dreams of\r\ncollege examination, I am regularly examined in history, a subject which\r\nI passed brilliantly at the time, but only, I must admit, because my\r\ngood-natured professor\xe2\x80\x94my one-eyed benefactor in another dream (_cf._ p.\r\n12)\xe2\x80\x94did not overlook the fact that on the list of questions I had\r\ncrossed out the second of three questions as an indication that he\r\nshould not insist on it. One of my patients, who withdrew before the\r\nfinal college examinations and made them up later, but who failed in the\r\nofficer\xe2\x80\x99s examination and did not become an officer, tells me that he\r\ndreams about the former examination often enough, but never about the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned colleague (Dr. Stekel of Vienna) calls attention to\r\nthe double meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9cMatura\xe2\x80\x9d (_Matura_\xe2\x80\x94examination for\r\ncollege degree: mature, ripe), and claims that he has observed that\r\nexamination dreams occur very frequently when a sexual test is set for\r\nthe following day, in which, therefore, the disgrace which is feared\r\nmight consist in the manifestation of slight potency. A German colleague\r\ntakes exception to this, as it appears, justly, on the ground that this\r\nexamination is denominated in Germany the Abiturium and hence lacks this\r\ndouble meaning.\r\n\r\nOn account of their similar affective impression dreams of missing a\r\ntrain deserve to be placed next to examination dreams. Their explanation\r\nalso justifies this relationship. They are consolation dreams directed\r\nagainst another feeling of fear perceived in the dream, the fear of\r\ndying. \xe2\x80\x9cTo depart\xe2\x80\x9d is one of the most frequent and one of the most\r\neasily reached symbols of death. The dream thus says consolingly:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompose yourself, you are not going to die (to depart),\xe2\x80\x9d just as the\r\nexamination dream calms us by saying \xe2\x80\x9cFear not, nothing will happen to\r\nyou even this time.\xe2\x80\x9d The difficulty in understanding both kinds of\r\ndreams is due to the fact that the feeling of anxiety is directly\r\nconnected with the expression of consolation. Stekel treats fully the\r\nsymbolisms of death in his recently published book _Die Sprache des\r\nTraumes_.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the \xe2\x80\x9cdreams of dental irritation,\xe2\x80\x9d which I have had to\r\nanalyse often enough with my patients, escaped me for a long time,\r\nbecause, much to my astonishment, resistances that were altogether too\r\ngreat obstructed their interpretation.\r\n\r\nAt last overwhelming evidence convinced me that, in the case of men,\r\nnothing else than cravings for masturbation from the time of puberty\r\nfurnishes the motive power for these dreams. I shall analyse two such\r\ndreams, one of which is likewise \xe2\x80\x9ca dream of flight.\xe2\x80\x9d The two dreams are\r\nof the same person\xe2\x80\x94a young man with a strong homosexuality, which,\r\nhowever, has been repressed in life.\r\n\r\n_He is witnessing a performance of_ Fidelio _from the parquette of the\r\nopera house; he is sitting next to L., whose personality is congenial to\r\nhim, and whose friendship he would like to have. He suddenly flies\r\ndiagonally clear across the parquette; he then puts his hand in his\r\nmouth and draws out two of his teeth._\r\n\r\nHe himself describes the flight by saying it was as if he were \xe2\x80\x9cthrown\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninto the air. As it was a performance of _Fidelio_ he recalls the poet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n                  \xe2\x80\x9cHe who a charming wife acquired\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut even the acquisition of a charming wife is not among the wishes of\r\nthe dreamer. Two other verses would be more appropriate:\r\n\r\n              _\xe2\x80\x9cHe who succeeds in the lucky (big) throw,\r\n               A friend of a friend to be....\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nThe dream thus contains the \xe2\x80\x9clucky (big) throw,\xe2\x80\x9d which is not, however,\r\na wish-fulfilment only. It also conceals the painful reflection that in\r\nhis striving after friendship he has often had the misfortune to be\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthrown down,\xe2\x80\x9d and the fear lest this fate may be repeated in the case\r\nof the young man next whom he has enjoyed the performance of _Fidelio_.\r\nThis is now followed by a confession which quite puts this refined\r\ndreamer to shame, to the effect that once, after such a rejection on the\r\npart of a friend, out of burning desire he merged into sexual excitement\r\nand masturbated twice in succession.\r\n\r\nThe other dream is as follows: _Two professors of the university who are\r\nknown to him are treating him in my stead. One of them does something\r\nwith his penis; he fears an operation. The other one thrusts an iron bar\r\nat his mouth so that he loses two teeth. He is bound with four silken\r\ncloths._\r\n\r\nThe sexual significance of this dream can hardly be doubted. The silken\r\ncloths are equivalent to an identification with a homosexual of his\r\nacquaintance. The dreamer, who has never achieved coition, but who has\r\nnever actually sought sexual intercourse with men, conceives sexual\r\nintercourse after the model of the masturbation which he was once taught\r\nduring the time of puberty.\r\n\r\nI believe that the frequent modifications of the typical dream of dental\r\nirritation\xe2\x80\x94that, for example, of another person drawing the tooth from\r\nthe dreamer\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, are made intelligible by means of the same\r\nexplanation. It may, however, be difficult to see how \xe2\x80\x9cdental\r\nirritation\xe2\x80\x9d can come to have this significance. I may then call\r\nattention to a transference from below to above which occurs very\r\nfrequently. This transference is at the service of sexual repression,\r\nand by means of it all kinds of sensations and intentions occurring in\r\nhysteria which ought to be enacted in the genitals can be realised upon\r\nless objectionable parts of the body. It is also a case of such\r\ntransference when the genitals are replaced by the face in the symbolism\r\nof unconscious thought. This is assisted by the fact that the buttocks\r\nresemble the cheeks, and also by the usage of language which calls the\r\nnymph\xc3\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9clips,\xe2\x80\x9d as resembling those that enclose the opening of the\r\nmouth. The nose is compared to the penis in numerous allusions, and in\r\none place as in the other the presence of hair completes the\r\nresemblance. Only one part of the anatomy\xe2\x80\x94the teeth\xe2\x80\x94are beyond all\r\npossibility of being compared with anything, and it is just this\r\ncoincidence of agreement and disagreement which makes the teeth suitable\r\nfor representation under pressure of sexual repression.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to claim that the interpretation of the dream of dental\r\nirritation as a dream of masturbation, the justification of which I\r\ncannot doubt, has been freed of all obscurity.[CG] I carry the\r\nexplanation as far as I am able, and must leave the rest unsolved. But I\r\nmust also refer to another connection revealed by an idiomatic\r\nexpression. In our country there is in use an indelicate designation for\r\nthe act of masturbation, namely: To pull one out, or to pull one\r\ndown.[CH] I am unable to say whence these colloquialisms originate, and\r\non what symbolisms they are based, but the teeth would well fit in with\r\nthe first of the two.[CI]\r\n\r\nDreams in which one is flying or hovering, falling, swimming, or the\r\nlike, belong to the second group of typical dreams. What do these dreams\r\nsignify? A general statement on this point cannot be made. They signify\r\nsomething different in each case, as we shall hear: only the sensational\r\nmaterial which they contain always comes from the same source.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to conclude, from the material obtained in\r\npsychoanalysis, that these dreams repeat impressions from childhood\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nis, that they refer to the movement games which have such extraordinary\r\nattractions for the child. What uncle has never made a child fly by\r\nrunning across the room with it with arms outstretched, or has never\r\nplayed falling with it by rocking it on his knee and then suddenly\r\nstretching out his leg, or by lifting it up high and then pretending to\r\nwithdraw support. At this the children shout with joy, and demand more\r\nuntiringly, especially if there is a little fright and dizziness\r\nattached to it; in after years they create a repetition of this in the\r\ndream, but in the dream they omit the hands which have held them, so\r\nthat they now freely float and fall. The fondness of all small children\r\nfor games like rocking and see-sawing is well known; and if they see\r\ngymnastic tricks at the circus their recollection of this rocking is\r\nrefreshed. With some boys the hysterical attack consists simply in the\r\nreproduction of such tricks, which they accomplish with great skill. Not\r\ninfrequently sexual sensations are excited by these movement games,\r\nharmless as they are in themselves.[CJ] To express the idea by a word\r\nwhich is current among us, and which covers all of these matters: It is\r\nthe wild playing (\xe2\x80\x9cHetzen\xe2\x80\x9d) of childhood which dreams about flying,\r\nfalling, vertigo, and the like repeat, and the voluptuous feelings of\r\nwhich have now been turned into fear. But as every mother knows, the\r\nwild playing of children has often enough culminated in quarrelling and\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nI therefore have good reason for rejecting the explanation that the\r\ncondition of our dermal sensations during sleep, the sensations caused\r\nby the movements of the lungs, and the like, give rise to dreams of\r\nflying and falling. I see that these very sensations have been\r\nreproduced from the memory with which the dream is concerned\xe2\x80\x94that they\r\nare, therefore, a part of the dream content and not of the dream\r\nsources.\r\n\r\nThis material, similar in its character and origin consisting of\r\nsensations of motion, is now used for the representation of the most\r\nmanifold dream thoughts. Dreams of flying, for the most part\r\ncharacterised by delight, require the most widely different\r\ninterpretations\xe2\x80\x94altogether special interpretations in the case of some\r\npersons, and even interpretations of a typical nature in that of others.\r\nOne of my patients was in the habit of dreaming very often that she was\r\nsuspended above the street at a certain height, without touching the\r\nground. She had grown only to a very small stature, and shunned every\r\nkind of contamination which accompanies intercourse with human beings.\r\nHer dream of suspension fulfilled both of her wishes, by raising her\r\nfeet from the ground and by allowing her head to tower in the upper\r\nregions. In the case of other female dreamers the dream of flying had\r\nthe significance of a longing: If I were a little bird; others thus\r\nbecome angels at night because they have missed being called that by\r\nday. The intimate connection between flying and the idea of a bird makes\r\nit comprehensible that the dream of flying in the case of men usually\r\nhas a significance of coarse sensuality.[CK] We shall also not be\r\nsurprised to hear that this or that dreamer is always very proud of his\r\nability to fly.\r\n\r\nDr. Paul Federn (Vienna) has propounded the fascinating theory that a\r\ngreat many flying dreams are erection dreams, since the remarkable\r\nphenomena of erection which so constantly occupy the human phantasy must\r\nstrongly impress upon it a notion of the suspension of gravity (_cf._\r\nthe winged phalli of the ancients).\r\n\r\nDreams of falling are most frequently characterised by fear. Their\r\ninterpretation, when they occur in women, is subject to no difficulty\r\nbecause women always accept the symbolic sense of falling, which is a\r\ncircumlocution for the indulgence of an erotic temptation. We have not\r\nyet exhausted the infantile sources of the dream of falling; nearly all\r\nchildren have fallen occasionally, and then been picked up and fondled;\r\nif they fell out of bed at night, they were picked up by their nurse and\r\ntaken into her bed.\r\n\r\nPeople who dream often of swimming, of cleaving the waves, with great\r\nenjoyment, &c., have usually been persons who wetted their beds, and\r\nthey now repeat in the dream a pleasure which they have long since\r\nlearned to forgo. We shall soon learn from one example or another to\r\nwhat representation the dreams of swimming easily lend themselves.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of dreams about fire justifies a prohibition of the\r\nnursery which forbids children to burn matches in order that they may\r\nnot wet the bed at night. They too are based on the reminiscence of\r\n_enuresis nocturnus_ of childhood. In the _Bruchst\xc3\xbcck einer\r\nHysterieanalyse_, 1905,[CL] I have given the complete analysis and\r\nsynthesis of such a fire-dream in connection with the infantile history\r\nof the dreamer, and have shown to the representation of what emotions\r\nthis infantile material has been utilised in maturer years.\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to cite a considerable number of other \xe2\x80\x9ctypical\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndreams, if these are understood to refer to the frequent recurrence of\r\nthe same manifest dream content in the case of different dreamers, as,\r\nfor example: dreams of passing through narrow alleys, of walking through\r\na whole suite of rooms; dreams of the nocturnal burglar against whom\r\nnervous people direct precautionary measures before going to sleep;\r\ndreams of being chased by wild animals (bulls, horses), or of being\r\nthreatened with knives, daggers, and lances. The last two are\r\ncharacteristic as the manifest dream content of persons suffering from\r\nanxiety, &c. An investigation dealing especially with this material\r\nwould be well worth while. In lieu of this I have two remarks to offer,\r\nwhich, however, do not apply exclusively to typical dreams.\r\n\r\nI. The more one is occupied with the solution of dreams, the more\r\nwilling one must become to acknowledge that the majority of the dreams\r\nof adults treat of sexual material and give expression to erotic wishes.\r\nOnly one who really analyses dreams, that is to say, who pushes forward\r\nfrom their manifest content to the latent dream thoughts, can form an\r\nopinion on this subject\xe2\x80\x94never the person who is satisfied with\r\nregistering the manifest content (as, for example, N\xc3\xa4cke in his works on\r\nsexual dreams). Let us recognise at once that this fact is not to be\r\nwondered at, but that it is in complete harmony with the fundamental\r\nassumptions of dream explanation. No other impulse has had to undergo so\r\nmuch suppression from the time of childhood as the sex impulse in its\r\nnumerous components,[CM] from no other impulse have survived so many and\r\nsuch intense unconscious wishes, which now act in the sleeping state in\r\nsuch a manner as to produce dreams. In dream interpretation, this\r\nsignificance of sexual complexes must never be forgotten, nor must they,\r\nof course, be exaggerated to the point of being considered exclusive.\r\n\r\nOf many dreams it can be ascertained by a careful interpretation that\r\nthey are even to be taken bisexually, inasmuch as they result in an\r\nirrefutable secondary interpretation in which they realise homosexual\r\nfeelings\xe2\x80\x94that is, feelings that are common to the normal sexual activity\r\nof the dreaming person. But that all dreams are to be interpreted\r\nbisexually, as maintained by W. Stekel,[CN] and Alf. Adler,[CO] seems to\r\nme to be a generalisation as indemonstrable as it is improbable, which I\r\nshould not like to support. Above all I should not know how to dispose\r\nof the apparent fact that there are many dreams satisfying other than\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthe widest sense\xe2\x80\x94erotic needs, as dreams of hunger, thirst, convenience,\r\n&c. Likewise the similar assertions \xe2\x80\x9cthat behind every dream one finds\r\nthe death sentence\xe2\x80\x9d (Stekel), and that every dream shows \xe2\x80\x9ca continuation\r\nfrom the feminine to the masculine line\xe2\x80\x9d (Adler), seem to me to proceed\r\nfar beyond what is admissible in the interpretation of dreams.\r\n\r\nWe have already asserted elsewhere that dreams which are conspicuously\r\ninnocent invariably embody coarse erotic wishes, and we might confirm\r\nthis by means of numerous fresh examples. But many dreams which appear\r\nindifferent, and which would never be suspected of any particular\r\nsignificance, can be traced back, after analysis, to unmistakably sexual\r\nwish-feelings, which are often of an unexpected nature. For example, who\r\nwould suspect a sexual wish in the following dream until the\r\ninterpretation had been worked out? The dreamer relates: _Between two\r\nstately palaces stands a little house, receding somewhat, whose doors\r\nare closed. My wife leads me a little way along the street up to the\r\nlittle house, and pushes in the door, and then I slip quickly and easily\r\ninto the interior of a courtyard that slants obliquely upwards._\r\n\r\nAnyone who has had experience in the translating of dreams will, of\r\ncourse, immediately perceive that penetrating into narrow spaces, and\r\nopening locked doors, belong to the commonest sexual symbolism, and will\r\neasily find in this dream a representation of attempted coition from\r\nbehind (between the two stately buttocks of the female body). The narrow\r\nslanting passage is of course the vagina; the assistance attributed to\r\nthe wife of the dreamer requires the interpretation that in reality it\r\nis only consideration for the wife which is responsible for the\r\ndetention from such an attempt. Moreover, inquiry shows that on the\r\nprevious day a young girl had entered the household of the dreamer who\r\nhad pleased him, and who had given him the impression that she would not\r\nbe altogether opposed to an approach of this sort. The little house\r\nbetween the two palaces is taken from a reminiscence of the Hradschin in\r\nPrague, and thus points again to the girl who is a native of that city.\r\n\r\nIf with my patients I emphasise the frequency of the Oedipus dream\xe2\x80\x94of\r\nhaving sexual intercourse with one\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x94I get the answer: \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot\r\nremember such a dream.\xe2\x80\x9d Immediately afterwards, however, there arises\r\nthe recollection of another disguised and indifferent dream, which has\r\nbeen dreamed repeatedly by the patient, and the analysis shows it to be\r\na dream of this same content\xe2\x80\x94that is, another Oedipus dream. I can\r\nassure the reader that veiled dreams of sexual intercourse with the\r\nmother are a great deal more frequent than open ones to the same\r\neffect.[CP]\r\n\r\nThere are dreams about landscapes and localities in which emphasis is\r\nalways laid upon the assurance: \xe2\x80\x9cI have been there before.\xe2\x80\x9d In this case\r\nthe locality is always the genital organ of the mother; it can indeed be\r\nasserted with such certainty of no other locality that one \xe2\x80\x9chas been\r\nthere before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA large number of dreams, often full of fear, which are concerned with\r\npassing through narrow spaces or with staying in the water, are based\r\nupon fancies about the embryonic life, about the sojourn in the mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwomb, and about the act of birth. The following is the dream of a young\r\nman who in his fancy has already while in embryo taken advantage of his\r\nopportunity to spy upon an act of coition between his parents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_He is in a deep shaft, in which there is a window, as in the Semmering\r\nTunnel. At first he sees an empty landscape through this window, and\r\nthen he composes a picture into it, which is immediately at hand and\r\nwhich fills out the empty space. The picture represents a field which is\r\nbeing thoroughly harrowed by an implement, and the delightful air, the\r\naccompanying idea of hard work, and the bluish-black clods of earth make\r\na pleasant impression. He then goes on and sees a primary school\r\nopened ... and he is surprised that so much attention is devoted in it\r\nto the sexual feelings of the child, which makes him think of me._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere is a pretty water-dream of a female patient, which was turned to\r\nextraordinary account in the course of treatment.\r\n\r\n_At her summer resort at the ... Lake, she hurls herself into the dark\r\nwater at a place where the pale moon is reflected in the water._\r\n\r\nDreams of this sort are parturition dreams; their interpretation is\r\naccomplished by reversing the fact reported in the manifest dream\r\ncontent; thus, instead of \xe2\x80\x9cthrowing one\xe2\x80\x99s self into the water,\xe2\x80\x9d read\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccoming out of the water,\xe2\x80\x9d that is, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing born.\xe2\x80\x9d The place from which\r\none is born is recognised if one thinks of the bad sense of the French\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cla lune.\xe2\x80\x9d The pale moon thus becomes the white \xe2\x80\x9cbottom\xe2\x80\x9d (Popo), which\r\nthe child soon recognises as the place from which it came. Now what can\r\nbe the meaning of the patient\xe2\x80\x99s wishing to be born at her summer resort?\r\nI asked the dreamer this, and she answered without hesitation: \xe2\x80\x9cHasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthe treatment made me as though I were born again?\xe2\x80\x9d Thus the dream\r\nbecomes an invitation to continue the cure at this summer resort, that\r\nis, to visit her there; perhaps it also contains a very bashful allusion\r\nto the wish to become a mother herself.[CQ]\r\n\r\nAnother dream of parturition, with its interpretation, I take from the\r\nwork of E. Jones.[95] \xe2\x80\x9c_She stood at the seashore watching a small boy,\r\nwho seemed to be hers, wading into the water. This he did till the water\r\ncovered him, and she could only see his head bobbing up and down near\r\nthe surface. The scene then changed to the crowded hall of a hotel. Her\r\nhusband left her, and she \xe2\x80\x98entered into conversation with\xe2\x80\x99 a stranger._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe second half of the dream was discovered in the analysis to represent\r\na flight from her husband, and the entering into intimate relations with\r\na third person, behind whom was plainly indicated Mr. X.\xe2\x80\x99s brother\r\nmentioned in a former dream. The first part of the dream was a fairly\r\nevident birth phantasy. In dreams as in mythology, the delivery of a\r\nchild _from_ the uterine waters is commonly presented by distortion as\r\nthe entry of the child _into_ water; among many others, the births of\r\nAdonis, Osiris, Moses, and Bacchus are well-known illustrations of this.\r\nThe bobbing up and down of the head in the water at once recalled to the\r\npatient the sensation of quickening she had experienced in her only\r\npregnancy. Thinking of the boy going into the water induced a reverie in\r\nwhich she saw herself taking him out of the water, carrying him into the\r\nnursery, washing him and dressing him, and installing him in her\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the dream, therefore, represents thoughts concerning\r\nthe elopement, which belonged to the first half of the underlying latent\r\ncontent; the first half of the dream corresponded with the second half\r\nof the latent content, the birth phantasy. Besides this inversion in\r\norder, further inversions took place in each half of the dream. In the\r\nfirst half the child _entered_ the water, and then his head bobbed; in\r\nthe underlying dream thoughts first the quickening occurred, and then\r\nthe child left the water (a double inversion). In the second half her\r\nhusband left her; in the dream thoughts she left her husband.\r\n\r\nAnother parturition dream is related by Abraham[79] of a young woman\r\nlooking forward to her first confinement (p. 22): From a place in the\r\nfloor of the house a subterranean canal leads directly into the water\r\n(parturition path, amniotic liquor). She lifts up a trap in the floor,\r\nand there immediately appears a creature dressed in a brownish fur,\r\nwhich almost resembles a seal. This creature changes into the younger\r\nbrother of the dreamer, to whom she has always stood in maternal\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\nDreams of \xe2\x80\x9csaving\xe2\x80\x9d are connected with parturition dreams. To save,\r\nespecially to save from the water, is equivalent to giving birth when\r\ndreamed by a woman; this sense is, however, modified when the dreamer is\r\na man.[CR]\r\n\r\nRobbers, burglars at night, and ghosts, of which we are afraid before\r\ngoing to bed, and which occasionally even disturb our sleep, originate\r\nin one and the same childish reminiscence. They are the nightly visitors\r\nwho have awakened the child to set it on the chamber so that it may not\r\nwet the bed, or have lifted the cover in order to see clearly how the\r\nchild is holding its hands while sleeping. I have been able to induce an\r\nexact recollection of the nocturnal visitor in the analysis of some of\r\nthese anxiety dreams. The robbers were always the father, the ghosts\r\nmore probably corresponded to feminine persons with white night-gowns.\r\n\r\nII. When one has become familiar with the abundant use of symbolism for\r\nthe representation of sexual material in dreams, one naturally raises\r\nthe question whether there are not many of these symbols which appear\r\nonce and for all with a firmly established significance like the signs\r\nin stenography; and one is tempted to compile a new dream-book according\r\nto the cipher method. In this connection it may be remarked that this\r\nsymbolism does not belong peculiarly to the dream, but rather to\r\nunconscious thinking, particularly that of the masses, and it is to be\r\nfound in greater perfection in the folk-lore, in the myths, legends, and\r\nmanners of speech, in the proverbial sayings, and in the current\r\nwitticisms of a nation than in its dreams.[CS]\r\n\r\nThe dream takes advantage of this symbolism in order to give a disguised\r\nrepresentation to its latent thoughts. Among the symbols which are used\r\nin this manner there are of course many which regularly, or almost\r\nregularly, mean the same thing. Only it is necessary to keep in mind the\r\ncurious plasticity of psychic material. Now and then a symbol in the\r\ndream content may have to be interpreted not symbolically, but according\r\nto its real meaning; at another time the dreamer, owing to a peculiar\r\nset of recollections, may create for himself the right to use anything\r\nwhatever as a sexual symbol, though it is not ordinarily used in that\r\nway. Nor are the most frequently used sexual symbols unambiguous every\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAfter these limitations and reservations I may call attention to the\r\nfollowing: Emperor and Empress (King and Queen) in most cases really\r\nrepresent the parents of the dreamer;[CT] the dreamer himself or herself\r\nis the prince or princess. All elongated objects, sticks, tree-trunks,\r\nand umbrellas (on account of the stretching-up which might be compared\r\nto an erection), all elongated and sharp weapons, knives, daggers, and\r\npikes, are intended to represent the male member. A frequent, not very\r\nintelligible, symbol for the same is a nail-file (on account of the\r\nrubbing and scraping?). Little cases, boxes, caskets, closets, and\r\nstoves correspond to the female part. The symbolism of lock and key has\r\nbeen very gracefully employed by Uhland in his song about the \xe2\x80\x9cGrafen\r\nEberstein,\xe2\x80\x9d to make a common smutty joke. The dream of walking through a\r\nrow of rooms is a brothel or harem dream. Staircases, ladders, and\r\nflights of stairs, or climbing on these, either upwards or downwards,\r\nare symbolic representations of the sexual act.[CU] Smooth walls over\r\nwhich one is climbing, fa\xc3\xa7ades of houses upon which one is letting\r\noneself down, frequently under great anxiety, correspond to the erect\r\nhuman body, and probably repeat in the dream reminiscences of the upward\r\nclimbing of little children on their parents or foster parents. \xe2\x80\x9cSmooth\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwalls are men. Often in a dream of anxiety one is holding on firmly to\r\nsome projection from a house. Tables, set tables, and boards are women,\r\nperhaps on account of the opposition which does away with the bodily\r\ncontours. Since \xe2\x80\x9cbed and board\xe2\x80\x9d (_mensa et thorus_) constitute marriage,\r\nthe former are often put for the latter in the dream, and as far as\r\npracticable the sexual presentation complex is transposed to the eating\r\ncomplex. Of articles of dress the woman\xe2\x80\x99s hat may frequently be\r\ndefinitely interpreted as the male genital. In dreams of men one often\r\nfinds the cravat as a symbol for the penis; this indeed is not only\r\nbecause cravats hang down long, and are characteristic of the man, but\r\nalso because one can select them at pleasure, a freedom which is\r\nprohibited by nature in the original of the symbol. Persons who make use\r\nof this symbol in the dream are very extravagant with cravats, and\r\npossess regular collections of them.[CV] All complicated machines and\r\napparatus in dream are very probably genitals, in the description of\r\nwhich dream symbolism shows itself to be as tireless as the activity of\r\nwit. Likewise many landscapes in dreams, especially with bridges or with\r\nwooded mountains, can be readily recognised as descriptions of the\r\ngenitals. Finally where one finds incomprehensible neologisms one may\r\nthink of combinations made up of components having a sexual\r\nsignificance. Children also in the dream often signify the genitals, as\r\nmen and women are in the habit of fondly referring to their genital\r\norgan as their \xe2\x80\x9clittle one.\xe2\x80\x9d As a very recent symbol of the male genital\r\nmay be mentioned the flying machine, utilisation of which is justified\r\nby its relation to flying as well as occasionally by its form. To play\r\nwith a little child or to beat a little one is often the dream\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrepresentation of onanism. A number of other symbols, in part not\r\nsufficiently verified, are given by Stekel,[114] who illustrates them\r\nwith examples. Right and left, according to him, are to be conceived in\r\nthe dream in an ethical sense. \xe2\x80\x9cThe right way always signifies the road\r\nto righteousness, the left the one to crime. Thus the left may signify\r\nhomosexuality, incest, and perversion, while the right signifies\r\nmarriage, relations with a prostitute, &c. The meaning is always\r\ndetermined by the individual moral viewpoint of the dreamer\xe2\x80\x9d (_l.c._, p.\r\n466). Relatives in the dream generally play the r\xc3\xb4le of genitals (p.\r\n473). Not to be able to catch up with a wagon is interpreted by Stekel\r\nas regret not to be able to come up to a difference in age (p. 479).\r\nBaggage with which one travels is the burden of sin by which one is\r\noppressed (_ibid._). Also numbers, which frequently occur in the dream,\r\nare assigned by Stekel a fixed symbolical meaning, but these\r\ninterpretations seem neither sufficiently verified nor of general\r\nvalidity, although the interpretation in individual cases can generally\r\nbe recognised as probable. In a recently published book by W. Stekel,\r\n_Die Sprache des Traumes_, which I was unable to utilise, there is a\r\nlist (p. 72) of the most common sexual symbols, the object of which is\r\nto prove that all sexual symbols can be bisexually used. He states: \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nthere a symbol which (if in any way permitted by the phantasy) may not\r\nbe used simultaneously in the masculine and the feminine sense!\xe2\x80\x9d To be\r\nsure the clause in parentheses takes away much of the absoluteness of\r\nthis assertion, for this is not at all permitted by the phantasy. I do\r\nnot, however, think it superfluous to state that in my experience\r\nStekel\xe2\x80\x99s general statement has to give way to the recognition of a\r\ngreater manifoldness. Besides those symbols, which are just as frequent\r\nfor the male as for the female genitals, there are others which\r\npreponderately, or almost exclusively, designate one of the sexes, and\r\nthere are still others of which only the male or only the female\r\nsignification is known. To use long, firm objects and weapons as symbols\r\nof the female genitals, or hollow objects (chests, boxes, pouches, &c.),\r\nas symbols of the male genitals, is indeed not allowed by the fancy.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the tendency of the dream and the unconscious fancy to\r\nutilise the sexual symbol bisexually betrays an archaic trend, for in\r\nchildhood a difference in the genitals is unknown, and the same genitals\r\nare attributed to both sexes.\r\n\r\nThese very incomplete suggestions may suffice to stimulate others to\r\nmake a more careful collection.[CW]\r\n\r\nI shall now add a few examples of the application of such symbolisms in\r\ndreams, which will serve to show how impossible it becomes to interpret\r\na dream without taking into account the symbolism of dreams, and how\r\nimperatively it obtrudes itself in many cases.\r\n\r\n1. The hat as a symbol of the man (of the male genital):[CX] (a fragment\r\nfrom the dream of a young woman who suffered from agoraphobia on account\r\nof a fear of temptation).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am walking in the street in summer, I wear a straw hat of peculiar\r\nshape, the middle piece of which is bent upwards and the side pieces of\r\nwhich hang downwards (the description became here obstructed), and in\r\nsuch a fashion that one is lower than the other. I am cheerful and in a\r\nconfidential mood, and as I pass a troop of young officers I think to\r\nmyself: None of you can have any designs upon me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she could produce no associations to the hat, I said to her: \xe2\x80\x9cThe hat\r\nis really a male genital, with its raised middle piece and the two\r\ndownward hanging side pieces.\xe2\x80\x9d I intentionally refrained from\r\ninterpreting those details concerning the unequal downward hanging of\r\nthe two side pieces, although just such individualities in the\r\ndeterminations lead the way to the interpretation. I continued by saying\r\nthat if she only had a man with such a virile genital she would not have\r\nto fear the officers\xe2\x80\x94that is, she would have nothing to wish from them,\r\nfor she is mainly kept from going without protection and company by her\r\nfancies of temptation. This last explanation of her fear I had already\r\nbeen able to give her repeatedly on the basis of other material.\r\n\r\nIt is quite remarkable how the dreamer behaved after this\r\ninterpretation. She withdrew her description of the hat, and claimed not\r\nto have said that the two side pieces were hanging downwards. I was,\r\nhowever, too sure of what I had heard to allow myself to be misled, and\r\nI persisted in it. She was quiet for a while, and then found the courage\r\nto ask why it was that one of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s testicles was lower than the\r\nother, and whether it was the same in all men. With this the peculiar\r\ndetail of the hat was explained, and the whole interpretation was\r\naccepted by her. The hat symbol was familiar to me long before the\r\npatient related this dream. From other but less transparent cases I\r\nbelieve that the hat may also be taken as a female genital.\r\n\r\n2. The little one as the genital\xe2\x80\x94to be run over as a symbol of sexual\r\nintercourse (another dream of the same agoraphobic patient).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer mother sends away her little daughter so that she must go alone.\r\nShe rides with her mother to the railroad and sees her little one\r\nwalking directly upon the tracks, so that she cannot avoid being run\r\nover. She hears the bones crackle. (From this she experiences a feeling\r\nof discomfort but no real horror.) She then looks out through the car\r\nwindow to see whether the parts cannot be seen behind. She then\r\nreproaches her mother for allowing the little one to go out alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnalysis. It is not an easy matter to give here a complete\r\ninterpretation of the dream. It forms part of a cycle of dreams, and can\r\nbe fully understood only in connection with the others. For it is not\r\neasy to get the necessary material sufficiently isolated to prove the\r\nsymbolism. The patient at first finds that the railroad journey is to be\r\ninterpreted historically as an allusion to a departure from a sanatorium\r\nfor nervous diseases, with the superintendent of which she naturally was\r\nin love. Her mother took her away from this place, and the physician\r\ncame to the railroad station and handed her a bouquet of flowers on\r\nleaving; she felt uncomfortable because her mother witnessed this\r\nhomage. Here the mother, therefore, appears as a disturber of her love\r\naffairs, which is the r\xc3\xb4le actually played by this strict woman during\r\nher daughter\xe2\x80\x99s girlhood. The next thought referred to the sentence: \xe2\x80\x9cShe\r\nthen looks to see whether the parts can be seen behind.\xe2\x80\x9d In the dream\r\nfa\xc3\xa7ade one would naturally be compelled to think of the parts of the\r\nlittle daughter run over and ground up. The thought, however, turns in\r\nquite a different direction. She recalls that she once saw her father in\r\nthe bath-room naked from behind; she then begins to talk about the sex\r\ndifferentiation, and asserts that in the man the genitals can be seen\r\nfrom behind, but in the woman they cannot. In this connection she now\r\nherself offers the interpretation that the little one is the genital,\r\nher little one (she has a four-year-old daughter) her own genital. She\r\nreproaches her mother for wanting her to live as though she had no\r\ngenital, and recognises this reproach in the introductory sentence of\r\nthe dream; the mother sends away her little one so that she must go\r\nalone. In her phantasy going alone on the street signifies to have no\r\nman and no sexual relations (coire = to go together), and this she does\r\nnot like. According to all her statements she really suffered as a girl\r\non account of the jealousy of her mother, because she showed a\r\npreference for her father.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9clittle one\xe2\x80\x9d has been noted[CY] as a symbol for the male or the\r\nfemale genitals by Stekel, who can refer in this connection to a very\r\nwidespread usage of language.\r\n\r\nThe deeper interpretation of this dream depends upon another dream of\r\nthe same night in which the dreamer identifies herself with her brother.\r\nShe was a \xe2\x80\x9ctomboy,\xe2\x80\x9d and was always being told that she should have been\r\nborn a boy. This identification with the brother shows with special\r\nclearness that \xe2\x80\x9cthe little one\xe2\x80\x9d signifies the genital. The mother\r\nthreatened him (her) with castration, which could only be understood as\r\na punishment for playing with the parts, and the identification,\r\ntherefore, shows that she herself had masturbated as a child, though\r\nthis fact she now retained only in a memory concerning her brother. An\r\nearly knowledge of the male genital which she later lost she must have\r\nacquired at that time according to the assertions of this second dream.\r\nMoreover the second dream points to the infantile sexual theory that\r\ngirls originate from boys through castration. After I had told her of\r\nthis childish belief, she at once confirmed it with an anecdote in which\r\nthe boy asks the girl: \xe2\x80\x9cWas it cut off?\xe2\x80\x9d to which the girl replied, \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s always been so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sending away of the little one, of the genital, in the first dream\r\ntherefore also refers to the threatened castration. Finally she blames\r\nher mother for not having been born a boy.\r\n\r\nThat \xe2\x80\x9cbeing run over\xe2\x80\x9d symbolises sexual intercourse would not be evident\r\nfrom this dream if we were not sure of it from many other sources.\r\n\r\n3. Representation of the genital by structures, stairways, and shafts.\r\n(Dream of a young man inhibited by a father complex.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is taking a walk with his father in a place which is surely the\r\nPrater, for the _Rotunda_ may be seen in front of which there is a small\r\nfront structure to which is attached a captive balloon; the balloon,\r\nhowever, seems quite collapsed. His father asks him what this is all\r\nfor; he is surprised at it, but he explains it to his father. They come\r\ninto a court in which lies a large sheet of tin. His father wants to\r\npull off a big piece of this, but first looks around to see if anyone is\r\nwatching. He tells his father that all he needs to do is to speak to the\r\nwatchman, and then he can take without any further difficulty as much as\r\nhe wants to. From this court a stairway leads down into a shaft, the\r\nwalls of which are softly upholstered something like a leather\r\npocket-book. At the end of this shaft there is a longer platform, and\r\nthen a new shaft begins....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnalysis. This dream belongs to a type of patient which is not\r\nfavourable from a therapeutic point of view. They follow in the analysis\r\nwithout offering any resistances whatever up to a certain point, but\r\nfrom that point on they remain almost inaccessible. This dream he almost\r\nanalysed himself. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Rotunda,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis my genital, the captive\r\nballoon in front is my penis, about the weakness of which I have\r\nworried.\xe2\x80\x9d We must, however, interpret in greater detail; the Rotunda is\r\nthe buttock which is regularly associated by the child with the genital,\r\nthe smaller front structure is the scrotum. In the dream his father asks\r\nhim what this is all for\xe2\x80\x94that is, he asks him about the purpose and\r\narrangement of the genitals. It is quite evident that this state of\r\naffairs should be turned around, and that he should be the questioner.\r\nAs such a questioning on the side of the father has never taken place in\r\nreality, we must conceive the dream thought as a wish, or take it\r\nconditionally, as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had only asked my father for sexual\r\nenlightenment.\xe2\x80\x9d The continuation of this thought we shall soon find in\r\nanother place.\r\n\r\nThe court in which the tin sheet is spread out is not to be conceived\r\nsymbolically in the first instance, but originates from his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplace of business. For discretionary reasons I have inserted the tin for\r\nanother material in which the father deals, without, however, changing\r\nanything in the verbal expression of the dream. The dreamer had entered\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s business, and had taken a terrible dislike to the\r\nquestionable practices upon which profit mainly depends. Hence the\r\ncontinuation of the above dream thought (\xe2\x80\x9cif I had only asked him\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\nwould be: \xe2\x80\x9cHe would have deceived me just as he does his customers.\xe2\x80\x9d For\r\nthe pulling off, which serves to represent commercial dishonesty, the\r\ndreamer himself gives a second explanation\xe2\x80\x94namely, onanism. This is not\r\nonly entirely familiar to us (see above, p. 234), but agrees very well\r\nwith the fact that the secrecy of onanism is expressed by its opposite\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cWhy one can do it quite openly\xe2\x80\x9d). It, moreover, agrees entirely with\r\nour expectations that the onanistic activity is again put off on the\r\nfather, just as was the questioning in the first scene of the dream. The\r\nshaft he at once interprets as the vagina by referring to the soft\r\nupholstering of the walls. That the act of coition in the vagina is\r\ndescribed as a going down instead of in the usual way as a going up, I\r\nhave also found true in other instances.[CZ]\r\n\r\nThe details that at the end of the first shaft there is a longer\r\nplatform and then a new shaft, he himself explains biographically. He\r\nhad for some time consorted with women sexually, but had then given it\r\nup because of inhibitions and now hopes to be able to take it up again\r\nwith the aid of the treatment. The dream, however, becomes indistinct\r\ntoward the end, and to the experienced interpreter it becomes evident\r\nthat in the second scene of the dream the influence of another subject\r\nhas begun to assert itself; in this his father\xe2\x80\x99s business and his\r\ndishonest practices signify the first vagina represented as a shaft so\r\nthat one might think of a reference to the mother.\r\n\r\n4. The male genital symbolised by persons and the female by a landscape.\r\n\r\n(Dream of a woman of the lower class, whose husband is a policeman,\r\nreported by B. Dattner.)\r\n\r\n... Then someone broke into the house and anxiously called for a\r\npoliceman. But he went with two tramps by mutual consent into a\r\nchurch,[DA] to which led a great many stairs;[DB] behind the church\r\nthere was a mountain,[DC] on top of which a dense forest.[DD] The\r\npoliceman was furnished with a helmet, a gorget, and a cloak.[DE] The\r\ntwo vagrants, who went along with the policeman quite peaceably, had\r\ntied to their loins sack-like aprons.[DF] A road led from the church to\r\nthe mountain. This road was overgrown on each side with grass and\r\nbrushwood, which became thicker and thicker as it reached the height of\r\nthe mountain, where it spread out into quite a forest.\r\n\r\n5. A stairway dream.\r\n\r\n(Reported and interpreted by Otto Rank.)\r\n\r\nFor the following transparent pollution dream, I am indebted to the same\r\ncolleague who furnished us with the dental-irritation dream reported on\r\np. 235.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am running down the stairway in the stair-house after a little girl,\r\nwhom I wish to punish because she has done something to me. At the\r\nbottom of the stairs some one held the child for me. (A grown-up woman?)\r\nI grasp it, but do not know whether I have hit it, for I suddenly find\r\nmyself in the middle of the stairway where I practise coitus with the\r\nchild (in the air as it were). It is really no coitus, I only rub my\r\ngenital on her external genital, and in doing this I see it very\r\ndistinctly, as distinctly as I see her head which is lying sideways.\r\nDuring the sexual act I see hanging to the left and above me (also as if\r\nin the air) two small pictures, landscapes, representing a house on a\r\ngreen. On the smaller one my surname stood in the place where the\r\npainter\xe2\x80\x99s signature should be; it seemed to be intended for my birthday\r\npresent. A small sign hung in front of the pictures to the effect that\r\ncheaper pictures could also be obtained. I then see myself very\r\nindistinctly lying in bed, just as I had seen myself at the foot of the\r\nstairs, and I am awakened by a feeling of dampness which came from the\r\npollution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInterpretation. The dreamer had been in a book-store on the evening of\r\nthe day of the dream, where, while he was waiting, he examined some\r\npictures which were exhibited, which represented motives similar to the\r\ndream pictures. He stepped nearer to a small picture which particularly\r\ntook his fancy in order to see the name of the artist, which, however,\r\nwas quite unknown to him.\r\n\r\nLater in the same evening, in company, he heard about a Bohemian\r\nservant-girl who boasted that her illegitimate child \xe2\x80\x9cwas made on the\r\nstairs.\xe2\x80\x9d The dreamer inquired about the details of this unusual\r\noccurrence, and learned that the servant-girl went with her lover to the\r\nhome of her parents, where there was no opportunity for sexual\r\nrelations, and that the excited man performed the act on the stairs. In\r\nwitty allusion to the mischievous expression used about wine-adulterers,\r\nthe dreamer remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cThe child really grew on the cellar steps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese experiences of the day, which are quite prominent in the dream\r\ncontent, were readily reproduced by the dreamer. But he just as readily\r\nreproduced an old fragment of infantile recollection which was also\r\nutilised by the dream. The stair-house was the house in which he had\r\nspent the greatest part of his childhood, and in which he had first\r\nbecome acquainted with sexual problems. In this house he used, among\r\nother things, to slide down the banister astride which caused him to\r\nbecome sexually excited. In the dream he also comes down the stairs very\r\nrapidly\xe2\x80\x94so rapidly that, according to his own distinct assertions, he\r\nhardly touched the individual stairs, but rather \xe2\x80\x9cflew\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cslid down,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nas we used to say. Upon reference to this infantile experience, the\r\nbeginning of the dream seems to represent the factor of sexual\r\nexcitement. In the same house and in the adjacent residence the dreamer\r\nused to play pugnacious games with the neighbouring children, in which\r\nhe satisfied himself just as he did in the dream.\r\n\r\nIf one recalls from Freud\xe2\x80\x99s investigation of sexual symbolism[DG] that\r\nin the dream stairs or climbing stairs almost regularly symbolises\r\ncoitus, the dream becomes clear. Its motive power as well as its effect,\r\nas is shown by the pollution, is of a purely libidinous nature. Sexual\r\nexcitement became aroused during the sleeping state (in the dream this\r\nis represented by the rapid running or sliding down the stairs) and the\r\nsadistic thread in this is, on the basis of the pugnacious playing,\r\nindicated in the pursuing and overcoming of the child. The libidinous\r\nexcitement becomes enhanced and urges to sexual action (represented in\r\nthe dream by the grasping of the child and the conveyance of it to the\r\nmiddle of the stairway). Up to this point the dream would be one of pure\r\nsexual symbolism, and obscure for the unpractised dream interpreter. But\r\nthis symbolic gratification, which would have insured undisturbed sleep,\r\nwas not sufficient for the powerful libidinous excitement. The\r\nexcitement leads to an orgasm, and thus the whole stairway symbolism is\r\nunmasked as a substitute for coitus. Freud lays stress on the rhythmical\r\ncharacter of both actions as one of the reasons for the sexual\r\nutilisation of the stairway symbolism, and this dream especially seems\r\nto corroborate this, for, according to the express assertion of the\r\ndreamer, the rhythm of a sexual act was the most pronounced feature in\r\nthe whole dream.\r\n\r\nStill another remark concerning the two pictures, which, aside from\r\ntheir real significance, also have the value of \xe2\x80\x9cWeibsbilder\xe2\x80\x9d (literally\r\n_woman-pictures_, but idiomatically _women_). This is at once shown by\r\nthe fact that the dream deals with a big and a little picture, just as\r\nthe dream content presents a big (grown up) and a little girl. That\r\ncheap pictures could also be obtained points to the prostitution\r\ncomplex, just as the dreamer\xe2\x80\x99s surname on the little picture and the\r\nthought that it was intended for his birthday, point to the parent\r\ncomplex (to be born on the stairway\xe2\x80\x94to be conceived in coitus).\r\n\r\nThe indistinct final scene, in which the dreamer sees himself on the\r\nstaircase landing lying in bed and feeling wet, seems to go back into\r\nchildhood even beyond the infantile onanism, and manifestly has its\r\nprototype in similarly pleasurable scenes of bed-wetting.\r\n\r\n6. A modified stair-dream.\r\n\r\nTo one of my very nervous patients, who was an abstainer, whose fancy\r\nwas fixed on his mother, and who repeatedly dreamed of climbing stairs\r\naccompanied by his mother, I once remarked that moderate masturbation\r\nwould be less harmful to him than enforced abstinence. This influence\r\nprovoked the following dream:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis piano teacher reproaches him for neglecting his piano-playing, and\r\nfor not practising the _\xc3\x89tudes_ of Moscheles and Clementi\xe2\x80\x99s _Gradus ad\r\nParnassum_.\xe2\x80\x9d In relation to this he remarked that the _Gradus_ is only a\r\nstairway, and that the piano itself is only a stairway as it has a\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nIt is correct to say that there is no series of associations which\r\ncannot be adapted to the representation of sexual facts. I conclude with\r\nthe dream of a chemist, a young man, who has been trying to give up his\r\nhabit of masturbation by replacing it with intercourse with women.\r\n\r\n_Preliminary statement._\xe2\x80\x94On the day before the dream he had given a\r\nstudent instruction concerning Grignard\xe2\x80\x99s reaction, in which magnesium\r\nis to be dissolved in absolutely pure ether under the catalytic\r\ninfluence of iodine. Two days before, there had been an explosion in the\r\ncourse of the same reaction, in which the investigator had burned his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nDream I. _He is to make phenylmagnesiumbromid; he sees the apparatus\r\nwith particular clearness, but he has substituted himself for the\r\nmagnesium. He is now in a curious swaying attitude. He keeps repeating\r\nto himself, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the right thing, it is working, my feet are\r\nbeginning to dissolve and my knees are getting soft.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he reaches\r\ndown and feels for his feet, and meanwhile (he does not know how) he\r\ntakes his legs out of the crucible, and then again he says to himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat cannot be.... Yes, it must be so, it has been done correctly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen he partially awakens, and repeats the dream to himself, because he\r\nwants to tell it to me. He is distinctly afraid of the analysis of the\r\ndream. He is much excited during this semi-sleeping state, and repeats\r\ncontinually, \xe2\x80\x9cPhenyl, phenyl.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nII. _He is in ... ing with his whole family; at half-past eleven. He is\r\nto be at the Schottenthor for a rendezvous with a certain lady, but he\r\ndoes not wake up until half-past eleven. He says to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is too\r\nlate now; when you get there it will be half-past twelve.\xe2\x80\x9d The next\r\ninstant he sees the whole family gathered about the table\xe2\x80\x94his mother and\r\nthe servant girl with the soup-tureen with particular clearness. Then he\r\nsays to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if we are eating already, I certainly can\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nAnalysis: He feels sure that even the first dream contains a reference\r\nto the lady whom he is to meet at the rendezvous (the dream was dreamed\r\nduring the night before the expected meeting). The student to whom he\r\ngave the instruction is a particularly unpleasant fellow; he had said to\r\nthe chemist: \xe2\x80\x9cThat isn\xe2\x80\x99t right,\xe2\x80\x9d because the magnesium was still\r\nunaffected, and the latter answered as though he did not care anything\r\nabout it: \xe2\x80\x9cIt certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t right.\xe2\x80\x9d He himself must be this student;\r\nhe is as indifferent towards his analysis as the student is towards his\r\nsynthesis; the _He_ in the dream, however, who accomplishes the\r\noperation, is myself. How unpleasant he must seem to me with his\r\nindifference towards the success achieved!\r\n\r\nMoreover, he is the material with which the analysis (synthesis) is\r\nmade. For it is a question of the success of the treatment. The legs in\r\nthe dream recall an impression of the previous evening. He met a lady at\r\na dancing lesson whom he wished to conquer; he pressed her to him so\r\nclosely that she once cried out. After he had stopped pressing against\r\nher legs, he felt her firm responding pressure against his lower thighs\r\nas far as just above his knees, at the place mentioned in the dream. In\r\nthis situation, then, the woman is the magnesium in the retort, which is\r\nat last working. He is feminine towards me, as he is masculine towards\r\nthe woman. If it will work with the woman, the treatment will also work.\r\nFeeling and becoming aware of himself in the region of his knees refers\r\nto masturbation, and corresponds to his fatigue of the previous day....\r\nThe rendezvous had actually been set for half-past eleven. His wish to\r\nover-sleep and to remain with his usual sexual objects (that is, with\r\nmasturbation) corresponds with his resistance.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the repetition of the name phenyl, he gives the following\r\nthoughts: All these radicals ending in _yl_ have always been pleasing to\r\nhim; they are very convenient to use: benzyl, azetyl, &c. That, however,\r\nexplained nothing. But when I proposed the radical Schlemihl[DH] he\r\nlaughed heartily, and related that during the summer he had read a book\r\nby Pr\xc3\xa9vost which contained a chapter: \xe2\x80\x9cLes exclus de l\xe2\x80\x99amour,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\ndescription in which made him think of the Schlemihls, and he added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my case.\xe2\x80\x9d He would have again acted the Schlemihl if he had\r\nmissed the rendezvous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n                             THE DREAM-WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nAll previous attempts to solve the problems of the dream have been based\r\ndirectly upon the manifest dream content as it is retained in the\r\nmemory, and have undertaken to obtain an interpretation of the dream\r\nfrom this content, or, if interpretation was dispensed with, to base a\r\njudgment of the dream upon the evidence furnished by this content. We\r\nalone are in possession of new data; for us a new psychic material\r\nintervenes between the dream content and the results of our\r\ninvestigations: and this is the _latent_ dream content or the dream\r\nthoughts which are obtained by our method. We develop a solution of the\r\ndream from this latter, and not from the manifest dream content. We are\r\nalso confronted for the first time with a problem which has not before\r\nexisted, that of examining and tracing the relations between the latent\r\ndream thoughts and the manifest dream content, and the processes through\r\nwhich the former have grown into the latter.\r\n\r\nWe regard the dream thoughts and the dream content as two\r\nrepresentations of the same meaning in two different languages; or to\r\nexpress it better, the dream content appears to us as a translation of\r\nthe dream thoughts into another form of expression, whose signs and laws\r\nof composition we are to learn by comparing the original with the\r\ntranslation. The dream thoughts are at once intelligible to us as soon\r\nas we have ascertained them. The dream content is, as it were, presented\r\nin a picture-writing, whose signs are to be translated one by one into\r\nthe language of the dream thoughts. It would of course be incorrect to\r\ntry to read these signs according to their values as pictures instead of\r\naccording to their significance as signs. For instance, I have before me\r\na picture-puzzle (rebus): a house, upon whose roof there is a boat; then\r\na running figure whose head has been apostrophised away, and the like. I\r\nmight now be tempted as a critic to consider this composition and its\r\nelements nonsensical. A boat does not belong on the roof of a house and\r\na person without a head cannot run; the person, too, is larger than the\r\nhouse, and if the whole thing is to represent a landscape, the single\r\nletters of the alphabet do not fit into it, for of course they do not\r\noccur in pure nature. A correct judgment of the picture-puzzle results\r\nonly if I make no such objections to the whole and its parts, but if, on\r\nthe contrary, I take pains to replace each picture by the syllable or\r\nword which it is capable of representing by means of any sort of\r\nreference, the words which are thus brought together are no longer\r\nmeaningless, but may constitute a most beautiful and sensible\r\nexpression. Now the dream is a picture-puzzle of this sort, and our\r\npredecessors in the field of dream interpretation have made the mistake\r\nof judging the rebus as an artistic composition. As such it appears\r\nnonsensical and worthless.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     (_a_) _The Condensation Work_\r\n\r\nThe first thing which becomes clear to the investigator in the\r\ncomparison of the dream content with the dream thoughts is that a\r\ntremendous work of condensation has taken place. The dream is reserved,\r\npaltry, and laconic when compared with the range and copiousness of the\r\ndream thoughts. The dream when written down fills half a page; the\r\nanalysis, in which the dream thoughts are contained, requires six,\r\neight, twelve times as much space. The ratio varies with different\r\ndreams; it never changes its essential meaning, as far as I have been\r\nable to observe. As a rule the extent of the compression which has taken\r\nplace is under-estimated, owing to the fact that the dream thoughts\r\nwhich are brought to light are considered the complete material, while\r\ncontinued work of interpretation may reveal new thoughts which are\r\nconcealed behind the dream. We have already mentioned that one is really\r\nnever sure of having interpreted a dream completely; even if the\r\nsolution seems satisfying and flawless, it still always remains possible\r\nthat there is a further meaning which is manifested by the same dream.\r\nThus the _amount of condensation_ is\xe2\x80\x94strictly speaking\xe2\x80\x94indeterminable.\r\nAn objection, which at first sight seems very plausible, might be raised\r\nagainst the assertion that the disproportion between dream content and\r\ndream thought justifies the conclusion that an abundant condensation of\r\npsychic material has taken place in the formation of dreams. For we so\r\noften have the impression that we have dreamed a great deal throughout\r\nthe night and then have forgotten the greater part. The dream which we\r\nrecollect upon awakening would thus be only a remnant of the total\r\ndream-work, which would probably equal the dream thoughts in range if we\r\nwere able to remember the former completely. In part this is certainly\r\ntrue; there can be no mistake about the observation that the dream is\r\nmost accurately reproduced if one tries to remember it immediately after\r\nawakening, and that the recollection of it becomes more and more\r\ndefective towards evening. On the other hand, it must be admitted that\r\nthe impression that we have dreamed a good deal more than we are able to\r\nreproduce is often based upon an illusion, the cause of which will be\r\nexplained later. Moreover, the assumption of condensation in the dream\r\nactivity is not affected by the possibility of forgetting in dreams, for\r\nit is proved by groups of ideas belonging to those particular parts of\r\nthe dream which have remained in the memory. If a large part of the\r\ndream has actually been lost to memory, we are probably deprived of\r\naccess to a new series of dream thoughts. It is altogether unjustifiable\r\nto expect that those portions of the dream which have been lost also\r\nrelate to the thoughts with which we are already acquainted from the\r\nanalysis of the portions which have been preserved.\r\n\r\nIn view of the great number of ideas which analysis furnishes for each\r\nindividual element of the dream content, the chief doubt with many\r\nreaders will be whether it is permissible to count everything that\r\nsubsequently comes to mind during analysis as a part of the dream\r\nthoughts\xe2\x80\x94to assume, in other words, that all these thoughts have been\r\nactive in the sleeping state and have taken part in the formation of the\r\ndream. Is it not more probable that thought connections are developed in\r\nthe course of analysis which did not participate in the formation of the\r\ndream? I can meet this doubt only conditionally. It is true, of course,\r\nthat particular thought connections first arise only during analysis;\r\nbut one may always be sure that such new connections have been\r\nestablished only between thoughts which have already been connected in\r\nthe dream thoughts by other means; the new connections are, so to speak,\r\ncorollaries, short circuits, which are made possible by the existence of\r\nother more fundamental means of connection. It must be admitted that the\r\nhuge number of trains of thought revealed by analysis have already been\r\nactive in the formation of the dream, for if a chain of thoughts has\r\nbeen worked out, which seems to be without connection with the formation\r\nof the dream, a thought is suddenly encountered which, being represented\r\nin the dream, is indispensable to its interpretation\xe2\x80\x94which nevertheless\r\nis inaccessible except through that chain of thoughts. The reader may\r\nhere turn to the dream of the botanical monograph, which is obviously\r\nthe result of an astonishing condensation activity, even though I have\r\nnot given the analysis of it completely.\r\n\r\nBut how, then, is the psychic condition during sleep which precedes\r\ndreaming to be imagined? Do all the dream thoughts exist side by side,\r\nor do they occur one after another, or are many simultaneous trains of\r\nthought constructed from different centres, which meet later on? I am of\r\nthe opinion that it is not yet necessary to form a plastic conception of\r\nthe psychic condition of dream formation. Only let us not forget that we\r\nare concerned with unconscious thought, and that the process may easily\r\nbe a different one from that which we perceive in ourselves in\r\nintentional contemplation accompanied by consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe fact, however, that dream formation is based on a process of\r\ncondensation, stands indubitable. How, then, is this condensation\r\nbrought about?\r\n\r\nIf it be considered that of those dream thoughts which are found only\r\nthe smallest number are represented in the dream by means of one of its\r\nideal elements, it might be concluded that condensation is accomplished\r\nby means of ellipsis, in that the dream is not an accurate translation\r\nor a projection point by point of the dream thoughts, but a very\r\nincomplete and defective reproduction of them. This view, as we shall\r\nsoon find, is a very inadequate one. But let us take it as a starting\r\npoint for the present, and ask ourselves: If only a few of the elements\r\nof the dream thoughts get into the dream content, what conditions\r\ndetermine their choice?\r\n\r\nIn order to gain enlightenment on this subject let us turn our attention\r\nto those elements of the dream content which must have fulfilled the\r\nconditions we are seeking. A dream to the formation of which an\r\nespecially strong condensation has contributed will be the most suitable\r\nmaterial for this investigation. I select the dream, cited on page 142,\r\nof the botanical monograph.\r\n\r\nDream content: _I have written a monograph upon a (obscure) certain\r\nplant. The book lies before me, I am just turning over a folded coloured\r\nplate. A dried specimen of the plant is bound with every copy as though\r\nfrom a herbarium._\r\n\r\nThe most prominent element of this dream is the botanical monograph.\r\nThis comes from the impressions received on the day of the dream; I had\r\nactually _seen a monograph on the genus \xe2\x80\x9ccyclamen\xe2\x80\x9d_ in the show-window\r\nof a book-store. The mention of this genus is lacking in the dream\r\ncontent, in which only the monograph and its relation to botany have\r\nremained. The \xe2\x80\x9cbotanical monograph\xe2\x80\x9d immediately shows its relation to\r\nthe work on cocaine which I had once written; thought connections\r\nproceed from cocaine on the one hand to a \xe2\x80\x9cFestschrift,\xe2\x80\x9d and on the\r\nother to my friend, the eye specialist, Dr. Koenigstein, who has had a\r\nshare in the utilisation of cocaine. Moreover, with the person of this\r\nDr. Koenigstein is connected the recollection of the interrupted\r\nconversation which I had had with him on the previous evening and of the\r\nmanifold thoughts about remuneration for medical services among\r\ncolleagues. This conversation, then, is properly the actual stimulus of\r\nthe dream; the monograph about cyclamen is likewise an actuality but of\r\nan indifferent nature; as I soon see, the \xe2\x80\x9cbotanical monograph\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\ndream turns out to be a common mean between the two experiences of the\r\nday, and to have been taken over unchanged from an indifferent\r\nimpression and bound up with the psychologically significant experience\r\nby means of the most abundant associations.\r\n\r\nNot only the combined idea, \xe2\x80\x9cbotanical monograph,\xe2\x80\x9d however, but also\r\neach of the separate elements, \xe2\x80\x9cbotanical\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmonograph,\xe2\x80\x9d penetrates\r\ndeeper and deeper into the confused tangle of the dream thoughts. To\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbotanical\xe2\x80\x9d belong the recollections of the person of Professor\r\n_Gartner_ (German: G\xc3\xa4rtner = gardener), of his _blooming_ wife, of my\r\npatient whose name is _Flora_, and of a lady about whom I told the story\r\nof the forgotten _flowers_. _Gartner_, again, is connected with the\r\nlaboratory and the conversation with _Koenigstein_; the mention of the\r\ntwo female patients also belongs to the same conversation. A chain of\r\nthoughts, one end of which is formed by the title of the hastily seen\r\nmonograph, leads off in the other direction from the lady with the\r\nflowers to the _favourite flowers_ of my wife. Besides this, \xe2\x80\x9cbotanical\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nrecalls not only an episode at the Gymnasium, but an examination taken\r\nwhile I was at the university; and a new subject matter\xe2\x80\x94my hobbies\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nwas broached in the conversation already mentioned, is connected by\r\nmeans of my humorously so-called _favourite flower_, the artichoke, with\r\nthe chain of thoughts proceeding from the forgotten flowers; behind\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cartichoke\xe2\x80\x9d there is concealed on the one hand a recollection of Italy,\r\nand on the other a reminiscence of a childhood scene in which I first\r\nformed my connection with books which has since grown so intimate.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBotanical,\xe2\x80\x9d then, is a veritable nucleus, the centre for the dream of\r\nmany trains of thought, which, I may assure the reader, were correctly\r\nand justly brought into relation to one another in the conversation\r\nreferred to. Here we find ourselves in a thought factory, in which, as\r\nin the \xe2\x80\x9cWeaver\xe2\x80\x99s Masterpiece\xe2\x80\x9d:\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x9cOne tread moves thousands of threads,\r\n                The little shuttles fly back and forth,\r\n                The threads flow on unseen,\r\n                One stroke ties thousands of knots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Monograph_\xe2\x80\x9d in the dream, again, has a bearing upon two subjects, the\r\none-sidedness of my studies and the costliness of my hobbies.\r\n\r\nThe impression is gained from this first investigation that the elements\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbotanical\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmonograph\xe2\x80\x9d have been accepted in the dream content\r\nbecause they were able to show the most extensive connections with the\r\ndream thoughts, and thus represent nuclei in which a great number of\r\ndream thoughts come together, and because they have manifold\r\nsignificance for the dream interpretation. The fact upon which this\r\nexplanation is based may be expressed in another form: Every element of\r\nthe dream content turns out to be _over-determined_\xe2\x80\x94that is, it enjoys a\r\nmanifold representation in the dream thoughts.\r\n\r\nWe shall learn more by testing the remaining component parts of the\r\ndream as to their occurrence in the dream thoughts. _The coloured plate_\r\nrefers (_cf._ the analysis on p. 145) to a new subject, the criticism\r\npassed upon my work by colleagues, and to a subject already represented\r\nin the dream\xe2\x80\x94my hobbies\xe2\x80\x94and also to a childish recollection in which I\r\npull to pieces the book with the coloured plates; the dried specimen of\r\nthe plant relates to an experience at the Gymnasium centering about and\r\nparticularly emphasizing the herbarium. Thus I see what sort of relation\r\nexists between the dream content and dream thoughts: Not only do the\r\nelements of the dream have a manifold determination in the dream\r\nthoughts, but the individual dream thoughts are represented in the dream\r\nby many elements. Starting from an element of the dream the path of\r\nassociations leads to a number of dream thoughts; and from a dream\r\nthought to several elements of the dream. The formation of the dream\r\ndoes not, therefore, take place in such fashion that a single one of the\r\ndream thoughts or a group of them furnishes the dream content with an\r\nabridgment as its representative therein, and that then another dream\r\nthought furnishes another abridgment as its representative\xe2\x80\x94somewhat as\r\npopular representatives are elected from among the people\xe2\x80\x94but the whole\r\nmass of the dream thoughts is subjected to a certain elaboration, in the\r\ncourse of which those elements that receive the greatest and completest\r\nsupport stand out in relief, analogous, perhaps, to election by\r\n_scrutins des listes_. Whatever dream I may subject to such\r\ndismemberment, I always find the same fundamental principle\r\nconfirmed\xe2\x80\x94that the dream elements are constructed from the entire mass\r\nof the dream thoughts and that every one of them appears in relation to\r\nthe dream thoughts to have a multiple determination.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly not out of place to demonstrate this relation of the\r\ndream content to the dream thoughts by means of a fresh example, which\r\nis distinguished by a particularly artful intertwining of reciprocal\r\nrelations. The dream is that of a patient whom I am treating for\r\nclaustrophobia (fear in enclosed spaces). It will soon become evident\r\nwhy I feel myself called upon to entitle this exceptionally intellectual\r\npiece of dream activity in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\r\n                       II. \xe2\x80\x9c_A Beautiful Dream_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_The dreamer is riding with much company to X-street, where there is a\r\nmodest road-house_ (which is not the fact). _A theatrical performance is\r\nbeing given in its rooms. He is first audience, then actor. Finally the\r\ncompany is told to change their clothes, in order to get back into the\r\ncity. Some of the people are assigned to the rooms on the ground floor,\r\nothers to the first floor. Then a dispute arises. Those above are angry\r\nbecause those below have not yet finished, so that they cannot come\r\ndown. His brother is upstairs, he is below, and he is angry at his\r\nbrother because there is such crowding._ (This part obscure.) _Besides\r\nit has already been decided upon their arrival who is to be upstairs and\r\nwho down. Then he goes alone over the rising ground, across which\r\nX-street leads toward the city, and he has such difficulty and hardship\r\nin walking that he cannot move from the spot. An elderly gentleman joins\r\nhim and scolds about the King of Italy. Finally, towards the end of the\r\nrising ground walking becomes much easier._\r\n\r\nThe difficulties experienced in walking were so distinct that for some\r\ntime after waking he was in doubt whether they were dream or reality.\r\n\r\nAccording to the manifest content, this dream can hardly be praised.\r\nContrary to the rules, I shall begin with that portion which the dreamer\r\nreferred to as the most distinct.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties which were dreamed of, and which were probably\r\nexperienced during the dream\xe2\x80\x94difficult climbing accompanied by\r\ndyspn\xc5\x93a\xe2\x80\x94is one of the symptoms which the patient had actually shown\r\nyears before, and which, in conjunction with other symptoms, was at that\r\ntime attributed to tuberculosis (probably hysterically simulated). We\r\nare already from exhibition dreams acquainted with this sensation of\r\nbeing hindered, peculiar to the dream, and here again we find it used\r\nfor the purpose of any kind of representation, as an ever-ready\r\nmaterial. That part of the dream content which ascribes the climbing as\r\ndifficult at first, and as becoming easier at the end of the hill, made\r\nme think while it was being told of the well-known masterful\r\nintroduction to _Sappho_ by A. Daudet. Here a young man carries the girl\r\nwhom he loves upstairs\xe2\x80\x94she is at first as light as a feather; but the\r\nhigher he mounts the more heavily she weighs upon his arm, and this\r\nscene symbolises a course of events by recounting which Daudet tries to\r\nwarn young men not to waste serious affection upon girls of humble\r\norigin or of questionable past.[DI] Although I knew that my patient had\r\nrecently had a love affair with a lady of the theatre, and had broken it\r\noff, I did not expect to find that the interpretation which had occurred\r\nto me was correct. Moreover, the situation in _Sappho_ was the _reverse_\r\nof that in the dream; in the latter the climbing was difficult at the\r\nbeginning and easy later on; in the novel the symbolism serves only if\r\nwhat was at first regarded as easy finally turns out to be a heavy load.\r\nTo my astonishment, the patient remarked that the interpretation\r\ncorresponded closely to the plot of a play which he had seen on the\r\nevening before at the theatre. The play was called _Round about Vienna_,\r\nand treated of the career of a girl who is respectable at first but\r\nlater goes over to the _demi-monde_, who has affairs with persons in\r\nhigh places, thus \xe2\x80\x9cclimbing,\xe2\x80\x9d but finally \xe2\x80\x9cgoes down\xe2\x80\x9d faster and faster.\r\nThis play had reminded him of another entitled _From Step to Step_, in\r\nthe advertisement of which had appeared a _stairway_ consisting of\r\nseveral steps.\r\n\r\nNow to continue the interpretation. The actress with whom he had had his\r\nmost recent affair, a complicated one, had lived in X-street. There is\r\nno inn in this street. However, while he was spending a part of the\r\nsummer in Vienna for the sake of the lady, he had lodged (German\r\n_abgestiegen_ = stopped, literally _stepped off_) at a little hotel in\r\nthe neighbourhood. As he was leaving the hotel he said to the\r\ncab-driver, \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get any vermin anyway\xe2\x80\x9d (which\r\nincidentally is one of his phobias). Whereupon the cab-driver answered:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could anybody stop there! It isn\xe2\x80\x99t a hotel at all, it\xe2\x80\x99s really\r\nnothing but a _road-house_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe road-house immediately suggests to the dreamer\xe2\x80\x99s recollection a\r\nquotation:\r\n\r\n                        \xe2\x80\x9cOf that marvellous host\r\n                        I was once a guest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the host in the poem by Uhland is an apple tree. Now a second\r\nquotation continues the train of thought:\r\n\r\n                FAUST (_dancing with the young witch_).\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x9cA lovely dream once came to me;\r\n                I then beheld an apple tree,\r\n                And there two fairest apples shone:\r\n                They lured me so, I climbed thereon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                         THE FAIR ONE.\r\n\r\n             \xe2\x80\x9cApples have been desired by you,\r\n             Since first in Paradise they grew;\r\n             And I am moved with joy to know\r\n             That such within my garden grow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                             _Translated by_ BAYARD TAYLOR.\r\n\r\nThere remains not the slightest doubt what is meant by the apple tree\r\nand the apples. A beautiful bosom stood high among the charms with which\r\nthe actress had bewitched our dreamer.\r\n\r\nAccording to the connections of the analysis we had every reason to\r\nassume that the dream went back to an impression from childhood. In this\r\ncase it must have reference to the nurse of the patient, who is now a\r\nman of nearly fifty years of age. The bosom of the nurse is in reality a\r\nroad-house for the child. The nurse as well as Daudet\xe2\x80\x99s Sappho appears\r\nas an allusion to his abandoned sweetheart.\r\n\r\nThe (elder) brother of the patient also appears in the dream content; he\r\nis upstairs, the dreamer himself is below. This again is an _inversion_,\r\nfor the brother, as I happen to know, has lost his social position, my\r\npatient has retained his. In reporting the dream content the dreamer\r\navoided saying that his brother was upstairs and that he himself was\r\n_down_. It would have been too frank an expression, for a person is said\r\nto be \xe2\x80\x9cdown and out\xe2\x80\x9d when he has lost his fortune and position. Now the\r\nfact that at this point in the dream something is represented as\r\ninverted must have a meaning. The inversion must apply rather to some\r\nother relation between the dream thoughts and dream content. There is an\r\nindication which suggests how this inversion is to be taken. It\r\nobviously applies to the end of the dream, where the circumstances of\r\nclimbing are the reverse of those in _Sappho_. Now it may easily be seen\r\nwhat inversion is referred to; in _Sappho_ the man carries the woman who\r\nstands in a sexual relation to him; in the dream thoughts, _inversely_,\r\na woman carries a man, and as this state of affairs can only occur\r\nduring childhood, the reference is again to the nurse who carries the\r\nheavy child. Thus the final portion of the dream succeeds in\r\nrepresenting _Sappho_ and the nurse in the same allusion.\r\n\r\nJust as the name _Sappho_ has not been selected by the poet without\r\nreference to a Lesbian custom, so the elements of the dream in which\r\npersons act _above_ and _below_, point to fancies of a sexual nature\r\nwith which the dreamer is occupied and which as suppressed cravings are\r\nnot without connection with his neurosis. Dream interpretation itself\r\ndoes not show that these are fancies and not recollections of actual\r\nhappenings; it only furnishes us with a set of thoughts and leaves us to\r\ndetermine their value as realities. Real and fantastic occurrences at\r\nfirst appear here as of equal value\xe2\x80\x94and not only here but also in the\r\ncreation of more important psychic structures than dreams. Much company,\r\nas we already know, signifies a secret. The brother is none other than a\r\nrepresentative, drawn into the childhood scene by \xe2\x80\x9cfancying backwards,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nof all of the later rivals for the woman. Through the agency of an\r\nexperience which is indifferent in itself, the episode with the\r\ngentleman who scolds about the King of Italy again refers to the\r\nintrusion of people of low rank into aristocratic society. It is as\r\nthough the warning which Daudet gives to youth is to be supplemented by\r\na similar warning applicable to the suckling child.[DJ]\r\n\r\nIn order that we may have at our disposal a third example for the study\r\nof condensation in dream formation, I shall cite the partial analysis of\r\nanother dream for which I am indebted to an elderly lady who is being\r\npsychoanalytically treated. In harmony with the condition of severe\r\nanxiety from which the patient suffered, her dreams contained a great\r\nabundance of sexual thought material, the discovery of which astonished\r\nas well as frightened her. Since I cannot carry the interpretation of\r\nthe dream to completion, the material seems to fall apart into several\r\ngroups without apparent connection.\r\n\r\nIII. Content of the dream: _She remembers that she has two June bugs in\r\na box, which she must set at liberty, for otherwise they will suffocate.\r\nShe opens the box, and the bugs are quite exhausted; one of them flies\r\nout of the window, but the other is crushed on the casement while she is\r\nshutting the window, as some one or other requests her to do\r\n(expressions of disgust)._\r\n\r\nAnalysis: Her husband is away travelling, and her fourteen-year-old\r\ndaughter is sleeping in the bed next to her. In the evening the little\r\none calls her attention to the fact that a moth has fallen into her\r\nglass of water; but she neglects to take it out, and feels sorry for the\r\npoor little creature in the morning. A story which she had read in the\r\nevening told of boys throwing a cat into boiling water, and the\r\ntwitchings of the animal were described. These are the occasions for the\r\ndream, both of which are indifferent in themselves. She is further\r\noccupied with the subject of _cruelty to animals_. Years before, while\r\nthey were spending the summer at a certain place, her daughter was very\r\ncruel to animals. She started a butterfly collection, and asked her for\r\narsenic with which to kill the butterflies. Once it happened that a moth\r\nflew about the room for a long time with a needle through its body; on\r\nanother occasion she found that some moths which had been kept for\r\nmetamorphosis had died of starvation. The same child while still at a\r\ntender age was in the habit of pulling out the wings of beetles and\r\nbutterflies; now she would shrink in horror from these cruel actions,\r\nfor she has grown very kind.\r\n\r\nHer mind is occupied with this contrast. It recalls another contrast,\r\nthe one between appearance and disposition, as it is described in _Adam\r\nBede_ by George Eliot. There a beautiful but vain and quite stupid girl\r\nis placed side by side with an ugly but high-minded one. The aristocrat\r\nwho seduces the little goose, is opposed to the working man who feels\r\n_aristocratic_, and behaves accordingly. It is impossible to tell\r\ncharacter from people\xe2\x80\x99s _looks_. Who could tell from _her_ looks that\r\nshe is tormented by sensual desires?\r\n\r\nIn the same year in which the little girl started her butterfly\r\ncollection, the region in which they were staying suffered much from a\r\npest of June bugs. The children made havoc among the bugs, and _crushed_\r\nthem cruelly. At that time she saw a person who tore the wings off the\r\nJune bugs and ate them. She herself had been born in June and also\r\nmarried in June. Three days after the wedding she wrote a letter home,\r\ntelling how happy she was. But she was by no means happy.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening before the dream she had rummaged among her old\r\nletters and had read various ones, comical and serious, to her family\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nextremely ridiculous letter from a piano-teacher who had paid her\r\nattention when she was a girl, as well as one from an aristocratic\r\nadmirer.[DK]\r\n\r\nShe blames herself because a bad book by de Maupassant had fallen into\r\nthe hands of one of her daughters.[DL] The arsenic which her little girl\r\nasks for recalls the arsenic pills which restored the power of youth to\r\nthe Duc de Mora in _Nabab_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSet at liberty\xe2\x80\x9d recalls to her a passage from the _Magic Flute_:\r\n\r\n                 \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot compel you to love,\r\n                 But I will not give you your liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJune bugs\xe2\x80\x9d suggests the speech of Katie:[DM]\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\x9cI love you like a little beetle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the speech from _Tannhauser_: \xe2\x80\x9cFor you are wrought with evil\r\npassion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe is living in fear and anxiety about her absent husband. The dread\r\nthat something may happen to him on the journey is expressed in numerous\r\nfancies of the day. A little while before, during the analysis, she had\r\ncome upon a complaint about his \xe2\x80\x9csenility\xe2\x80\x9d in her unconscious thoughts.\r\nThe wish thought which this dream conceals may perhaps best be\r\nconjectured if I say that several days before the dream she was suddenly\r\nastounded by a command which she directed to her husband in the midst of\r\nher work: \xe2\x80\x9c_Go hang yourself_.\xe2\x80\x9d It was found that a few hours before she\r\nhad read somewhere that a vigorous erection is induced when a person is\r\nhanged. It was for the erection which freed itself from repression in\r\nthis terror-inspiring veiled form. \xe2\x80\x9cGo hang yourself\xe2\x80\x9d is as much as to\r\nsay: \xe2\x80\x9cGet up an erection, at any cost.\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Jenkin\xe2\x80\x99s arsenic pills in\r\n_Nabab_ belong in this connection; for it was known to the patient that\r\nthe strongest aphrodisiac, cantharides, is prepared by _crushing bugs_\r\n(so-called Spanish flies). The most important part of the dream content\r\nhas a significance to this effect.\r\n\r\nOpening and shutting the _window_ is the subject of a standing quarrel\r\nwith her husband. She herself likes to sleep with plenty of air, and her\r\nhusband does not. _Exhaustion_ is the chief ailment of which she\r\ncomplains these days.\r\n\r\nIn all three of the dreams just cited I have emphasized by italics those\r\nphrases where one of the elements of the dream recurs in the dream\r\nthoughts in order to make the manifold references of the former obvious.\r\nSince, however, the analysis of none of these dreams has been carried to\r\ncompletion, it will be well worth while to consider a dream with a fully\r\ndetailed analysis, in order to demonstrate the manifold determination of\r\nits content. I select the dream of Irma\xe2\x80\x99s injection for this purpose. We\r\nshall see without effort in this example that the condensation work has\r\nused more than one means for the formation of the dream.\r\n\r\nThe chief person in the content of the dream is my patient Irma, who is\r\nseen with the features which belong to her in waking life, and who\r\ntherefore in the first instance represents herself. But her attitude as\r\nI examine her at the window is taken from the recollection of another\r\nperson, of the lady for whom I should like to exchange my patient, as\r\nthe dream thoughts show. In as far as Irma shows a diphtheritic membrane\r\nwhich recalls my anxiety about my eldest daughter, she comes to\r\nrepresent this child of mine, behind whom is concealed the person of the\r\npatient who died from intoxication and who is brought into connection by\r\nthe identity of her name. In the further course of the dream the\r\nsignificance of Irma\xe2\x80\x99s personality changes (without the alteration of\r\nher image as it is seen in the dream); she becomes one of the children\r\nwhom we examine in the public dispensaries for children\xe2\x80\x99s diseases,\r\nwhere my friends show the difference of their mental capabilities. The\r\ntransference was obviously brought about through the idea of my infant\r\ndaughter. By means of her unwillingness to open her mouth the same Irma\r\nis changed into an allusion to another lady who was once examined by me,\r\nand besides that to my wife, in the same connection. Furthermore, in the\r\nmorbid transformations which I discover in her throat I have gathered\r\nallusions to a great number of other persons.\r\n\r\nAll these people whom I encounter as I follow the associations suggested\r\nby \xe2\x80\x9cIrma,\xe2\x80\x9d do not appear personally in the dream; they are concealed\r\nbehind the dream person \xe2\x80\x9cIrma,\xe2\x80\x9d who is thus developed into a collective\r\nimage, as might be expected, with contradictory features. Irma comes to\r\nrepresent these other persons, who are discarded in the work of\r\ncondensation, in that I cause to happen to her all the things which\r\nrecall these persons detail for detail.\r\n\r\nI may also construct a collective person for the condensation of the\r\ndream in another manner, by uniting the actual features of two or more\r\npersons in one dream image. It is in this manner that Dr. M. in my dream\r\nwas constructed, he bears the name of Dr. M., and speaks and acts as Dr.\r\nM. does, but his bodily characteristics and his suffering belong to\r\nanother person, my eldest brother; a single feature, paleness, is doubly\r\ndetermined, owing to the fact that it is common to both persons. Dr. R.\r\nin my dream about my uncle is a similar composite person. But here the\r\ndream image is prepared in still another manner. I have not united\r\nfeatures peculiar to the one with features of the other, and thereby\r\nabridged the remembered image of each by certain features, but I have\r\nadopted the method employed by Galton in producing family portraits, by\r\nwhich he projects both pictures upon one another, whereupon the common\r\nfeatures stand out in stronger relief, while those which do not coincide\r\nneutralize one another and become obscure in the picture. In the dream\r\nof my uncle the _blond beard_ stands out in relief, as an emphasized\r\nfeature, from the physiognomy, which belongs to two persons, and which\r\nis therefore blurred; furthermore the beard contains an allusion to my\r\nfather and to myself, which is made possible by its reference to the\r\nfact of growing grey.\r\n\r\nThe construction of collective and composite persons is one of the chief\r\nresources of the activity of dream condensation. There will soon be an\r\noccasion for treating of this in another connection.\r\n\r\nThe notion \xe2\x80\x9cdysentery\xe2\x80\x9d in the dream about the injection likewise has a\r\nmanifold determination, on the one hand because of its paraphasic\r\nassonance with diphtheria, and on the other because of its reference to\r\nthe patient, whom I have sent to the Orient, and whose hysteria has been\r\nwrongly recognised.\r\n\r\nThe mention of \xe2\x80\x9cpropyls\xe2\x80\x9d in the dream also proves to be an interesting\r\ncase of condensation. Not \xe2\x80\x9cpropyls\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9camyls\xe2\x80\x9d were contained in the\r\ndream thoughts. One might think that here a simple displacement had\r\noccurred in the dream formation. And this is the case, but the\r\ndisplacement serves the purposes of condensation, as is shown by the\r\nfollowing supplementary analysis. If I dwell for a moment upon the word\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpropyls,\xe2\x80\x9d its assonance to the word \xe2\x80\x9cpropyl\xc3\xa6um\xe2\x80\x9d suggests itself to me.\r\nBut the propyl\xc3\xa6um is to be found not only in Athens but also in Munich.\r\nIn the latter city I visited a friend the year before who was seriously\r\nill, and the reference to him becomes unmistakable on account of\r\n_trimethylamin_, which follows closely upon _propyls_.\r\n\r\nI pass over the striking circumstance that here, as elsewhere in the\r\nanalysis of dreams, associations of the most widely different values are\r\nemployed for the establishment of thought connections as though they\r\nwere equivalent, and I yield to the temptation to regard the process by\r\nwhich _amyls_ in the dream thoughts are replaced by _propyls_, as though\r\nit were plastic in the dream content.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand is the chain of ideas about my friend Otto, who does not\r\nunderstand me, who thinks I am in the wrong, and who gives me the\r\ncordial that smells like amyls; on the other the chain of\r\nideas\xe2\x80\x94connected with the first by contrast\xe2\x80\x94about my friend William, who\r\nunderstands me and who would always think I was in the right, and to\r\nwhom I am indebted for so much valuable information about the chemistry\r\nof the sexual processes.\r\n\r\nThose characteristics of the associations centering about Otto which\r\nought particularly to attract my attention are determined by the recent\r\noccasions which are responsible for the dream; _amyls_ belong to these\r\nelements so determined which are destined to get into the dream content.\r\nThe group of associations \xe2\x80\x9cWilliam\xe2\x80\x9d is distinctly vivified by the\r\ncontrast to Otto, and the elements in it which correspond to those\r\nalready excited in the \xe2\x80\x9cOtto\xe2\x80\x9d associations are thrown into relief. In\r\nthis whole dream I am continually referring to a person who excites my\r\ndispleasure and to another person whom I can oppose to him or her at\r\nwill, and I conjure up the friend as against the enemy, feature for\r\nfeature. Thus amyls in the Otto-group suggests recollections in the\r\nother group belonging to chemistry; trimethylamin, which receives\r\nsupport from several quarters, finds its way into the dream content.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmyls,\xe2\x80\x9d too, might have got into the dream content without undergoing\r\nchange, but it yields to the influence of the \xe2\x80\x9cWilliam\xe2\x80\x9d group of\r\nassociations, owing to the fact that an element which is capable of\r\nfurnishing a double determination for amyls is sought out from the whole\r\nrange of recollections which the name \xe2\x80\x9cWilliam\xe2\x80\x9d covers. The association\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpropyls\xe2\x80\x9d lies in the neighbourhood of _amyls_; Munich with the\r\npropyl\xc3\xa6um comes to meet _amyls_ from the series of associations\r\nbelonging to \xe2\x80\x9cWilliam.\xe2\x80\x9d Both groups are united in _propyls\xe2\x80\x94propyl\xc5\x93um_.\r\nAs though by a compromise, this intermediary element gets into the dream\r\ncontent. Here a _common mean_ which permits of a manifold determination\r\nhas been created. It thus becomes perfectly obvious that manifold\r\ndetermination must facilitate penetration into the dream content. A\r\ndisplacement of attention from what is really intended to something\r\nlying near in the associations has thoughtlessly taken place, for the\r\nsake of this mean-formation.\r\n\r\nThe study of the injection dream has now enabled us to get some insight\r\ninto the process of condensation which takes place in the formation of\r\ndreams. The selection of those elements which occur in the dream content\r\nmore than once, the formation of new unities (collective persons,\r\ncomposite images), and the construction of the common mean, these we\r\nhave been able to recognise as details of the condensing process. The\r\npurpose which is served by condensation and the means by which it is\r\nbrought about will be investigated when we come to study the psychic\r\nprocesses in the formation of dreams as a whole. Let us be content for\r\nthe present with establishing dream _condensation_ as an important\r\nrelation between the dream thoughts and the dream content.\r\n\r\nThe condensing activity of the dream becomes most tangible when it has\r\nselected words and names as its object. In general words are often\r\ntreated as things by the dream, and thus undergo the same combinations,\r\ndisplacements, and substitutions, and therefore also condensations, as\r\nideas of things. The results of such dreams are comical and bizarre word\r\nformations. Upon one occasion when a colleague had sent me one of his\r\nessays, in which he had, in my judgment, overestimated the value of a\r\nrecent physiological discovery and had expressed himself in extravagant\r\nterms, I dreamed the following night a sentence which obviously referred\r\nto this treatise: \xe2\x80\x9c_That is in true norekdal style_.\xe2\x80\x9d The solution of\r\nthis word formation at first gave me difficulties, although it was\r\nunquestionably formed as a parody after the pattern of the superlatives\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccolossal,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpyramidal\xe2\x80\x9d; but to tell where it came from was not easy. At\r\nlast the monster fell apart into the two names Nora and Ekdal from two\r\nwell-known plays by Ibsen. I had previously read a newspaper essay on\r\nIbsen by the same author, whose latest work I was thus criticising in\r\nthe dream.\r\n\r\nII.[DN] One of my female patients dreams that _a man with a light beard\r\nand a peculiar glittering eye is pointing to a sign board attached to a\r\ntree which reads: uclamparia\xe2\x80\x94wet_.\r\n\r\nAnalysis. The man was rather authoritative looking, and his peculiar\r\nglittering eye at once recalled St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Cathedral, near Rome, where\r\nshe saw in mosaics the Popes that have so far ruled. One of the early\r\nPopes had a golden eye (this was really an optical illusion which the\r\nguides usually call attention to). Further associations showed that the\r\ngeneral physiognomy corresponded to her own clergyman (Pope), and the\r\nshape of the light beard recalled her doctor (myself), while the stature\r\nof the man in the dream recalled her father. All these persons stand in\r\nthe same relation to her; they are all guiding and directing her course\r\nof life. On further questioning, the golden eye recalled gold\xe2\x80\x94money\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nrather expensive psychoanalytic treatment which gives her a great deal\r\nof concern. Gold, moreover, recalls the gold cure for alcoholism\xe2\x80\x94Mr. D.,\r\nwhom she would have married if it had not been for his clinging to the\r\ndisgusting alcohol habit\xe2\x80\x94she does not object to a person taking an\r\noccasional drink; she herself sometimes drinks beer and cordials\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nagain brings her back to her visit to St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s without the walls and\r\nits surroundings. She remembers that in the neighbouring monastery of\r\nthe Three Fountains she drank a liquor made of eucalyptus by the\r\nTrappist monks who inhabit this monastery. She then relates how the\r\nmonks transformed this malarial and swampy region into a dry and\r\nhealthful neighbourhood by planting there many eucalyptus trees. The\r\nword \xe2\x80\x9cuclamparia\xe2\x80\x9d then resolves itself into eucalyptus and malaria, and\r\nthe word \xe2\x80\x9cwet\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the former swampy nature of the place. Wet also\r\nsuggests dry. Dry is actually the name of the man whom she would have\r\nmarried except for his over-indulgence in alcohol. The peculiar name of\r\nDry is of Germanic origin (drei = three) and hence alludes to the Abbey\r\nof the Three (drei) Fountains above mentioned. In talking about Mr.\r\nDry\xe2\x80\x99s habit she used the strong words, \xe2\x80\x9cHe could drink a fountain.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nDry jocosely refers to his habit by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I must drink\r\nbecause I am always _dry_\xe2\x80\x9d (referring to his name). The eucalyptus also\r\nrefers to her neurosis, which was at first diagnosed as malaria. She\r\nwent to Italy because her attacks of anxiety, which were accompanied by\r\nmarked trembling and shivering, were thought to be of malarial origin.\r\nShe bought some eucalyptus oil from the monks, and she maintains that it\r\nhas done her much good.\r\n\r\nThe condensation _uclamparia\xe2\x80\x94wet_ is therefore the point of junction for\r\nthe dream as well as for the neurosis.[DO]\r\n\r\nIII. In a somewhat long and wild dream of my own, the chief point of\r\nwhich is apparently a sea voyage, it happens that the next landing is\r\ncalled _Hearsing_ and the one farther on _Fliess_. The latter is the\r\nname of my friend living in B., who has often been the objective point\r\nof my travels. But Hearsing is put together from the names of places in\r\nthe local environment of Vienna, which so often end in _ing_:\r\n_Hietzing_, _Liesing_, _Moedling_ (Medelitz, \xe2\x80\x9cme\xc3\xa6 delici\xc3\xa6,\xe2\x80\x9d my own name,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_my joy_\xe2\x80\x9d) (joy = German Freude), and the English _hearsay_, which\r\npoints to libel and establishes the relation to the indifferent dream\r\nexcitement of the day\xe2\x80\x94a poem in the _Fliegende Blaetter_ about a\r\nslanderous dwarf, \xe2\x80\x9cSaidhe Hashesaid.\xe2\x80\x9d By connecting the final syllable\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_ing_\xe2\x80\x9d with the name _Fliess_, \xe2\x80\x9c_Vlissingen_\xe2\x80\x9d is obtained, which is a\r\nreal port on the sea-voyage which my brother passes when he comes to\r\nvisit us from England. But the English for _Vlissingen_ is _Flushing_,\r\nwhich signifies blushing and recalls erythrophobia (fear of blushing),\r\nwhich I treat, and also reminds me of a recent publication by Bechterew\r\nabout this neurosis, which has given occasion for angry feelings in me.\r\n\r\nIV. Upon another occasion I had a dream which consisted of two parts.\r\nThe first was the vividly remembered word \xe2\x80\x9cAutodidasker,\xe2\x80\x9d the second was\r\ntruthfully covered by a short and harmless fancy which had been\r\ndeveloped a few days before, and which was to the effect that I must\r\ntell Professor N., when I saw him next: \xe2\x80\x9cThe patient about whose\r\ncondition I last consulted you is really suffering from a neurosis, just\r\nas you suspected.\xe2\x80\x9d The coinage \xe2\x80\x9c_Autodidasker_\xe2\x80\x9d must, then, not only\r\nsatisfy the requirement that it should contain or represent a compressed\r\nmeaning, but also that this meaning should have a valid connection with\r\nmy purpose, which is repeated from waking life, of giving Professor N.\r\nhis due credit.\r\n\r\nNow _Autodidasker_ is easily separated into _author_ (German _Autor_),\r\n_autodidact_, and _Lasker_, with whom is associated the name Lasalle.\r\nThe first of these words leads to the occasion of the dream\xe2\x80\x94which this\r\ntime is significant. I had brought home to my wife several volumes by a\r\nwell-known author, who is a friend of my brother\xe2\x80\x99s, and who, as I have\r\nlearned, comes from the same town as I (J. J. David). One evening she\r\nspoke to me about the profound impression which the touching sadness of\r\na story in one of David\xe2\x80\x99s novels, about a talented but degenerate\r\nperson, had made upon her, and our conversation turned upon the\r\nindications of talent which we perceive in our own children. Under the\r\ninfluence of what she had just read, my wife expressed a concern\r\nrelative to our children, and I comforted her with the remark that it is\r\njust such dangers that can be averted by education. During the night my\r\ntrain of thoughts proceeded further, took up the concern of my wife, and\r\nconnected with it all sorts of other things. An opinion which the poet\r\nhad expressed to my brother upon the subject of marriage showed my\r\nthoughts a by-path which might lead to a representation in the dream.\r\nThis path led to Breslau, into which city a lady who was a very good\r\nfriend of ours had married. I found in Breslau Lasker and Lasalle as\r\nexamples realising our concern about being ruined at the hands of a\r\nwoman, examples which enabled me to represent both manifestations of\r\nthis influence for the bad at once.[DP] The \xe2\x80\x9cCherchez la femme,\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\nwhich these thoughts may be summed up, when taken in another sense,\r\nbrings me to my brother, who is still unmarried and whose name is\r\nAlexander. Now I see that Alex, as we abbreviate the name, sounds almost\r\nlike inversion of Lasker and that this factor must have taken part in\r\ngiving my thoughts their detour by way of Breslau.\r\n\r\nBut this playing with names and syllables in which I am here engaged\r\ncontains still another meaning. The wish that my brother may have a\r\nhappy family life is represented by it in the following manner. In the\r\nartistic romance _L\xe2\x80\x99\xc5\x92uvre_, the writer, as is well known, has\r\nincidentally given an episodic account of himself and of his own family\r\nhappiness, and he appears under the name of _Sandoz_. Probably he has\r\ntaken the following course in the name transformation. _Zola_ when\r\ninverted (as children like so much to do) gives _Aloz_. But that was\r\nstill too undisguised for him; therefore he replaced the syllable _Al_,\r\nwhich stands at the beginning of the name Alexander, by the third\r\nsyllable of the same name, _sand_, and thus _Sandoz_ came about. In a\r\nsimilar manner my _autodidasker_ originated.\r\n\r\nMy fancy, that I am telling Professor N. that the patient whom we had\r\nboth seen is suffering from a neurosis, got into the dream in the\r\nfollowing manner. Shortly before the close of my working year I received\r\na patient in whose case my diagnosis failed me. A serious organic\r\naffliction\xe2\x80\x94perhaps some changes in the spine\xe2\x80\x94was to be assumed, but\r\ncould not be proved. It would have been tempting to diagnose the trouble\r\nas a neurosis, and this would have put an end to all difficulties, had\r\nit not been for the fact that the sexual anamnesis, without which I am\r\nunwilling to admit a neurosis, was so energetically denied by the\r\npatient. In my embarrassment I called to my assistance the physician\r\nwhom I respect most of all men (as others do also), and to whose\r\nauthority I surrender most completely. He listened to my doubts, told me\r\nhe thought them justified, and then said: \xe2\x80\x9cKeep on observing the man, it\r\nis probably a neurosis.\xe2\x80\x9d Since I know that he does not share my opinions\r\nabout the etiology of neuroses, I suppressed my disagreement, but I did\r\nnot conceal my scepticism. A few days after I informed the patient that\r\nI did not know what to do with him, and advised him to go to some one\r\nelse. Thereupon, to my great astonishment, he began to beg my pardon for\r\nhaving lied to me, saying that he had felt very much ashamed; and now he\r\nrevealed to me just that piece of sexual etiology which I had expected,\r\nand which I found necessary for assuming the existence of a neurosis.\r\nThis was a relief to me, but at the same time a humiliation; for I had\r\nto admit that my consultant, who was not disconcerted by the absence of\r\nanamnesis, had made a correct observation. I made up my mind to tell him\r\nabout it when I saw him again, and to say to him that he had been in the\r\nright and I in the wrong.\r\n\r\nThis is just what I do in the dream. But what sort of a wish is supposed\r\nto be fulfilled if I acknowledge that I am in the wrong? This is exactly\r\nmy wish; I wish to be in the wrong with my apprehensions\xe2\x80\x94that is to say,\r\nI wish that my wife whose fears I have appropriated in the dream\r\nthoughts may remain in the wrong. The subject to which the matter of\r\nbeing in the right or in the wrong is related in the dream is not far\r\ndistant from what is really interesting to the dream thoughts. It is the\r\nsame pair of alternatives of either organic or functional impairment\r\nthrough a woman, more properly through the sexual life\xe2\x80\x94either tabetic\r\nparalysis or a neurosis\xe2\x80\x94with which the manner of Lasalle\xe2\x80\x99s ruin is more\r\nor less loosely connected.\r\n\r\nIn this well-joined dream (which, however, is quite transparent with the\r\nhelp of careful analysis) Professor N. plays a part not merely on\r\naccount of this analogy and of my wish to remain in the wrong, or on\r\naccount of the associated references to Breslau and to the family of our\r\nfriend who is married there\xe2\x80\x94but also on account of the following little\r\noccurrence which was connected with our consultation. After he had\r\nattended to our medical task by giving the above mentioned suggestion,\r\nhis interest was directed to personal matters. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many children have\r\nyou now?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSix.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94A gesture of respect and reflection.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGirls,\r\nboys?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThree of each. They are my pride and my treasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there\r\nis no difficulty about the girls, but the boys give trouble later on in\r\ntheir education.\xe2\x80\x9d I replied that until now they had been very tractable;\r\nthis second diagnosis concerning the future of my boys of course pleased\r\nme as little as the one he had made earlier, namely, that my patient had\r\nonly a neurosis. These two impressions, then, are bound together by\r\ncontiguity, by being successively received, and if I incorporate the\r\nstory of the neurosis into the dream, I substitute it for the\r\nconversation upon education which shows itself to be even more closely\r\nconnected with the dream thoughts owing to the fact that it has such an\r\nintimate bearing upon the subsequently expressed concerns of my wife.\r\nThus even my fear that N. may turn out to be right in his remarks on the\r\neducational difficulties in the case of boys is admitted into the dream\r\ncontent, in that it is concealed behind the representation of my wish\r\nthat I may be wrong in such apprehensions. The same fancy serves without\r\nchange to represent both conflicting alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe verbal compositions of the dream are very similar to those which are\r\nknown to occur in paranoia, but which are also found in hysteria and in\r\ncompulsive ideas. The linguistic habits of children, who at certain\r\nperiods actually treat words as objects and invent new languages and\r\nartificial syntaxes, are in this case the common source for the dream as\r\nwell as for psychoneuroses.\r\n\r\nWhen speeches occur in the dream, which are expressly distinguished from\r\nthoughts as such, it is an invariable rule that the dream speech has\r\noriginated from a remembered speech in the dream material. Either the\r\nwording has been preserved in its integrity, or it has been slightly\r\nchanged in the course of expression; frequently the dream speech is\r\npieced together from various recollections of speeches, while the\r\nwording has remained the same and the meaning has possibly been changed\r\nso as to have two or more significations. Not infrequently the dream\r\nspeech serves merely as an allusion to an incident, at which the\r\nrecollected speech occurred.[DQ]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    (_b_) _The Work of Displacement_\r\n\r\nAnother sort of relation, which is no less significant, must have come\r\nto our notice while we were collecting examples of dream condensation.\r\nWe have seen that those elements which obtrude themselves in the dream\r\ncontent as its essential components play a part in the dream thoughts\r\nwhich is by no means the same. As a correlative to this the converse of\r\nthis thesis is also true. That which is clearly the essential thing in\r\nthe dream thoughts need not be represented in the dream at all. The\r\ndream, as it were, is _eccentric_; its contents are grouped about other\r\nelements than the dream thoughts as a central point. Thus, for example,\r\nin the dream about the botanical monograph the central point of the\r\ndream content is apparently the element \xe2\x80\x9cbotanical\xe2\x80\x9d; in the dream\r\nthoughts we are concerned with the complications and conflicts which\r\nresult from services rendered among colleagues which put them under\r\nobligations to one another, subsequently with the reproach that I am in\r\nthe habit of sacrificing too much to my hobbies, and the element\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbotanical\xe2\x80\x9d would in no case find a place in this nucleus of the dream\r\nthoughts if it were not loosely connected with it by an antithesis, for\r\nbotany was never among my favourite studies. In the Sappho dream of my\r\npatient the ascending and descending, being upstairs and down, is made\r\nthe central point; the dream, however, is concerned with the danger of\r\nsexual relations with persons of low _degree_, so that only one of the\r\nelements of the dream thoughts seems to have been taken over into the\r\ndream content, albeit with unseemly elaboration. Similarly in the dream\r\nabout June bugs, whose subject is the relation of sexuality to cruelty,\r\nthe factor of cruelty has indeed reappeared but in a different\r\nconnection and without the mention of the sexual, that is to say, it has\r\nbeen torn from its context and transformed into something strange.\r\nAgain, in the dream about my uncle, the blond beard, which seems to be\r\nits central point, appears to have no rational connection with the\r\nwishes for greatness which we have recognised as the nucleus of the\r\ndream thoughts. It is only to be expected if such dreams give a\r\ndisplaced impression. In complete contrast to these examples, the dream\r\nof Irma\xe2\x80\x99s injection shows that individual elements can claim the same\r\nplace in the formation of dreams which they occupy in the dream\r\nthoughts. The recognition of these new and entirely variable relations\r\nbetween the dream thoughts and the dream content is at first likely to\r\nexcite our astonishment. If we find in a psychic process of normal life\r\nthat an idea has been culled from among a number of others, and has\r\nacquired particular vividness in our consciousness, we are in the habit\r\nof regarding this result as a proof that the victorious idea is endowed\r\nwith a peculiarly high degree of psychic value\xe2\x80\x94a certain degree of\r\ninterest. We now discover that this value of the individual elements in\r\nthe dream thoughts is not preserved in the formation of the dream, or\r\ndoes not come into consideration. For there is no doubt as to the\r\nelements of the dream thoughts which are of the highest value; our\r\njudgment tells us immediately. In the formation of dreams those elements\r\nwhich are emphasized with intense interest may be treated as though they\r\nwere inferior, and other elements are put in their place which certainly\r\nwere inferior in the dream thoughts. We are at first given the\r\nimpression that the psychic intensity[DR] of the individual ideas does\r\nnot come into consideration at all for the selection made by the dream,\r\nbut only their greater or smaller multiplicity of determination. Not\r\nwhat is important in the dream thoughts gets into the dream, but what is\r\ncontained in them several times over, one might be inclined to think;\r\nbut our understanding of the formation of dreams is not much furthered\r\nby this assumption, for at the outset it will be impossible to believe\r\nthat the two factors of manifold determination and of integral value do\r\nnot tend in the same direction in the influence they exert on the\r\nselection made by the dream. Those ideas in the dream thoughts which are\r\nmost important are probably also those which recur most frequently, for\r\nthe individual dream thoughts radiate from them as from central points.\r\nAnd still the dream may reject those elements which are especially\r\nemphasized and which receive manifold support, and may take up into its\r\ncontent elements which are endowed only with the latter property.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty may be solved by considering another impression received\r\nin the investigation of the manifold determination of the dream content.\r\nPerhaps many a reader has already passed his own judgment upon this\r\ninvestigation by saying that the manifold determination of the elements\r\nof the dream is not a significant discovery, because it is a\r\nself-evident one. In the analysis one starts from the dream elements,\r\nand registers all the notions which are connected with them; it is no\r\nwonder, then, that these elements should occur with particular frequency\r\nin the thought material which is obtained in this manner. I cannot\r\nacknowledge the validity of this objection, but shall say something\r\nmyself which sounds like it. Among the thoughts which analysis brings to\r\nlight, many can be found which are far removed from the central idea of\r\nthe dream, and which appear distinguished from the rest as artificial\r\ninterpolations for a definite purpose. Their purpose may easily be\r\ndiscovered; they are just the ones which establish a connection, often a\r\nforced and far-fetched one, between the dream content and the dream\r\nthoughts, and if these elements were to be weeded out, not only\r\nover-determination but also a sufficient determination by means of the\r\ndream thoughts would often be lacking for the dream content. We are thus\r\nled to the conclusion that manifold determination, which decides the\r\nselection made by the dream, is perhaps not always a primary factor in\r\ndream formation, but is often the secondary manifestation of a psychic\r\npower which is still unknown to us. But in spite of all this, manifold\r\ndetermination must nevertheless control the entrance of individual\r\nelements into the dream, for it is possible to observe that it is\r\nestablished with considerable effort in cases where it does not result\r\nfrom the dream material without assistance.\r\n\r\nThe assumption is not now far distant that a psychic force is expressed\r\nin dream activity which on the one hand strips elements of high psychic\r\nvalue of their intensity, and which on the other hand creates new\r\nvalues, _by way of over-determination_, from elements of small value,\r\nthese new values subsequently getting into the dream content. If this is\r\nthe method of procedure, there has taken place in the formation of the\r\ndream a transference and displacement of the psychic intensities of the\r\nindividual elements, of which the textual difference between the dream\r\nand the thought content appears as a result. The process which we assume\r\nhere is nothing less than the essential part of the dream activity; it\r\nmerits the designation of _dream displacement_. _Dream displacement_ and\r\n_dream condensation_ are the two craftsmen to whom we may chiefly\r\nattribute the moulding of the dream.\r\n\r\nI think we also have an easy task in recognising the psychic force which\r\nmakes itself felt in the circumstances of dream displacement. The result\r\nof this displacement is that the dream content no longer resembles the\r\ncore of the dream thoughts at all, and that the dream reproduces only a\r\ndisfigured form of the dream-wish in the unconscious. But we are already\r\nacquainted with dream disfigurement; we have traced it back to the\r\ncensorship which one psychic instance in the psychic life exercises upon\r\nthe other. Dream displacement is one of the chief means for achieving\r\nthis disfigurement. _Is fecit, cui profuit._ We may assume that dream\r\ndisplacement is brought about by the influence of this censor, of the\r\nendopsychic repulsion.[DS]\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the factors of displacement, condensation, and\r\nover-determination play into one another in the formation of the dream,\r\nwhich is the ruling factor and which the subordinate one, all this will\r\nbe reserved as the subject of later investigations. For the present we\r\nmay state, as a second condition which the elements must satisfy in\r\norder to get into the dream, that _they must be withdrawn from the\r\ncensor of resistance_. From now on we shall take account of dream\r\ndisplacement as an unquestionable fact in the interpretation of dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n              (_c_) _Means of Representation in the Dream_\r\n\r\nBesides the two factors of dream condensation and dream displacement\r\nwhich we have found to be active in the transformation of the latent\r\ndream material into the manifest content, we shall come in the course of\r\nthis investigation upon two other conditions which exercise an\r\nunquestionable influence upon the selection of the material which gets\r\ninto the dream. Even at the risk of seeming to stop our progress, I\r\nshould like to glance at the processes by which the interpretation of\r\ndreams is accomplished. I do not deny that I should succeed best in\r\nmaking them clear, and in showing that they are sufficiently reliable to\r\ninsure them against attack, by taking a single dream as a paradigm and\r\ndeveloping its interpretation, as I have done in Chapter II. in the\r\ndream of \xe2\x80\x9cIrma\xe2\x80\x99s Injection,\xe2\x80\x9d and then putting together the dream\r\nthoughts which I have discovered, and reconstructing the formation of\r\nthe dream from them\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, by supplementing the analysis of\r\ndreams by a synthesis of them. I have accomplished this with several\r\nspecimens for my own instruction; but I cannot undertake to do it here\r\nbecause I am prevented by considerations, which every right-minded\r\nperson must approve of, relative to the psychic material necessary for\r\nsuch a demonstration. In the analysis of dreams these considerations\r\npresent less difficulty, for an analysis may be incomplete and still\r\nretain its value even if it leads only a short way into the thought\r\nlabyrinth of the dream. I do not see how a synthesis could be anything\r\nshort of complete in order to be convincing. I could give a complete\r\nsynthesis only of the dreams of such persons as are unknown to the\r\nreading public. Since, however, only neurotic patients furnish me with\r\nthe means for doing this, this part of the description of the dream must\r\nbe postponed until I can carry the psychological explanation of neuroses\r\nfar enough\xe2\x80\x94elsewhere\xe2\x80\x94to be able to show their connection with the\r\nsubject matter under consideration.[DT]\r\n\r\nFrom my attempts synthetically to construct dreams from the dream\r\nthoughts, I know that the material which is obtained from interpretation\r\nvaries in value. For a part of it consists of the essential dream\r\nthoughts which would, therefore, completely replace the dream, and which\r\nwould in themselves be sufficient for this replacement if there were no\r\ncensor for the dream. The other part may be summed up under the term\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccollaterals\xe2\x80\x9d; taken as a whole they represent the means by which the\r\nreal wish that arises from the dream thoughts is transformed into the\r\ndream-wish. A first part of these \xe2\x80\x9ccollaterals\xe2\x80\x9d consists of allusions to\r\nthe actual dream thoughts, which, considered schematically, correspond\r\nto displacements from the essential to the non-essential. A second part\r\ncomprises the thoughts which connect these non-essential elements, that\r\nhave become significant through displacement with one another, and which\r\nreach from them into the dream content. Finally a third part contains\r\nthe ideas and thought connections which (in the work of interpretation)\r\nconduct us from the dream content to the intermediary collaterals, _all\r\nof which_ need not _necessarily_ have participated in the formation of\r\nthe dream.\r\n\r\nAt this point we are interested exclusively in the essential dream\r\nthoughts. These are usually found to be a complex of thoughts and\r\nmemories of the most intricate possible construction, and to possess all\r\nthe properties of the thought processes which are known to us from\r\nwaking life. Not infrequently they are trains of thought which proceed\r\nfrom more than one centre, but which do not lack points of connection;\r\nalmost regularly a chain of thought stands next to its contradictory\r\ncorrelative, being connected with it by contrast associations.\r\n\r\nThe individual parts of this complicated structure naturally stand in\r\nthe most manifold logical relations to one another. They constitute a\r\nforeground or background, digressions, illustrations, conditions, chains\r\nof argument, and objections. When the whole mass of these dream thoughts\r\nis subjected to the pressure of the dream activity, during which the\r\nparts are turned about, broken up, and pushed together, something like\r\ndrifting ice, there arises the question, what becomes of the logical\r\nties which until now had given form to the structure? What\r\nrepresentation do \xe2\x80\x9cif,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbecause,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cas though,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9calthough,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ceither\xe2\x80\x94or,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand all the other conjunctions, without which we cannot understand a\r\nphrase or a sentence, receive in the dream?\r\n\r\nAt first we must answer that the dream has at its disposal no means for\r\nrepresenting these logical relations among the dream thoughts. In most\r\ncases it disregards all these conjunctions, and undertakes the\r\nelaboration only of the objective content of the dream thoughts. It is\r\nleft to the interpretation of the dream to restore the coherence which\r\nthe activity of the dream has destroyed.\r\n\r\nIf the dream lacks ability to express these relations, the psychic\r\nmaterial of which the dream is wrought must be responsible. The\r\ndescriptive arts are limited in the same manner\xe2\x80\x94painting and the plastic\r\narts in comparison with poetry, which can employ speech; and here too\r\nthe reason for this impotence is to be found in the material in the\r\ntreatment of which the two arts strive to give expression to something.\r\nBefore the art of painting had arrived at an understanding of the laws\r\nof expression by which it is bound, it attempted to escape this\r\ndisadvantage. In old paintings little tags were hung from the mouths of\r\nthe persons represented giving the speech, the expression of which in\r\nthe picture the artist despaired of.\r\n\r\nPerhaps an objection will here be raised challenging the assertion that\r\nthe dream dispenses with the representation of logical relations. There\r\nare dreams in which the most complicated intellectual operations take\r\nplace, in which proof and refutation are offered, puns and comparisons\r\nmade, just as in waking thoughts. But here, too, appearances are\r\ndeceitful; if the interpretation of such dreams is pursued, it is found\r\nthat all of this is _dream material, not the representation of\r\nintellectual activity in the dream_. The _content_ of the dream thoughts\r\nis reproduced by the apparent thinking of the dream, not _the relations\r\nof the dream thoughts to one another_, in the determination of which\r\nrelations thinking consists. I shall give examples of this. But the\r\nthesis which is most easily established is that all speeches which occur\r\nin the dream, and which are expressly designated as such, are unchanged\r\nor only slightly modified copies of speeches which are likewise to be\r\nfound in the recollections of the dream material. Often the speech is\r\nonly an allusion to an event contained in the dream thoughts; the\r\nmeaning of the dream is a quite different one.\r\n\r\nI shall not deny, indeed, that there is also critical thought activity\r\nwhich does not merely repeat material from the dream thoughts and which\r\ntakes part in the formation of the dream. I shall have to explain the\r\ninfluence of this factor at the close of this discussion. It will then\r\nbecome clear that this thought activity is evoked not by the dream\r\nthoughts, but by the dream itself after it is already finished in a\r\ncertain sense.\r\n\r\nWe shall, therefore, consider it settled for the present that the\r\nlogical relations among the dream thoughts do not enjoy any particular\r\nrepresentation in the dream. For instance, where there is a\r\ncontradiction in the dream, this is either a contradiction directed\r\nagainst the dream itself or a contradiction derived from the content of\r\none of the dream thoughts; a contradiction in the dream corresponds to a\r\ncontradiction _among_ the dream thoughts only in a highly indirect\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nBut just as the art of painting finally succeeded in depicting in the\r\nrepresented persons, at least their intention in speaking\xe2\x80\x94their\r\ntenderness, threatening attitude, warning mien, and the like\xe2\x80\x94by other\r\nmeans than the dangling tag, so also the dream has found it possible to\r\nrender account of a few of the logical relations among its dream\r\nthoughts by means of an appropriate modification of the peculiar method\r\nof dream representation. It will be found by experience that different\r\ndreams go to different lengths in taking this into consideration; while\r\none dream entirely disregards the logical coherence of its material,\r\nanother attempts to indicate it as completely as possible. In so doing\r\nthe dream departs more or less widely from the subject-matter which it\r\nis to elaborate. The dream also takes a similarly varying attitude\r\ntowards the temporal coherence of the dream thoughts, if such coherence\r\nhas been established in the unconscious (as for example in the dream of\r\nIrma\xe2\x80\x99s injection).\r\n\r\nBut what are the means by which the dream activity is enabled to\r\nindicate these relations in the dream material which are so difficult to\r\nrepresent? I shall attempt to enumerate these separately.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the dream renders account of the connection which is\r\nundeniably present between all the parts of the dream thoughts by\r\nuniting this material in a single composition as a situation or process.\r\nIt reproduces _logical connection in the form of simultaneousness_; in\r\nthis case it acts something like the painter who groups together all the\r\nphilosophers or poets into a picture of the school of Athens or of\r\nParnassus, although these were never at once present in any hall or on\r\nany mountain top\xe2\x80\x94though they do, however, form a unity from the point of\r\nview of reflective contemplation.\r\n\r\nThe dream carries out this method of representation in detail. Whenever\r\nit shows two elements close together, it vouches for a particularly\r\nintimate connection between those elements which correspond to them in\r\nthe dream thoughts. It is as in our method of writing: _to_ signifies\r\nthat the two letters are to be pronounced as one syllable, while _t_\r\nwith _o_ after a free space shows that _t_ is the last letter of one\r\nword and _o_ the first letter of another. According to this, dream\r\ncombinations are not made of arbitrary, completely incongruent elements\r\nof the dream material, but of elements that also have a somewhat\r\nintimate relation to one another in the dream thoughts.\r\n\r\nFor representing causal relation the dream has two methods, which are\r\nessentially reducible to one. The more frequent method, in cases, for\r\nexample, where the dream thoughts are to the effect: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause this was\r\nso and so, this and that must happen,\xe2\x80\x9d consists in making the premise an\r\nintroductory dream and joining the conclusion to it in the form of the\r\nmain dream. If my interpretation is correct, the sequence may also be\r\nreversed. That part of the dream which is more completely worked out\r\nalways corresponds to the conclusion.\r\n\r\nA female patient, whose dream I shall later give in full, once furnished\r\nme with a neat example of such a representation of causal relationship.\r\nThe dream consisted of a short prologue and of a very elaborate but well\r\norganised dream composition, which might be entitled: \xe2\x80\x9cA flower of\r\nspeech.\xe2\x80\x9d The prologue of the dream is as follows: _She goes to the two\r\nmaids in the kitchen and scolds them for taking so long to prepare \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nlittle bite of food.\xe2\x80\x9d She also sees a great many coarse dishes standing\r\nin the kitchen, inverted so that the water may drop off them, and heaped\r\nup in a pile. The two maids go to fetch water, and must, as it were,\r\nstep into a river, which reaches up to the house or into the yard._\r\n\r\nThen follows the main dream, which begins as follows: _She is descending\r\nfrom a high place, over balustrades that are curiously fashioned, and\r\nshe is glad that her dress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get caught anywhere_, &c. Now the\r\nintroductory dream refers to the house of the lady\xe2\x80\x99s parents. Probably\r\nshe has often heard from her mother the words which are spoken in the\r\nkitchen. The piles of unwashed dishes are taken from an unpretentious\r\nearthenware shop which was located in the same house. The second part of\r\nthis dream contains an allusion to the dreamer\xe2\x80\x99s father, who always had\r\na great deal to do with servant girls, and who later contracted a fatal\r\ndisease during a flood\xe2\x80\x94the house stood near the bank of a river. The\r\nthought which is concealed behind the introductory dream, then, is to\r\nthis effect: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I was born in this house, under such limited and\r\nunlovely circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d The main dream takes up the same thought, and\r\npresents it in a form that has been altered by the tendency to\r\nwish-fulfilment: \xe2\x80\x9cI am of exalted origin.\xe2\x80\x9d Properly then: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I was\r\nborn in such low circumstances, my career has been so and so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see, the partition of a dream into two unequal portions\r\ndoes not always signify a causal relation between the thoughts of the\r\ntwo portions. It often appears as though the same material were being\r\npresented in the two dreams from different points of view; or as though\r\nthe two dreams have proceeded from two separated centres in the dream\r\nmaterial and their contents overlap, so that the object which is the\r\ncentre of one dream has served in the other as an allusion, and _vice\r\nversa_. But in a certain number of cases a division into shorter\r\nfore-dreams and longer subsequent dreams actually signifies a causal\r\nrelation between the two portions. The other method of representing\r\ncausal relation is used with less abundant material and consists in the\r\nchange of one image in the dream, whether a person or a thing, into\r\nanother. It is only in cases where we witness this change taking place\r\nin the dream that any causal relation is asserted to exist, not where we\r\nmerely notice that one thing has taken the place of another. I said that\r\nboth methods of representing causal relation are reducible to the same\r\nthing; in both cases _causation_ is represented by a _succession_, now\r\nby the sequence of the dreams, now by the immediate transformation of\r\none image into another. In the great majority of cases, of course,\r\ncausal relation is not expressed at all, but is obliterated by the\r\nsequence of elements which is unavoidable in the dream process.\r\n\r\nThe dream is altogether unable to express the alternative, \xe2\x80\x9ceither\xe2\x80\x94or\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nit is in the habit of taking both members of this alternative into one\r\ncontext, as though they were equally privileged. A classic example of\r\nthis is contained in the dream of Irma\xe2\x80\x99s injection. Its latent thoughts\r\nobviously mean: I am innocent of the continued presence of Irma\xe2\x80\x99s pains;\r\nthe fault rests either with her resistance to accepting the solution,\r\n_or_ with the fact that she is living under unfavourable sexual\r\nconditions, which I am unable to change, _or_ her pains are not of a\r\nhysteric nature at all, but organic. The dream, however, fulfils all\r\nthese possibilities, which are almost exclusive, and is quite ready to\r\nextract from the dream-wish an additional fourth solution of this kind.\r\nAfter interpreting the dream I have therefore inserted the _either\xe2\x80\x94or_\r\nin the sequence of the dream thoughts.\r\n\r\nIn the case where the dreamer finds occasion in telling the dream to use\r\n_either\xe2\x80\x94or_: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was either a garden or a living-room,\xe2\x80\x9d &c., it is not\r\nreally an alternative which occurs in the dream thoughts, but an \xe2\x80\x9cand,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\na simple addition. When we use _either\xe2\x80\x94or_ we are usually describing a\r\ncharacteristic of indistinctness belonging to an element of the dream\r\nwhich is still capable of being cleared up. The rule of interpretation\r\nfor this case is as follows: The separate members of the alternative are\r\nto be treated as equals and connected by \xe2\x80\x9cand.\xe2\x80\x9d For instance, after\r\nwaiting for a long time in vain for the address of my friend who is\r\nliving in Italy, I dream that I receive a telegram which tells me this\r\naddress. Upon the strip of telegraph paper I see printed in blue the\r\nfollowing; the first word is blurred:\r\n\r\n  perhaps _via_,\r\n  or _villa_, the second is distinctly: _Sezerno_ or perhaps (_Casa_).\r\n\r\nThe second word, which sounds like an Italian name and which reminds me\r\nof our etymological discussions, also expresses my displeasure on\r\naccount of the fact that my friend has kept his place of residence\r\nsecret from me for so long a time; every member of the triple suggestion\r\nfor the first word may be recognised in the course of analysis as a\r\nself-sufficient and equally well-justified starting point in the\r\nconcatenation of ideas.\r\n\r\nDuring the night before the funeral of my father I dreamed of a printed\r\nplacard, a card or poster\xe2\x80\x94perhaps something like signs in railway\r\nwaiting-rooms which announce the prohibition of smoking\xe2\x80\x94which reads\r\neither:\r\n\r\n                   _It is requested to shut the eyes_\r\n                                   or\r\n                   _It is requested to shut an eye_\r\n\r\nwhich I am in the habit of representing in the following form:\r\n\r\n                                         _the_\r\n               _It is requested to shut_       _eye(s)._\r\n                                         _an_\r\n\r\nEach of the two variations has its own particular meaning, and leads us\r\nalong particular paths in the interpretation of the dream. I had made\r\nthe simplest kind of funeral arrangements, for I knew how the deceased\r\nthought about such matters. Other members of the family, however, did\r\nnot approve of such puritanic simplicity; they thought we would have to\r\nbe ashamed before the mourners. Hence one of the wordings of the dream\r\nrequests the \xe2\x80\x9cshutting of one eye,\xe2\x80\x9d that is to say, that people should\r\nshow consideration. The significance of the blurring, which we describe\r\nwith an _either\xe2\x80\x94or_, may here be seen with particular ease. The dream\r\nactivity has not succeeded in constructing a unified but at the same\r\ntime ambiguous wording for the dream thoughts. Thus the two main trains\r\nof thought are already distinguished even in the dream content.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases the division of the dream into two equal parts expresses\r\nthe alternative which the dream finds it so difficult to represent.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the dream towards the category of antithesis and\r\ncontradiction is most striking. This category is unceremoniously\r\nneglected; the word \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d does not seem to exist for the dream.\r\nAntitheses are with peculiar preference reduced to unity or represented\r\nas one. The dream also takes the liberty of representing any element\r\nwhatever by its desired opposite, so that it is at first impossible to\r\ntell about any element capable of having an opposite, whether it is to\r\nbe taken negatively or positively, in the dream thoughts.[DU] In one of\r\nthe last-mentioned dreams, whose introductory portion we have already\r\ninterpreted (\xe2\x80\x9cbecause my parentage is such\xe2\x80\x9d), the dreamer descends over\r\na balustrade and holds a blossoming twig in her hands. Since this\r\npicture suggests to her the angel in paintings of the Annunciation (her\r\nown name is Mary) carrying a lily stem in his hand, and the white-robed\r\ngirls marching in the procession on Corpus Christi Day when the streets\r\nare decorated with green bows, the blossoming twig in the dream is very\r\ncertainly an allusion to sexual innocence. But the twig is thickly\r\nstudded with red blossoms, each one of which resembles a camelia. At the\r\nend of her walk, so the dream continues, the blossoms have already\r\nfallen considerably apart; then unmistakable allusions to menstruation\r\nfollow. But this very twig which is carried like a lily and as though by\r\nan innocent girl, is also an allusion to Camille, who, as is known,\r\nalways wore a white camelia, but a red one at the time of her\r\nmenstruation. The same blossoming twig (\xe2\x80\x9cthe flower of maidenhood\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\nthe songs about the miller\xe2\x80\x99s daughter by Goethe) represents at once\r\nsexual innocence and its opposite. The same dream, also, which expresses\r\nthe dreamer\xe2\x80\x99s joy at having succeeded in passing through life unsullied,\r\nhints in several places (as at the falling-off of the blossom), at the\r\nopposite train of thought\xe2\x80\x94namely, that she had been guilty of various\r\nsins against sexual purity (that is in her childhood). In the analysis\r\nof the dream we may clearly distinguish the two trains of thought, of\r\nwhich the comforting one seems to be superficial, the reproachful one\r\nmore profound. The two are diametrically opposed to each other, and\r\ntheir like but contrasting elements have been represented by the\r\nidentical dream elements.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of dream formation is favourable in the highest degree to\r\nonly one of the logical relations. This relation is that of similarity,\r\ncorrespondence, contiguity, \xe2\x80\x9cas though,\xe2\x80\x9d which is capable of being\r\nrepresented in the dream as no other can be, by the most varied\r\nexpedients. The correspondences occurring in the dream, or cases of \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nthough,\xe2\x80\x9d are the chief points of support for the formation of dreams,\r\nand no inconsiderable part of the dream activity consists in creating\r\nnew correspondences of this sort in cases where those which are already\r\nat hand are prevented by the censor of resistance from getting into the\r\ndream. The effort towards condensation shown by the dream activity\r\nassists in the representation of the relation of similarity.\r\n\r\n_Similarity_, _agreement_, _community_, are quite generally expressed in\r\nthe dream by concentration into a _unity_, which is either already found\r\nin the dream material or is newly created. The first case may be\r\nreferred to as _identification_, the second as _composition_.\r\nIdentification is used where the dream is concerned with persons,\r\ncomposition where things are the objects of unification; but\r\ncompositions are also made from persons. Localities are often treated as\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nIdentification consists in giving representation in the dream content to\r\nonly one of a number of persons who are connected by some common\r\nfeature, while the second or the other persons seem to be suppressed as\r\nfar as the dream is concerned. This one representative person in the\r\ndream enters into all the relations and situations which belong to\r\nitself or to the persons who are covered by it. In cases of composition,\r\nhowever, when this has to do with persons, there are already present in\r\nthe dream image features which are characteristic of, but not common to,\r\nthe persons in question, so that a new unity, a composite person,\r\nappears as the result of the union of these features. The composition\r\nitself may be brought about in various ways. Either the dream person\r\nbears the name of one of the persons to whom it refers\xe2\x80\x94and then we know,\r\nin a manner which is quite analogous to knowledge in waking life, that\r\nthis or that person is the one who is meant\xe2\x80\x94while the visual features\r\nbelong to another person; or the dream image itself is composed of\r\nvisual features which in reality are shared by both. Instead of visual\r\nfeatures, also, the part played by the second person may be represented\r\nby the mannerisms which are usually ascribed to him, the words which he\r\nusually speaks, or the situations in which he is usually imagined. In\r\nthe latter method of characterisation the sharp distinction between\r\nidentification and composition of persons begins to disappear. But it\r\nmay also happen that the formation of such a mixed personality is\r\nunsuccessful. The situation of the dream is then attributed to one\r\nperson, and the other\xe2\x80\x94as a rule the more important one\xe2\x80\x94is introduced as\r\nan inactive and unconcerned spectator. The dreamer relates something\r\nlike \xe2\x80\x9cMy mother was also there\xe2\x80\x9d (Stekel).\r\n\r\nThe common feature which justifies the union of the two persons\xe2\x80\x94that is\r\nto say, which is the occasion for it\xe2\x80\x94may either be represented in the\r\ndream or be absent. As a rule, identification or composition of persons\r\nsimply serves the purpose of dispensing with the representation of this\r\ncommon feature. Instead of repeating: \xe2\x80\x9cA is ill disposed towards me, and\r\nB is also,\xe2\x80\x9d I make a composite person of A and B in the dream, or I\r\nconceive A as doing an unaccustomed action which usually characterises\r\nB. The dream person obtained in this way appears in the dream in some\r\nnew connection, and the fact that it signifies both A and B justifies me\r\nin inserting that which is common to both\xe2\x80\x94their hostility towards me\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nthe proper place in the interpretation of the dream. In this manner I\r\noften achieve a very extraordinary degree of condensation of the dream\r\ncontent; I can save myself the direct representation of very complicated\r\nrelations belonging to a person, if I can find a second person who has\r\nan equal claim to a part of these relations. It is also obvious to what\r\nextent this representation by means of identification can circumvent the\r\nresisting censor, which makes the dream activity conform to such harsh\r\nconditions. That which offends the censor may lie in those very ideas\r\nwhich are connected in the dream material with the one person; I now\r\nfind a second person, who likewise has relation to the objectionable\r\nmaterial, but only to a part of it. The contact in that one point which\r\noffends the censor now justified me in forming a composite person, which\r\nis characterised on either hand by indifferent features. This person\r\nresulting from composition or identification, who is unobjectionable to\r\nthe censor, is now suited for incorporation in the dream content, and by\r\nthe application of dream condensation I have satisfied the demands of\r\nthe dream censor.\r\n\r\nIn dreams where a common feature of two persons is represented, this is\r\nusually a hint to look for another concealed common feature, the\r\nrepresentation of which is made impossible by the censor. A displacement\r\nof the common feature has here taken place partly in order to facilitate\r\nrepresentation. From the circumstance that the composite person appears\r\nto me with an indifferent common feature, I must infer that another\r\ncommon feature which is by no means indifferent exists in the dream\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nAccording to what has been said, identification or composition of\r\npersons serves various purposes in the dream; in the first place, to\r\nrepresent a feature common to the two persons; secondly, to represent a\r\ndisplaced common feature; and thirdly, even to give expression to a\r\ncommunity of features that is merely _wished for_. As the wish for a\r\ncommunity between two persons frequently coincides with the exchanging\r\nof these persons, this relation in the dream is also expressed through\r\nidentification. In the dream of Irma\xe2\x80\x99s injection I wish to exchange this\r\npatient for another\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, I wish the latter to be my patient\r\nas the former has been; the dream takes account of this wish by showing\r\nme a person who is called Irma, but who is examined in a position such\r\nas I have had the opportunity of seeing only when occupied with the\r\nother person in question. In the dream about my uncle this substitution\r\nis made the centre of the dream; I identify myself with the minister by\r\njudging and treating my colleague as shabbily as he does.\r\n\r\nIt has been my experience\xe2\x80\x94and to this I have found no exception\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nevery dream treats of one\xe2\x80\x99s own person. Dreams are absolutely egotistic.\r\nIn cases where not my ego, but only a strange person occurs in the dream\r\ncontent, I may safely assume that my ego is concealed behind that person\r\nby means of identification. I am permitted to supplement my ego. On\r\nother occasions when my ego appears in the dream, I am given to\r\nunderstand by the situation in which it is placed that another person is\r\nconcealing himself behind the ego. In this case the dream is intended to\r\ngive me notice that in the interpretation I must transfer something\r\nwhich is connected with this person\xe2\x80\x94the hidden common feature\xe2\x80\x94to myself.\r\nThere are also dreams in which my ego occurs along with other persons\r\nwhich the resolution of the identification again shows to be my ego. By\r\nmeans of this identification I am instructed to unite in my ego certain\r\nideas to whose acceptance the censor has objected. I may also give my\r\nego manifold representation in the dream, now directly, now by means of\r\nidentification with strangers. An extraordinary amount of thought\r\nmaterial may be condensed by means of a few such identifications.[DV]\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the identification of localities designated under\r\ntheir own names is even less difficult than that of persons, because\r\nhere the disturbing influence of the ego, which is all-powerful in the\r\ndream, is lacking. In one of my dreams about Rome (p. 164) the name of\r\nthe place in which I find myself is Rome; I am surprised, however, at\r\nthe great number of German placards at a street corner. The latter is a\r\nwish-fulfilment, which immediately suggests Prague; the wish itself\r\nprobably originated at a period in my youth when I was imbued with a\r\nGerman nationalistic spirit which is suppressed to-day. At the time of\r\nmy dream I was looking forward to meeting a friend in Prague; the\r\nidentification of Rome and Prague is thus to be explained by means of a\r\ndesired common feature; I would rather meet my friend in Rome than in\r\nPrague, I should like to exchange Prague for Rome for the purpose of\r\nthis meeting.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of creating compositions is one of the chief causes of\r\nthe phantastic character so common in dreams, in that it introduces into\r\nthe dream elements which could never have been the objects of\r\nperception. The psychic process which occurs in the formation of\r\ncompositions is obviously the same which we employ in conceiving or\r\nfashioning a centaur or a dragon in waking life. The only difference is\r\nthat in the phantastic creations occurring in waking life the intended\r\nimpression to be made by the new creation is itself the deciding factor,\r\nwhile the composition of the dream is determined by an influence\xe2\x80\x94the\r\ncommon feature in the dream thoughts\xe2\x80\x94which is independent of the form of\r\nthe image. The composition of the dream may be accomplished in a great\r\nmany different ways. In the most artless method of execution the\r\nproperties of the one thing are represented, and this representation is\r\naccompanied by the knowledge that they also belong to another object. A\r\nmore careful technique unites the features of one object with those of\r\nthe other in a new image, while it makes skilful use of resemblance\r\nbetween the two objects which exist in reality. The new creation may\r\nturn out altogether absurd or only phantastically ingenious, according\r\nto the subject-matter and the wit operative in the work of composition.\r\nIf the objects to be condensed into a unity are too incongruous, the\r\ndream activity is content with creating a composition with a\r\ncomparatively distinct nucleus, to which are attached less distinct\r\nmodifications. The unification into one image has here been\r\nunsuccessful, as it were; the two representations overlap and give rise\r\nto something like a contest between visual images. If attempt were made\r\nto construct an idea out of individual images of perception, similar\r\nrepresentations might be obtained in a drawing.\r\n\r\nDreams naturally abound in such compositions; several examples of these\r\nI have given in the dreams already analysed; I shall add more. In the\r\ndream on p. 296, which describes the career of my patient \xe2\x80\x9cin flowery\r\nlanguage,\xe2\x80\x9d the dream ego carries a blossoming twig in her hand, which,\r\nas we have seen, signifies at once innocence and sexual transgression.\r\nMoreover, the twig recalls cherry-blossoms on account of the manner in\r\nwhich the blossoms are clustered; the blossoms themselves, separately\r\nconsidered, are camelias, and finally the whole thing also gives the\r\nimpression of an _exotic_ plant. The common feature in the elements of\r\nthis composition is shown by the dream thoughts. The blossoming twig is\r\nmade up of allusions to presents by which she was induced or should have\r\nbeen induced to show herself agreeable. So it was with the cherries in\r\nher childhood and with the stem of camelias in her later years; the\r\nexotic feature is an illusion to a much-travelled naturalist, who sought\r\nto win her favour by means of a drawing of a flower. Another female\r\npatient creates a middle element out of bath-houses at a bathing resort,\r\nrural outside water-closets, and the garrets of our city dwellings. The\r\nreference to human nakedness and exposure is common to the two first\r\nelements; and we may infer from their connection with the third element\r\nthat (in her childhood) the garret was likewise the scene of exposure. A\r\ndreamer of the male sex makes a composite locality out of two places in\r\nwhich \xe2\x80\x9ctreatment\xe2\x80\x9d is given\xe2\x80\x94my office and the public hall in which he\r\nfirst became acquainted with his wife. Another female patient, after her\r\nelder brother has promised to regale her with caviare, dreams that his\r\nlegs are covered thick with black caviare pearls. The two elements,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccontagion\xe2\x80\x9d in a moral sense and the recollection of a cutaneous\r\neruption in childhood which made her legs look as though studded over\r\nwith red dots instead of black ones, have here been united with the\r\ncaviare pearls to form a new idea\xe2\x80\x94the idea of \xe2\x80\x9cwhat she has inherited\r\nfrom her brother.\xe2\x80\x9d In this dream parts of the human body are treated as\r\nobjects, as is usually the case in dreams. In one of the dreams reported\r\nby Ferenczi[87] there occurred a composition made up of the person of a\r\nphysician and a horse, over which was spread a night-shirt. The common\r\nfeature in these three components was shown in the analysis after the\r\nnight-shirt had been recognised as an allusion to the father of the\r\ndreamer in an infantile scene. In each of the three cases there was some\r\nobject of her sexual inquisitiveness. As a child she had often been\r\ntaken by her nurse to the military breeding station, where she had the\r\namplest opportunity to satisfy her curiosity, which was at that time\r\nuninhibited.\r\n\r\nI have already asserted that the dream has no means for expressing the\r\nrelation of contradiction, of contrast, of negation. I am about to\r\ncontradict this assertion for the first time. A part of the cases, which\r\nmay be summed up under the word \xe2\x80\x9ccontrast,\xe2\x80\x9d finds representation, as we\r\nhave seen, simply by means of identification\xe2\x80\x94that is, when an\r\ninterchange or replacement can be connected with the contrast. We have\r\ngiven repeated examples of this. Another part of the contrasts in the\r\ndream thoughts, which perhaps falls into the category \xe2\x80\x9cturned into the\r\nopposite,\xe2\x80\x9d is represented in the dream in the following remarkable\r\nmanner, which may almost be designated as witty. The \xe2\x80\x9c_inversion_\xe2\x80\x9d does\r\nnot itself get into the dream content, but manifests its presence there\r\nby means of the fact that a part of the already formed dream\r\ncontent which lies at hand for other reasons, is\xe2\x80\x94as it were\r\nsubsequently\xe2\x80\x94inverted. It is easier to illustrate this process than to\r\ndescribe it. In the beautiful \xe2\x80\x9cUp and Down\xe2\x80\x9d dream (p. 267) the\r\nrepresentation of ascending is an inversion of a prototype in the dream\r\nthoughts, that is to say, of the introductory scene of Daudet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_Sappho_; in the dream climbing is difficult at first, and easy later\r\non, while in the actual scene it is easy at first, and later becomes\r\nmore and more difficult. Likewise \xe2\x80\x9cabove\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbelow\xe2\x80\x9d in relation to the\r\ndreamer\xe2\x80\x99s brother are inverted in the dream. This points to a relation\r\nof contraries or contrasts as obtaining between two parts of the\r\nsubject-matter of the dream thoughts and the relation we have found in\r\nthe fact that in the childish fancy of the dreamer he is carried by his\r\nnurse, while in the novel, on the contrary, the hero carries his\r\nbeloved. My dream about Goethe\xe2\x80\x99s attack upon Mr. M. (p. 345) also\r\ncontains an \xe2\x80\x9cinversion\xe2\x80\x9d of this sort, which must first be set right\r\nbefore the interpretation of the dream can be accomplished. In the dream\r\nGoethe attacks a young man, Mr. M.; in reality, according to the dream\r\nthoughts, an eminent man, my friend, has been attacked by an unknown\r\nyoung author. In the dream I reckon time from the date of Goethe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath; in reality the reckoning was made from the year in which the\r\nparalytic was born. The thought determining the dream material is shown\r\nto be an objection to the treatment of Goethe as a lunatic. \xe2\x80\x9cThe other\r\nway around,\xe2\x80\x9d says the dream; \xe2\x80\x9cif you cannot understand the book, it is\r\nyou who are dull-witted, not the author.\xe2\x80\x9d Furthermore, all these dreams\r\nof inversion seem to contain a reference to the contemptuous phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nturn one\xe2\x80\x99s back upon a person\xe2\x80\x9d (German: \xe2\x80\x9ceinen die Kehrseite zeigen\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\n_cf._ the inversion in respect to the dreamer\xe2\x80\x99s brother in the _Sappho_\r\ndream). It is also remarkable how frequently inversion becomes necessary\r\nin dreams which are inspired by repressed homosexual feelings.\r\n\r\nMoreover, inversion or transformation into an opposite is one of the\r\nfavourite methods of representation, and one of the methods most capable\r\nof varied application which the dream activity possesses. Its first\r\nfunction is to create the fulfilment of a wish with reference to a\r\ndefinite element of the dream-thoughts. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it were only just the other\r\nway!\xe2\x80\x9d is often the best expression of the relation of the ego to a\r\ndisagreeable recollection. But inversion becomes extraordinarily useful\r\nfor the purposes of the censor, for it brings about in the material\r\nrepresented a degree of disfiguration which all but paralyses our\r\nunderstanding of the dream. For this reason it is always permissible, in\r\ncases where the dream stubbornly refuses to yield its meaning, to try\r\nthe inversion of definite portions of its manifest content, whereupon\r\nnot infrequently everything becomes clear.\r\n\r\nBesides this inversion, the subject-matter inversion in temporal\r\nrelation is not to be overlooked. A frequent device of dream\r\ndisfigurement consists in presenting the final issue of an occurrence or\r\nthe conclusion of an argument at the beginning of the dream, or in\r\nsupplying the premises of a conclusion or the causes of an effect at the\r\nend of it. Any one who has not considered this technical method of dream\r\ndisfigurement stands helpless before the problem of dream\r\ninterpretation.[DW]\r\n\r\nIndeed in some cases we can obtain the sense of the dream only by\r\nsubjecting the dream content to manifold inversion in different\r\ndirections. For example, in the dream of a young patient suffering from\r\na compulsion neurosis, the memory of an infantile death-wish against a\r\ndreaded father was hidden behind the following words: _His father\r\nupbraids him because he arrives so late._ But the context in the\r\npsychoanalytic treatment and the thoughts of the dreamer alike go to\r\nshow that the sentence must read as follows: _He is angry at his\r\nfather_, and, further, that his father is always coming home _too early_\r\n(_i.e._ too soon). He would have preferred that his father should not\r\ncome home at all, which is identical with the wish (see page 219) that\r\nhis father should die. As a little boy the dreamer was guilty of sexual\r\naggression against another person while his father was away, and he was\r\nthreatened with punishment in the words: \xe2\x80\x9cJust wait until father comes\r\nhome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we attempt to trace the relations between dream content and dream\r\nthoughts further, we shall do this best by making the dream itself our\r\nstarting-point and by asking ourselves the question: What do certain\r\nformal characteristics of dream representation signify with reference to\r\nthe dream thoughts? The formal characteristics which must attract our\r\nattention in the dream primarily include variations in the distinctness\r\nof individual parts of the dream or of whole dreams in relation to one\r\nanother. The variations in the intensity of individual dream images\r\ninclude a whole scale of degrees ranging from a distinctness of\r\ndepiction which one is inclined to rate as higher\xe2\x80\x94without warrant, to be\r\nsure\xe2\x80\x94than that of reality, to a provoking indistinctness which is\r\ndeclared to be characteristic of the dream, because it cannot altogether\r\nbe compared to any degree of indistinctness which we ever see in real\r\nobjects. Moreover, we usually designate the impression which we get from\r\nan indistinct object in the dream as \xe2\x80\x9cfleeting,\xe2\x80\x9d while we think of the\r\nmore distinct dream images as remaining intact for a longer period of\r\nperception. We must now ask ourselves by what conditions in the dream\r\nmaterial these differences in the vividness of the different parts of\r\nthe dream content are brought about.\r\n\r\nThere are certain expectations which will inevitably arise at this point\r\nand which must be met. Owing to the fact that real sensations during\r\nsleep may form part of the material of the dream, it will probably be\r\nassumed that these sensations or the dream elements resulting from them\r\nare emphasized by peculiar intensity, or conversely, that what turns out\r\nto be particularly vivid in the dream is probably traceable to such real\r\nsensations during sleep. My experience has never confirmed this. It is\r\nincorrect to say that those elements of the dream which are the\r\nderivatives of impressions occurring in sleep (nervous excitements) are\r\ndistinguished by their vividness from others which are based on\r\nrecollections. The factor of reality is of no account in determining the\r\nintensity of dream images.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the expectation will be cherished that the sensory\r\nintensity (vividness) of individual dream images has a relation to the\r\npsychic intensity of the elements corresponding to them in the\r\ndream-thoughts. In the latter intensity is identical with psychic value;\r\nthe most intense elements are in fact the most significant, and these\r\nare the central point of the dream. We know, however, that it is just\r\nthese elements which are usually not accepted in the dream content owing\r\nto the censor. But still it might be possible that the elements\r\nimmediately following these and representing them might show a higher\r\ndegree of intensity, without, however, for that reason constituting the\r\ncentre of the dream representation. This expectation is also destroyed\r\nby a comparison of the dream and the dream material. The intensity of\r\nthe elements in the one has nothing to do with the intensity of the\r\nelements in the other; a complete \xe2\x80\x9ctransvaluation of all psychic values\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ntakes place between the dream-material and the dream. The very element\r\nwhich is transient and hazy and which is pushed into the background by\r\nmore vigorous images is often the single and only element in which may\r\nbe traced any direct derivative from the subject which entirely\r\ndominated the dream-thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of the elements of the dream shows itself to be determined\r\nin a different manner\xe2\x80\x94that is, by two factors which are independent of\r\neach other. It is easy to see at the outset that those elements by means\r\nof which the wish-fulfilment is expressed are most distinctly\r\nrepresented. But then analysis also teaches us that from the most vivid\r\nelements of the dream, the greatest number of trains of thought start,\r\nand that the most vivid are at the same time those which are best\r\ndetermined. No change of sense is involved if we express the latter\r\nempirical thesis in the following form: the greatest intensity is shown\r\nby those elements of the dream for which the most abundant condensation\r\nactivity was required. We may therefore expect that this condition and\r\nthe others imposed by the wish-fulfilment can be expressed in a single\r\nformula.\r\n\r\nThe problem which I have just been considering\xe2\x80\x94the causes of greater or\r\nless intensity or distinctness of individual elements of the dream\xe2\x80\x94is\r\none which I should like to guard against being confused with another\r\nproblem, which has to do with the varying distinctness of whole dreams\r\nor sections of dreams. In the first case, the opposite of distinctness\r\nis blurredness; in the second, confusion. It is of course unmistakable\r\nthat the intensities rise and fall in the two scales in unison. A\r\nportion of the dream which seems clear to us usually contains vivid\r\nelements; an obscure dream is composed of less intense elements. But the\r\nproblem with which we are confronted by the scale, ranging from the\r\napparently clear to the indistinct or confused, is far more complicated\r\nthan that formed by variations in the vividness of the dream elements;\r\nindeed the former will be dropped from the discussion for reasons which\r\nwill be given later. In isolated cases we are astonished to find that\r\nthe impression of clearness or indistinctness produced by the dream is\r\naltogether without significance for its structure, and that it\r\noriginates in the dream material as one of its constituents. Thus I\r\nremember a dream which seemed particularly well constructed, flawless,\r\nand clear, so that I made up my mind, while I was still in the somnolent\r\nstate, to recognise a new class of dreams\xe2\x80\x94those which had not been\r\nsubject to the mechanism of condensation and displacement, and which\r\nmight thus be designated \xe2\x80\x9cFancies while asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d A closer examination\r\nproved that this rare dream had the same breaches and flaws in its\r\nconstruction as every other; for this reason I abandoned the category of\r\ndream fancies. The content of the dream, reduced to its lowest terms,\r\nwas that I was reciting to a friend a difficult and long-sought theory\r\nof bisexuality, and the wish-fulfilling power of the dream was\r\nresponsible for the fact that this theory (which, by the way, was not\r\nstated in the dream) appeared so clear and flawless. What I considered a\r\njudgment upon the finished dream was thus a part of the dream content,\r\nand the essential one at that. The dream activity had extended its\r\noperations, as it were, into waking thought, and had presented to me in\r\nthe form of a judgment that part of the dream material which it had not\r\nsucceeded in reproducing with exactness. The exact opposite of this once\r\ncame to my attention in the case of a female patient who was at first\r\naltogether unwilling to tell a dream which was necessary for the\r\nanalysis, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it was so obscure and confused,\xe2\x80\x9d and who declared,\r\nafter repeatedly denying the accuracy of her description, that several\r\npersons, herself, her husband, and her father, had occurred in the\r\ndream, and that it seemed as though she did not know whether her husband\r\nwas her father, or who her father was anyway, or something of that sort.\r\nUpon considering this dream in connection with the ideas that occurred\r\nto the dreamer in the course of the sitting, it was found unquestionably\r\nto be concerned with the story of a servant girl who had to confess that\r\nshe was expecting a child, and who was now confronted with doubts as to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwho was really the father.\xe2\x80\x9d[DX] The obscurity manifested by the dream,\r\ntherefore, is again in this case a portion of the material which excited\r\nit. A part of this material was represented in the form of the dream.\r\nThe form of the dream or of dreaming is used with astonishing frequency\r\nto represent the concealed content.\r\n\r\nComments on the dream and seemingly harmless observations about it often\r\nserve in the most subtle manner to conceal\xe2\x80\x94although they usually\r\nbetray\xe2\x80\x94a part of what is dreamed. Thus, for example, when the dreamer\r\nsays: _Here the dream is vague_, and the analysis gives an infantile\r\nreminiscence of listening to a person cleaning himself after defecation.\r\nAnother example deserves to be recorded in detail. A young man has a\r\nvery distinct dream which recalls to him phantasies from his infancy\r\nwhich have remained conscious to him: he was in a summer hotel one\r\nevening, he mistook the number of his room, and entered a room in which\r\nan elderly lady and her two daughters were undressing to go to bed. He\r\ncontinues: \xe2\x80\x9c_Then there are some gaps in the dream; then something is\r\nmissing_; and at the end there was a man in the room who wished to throw\r\nme out with whom I had to wrestle.\xe2\x80\x9d He endeavoured in vain to recall the\r\ncontent and purpose of the boyish fancy to which the dream apparently\r\nalludes. But we finally become aware that the required content had\r\nalready been given in his utterances concerning the indistinct part of\r\nthe dream. The \xe2\x80\x9cgaps\xe2\x80\x9d were the openings in the genitals of the women who\r\nwere retiring: \xe2\x80\x9cHere something is missing\xe2\x80\x9d described the chief character\r\nof the female genitals. In those early years he burned with curiosity to\r\nsee a female genital, and was still inclined to adhere to the infantile\r\nsexual theory which attributes a male genital to the woman.\r\n\r\nAll the dreams which have been dreamed in the same night belong to the\r\nsame whole when considered with respect to their content; their\r\nseparation into several portions, their grouping and number, all these\r\ndetails are full of meaning, and may be considered as information coming\r\nfrom the latent dream content. In the interpretation of dreams\r\nconsisting of many principal sections, or of dreams belonging to the\r\nsame night, one must not fail to think of the possibility that these\r\ndifferent and succeeding dreams bring to expression the same feelings in\r\ndifferent material. The one that comes first in time of these homologous\r\ndreams is usually the most disfigured and most bashful, while the\r\nsucceeding is bolder and more distinct.\r\n\r\nEven Pharaoh\xe2\x80\x99s dream in the Bible of the ears and the kine, which Joseph\r\ninterpreted, was of this kind. It is reported by Josephus (_Antiquities\r\nof the Jews_, bk. ii. chap, iii.) in greater detail than in the Bible.\r\nAfter relating the first dream, the King said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I had seen this\r\nvision I awaked out of my sleep, and being in disorder, and considering\r\nwith myself what this appearance should be, I fell asleep again, and saw\r\nanother dream much more wonderful than the first, which did still more\r\naffright and disturb me.\xe2\x80\x9d After listening to the report of the dream,\r\nJoseph said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis dream, O King, although seen under two forms,\r\nsignifies one and the same issue of things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJung,[99] who, in his _Beitrag zur Psychologie des Ger\xc3\xbcchtes_ relates\r\nhow the veiled erotic dream of a school-girl was understood by her\r\nfriends without interpretation and continued by them with variations,\r\nremarks in connection with reports of this dream, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the last of a\r\nlong series of dream pictures contained precisely the same thought whose\r\nrepresentation had been attempted in the first picture of the series.\r\nThe censor pushed the complex out of the way as long as possible,\r\nthrough constantly renewed symbolic concealments, displacements,\r\ndeviations into the harmless, &c.\xe2\x80\x9d (_l.c._ p. 87). Scherner[58] was well\r\nacquainted with the peculiarities of dream disfigurement and describes\r\nthem at the end of his theory of organic stimulation as a special law,\r\np. 166: \xe2\x80\x9cBut, finally, the phantasy observes the general law in all\r\nnerve stimuli emanating from symbolic dream formations, by representing\r\nat the beginning of the dream only the remotest and freest allusions to\r\nthe stimulating object; but towards the end, when the power of\r\nrepresentation becomes exhausted, it presents the stimulus or its\r\nconcerned organ or its function in unconcealed form, and in the way this\r\ndream designates its organic motive and reaches its end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA new confirmation of Scherner\xe2\x80\x99s law has been furnished by Otto\r\nRank[106] in his work, _A Self Interpretation Dream_. This dream of a\r\ngirl reported by him consisted of two dreams, separated in time of the\r\nsame night, the second of which ended with pollution. This pollution\r\ndream could be interpreted in all its details by disregarding a great\r\nmany of the ideas contributed by the dreamer, and the profuse relations\r\nbetween the two dream contents indicated that the first dream expressed\r\nin bashful language the same thing as the second, so that the latter\xe2\x80\x94the\r\npollution dream\xe2\x80\x94helped to a full explanation of the former. From this\r\nexample, Rank, with perfect justice, draws conclusions concerning the\r\nsignificance of pollution dreams in general.\r\n\r\nBut in my experience it is only in rare cases that one is in a position\r\nto interpret clearness or confusion in the dream as certainty or doubt\r\nin the dream material. Later I shall try to discover the factor in the\r\nformation of dreams upon whose influence this scale of qualities\r\nessentially depends.\r\n\r\nIn some dreams, which adhere for a time to a certain situation and\r\nscenery, there occur interruptions described in the following words:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then it seemed as though it were at the same time another place,\r\nand there such and such a thing happened.\xe2\x80\x9d What thus interrupts the main\r\ntrend of the dream, which after a while may be continued again, turns\r\nout to be a subordinate idea, an interpolated thought in the dream\r\nmaterial. A conditional relation in the dream-thoughts is represented by\r\nsimultaneousness in the dream (wenn\xe2\x80\x94wann; if\xe2\x80\x94when).\r\n\r\nWhat is signified by the sensation of impeded movement, which so often\r\noccurs in the dream, and which is so closely allied to anxiety? One\r\nwants to move, and is unable to stir from the spot; or one wants to\r\naccomplish something, and meets one obstacle after another. The train is\r\nabout to start, and one cannot reach it; one\xe2\x80\x99s hand is raised to avenge\r\nan insult, and its strength fails, &c. We have already encountered this\r\nsensation in exhibition dreams, but have as yet made no serious attempt\r\nto interpret it. It is convenient, but inadequate, to answer that there\r\nis motor paralysis in sleep, which manifests itself by means of the\r\nsensation alluded to. We may ask: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it, then, that we do not dream\r\ncontinually of these impeded motions?\xe2\x80\x9d And we are justified in supposing\r\nthat this sensation, constantly appearing in sleep, serves some purpose\r\nor other in representation, and is brought about by a need occurring in\r\nthe dream material for this sort of representation.\r\n\r\nFailure to accomplish does not always appear in the dream as a\r\nsensation, but also simply as a part of the dream content. I believe\r\nthat a case of this sort is particularly well suited to enlighten us\r\nabout the significance of this characteristic of the dream. I shall give\r\nan abridged report of a dream in which I seem to be accused of\r\ndishonesty. _The scene is a mixture, consisting of a private sanatorium\r\nand several other buildings. A lackey appears to call me to an\r\nexamination. I know in the dream that something has been missed, and\r\nthat the examination is taking place because I am suspected of having\r\nappropriated the lost article. Analysis shows that examination is to be\r\ntaken in two senses, and also means medical examination. Being conscious\r\nof my innocence, and of the fact that I have been called in for\r\nconsultation, I calmly follow the lackey. We are received at the door by\r\nanother lackey, who says, pointing to me, \xe2\x80\x9cIs that the person whom you\r\nhave brought? Why, he is a respectable man.\xe2\x80\x9d Thereupon, without any\r\nlackey, I enter a great hall in which machines are standing, and which\r\nreminds me of an Inferno with its hellish modes of punishment. I see a\r\ncolleague strapped on to one apparatus who has every reason to be\r\nconcerned about me; but he takes no notice of me. Then I am given to\r\nunderstand that I may now go. Then I cannot find my hat, and cannot go\r\nafter all._\r\n\r\nThe wish which the dream fulfils is obviously that I may be acknowledged\r\nto be an honest man, and may go; all kinds of subject-matter containing\r\na contradiction of this idea must therefore be present in the\r\ndream-thoughts. The fact that I may go is the sign of my absolution; if,\r\nthen, the dream furnishes at its close an event which prevents me from\r\ngoing, we may readily conclude that the suppressed subject-matter of the\r\ncontradiction asserts itself in this feature. The circumstance that I\r\ncannot find my hat therefore means: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not an honest man after\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d Failure to accomplish in the dream is the expression of a\r\ncontradiction, a \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d; and therefore the earlier assertion, to the\r\neffect that the dream is not capable of expressing a negation, must be\r\nrevised accordingly.[DY]\r\n\r\nIn other dreams which involve failure to accomplish a thing not only as\r\na situation but also as a sensation, the same contradiction is more\r\nemphatically expressed in the form of a volition, to which a counter\r\nvolition opposes itself. Thus the sensation of impeded motion represents\r\na _conflict of will_. We shall hear later that this very motor paralysis\r\nbelongs to the fundamental conditions of the psychic process in\r\ndreaming. Now the impulse which is transferred to motor channels is\r\nnothing else than the will, and the fact that we are sure to find this\r\nimpulse impeded in the dream makes the whole process extraordinarily\r\nwell suited to represent volition and the \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d which opposes itself\r\nthereto. From my explanation of anxiety, it is easy to understand why\r\nthe sensation of thwarted will is so closely allied to anxiety, and why\r\nit is so often connected with it in the dream. Anxiety is a libidinous\r\nimpulse which emanates from the unconscious, and is inhibited by the\r\nforeconscious. Therefore, when a sensation of inhibition in the dream is\r\naccompanied by anxiety, there must also be present a volition which has\r\nat one time been capable of arousing a _libido_; there must be a sexual\r\nimpulse.\r\n\r\nWhat significance and what psychic force is to be ascribed to such\r\nmanifestations of judgment as \xe2\x80\x9cFor that is only a dream,\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\nfrequently comes to the surface in dreams, I shall discuss in another\r\nplace (_vide infra_, p. 390). For the present I shall merely say that\r\nthey serve to depreciate the value of the thing dreamed. An interesting\r\nproblem allied to this, namely, the meaning of the fact that sometimes a\r\ncertain content is designated in the dream itself as \xe2\x80\x9cdreamed\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nriddle of the \xe2\x80\x9cdream within the dream\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94has been solved in a similar\r\nsense by W. Stekel[114] through the analysis of some convincing\r\nexamples. The part of the dream \xe2\x80\x9cdreamed\xe2\x80\x9d is again to be depreciated in\r\nvalue and robbed of its reality; that which the dreamer continues to\r\ndream after awakening from the dream within the dream, is what the\r\ndream-wish desires to put in place of the extinguished reality. It may\r\ntherefore be assumed that the part \xe2\x80\x9cdreamed\xe2\x80\x9d contains the representation\r\nof the reality and the real reminiscence, while, on the other hand, the\r\ncontinued dream contains the representation of what the dreamer wished.\r\nThe inclusion of a certain content in a \xe2\x80\x9cdream within the dream\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\ntherefore equivalent to the wish that what has just been designated as a\r\ndream should not have occurred. The dream-work utilises the dream itself\r\nas a form of deflection.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   (_d_) _Regard for Presentability_\r\n\r\nSo far we have been attempting to ascertain how the dream represents the\r\nrelations among the dream-thoughts, but we have several times extended\r\nour consideration to the further question of what alterations the dream\r\nmaterial undergoes for the purposes of dream formation. We now know that\r\nthe dream material, after being stripped of the greater parts of its\r\nrelations, is subjected to compression, while at the same time\r\ndisplacements of intensity among its elements force a psychic\r\nrevaluation of this material. The displacements which we have considered\r\nwere shown to be substitutions of one idea for another, the substitute\r\nbeing in some way connected with the original by associations, and the\r\ndisplacements were put to the service of condensation by virtue of the\r\nfact that in this manner a common mean between two elements took the\r\nplace of these two elements in the formation of the dream. We have not\r\nyet mentioned any other kind of displacement. But we learn from the\r\nanalyses that another exists, and that it manifests itself in a change\r\nof the verbal expression employed for the thought in question. In both\r\ncases we have displacement following a chain of associations, but the\r\nsame process takes place in different psychic spheres, and the result of\r\nthis displacement in the one case is that one element is substituted for\r\nanother, while in the other case an element exchanges its verbal\r\nexpression for another.\r\n\r\nThis second kind of displacement occurring in dream formation not only\r\npossesses great theoretical interest, but is also peculiarly well fitted\r\nto explain the semblance of phantastic absurdity in which the dream\r\ndisguises itself. Displacement usually occurs in such a way that a\r\ncolourless and abstract expression in the dream-thought is exchanged for\r\none that is visual and concrete. The advantage, and consequently the\r\npurpose, of this substitution is obvious. Whatever is visual is _capable\r\nof representation_ in the dream, and can be wrought into situations\r\nwhere the abstract expression would confront dream representation with\r\ndifficulties similar to those which would arise if a political editorial\r\nwere to be represented in an illustrated journal. But not only the\r\npossibility of representation, but also the interests of condensation\r\nand of the censor, can be furthered by this change. If the abstractly\r\nexpressed and unwieldy dream-thought is recast into figurative language,\r\nthis new expression and the rest of the dream material are more easily\r\nfurnished with those identities and cross references, which are\r\nessential to the dream activity and which it creates whenever they are\r\nnot at hand, for the reason that in every language concrete terms, owing\r\nto their evolution, are more abundant in associations than conceptual\r\nones. It may be imagined that in dream formation a good part of the\r\nintermediary activity, which tries to reduce the separate dream-thoughts\r\nto the tersest and simplest possible expression in the dream, takes\r\nplace in the manner above described\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, in providing\r\nsuitable paraphrase for the individual thoughts. One thought whose\r\nexpression has already been determined on other grounds will thus exert\r\na separating and selective influence upon the means available for\r\nexpressing the other, and perhaps it will do this constantly throughout,\r\nsomewhat after the manner of the poet. If a poem in rhyme is to be\r\ncomposed, the second rhyming line is bound by two conditions; it must\r\nexpress the proper meaning, and it must express it in such a way as to\r\nsecure the rhyme. The best poems are probably those in which the poet\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neffort to find a rhyme is unconscious, and in which both thoughts have\r\nfrom the beginning exercised a mutual influence in the selection of\r\ntheir verbal expressions, which can then be made to rhyme by a means of\r\nslight remodification.\r\n\r\nIn some cases change of expression serves the purposes of dream\r\ncondensation more directly, in making possible the invention of a verbal\r\nconstruction which is ambiguous and therefore suited to the expression\r\nof more than one dream-thought. The whole range of word-play is thus put\r\nat the service of the dream activity. The part played by words in the\r\nformation of dreams ought not to surprise us. A word being a point of\r\njunction for a number of conceptions, it possesses, so to speak, a\r\npredestined ambiguity, and neuroses (obsessions, phobias) take advantage\r\nof the conveniences which words offer for the purposes of condensation\r\nand disguise quite as readily as the dream.[DZ] That dream conception\r\nalso profits by this displacement of expression is easily demonstrated.\r\nIt is naturally confusing if an ambiguous word is put in the place of\r\ntwo ambiguous ones; and the employment of a figurative expression\r\ninstead of the sober everyday one thwarts our understanding, especially\r\nsince the dream never tells us whether the elements which it shows are\r\nto be interpreted literally or figuratively, or whether they refer to\r\nthe dream material directly or only through the agency of interpolated\r\nforms of speech.[EA] Several examples of representations in the dream\r\nwhich are held together only by ambiguity have already been cited (\xe2\x80\x9cher\r\nmouth opens without difficulty,\xe2\x80\x9d in the dream of Irma\xe2\x80\x99s injection; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ncannot go yet,\xe2\x80\x9d in the last dream reported, p. 312), &c. I shall now\r\ncite a dream in the analysis of which the figurative expression of\r\nabstract thought plays a greater part. The difference between such dream\r\ninterpretation and interpretation by symbolism may again be sharply\r\ndistinguished; in the symbolic interpretation of dreams the key to the\r\nsymbolism is arbitrarily chosen by the interpreter, while in our own\r\ncases of verbal disguise all these keys are universally known and are\r\ntaken from established customs of speech. If the correct notion occurs\r\nat the right opportunity, it is possible to solve dreams of this sort\r\ncompletely or in part, independently of any statements made by the\r\ndreamer.\r\n\r\nA lady, a friend of mine, dreams: _She is in the opera-house. It is a\r\nWagnerian performance which has lasted till 7.45 in the morning. In the\r\nparquette and parterre there are tables, around which people dine and\r\ndrink. Her cousin and his young wife, who have just returned from their\r\nhoneymoon, sit next to her at one of these tables, and next to them sits\r\none of the aristocracy. Concerning the latter the idea is that the young\r\nwife has brought him back with her from the wedding journey. It is quite\r\nabove board, just as if she were bringing back a hat from her trip. In\r\nthe midst of the parquette there is a high tower, on the top of which is\r\na platform surrounded by an iron grating. There, high up, stands the\r\nconductor with the features of Hans Richter; he is continually running\r\naround behind the grating, perspiring awfully, and from this position\r\nconducting the orchestra, which is arranged around the base of the\r\ntower. She herself sits in a box with a lady friend (known to me). Her\r\nyoungest sister tries to hand her from the parquette a big piece of coal\r\nwith the idea that she did not know that it would last so long and that\r\nshe must by this time be terribly cold. (It was a little as if the boxes\r\nhad to be heated during the long performance.)_\r\n\r\nThe dream is senseless enough, though the situation is well developed\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94the tower in the midst of the parquette from which the conductor\r\nleads the orchestra; but, above all, the coal which her sister hands\r\nher! I purposely asked for no analysis of this dream. With the knowledge\r\nI have of the personal relations of the dreamer, I was able to interpret\r\nparts of it independently. I knew that she had entertained warm feelings\r\nfor a musician whose career had been prematurely blasted by insanity. I\r\ntherefore decided to take the tower in the parquette verbally. It was\r\napparent, then, that the man whom she wished to see in the place of Hans\r\nRichter _towered_ above all the other members of the orchestra. This\r\ntower must, therefore, be designated as a composite picture formed by an\r\napposition; with its pedestal it represents the greatness of the man,\r\nbut with its gratings on top, behind which he runs around like a\r\nprisoner or an animal in a cage (an allusion to the name of the\r\nunfortunate man), it represents his later fate. \xe2\x80\x9cLunatic-tower\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\nperhaps the word in which both thoughts might have met.\r\n\r\nNow that we have discovered the dream\xe2\x80\x99s method of representation, we may\r\ntry with the same key to open the second apparent absurdity,\xe2\x80\x94that of the\r\ncoal which her sister hands her. \xe2\x80\x9cCoal\xe2\x80\x9d must mean \xe2\x80\x9csecret love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cNo _coal_, no _fire_ so hotly glows\r\n               As the _secret love_ which no one knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe and her friend remain seated while her younger sister, who still has\r\nopportunities to marry, hands her up the coal \xe2\x80\x9cbecause she did not know\r\nit would last so long.\xe2\x80\x9d What would last so long is not told in the\r\ndream. In relating it we would supply \xe2\x80\x9cthe performance\xe2\x80\x9d; but in the\r\ndream we must take the sentence as it is, declare it ambiguous, and add\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cuntil she marries.\xe2\x80\x9d The interpretation \xe2\x80\x9csecret love\xe2\x80\x9d is then confirmed\r\nby the mention of the cousin who sits with his wife in the parquette,\r\nand by the open love-affair attributed to the latter. The contrasts\r\nbetween secret and open love, between her fire and the coldness of the\r\nyoung wife, dominate the dream. Moreover, here again there is a person\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cin high position\xe2\x80\x9d as a middle term between the aristocrat and the\r\nmusician entitled to high hopes.\r\n\r\nBy means of the above discussion we have at last brought to light a\r\nthird factor, whose part in the transformation of the dream thoughts\r\ninto the dream content is not to be considered trivial; _it is the\r\nregard for presentability_ (_German: Darstellbarkeit_) _in the peculiar\r\npsychic material which the dream makes use of_,\xe2\x80\x94that is fitness for\r\nrepresentation, for the most part by means of visual images. Among the\r\nvarious subordinate ideas associated with the essential dream thoughts,\r\nthat one will be preferred which permits of a visual representation, and\r\nthe dream-activity does not hesitate promptly to recast the inflexible\r\nthought into another verbal form, even if it is the more unusual one, as\r\nlong as this form makes dramatisation possible, and thus puts an end to\r\nthe psychological distress caused by cramped thinking. This pouring of\r\nthe thought content into another mould may at the same time be put at\r\nthe service of the condensation work, and may establish relations with\r\nanother thought which would otherwise not be present. This other thought\r\nitself may perhaps have previously changed its original expression for\r\nthe purpose of meeting these relations half-way.\r\n\r\nIn view of the part played by puns, quotations, songs, and proverbs in\r\nthe intellectual life of educated persons, it would be entirely in\r\naccordance with our expectation to find disguises of this sort used with\r\nextraordinary frequency. For a few kinds of material a universally\r\napplicable dream symbolism has been established on a basis of generally\r\nknown allusions and equivalents. A good part of this symbolism,\r\nmoreover, is possessed by the dream in common with the psychoneuroses,\r\nand with legends and popular customs.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if we look more closely, we must recognise that in employing\r\nthis method of substitution the dream is generally doing nothing\r\noriginal. For the attainment of its purpose, which in this case is the\r\npossibility of dramatisation without interference from the censor, it\r\nsimply follows the paths which it finds already marked out in\r\nunconscious thought, and gives preference to those transformations of\r\nthe suppressed material which may become conscious also in the form of\r\nwit and allusion, and with which all the fancies of neurotics are\r\nfilled. Here all at once we come to understand Scherner\xe2\x80\x99s method of\r\ndream interpretation, the essential truth of which I have defended\r\nelsewhere. The occupation of one\xe2\x80\x99s fancy with one\xe2\x80\x99s own body is by no\r\nmeans peculiar to, or characteristic of the dream alone. My analyses\r\nhave shown me that this is a regular occurrence in the unconscious\r\nthought of neurotics, and goes back to sexual curiosity, the object of\r\nwhich for the adolescent youth or maiden is found in the genitals of the\r\nopposite sex, or even of the same sex. But, as Scherner and Volkelt very\r\nappropriately declare, the house is not the only group of ideas which is\r\nused for the symbolisation of the body\xe2\x80\x94either in the dream or in the\r\nunconscious fancies of the neurosis. I know some patients, to be sure,\r\nwho have steadily adhered to an architectural symbolism for the body and\r\nthe genitals (sexual interest certainly extends far beyond the region of\r\nthe external genital organs), to whom posts and pillars signify legs (as\r\nin the \xe2\x80\x9cSong of Songs\xe2\x80\x9d), to whom every gate suggests a bodily opening\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9chole\xe2\x80\x9d), and every water-main a urinary apparatus, and the like. But\r\nthe group of associations belonging to plant life and to the kitchen is\r\njust as eagerly chosen to conceal sexual images; in the first case the\r\nusage of speech, the result of phantastic comparisons dating from the\r\nmost ancient times, has made abundant preparation (the \xe2\x80\x9cvineyard\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\nLord, the \xe2\x80\x9cseeds,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cgarden\xe2\x80\x9d of the girl in the \xe2\x80\x9cSong of Songs\xe2\x80\x9d). The\r\nugliest as well as the most intimate details of sexual life may be\r\ndreamed about in apparently harmless allusions to culinary operations,\r\nand the symptoms of hysteria become practically unintelligible if we\r\nforget that sexual symbolism can conceal itself behind the most\r\ncommonplace and most inconspicuous matters, as its best hiding-place.\r\nThe fact that some neurotic children cannot look at blood and raw meat,\r\nthat they vomit at the sight of eggs and noodles, and that the dread of\r\nsnakes, which is natural to mankind, is monstrously exaggerated in\r\nneurotics, all of this has a definite sexual meaning. Wherever the\r\nneurosis employs a disguise of this sort, it treads the paths once\r\ntrodden by the whole of humanity in the early ages of civilisation\xe2\x80\x94paths\r\nof whose existence customs of speech, superstitions, and morals still\r\ngive testimony to this day.\r\n\r\nI here insert the promised flower dream of a lady patient, in which I\r\nhave italicised everything which is to be sexually interpreted. This\r\nbeautiful dream seemed to lose its entire charm for the dreamer after it\r\nhad been interpreted.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Preliminary dream: _She goes to the two maids in the kitchen and\r\nscolds them for taking so long to prepare \xe2\x80\x9ca little bite of food.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nalso sees a great many coarse dishes standing in the kitchen inverted so\r\nthat the water may drip off them, and heaped up in a pile._ Later\r\naddition: _The two maids go to fetch water, and must, as it were, step\r\ninto a river which reaches up into the house or into the yard._[EB]\r\n\r\n(_b_) Main dream[EC]: _She is descending from a high place[ED] over\r\nbalustrades that are curiously fashioned or fences which are united into\r\nbig squares and consist of a conglomeration of little squares.[EE] It is\r\nreally not intended for climbing upon; she is worried about finding a\r\nplace for her foot, and she is glad her dress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get caught\r\nanywhere, and that she remains so respectable while she is going.[EF]\r\nShe is also carrying a large bough in her hand,[EG] really a bough of a\r\ntree, which is thickly studded with red blossoms; it has many branches,\r\nand spreads out.[EH] With this is connected the idea of cherry blossoms,\r\nbut they look like full-bloom camelias, which of course do not grow on\r\ntrees. While she is descending, she first has one, then suddenly two,\r\nand later again only one.[EI] When she arrives at the bottom of the\r\nlower blossoms they have already fallen off to a considerable extent.\r\nNow that she is at the bottom, she sees a porter who is combing\xe2\x80\x94as she\r\nwould like to express it\xe2\x80\x94just such a tree\xe2\x80\x94that is, who is plucking thick\r\nbunches of hair from it, which hang from it like moss. Other workmen\r\nhave chopped off such boughs in a garden, and have thrown them upon the\r\nstreet, where they lie about, so that many people take some of them. But\r\nshe asks whether that is right, whether anybody may take one.[EJ] In the\r\ngarden there stands a young man_ (having a personality with which she is\r\nacquainted, not a member of her family) _up to whom she goes in order to\r\nask him how it is possible to transplant such boughs into her own\r\ngarden.[EK] He embraces her, whereat she resists and asks him what he\r\nmeans, whether it is permissible to embrace her in such a manner. He\r\nsays that there is no wrong in it, that it is permitted.[EL] He then\r\ndeclares himself willing to go with her into the other garden, in order\r\nto show her the transplanting, and he says something to her which she\r\ndoes not correctly understand: \xe2\x80\x9cBesides this three metres_\xe2\x80\x94(later on she\r\nsays: square metres) _or three fathoms of ground are lacking.\xe2\x80\x9d It seems\r\nas though the man were trying to ask her something in return for his\r\naffability, as though he had the intention of indemnifying himself in\r\nher garden, as though he wanted to evade some law or other, to derive\r\nsome advantage from it without causing her an injury. She does not know\r\nwhether or not he really shows her anything._[EM]\r\n\r\nI must mention still another series of associations which often serves\r\nthe purpose of concealing sexual meaning both in dreams and in the\r\nneurosis,\xe2\x80\x94I refer to the change of residence series. To change one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresidence is readily replaced by \xe2\x80\x9cto remove,\xe2\x80\x9d an ambiguous expression\r\nwhich may have reference to clothing. If the dream also contains a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clift\xe2\x80\x9d (elevator), one may think of the verb \xe2\x80\x9cto lift,\xe2\x80\x9d hence of lifting\r\nup the clothing.\r\n\r\nI have naturally an abundance of such material, but a report of it would\r\ncarry us too far into the discussion of neurotic conditions. Everything\r\nleads to the same conclusion, that no special symbolising activity of\r\nthe mind in the formation of dreams need be assumed; that, on the\r\ncontrary, the dream makes use of such symbolisations as are to be found\r\nready-made in unconscious thought, because these better satisfy the\r\nrequirements of dream formation, on account of their dramatic fitness,\r\nand particularly on account of their exemption from the censor.\r\n\r\n\r\n           (_e_) _Examples\xe2\x80\x94Arithmetic Speeches in the Dream_\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed to assign to its proper place the fourth of the factors\r\nwhich control the formation of the dream, I shall cite several examples\r\nfrom my collection of dreams for the purpose partly of illustrating the\r\nco-operation of the three factors with which we are acquainted, and\r\npartly of supplying proof for assertions which have been made without\r\ndemonstration or of drawing irrefutable inferences from them. For it has\r\nbeen very difficult for me in the foregoing account of the dream\r\nactivity to demonstrate my conclusions by means of examples. Examples\r\nfor the individual thesis are convincing only when considered in\r\nconnection with a dream interpretation; when they are torn from their\r\ncontext they lose their significance, and, furthermore, a dream\r\ninterpretation, though not at all profound, soon becomes so extensive\r\nthat it obscures the thread of the discussion which it is intended to\r\nillustrate. This technical motive may excuse me for now mixing together\r\nall sorts of things which have nothing in common but their relation to\r\nthe text of the foregoing chapter.\r\n\r\nWe shall first consider a few examples of very peculiar or unusual\r\nmethods of representation in the dream. The dream of a lady is as\r\nfollows: _A servant girl is standing on a ladder as though to clean the\r\nwindows, and has with her a chimpanzee and a gorilla cat_ (later\r\ncorrected\xe2\x80\x94angora cat). _She throws the animals at the dreamer; the\r\nchimpanzee cuddles up to her, and this is disgusting to her._ This dream\r\nhas accomplished its purpose by the simplest possible means, namely by\r\ntaking a mere mode of speech literally and representing it according to\r\nthe meaning of its words. \xe2\x80\x9cApe,\xe2\x80\x9d like the names of animals in general,\r\nis an epithet of opprobrium, and the situation of the dream means\r\nnothing but \xe2\x80\x9c_to hurl invectives_.\xe2\x80\x9d This same collection will soon\r\nfurnish us with further examples of the use of this simple artifice.\r\n\r\nAnother dream proceeds in a very similar manner: _A woman with a child\r\nthat has a conspicuously deformed cranium; the dreamer has heard that\r\nthe child got into this condition owing to its position in its mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwomb. The doctor says that the cranium might be given a better shape by\r\nmeans of compression, but that would harm the brain. She thinks that\r\nbecause it is a boy it won\xe2\x80\x99t suffer so much from deformity._ This dream\r\ncontains a plastic representation of the concept: \xe2\x80\x9c_Childish\r\nimpressions_,\xe2\x80\x9d which the dreamer has heard of in the course of\r\nexplanations concerning the treatment.\r\n\r\nIn the following example, the dream activity enters upon a different\r\npath. The dream contains a recollection of an excursion to the\r\nHilmteich, near Graz: _There is a terrible storm outside; a miserable\r\nhotel\xe2\x80\x94the water is dripping from the walls, and the beds are damp._ (The\r\nlatter part of the content is less directly expressed than I give it.)\r\nThe dream signifies \xe2\x80\x9c_superfluous_.\xe2\x80\x9d The abstract idea occurring in the\r\ndream thoughts is first made equivocal by a certain straining of\r\nlanguage; it has, perhaps, been replaced by \xe2\x80\x9coverflowing\xe2\x80\x9d or by \xe2\x80\x9cfluid\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9csuper-fluid (-fluous)\xe2\x80\x9d and has then been given representation by an\r\naccumulation of like impressions. Water within, water without, water in\r\nthe beds in the form of dampness\xe2\x80\x94everything fluid and \xe2\x80\x9csuper\xe2\x80\x9d fluid.\r\nThat, for the purposes of the dream representation, the spelling is much\r\nless regarded than the sound of words ought not surprise us when we\r\nremember that rhyme exercises similar privileges.\r\n\r\nThe fact that language has at its disposal a great number of words which\r\nwere originally intended in a picturesque and concrete sense but are at\r\npresent used in a faded abstract sense has in other cases made it very\r\neasy for the dream to represent its thoughts. The dream need only\r\nrestore to these words their full significance, or follow the evolution\r\nof their meaning a little way back. For example, a man dreams that his\r\nfriend, who is struggling to get out of a very tight place, calls upon\r\nhim to help him. The analysis shows that the tight place is a hole, and\r\nthat the dream uses symbolically his very words to his friend, \xe2\x80\x9cBe\r\ncareful, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll get yourself into a hole.\xe2\x80\x9d[EN] Another dreamer climbs\r\nupon a mountain from which he sees a very extraordinary broad view. He\r\nidentifies himself with his brother who is editing a \xe2\x80\x9creview\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\ndeals with relations to the Farthest East.\r\n\r\nIt would be a separate undertaking to collect such methods of\r\nrepresentation and to arrange them according to the principles upon\r\nwhich they are based. Some of the representations are quite witty. They\r\ngive the impression that they would have never been divined if the\r\ndreamer himself had not reported them.\r\n\r\n1. A man dreams that he is asked for a name, which, however, he cannot\r\nrecall. He himself explains that this means: _It does not occur to me in\r\nthe dream._\r\n\r\n2. A female patient relates a dream in which all the persons concerned\r\nwere especially big. \xe2\x80\x9cThat means,\xe2\x80\x9d she adds, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it must deal with an\r\nepisode of my early childhood, for at that time all grown up people\r\nnaturally seemed to me immensely big.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe transference into childhood is also expressed differently in other\r\ndreams by translating time into space. One sees the persons and scenes\r\nin question as if at a great distance, at the end of a long road, or as\r\nif looked at through the wrong end of the opera-glass.\r\n\r\n3. A man, who in waking life shows an inclination to abstract and\r\nindefinite expressions, but who is otherwise endowed with wit enough,\r\ndreams in a certain connection that he is at a railroad station while a\r\ntrain is coming in. But then the station platform approaches the train,\r\nwhich stands still; hence an absurd inversion of the real state of\r\naffairs. This detail is again nothing but an index to remind one that\r\nsomething else in the dream should be turned about. The analysis of the\r\nsame dream brings back the recollection of a picture-book in which men\r\nare represented standing on their heads and walking on their hands.\r\n\r\n4. The same dreamer on another occasion relates a short dream which\r\nalmost recalls the technique of a rebus. His uncle gives him a kiss in\r\nan automobile. He immediately adds the interpretation, which I should\r\nnever have found: it means _Autoerotism_. This might have been made as a\r\njoke in the waking state.\r\n\r\nThe dream work often succeeds in representing very awkward material,\r\nsuch as proper names, by means of the forced utilisation of very\r\nfar-fetched references. In one of my dreams the elder Bruecke _has given\r\nme a task. I compound a preparation, and skim something from it which\r\nlooks like crumpled tinfoil._ (More of this later on.) The notion\r\ncorresponding to this, which was not easy to find, is \xe2\x80\x9cstanniol,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nnow I know that I have in mind the name of the author Stannius, which\r\nwas borne by a treatise on the nervous system of fishes, which I\r\nregarded with awe in my youthful years. The first scientific task which\r\nmy teacher gave me was actually concerned with the nervous system of a\r\nfish\xe2\x80\x94the _Ammoc\xc5\x93tes_. Obviously the latter name could never have been\r\nused in a picture puzzle.\r\n\r\nI shall not omit here to insert a dream having a curious content, which\r\nis also remarkable as a child\xe2\x80\x99s dream, and which is very easily\r\nexplained by the analysis. A lady relates: \xe2\x80\x9cI can remember that when I\r\nwas a child I repeatedly dreamed, that the _dear Lord had a pointed\r\npaper hat on his head_. They used to make me wear such a hat at table\r\nvery often, so that I might not be able to look at the plates of the\r\nother children and see how much they had received of a particular dish.\r\nSince I have learned that God is omniscient, the dream signifies that I\r\nknow everything in spite of the hat which I am made to wear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWherein the dream work consists, and how it manages its material, the\r\ndream thoughts, can be shown in a very instructive manner from the\r\nnumbers and calculations which occur in dreams. Moreover, numbers in\r\ndreams are regarded as of especial significance by superstition. I shall\r\ntherefore give a few more examples of this kind from my own collection.\r\n\r\n1. The following is taken from the dream of a lady shortly before the\r\nclose of her treatment:\r\n\r\nShe wants to pay for something or other; her daughter takes 3 florins\r\nand 65 kreuzer from her pocket-book; but the mother says: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you\r\ndoing? It only costs 21 kreuzer.\xe2\x80\x9d This bit of dream was immediately\r\nintelligible to me without further explanation from my knowledge of the\r\ndreamer\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances. The lady was a foreigner who had provided for\r\nher daughter in an educational institution in Vienna, and who could\r\ncontinue my treatment as long as her daughter stayed in the city. In\r\nthree weeks the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s school year was to end, and with that the\r\ntreatment also stopped. On the day before the dream the principal of the\r\ninstitute had urged her to make up her mind to allow her child to remain\r\nwith her for another year. She had then obviously worked out this\r\nsuggestion to the conclusion that in this case she would be able to\r\ncontinue the treatment for one year more. Now, this is what the dream\r\nrefers to, for a year is equal to 365 days; the three weeks that remain\r\nbefore the close of the school year and of the treatment are equivalent\r\nto 21 days (though the hours of treatment are not as many as that). The\r\nnumerals, which in the dream thoughts referred to time, are given money\r\nvalues in the dream, not without also giving expression to a deeper\r\nmeaning for \xe2\x80\x9ctime is money.\xe2\x80\x9d 365 kreuzer, to be sure, are _3 florins and\r\n65 kreuzer_. The smallness of the sums which appear in the dream is a\r\nself-evident wish-fulfilment; the wish has reduced the cost of both the\r\ntreatment and the year\xe2\x80\x99s instruction at the institution.\r\n\r\nII. The numerals in another dream involve more complicated relations. A\r\nyoung lady, who, however, has already been married a number of years,\r\nlearns that an acquaintance of hers of about her own age, Elsie L., has\r\njust become engaged. Thereupon she dreams: _She is sitting in the\r\ntheatre with her husband, and one side of the orchestra is quite\r\nunoccupied. Her husband tells her that Elsie L. and her husband had also\r\nwanted to go, but that they had been able to get nothing but poor seats,\r\nthree for 1 florin and 50 kreuzer, and of course they could not take\r\nthose. She thinks that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose much either._\r\n\r\nWhere do the _1 florin and 50 kreuzer_ come from? From an occurrence of\r\nthe previous day which is really indifferent. The dreamer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsister-in-law had received 150 florins as a present from her husband,\r\nand had quickly got rid of them by buying some jewelry. Let us note that\r\n150 florins is 100 times more than 1 florin and 50 kreuzer. Whence the 3\r\nwhich stands before the theatre seats? There is only one association for\r\nthis, namely, that the bride is that many months\xe2\x80\x94three\xe2\x80\x94younger than\r\nherself. Information concerning the significance of the feature that one\r\nside of the orchestra remains empty leads to the solution of the dream.\r\nThis feature is an undisguised allusion to a little occurrence which has\r\ngiven her husband good cause for teasing her. She had decided to go to\r\nthe theatre during the week, and had been careful to get tickets a few\r\ndays before, for which she had to pay the pre-emption charge. When they\r\ngot to the theatre they found that one side of the house was almost\r\nempty; she certainly did not need _to be in such a hurry_.\r\n\r\nI shall now substitute the dream thoughts for the dream: \xe2\x80\x9cIt surely was\r\nnonsense to marry so early; there was _no need for my being in such a\r\nhurry_. From the case of Elsie L., I see that I should have got a\r\nhusband just the same\xe2\x80\x94and one who is a _hundred times_ better (husband,\r\nsweetheart, treasure)\xe2\x80\x94if I had only _waited_ (antithesis to the haste of\r\nher sister-in-law). I could have bought _three_ such men for the money\r\n(the dowry!). Our attention is drawn to the fact that the numerals in\r\nthis dream have changed their meanings and relations to a much greater\r\nextent than in the one previously considered. The transforming and\r\ndisfiguring activity of the dream has in this case been greater, a fact\r\nwhich we interpret as meaning that these dream thoughts had to overcome\r\na particularly great amount of inner psychic resistance up to the point\r\nof their representation. We must also not overlook the circumstance that\r\nthe dream contains an absurd element, namely, that _two_ persons take\r\n_three_ seats. We digress to the interpretation of the absurdity of\r\ndreams when we remark that this absurd detail of the dream content is\r\nintended to represent the most strongly emphasized detail of the dream\r\nthoughts: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was _nonsense_ to marry so early.\xe2\x80\x9d The figure 3 belonging\r\nto a quite subordinate relation of the two compared persons (three\r\nmonths\xe2\x80\x99 difference in age) has thus been skilfully used to produce the\r\nnonsense demanded by the dream. The reduction of the actual 150 florins\r\nto 1 florin and 50 kreuzer corresponds to her disdain of her husband in\r\nthe suppressed thoughts of the dreamer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIII. Another example displays the arithmetical powers of the dream,\r\nwhich have brought it into such disrepute. A man dreams: _He is sitting\r\nat B\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99s_ (a family of his earlier acquaintance) _and says, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\nnonsense for you not to give me Amy in marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d Thereupon he asks the\r\ngirl, \xe2\x80\x9cHow old are you?\xe2\x80\x9d Answer: \xe2\x80\x9cI was born in 1882.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAh, then you are\r\n28 years old.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nSince the dream occurs in the year 1898, this is obviously poor\r\narithmetic, and the inability of the dreamer to calculate may be\r\ncompared to that of the paralytic, if there is no other way of\r\nexplaining it. My patient was one of those persons who are always\r\nthinking about every woman they see. The person who followed him in my\r\noffice, regularly for several months, was a young lady, whom he used to\r\nmeet, about whom he used to ask frequently, and to whom he was very\r\nanxious to be polite. This was the lady whose age he estimated at 28\r\nyears. So much for explaining the result of the apparent calculation.\r\nBut 1882 was the year in which he had married. He had been unable to\r\nrefrain from engaging in conversation with the two females whom he met\r\nat my house\xe2\x80\x94two girls, by no means youthful, who alternately opened the\r\ndoor for him, and as he did not find them very responsive, he had given\r\nhimself the explanation that they probably considered him an elderly\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csettled\xe2\x80\x9d gentleman.\r\n\r\nIV. For another number dream with its interpretation,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ndream distinguished by its obvious determination, or rather\r\nover-determination, I am indebted to B. Dattner:\r\n\r\nMy host, a policeman in the municipal service, dreamed that he was\r\nstanding at his post in the street, which was a wish-realisation. The\r\ninspector then came over to him, having on his gorget the numbers 22 and\r\n62 or 26\xe2\x80\x94at all events there were many two\xe2\x80\x99s on it. Division of the\r\nnumber 2262 in the reproduction of the dream at once points to the fact\r\nthat the components have separate meanings. It occurs to him that the\r\nday before, while on duty, they were discussing the duration of their\r\ntime of service. The occasion for this was furnished by an inspector who\r\nhad been pensioned at 62 years. The dreamer had only completed 22 years\r\nof service, and still needed 2 years and 2 months to make him eligible\r\nfor a 90 per cent. pension. The dream first shows him the fulfilment of\r\na long wished for wish, the rank of inspector. The superior with 2262 on\r\nhis collar is himself; he takes care to do his duty on the street, which\r\nis another preferred wish; he has served his 2 years and 2 months, and\r\ncan now be retired from the service with full pension, like the\r\n62\xe2\x80\x93year-old inspector.\r\n\r\nIf we keep in mind these examples and similar ones (to follow), we may\r\nsay: Dream activity does not calculate at all, whether correctly or\r\nincorrectly; it joins together in the form of a calculation numerals\r\nwhich occur in the dream thoughts, and which may serve as allusions to\r\nmaterial which is incapable of being represented. It thus utilises\r\nnumerals as material for the expression of its purposes in the same\r\nmanner as it does names and speeches known as word presentations.\r\n\r\nFor the dream activity cannot compose a new speech. No matter how many\r\nspeeches and answers may occur in dreams, which may be sensible or\r\nabsurd in themselves, analysis always shows in such cases that the dream\r\nhas only taken from the dream thoughts fragments of speeches which have\r\nbeen delivered or heard, and dealt with them in a most arbitrary manner.\r\nIt has not only torn them from their context and mutilated them, taken\r\nup one piece and rejected another, but it has also joined them together\r\nin a new way, so that the speech which seems coherent in the dream falls\r\ninto three or four sections in the course of analysis. In this new\r\nutilisation of the words, the dream has often put aside the meaning\r\nwhich they had in the dream thoughts, and has derived an entirely new\r\nmeaning from them.[EO] Upon closer inspection the more distinct and\r\ncompact constituents of the dream speech may be distinguished from\r\nothers which serve as connectives and have probably been supplied, just\r\nas we supply omitted letters and syllables in reading. The dream speech\r\nthus has the structure of breccia stones, in which larger pieces of\r\ndifferent material are held together by a solidified cohesive mass.\r\n\r\nIn a very strict sense this description is correct, to be sure, only for\r\nthose speeches in the dream which have something of the sensational\r\ncharacter of a speech, and which are described as \xe2\x80\x9cspeeches.\xe2\x80\x9d The others\r\nwhich have not, as it were, been felt as though heard or spoken (which\r\nhave no accompanying acoustic or motor emphasis in the dream) are simply\r\nthoughts such as occur in our waking thought activity, and are\r\ntransferred without change into many dreams. Our reading, also, seems to\r\nfurnish an abundant and not easily traceable source of material for\r\nspeeches, this material being of an indifferent nature. Everything,\r\nhowever, which appears conspicuously in the dream as a speech can be\r\nreferred to real speeches which have been made or heard by the dreamer\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nWe have already found examples for the explanation of such dream\r\nspeeches in the analysis of dreams cited for other purposes. Here is one\r\nexample in place of many, all of which lead to the same conclusion.\r\n\r\n_A large courtyard in which corpses are cremated. The dreamer says: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing away from here, I can\xe2\x80\x99t look at this.\xe2\x80\x9d_ (Not a distinct speech.)\r\n_Then he meets two butcher boys and asks: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, did it taste good?\xe2\x80\x9d One\r\nof them answers: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good.\xe2\x80\x9d As though it had been human\r\nflesh._\r\n\r\nThe harmless occasion for this dream is as follows: After taking supper\r\nwith his wife, the dreamer pays a visit to his worthy but by no means\r\nappetising neighbour. The hospitable old lady is just at her evening\r\nmeal, and _urges_ him (instead of this word a composite\r\nsexually-significant word is jocosely used among men) to taste of it. He\r\ndeclines, saying that he has no appetite. \xe2\x80\x9c_Go on_, you can stand some\r\nmore,\xe2\x80\x9d or something of the kind. The dreamer is thus forced to taste and\r\npraise what is offered. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s good!\xe2\x80\x9d After he is alone again with\r\nhis wife, he scolds about the neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s importunity and about the\r\nquality of the food he has tasted. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stand the sight of it,\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\nphrase not appearing even in the dream as an actual speech, is a thought\r\nwhich has reference to the physical charms of the lady who invites him,\r\nand which would be translated as meaning that he does not want to look\r\nat her.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of another dream which I cite at this point for the sake of\r\nthe very distinct speech that forms its nucleus, but which I shall\r\nexplain only when we come to consider emotions in the dream\xe2\x80\x94will be more\r\ninstructive. I dream very distinctly: _I have gone to Bruecke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlaboratory at night, and upon hearing a soft knocking at the door, I\r\nopen it to (the deceased) Professor Fleischl, who enters in the company\r\nof several strangers, and after saying a few words sits down at his\r\ntable._ Then follows a second dream: _My friend Fl. has come to Vienna\r\nin July without attracting much attention; I meet him on the street\r\nwhile he is in conversation with my_ (deceased) _friend P., and I go\r\nsomewhere or other with these two, and they sit down opposite each other\r\nas though at a little table, while I sit at the narrow end of the table\r\nfacing them. Fl. tells about his sister and says: \xe2\x80\x9cIn three-quarters of\r\nan hour she was dead,\xe2\x80\x9d and then something like: \xe2\x80\x9cThat is the threshold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAs P. does not understand him, Fl. turns to me, and asks me how much I\r\nhave told of his affairs. Whereupon, seized by strange emotions, I want\r\nto tell Fl. that P._ (can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly know anything because he) _is not\r\nalive. But, noticing the mistake myself, I say: \xe2\x80\x9cNon vixit.\xe2\x80\x9d Then I look\r\nat P. searchingly, and under my gaze he becomes pale and blurred, his\r\neyes a morbid blue\xe2\x80\x94and at last he dissolves. I rejoice greatly at this;\r\nI now understand that Ernest Fleischl, too, was only an apparition, a\r\nrevenant, and I find that it is quite possible for such a person to\r\nexist only as long as one wants him to, and that he can be made to\r\ndisappear by the wish of another person._\r\n\r\nThis beautiful dream unites so many of the characteristics of the dream\r\ncontent which are problematic\xe2\x80\x94the criticism made in the dream itself in\r\nthat I myself notice my mistake in having said \xe2\x80\x9cNon vixit\xe2\x80\x9d instead of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNon vivit\xe2\x80\x9d; the unconstrained intercourse with dead persons, whom the\r\ndream itself declares to be dead; the absurdity of the inference and the\r\nintense satisfaction which the inference gives me\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9cby my life\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nshould like to give a complete solution of these problems. But in\r\nreality I am incapable of doing this\xe2\x80\x94namely, the thing I do in the\r\ndream\xe2\x80\x94of sacrificing such dear persons to my ambition. With every\r\nrevelation of the true meaning of the dream, with which I am well\r\nacquainted, I should have been put to shame. Hence I am content with\r\nselecting a few of the elements of the dream, for interpretation, some\r\nhere, and others later on another page.\r\n\r\nThe scene in which I annihilate P. by a glance forms the centre of the\r\ndream. His eyes become strange and weirdly blue, and then he dissolves.\r\nThis scene is an unmistakable copy of one really experienced. I was a\r\ndemonstrator at the physiological institute, and began my service in the\r\nearly hours, and _Bruecke_ learned that I had been late several times in\r\ngetting to the school laboratory. So one morning he came promptly for\r\nthe opening of the class and waited for me. What he said to me was brief\r\nand to the point; but the words did not matter at all. What overwhelmed\r\nme was the terrible blue eyes through which he looked at me and before\r\nwhich I melted away\xe2\x80\x94as P. does in the dream, for P. has changed r\xc3\xb4les\r\nwith him much to my relief. Anyone who remembers the eyes of the great\r\nmaster, which were wonderfully beautiful until old age, and who has ever\r\nseen him in anger, can easily imagine the emotions of the young\r\ntransgressor on that occasion.\r\n\r\nBut for a long time I was unable to account for the \xe2\x80\x9cNon Vixit,\xe2\x80\x9d with\r\nwhich I execute sentence in the dream, until I remembered that these two\r\nwords possessed such great distinctness in the dream, not because they\r\nwere heard or spoken, but because they were _seen_. Then I knew at once\r\nwhere they came from. On the pedestal of the statue of Emperor Joseph in\r\nthe Hofburg at Vienna, may be read the following beautiful words:\r\n\r\n                         Saluti patriae _vixit\r\n                         non_ diu sed totus.\r\n\r\nI had culled from this inscription something which suited the one\r\ninimical train of thought in the dream thoughts and which now intended\r\nto mean: \xe2\x80\x9cThat fellow has nothing to say, he is not living at all.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nI now recalled that the dream was dreamed a few days after the unveiling\r\nof the memorial to _Fleischl_ in the arcades of the university, upon\r\nwhich occasion I had again seen _Bruecke\xe2\x80\x99s_ statue and must have thought\r\nwith regret (in the unconscious) how my highly gifted friend P. with his\r\ngreat devotion to science had forfeited his just claim to a statue in\r\nthese halls by his premature death. So I set up this memorial to him in\r\nthe dream; the first name of my friend P. is Joseph.[EP]\r\n\r\nAccording to the rules of dream interpretation, I should still not be\r\njustified in replacing _non vivit_, which I need, by _non vixit_, which\r\nis placed at my disposal by the recollection of the Joseph monument.\r\nSomething now calls my attention to the fact that in the dream scene,\r\ntwo trains of thought concerning my friend P. meet, one hostile, the\r\nother friendly\xe2\x80\x94of which the former is superficial, the latter veiled,\r\nand both are given representation in the same words: _non vixit_.\r\nBecause my friend P. has deserved well of science, I erect a statue to\r\nhim; but because he has been guilty of an evil wish (which is expressed\r\nat the end of the dream) I destroy him. I have here constructed a\r\nsentence of peculiar resonance, and I must have been influenced by some\r\nmodel. But where can I find similar antithesis, such a parallel between\r\ntwo opposite attitudes towards the same person, both claiming to be\r\nentirely valid, and yet both trying not to encroach upon each other?\r\nSuch a parallel is to be found in a single place, where, however, a deep\r\nimpression is made upon the reader\xe2\x80\x94in Brutus\xe2\x80\x99 speech of justification in\r\nShakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s _Julius C\xc3\xa6sar_: \xe2\x80\x9cAs C\xc3\xa6sar loved me, I weep for him; as he\r\nwas fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was valiant, I honour him; but, as\r\nhe was ambitious, I slew him.\xe2\x80\x9d Is not this which I have discovered, the\r\nsame sentence structure and thought contrast as in the dream thought? I\r\nthus play Brutus in the dream. If I could only find in the dream\r\nthoughts, one further trace of confirmation for this astonishing\r\ncollateral connection! I think the following might be such: My friend\r\ncomes to Vienna in _July_. This detail finds no support whatever in\r\nreality. To my knowledge my friend has never been in Vienna during the\r\nmonth of _July_. But the month of _July_ is named after _Julius C\xc3\xa6sar_,\r\nand might therefore very well furnish the required allusion to the\r\nintermediary thought that I am playing the part of Brutus.[EQ]\r\n\r\nStrangely enough I once actually played the part of Brutus. I presented\r\nthe scene between Brutus and C\xc3\xa6sar from Schiller\xe2\x80\x99s poems to an audience\r\nof children when I was a boy of fourteen years. I did this with my\r\nnephew, who was a year older than I, and who had come to us from\r\nEngland\xe2\x80\x94also a _revenant_\xe2\x80\x94for in him I recognised the playmate of my\r\nfirst childish years. Until the end of my third year we had been\r\ninseparable, had loved each other and scuffled with each other, and, as\r\nI have already intimated, this childish relation has constantly\r\ndetermined my later feelings in my intercourse with persons of my own\r\nage. My nephew John has since found many incarnations, which have\r\nrevivified first one aspect, then another, of this character which is so\r\nineradicably fixed in my unconscious memory. Occasionally he must have\r\ntreated me very badly and I must have shown courage before my tyrant,\r\nfor in later years I have often been told of the short speech with which\r\nI vindicated myself when my father\xe2\x80\x94his grandfather\xe2\x80\x94called me to account:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hit him because he hit me.\xe2\x80\x9d This childish scene must be the one which\r\ncauses _non vivit_ to branch off into _non vixit_, for in the language\r\nof later childhood striking is called _wichsen_ (German, _wichsen_\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nsmear with shoe-polish, to tan, _i.e._, to flog); the dream activity\r\ndoes not hesitate to take advantage of such connections. My hostility\r\ntowards my friend P., which has so little foundation in reality\xe2\x80\x94he was\r\nfar superior to me, and might therefore have been a new edition of the\r\nplaymate of my childhood\xe2\x80\x94can certainly be traced to my complicated\r\nrelations with John during our infancy. I shall, however, return to this\r\ndream later.\r\n\r\n\r\n      (_f_) _Absurd Dreams\xe2\x80\x94Intellectual Performances in the Dream_\r\n\r\nIn our interpretation of dreams thus far we have come upon the element\r\nof _absurdity_ in the dream-content so often that we must no longer\r\npostpone an investigation of its cause and significance. We remember, of\r\ncourse, that the absurdity of dreams has furnished the opponents of\r\ndream investigation with their chief argument for considering the dream\r\nnothing but the meaningless product of a reduced and fragmentary\r\nactivity of the mind.\r\n\r\nI begin with specimens in which the absurdity of the dream-content is\r\nonly apparent and immediately disappears when the dream is more\r\nthoroughly examined. There are a few dreams which\xe2\x80\x94accidentally one is at\r\nfirst inclined to think\xe2\x80\x94are concerned with the dead father of the\r\ndreamer.\r\n\r\nI. Here is the dream of a patient who had lost his father six years\r\nbefore:\r\n\r\n_A terrible accident has occurred to his father. He was riding in the\r\nnight train when a derailment took place, the seats came together, and\r\nhis head was crushed from side to side. The dreamer sees him lying on\r\nthe bed with a wound over his left eyebrow, which runs off vertically.\r\nThe dreamer is surprised that his father has had a misfortune (since he\r\nis dead already, as the dreamer adds in telling his dream). His father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes are so clear._\r\n\r\nAccording to the standards prevailing in dream criticism, this\r\ndream-content would have to be explained in the following manner: At\r\nfirst, when the dreamer is picturing his father\xe2\x80\x99s misfortune, he has\r\nforgotten that his father has already been in his grave for years; in\r\nthe further course of the dream this memory comes to life, and causes\r\nhim to be surprised at his own dream even while he is still dreaming.\r\nAnalysis, however, teaches us that it is entirely useless to attempt\r\nsuch explanations. The dreamer had given an artist an order for a bust\r\nof his father, which he had inspected two days before the dream. This is\r\nthe thing which seems to him to have met with an _accident_. The\r\nsculptor has never seen the father, and is working from photographs\r\nwhich have been given him. On the very day before the dream the pious\r\nson had sent an old servant of the family to the studio in order to see\r\nwhether he would pass the same judgment upon the marble head, namely,\r\nthat it had turned out too _narrow from side to side_, from temple to\r\ntemple. Now follows the mass of recollections which has contributed to\r\nthe formation of this dream. The dreamer\xe2\x80\x99s father had a habit, whenever\r\nhe was harassed by business cares or family difficulties, of pressing\r\nhis temples with both hands, as though he were trying to compress his\r\nhead, which seemed to grow too large for him. When our dreamer was four\r\nyears old he was present when the accidental discharge of a pistol\r\nblackened his father\xe2\x80\x99s eyes (_his eyes are so clear_). While alive his\r\nfather had had a deep wrinkle at the place where the dream shows the\r\ninjury, whenever he was thoughtful or sad. The fact that in the dream\r\nthis wrinkle is replaced by a wound points to the second occasion of the\r\ndream. The dreamer had taken a photograph of his little daughter; the\r\nplate had fallen from his hand, and when picked up showed a crack that\r\nran like a vertical furrow across the forehead and reached as far as the\r\norbital curve. He could not then get the better of his superstitious\r\nforebodings, for, on the day before his mother\xe2\x80\x99s death, a photographic\r\nplate with her likeness had cracked as he was handling it.\r\n\r\nThus the absurdity of the dream is only the result of an inaccuracy of\r\nverbal expression, which does not take the trouble to distinguish the\r\nbust and the photograph from the original. We are all accustomed to say\r\nof a picture, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think father is good?\xe2\x80\x9d Of course the appearance\r\nof absurdity in this dream might easily have been avoided. If it were\r\npermissible to pass judgment after a single experience, one might be\r\ntempted to say that this semblance of absurdity is admitted or desired.\r\n\r\nII. Here is another very similar example from my own dreams (I lost my\r\nfather in the year 1896):\r\n\r\n_After his death my father has been politically active among the\r\nMagyars, and has united them into a political body_; to accompany which\r\nI see a little indistinct picture: _a crowd of people as in the\r\nReichstag; a person who is standing on one or two benches, others round\r\nabout him. I remember that he looked very like Garibaldi on his\r\ndeath-bed, and I am glad that this promise has really come true._\r\n\r\nThis is certainly absurd enough. It was dreamed at the time that the\r\nHungarians got into a lawless condition, through Parliamentary\r\nobstruction, and passed through the crisis from which Koloman Szell\r\ndelivered them. The trivial circumstance that the scene beheld in the\r\ndream consists of such little pictures is not without significance for\r\nthe explanation of this element. The usual visual representation of our\r\nthoughts results in pictures which impress us as being life-size; my\r\ndream picture, however, is the reproduction of a wood-cut inserted in\r\nthe text of an illustrated history of Austria, representing Maria\r\nTheresa in the Reichstag of Pressburg\xe2\x80\x94the famous scene of \xe2\x80\x9cMoriamur pro\r\nrege nostro.\xe2\x80\x9d[ER] Like Maria Theresa, my father, in the dream, stands\r\nsurrounded by the multitude; but he is standing on one or two benches,\r\nand thus like a judge on the bench. (He has _united_ them\xe2\x80\x94here the\r\nintermediary is the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall need no _judge_.\xe2\x80\x9d) Those of us who\r\nstood around the death-bed of my father actually noticed that he looked\r\nmuch like Garibaldi. He had a _post-mortem_ rise of temperature, his\r\ncheeks shone redder and redder ... involuntarily we continue: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nbehind him lay in phantom radiance that which subdues us all\xe2\x80\x94the common\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis elevation of our thoughts prepares us for having to deal with this\r\nvery \xe2\x80\x9ccommon thing.\xe2\x80\x9d The _post-mortem_ feature of the rise in\r\ntemperature corresponds to the words, \xe2\x80\x9cafter his death\xe2\x80\x9d in the dream\r\ncontent. The most agonising of his sufferings had been a complete\r\nparalysis of the intestines (_obstruction_), which set in during the\r\nlast weeks. All sorts of disrespectful thoughts are connected with this.\r\nA man of my own age who had lost his father while he was still at the\r\nGymnasium, upon which occasion I was profoundly moved and tendered him\r\nmy friendship, once told me, with derision, about the distress of a lady\r\nrelative whose father had died on the street and had been brought home,\r\nwhere it turned out upon undressing the corpse, that at the moment of\r\ndeath, or _post-mortem_, an evacuation of the bowels had taken place.\r\nThe daughter of the dead man was profoundly unhappy at having this ugly\r\ndetail stain her memory of her father. We have now penetrated to the\r\nwish that is embodied in this dream. _To stand before one\xe2\x80\x99s children\r\npure and great after one\xe2\x80\x99s death_, who would not wish that? What has\r\nbecome of the absurdity of the dream? The appearance of it has been\r\ncaused only by the fact that a perfectly permissible mode of speech\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthe case of which we are accustomed to ignore the absurdity that happens\r\nto exist between its parts\xe2\x80\x94has been faithfully represented in the dream.\r\nHere, too, we are unable to deny that the semblance of absurdity is one\r\nwhich is desired and has been purposely brought about.[ES]\r\n\r\nIII. In the example which I now cite I can detect the dream activity in\r\nthe act of purposely manufacturing an absurdity for which there is no\r\noccasion at all in the subject-matter. It is taken from the dream that I\r\nhad as a result of meeting Count Thun before my vacation trip. \xe2\x80\x9c_I am\r\nriding in a one-horse carriage, and give orders to drive to a railway\r\nstation. \xe2\x80\x98Of course I cannot ride with you on the railway line itself,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI say, after the driver made an objection as though I had tired him out;\r\nat the same time it seems as though I had already driven with him for a\r\ndistance which one usually rides on the train._\xe2\x80\x9d For this confused and\r\nsenseless story the analysis gives the following explanation: During the\r\nday I had hired a one-horse carriage which was to take me to a remote\r\nstreet in Dornbach. The driver, however, did not know the way, and kept\r\non driving in the manner of those good people until I noticed the fact\r\nand showed him the way, not sparing him a few mocking remarks withal.\r\nFrom this driver a train of thought led to the aristocratic personage\r\nwhom I was destined to meet later. For the present I shall only remark\r\nthat what strikes us middle-class plebeians about the aristocracy is\r\nthat they like to put themselves in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat. Does not Count\r\nThun guide the Austrian car of state? The next sentence in the dream,\r\nhowever, refers to my brother, whom I identify with the driver of the\r\none-horse carriage. I had this year refused to take the trip through\r\nItaly with him (\xe2\x80\x9cof course I cannot ride with you on the railway line\r\nitself\xe2\x80\x9d), and this refusal was a sort of punishment for his wonted\r\ncomplaint that I usually tired him out on this trip (which gets into the\r\ndream unchanged) by making him take hurried trips and see too many nice\r\nthings in one day. That evening my brother had accompanied me to the\r\nrailroad station, but shortly before getting there had jumped out, at\r\nthe state railway division of the Western Station, in order to take a\r\ntrain to Purkersdorf. I remarked to him that he could stay with me a\r\nlittle longer, inasmuch as he did not go to Purkersdorf by the state\r\nrailway but by the Western Railway. This is how it happens that in the\r\ndream I rode in the wagon a distance _which one usually rides on the\r\ntrain_. In reality, however, it was just the opposite; I told my\r\nbrother: The distance which you ride on the state railway you could ride\r\nin my company on the Western Railway. The whole confusion of the dream\r\nis therefore produced by my inserting in the dream the word \xe2\x80\x9cwagon\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninstead of \xe2\x80\x9cstate railway,\xe2\x80\x9d which, to be sure, does good service in\r\nbringing together the driver and my brother. I then find in the dream\r\nsome nonsense which seems hardly straightened out by my explanation, and\r\nwhich almost forms a contradiction to my earlier speech (\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\r\ncannot ride with you on the railway line itself\xe2\x80\x9d). But as I have no\r\noccasion whatever for confounding the state railway with the one-horse\r\ncarriage, I must have intentionally formed the whole puzzling story in\r\nthe dream in this way.\r\n\r\nBut with what intention? We shall now learn what the absurdity in the\r\ndream signifies, and the motives which admitted it or created it. The\r\nsolution of the mystery in the case in question is as follows: In the\r\ndream I needed something absurd and incomprehensible in connection with\r\n\xe2\x80\x9criding\xe2\x80\x9d (Fahren) because in the dream thoughts I had a certain judgment\r\nwhich required representation. On an evening at the house of the\r\nhospitable and clever lady who appears in another scene of the same\r\ndream as the \xe2\x80\x9chostess,\xe2\x80\x9d I heard two riddles which I could not solve. As\r\nthey were known to the other members of the party, I presented a\r\nsomewhat ludicrous figure in my unsuccessful attempts to find a\r\nsolution. They were two equivoques turning on the words \xe2\x80\x9cNachkommen\xe2\x80\x9d (to\r\ncome after\xe2\x80\x94offspring) and \xe2\x80\x9cvorfahren\xe2\x80\x9d (to ride in advance\xe2\x80\x94forefathers,\r\nancestry). They read as follows:\r\n\r\n                The coachman does it\r\n                  At the master\xe2\x80\x99s behest;\r\n                Everyone has it,\r\n                  In the grave does it rest.\r\n                                            (Ancestry.)\r\n\r\nIt was confusing to find half of the second riddle identical with the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n                The coachman does it\r\n                  At the master\xe2\x80\x99s behest;\r\n                Not everyone has it,\r\n                  In the cradle does it rest.\r\n                                            (Offspring.)\r\n\r\nAs I had seen Count Thun ride in advance (vorfahren), so high and\r\nmighty, and had merged into the Figaro-mood which finds the merit of\r\naristocratic gentlemen in the fact that they have taken the trouble to\r\nbe born (Nachkommen\xe2\x80\x94to become offspring), the two riddles became\r\nintermediary thoughts for the dream-work. As aristocrats can be readily\r\nconfounded with coachmen, and as coachmen were in our country formerly\r\ncalled brothers-in-law, the work of condensation could employ my brother\r\nin the same representation. But the dream thought at work in the\r\nbackground was as follows: _It is nonsense to be proud of one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nancestry. (Vorfahren.) I would rather be myself an ancestor. (Vorfahr.)_\r\nFor the sake of this judgment, \xe2\x80\x9cit is nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d we have the nonsense in\r\nthe dream. We can now also solve the last riddle in this obscure passage\r\nof the dream, namely, that I have already driven before (vorher\r\ngefahren, vorgefahren) with the coachman.\r\n\r\nThus the dream is made absurd if there occurs as one of the elements in\r\nthe dream thoughts the judgment \xe2\x80\x9c_That is nonsense_,\xe2\x80\x9d and in general if\r\ndisdain and criticism are the motives for one of the trains of\r\nunconscious thought. Hence absurdity becomes one of the means by which\r\nthe dream activity expresses contradiction, as it does by reversing a\r\nrelation in the material between the dream thoughts and dream content,\r\nand by utilising sensations of motor impediment. But absurdity in the\r\ndream is not simply to be translated by \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d; it is rather intended to\r\nreproduce the disposition of the dream thoughts, this being to show\r\nmockery and ridicule along with the contradiction. It is only for this\r\npurpose that the dream activity produces anything ridiculous. Here again\r\nit transforms _a part of the latent content into a manifest form_.[ET]\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact we have already met with a convincing example of the\r\nsignificance of an absurd dream. The dream, interpreted without\r\nanalysis, of the Wagnerian performance lasting until 7.45 in the\r\nmorning, in which the orchestra is conducted from a tower, &c. (see p.\r\n316) is apparently trying to say: It is a _crazy_ world and an _insane_\r\nsociety. He who deserves a thing doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get it, and he who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nfor anything has it\xe2\x80\x94and in this she means to compare her fate with that\r\nof her cousin. The fact that dreams concerning a dead father were the\r\nfirst to furnish us with examples of absurdity in dreams is by no means\r\nan accident. The conditions necessary for the creations of absurd dreams\r\nare here grouped together in a typical manner. The authority belonging\r\nto the father has at an early age aroused the criticism of the child,\r\nand the strict demands he has made have caused the child to pay\r\nparticularly close attention to every weakness of the father for its own\r\nextenuation; but the piety with which the father\xe2\x80\x99s personality is\r\nsurrounded in our thoughts, especially after his death, increases the\r\ncensorship which prevents the expressions of this criticism from\r\nbecoming conscious.\r\n\r\nIV. The following is another absurd dream about a dead father:\r\n\r\n_I receive a notice from the common council of my native city concerning\r\nthe costs of a confinement in the hospital in the year 1851, which was\r\nnecessitated by an attack from which I suffered. I make sport of the\r\nmatter, for, in the first place, I was not yet alive in the year 1851,\r\nand, in the second place, my father, to whom the notice might refer, is\r\nalready dead. I go to him in the adjoining room, where he is lying on a\r\nbed, and tell him about it. To my astonishment he recalls that in that\r\nyear\xe2\x80\x941851\xe2\x80\x94he was once drunk and had to be locked up or confined. It was\r\nwhen he was working for the house of T\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you drank, too?\xe2\x80\x9d I ask.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou married soon after?\xe2\x80\x9d I figure that I was born in 1856, which\r\nappears to me as though immediately following._\r\n\r\nIn view of the preceding discussion, we shall translate the insistence\r\nwith which this dream exhibits its absurdities as the sure sign of a\r\nparticularly embittered and passionate controversy in the dream\r\nthoughts. With all the more astonishment, however, we note that in this\r\ndream the controversy is waged openly, and the father designated as the\r\nperson against whom the satire is directed. This openness seems to\r\ncontradict our assumption of a censor as operative in the dream\r\nactivity. We may say in explanation, however, that here the father is\r\nonly an interposed person, while the conflict is carried on with another\r\none, who makes his appearance in the dream by means of a single\r\nallusion. While the dream usually treats of revolt against other\r\npersons, behind which the father is concealed, the reverse is true here;\r\nthe father serves as the man of straw to represent others, and hence the\r\ndream dares thus openly to concern itself with a person who is usually\r\nhallowed, because there is present the certain knowledge that he is not\r\nin reality intended. We learn of this condition of affairs by\r\nconsidering the occasion of the dream. Now, it occurred after I had\r\nheard that an older colleague, whose judgment is considered infallible,\r\nhad expressed disapproval and astonishment at the fact that one of my\r\npatients was then continuing psychoanalytical work with me for the fifth\r\nyear. The introductory sentences of the dream point with transparent\r\ndisguise to the fact that this colleague had for a time taken over the\r\nduties which my father could no longer perform (_expenses, fees at the\r\nhospital_); and when our friendly relations came to be broken I was\r\nthrown into the same conflict of feelings which arises in the case of\r\nmisunderstanding between father and son in view of the part played by\r\nthe father and his earlier functions. The dream thoughts now bitterly\r\nresent the reproach that I _am not making better progress_, which\r\nextends itself from the treatment of this patient to other things. Does\r\nthis colleague know anyone who can get on faster? Does he not know that\r\nconditions of this sort are usually incurable and last for life? What\r\nare four or five years in comparison to a whole life, especially when\r\nlife has been made so much easier for the patient during the treatment?\r\n\r\nThe impression of absurdity in this dream is brought about largely by\r\nthe fact that sentences from different divisions of the dream thoughts\r\nare strung together without any reconciling transition. Thus the\r\nsentence, _I go to him in the adjoining room, &c._, leaves the subject\r\ndealt with in the preceding sentences, and faithfully reproduces the\r\ncircumstances under which I told my father about my marriage engagement.\r\nThus the dream is trying to remind me of the noble disinterestedness\r\nwhich the old man showed at that time, and to put it in contrast with\r\nthe conduct of another, a new person. I now perceive that the dream is\r\nallowed to make sport of my father for the reason that in the dream\r\nthought he is held up as an example to another man, in full recognition\r\nof his merit. It is in the nature of every censorship that it permits\r\nthe telling of untruth about forbidden things rather than truth. The\r\nnext sentence, in which my father remembers having _once been drunk_,\r\nand having been _locked up for it_, also contains nothing which is\r\nactually true of my father. The person whom he covers is here a no less\r\nimportant one than the great Meynert, in whose footsteps I followed with\r\nsuch great veneration, and whose attitude towards me was changed into\r\nundisguised hostility after a short period of indulgence. The dream\r\nrecalls to me his own statement that in his youth he was addicted to the\r\n_chloroform_ habit, and that for this he had to enter a sanatorium. It\r\nrecalls also a second experience with him shortly before his death. I\r\ncarried on an embittered literary controversy with him concerning\r\nhysteria in the male, the existence of which he denied, and when I\r\nvisited him in his last illness and asked him how he felt, he dwelt upon\r\nthe details of his condition and concluded with the words: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I\r\nhave always been one of the prettiest cases of masculine hysteria.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThus, to my satisfaction, and _to my astonishment_, he admitted what he\r\nhad so long and so stubbornly opposed. But the fact that in this scene I\r\ncan use my father to cover Meynert is based not upon the analogy which\r\nhas been found to exist between the two persons, but upon the slight,\r\nbut quite adequate, representation of a conditional sentence occurring\r\nin the dream thoughts, which in full would read as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course\r\nif I were of the second generation, the son of a professor or of a\r\ncourt-councillor, I should have _progressed more rapidly_.\xe2\x80\x9d In the dream\r\nI now make a court-councillor and a professor of my father. The most\r\nobvious and most annoying absurdity of the dream lies in the treatment\r\nof the date 1851, which seems to me to be hardly distinguishable from\r\n1856, as though _a difference of five years would signify nothing\r\nwhatever_. But it is just this idea of the dream thoughts which requires\r\nexpression. _Four or five years_\xe2\x80\x94that is the length of time which I\r\nenjoyed the support of the colleague mentioned at the outset; but it is\r\nalso the time during which I kept my bride waiting before I married her;\r\nand, through a coincidence that is eagerly taken advantage of by the\r\ndream thoughts, it is also the time during which I am now keeping one of\r\nmy best patients waiting for the completion of his cure. \xe2\x80\x9c_What are five\r\nyears?_\xe2\x80\x9d ask the dream thoughts. \xe2\x80\x9c_That is no time at all for me\xe2\x80\x94that\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t come into consideration._ I have time enough ahead of me, and\r\njust as what you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to believe came true at last, so I shall\r\naccomplish this also.\xe2\x80\x9d Besides the number 51, when separated from the\r\nnumber of the century, is determined in still another manner and in an\r\nopposite sense; for which reason it occurs in the dream again. Fifty-one\r\nis an age at which a man seems particularly exposed to danger, at which\r\nI have seen many of my colleagues suddenly die, and among them one who\r\nhad been appointed to a professorship a few days before, after he had\r\nbeen waiting a long time.\r\n\r\nV. Another absurd dream which plays with figures, runs as follows:\r\n\r\n_One of my acquaintances, Mr. M., has been attacked in an essay by no\r\nless a person than Goethe, with justifiable vehemence, we all think. Mr.\r\nM. has, of course, been crushed by this attack. He complains of it\r\nbitterly at a dinner party; but he says that his veneration for Goethe\r\nhas not suffered from this personal experience. I try to find some\r\nexplanation of the chronological relations, which seem improbable to me.\r\nGoethe died in 1832; since his attack upon M. must of course have taken\r\nplace earlier, Mr. M. was at the time a very young man. It seems\r\nplausible to me that he was 18 years old. But I do not know exactly what\r\nyear it is at present, and so the whole calculation lapses into\r\nobscurity. The attack, moreover, is contained in Goethe\xe2\x80\x99s well-known\r\nessay entitled \xe2\x80\x9cNature.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nWe shall soon find means to justify the nonsense of this dream. Mr. M.,\r\nwith whom I became acquainted _at a dinner-party_, had recently\r\nrequested me to examine his brother, who showed signs of _paralytic\r\ninsanity_. The conjecture was right; the painful thing about this visit\r\nwas that the patient exposed his brother by alluding to his youthful\r\npranks when there was no occasion in the conversation for his doing so.\r\nI had asked the patient to tell me the year of his birth, and had got\r\nhim to make several small calculations in order to bring out the\r\nweakness of his memory\xe2\x80\x94all of which tests he passed fairly well. I see\r\nnow that I am acting like a paralytic in the dream (_I do not know\r\nexactly what year it is at present_). Other subject-matter in the dream\r\nis drawn from another recent source. The editor of a medical journal, a\r\nfriend of mine, had accepted for his paper a very unfavourable, a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_crushing_,\xe2\x80\x9d criticism of the last book of my friend Fl. of Berlin, the\r\nauthor of which was a very _youthful_ reviewer, who was not very\r\ncompetent to pass judgment. I thought I had a right to interfere, and\r\ncalled the editor to account; he keenly regretted the acceptance of the\r\ncriticism, but would not promise redress. Thereupon I broke off\r\nrelations with the journal, and in my letter of resignation expressed\r\nthe hope that _our personal relations would not suffer from the\r\nincident_. The third source of this dream is an account given by a\r\nfemale patient\xe2\x80\x94it was fresh in my memory at the time\xe2\x80\x94of the mental\r\ndisease of her brother who had fallen into a frenzy, crying \xe2\x80\x9cNature,\r\nNature.\xe2\x80\x9d The physicians in attendance thought that the cry was derived\r\nfrom a reading of Goethe\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful _essay_, and that it pointed to\r\noverwork in the patient in the study of natural philosophy. I thought\r\nrather of the sexual sense in which even less cultured people with us\r\nuse the word \xe2\x80\x9cNature,\xe2\x80\x9d and the fact that the unfortunate man later\r\nmutilated his genitals seemed to show that I was not far wrong. Eighteen\r\nyears was the age of this patient at the time when the attack of frenzy\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nIf I add further that the book of my friend so severely criticised (\xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis a question whether the author is crazy or we are\xe2\x80\x9d had been the\r\nopinion of another critic) treats of the _temporal relations of life_\r\nand refers the duration of Goethe\xe2\x80\x99s life to the multiple of a number\r\nsignificant from the point of view of biology, it will readily be\r\nadmitted that I am putting myself in the place of my friend in the\r\ndream. (_I try to find some explanation of the chronological\r\nrelations._) But I behave like a paralytic, and the dream revels in\r\nabsurdity. This means, then, as the dream thoughts say ironically. \xe2\x80\x9cOf\r\ncourse he is the fool, the lunatic, and you are the man of genius who\r\nknows better. Perhaps, however, it is the other way around?\xe2\x80\x9d Now, this\r\nother way around is explicitly represented in the dream, in that Goethe\r\nhas attacked the young man, which is absurd, while it is perfectly\r\npossible even to-day for a young fellow to attack the immortal Goethe,\r\nand in that I figure from the year of Goethe\xe2\x80\x99s death, while I caused the\r\nparalytic to calculate from the year of his birth.\r\n\r\nBut I have already promised to show that every dream is the result of\r\negotistical motives. Accordingly, I must account for the fact that in\r\nthis dream I make my friend\xe2\x80\x99s cause my own and put myself in his place.\r\nMy rational conviction in waking thought is not adequate to do this.\r\nNow, the story of the eighteen-year-old patient and of the various\r\ninterpretations of his cry, \xe2\x80\x9cNature,\xe2\x80\x9d alludes to my having brought\r\nmyself into opposition to most physicians by claiming sexual etiology\r\nfor the psychoneuroses. I may say to myself: \xe2\x80\x9cThe same kind of criticism\r\nyour friend met with you will meet with too, and have already met with\r\nto some extent,\xe2\x80\x9d and now I may replace the \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x9d in the dream thoughts by\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you are right; we two are the fools.\xe2\x80\x9d That _mea res agitur_,\r\nis clearly shown by the mention of the short, incomparably beautiful\r\nessay of Goethe, for it was a public reading of this essay which induced\r\nme to study the natural science while I was still undecided in the\r\ngraduating class of the Gymnasium.\r\n\r\nVI. I am also bound to show of another dream in which my ego does not\r\noccur that it is egotistic. On page 228 I mentioned a short dream in\r\nwhich Professor M. says: \xe2\x80\x9cMy son, the myopic ...\xe2\x80\x9d; and I stated that\r\nthis was only a preliminary dream to another one, in which I play a\r\npart. Here is the main dream, omitted above, which challenges us to\r\nexplain its absurd and unintelligible word-formation.\r\n\r\n_On account of some happenings or other in the city of Rome it is\r\nnecessary for the children to flee, and this they do. The scene is then\r\nlaid before a gate, a two-winged gate in antique style (the Porta Romana\r\nin Siena, as I know while I am still dreaming). I am sitting on the edge\r\nof a well, and am very sad; I almost weep. A feminine person\xe2\x80\x94nurse,\r\nnun\xe2\x80\x94brings out the two boys and hands them over to their father, who is\r\nnot myself. The elder of the two is distinctly my eldest son, and I do\r\nnot see the face of the other; the woman who brings the boy asks him for\r\na parting kiss. She is distinguished by a red nose. The boy denies her\r\nthe kiss, but says to her, extending his hand to her in parting, \xe2\x80\x9cAuf\r\nGeseres,\xe2\x80\x9d and to both of us (or to one of us) \xe2\x80\x9cAuf Ungeseres.\xe2\x80\x9d I have\r\nthe idea, that the latter indicates an advantage._\r\n\r\nThis dream is built upon a tangle of thoughts induced by a play I saw at\r\nthe theatre, called _Das neue Ghetto_ (\xe2\x80\x9cThe New Ghetto.\xe2\x80\x9d) The Jewish\r\nquestion, anxiety about the future of my children who cannot be given a\r\nnative country of their own, anxiety about bringing them up so that they\r\nmay have the right of native citizens\xe2\x80\x94all these features may easily be\r\nrecognised in the accompanying dream thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe sat by the waters of Babylon and wept.\xe2\x80\x9d Siena, like Rome, is famous\r\nfor its beautiful fountains. In the dream I must find a substitute of\r\nsome kind for Rome (_cf._ p. 163) in localities which are known to me.\r\nNear the Porta Romana of Siena we saw a large, brightly illuminated\r\nbuilding, which we found to be the Manicomio, the insane asylum. Shortly\r\nbefore the dream I had heard that a co-religionist had been forced to\r\nresign a position at a state asylum which he had secured with great\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nOur interest is aroused by the speech: \xe2\x80\x9c_Auf Geseres_\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94where we might\r\nexpect, from the situation maintained throughout the dream, \xe2\x80\x9c_Auf\r\nWiedersehen_\xe2\x80\x9d (_Au revoir_)\xe2\x80\x94and by its quite meaningless opposite, \xe2\x80\x9c_Auf\r\nUngeseres_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccording to information I have received from Hebrew scholars, _Geseres_\r\nis a genuine Hebrew word derived from the verb _goiser_, and may best be\r\nrendered by \xe2\x80\x9cordained sufferings, fated disaster.\xe2\x80\x9d From its use in the\r\nJewish jargon one might think it signified \xe2\x80\x9cwailing and lamentation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n_Ungeseres_ is a coinage of my own and first attracts my attention; but\r\nfor the present it baffles me. The little observation at the end of the\r\ndream, that _Ungeseres_ indicates an advantage over _Geseres_ opens the\r\nway to the associations and to an explanation. The same relation holds\r\ngood with caviare; the unsalted kind[EU] is more highly prized than the\r\nsalted. Caviare to the general, \xe2\x80\x9cnoble passions\xe2\x80\x9d; herein lies concealed\r\na joking allusion to a member of my household, of whom I hope\xe2\x80\x94for she is\r\nyounger than I\xe2\x80\x94that she will watch over the future of my children; this,\r\ntoo, agrees with the fact that another member of my household, our\r\nworthy nurse, is clearly indicated in the nurse (or nun) of the dream.\r\nBut a connecting link is wanting between the pair, _salted_ and\r\n_unsalted_, and _Geseres\xe2\x80\x94ungeseres_. This is to be found in _soured and\r\nunsoured_. In their flight or exodus out of Egypt, the children of\r\nIsrael did not have time to allow their bread to be leavened, and in\r\nmemory of the event to this day they eat unsoured bread at Easter time.\r\nHere I can also find room for the sudden notion which came to me in this\r\npart of the analysis. I remembered how we promenaded about the city of\r\nBreslau, which was strange to us, at the end of the Easter holidays, my\r\nfriend from Berlin and I. A little girl asked me to tell her the way to\r\na certain street; I had to tell her I did not know it, whereupon I\r\nremarked to my friend, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope that later on in life the little one will\r\nshow more perspicacity in selecting the persons by whom she allows\r\nherself to be guided.\xe2\x80\x9d Shortly afterwards a sign caught my eye: \xe2\x80\x9cDr.\r\n_Herod_, office hours....\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope this colleague does\r\nnot happen to be a children\xe2\x80\x99s specialist.\xe2\x80\x9d Meanwhile my friend had been\r\ndeveloping his views on the biological significance of _bilateral_\r\nsymmetry, and had begun a sentence as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cIf we had but one eye in\r\nthe middle of our foreheads like _Cyclops_....\xe2\x80\x9d This leads us to the\r\nspeech of the professor in the preliminary dream: \xe2\x80\x9cMy son, the\r\n_myopic_.\xe2\x80\x9d And now I have been led to the chief source for _Geseres_.\r\nMany years ago, when this son of Professor M., who is to-day an\r\nindependent thinker, was still sitting on his school-bench, he\r\ncontracted a disease of the eye, which the doctor declared gave cause\r\nfor anxiety. He was of the opinion that as long as it remained in one\r\neye it would not matter; if, however, it should extend to the other eye,\r\nit would be serious. The disease healed in the one eye without leaving\r\nany bad effects; shortly afterwards, however, its symptoms actually\r\nappeared in the other eye. The terrified mother of the boy immediately\r\nsummoned the physician to the seclusion of her country resort. But he\r\ntook _another view_ of the matter. \xe2\x80\x9c_What sort of \xe2\x80\x98Geseres\xe2\x80\x99 is this you\r\nare making?_\xe2\x80\x9d he said to his mother with impatience. \xe2\x80\x9cIf one side got\r\nwell, the other side will get well too.\xe2\x80\x9d And so it turned out.\r\n\r\nAnd now as to the connection between this and myself and those dear to\r\nme. The school-bench upon which the son of Professor M. learned his\r\nfirst lessons has become the property of my eldest son\xe2\x80\x94it was given to\r\nhis mother-into whose lips I put the words of parting in the dream. One\r\nof the wishes that can be attached to this transference may now easily\r\nbe guessed. This school-bench is intended by its construction to guard\r\nthe child from becoming shortsighted and one-sided. Hence, myopia (and\r\nbehind the Cyclops) and the discussion about _bilateralism_. The concern\r\nabout one-sidedness is of two-fold signification; along with the bodily\r\none-sidedness, that of intellectual development may be referred to. Does\r\nit not seem as though the scene in the dream, with all its madness, were\r\nputting its negative on just this anxiety? After the child has said his\r\nword of parting _on the one side_, he calls out its opposite on the\r\n_other side_, as though in order to establish an equilibrium. _He is\r\nacting, as it were, in obedience to bilateral symmetry!_\r\n\r\nThus the dream frequently has the profoundest meaning in places where it\r\nseems most absurd. In all ages those who had something to say and were\r\nunable to say it without danger to themselves gladly put on the cap and\r\nbells. The listener for whom the forbidden saying was intended was more\r\nlikely to tolerate it if he was able to laugh at it, and to flatter\r\nhimself with the comment that what he disliked was obviously something\r\nabsurd. The dream proceeds in reality just as the prince does in the\r\nplay who must counterfeit the fool, and hence the same thing may be said\r\nof the dream which Hamlet says of himself, substituting an\r\nunintelligible witticism for the real conditions: \xe2\x80\x9cI am but mad\r\nnorth-north-west; when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a\r\nhandsaw.\xe2\x80\x9d[EV]\r\n\r\nThus my solution of the problem of the absurdity of dreams is that the\r\ndream thoughts are never absurd\xe2\x80\x94at least not those belonging to the\r\ndreams of sane persons\xe2\x80\x94and that the dream activity produces absurd\r\ndreams and dreams with individual absurd elements if criticism,\r\nridicule, and derision in the dream thoughts are to be represented by it\r\nin its manner of expression. My next concern is to show that the dream\r\nactivity is primarily brought about by the co-operation of the three\r\nfactors which have been mentioned\xe2\x80\x94and of a fourth one which remains to\r\nbe cited\xe2\x80\x94that it accomplishes nothing short of a transposition of the\r\ndream thoughts, observing the three conditions which are prescribed for\r\nit, and that the question whether the mind operates in the dream with\r\nall its faculties, or only with a portion of them, is deprived of its\r\ncogency and is inapplicable to the actual circumstances. But since there\r\nare plenty of dreams in which judgments are passed, criticisms made, and\r\nfacts recognised, in which astonishment at some single element of the\r\ndream appears, and arguments and explanations are attempted, I must meet\r\nthe objections which may be inferred from these occurrences by the\r\ncitation of selected examples.\r\n\r\nMy answer is as follows: _Everything in the dream which occurs as an\r\napparent exercise of the critical faculty is to be regarded, not as an\r\nintellectual accomplishment of the dream activity, but as belonging to\r\nthe material of the dream thoughts, and it has found its way from them\r\nas a finished structure to the manifest dream content_. I may go even\r\nfurther than this. Even the judgments which are passed upon the dream as\r\nit is remembered after awakening and the feelings which are aroused by\r\nthe reproduction of the dream, belong in good part to the latent dream\r\ncontent, and must be fitted into their place in the interpretation of\r\nthe dream.\r\n\r\nI. A striking example of this I have already given. A female patient\r\ndoes not wish to relate her dream because it is too vague. She has seen\r\na person in the dream, and does not know whether it is her husband or\r\nher father. Then follows a second dream fragment in which there occurs a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmanure-can,\xe2\x80\x9d which gives rise to the following reminiscence. As a young\r\nhousewife, she once jokingly declared in the presence of a young\r\nrelative who frequented the house that her next care would be to procure\r\na new manure-can. The next morning one was sent to her, but it was\r\nfilled with lilies of the valley. This part of the dream served to\r\nrepresent the saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNot grown on your own manure.\xe2\x80\x9d[EW] When we\r\ncomplete the analysis we find that in the dream thoughts it is a matter\r\nof the after-effects of a story heard in youth, to the effect that a\r\ngirl had given birth to a child _concerning whom it was not clear who\r\nwas the real father_. The dream representation here goes over into the\r\nwaking thought, and allows one element of the dream thoughts to be\r\nrepresented by a judgment expressed in the waking state upon the whole\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nII. A similar case: One of my patients has a dream which seems\r\ninteresting to him, for he says to himself immediately after awakening:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I must tell that to the doctor_.\xe2\x80\x9d The dream is analysed, and shows the\r\nmost distinct allusion to an affair in which he had become involved\r\nduring the treatment, and of which he had decided \xe2\x80\x9c_to tell me\r\nnothing_.\xe2\x80\x9d[EX]\r\n\r\nIII. Here is a third example from my own experience:\r\n\r\n_I go to the hospital with P. through a region in which houses and\r\ngardens occur. With this comes the idea that I have already seen this\r\nregion in dreams several times. I do not know my way very well; P. shows\r\nme a way which leads through a corner to a restaurant (a room, not a\r\ngarden); here I ask for Mrs. Doni, and I hear that she is living in the\r\nbackground in a little room with three children. I go there, and while\r\non the way I meet an indistinct person with my two little girls, whom I\r\ntake with me after I have stood with them for a while. A kind of\r\nreproach against my wife for having left them there._\r\n\r\nUpon awakening I feel great _satisfaction_, the cause for this being the\r\nfact that I am now going to learn from the analysis what is meant by the\r\nidea \xe2\x80\x9c_I have already dreamed of that_.\xe2\x80\x9d[EY] But the analysis of the\r\ndream teaches me nothing on the subject; it only shows me that the\r\nsatisfaction belongs to the latent dream content, and not to my judgment\r\nupon the dream. It is _satisfaction over the fact that I have had\r\nchildren by my marriage_. P. is a person in whose company I walked the\r\npath of life for a certain space, but who has since far outdistanced me\r\nsocially and materially\xe2\x80\x94whose marriage, however, has remained childless.\r\nThe two occasions for the dream furnishing the proof of this may be\r\nfound by means of complete analysis. On the previous day I had read in\r\nthe paper the obituary notice of a certain Mrs. Dona A\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94y (out of which\r\nI make Doni), who had died in childbirth; I was told by my wife that the\r\ndead woman had been nursed by the same midwife she herself had had at\r\nthe birth of our two youngest boys. The name Dona had caught my\r\nattention, for I had recently found it for the first time in an English\r\nnovel. The other occasion for the dream may be found in the date on\r\nwhich it was dreamed; it was on the night before the birthday of my\r\neldest boy, who, it seems, is poetically gifted.\r\n\r\nIV. The same satisfaction remained with me after awakening from the\r\nabsurd dream that my father, after his death, had played a political\r\npart among the Magyars, and it is motivated by a continuance of the\r\nfeeling which accompanied the last sentence of the dream: \xe2\x80\x9c_I remember\r\nthat on his death-bed he looked so much like Garibaldi, and I am glad\r\nthat it has really come true. (Here belongs a forgotten continuation.)_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI can now supply from the analysis what belongs in this gap of the\r\ndream. It is the mention of my second boy, to whom I have given the\r\nfirst name of a great historical personage, who attracted me powerfully\r\nduring my boyhood, especially during my stay in England. I had to wait\r\nfor a year after making up my mind to use this name in case the expected\r\nchild should be a son, and I greeted him with it _in high satisfaction_\r\nas soon as he was born. It is easy to see how the father\xe2\x80\x99s lust for\r\ngreatness is transferred in his thoughts to his children; it will\r\nreadily be believed that this is one of the ways in which the\r\nsuppression of this lust which becomes necessary in life is brought\r\nabout. The little fellow won a place in the text of this dream by virtue\r\nof the fact that the same accident\xe2\x80\x94quite pardonable in a child or a\r\ndying person\xe2\x80\x94of soiling his clothes had happened to him. With this may\r\nbe compared the allusion \xe2\x80\x9c_Stuhlrichter_\xe2\x80\x9d (judge on the stool-bench,\r\n_i.e._ presiding judge) and the wish of the dream: To stand before one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchildren great and pure.\r\n\r\nV. I am now called upon to find expressions of judgment which remain in\r\nthe dream itself, and are not retained in or transferred to our waking\r\nthoughts, and I shall consider it a great relief if I may find examples\r\nin dreams, which have already been cited for other purposes. The dream\r\nabout Goethe\xe2\x80\x99s attacking Mr. M. seems to contain a considerable number\r\nof acts of judgment. _I try to find some explanation of the\r\nchronological relations, which seem improbable to me._ Does not this\r\nlook like a critical impulse directed against the nonsensical idea that\r\nGoethe should have made a literary attack upon a young man of my\r\nacquaintance? \xe2\x80\x9c_It seems plausible to me_ that he was 18 years old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThat sounds quite like the result of a dull-witted calculation; and \xe2\x80\x9c_I\r\ndo not know exactly what year it is_\xe2\x80\x9d would be an example of uncertainty\r\nor doubt in the dream.\r\n\r\nBut I know from analysis that these acts of judgment, which seem to have\r\nbeen performed in the dream for the first time, admit of a different\r\nconstruction in the light of which they become indispensable for\r\ninterpreting the dream, and at the same time every absurdity is avoided.\r\nWith the sentence, \xe2\x80\x9c_I try to find some explanation of the chronological\r\nrelations_,\xe2\x80\x9d I put myself in the place of my friend who is actually\r\ntrying to explain the chronological relations of life. The sentence then\r\nloses its significance as a judgment that objects to the nonsense of the\r\nprevious sentences. The interposition, \xe2\x80\x9c_which seems improbable to me_,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbelongs to the subsequent \xe2\x80\x9c_it seems plausible to me_.\xe2\x80\x9d In about the\r\nsame words I had answered the lady who told me the story of her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s illness: \xe2\x80\x9c_It seems improbable to me_ that the cry of \xe2\x80\x98Nature,\r\nNature,\xe2\x80\x99 had anything to do with Goethe; _it appears much more\r\nplausible_ that it had the sexual significance which is known to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nTo be sure, a judgment has been passed here, not, however, in the dream\r\nbut in reality, on an occasion which is remembered and utilised by the\r\ndream thoughts. The dream content appropriates this judgment like any\r\nother fragment of the dream thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe numeral 18, with which the judgment in the dream is meaninglessly\r\nconnected, still preserves a trace of the context from which the real\r\njudgment was torn. Finally, \xe2\x80\x9c_I am not certain what year it is_\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\nintended for nothing else than to carry out my identification with the\r\nparalytic, in the examination of whom this point of confirmation had\r\nactually been established.\r\n\r\nIn the solution of these apparent acts of judgment, in the dream, it may\r\nbe well to call attention to the rule of interpretation which says that\r\nthe coherence which is fabricated in the dream between its constituent\r\nparts is to be disregarded as specious and unessential, and that every\r\ndream element must be taken by itself and traced to its source. The\r\ndream is a conglomeration, which is to be broken up into its elements\r\nfor the purposes of investigation. But other circumstances call our\r\nattention to the fact that a psychic force is expressed in dreams which\r\nestablishes this apparent coherence\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, which subjects the\r\nmaterial that is obtained by the dream activity to a _secondary\r\nelaboration_. We are here confronted with manifestations of this force,\r\nupon which we shall later fix our attention as being the fourth of the\r\nfactors which take part in the formation of the dream.\r\n\r\nVI. I select other examples of critical activity in the dreams which\r\nhave already been cited. In the absurd dream about the communication\r\nfrom the common council I ask the question: \xe2\x80\x9c_You married shortly after?\r\nI figure that I was born in 1856, which appears to me as though\r\nfollowing immediately_.\xe2\x80\x9d This quite takes the form of an _inference_. My\r\nfather married shortly after his attack in the year 1851; I am the\r\noldest son, born in 1856; this agrees perfectly. We know that this\r\ninference has been interpolated by the wish-fulfilment, and that the\r\nsentence which dominates the dream thoughts is to the following effect:\r\n_4 or 5 years, that is no time at all, that need not enter the\r\ncalculation_. But every part of this chain of inferences is to be\r\ndetermined from the dream thoughts in a different manner, both as to its\r\ncontent and as to its form. It is the patient\xe2\x80\x94about whose endurance my\r\ncolleague complains\xe2\x80\x94who intends to marry immediately after the close of\r\nthe treatment. The manner in which I deal with my father in the dream\r\nrecalls an _inquest_ or _examination_, and with that the person of a\r\nuniversity instructor who was in the habit of taking a complete list of\r\ncredentials at the enrolment of his class: \xe2\x80\x9cYou were born when?\xe2\x80\x9d In\r\n1856. \xe2\x80\x9cPatre?\xe2\x80\x9d Then the applicant gave the first name of his father with\r\na Latin ending, and we students assumed that the Aulic Councillor drew\r\n_inferences_ from the first name of the father which the name of the\r\nenrolled student would not always have supplied. According to this, the\r\n_drawing of inferences_ in the dream would be merely a repetition of the\r\n_drawing of inferences_ which appears as part of the subject-matter in\r\nthe dream thoughts. From this we learn something new. If an inference\r\noccurs in the dream content, it invariably comes from the dream\r\nthoughts; it may be contained in these as a bit of remembered material,\r\nor it may serve as a logical connective in a series of dream thoughts.\r\nIn any case an inference in the dream represents an inference in the\r\ndream thoughts.[EZ]\r\n\r\nThe analysis of this dream should be continued here. With the inquest of\r\nthe Professor there is connected the recollection of an index (published\r\nin Latin during my time) of the university students; also of my course\r\nof studies. The _five years_ provided for the study of medicine were as\r\nusual not enough for me. I worked along unconcernedly in the succeeding\r\nyears; in the circle of my acquaintances I was considered a loafer, and\r\nthere was doubt as to whether I would \xe2\x80\x9cget through.\xe2\x80\x9d Then all at once I\r\ndecided to take my examinations; and I got \xe2\x80\x9cthrough,\xe2\x80\x9d _in spite of the\r\npostponement_. This is a new confirmation of the dream thoughts, which I\r\ndefiantly hold up to my critics: \xe2\x80\x9cEven though you are unwilling to\r\nbelieve it, because I take my time, I shall reach a conclusion (German\r\n_Schluss_, meaning either end or conclusion, _inference_). It has often\r\nhappened that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn its introductory portion this dream contains several sentences which\r\ncannot well be denied the character of an argumentation. And this\r\nargumentation is not at all absurd; it might just as well belong to\r\nwaking thought. _In the dream I make sport of the communication of the\r\nCommon Council, for in the first place I was not yet in the world in\r\n1851, and in the second place, my father, to whom it might refer, is\r\nalready dead._ Both are not only correct in themselves, but coincide\r\ncompletely with the arguments that I should use in case I should receive\r\na communication of the sort mentioned. We know from our previous\r\nanalysis that this dream has sprung from deeply embittered and scornful\r\ndream thoughts; if we may assume further that the motive for censorship\r\nis a very strong one, we shall understand that the dream activity has\r\nevery reason to create _a flawless refutation of a baseless insinuation_\r\naccording to the model contained in the dream thoughts. But analysis\r\nshows that in this case the dream activity has not had the task of\r\nmaking a free copy, but it has been required to use subject-matter from\r\nthe dream thoughts for its purpose. It is as if in an algebraic equation\r\nthere occurred plus and minus signs, signs of powers and of roots,\r\nbesides the figures, and as if someone, in copying this equation without\r\nunderstanding it, should take over into his copy the signs of operation\r\nas well as the figures, and fail to distinguish between the two kinds.\r\nThe two arguments may be traced to the following material. It is painful\r\nfor me to think that many of the assumptions upon which I base my\r\nsolution of psychoneuroses, as soon as they have become known, will\r\narouse scepticism and ridicule. Thus I must maintain that impressions\r\nfrom the second year of life, or even from the first, leave a lasting\r\ntrace upon the temperament of persons who later become diseased, and\r\nthat these impressions\xe2\x80\x94greatly distorted it is true, and exaggerated by\r\nmemory\xe2\x80\x94are capable of furnishing the original and fundamental basis of\r\nhysterical symptoms. Patients to whom I explain this in its proper place\r\nare in the habit of making a parody upon the explanation by declaring\r\nthemselves willing to look for reminiscences of the period _when they\r\nwere not yet alive_. It would quite accord with my expectation, if\r\nenlightenment on the subject of the unsuspected part played by the\r\nfather in the earliest sexual impulses of feminine patients should get a\r\nsimilar reception. (_Cf._ the discussion on p. 218.) And, nevertheless,\r\nboth positions are correct according to my well-founded conviction. In\r\nconfirmation I recall certain examples in which the death of the father\r\nhappened when the child was very young, and later events, otherwise\r\ninexplicable, proved that the child had unconsciously preserved\r\nrecollections of the persons who had so early gone out of its life. I\r\nknow that both of my assertions are based upon _inferences_ the validity\r\nof which will be attacked. If the subject-matter of these very\r\ninferences which I fear will be contested is used by the dream activity\r\nfor setting up _incontestable inferences_, this is a performance of the\r\nwish-fulfilment.\r\n\r\nVII. In a dream which I have hitherto only touched upon, astonishment at\r\nthe subject to be broached is distinctly expressed at the outset.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_The elder Bruecke must have given me some task or other; strangely\r\nenough it relates to the preparation of my own lower body, pelvis and\r\nlegs, which I see before me as though in the dissecting room, but\r\nwithout feeling my lack of body and without a trace of horror. Louise N.\r\nis standing near, and doing her work next to me. The pelvis is\r\neviscerated; now the upper, now the lower view of the same is seen, and\r\nthe two views mingle. Thick fleshy red lumps (which even in the dream\r\nmake me think of h\xc3\xa6morrhoids) are to be seen. Also something had to be\r\ncarefully picked out, which lay over these and which looked like\r\ncrumpled tinfoil.[FA] Then I was again in possession of my legs and made\r\na journey through the city, but took a wagon (owing to my fatigue). To\r\nmy astonishment the wagon drove into a house door, which opened and\r\nallowed it to pass into a passage that was snapped off at the end, and\r\nfinally led further on into the open.[FB] At last I wandered through\r\nchanging landscapes with an Alpine guide, who carried my things. He\r\ncarried, me for some way, out of consideration for my tired legs. The\r\nground was muddy, and we went along the edge; people sat on the ground,\r\na girl among them, like Indians or Gypsies. Previously I had moved\r\nmyself along on the slippery ground, with constant astonishment that I\r\nwas so well able to do it after the preparation. At last we came to a\r\nsmall wooden house which ended in an open window. Here the guide set me\r\ndown, and laid two wooden boards which stood in readiness on the window\r\nsill, in order that in this way the chasm might be bridged which had to\r\nbe crossed in order to get to the window. Now, I grew really frightened\r\nabout my legs. Instead of the expected crossing, I saw two grown-up men\r\nlying upon wooden benches which were on the walls of the hut, and\r\nsomething like two sleeping children next to them. It seems as though\r\nnot the boards but the children were intended to make possible the\r\ncrossing. I awakened with frightened thoughts._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnyone who has formed a proper idea of the abundance of dream\r\ncondensation will easily be able to imagine how great a number of pages\r\nthe detailed analysis of this dream must fill. Luckily for the context,\r\nI shall take from it merely the one example of astonishment, in the\r\ndream, which makes its appearance in the parenthetical remark,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_strangely enough_.\xe2\x80\x9d Let us take up the occasion of the dream. It is a\r\nvisit of this lady, Louise N., who assists at the work in the dream. She\r\nsays: \xe2\x80\x9cLend me something to read.\xe2\x80\x9d I offer her _She_, by Rider Haggard.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA _strange_ book, but full of hidden sense,\xe2\x80\x9d I try to explain to her;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe eternal feminine, the immortality of our emotions\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d Here she\r\ninterrupts me: \xe2\x80\x9cI know that book already. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you something of your\r\nown?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo, my own immortal works are still unwritten.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWell, when are\r\nyou going to publish your so-called latest revelations which you\r\npromised us would be good reading?\xe2\x80\x9d she asks somewhat sarcastically. I\r\nnow perceive that she is a mouthpiece for someone else, and I become\r\nsilent. I think of the effort it costs me to publish even my work on the\r\nDream, in which I have to surrender so much of my own intimate\r\ncharacter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe best that you know you can\xe2\x80\x99t tell to the children.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\npreparation of _my own body_, which I am ordered to make in the dream,\r\nis thus the _self-analysis_ necessitated in the communication of my\r\ndreams. The elder Bruecke very properly finds a place here; in these\r\nfirst years of my scientific work it happened that I neglected a\r\ndiscovery, until his energetic commands forced me to publish it. But the\r\nother trains of thought which start from my conversation with Louise N.\r\ngo too deep to become conscious; they are side-tracked by way of the\r\nrelated material which has been awakened in me by the mention of Rider\r\nHaggard\xe2\x80\x99s _She_. The comment \xe2\x80\x9cstrangely enough\xe2\x80\x9d goes with this book, and\r\nwith another by the same author, _The Heart of the World_, and numerous\r\nelements of the dream are taken from these two fantastic novels. The\r\nmuddy ground over which the dreamer is carried, the chasm which must be\r\ncrossed by means of the boards that have been brought along, come from\r\n_She_; the Indians, the girl, and the wooden house, from the _Heart of\r\nthe World_. In both novels a woman is the leader, both treat of\r\ndangerous wanderings; _She_ has to do with an adventurous journey to the\r\nundiscovered country, a place almost untrodden by foot of man. According\r\nto a note which I find in my record of the dream, the fatigue in my legs\r\nwas a real sensation of those days. Doubtless in correspondence with\r\nthis came a tired frame of mind and the doubting question: \xe2\x80\x9cHow much\r\nfurther will my legs carry me?\xe2\x80\x9d The adventure in _She_ ends with the\r\nwoman leader\xe2\x80\x99s meeting her death in the mysterious fire at the centre of\r\nthe earth, instead of attaining immortality for herself and others. A\r\nfear of this sort has unmistakably arisen in the dream thoughts. The\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwooden house,\xe2\x80\x9d also, is surely the coffin\xe2\x80\x94that is, the grave. But the\r\ndream activity has performed its masterpiece in representing this most\r\nunwished-for of all thoughts by means of a wish-fulfilment. I have\r\nalready once been in a grave, but it was an empty Etruscan grave near\r\nOrvieto\xe2\x80\x94a narrow chamber with two stone benches on the walls, upon which\r\nthe skeletons of two grown-up persons had been laid. The interior of the\r\nwooden house in the dream looks exactly like this, except that wood has\r\nbeen substituted for stone. The dream seems to say: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you must so soon\r\nlie in your grave, let it be this Etruscan grave,\xe2\x80\x9d and by means of this\r\ninterpolation it transforms the saddest expectation into one that is\r\nreally to be desired. As we shall learn, it is, unfortunately, only the\r\nidea accompanying an emotion which the dream can change into its\r\nopposite, not usually the emotion itself. Thus I awake with \xe2\x80\x9cfrightened\r\nthoughts,\xe2\x80\x9d even after the dream has been forced to represent my\r\nidea\xe2\x80\x94that perhaps the children will attain what has been denied to the\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x94a fresh allusion to the strange novel in which the identity of a\r\nperson is preserved through a series of generations covering two\r\nthousand years.\r\n\r\nVIII. In the context of another dream there is a similar expression of\r\nastonishment at what is experienced in the dream. This, however, is\r\nconnected with a striking and skilfully contrived attempt at explanation\r\nwhich might well be called a stroke of genius\xe2\x80\x94so that I should have to\r\nanalyse the whole dream merely for the sake of it, even if the dream did\r\nnot possess two other features of interest. I am travelling during the\r\nnight between the eighteenth and the nineteenth of July on the Southern\r\nRailway, and in my sleep I hear someone call out: _\xe2\x80\x9cHollthurn, 10\r\nminutes.\xe2\x80\x9d I immediately think of Holothurian\xe2\x80\x94of a museum of natural\r\nhistory\xe2\x80\x94that here is a place where brave men have vainly resisted the\r\ndomination of their overlord. Yes, the counter reformation in Austria!\r\nAs though it were a place in Styria or the Tyrol. Now I distinctly see a\r\nlittle museum in which the remains or the possessions of these men are\r\npreserved. I wish to get off, but I hesitate to do so. Women with fruit\r\nare standing on the platform; they crouch on the floor, and in that\r\nposition hold out their baskets in an inviting manner. I hesitate, in\r\ndoubt whether we still have time, but we are still standing. I am\r\nsuddenly in another compartment in which the leather and the seats are\r\nso narrow that one\xe2\x80\x99s back directly touches the back rest.[FC] I am\r\nsurprised at this, but I may have changed cars while asleep. Several\r\npeople, among them an English brother and sister; a row of books\r\ndistinctly on a shelf on the wall. I see_ The Wealth of Nations, _then_\r\nMatter and Motion (_by Maxwell_)\xe2\x80\x94_the books are thick and bound in brown\r\nlinen. The man asks his sister for a book by Schiller, and whether she\r\nhas forgotten it. These are books which first seem mine, then seem to\r\nbelong to the brother and sister. At this point I wish to join in the\r\nconversation in order to confirm and support what is being said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94._ I\r\nawaken sweating all over my body, because all the windows are shut. The\r\ntrain stops at Marburg.\r\n\r\nWhile writing down the dream, a part of it occurs to me which my memory\r\nwished to omit. _I say to the brother and sister about a certain work:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is from ...\xe2\x80\x9d but I correct myself: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is by ...\xe2\x80\x9d The man remarks to\r\nhis sister: \xe2\x80\x9cHe said it correctly.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nThe dream begins with the name of a station, which probably must have\r\npartially awakened me. For this name, which was Marburg, I substituted\r\nHollthurn. The fact that I heard Marburg when it was first called, or\r\nperhaps when it was called a second time, is proved by the mention in\r\nthe dream of Schiller, who was born in Marburg, though not in the one in\r\nStyria.[FD] Now this time, although I was travelling first-class, it was\r\nunder very disagreeable circumstances. The train was overcrowded; I had\r\nmet a gentleman and lady in my compartment who seemed persons of\r\nquality, but who did not have the good breeding or who did not think it\r\nworth while to conceal their displeasure at my intrusion. My polite\r\nsalutation was not answered, and although the man and the woman sat next\r\neach other (with their backs in the direction in which we were riding),\r\nthe woman made haste to pre-empt the place opposite her and next the\r\nwindow with her umbrella; the door was immediately closed and\r\ndemonstrative remarks about the opening of windows were exchanged.\r\nProbably I was quickly recognised as a person hungry for fresh air. It\r\nwas a hot night, and the air in the compartment, thus shut on all sides,\r\nwas almost suffocating. My experience as a traveller leads me to believe\r\nthat such inconsiderate, obtrusive conduct marks people who have only\r\npartly paid for their tickets, or not at all. When the conductor came,\r\nand I presented my dearly bought ticket, the lady called out\r\nungraciously, and as though threateningly: \xe2\x80\x9cMy husband has a pass.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nwas a stately figure with sour features, in age not far from the time\r\nset for the decay of feminine beauty; the man did not get a chance to\r\nsay anything at all, and sat there motionless. I tried to sleep. In the\r\ndream I take terrible revenge on my disagreeable travelling companions;\r\nno one would suspect what insults and humiliations are concealed behind\r\nthe disjointed fragments of the first half of the dream. After this\r\ndesire has been satisfied, the second wish, to exchange my compartment\r\nfor another, makes itself evident. The dream makes changes of scene so\r\noften, and without raising the least objection to such changes, that it\r\nwould not have been in the least remarkable if I had immediately\r\nreplaced my travelling companions by more pleasant ones for my\r\nrecollection. But this was one of the cases where something or other\r\nobjected to the change of scene and considered explanation of the change\r\nnecessary. How did I suddenly get into another compartment? I surely\r\ncould not remember having changed cars. So there was only one\r\nexplanation: _I must have left the carriage while asleep_, a rare\r\noccurrence, examples for which, however, are furnished by the experience\r\nof the neuropathologist. We know of persons who undertake railroad\r\njourneys in a crepuscular state without betraying their abnormal\r\ncondition by any sign, until some station on the journey they completely\r\nrecover consciousness, and are then surprised at the gap in their\r\nmemory. Thus, while I am still dreaming, I declare my own case to be\r\nsuch a one of \xe2\x80\x9c_Automatisme ambulatoire_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnalysis permits another solution. The attempt at explanation, which so\r\nastounds me if I am to attribute it to the dream activity, is not\r\noriginal, but is copied from the neurosis of one of my patients. I have\r\nalready spoken on another page of a highly cultured and, in conduct,\r\nkind-hearted man, who began, shortly after the death of his parents, to\r\naccuse himself of murderous inclinations, and who suffered because of\r\nthe precautionary measures he had to take to insure himself against\r\nthese inclinations. At first walking along the street was made painful\r\nfor him by the compulsion impelling him to demand an accounting of all\r\nthe persons he met as to whither they had vanished; if one of them\r\nsuddenly withdrew from his pursuing glance, there remained a painful\r\nfeeling and a thought of the possibility that he might have put the man\r\nout of the way. This compulsive idea concealed, among other things, a\r\nCain-fancy, for \xe2\x80\x9call men are brothers.\xe2\x80\x9d Owing to the impossibility of\r\naccomplishing his task, he gave up taking walks and spent his life\r\nimprisoned within his four walls. But news of murderous acts which have\r\nbeen committed outside constantly reached his room through the papers,\r\nand his conscience in the form of a doubt kept accusing him of being the\r\nmurderer. The certainty of not having left his dwelling for weeks\r\nprotected him against these accusations for a time, until one day there\r\ndawned upon him the possibility that he might have left _his house while\r\nin an unconscious condition_, and might thus have committed the murder\r\nwithout knowing anything about it. From that time on he locked his house\r\ndoor, and handed the key over to his old housekeeper, and strictly\r\nforbade her to give it into his hands even if he demanded it.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the origin of the attempted explanation, that I may have\r\nchanged carriages while in an unconscious condition\xe2\x80\x94it has been\r\ntransferred from the material of the dream thoughts to the dream in a\r\nfinished state, and is obviously intended to identify me with the person\r\nof that patient. My memory of him was awakened by an easy association. I\r\nhad made my last night journey with this man a few weeks before. He was\r\ncured, and was escorting me into the country, to his relatives who were\r\nsummoning me; as we had a compartment to ourselves, we left all the\r\nwindows open through the night, and, as long as I had remained awake, we\r\nhad a delightful conversation. I knew that hostile impulses towards his\r\nfather from the time of his childhood, in connection with sexual\r\nmaterial, had been at the root of his illness. By identifying myself\r\nwith him, I wanted to make an analogous confession to myself. The second\r\nscene of the dream really resolves itself into a wanton fancy to the\r\neffect that my two elderly travelling companions had acted so uncivilly\r\ntowards me for the reason that my arrival prevented them from exchanging\r\nlove-tokens during the night as they had intended. This fancy, however,\r\ngoes back to an early childhood scene in which, probably impelled by\r\nsexual inquisitiveness, I intruded upon the bedroom of my parents, and\r\nwas driven from it by my father\xe2\x80\x99s emphatic command.\r\n\r\nI consider it superfluous to multiply further examples. All of them\r\nwould confirm what we have learned from those which have been already\r\ncited, namely, that an act of judgment in the dream is nothing but the\r\nrepetition of a prototype which it has in the dream thoughts. In most\r\ncases it is an inappropriate repetition introduced in an unfitting\r\nconnection; occasionally, however, as in our last example, it is so\r\nartfully disposed that it may give the impression of being an\r\nindependent thought activity in the dream. At this point we might turn\r\nour attention to that psychic activity which indeed does not seem to\r\nco-operate regularly in the formation of dreams, but whose effort it is,\r\nwherever it does co-operate, to fuse together those dream elements that\r\nare incongruent on account of their origins in an uncontradictory and\r\nintelligible manner. We consider it best, however, first to take up the\r\nexpressions of emotion which appear in the dream, and to compare them\r\nwith the emotions which analysis reveals to us in the dream thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   (_g_) _The Affects in the Dream._\r\n\r\nA profound remark of Stricker\xe2\x80\x99s[77] has called our attention to the fact\r\nthat the expressions of emotion in the dream do not permit of being\r\ndisposed of in the slighting manner in which we are accustomed to shake\r\noff the dream itself, after we have awakened. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I am afraid of robbers\r\nin the dream, the robbers, to be sure, are imaginary, but the fear of\r\nthem is real,\xe2\x80\x9d and the same is true if I am glad in the dream. According\r\nto the testimony of our feelings, the emotion experienced in the dream\r\nis in no way less valid than one of like intensity experienced in waking\r\nlife, and the dream makes its claim to be taken up as a part of our real\r\nmental experiences, more energetically on account of its emotional\r\ncontent than on account of its ideal content. We do not succeed in\r\naccomplishing this separation in waking life, because we do not know how\r\nto estimate an emotion psychically except in connection with a\r\npresentation content. If in kind or in intensity an affect and an idea\r\nare incongruous, our waking judgment becomes confused.\r\n\r\nThe fact that in dreams the presentation content does not entail the\r\naffective influence which we should expect as necessary in waking\r\nthought has always caused astonishment. Str\xc3\xbcmpell was of the opinion\r\nthat ideas in the dream are stripped of their psychic values. But\r\nneither does the dream lack opposite instances, where the expression of\r\nintense affect appears in a content, which seems to offer no occasion\r\nfor its development. I am in a horrible, dangerous, or disgusting\r\nsituation in the dream, but I feel nothing of fear or aversion; on the\r\nother hand, I am sometimes terrified at harmless things and glad at\r\nchildish ones.\r\n\r\nThis enigma of the dream disappears more suddenly and more completely\r\nthan perhaps any other of the dream problems, if we pass from the\r\nmanifest to the latent content. We shall then no longer be concerned to\r\nexplain it, for it will no longer exist. Analysis teaches us _that\r\npresentation contents have undergone displacements and substitutions,\r\nwhile affects have remained unchanged_. No wonder, then, that the\r\npresentation content which has been altered by dream disfigurement no\r\nlonger fits the affect that has remained intact; but there is no cause\r\nfor wonder either after analysis has put the correct content in its\r\nformer place.\r\n\r\nIn a psychic complex which has been subjected to the influence of the\r\nresisting censor the affects are the unyielding constituent, which alone\r\nis capable of guiding us to a correct supplementation. This state of\r\naffairs is revealed in psychoneuroses even more distinctly than in the\r\ndream. Here the affect is always in the right, at least as far as its\r\nquality goes; its intensity may even be increased by means of a\r\ndisplacement of neurotic attention. If a hysteric is surprised that he\r\nis so very afraid of a trifle, or if the patient with compulsive ideas\r\nis astonished that he develops such painful self-reproach out of a\r\nnonentity, both of them err in that they regard the presentation\r\ncontent\xe2\x80\x94the trifle or the nonentity\xe2\x80\x94as the essential thing, and they\r\ndefend themselves in vain because they make this presentation content\r\nthe starting point in their thought. Psychoanalysis, however, shows them\r\nthe right way by recognising that, on the contrary, the affect is\r\njustified, and by searching for the presentation which belongs to it and\r\nwhich has been suppressed by means of replacement. The assumption is\r\nhere made that the development of affect and the presentation content do\r\nnot constitute such an indissoluble organic union as we are accustomed\r\nto think, but that the two parts may be, so to speak, soldered together\r\nin such a way that they may be detached from one another by means of\r\nanalysis. Dream interpretation shows that this is actually the case.\r\n\r\nI give first an example in which analysis explains the apparent absence\r\nof affect in a presentation content which ought to force a development\r\nof emotion.\r\n\r\nI. _The dreamer sees three lions in a desert, one of which is laughing,\r\nbut she is not afraid of them. Then, however, she must have fled from\r\nthem, for she is trying to climb a tree, but she finds that her cousin,\r\nwho is a teacher of French, is already up in the tree, &c._\r\n\r\nThe analysis gives us the following material for this dream: A sentence\r\nin the dreamer\xe2\x80\x99s English lesson had become the indifferent occasion for\r\nit: \xe2\x80\x9cThe _lion\xe2\x80\x99s_ greatest beauty is his mane.\xe2\x80\x9d Her father wore a beard\r\nwhich surrounded his face like a mane. The name of her English teacher\r\nwas Miss _Lyons_. An acquaintance of hers had sent her the ballads of\r\n_Loewe_ (German, Loewe\xe2\x80\x94lion). These, then, are the three lions; why\r\nshould she have been afraid of them? She has read a story in which a\r\nnegro who has incited his fellows to revolt is hunted with bloodhounds\r\nand climbs a tree to save himself. Then follow fragments in wanton mood,\r\nlike the following. Directions for catching lions from _Die Fliegende\r\nBlaetter_: \xe2\x80\x9cTake a desert and strain it; the lions will remain.\xe2\x80\x9d Also a\r\nvery amusing, but not very proper anecdote about an official who is\r\nasked why he does not take greater pains to win the favour of his\r\nsuperior officer, and who answers that he has been trying to insinuate\r\nhimself, but that the man ahead of him _is already up_. The whole matter\r\nbecomes intelligible as soon as one learns that on the day of the dream\r\nthe lady had received a visit from her husband\xe2\x80\x99s superior. He was very\r\npolite to her, kissed her hand, and _she was not afraid of him at all_,\r\nalthough he is a \xe2\x80\x9cbig bug\xe2\x80\x9d (German\xe2\x80\x94_Grosses Tier_ = \xe2\x80\x9cbig animal\xe2\x80\x9d) and\r\nplays the part of a \xe2\x80\x9csocial lion\xe2\x80\x9d in the capital of her country. This\r\nlion is, therefore, like the lion in the _Midsummer Night\xe2\x80\x99s Dream_, who\r\nunmasks as Snug, the joiner, and of such stuff are all dream lions made\r\nwhen one is not afraid.\r\n\r\nII. As my second example, I cite the dream of the girl who saw her\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s little son lying dead in a coffin, but who, I may now add, felt\r\nno pain or sorrow thereat. We know from analysis why not. The dream only\r\nconcealed her wish to see the man she loved again; the affect must be\r\nattuned to the wish, and not to its concealment. There was no occasion\r\nfor sorrow at all.\r\n\r\nIn a number of dreams the emotion at least remains connected with that\r\npresentation content which has replaced the one really belonging to it.\r\nIn others the breaking up of the complex is carried further. The affect\r\nseems to be entirely separated from the idea belonging to it, and finds\r\na place somewhere else in the dream where it fits into the new\r\narrangement of the dream elements. This is similar to what we have\r\nlearned of acts of judgment of the dream. If there is a significant\r\ninference in the dream thoughts, the dream also contains one; but in the\r\ndream the inference may be shifted to entirely different material. Not\r\ninfrequently this shifting takes place according to the principle of\r\nantithesis.\r\n\r\nI illustrate the latter possibility by the following dream, which I have\r\nsubjected to the most exhaustive analysis.\r\n\r\nIII. _A castle by the sea; afterwards it lies not directly on the sea,\r\nbut on a narrow canal that leads to the sea. A certain Mr. P. is the\r\ngovernor of it. I stand with him in a large salon with three windows, in\r\nfront of which rise the projections of a wall, like battlements of a\r\nfort. I belong to the garrison, perhaps as a volunteer marine officer.\r\nWe fear the arrival of hostile warships, for we are in a state of war.\r\nMr. P. has the intention of leaving; he gives me instructions as to what\r\nmust be done in case the dreaded event happens. His sick wife is in the\r\nthreatened castle with her children. As soon as the bombardment begins\r\nthe large hall should be cleared. He breathes heavily, and tries to get\r\naway; I hold him back, and ask him in what way I should send him news in\r\ncase of need. He says something else, and then all at once falls over\r\ndead. I have probably taxed him unnecessarily with my questions. After\r\nhis death, which makes no further impression upon me, I think whether\r\nthe widow is to remain in the castle, whether I should give notice of\r\nthe death to the commander-in-chief, and whether I should take over the\r\ndirection of the castle as the next in command. I now stand at the\r\nwindow, and muster the ships as they pass by; they are merchantmen that\r\ndart past upon the dark water, several of them with more than one\r\nsmokestack, others with bulging decks_ (that are quite similar to the\r\nrailway stations in the preliminary dream which has not been told).\r\n_Then my brother stands next to me, and both of us look out of the\r\nwindow on to the canal. At the sight of a ship we are frightened, and\r\ncall out: \xe2\x80\x9cHere comes the warship!\xe2\x80\x9d It turns out, however, that it is\r\nonly the same ships which I have already known that are returning. Now\r\ncomes a little ship, strangely cut off, so that it ends in the middle of\r\nits breadth; curious things like cups or salt-cellars are seen on the\r\ndeck. We call as though with one voice: \xe2\x80\x9cThat is the breakfast-ship.\xe2\x80\x9d_\r\n\r\nThe rapid motion of the ships, the deep blue of the water, the brown\r\nsmoke of the funnels, all this together makes a highly tense, sombre\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nThe localities in this dream are put together from several journeys to\r\nthe Adriatic Sea (Miramare, Duino, Venice, Aquileja). A short but\r\nenjoyable Easter trip to Aquileja with my brother, a few weeks before\r\nthe dream, was still fresh in my memory. Besides, the naval war between\r\nAmerica and Spain, and the worry connected with it about my relatives\r\nliving in America, play a part. Manifestations of emotion appear at two\r\nplaces in this dream. In one place an emotion that would be expected is\r\nlacking\xe2\x80\x94it is expressly emphasized that the death of the governor makes\r\nno impression upon me; at another point, where I see the warships I am\r\n_frightened_, and experience all the sensations of fright while I sleep.\r\nThe distribution of affects in this well-constructed dream has been made\r\nin such a way that every obvious contradiction is avoided. For there is\r\nno reason why I should be frightened at the governor\xe2\x80\x99s death, and it is\r\nfitting that as the commander of the castle I should be alarmed by the\r\nsight of the warship. Now analysis shows that Mr. P. is nothing but a\r\nsubstitute for my own Ego (in the dream I am his substitute). I am the\r\ngovernor who suddenly dies. The dream thoughts deal with the future of\r\nthose dear to me after my premature death. No other disagreeable thought\r\nis to be found among the dream thoughts. The fright which is attached to\r\nthe sight of the warship must be transferred from it to this\r\ndisagreeable thought. Inversely, the analysis shows that the region of\r\nthe dream thoughts from which the warship comes is filled with most\r\njoyous reminiscences. It was at Venice a year before, one charmingly\r\nbeautiful day, that we stood at the windows of our room on the Riva\r\nSchiavoni and looked upon the blue lagoon, in which more activity could\r\nbe seen that day than usually. English ships were being expected, they\r\nwere to be festively received; and suddenly my wife called out, happy as\r\na child: \xe2\x80\x9c_There come the English warships!_\xe2\x80\x9d In the dream I am\r\nfrightened at the very same words; we see again that speeches in the\r\ndream originate from speeches in life. I shall soon show that even the\r\nelement \xe2\x80\x9cEnglish\xe2\x80\x9d in this speech has not been lost for the dream\r\nactivity. I thus convert joy into fright on the way from the dream\r\nthoughts to the dream content, and I need only intimate that by means of\r\nthis very transformation I give expression to a part of the latent dream\r\ncontent. The example shows, however, that the dream activity is at\r\nliberty to detach the occasion for an affect from its context in the\r\ndream thoughts, and to insert it at any other place it chooses in the\r\ndream content.\r\n\r\nI seize the opportunity which is incidentally offered, of subjecting to\r\ncloser analysis the \xe2\x80\x9cbreakfast ship,\xe2\x80\x9d whose appearance in the dream so\r\nnonsensically concludes a situation that has been rationally adhered to.\r\nIf I take a closer view of this object in the dream, I am now struck by\r\nthe fact that it was black, and that on account of its being cut off at\r\nits greatest breadth it closely resembled, at the end where it was cut\r\noff, an object which had aroused our interest in the museums of the\r\nEtruscan cities. This object was a rectangular cup of black clay with\r\ntwo handles, upon which stood things like coffee cups, or tea cups, very\r\nsimilar to our modern _breakfast_ table service. Upon inquiring, we\r\nlearned that this was the toilet set of an Etruscan lady, with little\r\nboxes for rouge and powder; and we said jokingly to each other that it\r\nwould not be a bad idea to take a thing like that home to the lady of\r\nthe house. The dream object, therefore, signifies \xe2\x80\x9c_black toilet_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(German, _toilette_\xe2\x80\x94dress)\xe2\x80\x94mourning\xe2\x80\x94and has direct reference to a death.\r\nThe other end of the dream object reminds us of the \xe2\x80\x9cboat\xe2\x80\x9d (German,\r\n_Nachen_), from the root \xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xb3\xcf\x87\xcf\x85\xcf\x82, as a philological friend has told me,\r\nupon which corpses were laid in prehistoric times and were left to be\r\nburied by the sea. With this circumstance is connected the reason for\r\nthe return of the ships in the dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuietly the old man on his rescued boat drifts into the harbour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is the return voyage after the ship_wreck_ (German, schiff_bruch_;\r\nship-_breaking_, _i.e._ shipwreck), the breakfast-ship looks as though\r\nit were _broken_ off in the middle. But whence comes the name\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbreakfast\xe2\x80\x9d-ship? Here is where the \xe2\x80\x9cEnglish\xe2\x80\x9d comes in, which we have\r\nleft over from the warships. _Breakfast\xe2\x80\x94a breaking of the fast._\r\nBreaking again belongs to ship-_wreck_ (Schiff_bruch_), and _fasting_ is\r\nconnected with the mourning dress.\r\n\r\nThe only thing about this breakfast-ship, which has been newly created\r\nby the dream, is its name. The thing has existed in reality, and recalls\r\nto me the merriest hours of my last journey. As we distrusted the fare\r\nin Aquileja, we took some food with us from Goerz, and bought a bottle\r\nof excellent Istrian wine in Aquileja, and while the little mail-steamer\r\nslowly travelled through the Canal delle Mee and into the lonely stretch\r\nof lagoon towards Grado, we took our breakfast on deck\xe2\x80\x94we were the only\r\npassengers\xe2\x80\x94and it tasted to us as few breakfasts have ever tasted. This,\r\nthen, was the \xe2\x80\x9c_breakfast-ship_,\xe2\x80\x9d and it is behind this very\r\nrecollection of great enjoyment that the dream hides the saddest\r\nthoughts about an unknown and ominous future.\r\n\r\nThe detachment of emotions from the groups of ideas which have been\r\nresponsible for their development is the most striking thing that\r\nhappens to them in the course of dream formation, but it is neither the\r\nonly nor even the most essential change which they undergo on the way\r\nfrom the dream thoughts to the manifest dream. If the affects in the\r\ndream thoughts are compared with those in the dream, it at once becomes\r\nclear that wherever there is an emotion in the dream, this is also to be\r\nfound in the dream thoughts; the converse, however, is not true. In\r\ngeneral, the dream is less rich in affects than the psychic material\r\nfrom which it is elaborated. As soon as I have reconstructed the dream\r\nthoughts I see that the most intense psychic impulses are regularly\r\nstriving in them for self-assertion, usually in conflict with others\r\nthat are sharply opposed to them. If I turn back to the dream, I often\r\nfind it colourless and without any of the more intense strains of\r\nfeeling. Not only the content, but also the affective tone of my\r\nthoughts has been brought by the dream activity to the level of the\r\nindifferent. I might say that a _suppression of the affects_ has taken\r\nplace. Take, for example, the dream of the botanical monograph. It\r\nanswers to a passionate plea for my freedom to act as I am acting and to\r\narrange my life as seems right to me and to me alone. The dream which\r\nresults from it sounds indifferent; I have written a monograph; it is\r\nlying before me; it is fitted with coloured plates, and dried plants are\r\nto be found with each copy. It is like the peacefulness of a\r\nbattlefield; there is no trace left of the tumult of battle.\r\n\r\nIt may also turn out differently\xe2\x80\x94vivid affective expressions may make\r\ntheir appearance in the dream; but we shall first dwell upon the\r\nunquestionable fact that many dreams appear indifferent, while it is\r\nnever possible to go deeply into the dream thoughts without deep\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\nA complete theoretical explanation of this suppression of emotions in\r\nthe course of the dream activity cannot be given here; it would require\r\na most careful investigation of the theory of the emotions and of the\r\nmechanism of suppression. I shall find a place here for two thoughts\r\nonly. I am forced\xe2\x80\x94on other grounds\xe2\x80\x94to conceive the development of\r\naffects as a centrifugal process directed towards the interior of the\r\nbody, analogous to the processes of motor and secretory innervation.\r\nJust as in the sleeping condition the omission of motor impulses towards\r\nthe outside world seems to be suspended, so a centrifugal excitement of\r\nemotions through unconscious thought may be made more difficult during\r\nsleep. Thus the affective impulses aroused during the discharge of the\r\ndream thoughts would themselves be weak excitements, and therefore those\r\ngetting into the dream would not be stronger. According to this line of\r\nargument the \xe2\x80\x9csuppression of the affects\xe2\x80\x9d would not be a result of the\r\ndream activity at all, but a result of the sleeping condition. This may\r\nbe so, but this cannot possibly be all. We must also remember that all\r\nthe more complex dreams have shown themselves to be a compromised result\r\nfrom the conflict of psychic forces. On the one hand, the thoughts that\r\nconstitute the wish must fight the opposition of a censorship; on the\r\nother hand, we have often seen how, even in unconscious thinking, each\r\ntrain of thought is harnessed to its contradictory opposite. Since all\r\nof these trains of thought are capable of emotion, we shall hardly make\r\na mistake, broadly speaking, if we regard the suppression of emotion as\r\nthe result of the restraint which the contrasts impose upon one another\r\nand which the censor imposes upon the tendencies which it has\r\nsuppressed. _The restraint of affects would accordingly he the second\r\nresult of the dream censor as the disfigurement of the dream was the\r\nfirst._\r\n\r\nI shall insert an example of a dream in which the indifferent affective\r\ntone of the dream content may be explained by a contrast in the dream\r\nthoughts. I have the following short dream to relate, which every reader\r\nwill read with disgust:\r\n\r\nIV. _A bit of rising ground, and on it something like a toilet in the\r\nopen; a very long bench, at the end of which is a large toilet aperture.\r\nAll of the back edge is thickly covered with little heaps of excrement\r\nof all sizes and degrees of freshness. A shrub behind the bench. I\r\nurinate upon the bench; a long stream of urine rinses everything clean,\r\nthe patches of excrement easily come off and fall into the opening. It\r\nseems as though something remained at the end nevertheless._\r\n\r\nWhy did I experience no disgust in this dream?\r\n\r\nBecause, as the analysis shows, the most pleasant and satisfying\r\nthoughts have co-operated in the formation of this dream. Upon analysing\r\nit I immediately think of the Augean stables cleansed by Hercules. I am\r\nthis Hercules. The rising ground and the shrub belong to Aussee, where\r\nmy children are now staying. I have discovered the infantile etiology of\r\nthe neuroses and have thus guarded my own children from becoming ill.\r\nThe bench (omitting the aperture, of course) is the faithful copy of a\r\npiece of furniture which an affectionate female patient has made me a\r\npresent of. This recalls how my patients honour me. Even the museum of\r\nhuman excrement is susceptible of less disagreeable interpretation.\r\nHowever much I am disgusted with it, it is a souvenir of the beautiful\r\nland of Italy, where in little cities, as everyone knows, water-closets\r\nare not equipped in any other way. The stream of urine that washes\r\neverything clean is an unmistakable allusion to greatness. It is in this\r\nmanner that Gulliver extinguishes the great fire in Lilliput; to be\r\nsure, he thereby incurs the displeasure of the tiniest of queens. In\r\nthis way, too, Gargantua, the superman in Master Rabelais, takes\r\nvengeance upon the Parisians, straddling Notre Dame and training his\r\nstream of urine upon the city. Only yesterday I was turning over the\r\nleaves of Garnier\xe2\x80\x99s illustrations of Rabelais before I went to bed. And,\r\nstrangely enough, this is another proof that I am the superman! The\r\nplatform of Notre Dame was my favourite nook in Paris; every free\r\nafternoon I was accustomed to go up into the towers of the church and\r\nclimb about among the monsters and devil-masks there. The circumstances\r\nthat all the excrement vanishes so rapidly before the stream correspond\r\nto the motto: _Afflavit et dissipati sunt_, which I shall some day make\r\nthe title of a chapter on the therapeutics of hysteria.\r\n\r\nAnd now as to the occasion giving rise to the dream. It had been a hot\r\nafternoon in summer; in the evening I had given a lecture on the\r\nrelation between hysteria and the perversions, and everything which I\r\nhad to say displeased me thoroughly, appeared to me stripped of all\r\nvalue. I was tired, found no trace of pleasure in my difficult task, and\r\nlonged to get away from this rummaging in human filth, to see my\r\nchildren and then the beauties of Italy. In this mood I went from the\r\nauditorium to a caf\xc3\xa9, to find some modest refreshment in the open air,\r\nfor my appetite had left me. But one of my audience went with me; he\r\nbegged for permission to sit with me while I drank my coffee and gulped\r\ndown my roll, and began to say flattering things to me. He told me how\r\nmuch he had learned from me, and that he now looked at everything\r\nthrough different eyes, that I had cleansed the Augean stables, _i.e._\r\nthe theory of the neuroses, of its errors and prejudices\xe2\x80\x94in short, that\r\nI was a very great man. My mood was ill-suited to his song of praise; I\r\nstruggled with disgust, and went home earlier in order to extricate\r\nmyself. Before I went to sleep I turned over the leaves of Rabelais, and\r\nread a short story by C. F. Meyer entitled _Die Leiden eines Knaben_\r\n(The Hardships of a Boy).\r\n\r\nThe dream had been drawn from these materials, and the novel by Meyer\r\nadded the recollection of childish scenes (_cf._ the dream about Count\r\nThun, last scene). The mood of the day, characterised by disgust and\r\nannoyance, is continued in the dream in the sense that it is permitted\r\nto furnish nearly the entire material for the dream content. But during\r\nthe night the opposite mood of vigorous and even exaggerated\r\nself-assertion was awakened, and dissipated the earlier mood. The dream\r\nhad to take such a form as to accommodate the expression of\r\nself-depreciation and exaggerated self-assertion in the same material.\r\nThis compromise formation resulted in an ambiguous dream content, but\r\nlikewise in an indifferent strain of feeling owing to the restraint of\r\nthe contrasts upon each other.\r\n\r\nAccording to the theory of wish-fulfilment this dream could not have\r\nhappened had not the suppressed, but at the same time pleasurable, train\r\nof thought concerning personal aggrandisement been coupled with the\r\nopposing thoughts of disgust. For disagreeable things are not intended\r\nto be represented by the dream; painful thoughts that have occurred\r\nduring the day can force their way into the dream only if they lend a\r\ncloak to the wish-fulfilment. The dream activity can dispose of the\r\naffects in the dream thoughts in still another way, besides admitting\r\nthem or reducing them to zero. _It can change them into their opposite._\r\nWe have already become acquainted with the rule of interpretation that\r\nevery element of the dream may be interpreted by its opposite, as well\r\nas by itself. One can never tell at the outset whether to set down the\r\none or the other; only the connection can decide this point. A suspicion\r\nof this state of affairs has evidently got into popular consciousness;\r\ndream books very often proceed according to the principle of contraries\r\nin their interpretation. Such transformation into opposites is made\r\npossible by the intimate concatenation of associations, which in our\r\nthoughts finds the idea of a thing in that of its opposite. Like every\r\nother displacement this serves the purposes of the censor, but it is\r\nalso often the work of the wish-fulfilment, for wish-fulfilment consists\r\nprecisely in this substitution of an unwelcome thing by its opposite.\r\nThe emotions of the dream thoughts may appear in the dream transformed\r\ninto their opposites just as well as the ideas, and it is probable that\r\nthis inversion of emotions is usually brought about by the dream censor.\r\nThe _suppression_ and _inversion of affects_ are useful in social life,\r\nas the current analogy for the dream censor has shown us\xe2\x80\x94above all, for\r\npurposes of dissimulation. If I converse with a person to whom I must\r\nshow consideration while I am saying unpleasant things to him, it is\r\nalmost more important that I should conceal the expression of my emotion\r\nfrom him, than that I modify the wording of my thoughts. If I speak to\r\nhim in polite words, but accompany them by looks or gestures of hatred\r\nand disdain, the effect which I produce upon this person is not very\r\ndifferent from what it would have been if I had recklessly thrown my\r\ncontempt into his face. Above all, then, the censor bids me suppress my\r\nemotions, and if I am master of the art of dissimulation, I can\r\nhypocritically show the opposite emotion\xe2\x80\x94smiling where I should like to\r\nbe angry, and pretending affection where I should like to destroy.\r\n\r\nWe already know of an excellent example of such an inversion of emotion\r\nfor the purposes of the dream censor. In the dream about my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeard I feel great affection for my friend R., at the same time that,\r\nand because, the dream thoughts berate him as a simpleton. We have drawn\r\nour first proof for the existence of the censor from this example of the\r\ninversion of emotions. Nor is it necessary here to assume that the dream\r\nactivity creates a counter emotion of this kind out of nothing; it\r\nusually finds it lying ready in the material of the dream thoughts, and\r\nintensifies it solely with the psychic force of the resisting impulse\r\nuntil a point is reached where the emotion can be won over for the\r\nformation of the dream. In the dream of my uncle, just mentioned, the\r\naffectionate counter emotion has probably originated from an infantile\r\nsource (as the continuation of the dream would suggest), for the\r\nrelation between uncle and nephew has become the source of all my\r\nfriendships and hatreds, owing to the peculiar nature of my childish\r\nexperiences (_cf._ analysis on p. 334).\r\n\r\nThere is a class of dreams deserving the designation \xe2\x80\x9chypocritical,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich puts the theory of wish-fulfilment to a severe test. My attention\r\nwas called to them when Mrs. Dr. M. Hilferding brought up for discussion\r\nin the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society the dream reported by Rosegger,\r\nwhich is reprinted below.\r\n\r\nIn _Waldheimat_, vol. xi., Rosegger writes as follows in his story,\r\n_Fremd gemacht_, p. 303:\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cI have usually enjoyed healthful sleep, but I have lost the rest of\r\n  many a night. With my modest existence as a student and literary man,\r\n  I have for long years dragged along with me the shadow of a veritable\r\n  tailor\xe2\x80\x99s life, like a ghost from which I could not become separated. I\r\n  cannot say that I have occupied myself so often and so vividly with\r\n  thoughts of my past during the day. An assailer of heaven and earth\r\n  arising from the skin of the Philistine has other things to think\r\n  about. Nor did I, as a dashing young fellow, think about my nocturnal\r\n  dreams; only later, when I got into the habit of thinking about\r\n  everything or when the Philistine within me again asserted itself, it\r\n  struck me that whenever I dreamed I was always the journeyman tailor,\r\n  and was always working in my master\xe2\x80\x99s shop for long hours without any\r\n  remuneration. As I sat there and sewed and pressed I was quite aware\r\n  that I no longer belonged there, and that as a burgess of a town I had\r\n  other things to attend to; but I was for ever having vacations, and\r\n  going out into the country, and it was then that I sat near my boss\r\n  and assisted him. I often felt badly, and regretted the loss of time\r\n  which I might spend for better and more useful purposes. If something\r\n  did not come up to the measure and cut exactly, I had to submit to a\r\n  reproach from the boss. Often, as I sat with my back bent in the dingy\r\n  shop, I decided to give notice that I was going to quit. On one\r\n  occasion I actually did so, but the boss took no notice of it, and the\r\n  next time I was again sitting near him and sewing.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cHow happy I was when I woke up after such weary hours! And I then\r\n  resolved that, if this dream came intruding again, I would throw it\r\n  off with energy and would cry aloud: \xe2\x80\x98It is only a delusion, I am in\r\n  bed, and I want to sleep.\xe2\x80\x99... And the next night I would be sitting in\r\n  the tailor shop again.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cThus years passed with dismal regularity. While the boss and I were\r\n  working at Alpelhofer\xe2\x80\x99s, at the house of the peasant where I began my\r\n  apprenticeship, it happened that he was particularly dissatisfied with\r\n  my work. \xe2\x80\x98I should like to know where in the world your thoughts are?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n  cried he, and looked at me gloomily, I thought the most sensible thing\r\n  for me to do would be to get up and explain to the boss that I was\r\n  with him only as a favour, and then leave. But I did not do this. I\r\n  submitted, however, when the boss engaged an apprentice, and ordered\r\n  me to make room for him on the bench. I moved into the corner, and\r\n  kept on sewing. On the same day another tailor was engaged; he was\r\n  bigoted, as he was a Czech who had worked for us nineteen years\r\n  before, and then had fallen into the lake on his way home from the\r\n  public-house. When he tried to sit down there was no room for him. I\r\n  looked at the boss inquiringly, and he said to me, \xe2\x80\x98You have no talent\r\n  for the tailoring business; you may go; you are free.\xe2\x80\x99 My fright on\r\n  that occasion was so overpowering that I awoke.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cThe morning gray glimmered through the clear window of my beloved\r\n  home. Objects of art surrounded me; in the tasteful bookcase stood the\r\n  eternal Homer, the gigantic Dante, the incomparable Shakespeare, the\r\n  glorious Goethe\xe2\x80\x94all shining and immortal. From the adjoining room\r\n  resounded the clear little voices of the children, who were waking and\r\n  prattling with their mother. I felt as if I had found again that\r\n  idyllically sweet, that peaceful, poetical, and spiritual life which I\r\n  have so often and so deeply conceived as the contemplative fortune of\r\n  mankind. And still I was vexed that I had not given my boss notice\r\n  first, instead of allowing him to discharge me.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how remarkable it is; after the night when the boss \xe2\x80\x98discharged\r\n  me\xe2\x80\x99 I enjoyed rest; I no longer dreamed of my tailoring\xe2\x80\x94of this\r\n  experience which lay in the remote past, which in its simplicity was\r\n  really happy, and which, nevertheless, threw a long shadow over the\r\n  later years of my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI. In this dream, the series of the poet who, in his younger years, has\r\nbeen a journeyman tailor, it is hard to recognise the domination of the\r\nwish-fulfilment. All the delightful things occurred during the waking\r\nstate, while the dream seemed to drag along the ghostlike shadow of an\r\nunhappy existence which had been long forgotten. My own dreams of a\r\nsimilar nature have put me in a position to give some explanation for\r\nsuch dreams. As a young doctor I for a long time worked in the chemical\r\ninstitute without being able to accomplish anything in that exacting\r\nscience, and I therefore never think in my waking state about this\r\nunfruitful episode in my life, of which I am really ashamed. On the\r\nother hand, it has become a recurring dream with me that I am working in\r\nthe laboratory, making analyses, and having experiences there, &c.; like\r\nthe examination dreams, these dreams are disagreeable, and they are\r\nnever very distinct. During the analysis of one of these dreams my\r\nattention was directed to the word \xe2\x80\x9canalysis,\xe2\x80\x9d which, gave me the key to\r\nan understanding of these dreams. For I had since become an \xe2\x80\x9canalyst.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nmake analyses which are highly praised\xe2\x80\x94to be sure, psychoanalyses. I\r\nthen understood that when I grew proud of these analyses of the waking\r\nstate, and wanted to boast how much I had accomplished thereby, the\r\ndream would hold up to me at night those other unsuccessful analyses of\r\nwhich I had no reason to be proud; they are the punitive dreams of the\r\nupstart, like those of the tailor who became a celebrated poet. But how\r\nis it possible for the dream to place itself at the service of\r\nself-criticism in its conflict with parvenu-pride, and to take as its\r\ncontent a rational warning instead of the fulfilment of a prohibitive\r\nwish? I have already mentioned that the answer to this question entails\r\nmany difficulties. We may conclude that the foundation of the dream was\r\nat first formed by a phantasy of overweening ambition, but that only its\r\nsuppression and its abashment reached the dream content in its stead.\r\nOne should remember that there are masochistic tendencies in the psychic\r\nlife to which such an inversion might be attributed. But a more thorough\r\ninvestigation of the individual dreams allows the recognition of still\r\nanother element. In an indistinct subordinate portion of one of my\r\nlaboratory dreams, I was just at the age which placed me in the most\r\ngloomy and most unsuccessful year of my professional career; I still had\r\nno position and no means of support, when I suddenly found that I had\r\nthe choice of many women whom I could marry! I was, therefore, young\r\nagain, and, what is more, she was young again\xe2\x80\x94the woman who has shared\r\nwith me all these hard years. In this way one of the wishes which\r\nconstantly frets the heart of the ageing man was revealed as the\r\nunconscious dream inciter. The struggle raging in the other psychic\r\nstrata between vanity and self-criticism has certainly determined the\r\ndream content, but the more deeply-rooted wish of youth has alone made\r\nit possible as a dream. One may say to himself even in the waking state:\r\nTo be sure it is very nice now, and times were once very hard; but it\r\nwas nice, too, even then, you were still so young.\r\n\r\nIn considering dreams reported by a poet one may often assume that he\r\nhas excluded from the report those details which he perceived as\r\ndisturbing and which he considered unessential. His dreams, then, give\r\nus a riddle which could be readily solved if we had an exact\r\nreproduction of the dream content.\r\n\r\nO. Rank has called my attention to the fact that in Grimm\xe2\x80\x99s fairy tale\r\nof the valiant little tailor, or \xe2\x80\x9cSeven at one Stroke,\xe2\x80\x9d a very similar\r\ndream of an upstart is related. The tailor, who became the hero and\r\nmarried the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, dreamed one night while with the princess,\r\nhis wife, about his trade; the latter, becoming suspicious, ordered\r\narmed guards for the following night, who should listen to what was\r\nspoken in the dream, and who should do away with the dreamer. But the\r\nlittle tailor was warned, and knew enough to correct his dream.\r\n\r\nThe complex of processes\xe2\x80\x94of suspension, subtraction, and\r\ninversion\xe2\x80\x94through which the affects of the dream thoughts finally become\r\nthose of the dream, may well be observed in the suitable synthesis of\r\ncompletely analysed dreams. I shall here treat a few cases of emotional\r\nexcitement in the dream which furnish examples of some of the cases\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nIn the dream about the odd task which the elder Bruecke gives me to\r\nperform\xe2\x80\x94of preparing my own pelvis\xe2\x80\x94the _appropriate horror is absent in\r\nthe dream itself_. Now this is a wish-fulfilment in various senses.\r\nPreparation signifies self-analysis, which I accomplish, as it were, by\r\npublishing my book on dreams, and which has been so disagreeable to me\r\nthat I have already postponed printing the finished manuscript for more\r\nthan a year. The wish is now actuated that I may disregard this feeling\r\nof opposition, and for that reason I feel no horror (_Grauen_, which\r\nalso means to grow grey) in the dream. I should also like to escape the\r\nhorror\xe2\x80\x94in the other (German) sense\xe2\x80\x94of growing grey; for I am already\r\ngrowing grey fast, and the grey in my hair warns me withal to hold back\r\nno longer. For we know that at the end of the dream the thought secures\r\nexpression in that I should have to leave my children to get to the goal\r\nof their difficult journey.\r\n\r\nIn the two dreams that shift the expression of satisfaction to the\r\nmoments immediately after awakening, this satisfaction is in the one\r\ncase motivated by the expectation that I am now going to learn what is\r\nmeant by \xe2\x80\x9cI have already dreamed of it,\xe2\x80\x9d and refers in reality to the\r\nbirth of my first child, and in the other case it is motivated by the\r\nconviction that \xe2\x80\x9cthat which has been announced by a sign\xe2\x80\x9d is now going\r\nto happen, and the latter satisfaction is the same which I felt at the\r\narrival of my second son. Here the same emotions that dominated in the\r\ndream thoughts have remained in the dream, but the process is probably\r\nnot so simple as this in every dream. If the two analyses are examined a\r\nlittle, it will be seen that this satisfaction which does not succumb to\r\nthe censor receives an addition from a source which must fear the\r\ncensor; and the emotion drawn from this source would certainly arouse\r\nopposition if it did not cloak itself in a similar emotion of\r\nsatisfaction that is willingly admitted, if it did not, as it were,\r\nsneak in behind the other. Unfortunately, I am unable to show this in\r\nthe case of the actual dream specimen, but an example from another\r\nprovince will make my meaning intelligible. I construct the following\r\ncase: Let there be a person near me whom I hate so that a strong feeling\r\narises in me that I should be glad if something were to happen to him.\r\nBut the moral part of my nature does not yield to this sentiment; I do\r\nnot dare to express this ill-wish, and when something happens to him\r\nwhich he does not deserve, I suppress my satisfaction at it, and force\r\nmyself to expressions and thoughts of regret. Everyone will have found\r\nhimself in such a position. But now let it happen that the hated person\r\ndraws upon himself a well-deserved misfortune by some fault; now I may\r\ngive free rein to my satisfaction that he has been visited by a just\r\npunishment, and I express opinion in the matter which coincides with\r\nthat of many other people who are impartial. But I can see that my\r\nsatisfaction turns out to be more intense than that of the others, for\r\nit has received an addition from another source\xe2\x80\x94from my hatred, which\r\nhas hitherto been prevented by the inner censor from releasing an\r\nemotion, but which is no longer prevented from doing so under the\r\naltered circumstances. This case is generally typical of society, where\r\npersons who have aroused antipathy or are adherents of an unpopular\r\nminority incur guilt. Their punishment does not correspond to their\r\ntransgression but to their transgression _plus_ the ill-will directed\r\nagainst them that has hitherto been ineffective. Those who execute the\r\npunishment doubtless commit an injustice, but they are prevented from\r\nbecoming aware of it by the satisfaction arising from the release within\r\nthemselves of a suppression of long standing. In such cases the emotion\r\nis justified according to its quality, but not according to its\r\nquantity; and the self-criticism that has been appeased as to the one\r\npoint is only too ready to neglect examination of the second point. Once\r\nyou have opened the doors, more people get through than you originally\r\nintended to admit.\r\n\r\nThe striking feature of the neurotic character, that incitements capable\r\nof producing emotion bring about a result that is qualitatively\r\njustified but is quantitatively excessive, is to be explained in this\r\nmanner, in so far as it admits of a psychological explanation at all.\r\nThe excess is due to sources of emotion which have remained unconscious\r\nand have hitherto been suppressed, which can establish in the\r\nassociations a connection with the actual incitement, and which can thus\r\nfind release for its emotions through the vent which the unobjectionable\r\nand admitted source of emotion opens. Our attention is thus called to\r\nthe fact that we may not consider the relation of mutual restraint as\r\nobtaining exclusively between the suppressed and the suppressing psychic\r\njudgment. The cases in which the two judgments bring about a\r\npathological emotion by co-operation and mutual strengthening deserve\r\njust as much attention. The reader is requested to apply these hints\r\nregarding the psychic mechanism for the purpose of understanding the\r\nexpressions of emotion in the dream. A satisfaction which makes its\r\nappearance in the dream, and which may readily be found at its proper\r\nplace in the dream thoughts, may not always be fully explained by means\r\nof this reference. As a rule it will be necessary to search for a second\r\nsource in the dream thoughts, upon which the pressure of the censor is\r\nexerted, and which under the pressure would have resulted not in\r\nsatisfaction, but in the opposite emotion\xe2\x80\x94which, however, is enabled by\r\nthe presence of the first source to free its satisfaction affect from\r\nsuppression and to reinforce the satisfaction springing from the other\r\nsource. Hence emotions in the dream appear as though formed by the\r\nconfluence of several tributaries, and as though over-determined in\r\nreference to the material of the dream thoughts; _sources of affect\r\nwhich can furnish the same affect join each other in the dream activity\r\nin order to produce it_.[FE]\r\n\r\nSome insight into these tangled relations is gained from analysis of the\r\nadmirable dream in which \xe2\x80\x9cNon vixit\xe2\x80\x9d constitutes the central point\r\n(_cf._ p. 333). The expressions of emotion in this dream, which are of\r\ndifferent qualities, are forced together at two points in the manifest\r\ncontent. Hostile and painful feelings (in the dream itself we have the\r\nphrase, \xe2\x80\x9cseized by strange emotions\xe2\x80\x9d) overlap at the point where I\r\ndestroy my antagonistic friend with the two words. At the end of the\r\ndream I am greatly pleased, and am quite ready to believe in a\r\npossibility which I recognise as absurd when I am awake, namely, that\r\nthere are _revenants_ who can be put out of the way by a mere wish.\r\n\r\nI have not yet mentioned the occasion for this dream. It is an\r\nessential one, and goes a long way towards explaining it. I had\r\nreceived the news from my friend in Berlin (whom I have designated as\r\nF.) that he is about to undergo an operation and that relatives of his\r\nliving in Vienna would give me information about his condition. The\r\nfirst few messages after the operation were not reassuring, and caused\r\nme anxiety. I should have liked best to go to him myself, but at that\r\ntime I was affected with a painful disease which made every movement a\r\ntorture for me. I learn from the dream thoughts that I feared for the\r\nlife of my dear friend. I knew that his only sister, with whom I had\r\nnot been acquainted, had died early after the shortest possible\r\nillness. (In the dream _F. tells about his sister, and says: \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\nthree-quarters of an hour she was dead.\xe2\x80\x9d_) I must have imagined that\r\nhis own constitution was not much stronger, and that I should soon be\r\ntravelling, in spite of my health, in answer to far worse news\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthat I should arrive too _late_, for which I should reproach myself\r\nfor ever.[FF] This reproach about arriving too late has become the\r\ncentral point of the dream, but has been represented in a scene in\r\nwhich the honoured teacher of my student years\xe2\x80\x94Bruecke\xe2\x80\x94reproaches me\r\nfor the same thing with a terrible look from his blue eyes. The cause\r\nof this deviation from the scene will soon be clear; the dream cannot\r\nreproduce the scene itself in the manner in which it occurred to me.\r\nTo be sure, it leaves the blue eyes to the other man, but it gives me\r\nthe part of the annihilator, an inversion which is obviously the\r\nresult of the wish-fulfilment. My concern for the life of my friend,\r\nmy self-reproach for not having gone to him, my shame (he had\r\nrepeatedly come to me in Vienna), my desire to consider myself excused\r\non account of my illness\xe2\x80\x94all of this makes up a tempest of feeling\r\nwhich is distinctly felt in sleep, and which raged in every part of\r\nthe dream thoughts.\r\n\r\nBut there was another thing about the occasion for the dream which had\r\nquite the opposite effect. With the unfavourable news during the first\r\ndays of the operation, I also received the injunction to speak to no one\r\nabout the whole affair, which hurt my feelings, for it betrayed an\r\nunnecessary distrust of my discretion. I knew, of course, that this\r\nrequest did not proceed from my friend, but that it was due to\r\nclumsiness or excessive timidity on the part of the messenger, but the\r\nconcealed reproach made me feel very badly because it was not altogether\r\nunjustified. Only reproaches which \xe2\x80\x9chave something in them\xe2\x80\x9d have power\r\nto irritate, as everyone knows. For long before, in the case of two\r\npersons who were friendly to each other and who were willing to honour\r\nme with their friendship, I had quite needlessly tattled what the one\r\nhad said about the other; to be sure this incident had nothing to do\r\nwith the affairs of my friend F. Nor have I forgotten the reproaches\r\nwhich I had to listen to at that time. One of the two friends between\r\nwhom I was the trouble-maker was Professor Fleischl; the other one I may\r\nname Joseph, a name which was also borne by my friend and antagonist P.,\r\nwho appears in the dream.\r\n\r\nTwo dream elements, first _inconspicuously_, and secondly the question\r\nof _Fl. as to how much of his affairs I have mentioned to P._, give\r\nevidence of the reproach that I am incapable of keeping anything to\r\nmyself. But it is the admixture of these recollections which transposes\r\nthe reproach for arriving too late from the present to the time when I\r\nwas living in Bruecke\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory; and by replacing the second person\r\nin the annihilation scene of the dream by a Joseph I succeed in\r\nrepresenting not only the first reproach that I arrive too late, but\r\nalso a second reproach, which is more rigorously suppressed, that I keep\r\nno secrets. The condensing and replacing activity of this dream, as well\r\nas the motives for it, are now obvious.\r\n\r\nMy anger at the injunction not to give anything away, originally quite\r\ninsignificant, receives confirmation from sources that flow far below\r\nthe surface, and so become a swollen stream of hostile feelings towards\r\npersons who are in reality dear to me. The source which furnishes the\r\nconfirmation is to be found in childhood. I have already said that my\r\nfriendships as well as my enmities with persons of my own age go back to\r\nmy childish relations with my nephew, who was a year older than I. In\r\nthese he had the upper hand, and I early learned how to defend myself;\r\nwe lived together inseparably, loved each other, and at the same time,\r\nas statements of older persons testify, scuffled with and accused each\r\nother. In a certain sense all my friends are incarnations of this first\r\nfigure, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich early appeared to my blurred sight\xe2\x80\x9d; they are all\r\n_revenants_. My nephew himself returned in the years of adolescence, and\r\nthen we acted C\xc3\xa6sar and Brutus. An intimate friend and a hated enemy\r\nhave always been indispensable requirements for my emotional life; I\r\nhave always been able to create them anew, and not infrequently my\r\nchildish ideal has been so closely approached that friend and enemy\r\ncoincided in the same person, not simultaneously, of course, nor in\r\nrepeated alterations, as had been the case in my first childhood years.\r\n\r\nI do not here wish to trace the manner in which a recent occasion for\r\nemotion may reach back to one in childhood\xe2\x80\x94through connections like\r\nthese I have just described\xe2\x80\x94in order to find a substitute for itself, in\r\nthis earlier occasion for the sake of increased emotional effect. Such\r\nan investigation would belong to the psychology of the unconscious, and\r\nwould find its place in a psychological explanation of neuroses. Let us\r\nassume for the purposes of dream interpretation that a childhood\r\nrecollection makes its appearance or is formed by the fancy, say to the\r\nfollowing effect: Two children get into a fight on account of some\r\nobject\xe2\x80\x94just what we shall leave undecided, although memory or an\r\nallusion of memory has a very definite one in mind\xe2\x80\x94and each one claims\r\nthat he got to it first, and that he, therefore, has first right to it.\r\nThey come to blows, for might makes right; and, according to the\r\nintimation of the dream, I must have known that I was in the wrong\r\n(_noticing the error myself_), but this time I remain the stronger and\r\ntake possession of the battlefield; the defeated combatant hurries to my\r\nfather, his grandfather, and accuses me, and I defend myself with the\r\nwords which I know from my father: \xe2\x80\x9c_I hit him because he hit me._\xe2\x80\x9d Thus\r\nthis recollection, or more probably fancy, which forces itself upon my\r\nattention in the course of the analysis\xe2\x80\x94from my present knowledge I\r\nmyself do not know how\xe2\x80\x94becomes an intermediary of the dream thoughts\r\nthat collects the emotional excitements obtaining in the dream thoughts,\r\nas the bowl of a fountain collects the streams of water flowing into it.\r\nFrom this point the dream thoughts flow along the following paths: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nserves you quite right if you had to vacate your place for me; why did\r\nyou try to force me out of my place? I don\xe2\x80\x99t need you; I\xe2\x80\x99ll soon find\r\nsomeone else to play with,\xe2\x80\x9d &c. Then the ways are opened through which\r\nthese thoughts again follow into the representation of the dream. For\r\nsuch an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\xb4te-toi que je m\xe2\x80\x99y mette\xe2\x80\x9d I once had to reproach my deceased\r\nfriend Joseph. He had been next to me in the line of promotion in\r\nBruecke\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory, but advancement there was very slow. Neither of\r\nthe two assistants budged from his place, and youth became impatient. My\r\nfriend, who knew that his time of life was limited, and who was bound by\r\nno tie to his superior, was a man seriously ill; the wish for his\r\nremoval permitted an objectionable interpretation\xe2\x80\x94he might be moved by\r\nsomething besides promotion. Several years before, the same wish for\r\nfreedom had naturally been more intense in my own case; wherever in the\r\nworld there are gradations of rank and advancement, the doors are opened\r\nfor wishes needing suppression. Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s Prince Hal cannot get rid\r\nof the temptation to see how the crown fits even at the bed of his sick\r\nfather. But, as may easily be understood, the dream punishes this\r\nruthless wish not upon me but upon him.[FG]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs he was ambitious, I slew him.\xe2\x80\x9d As he could not wait for the other\r\nman to make way for him, he himself has been put out of the way. I\r\nharbour these thoughts immediately after attending the unveiling of the\r\nstatue to the other man at the university. A part of the satisfaction\r\nwhich I feel in the dream may therefore be interpreted: Just punishment;\r\nit served you right.\r\n\r\nAt the funeral of this friend a young man made the following remark,\r\nwhich seemed out of place: \xe2\x80\x9cThe preacher talked as though the world\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t exist without this one human being.\xe2\x80\x9d The displeasure of the\r\nsincere man, whose sorrow has been marred by the exaggeration, begins to\r\narise in him. But with this speech are connected the dream thoughts: \xe2\x80\x9cNo\r\none is really irreplaceable; how many men have I already escorted to the\r\ngrave, but I am still living, I have survived them all, I claim the\r\nfield.\xe2\x80\x9d Such a thought at the moment when I fear that when I travel to\r\nsee him I shall find my friend no longer among the living, permits only\r\nof the further development that I am glad I am surviving someone, that\r\nit is not I who have died, but he\xe2\x80\x94that I occupy the field as I once did\r\nin the fancied scene in childhood. This satisfaction, coming from\r\nsources in childhood, at the fact that I claim the field, covers the\r\nlarger part of the emotion which appears in the dream. I am glad that I\r\nam the survivor\xe2\x80\x94I express this sentiment with the na\xc3\xafve egotism of the\r\nhusband who says to his wife: \xe2\x80\x9cIf one of us dies, I shall move to\r\nParis.\xe2\x80\x9d It is such a matter of course for my expectation that I am not\r\nto be the one.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that great self-control is necessary to interpret\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s dreams and to report them. It is necessary for you to reveal\r\nyourself as the one scoundrel among all the noble souls with whom you\r\nshare the breath of life. Thus, I consider it quite natural that\r\n_revenants_ exist only as long as they are wanted, and that they can be\r\nobviated by a wish. This is the thing for which my friend Joseph has\r\nbeen punished. But the _revenants_ are the successive incarnations of\r\nthe friend of my childhood; I am also satisfied at the fact that I have\r\nreplaced this person for myself again and again, and a substitute will\r\ndoubtless soon be found even for the friend whom I am about to lose. No\r\none is irreplaceable.\r\n\r\nBut what has the dream censor been doing meanwhile? Why does it not\r\nraise the most emphatic objection to a train of thought characterised by\r\nsuch brutal selfishness, and change the satisfaction that adheres to it\r\ninto profound repugnance? I think it is because other unobjectionable\r\ntrains of thought likewise result in satisfaction and cover the emotion\r\ncoming from forbidden infantile sources with their own. In another\r\nstratum of thought I said to myself at that festive unveiling: \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nlost so many dear friends, some through death, some through the\r\ndissolution of friendship\xe2\x80\x94is it not beautiful that I have found\r\nsubstitutes for them, that I have gained one who means more to me than\r\nthe others could, whom I shall from now on always retain, at the age\r\nwhen it is not easy to form new friendships?\xe2\x80\x9d The satisfaction that I\r\nhave found this substitute for lost friends can be taken over into the\r\ndream without interference, but behind it there sneaks in the inimical\r\nsatisfaction from the infantile source. Childish affection undoubtedly\r\nassists in strengthening the justifiable affection of to-day; but\r\nchildish hatred has also found its way into the representation.\r\n\r\nBut besides this there is distinct reference in the dream to another\r\nchain of thoughts, which may manifest itself in the form of\r\nsatisfaction. My friend had shortly before had a little daughter born,\r\nafter long waiting. I knew how much he had grieved for the sister whom\r\nhe lost at an early age, and I wrote to him that he would transfer to\r\nthis child the love he had felt for her. This little girl would at last\r\nmake him forget his irreparable loss.\r\n\r\nThus this chain also connects with the intermediary thoughts of the\r\nlatent dream content, from which the ways spread out in opposite\r\ndirections: No one is irreplaceable. You see, nothing but _revenants_;\r\nall that one has lost comes back. And now the bonds of association\r\nbetween the contradictory elements of the dream thoughts are more\r\ntightly drawn by the accidental circumstance that the little daughter of\r\nmy friend bears the same name as the girl playmate of my own youth, who\r\nwas just my own age and the sister of my oldest friend and antagonist. I\r\nhave heard the name \xe2\x80\x9cPauline\xe2\x80\x9d with _satisfaction_, and in order to\r\nallude to this coincidence I have replaced one Joseph in the dream by\r\nanother Joseph, and have not overlooked the similarity in sound between\r\nthe names Fleischl and F. From this point a train of thought runs to the\r\nnaming of my own children. I insisted that the names should not be\r\nchosen according to the fashion of the day but should be determined by\r\nregard for the memory of beloved persons. The children\xe2\x80\x99s names make them\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_revenants_.\xe2\x80\x9d And, finally, is not the having of children the only\r\naccess to immortality for us all?\r\n\r\nI shall add only a few remarks about the emotions of the dream from\r\nanother point of view. An emotional inclination\xe2\x80\x94what we call a mood\xe2\x80\x94may\r\noccur in the mind of a sleeping person as its dominating element, and\r\nmay induce a corresponding mood in the dream. This mood may be the\r\nresult of the experiences and thoughts of the day, or it may be of\r\nsomatic origin; in either case it will be accompanied by the chains of\r\nthought that correspond to it. The fact that in the one case this\r\npresentation content conditions the emotional inclination primarily, and\r\nthat in the other case it is brought about secondarily by a disposition\r\nof feeling of somatic origin remains without influence upon the\r\nformation of the dream. This formation is always subject to the\r\nrestriction that it can represent only a wish-fulfilment, and that it\r\nmay put its psychic motive force at the service only of the wish. The\r\nmood that is actually present will receive the same treatment as the\r\nsensation which actually comes to the surface during sleep (_cf._ p.\r\n198), which is either neglected or reinterpreted so as to signify a\r\nwish-fulfilment. Disagreeable moods during sleep become a motive force\r\nof the dream by actuating energetic wishes, which the dream must fulfil.\r\nThe material to which they are attached is worked over until it finally\r\nbecomes suitable for the expression of the fulfilled wish. The more\r\nintense and the more dominating the element of the disagreeable mood in\r\nthe dream thought, the more surely will the wish-impulses that have been\r\nmost rigorously suppressed take advantage of the opportunity to secure\r\nrepresentation, for they find that the difficult part of the work\r\nnecessary in securing representation has already been accomplished in\r\nthat the repugnance is already actually in existence, which they would\r\notherwise have had to produce by their own effort. With this discussion\r\nwe again touch upon the problem of anxiety dreams, which we may regard\r\nas bounding the province of the dream activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     (_h_) _Secondary Elaboration._\r\n\r\nWe may at last proceed to an exposition of the fourth of the factors\r\nwhich take part in the formation of the dream.\r\n\r\nIf we continue the examination of the dream content, in the manner\r\nalready outlined\xe2\x80\x94that is, by testing striking occurrences as to their\r\norigin in the dream thoughts\xe2\x80\x94we encounter elements which can be\r\nexplained only by making an entirely new assumption. I have in mind\r\ncases where one shows astonishment, anger, or resistance in a dream, and\r\nthat, too, against a party of the dream content itself. Most of these\r\nexercises of the critical faculty in dreams are not directed against the\r\ndream content, but prove to be portions of dream material which have\r\nbeen taken over and suitably made use of, as I have shown by fitting\r\nexamples. Some things of this sort, however, cannot be disposed of in\r\nsuch a way; their correlative cannot be found in the dream material.\r\nWhat, for instance, is meant by the criticism not infrequent in dreams:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s only a dream\xe2\x80\x9d? This is a genuine criticism of the dream such\r\nas I might make if I were awake. Not at all infrequently it is the\r\nforerunner to waking; still oftener it is preceded by a painful feeling,\r\nwhich subsides when the certainty of the dream state has been\r\nestablished. The thought: \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s only a dream,\xe2\x80\x9d occurring during the\r\ndream, has the same object which is meant to be conveyed on the stage\r\nthrough the mouth of the beautiful Helen von Offenbach; it wants to\r\nminimise what has just occurred and secure indulgence for what is to\r\nfollow. Its purpose is to reassure and, so to speak, put to sleep a\r\ncertain instance which at the given moment has every reason to be active\r\nand to forbid the continuation of the dream\xe2\x80\x94or the scene. It is\r\npleasanter to go on sleeping and to tolerate the dream, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nonly a dream anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d I imagine that the disparaging criticism, \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s only a dream,\xe2\x80\x9d enters into the dream at the moment when the censor,\r\nwhich has never been quite asleep, feels that it has been surprised by\r\nthe already admitted dream. It is too late to suppress the dream, and\r\nthe instance therefore carries with it that note of fear or of painful\r\nfeeling which presents itself in the dream. It is an expression of the\r\n_esprit d\xe2\x80\x99escalier_ on the part of the psychic censor.\r\n\r\nIn this example we have faultless proof that not everything which the\r\ndream contains comes from the dream thoughts, but that a psychic\r\nfunction which cannot be differentiated from our waking thoughts may\r\nmake contributions to the dream content. The question now is, does this\r\noccur only in altogether exceptional cases, or does the psychic instance\r\nwhich is usually active only as censor take a regular part in the\r\nformation of dreams?\r\n\r\nOne must decide unhesitatingly for the latter view. It is indisputable\r\nthat the censoring instance, whose influence we have so far recognised\r\nonly in limitations and omissions in the dream content, is also\r\nresponsible for interpolations and amplifications in this content. Often\r\nthese interpolations are easily recognised; they are reported\r\nirresolutely, prefaced by an \xe2\x80\x9cas if,\xe2\x80\x9d they are not in themselves\r\nparticularly vivid, and are regularly inserted at points where they may\r\nserve to connect two portions of the dream content or improve the\r\nsequence between two sections of the dream. They manifest less ability\r\nto stick in the memory than genuine products of the dream material; if\r\nthe dream is subject to forgetting, they are the first to fall away, and\r\nI am strongly inclined to believe that our frequent complaint that we\r\nhave dreamed so much, that we have forgotten most of this and have\r\nremembered only fragments of it, rests on the immediate falling away of\r\njust these cementing thoughts. In a complete analysis these\r\ninterpolations are often betrayed by the fact that no material is to be\r\nfound for them in the dream thoughts. But after careful examination I\r\nmust designate this case as a rare one; usually interpolated thoughts\r\ncan be traced to an element in the dream thoughts, which, however, can\r\nclaim a place in the dream neither on account of its own merit nor on\r\naccount of over-determination. The psychic function in dream formation,\r\nwhich we are now considering, aspires to the original creations only in\r\nthe most extreme cases; whenever possible, it makes use of anything\r\navailable it can find in the dream material.\r\n\r\nThe thing which distinguishes and reveals this part of the dream\r\nactivity is its tendency. This function proceeds in a manner similar to\r\nthat which the poet spitefully attributes to the philosopher; with its\r\nscraps and rags, it stops up the breaches in the structure of the dream.\r\nThe result of its effort is that the dream loses the appearance of\r\nabsurdity and incoherence, and approaches the pattern of an intelligible\r\nexperience. But the effort is not always crowned with complete success.\r\nThus dreams occur which may seem faultlessly logical and correct upon\r\nsuperficial examination; they start from a possible situation, continue\r\nit by means of consistent changes, and end up\xe2\x80\x94although this is very\r\nrare\xe2\x80\x94with a not unnatural conclusion. These dreams have been subjected\r\nto the most thorough elaboration at the hands of a psychic function\r\nsimilar to our waking thought; they seem to have a meaning, but this\r\nmeaning is very far removed from the real signification of the dream. If\r\nthey are analysed, one is convinced that the secondary elaboration has\r\ndistorted the material very freely, and has preserved its proper\r\nrelations as little as possible. These are the dreams which have, so to\r\nspeak, already been interpreted before we subject them to waking\r\ninterpretation. In other dreams this purposeful elaboration has been\r\nsuccessful only to a certain point; up to this point consistency seems\r\nto be dominant, then the dream becomes nonsensical or confused, and\r\nperhaps finally it lifts itself for a second time in its course to an\r\nappearance of rationality. In still other dreams the elaboration has\r\nfailed completely; we find ourselves helpless in the presence of a\r\nsenseless mass of fragmentary contents.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to deny to this fourth dream-moulding power, which will\r\nsoon seem to us a familiar one\xe2\x80\x94it is in reality the only one among the\r\nfour dream-moulders with which we are familiar,\xe2\x80\x94I do not wish to deny\r\nthis fourth factor the capability of creatively furnishing the dream\r\nwith new contributions. But surely its influence, like that of the\r\nothers, manifests itself preponderatingly in the preferring and choosing\r\nof already created psychic material in the dream thoughts. Now there is\r\na case where it is spared the work, for the most part, of building, as\r\nit were, a fa\xc3\xa7ade to the dream, by the fact that such a structure,\r\nwaiting to be used, is already to be found complete in the material of\r\nthe dream thoughts. The element of the dream thoughts which I have in\r\nmind, I am in the habit of designating as a \xe2\x80\x9cphantasy\xe2\x80\x9d; perhaps I shall\r\navoid misunderstanding if I immediately adduce the day dream of waking\r\nlife as an analogy.[FH] The part played by this element in our psychic\r\nlife has not yet been fully recognised and investigated by the\r\npsychiatrists; in this study M. Benedikt has, it seems to me, made a\r\nhighly promising beginning. The significance of the day dream has not\r\nyet escaped the unerring insight of poets; the description of the day\r\ndreams of one of his subordinate characters which A. Daudet gives us in\r\n_Nabab_ is universally known. A study of the psychoneuroses discloses\r\nthe astonishing fact that these phantasies or day dreams are the\r\nimmediate predecessors of hysterical symptoms\xe2\x80\x94at least of a great many\r\nof them; hysterical symptoms directly depend not upon the memories\r\nthemselves, but upon phantasies built on the basis of memories. The\r\nfrequent occurrence of conscious day phantasies brings these formations\r\nwithin the scope of our knowledge; but just as there are such conscious\r\nphantasies, so there are a great many unconscious ones, which must\r\nremain unconscious on account of their content and on account of their\r\norigin from repressed material. A more thorough examination into the\r\ncharacter of these day phantasies shows with what good reason the same\r\nname has been given to these formations as to the products of our\r\nnocturnal thought,\xe2\x80\x94dreams. They possess an essential part of their\r\nproperties in common with nocturnal dreams; an examination of them would\r\nreally have afforded the shortest and best approach to an understanding\r\nof night dreams.\r\n\r\nLike dreams, they are fulfilments of wishes; like dreams a good part of\r\nthem are based upon the impressions of childish experiences; like dreams\r\ntheir creations enjoy a certain amount of indulgence from the censor. If\r\nwe trace their formation, we see how the wish motive, which is active in\r\ntheir production, has taken the material of which they are built, mixed\r\nit together, rearranged it, and composed it into a new unit. They bear\r\nthe same relation to the childish memories, to which they go back, as\r\nsome of the quaint palaces of Rome bear to the ancient ruins, whose\r\nfreestones and pillars have furnished the material for the structure\r\nbuilt in modern form.\r\n\r\nIn the \xe2\x80\x9csecondary elaboration\xe2\x80\x9d of the dream content which we have\r\nascribed to our fourth dream-making factor, we again find the same\r\nactivity which in the creation of day dreams is allowed to manifest\r\nitself unhampered by other influences. We may say without further\r\npreliminary that this fourth factor of ours seeks to form something\r\n_like a day dream_ from the material at hand. Where, however, such a day\r\ndream has already been formed in connection with the dream thought, this\r\nfactor of the dream-work will preferably get control of it, and strive\r\nto introduce it into the dream content. There are dreams which consist\r\nmerely of the repetition of such a day fancy, a fancy which has perhaps\r\nremained unconscious\xe2\x80\x94as, for instance, the dream of the boy that he is\r\nriding with the heroes of the Trojan war in a war chariot. In my dream\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAutodidasker,\xe2\x80\x9d at least the second part of the dream is the faithful\r\nrepetition of a day phantasy\xe2\x80\x94harmless in itself\xe2\x80\x94about my dealings with\r\nProfessor N. The fact that the phantasy thus provided more often forms\r\nonly one part of the dream, or that only one part of the phantasy that\r\nmakes its way to the dream content, has its origin in the complexity of\r\nthe conditions which the dream must satisfy at its genesis. On the\r\nwhole, the phantasy is treated like any other component of the latent\r\nmaterial; still it is often recognisable in the dream as a whole. In my\r\ndreams parts often occur which are emphasized by an impression different\r\nfrom that of the rest. They seem to me to be in a state of flux, to be\r\nmore coherent and at the same time more transient than other pieces of\r\nthe same dream. I know that these are unconscious phantasies which get\r\ninto the dream by virtue of their association, but I have never\r\nsucceeded in registering such a phantasy. For the rest these phantasies,\r\nlike all other component parts of the dream thoughts, are jumbled\r\ntogether and condensed, one covered up by another, and the like; but\r\nthere are all degrees, from the case where they may constitute the dream\r\ncontent or at least the dream fa\xc3\xa7ade unchanged to the opposite case,\r\nwhere they are represented in the dream content by only one of their\r\nelements or by a remote allusion to such an element. The extent to which\r\nthe phantasies are able to withstand the demands of the censor and the\r\ntendency to condensation are, of course, also decisive of their fate\r\namong the dream thoughts.\r\n\r\nIn my choice of examples for dream analysis I have, wherever possible,\r\navoided those dreams in which unconscious fancies play a somewhat\r\nimportant part, because the introduction of this psychic element would\r\nhave necessitated extensive discussion of the psychology of unconscious\r\nthought. But I cannot entirely omit the \xe2\x80\x9cphantasy\xe2\x80\x9d even in this matter\r\nof examples, because it often gets fully into the dream and still more\r\noften distinctly pervades it. I may mention one more dream, which seems\r\nto be composed of two distinct and opposed phantasies, overlapping each\r\nother at certain places, of which the first is superficial, while the\r\nsecond becomes, as it were, the interpreter of the first.[FI]\r\n\r\nThe dream\xe2\x80\x94it is the only one for which I have no careful notes\xe2\x80\x94is about\r\nto this effect: The dreamer\xe2\x80\x94an unmarried young man\xe2\x80\x94is sitting in an inn,\r\nwhich is seen correctly; several persons come to get him, among them\r\nsomeone who wants to arrest him. He says to his table companions, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwill pay later, I am coming back.\xe2\x80\x9d But they call to him, laughing\r\nscornfully: \xe2\x80\x9cWe know all about that; that\xe2\x80\x99s what everybody says.\xe2\x80\x9d One\r\nguest calls after him: \xe2\x80\x9cThere goes another one.\xe2\x80\x9d He is then led to a\r\nnarrow hall, where he finds a woman with a child in her arms. One of his\r\nescorts says: \xe2\x80\x9cThat is Mr. M\xc3\xbcller.\xe2\x80\x9d A commissioner or some other\r\nofficial is running through a bundle of tickets or papers repeating\r\nM\xc3\xbcller, M\xc3\xbcller, M\xc3\xbcller. At last the commissioner asks him a question,\r\nwhich he answers with \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d He then takes a look at the woman, and\r\nnotices that she has grown a large beard.\r\n\r\nThe two component parts are here easily separated. What is superficial\r\nis the _phantasy of being arrested_; it seems to be newly created by the\r\ndream-work. But behind it appears the _phantasy of marriage_, and this\r\nmaterial, on the contrary, has undergone but slight change at the hands\r\nof the dream activity. The features which are common to both phantasies\r\ncome into distinct prominence as in a Galton\xe2\x80\x99s composite photograph. The\r\npromise of the bachelor to come back to his place at the club table, the\r\nscepticism of the drinking companions, sophisticated in their many\r\nexperiences, the calling after: \xe2\x80\x9cThere goes (marries) another one,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nthese features can easily be capable of the other interpretation.\r\nLikewise the affirmative answer given to the official. Running through\r\nthe bundle of papers with the repetition of the name, corresponds to a\r\nsubordinate but well-recognised feature of the marriage ceremonies\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nreading aloud of the congratulatory telegrams which have arrived\r\nirregularly, and which, of course, are all addressed to the same name.\r\nIn the matter of the bride\xe2\x80\x99s personal appearance in this dream, the\r\nmarriage phantasy has even got the better of the arrest phantasy which\r\nconceals it. The fact that this bride finally displays a beard, I can\r\nexplain from an inquiry\xe2\x80\x94I had no chance to make an analysis. The dreamer\r\nhad on the previous day crossed the street with a friend who was just as\r\nhostile to marriage as himself, and had called his friend\xe2\x80\x99s attention to\r\na beautiful brunette who was coming towards them. The friend had\r\nremarked: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, if only these women wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get beards, as they grow\r\nolder, like their fathers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course there is no lack of elements in this dream, on which the dream\r\ndisfigurement has done more thorough work. Thus the speech: \xe2\x80\x9cI will pay\r\nlater,\xe2\x80\x9d may have reference to the conduct of the father-in-law in the\r\nmatter of dowry\xe2\x80\x94which is uncertain. Obviously all kinds of scruples are\r\npreventing the dreamer from surrendering himself with pleasure to the\r\nphantasy of marrying. One of these apprehensions\xe2\x80\x94lest one\xe2\x80\x99s freedom be\r\nlost when one marries\xe2\x80\x94has embodied itself in the transformation to a\r\nscene of arrest.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the thesis that the dream activity likes to make use of\r\na phantasy which is finished and at hand, instead of creating one afresh\r\nfrom the material of the dream thoughts; we shall perhaps solve one of\r\nthe most interesting riddles of the dream if we keep this fact in mind.\r\nI have on page 21 related the dream of Maury,[48] who is struck on the\r\nback of the neck with a stick, and who awakes in the possession of a\r\nlong dream\xe2\x80\x94a complete romance from the time of the French Revolution.\r\nSince the dream is represented as coherent and as explicable by\r\nreference to the disturbing stimulus alone, about the occurrence of\r\nwhich stimulus the sleeper could suspect nothing, only one assumption\r\nseems to be left, namely, that the whole richly elaborated dream must\r\nhave been composed and must have taken place in the short space of time\r\nbetween the falling of the stick on Maury\xe2\x80\x99s cervical vertebra and the\r\nawakening induced by the blow. We should not feel justified in ascribing\r\nsuch rapidity to the waking mental activity, and so are inclined to\r\ncredit the dream activity with a remarkable acceleration of thought as\r\none of its characteristics.\r\n\r\nAgainst this inference, which rapidly becomes popular, more recent\r\nauthors (Le Lorrain,[45] Egger,[20] and others) have made emphatic\r\nobjection. They partly doubt the correctness with which the dream was\r\nreported by Maury, and partly try to show that the rapidity of our\r\nwaking mental capacity is quite as great as that which we may concede\r\nwithout reservation to the dream activity. The discussion raises\r\nfundamental questions, the settlement of which I do not think concerns\r\nme closely. But I must admit that the argument, for instance, of Egger\r\nhas not impressed me as convincing against the guillotine dream of\r\nMaury. I would suggest the following explanation of this dream: Would it\r\nbe very improbable that the dream of Maury exhibits a phantasy which had\r\nbeen preserved in his memory in a finished state for years, and which\r\nwas awakened\xe2\x80\x94I should rather say alluded to\xe2\x80\x94at the moment when he became\r\naware of the disturbing stimulus? The difficulty of composing such a\r\nlong story with all its details in the exceedingly short space of time\r\nwhich is here at the disposal of the dreamer then disappears; the story\r\nis already composed. If the stick had struck Maury\xe2\x80\x99s neck when he was\r\nawake there would perhaps have been time for the thought: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlike being guillotined.\xe2\x80\x9d But as he is struck by the stick while asleep,\r\nthe dream activity quickly finds occasion in the incoming stimulus to\r\nconstruct a wish-fulfilment, as though it thought (this is to be taken\r\nentirely figuratively): \xe2\x80\x9cHere is a good opportunity to realise the wish\r\nphantasy which I formed at such and such a time while I was reading.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThat this dream romance is just such a one as a youth would be likely to\r\nfashion under the influence of powerful impressions does not seem\r\nquestionable to me. Who would not have been carried away\xe2\x80\x94especially a\r\nFrenchman and a student of the history of civilisation\xe2\x80\x94by descriptions\r\nof the Reign of Terror, in which the aristocracy, men and women, the\r\nflower of the nation, showed that it was possible to die with a light\r\nheart, and preserved their quick wit and refinement of life until the\r\nfatal summons? How tempting to fancy one\xe2\x80\x99s self in the midst of all this\r\nas one of the young men who parts from his lady with a kiss of the hand\r\nto climb fearlessly upon the scaffold! Or perhaps ambition is the ruling\r\nmotive of the phantasy\xe2\x80\x94the ambition to put one\xe2\x80\x99s self in the place of\r\none of those powerful individuals who merely, by the force of their\r\nthinking and their fiery eloquence, rule the city in which the heart of\r\nmankind is beating so convulsively, who are impelled by conviction to\r\nsend thousands of human beings to their death, and who pave the way for\r\nthe transformation of Europe; who, meanwhile, are not sure of their own\r\nheads, and may one day lay them under the knife of the guillotine,\r\nperhaps in the r\xc3\xb4le of one of the Girondists or of the hero Danton? The\r\nfeature, \xe2\x80\x9caccompanied by an innumerable multitude,\xe2\x80\x9d which is preserved\r\nin the memory, seems to show that Maury\xe2\x80\x99s phantasy is an ambitious one\r\nof this sort.\r\n\r\nBut this phantasy, which has for a long time been ready, need not be\r\nexperienced again in sleep; it suffices if it is, so to speak, \xe2\x80\x9ctouched\r\noff.\xe2\x80\x9d What I mean is this: If a few notes are struck and someone says,\r\nas in _Don Juan_: \xe2\x80\x9cThat is from _Figaro\xe2\x80\x99s Wedding_ by Mozart,\xe2\x80\x9d memories\r\nsuddenly surge up within me, none of which I can in the next moment\r\nrecall to consciousness. The characteristic phrase serves as an entrance\r\nstation from which a complete whole is simultaneously put in motion. It\r\nneed not be different in the case of unconscious thought. The psychic\r\nstation which opens the way to the whole guillotine phantasy is set in\r\nmotion by the waking stimulus. This phantasy, however, is not passed in\r\nreview during sleep, but only afterwards in waking memory. Upon\r\nawakening one remembers the details of the phantasy, which in the dream\r\nwas regarded as a whole. There is, withal, no means of making sure that\r\none really has remembered anything which has been dreamed. The same\r\nexplanation, namely, that one is dealing with finished phantasies which\r\nhave been set in motion as wholes by the waking stimulus, may be applied\r\nto still other dreams which proceed from a waking stimulus\xe2\x80\x94for instance\r\nto the battle dream of Napoleon at the explosion of the bomb. I do not\r\nmean to assert that all waking dreams admit of this explanation, or that\r\nthe problem of the accelerated discharge of ideas in dreams is to be\r\naltogether solved in this manner.\r\n\r\nWe must not neglect the relation of this secondary elaboration of the\r\ndream content to the other factors in the dream activity. Might the\r\nprocedure be as follows: the dream-creating factors, the impulse to\r\ncondense, the necessity of evading the censor, and the regard for\r\ndramatic fitness in the psychic resources of the dream\xe2\x80\x94these first of\r\nall create a provisional dream content, and this is then subsequently\r\nmodified until it satisfies the exactions of a second instance? This is\r\nhardly probable. It is necessary rather to assume that the demands of\r\nthis instance are from the very beginning lodged in one of the\r\nconditions which the dream must satisfy, and that this condition, just\r\nlike those of condensation, of censorship, and of dramatic fitness,\r\nsimultaneously affect the whole mass of material in the dream thoughts\r\nin an inductive and selective manner. But of the four conditions\r\nnecessary for the dream formation, the one last recognised is the one\r\nwhose exactions appear to be least binding upon the dream. That this\r\npsychic function, which undertakes the so-called secondary elaboration\r\nof the dream content is identical with the work of our waking thought\r\nmay be inferred with great probability from the following\r\nconsideration:\xe2\x80\x94Our waking (foreconscious) thought behaves towards a\r\ngiven object of perception just exactly as the function in question\r\nbehaves towards the dream content. It is natural for our waking thought\r\nto bring about order in the material of perception, to construct\r\nrelationships, and to make it subject to the requirements of an\r\nintelligible coherence. Indeed, we go too far in doing this; the tricks\r\nof prestidigitators deceive us by taking advantage of this intellectual\r\nhabit. In our effort to put together the sensory impressions which are\r\noffered to us in a comprehensible manner, we often commit the most\r\nbizarre errors and even distort the truth of the material we have before\r\nus. Proofs for this are too generally familiar to need more extended\r\nconsideration here. We fail to see errors in a printed page because our\r\nimagination pictures the proper words. The editor of a widely-read\r\nFrench paper is said to have risked the wager that he could print the\r\nwords \xe2\x80\x9cfrom in front\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfrom behind\xe2\x80\x9d in every sentence of a long\r\narticle without any of his readers noticing it. He won the wager. A\r\ncurious example of incorrect associations years ago caught my attention\r\nin a newspaper. After the session of the French chamber, at which Dupuy\r\nquelled a panic caused by the explosion of a bomb thrown into the hall\r\nby an anarchist by saying calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cLa s\xc3\xa9ance continue,\xe2\x80\x9d the visitors in\r\nthe gallery were asked to testify as to their impression of the\r\nattempted assassination. Among them were two provincials. One of these\r\ntold that immediately after the conclusion of a speech he had heard a\r\ndetonation, but had thought that it was the custom in parliament to fire\r\na shot whenever a speaker had finished. The other, who had apparently\r\nalready heard several speakers, had got the same idea, with the\r\nvariation, however, that he supposed this shooting to be a sign of\r\nappreciation following an especially successful speech.\r\n\r\nThus the psychic instance which approaches the dream content with the\r\ndemand that it must be intelligible, which subjects it to preliminary\r\ninterpretation, and in doing so brings about a complete misunderstanding\r\nof it, is no other than our normal thought. In our interpretation the\r\nrule will be in every case to disregard the apparent coherence of the\r\ndream as being of suspicious origin, and, whether the elements are clear\r\nor confused, to follow the same regressive path to the dream material.\r\n\r\nWe now learn upon what the scale of quality in dreams from confusion to\r\nclearness\xe2\x80\x94mentioned above, page 305\xe2\x80\x94essentially depends. Those parts of\r\nthe dream with which the secondary elaboration has been able to\r\naccomplish something seem to us clear; those where the power of this\r\nactivity has failed seem confused. Since the confused parts of the dream\r\nare often also those which are less vividly imprinted, we may conclude\r\nthat the secondary dream-work is also responsible for a contribution to\r\nthe plastic intensity of the individual dream structures.\r\n\r\nIf I were to seek an object of comparison for the definitive formation\r\nof the dream as it manifests itself under the influence of normal\r\nthinking, none better offers itself than those mysterious inscriptions\r\nwith which _Die Fliegende Blaetter_ has so long amused its readers. The\r\nreader is supposed to find a Latin inscription concealed in a given\r\nsentence which, for the sake of contrast, is in dialect and as\r\nscurrilous as possible in significance. For this purpose the letters are\r\ntaken from their groupings in syllables and are newly arranged. Now and\r\nthen a genuine Latin word results, at other places we think that we have\r\nabbreviations of such words before us, and at still other places in the\r\ninscription we allow ourselves to be carried along over the\r\nsenselessness of the disjointed letters by the semblance of\r\ndisintegrated portions or by breaks in the inscription. If we do not\r\nwish to respond to the jest we must give up looking for an inscription,\r\nmust take the letters as we see them, and must compose them into words\r\nof our mother tongue, unmindful of the arrangement which is offered.\r\n\r\nI shall now undertake a r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 of this extended discussion of the dream\r\nactivity. We were confronted by the question whether the mind exerts all\r\nits capabilities to the fullest development in dream formation, or only\r\na fragment of its capabilities, and these restricted in their activity.\r\nOur investigation leads us to reject such a formulation of the question\r\nentirely as inadequate to our circumstances. But if we are to remain on\r\nthe same ground when we answer as that on which the question is urged\r\nupon us, we must acquiesce in two conceptions which are apparently\r\nopposed and mutually exclusive. The psychic activity in dream formation\r\nresolves itself into two functions\xe2\x80\x94the provision of the dream thoughts\r\nand the transformation of these into the dream content. The dream\r\nthoughts are entirely correct, and are formed with all the psychic\r\nexpenditure of which we are capable; they belong to our thoughts which\r\nhave not become conscious, from which our thoughts which have become\r\nconscious also result by means of a certain transposition. Much as there\r\nmay be about them which is worth knowing and mysterious, these problems\r\nhave no particular relation to the dream, and have no claim to be\r\ntreated in connection with dream problems. On the other hand, there is\r\nthat second portion of the activity which changes the unconscious\r\nthoughts into the dream content, an activity peculiar to dream life and\r\ncharacteristic of it. Now, this peculiar dream-work is much further\r\nremoved from the model of waking thought than even the most decided\r\ndepreciators of psychic activity in dream formation have thought. It is\r\nnot, one might say, more negligent, more incorrect, more easily\r\nforgotten, more incomplete than waking thought; it is something\r\nqualitatively altogether different from waking thought, and therefore\r\nnot in any way comparable to it. It does not in general think,\r\ncalculate, or judge at all, but limits itself to transforming. It can be\r\nexhaustively described if the conditions which must be satisfied at its\r\ncreation are kept in mind. This product, the dream, must at any cost be\r\nwithdrawn from the censor, and for this purpose the dream activity makes\r\nuse of the _displacement of psychic intensities_ up to the\r\ntransvaluation of all psychic values; thoughts must exclusively or\r\npredominatingly be reproduced in the material of visual and acoustic\r\ntraces of memory, and this requirement secures for the dream-work the\r\n_regard for presentability_, which meets the requirement by furnishing\r\nnew displacements. Greater intensities are (probably) to be provided\r\nthan are each night at the disposal of the dream thoughts, and this\r\npurpose is served by the prolific _condensation_ which is undertaken\r\nwith the component parts of the dream thoughts. Little attention is paid\r\nto the logical relations of the thought material; they ultimately find a\r\nveiled representation in the _formal_ peculiarities of the dream. The\r\naffects of the dream thoughts undergo lesser changes than their\r\npresentation content. As a rule they are suppressed; where they are\r\npreserved they are freed from the presentations and put together\r\naccording to their similarity. Only one part of the dream-work\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nrevision varying in amount, made by the partially roused conscious\r\nthought\xe2\x80\x94at all agrees with the conception which the authors have tried\r\nto extend to the entire activity of dream formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n                 THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE DREAM ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the dreams which I have heard from others there is one which at\r\nthis point is especially worthy of our attention. It was told to me by a\r\nfemale patient who in turn had heard it in a lecture on dreams. Its\r\noriginal source is unknown to me. This dream evidently made a deep\r\nimpression upon the lady, as she went so far as to imitate it, _i.e._ to\r\nrepeat the elements of this dream in a dream of her own in order to\r\nexpress by this transference her agreement with it in a certain point.\r\n\r\nThe essential facts of this illustrative dream are as follows: For days\r\nand nights a father had watched at the sick-bed of his child. After the\r\nchild died, he retired to rest in an adjoining room, leaving the door\r\najar, however, so as to enable him to look from his room into the other,\r\nwhere the corpse lay surrounded by burning candles. An old man, who was\r\nleft as a watch, sat near the corpse murmuring prayers. After sleeping a\r\nfew hours the father dreamed that _the child stood near his bed clasping\r\nhis arms and calling out reproachfully, \xe2\x80\x9cFather, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see that I am\r\nburning?\xe2\x80\x9d_ The father woke and noticed a bright light coming from the\r\nadjoining room. Rushing in, he found the old man asleep, and the covers\r\nand one arm of the beloved body burned by the fallen candle.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of this affecting dream is simple enough, and the\r\nexplanation given by the lecturer, as my patient reported it, was\r\ncorrect. The bright light coming through the open door into the eyes of\r\nthe sleeper produced the same impression on him as if he had been awake;\r\nnamely, that a fire had been started near the corpse by a falling\r\ncandle. It is quite possible that on going to sleep he feared that the\r\naged guardian was not equal to his task.\r\n\r\nWe can find nothing to change in this interpretation. We can add only\r\nthat the contents of the dream must be over-determined, and that the\r\ntalking of the child consisted of phrases that it had uttered while\r\nstill living, which recalled to the father important events. Perhaps the\r\ncomplaint, \xe2\x80\x9cI am burning,\xe2\x80\x9d recalled the fever from which the child died,\r\nand the words quoted, \xe2\x80\x9cFather, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d recalled an emotional\r\noccurrence unknown to us.\r\n\r\nBut after we have recognised the dream as a senseful occurrence which\r\ncan be correlated with our psychic existence, it may be surprising that\r\na dream should have taken place under circumstances which necessitated\r\nsuch immediate awakening. We also notice that the dream does not lack\r\nthe wish-fulfilment. The child acts as if living; it warns the father\r\nitself; it comes to his bed and clasps his arms, as it probably did on\r\nthe occasion which gave origin to the first part of the speech in the\r\ndream. It was for the sake of this wish-fulfilment that the father slept\r\na moment longer. The dream triumphed over the conscious reflection\r\nbecause it could show the child once more alive. If the father had\r\nawakened first, and had then drawn the conclusion which led him into the\r\nadjoining room, he would have shortened the child\xe2\x80\x99s life by this one\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar feature in this brief dream which engages our interest is\r\nquite plain. So far we have mainly endeavoured to ascertain wherein the\r\nsecret meaning of the dream consists, in what way this is to be\r\ndiscovered, and what means the dream-work uses to conceal it. In other\r\nwords, our greatest interest has hitherto centred on the problems of\r\ninterpretation. We now encounter a dream, however, which can be easily\r\nexplained, the sense of which is plainly presented; and we notice that\r\nin spite of this fact the dream still preserves the essential features\r\nwhich plainly differentiate our dreaming from our conscious thinking,\r\nand thus clearly demands an explanation. After clearing up all the\r\nproblems of interpretation, we can still feel how imperfect our\r\npsychology of the dream is.\r\n\r\nBefore entering, however, into this new territory, let us stop and\r\nreflect whether we have not missed something important on our way\r\nhither. For it must be frankly admitted that we have been traversing the\r\neasy and comfortable part of our journey. Hitherto all the paths we have\r\nfollowed have led, if I mistake not, to light, to explication, and to\r\nfull understanding, but from the moment that we wish to penetrate deeper\r\ninto the psychic processes of the dream all paths lead into darkness. It\r\nis quite impossible to explain the dream as a psychic process, for to\r\nexplain means to trace to the known, and as yet we do not possess any\r\npsychological knowledge under which we can range what may be inferred\r\nfrom our psychological investigation of dreams as their fundamental\r\nexplanation. On the contrary, we shall be compelled to build a series of\r\nnew assumptions concerning the structure of the psychic apparatus and\r\nits active forces; and this we shall have to be careful not to carry\r\nbeyond the simplest logical concatenation, as its value may otherwise\r\nmerge into uncertainty. And, even if we should make no mistake in our\r\nconclusions, and take cognisance of all the logical possibilities\r\ninvolved, we shall still be threatened with complete failure in our\r\nsolution through the probable incompleteness of our elemental data. It\r\nwill also be impossible to gain, or at least to establish, an\r\nexplanation for the construction and workings of the psychic instrument\r\neven through a most careful investigation of the dream or any other\r\n_single_ activity. On the contrary, it will be necessary for this end to\r\nbring together whatever appears decisively as constant after a\r\ncomparative study of a whole series of psychic activities. Thus the\r\npsychological conceptions which we shall gain from an analysis of the\r\ndream process will have to wait, as it were, at the junction point until\r\nthey can be connected with the results of other investigations which may\r\nhave advanced to the nucleus of the same problem from another starting\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     (_a_) _Forgetting in Dreams._\r\n\r\nI propose, then, first, to turn to a subject which has given rise to an\r\nobjection hitherto unnoticed, threatening to undermine the foundation of\r\nour work in dream interpretation. It has been objected in more than one\r\nquarter that the dream which we wish to interpret is really unknown to\r\nus, or, to be more precise, that we have no assurance of knowing it as\r\nit has really occurred (see p. 37). What we recollect of the dream, and\r\nwhat we subject to our methods of interpretation, is in the first place\r\ndisfigured through our treacherous memory, which seems particularly\r\nunfitted to retain the dream, and which may have omitted precisely the\r\nmost important part of the dream content. For, when we pay attention to\r\nour dreams, we often find cause to complain that we have dreamed much\r\nmore than we remember; that, unfortunately, we know nothing more than\r\nthis one fragment, and that even this seems to us peculiarly uncertain.\r\nOn the other hand, everything assures us that our memory reproduces the\r\ndream not only fragmentarily but also delusively and falsely. Just as on\r\nthe one hand we may doubt whether the material dreamt was really as\r\ndisconnected and confused as we remember it, so on the other hand may we\r\ndoubt whether a dream was as connected as we relate it; whether in the\r\nattempt at reproduction we have not filled in the gaps existing or\r\ncaused by forgetfulness with new material arbitrarily chosen; whether we\r\nhave not embellished, rounded off, and prepared the dream so that all\r\njudgment as to its real content becomes impossible. Indeed, one author\r\n(Spitta[64]) has expressed his belief that all that is orderly and\r\nconnected is really first put into the dream during our attempt to\r\nrecall it. Thus we are in danger of having wrested from our hands the\r\nvery subject whose value we have undertaken to determine.\r\n\r\nIn our dream interpretations we have thus far ignored these warnings.\r\nIndeed, the demand for interpretation was, on the contrary, found to be\r\nno less perceptible in the smallest, most insignificant, and most\r\nuncertain ingredients of the dream content than in those containing the\r\ndistinct and definite parts. In the dream of Irma\xe2\x80\x99s injection we read,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI quickly called in Dr. M.,\xe2\x80\x9d and we assumed that even this small\r\naddendum would not have gotten into the dream if it had not had a\r\nspecial derivation. Thus we reached the history of that unfortunate\r\npatient to whose bed I \xe2\x80\x9cquickly\xe2\x80\x9d called in the older colleague. In the\r\napparently absurd dream which treated the difference between 51 and 56\r\nas _quantit\xc3\xa9 n\xc3\xa9glig\xc3\xa9_, the number 51 was repeatedly mentioned. Instead\r\nof finding this self-evident or indifferent, we inferred from it a\r\nsecond train of thought in the latent content of the dream which led to\r\nthe number 51. By following up this clue we came to the fears which\r\nplaced 51 years as a limit of life, this being in most marked contrast\r\nto a dominant train of thought which boastfully knew no limit to life.\r\nIn the dream \xe2\x80\x9cNon Vixit\xe2\x80\x9d I found, as an insignificant interposition that\r\nI at first overlooked, the sentence, \xe2\x80\x9cAs P. does not understand him, Fl.\r\nasks me,\xe2\x80\x9d &c. The interpretation then coming to a standstill, I returned\r\nto these words, and found through them the way to the infantile\r\nphantasy, which appeared in the dream thoughts as an intermediary point\r\nof junction. This came about by means of the poet\xe2\x80\x99s verses:\r\n\r\n                   Seldom have you understood me,\r\n                   Seldom have I understood you,\r\n                   But when we got into the mire,\r\n                   We at once understood each other.\r\n\r\nEvery analysis will demonstrate by examples how the most insignificant\r\nfeatures of the dream are indispensable to the analysis, and how the\r\nfinishing of the task is delayed by the fact that attention is not at\r\nfirst directed to them. In the same way we have in the interpretation of\r\ndreams respected every nuance of verbal expression found in the dream;\r\nindeed, if we were confronted by a senseless or insufficient wording\r\nbetraying an unsuccessful effort to translate the dream in the proper\r\nstyle, we have even respected these defects of expression. In brief,\r\nwhat the authorities have considered arbitrary improvisation, concocted\r\nhastily to suit the occasion, we have treated like a sacred text. This\r\ncontradiction requires an explanation.\r\n\r\nIt is in our favour, without disparagement to the authorities. From the\r\nviewpoint of our newly-acquired understanding concerning the origin of\r\nthe dream, the contradictions fall into perfect agreement. It is true\r\nthat we distort the dream in our attempt to reproduce it; and herein we\r\nfind another instance of what we have designated as the often\r\nmisunderstood secondary elaboration of the dream through the influence\r\nof normal thinking. But this distortion is itself only a part of the\r\nelaboration to which the dream thoughts are regularly subjected by\r\nvirtue of the dream censor. The authorities have here divined or\r\nobserved that part of the dream distortion most obviously at work; to us\r\nthis is of little importance, for we know that a more prolific work of\r\ndistortion, not so easily comprehensible, has already chosen the dream\r\nfrom among the concealed thoughts as its object. The authorities err\r\nonly in considering the modifications of the dream while it is being\r\nrecalled and put in words as arbitrary and insoluble; and hence, as\r\nlikely to mislead us in the interpretation of the dream. We\r\nover-estimate the determination of the psychic. There is nothing\r\narbitrary in this field. It can quite generally be shown that a second\r\ntrain of thought immediately undertakes the determination of the\r\nelements which have been left undetermined by the first. I wish, _e.g._,\r\nto think quite voluntarily of a number. This, however, is impossible.\r\nThe number that occurs to me is definitely and necessarily determined by\r\nthoughts within me which may be far from my momentary intention.[FJ]\r\nJust as far from arbitrary are the modifications which the dream\r\nexperiences through the revision of the waking state. They remain in\r\nassociative connection with the content, the place of which they take,\r\nand serve to show us the way to this content, which may itself be the\r\nsubstitute for another.\r\n\r\nIn the analysis of dreams with patients I am accustomed to institute the\r\nfollowing proof of this assertion, which has never proved unsuccessful.\r\nIf the report of a dream appears to me at first difficult to understand,\r\nI request the dreamer to repeat it. This he rarely does in the same\r\nwords. The passages wherein the expression is changed have become known\r\nto me as the weak points of the dream\xe2\x80\x99s disguise, which are of the same\r\nservice to me as the embroidered mark on Siegfried\xe2\x80\x99s raiment was to\r\nHagen. The analysis may start from these points. The narrator has been\r\nadmonished by my announcement that I mean to take special pains to solve\r\nthe dream, and immediately, under the impulse of resistance, he protects\r\nthe weak points of the dream\xe2\x80\x99s disguise, replacing the treacherous\r\nexpressions by remoter ones. He thus calls my attention to the\r\nexpressions he has dropped. From the efforts made to guard against the\r\nsolution of the dream, I can also draw conclusions as to the care with\r\nwhich the dream\xe2\x80\x99s raiment was woven.\r\n\r\nThe authors are, however, less justified in giving so much importance to\r\nthe doubt which our judgment encounters in relating the dream. It is\r\ntrue that this doubt betrays the lack of an intellectual assurance, but\r\nour memory really knows no guarantees, and yet, much more often than is\r\nobjectively justified, we yield to the pressure of lending credence to\r\nits statements. The doubt concerning the correct representation of the\r\ndream, or of its individual data, is again only an offshoot of the dream\r\ncensor\xe2\x80\x94that is, of the resistance against penetration to consciousness\r\nof the dream thoughts. This resistance has not entirely exhausted itself\r\nin bringing about the displacements and substitutions, and it therefore\r\nadheres as doubt to what has been allowed to pass through. We can\r\nrecognise this doubt all the easier through the fact that it takes care\r\nnot to attack the intensive elements of the dream, but only the weak and\r\nindistinct ones. For we already know that a transvaluation of all the\r\npsychic values has taken place between the dream thoughts and the dream.\r\nThe disfigurement has been made possible only by the alteration of\r\nvalues; it regularly manifests itself in this way and occasionally\r\ncontents itself with this. If doubt attaches to an indistinct element of\r\nthe dream content, we may, following the hint, recognise in this element\r\na direct offshoot of one of the outlawed dream thoughts. It is here just\r\nas it was after a great revolution in one of the republics of antiquity\r\nor of the Renaissance. The former noble and powerful ruling families are\r\nnow banished; all high positions are filled by upstarts; in the city\r\nitself only the very poor and powerless citizens or the distant\r\nfollowers of the vanquished party are tolerated. Even they do not enjoy\r\nthe full rights of citizenship. They are suspiciously watched. Instead\r\nof the suspicion in the comparison, we have in our case the doubt. I\r\ntherefore insist that in the analysis of dreams one should emancipate\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s self from the entire conception of estimating trustworthiness, and\r\nwhen there is the slightest possibility that this or that occurred in\r\nthe dream, it should be treated as a full certainty. Until one has\r\ndecided to reject these considerations in tracing the dream elements,\r\nthe analysis will remain at a standstill. Antipathy toward the element\r\nconcerned shows its psychic effect in the person analysed by the fact\r\nthat the undesirable idea will evoke no thought in his mind. Such effect\r\nis really not self-evident. It would not be inconsistent if one would\r\nsay: \xe2\x80\x9cWhether this or that was contained in the dream I do not know, but\r\nthe following thoughts occur to me in this direction.\xe2\x80\x9d But he never\r\nexpresses himself thus; and it is just this disturbing influence of\r\ndoubt in the analysis that stamps it as an offshoot and instrument of\r\nthe psychic resistance. Psychoanalysis is justly suspicious. One of its\r\nrules reads: _Whatever disturbs the continuation of the work is a\r\nresistance._\r\n\r\nThe forgetting of dreams, too, remains unfathomable as long as we do not\r\nconsider the force of the psychic censor in its explanation. The\r\nfeeling, indeed, that one has dreamt a great deal during the night and\r\nhas retained only a little of it may have another meaning in a number of\r\ncases. It may perhaps signify that the dream-work has continued\r\nperceptibly throughout the night, and has left behind only this short\r\ndream. There is, however, no doubt of the fact that the dream is\r\nprogressively forgotten on awakening. One often forgets it in spite of\r\npainful effort to remember. I believe, however, that just as one\r\ngenerally over-estimates the extent of one\xe2\x80\x99s forgetting, so also one\r\nover-estimates the deficiencies in one\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, judging them by the\r\ngaps occurring in the dream. All that has been lost through forgetting\r\nin a dream content can often be brought back through analysis. At least,\r\nin a whole series of cases, it is possible to discover from one single\r\nremaining fragment, not the dream, to be sure, which is of little\r\nimportance, but all the thoughts of the dream. It requires a greater\r\nexpenditure of attention and self-control in the analysis; that is all.\r\nBut, at the same time, this suggests that the forgetting of the dream\r\ndoes not lack a hostile intention.\r\n\r\nA convincing proof of the purposeful nature of dream-forgetting, in the\r\nservice of resistance, is gained in analysis through the investigation\r\nof a preliminary stage of forgetting.[FK] It often happens that in the\r\nmidst of interpretation work an omitted fragment of the dream suddenly\r\ncomes to the surface. This part of the dream snatched from forgetfulness\r\nis always the most important part. It lies on the shortest road toward\r\nthe solution of the dream, and for that very reason it was most\r\nobjectionable to the resistance. Among the examples of dreams that I\r\nhave collected in connection with this treatise, it once happened that I\r\nhad to interpose subsequently such a piece of dream content. It was a\r\ntravelling dream, which took vengeance upon an unlovable female\r\ntravelling companion; I have left it almost entirely uninterpreted on\r\naccount of its being in part coarse and nasty. The part omitted read: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsaid about a book by Schiller, \xe2\x80\x98It is from \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 but corrected myself, for\r\nI noticed the mistake myself, \xe2\x80\x98It is by.\xe2\x80\x99 Upon this the man remarked to\r\nhis sister, \xe2\x80\x98Indeed, he said it correctly.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe self-correction in dreams, which seems so wonderful to some authors,\r\ndoes not merit consideration by us. I shall rather show from my own\r\nmemory the model for the grammatical error in the dream. I was nineteen\r\nyears old when I visited England for the first time, and spent a day on\r\nthe shore of the Irish Sea. I naturally amused myself by catching the\r\nsea animals left by the waves, and occupied myself in particular with a\r\nstarfish (the dream begins with Hollthurn\xe2\x80\x94Holothurian), when a pretty\r\nlittle girl came over to me and asked me, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it a starfish? Is it\r\nalive?\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, he is alive,\xe2\x80\x9d but was then ashamed of my\r\nmistake and repeated the sentence correctly. For the grammatical mistake\r\nwhich I then made, the dream substitutes another which is quite common\r\nwith Germans. \xe2\x80\x9cDas Buch ist von Schiller\xe2\x80\x9d should not be translated by\r\n_the book is from_, but _the book is by_. That the dream-work produces\r\nthis substitution because the word _from_ makes possible, through\r\nconsonance, a remarkable condensation with the German adjective _fromm_\r\n(pious, devout), no longer surprises us after all that we have heard\r\nabout the aims of the dream-work and about its reckless selection of\r\nmeans of procedure. But what is the meaning of the harmless recollection\r\nof the seashore in relation to the dream? It explains by means of a very\r\ninnocent example that I have used the wrong gender\xe2\x80\x94_i.e._ that I have\r\nput \xe2\x80\x9che,\xe2\x80\x9d the word denoting the sex or the sexual, where it does not\r\nbelong. This is surely one of the keys to the solution of dreams. Who\r\never has heard of the origin of the book-title _Matter and Motion_\r\n(Moli\xc3\xa8re in _Malade Imaginaire_: La mati\xc3\xa8re est-elle laudable?\xe2\x80\x94A motion\r\nof the bowels) will readily be able to supply the missing parts.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I can prove conclusively by a _demonstratio ad oculos_ that\r\nthe forgetting in dreams is in great part due to the activity of\r\nresistance. A patient tells me that he has dreamed, but that the dream\r\nhas vanished without leaving a trace, as if nothing had happened. We\r\ncontinue to work, however; I strike a resistance which I make plain to\r\nthe patient; by encouraging and urging I help him to become reconciled\r\nto some disagreeable thought; and as soon as I have succeeded he\r\nexclaims, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, I can recall what I have dreamed.\xe2\x80\x9d The same resistance\r\nwhich that day disturbed him in the work caused him also to forget the\r\ndream. By overcoming this resistance, I brought the dream to memory.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the patient may, on reaching a certain part of the work,\r\nrecall a dream which took place three, four, or more days before, and\r\nwhich has rested in oblivion throughout all this time.\r\n\r\nPsychoanalytic experience has furnished us with another proof of the\r\nfact that the forgetting of dreams depends more on the resistance than\r\non the strangeness existing between the waking and sleeping states, as\r\nthe authorities have believed. It often happens to me, as well as to the\r\nother analysts and to patients under treatment, that we are awakened\r\nfrom sleep by a dream, as we would say, and immediately thereafter,\r\nwhile in full possession of our mental activity, we begin to interpret\r\nthe dream. In such cases I have often not rested until I gained a full\r\nunderstanding of the dream, and still it would happen that after the\r\nawakening I have just as completely forgotten the interpretation work as\r\nthe dream content itself, though I was aware that I had dreamed and that\r\nI had interpreted the dream. The dream has more frequently taken along\r\ninto forgetfulness the result of the interpretation work than it was\r\npossible for the mental activity to retain the dream in memory. But\r\nbetween this interpretation work and the waking thoughts there is not\r\nthat psychic gap through which alone the authorities wish to explain the\r\nforgetting of dreams. Morton Prince objects to my explanation of the\r\nforgetting of dreams on the ground that it is only a particular example\r\nof amnesia for dissociated states, and that the impossibility of\r\nharmonising my theory with other types of amnesia makes it also\r\nvalueless for other purposes. He thus makes the reader suspect that in\r\nall his description of such dissociated states he has never made the\r\nattempt to find the dynamic explanation for these phenomena. For, had he\r\ndone so, he surely would have discovered that the repression and the\r\nresistance produced thereby \xe2\x80\x9cis quite as well the cause of this\r\ndissociation as of the amnesia for its psychic content.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat the dream is as little forgotten as the other psychic acts, and\r\nthat it clings to memory just as firmly as the other psychic activities\r\nwas demonstrated to me by an experiment which I was able to make while\r\ncompiling this manuscript. I have kept in my notes many dreams of my own\r\nwhich, for some reason at the time I could analyse only imperfectly or\r\nnot at all. In order to get material to illustrate my assertions, I\r\nattempted to subject some of them to analysis from one to two years\r\nlater. I succeeded in this attempt without any exception. Indeed, I may\r\neven state that the interpretation went more easily at this later time\r\nthan at the time when the dreams were recent occurrences. As a possible\r\nexplanation for this fact, I would say that I had gotten over some of\r\nthe resistances which disturbed me at the time of dreaming. In such\r\nsubsequent interpretations I have compared the past results in dream\r\nthoughts with the present, which have usually been more abundant, and\r\nhave invariably found the past results falling under the present without\r\nchange. I have, however, soon put an end to my surprise by recalling\r\nthat I have long been accustomed to interpret dreams from former years\r\nwhich have occasionally been related to me by patients as if they were\r\ndreams of the night before, with the same method and the same success. I\r\nshall report two examples of such delayed dream interpretations in the\r\ndiscussion of anxiety dreams. When I instituted this experiment for the\r\nfirst time, I justly expected that the dream would behave in this\r\nrespect like a neurotic symptom. For when I treat a neurotic, perhaps an\r\nhysteric, by psychoanalysis, I am compelled to find explanations for the\r\nfirst symptoms of the disease which have long been forgotten, just as\r\nfor those still existing which have brought the patient to me; and I\r\nfind the former problem easier to solve than the more exigent one of\r\nto-day. In the _Studien \xc3\xbcber Hysterie_, published as early as 1895, I\r\nwas able to report the explanation of a first hysterical attack of\r\nanxiety which the patient, a woman over forty years of age, had\r\nexperienced in her fifteenth year.[FL]\r\n\r\nI may now proceed in an informal way to some further observations on the\r\ninterpretation of dreams, which will perhaps be of service to the reader\r\nwho wishes to test my assertion by the analysis of his own dreams.\r\n\r\nNo one must expect that the interpretations of his dreams will come to\r\nhim overnight without any exertion. Practice is required even for the\r\nperception of endoptic phenomena and other sensations usually withdrawn\r\nfrom attention, although this group of perceptions is not opposed by any\r\npsychic motive. It is considerably more difficult to become master of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cundesirable presentations.\xe2\x80\x9d He who wishes to do this will have to\r\nfulfil the requirements laid down in this treatise. Obeying the rules\r\nhere given, he will strive during the work to curb in himself every\r\ncritique, every prejudice, and every affective or intellectual\r\none-sidedness. We will always be mindful of the precept of Claude\r\nBernard for the experimenter in the physiological laboratory\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTravailler\r\ncomme une b\xc3\xaate\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94meaning he should be just as persistent, but also just\r\nas unconcerned about the results. He who will follow these counsels will\r\nsurely no longer find the task difficult. The interpretation of a dream\r\ncannot always be accomplished in one session; you often feel, after\r\nfollowing up a concatenation of thoughts, that your working capacity is\r\nexhausted; the dream will not tell you anything more on that day; it is\r\nthen best to break off, and return to the work the following day.\r\nAnother portion of the dream content then solicits your attention, and\r\nyou thus find an opening to a new stratum of the dream thoughts. We may\r\ncall this the \xe2\x80\x9cfractionary\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation of dreams.\r\n\r\nIt is most difficult to induce the beginner in the interpretation of\r\ndreams to recognise the fact that his task is not finished though he is\r\nin possession of a complete interpretation of the dream which is\r\ningenious and connected, and which explains all the elements of the\r\ndream. Besides this another superimposed interpretation of the same\r\ndream may be possible which has escaped him. It is really not simple to\r\nform an idea of the abundant unconscious streams of thought striving for\r\nexpression in our minds, and to believe in the skilfulness displayed by\r\nthe dream-work in hitting, so to speak, with its ambiguous manner of\r\nexpression, seven flies with one stroke, like the journeyman tailor in\r\nthe fairy tale. The reader will constantly be inclined to reproach the\r\nauthor for uselessly squandering his ingenuity, but anyone who has had\r\nexperience of his own will learn to know better.\r\n\r\nThe question whether every dream can be interpreted may be answered in\r\nthe negative. One must not forget that in the work of interpretation one\r\nmust cope with the psychic forces which are responsible for the\r\ndistortion of the dream. Whether one can become master of the inner\r\nresistances through his intellectual interest, his capacity for\r\nself-control, his psychological knowledge, and his practice in dream\r\ninterpretation becomes a question of the preponderance of forces. It is\r\nalways possible to make some progress. One can at least go far enough to\r\nbecome convinced that the dream is an ingenious construction, generally\r\nfar enough to gain an idea of its meaning. It happens very often that a\r\nsecond dream confirms and continues the interpretation assumed for the\r\nfirst. A whole series of dreams running for weeks or months rests on a\r\ncommon basis, and is therefore to be interpreted in connection. In\r\ndreams following each other, it may be often observed how one takes as\r\nits central point what is indicated only as the periphery of the next,\r\nor it is just the other way, so that the two supplement each other in\r\ninterpretation. That the different dreams of the same night are quite\r\nregularly in the interpretation to be treated as a whole I have already\r\nshown by examples.\r\n\r\nIn the best interpreted dreams we must often leave one portion in\r\nobscurity because we observe in the interpretation that it represents\r\nthe beginning of a tangle of dream thoughts which cannot be unravelled\r\nbut which has furnished no new contribution to the dream content. This,\r\nthen, is the keystone of the dream, the place at which it mounts into\r\nthe unknown. For the dream thoughts which we come upon in the\r\ninterpretation must generally remain without a termination, and merge in\r\nall directions into the net-like entanglement of our world of thoughts.\r\nIt is from some denser portion of this texture that the dream-wish then\r\narises like the mushroom from its mycelium.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the facts of dream-forgetting, as we have really\r\nneglected to draw an important conclusion from them. If the waking life\r\nshows an unmistakable intention to forget the dream formed at night,\r\neither as a whole, immediately after awakening, or in fragments during\r\nthe course of the day, and if we recognise as the chief participator in\r\nthis forgetting the psychic resistance against the dream which has\r\nalready performed its part in opposing the dream at night\xe2\x80\x94then the\r\nquestion arises, What has the dream formation actually accomplished\r\nagainst this resistance? Let us consider the most striking case in which\r\nthe waking life has done away with the dream as though it had never\r\nhappened. If we take into consideration the play of the psychic forces,\r\nwe are forced to assert that the dream would have never come into\r\nexistence had the resistance held sway during the night as during the\r\nday. We conclude then, that the resistance loses a part of its force\r\nduring the night; we know that it has not been extinguished, as we have\r\ndemonstrated its interest in the dream formation in the production of\r\nthe distortion. We have, then, forced upon us the possibility that it\r\nabates at night, that the dream formation has become possible with this\r\ndiminution of the resistance, and we thus readily understand that,\r\nhaving regained its full power with the awakening, it immediately sets\r\naside what it was forced to admit as long as it was in abeyance.\r\nDescriptive psychology teaches us that the chief determinant in dream\r\nformation is the dormant state of the mind. We may now add the following\r\nelucidation: _The sleeping state makes dream formation possible by\r\ndiminishing the endopsychic censor._\r\n\r\nWe are certainly tempted to look upon this conclusion as the only one\r\npossible from the facts of dream-forgetting, and to develop from it\r\nfurther deductions concerning the proportions of energy in the sleeping\r\nand waking states. But we shall stop here for the present. When we have\r\npenetrated somewhat deeper into the psychology of the dream we shall\r\nfind that the origin of the dream formation may be differently\r\nconceived. The resistance operating to prevent the dream thoughts coming\r\nto consciousness may perhaps be eluded without suffering diminution _per\r\nse_. It is also plausible that both the factors favourable to dream\r\nformation, the diminution as well as the eluding of the resistance, may\r\nbe made possible simultaneously through the sleeping state. But we shall\r\npause here, and continue this line of thought later.\r\n\r\nThere is another series of objections against our procedure in the dream\r\ninterpretation which we must now consider. In this interpretation we\r\nproceed by dropping all the end-presentations which otherwise control\r\nreflection, we direct our attention to an individual element of the\r\ndream, and then note the unwished-for thoughts that occur to us in this\r\nconnection. We then take up the next component of the dream content, and\r\nrepeat the operation with it; and, without caring in what direction the\r\nthoughts take us, we allow ourselves to be led on by them until we end\r\nby rambling from one subject to another. At the same time, we harbour\r\nthe confident hope that we may in the end, without effort, come upon the\r\ndream thoughts from which our dream originated. Against this the critic\r\nbrings the following objection: That one can arrive somewhere, starting\r\nfrom a single element in the dream is nothing wonderful. Something can\r\nbe associatively connected with every idea. It is remarkable only that\r\none should succeed in hitting the dream thoughts in this aimless and\r\narbitrary excursion of thought. It is probably a self-deception; the\r\ninvestigator follows the chain of association from one element until for\r\nsome reason it is seen to break, when a second element is taken up; it\r\nis thus but natural that the association, originally unbounded, should\r\nnow experience a narrowing. He keeps in mind the former chain of\r\nassociations, and he will therefore in analysis more easily hit upon\r\ncertain thoughts which have something in common with the thoughts from\r\nthe first chain. He then imagines that he has found a thought which\r\nrepresents a point of junction between two elements of the dream. As he,\r\nmoreover, allows himself every freedom of thought connection, excepting\r\nonly the transitions from one idea to another which are made in normal\r\nthinking, it is not finally difficult for him to concoct something which\r\nhe calls the dream thought out of a series of \xe2\x80\x9cintermediary thoughts\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nand without any guarantee, as they are otherwise unknown, he palms these\r\noff as the psychic equivalent of the dream. But all this is accompanied\r\nby arbitrary procedure and over-ingenious exploitation of coincidence.\r\nAnyone who will go to this useless trouble can in this way work out any\r\ndesired interpretation for any dream whatever.\r\n\r\nIf such objections are really advanced against us, we may refer in our\r\ndefence to the agreement of our dream interpretations, to the surprising\r\nconnections with other dream elements which appear in following out the\r\ndifferent particular presentations, and to the improbability that\r\nanything which so perfectly covers and explains the dream as our dream\r\ninterpretations do could be gained otherwise than by following psychic\r\nconnections previously established. We can also justify ourselves by the\r\nfact that the method of dream analysis is identical with the method used\r\nin the solution of hysterical symptoms, where the correctness of the\r\nmethod is attested through the emergence and fading away of the\r\nsymptoms\xe2\x80\x94that is, where the elucidation of the text by the interposed\r\nillustrations finds corroboration. But we have no object in avoiding\r\nthis problem\xe2\x80\x94how one can reach to a pre-established aim by following a\r\nchain of thoughts spun out thus arbitrarily and aimlessly\xe2\x80\x94for, though we\r\nare unable to solve the problem, we can get rid of it entirely.\r\n\r\nIt is in fact demonstrably incorrect to state that we abandon ourselves\r\nto an aimless course of thought when, as in the interpretation of\r\ndreams, we relinquish our reflection and allow the unwished-for idea to\r\ncome to the surface. It can be shown that we can reject only those\r\nend-presentations that are familiar to us, and that as soon as these\r\nstop the unknown, or, as we say more precisely, the unconscious\r\nend-presentations, immediately come into play, which now determined the\r\ncourse of the unwished-for presentations. A mode of thinking without\r\nend-idea can surely not be brought about through any influence we can\r\nexert on our own mental life; nor do I know either of any state of\r\npsychic derangement in which such mode of thought establishes itself.\r\nThe psychiatrists have in this field much too early rejected the\r\nsolidity of the psychic structure. I have ascertained that an\r\nunregulated stream of thoughts, devoid of the end-presentation, occurs\r\nas little in the realm of hysteria and paranoia as in the formation or\r\nsolution of dreams. Perhaps it does not appear at all in the endogenous\r\npsychic affections, but even the deliria of confused states are senseful\r\naccording to the ingenious theory of Leuret and become incomprehensible\r\nto us only through omissions. I have come to the same conviction\r\nwherever I have found opportunity for observation. The deliria are the\r\nwork of a censor which no longer makes any effort to conceal its sway,\r\nwhich, instead of lending its support to a revision no longer obnoxious\r\nto it, cancels regardlessly that which it raises objections against,\r\nthus causing the remnant to appear disconnected. This censor behaves\r\nanalogously to the Russian newspaper censor on the frontier, who allows\r\nto fall into the hands of his protected readers only those foreign\r\njournals that have passed under the black pencil.\r\n\r\nThe free play of the presentations following any associative\r\nconcatenation perhaps makes its appearance in destructive organic brain\r\nlesions. What, however, is taken as such in the psychoneuroses can\r\nalways be explained as the influence of the censor on a series of\r\nthoughts which have been pushed into the foreground by the concealed\r\nend-presentation.[FM] It has been considered an unmistakable sign of\r\nassociation free from the end-presentations when the emerging\r\npresentations (or pictures) were connected with one another by means of\r\nthe so-called superficial associations\xe2\x80\x94that is, by assonance, word\r\nambiguity, and causal connection without inner sense relationship; in\r\nother words, when they were connected through all those associations\r\nwhich we allow ourselves to make use of in wit and play upon words. This\r\ndistinguishing mark proves true for the connections of thought which\r\nlead us from the elements of the dream content to the collaterals, and\r\nfrom these to the thoughts of the dream proper; of this we have in our\r\ndream analysis found many surprising examples. No connection was there\r\ntoo loose and no wit too objectionable to serve as a bridge from one\r\nthought to another. But the correct understanding of such tolerance is\r\nnot remote. _Whenever one psychic element is connected with another\r\nthrough an obnoxious or superficial association, there also exists a\r\ncorrect and more profound connection between the two which succumbs to\r\nthe resistance of the censor._\r\n\r\nThe correct explanation for the predominance of the superficial\r\nassociations is the pressure of the censor, and not the suppression of\r\nthe end-presentations. The superficial associations supplant the deep\r\nones in the presentation whenever the censor renders the normal\r\nconnective paths impassable. It is as if in a mountainous region a\r\ngeneral interruption of traffic, _e.g._, an inundation, should render\r\nimpassable the long and broad thoroughfares; traffic would then have to\r\nbe maintained through inconvenient and steep footpaths otherwise used\r\nonly by the hunter.\r\n\r\nWe can here distinguish two cases which, however, are essentially one.\r\nIn the first case the censor is directed only against the connection of\r\nthe two thoughts, which, having been detached from each other, escape\r\nthe opposition. The two thoughts then enter successively into\r\nconsciousness; their connection remains concealed; but in its place\r\nthere occurs to us a superficial connection between the two which we\r\nwould not otherwise have thought of, and which as a rule connects with\r\nanother angle of the presentation complex instead of with the one giving\r\nrise to the suppressed but essential connection. Or, in the second case,\r\nboth thoughts on account of their content succumb to the censor; both\r\nthen appear not in their correct but in a modified substituted form; and\r\nboth substituted thoughts are so selected that they represent, through a\r\nsuperficial association, the essential relation which existed between\r\nthose which have been replaced by them. Under the pressure of the censor\r\nthe displacement of a normal and vital association by a superficial and\r\napparently absurd one has thus occurred in both cases.\r\n\r\nBecause we know of this displacement we unhesitatingly place reliance\r\neven upon superficial associations in the dream analysis.[FN]\r\n\r\nThe psychoanalysis of neurotics makes prolific use of the two axioms,\r\nfirst that with the abandonment of the conscious end-presentation the\r\ndomination of the train of presentation is transferred to the concealed\r\nend-presentations; and, secondly, that superficial associations are only\r\na substitutive displacement for suppressed and more profound ones;\r\nindeed, psychoanalysis raises these two axioms to pillars of its\r\ntechnique. When I request a patient to dismiss all reflection, and to\r\nreport to me whatever comes into his mind, I firmly cling to the\r\npresupposition that he will not be able to drop the end-idea of the\r\ntreatment, and I feel justified in concluding that what he reports, even\r\nthough seemingly most harmless and arbitrary, has connection with this\r\nmorbid state. My own personality is another end-presentation concerning\r\nwhich the patient has no inkling. The full appreciation, as well as the\r\ndetailed proof of both these explanations, belongs accordingly to the\r\ndescription of the psychoanalytic technique as a therapeutic method. We\r\nhave here reached one of the allied subjects with which we propose to\r\nleave the subject of the interpretation of dreams.[FO]\r\n\r\nOf all the objections only one is correct, and still remains, namely,\r\nthat we ought not to ascribe all mental occurrences of the\r\ninterpretation work to the nocturnal dream-work. In the interpretation\r\nin the waking state we are making a road running from the dream elements\r\nback to the dream thoughts. The dream-work has made its way in the\r\nopposite direction, and it is not at all probable that these roads are\r\nequally passable in the opposite directions. It has, on the contrary,\r\nbeen shown that during the day, by means of new thought connections we\r\nmake paths which strike the intermediate thoughts and the dream thoughts\r\nin different places. We can see how the recent thought material of the\r\nday takes its place in the groups of the interpretation, and probably\r\nalso forces the additional resistance appearing through the night to\r\nmake new and further detours. But the number and form of the collaterals\r\nwhich we thus spin during the day is psychologically perfectly\r\nnegligible if it only leads the way to the desired dream thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          (_b_) _Regression._\r\n\r\nNow that we have guarded against objection, or at least indicated where\r\nour weapons for defence rest, we need no longer delay entering upon the\r\npsychological investigations for which we have so long prepared. Let us\r\nbring together the main results of our investigations up to this point.\r\nThe dream is a momentous psychic act; its motive power is at all times\r\nto fulfil a wish; its indiscernibleness as a wish and its many\r\npeculiarities and absurdities are due to the influence of the psychic\r\ncensor to which it has been subjected during its formation. Apart from\r\nthe pressure to withdraw itself from this censor, the following have\r\nplayed a part in its formation: a strong tendency to the condensation of\r\npsychic material, a consideration for dramatisation into mental\r\npictures, and (though not regularly) a consideration for a rational and\r\nintelligible exterior in the dream structure. From every one of these\r\npropositions the road leads further to psychological postulates and\r\nassumptions. Thus the reciprocal relation of the wish motives and the\r\nfour conditions, as well as the relations of these conditions to one\r\nanother will have to be investigated; and the dream will have to be\r\nbrought into association with the psychic life.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this chapter we cited a dream in order to remind us\r\nof the riddles that are still unsolved. The interpretation of this dream\r\nof the burning child afforded us no difficulties, although it was not\r\nperfectly given in our present sense. We asked ourselves why it was\r\nnecessary, after all, that the father should dream instead of awakening,\r\nand we recognised the wish to represent the child as living as the\r\nsingle motive of the dream. That there was still another wish playing a\r\npart in this connection, we shall be able to show after later\r\ndiscussions. For the present, therefore, we may say that for the sake of\r\nthe wish-fulfilment the mental process of sleep was transformed into a\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nIf the wish realisation is made retrogressive, only one quality still\r\nremains which separates the two forms of psychic occurrences from each\r\nother. The dream thought might have read: \xe2\x80\x9cI see a glimmer coming from\r\nthe room in which the corpse reposes. Perhaps a candle has been upset,\r\nand the child is burning!\xe2\x80\x9d The dream reports the result of this\r\nreflection unchanged, but represents it in a situation which takes place\r\nin the present, and which is conceivable by the senses like an\r\nexperience in the waking state. This, however, is the most common and\r\nthe most striking psychological character of the dream; a thought,\r\nusually the one wished for, is in the dream made objective and\r\nrepresented as a scene, or, according to our belief, as experienced.\r\n\r\nBut how are we now to explain this characteristic peculiarity of the\r\ndream-work, or, to speak more modestly, how are we to bring it into\r\nrelation with the psychic processes?\r\n\r\nOn closer examination, it is plainly seen that there are two pronounced\r\ncharacters in the manifestations of the dream which are almost\r\nindependent of each other. The one is the representation as a present\r\nsituation with the omission of the \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps\xe2\x80\x9d; the other is the\r\ntransformation of the thought into visual pictures and into speech.\r\n\r\nThe transformation in the dream thoughts, which shifts into the present\r\nthe expectation expressed in them, is perhaps in this particular dream\r\nnot so very striking. This is probably in consonance with the special or\r\nrather subsidiary r\xc3\xb4le of the wish-fulfilment in this dream. Let us take\r\nanother dream in which the dream-wish does not separate itself in sleep\r\nfrom a continuation of the waking thoughts, _e.g._, the dream of Irma\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninjection. Here the dream thought reaching representation is in the\r\noptative, \xe2\x80\x9cIf Otto could only be blamed for Irma\xe2\x80\x99s sickness!\xe2\x80\x9d The dream\r\nsuppresses the optative, and replaces it by a simple present, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Otto\r\nis to blame for Irma\xe2\x80\x99s sickness.\xe2\x80\x9d This is therefore the first of the\r\nchanges which even the undistorted dream undertakes with the dream\r\nthought. But we shall not stop long at this first peculiarity of the\r\ndream. We elucidate it by a reference to the conscious phantasy, the day\r\ndream, which behaves similarly with its presentation content. When\r\nDaudet\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Joyeuse wanders through the streets of Paris unemployed\r\nwhile his daughter is led to believe that he has a position and is in\r\nhis office, he likewise dreams in the present of circumstances that\r\nmight help him to obtain protection and a position. The dream therefore\r\nemploys the present in the same manner and with the same right as the\r\nday dream. The present is the tense in which the wish is represented as\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe second quality, however, is peculiar to the dream as distinguished\r\nfrom the day dream, namely, that the presentation content is not\r\nthought, but changed into perceptible images to which we give credence\r\nand which we believe we experience. Let us add, however, that not all\r\ndreams show this transformation of presentation into perceptible images.\r\nThere are dreams which consist solely of thoughts to which we cannot,\r\nhowever, on that account deny the substantiality of dreams. My dream\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAutodidasker\xe2\x80\x94the waking phantasy with Professor N.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is of that nature;\r\nit contains hardly more perceptible elements than if I had thought its\r\ncontent during the day. Moreover, every long dream contains elements\r\nwhich have not experienced the transformation into the perceptible, and\r\nwhich are simply thought or known as we are wont to think or know in our\r\nwaking state. We may also recall here that such transformation of ideas\r\ninto perceptible images does not occur in dreams only but also in\r\nhallucinations and visions which perhaps appear spontaneously in health\r\nor as symptoms in the psychoneuroses. In brief, the relation which we\r\nare investigating here is in no way an exclusive one; the fact remains,\r\nhowever, that where this character of the dream occurs, it appears to us\r\nas the most noteworthy, so that we cannot think of it apart from the\r\ndream life. Its explanation, however, requires a very detailed\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nAmong all the observations on the theory of dreams to be found in\r\nauthorities on the subject, I should like to lay stress upon one as\r\nbeing worth mentioning. The great G. T. Fechner[35] expresses his belief\r\n(_Psychophysik_, Part II., p. 520), in connection with some discussion\r\ndevoted to the dream, that the seat of the dream is elsewhere than in\r\nthe waking ideation. No other theory enables us to conceive the special\r\nqualities of the dream life.\r\n\r\nThe idea which is placed at our disposal is one of psychic locality. We\r\nshall entirely ignore the fact that the psychic apparatus with which we\r\nare here dealing is also familiar to us as an anatomical specimen, and\r\nwe shall carefully avoid the temptation to determine the psychic\r\nlocality in any way anatomically. We shall remain on psychological\r\nground, and we shall think ourselves called upon only to conceive the\r\ninstrument which serves the psychic activities somewhat after the manner\r\nof a compound microscope, a photographic or other similar apparatus. The\r\npsychic locality, then, corresponds to a place within such an apparatus\r\nin which one of the primary elements of the picture comes into\r\nexistence. As is well known, there are in the microscope and telescope\r\npartly fanciful locations or regions in which no tangible portion of the\r\napparatus is located. I think it superfluous to apologise for the\r\nimperfections of this and all similar figures. These comparisons are\r\ndesigned only to assist us in our attempt to make clear the complication\r\nof the psychic activity by breaking up this activity and referring the\r\nsingle activities to the single component parts of the apparatus. No\r\none, so far as I know, has ever ventured to attempt to discover the\r\ncomposition of the psychic instrument through such analysis. I see no\r\nharm in such an attempt. I believe that we may give free rein to our\r\nassumptions provided we at the same time preserve our cool judgment and\r\ndo not take the scaffolding for the building. As we need nothing except\r\nauxiliary ideas for the first approach to any unknown subject, we shall\r\nprefer the crudest and most tangible hypothesis to all others.\r\n\r\nWe therefore conceive the psychic apparatus as a compound instrument,\r\nthe component parts of which let us call instances, or, for the sake of\r\nclearness, systems. We then entertain the expectation that these systems\r\nperhaps maintain a constant spatial relationship to each other like the\r\ndifferent systems of lenses of the telescope, one behind another.\r\nStrictly speaking, there is no need of assuming a real spatial\r\narrangement of the psychic system. It will serve our purpose if a firm\r\nsequence be established through the fact that in certain psychological\r\noccurrences the system will be traversed by the excitement in a definite\r\nchronological order. This sequence may experience an alteration in other\r\nprocesses; such possibility may be left open. For the sake of brevity,\r\nwe shall henceforth speak of the component parts of the apparatus as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xce\xa8-systems.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first thing that strikes us is the fact that the apparatus composed\r\nof \xce\xa8-systems has a direction. All our psychic activities proceed from\r\n(inner or outer) stimuli and terminate in innervations. We thus ascribe\r\nto the apparatus a sensible and a motor end; at the sensible end we find\r\na system which receives the perceptions, and at the motor end another\r\nwhich opens the locks of motility. The psychic process generally takes\r\nits course from the perception end to the motility end. The most common\r\nscheme of the psychic apparatus has therefore the following appearance:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nBut this is only in compliance with the demand long familiar to us, that\r\nthe psychic apparatus must be constructed like a reflex apparatus. The\r\nreflex act remains the model for every psychic activity.\r\n\r\nWe have now reason to admit a first differentiation at the sensible end.\r\nThe perceptions that come to us leave a trace in our psychic apparatus\r\nwhich we may call a \xe2\x80\x9cMemory trace.\xe2\x80\x9d The function which relates to this\r\nmemory trace we call the memory. If we hold seriously to our resolution\r\nto connect the psychic processes into systems, the memory trace can then\r\nconsist only of lasting changes in the elements of the systems. But, as\r\nhas already been shown in other places, obvious difficulties arise if\r\none and the same system faithfully preserves changes in its elements and\r\nstill remains fresh and capable of admitting new motives for change.\r\nFollowing the principle which directs our undertaking, we shall\r\ndistribute these two activities among two different systems. We assume\r\nthat a first system of the apparatus takes up the stimuli of perception,\r\nbut retains nothing from them\xe2\x80\x94that is, it has no memory; and that behind\r\nthis there lies a second system which transforms the momentary\r\nexcitement of the first into lasting traces. This would then be a\r\ndiagram of our psychic apparatus:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nIt is known that from the perceptions that act on the P-system we retain\r\nsomething else as lasting as the content itself. Our perceptions prove\r\nto be connected with one another in memory, and this is especially the\r\ncase when they have once fallen together in simultaneity. We call this\r\nthe fact of association. It is now clear that if the P-system is\r\nentirely lacking in memory, it certainly cannot preserve traces for the\r\nassociations; the individual P-elements would be intolerably hindered in\r\ntheir function if a remnant of former connection should make its\r\ninfluence felt against a new perception. Hence we must, on the contrary,\r\nassume that the memory system is the basis of the association. The fact\r\nof the association, then, consists in this\xe2\x80\x94that, in consequence of the\r\ndiminutions in resistance and a smoothing of the ways from one of the\r\nMem-elements, the excitement transmits itself to a second rather than to\r\na third Mem-system.\r\n\r\nOn further investigation we find it necessary to assume not one but many\r\nsuch Mem-systems, in which the same excitement propagated by the\r\nP-elements experiences a diversified fixation. The first of these\r\nMem-systems will contain in any case the fixation of the association\r\nthrough simultaneity, while in those lying further away the same\r\nexciting material will be arranged according to other forms of\r\nconcurrence; so that relationships of similarity, &c., might perhaps be\r\nrepresented through these later systems. It would naturally be idle to\r\nattempt to report in words the psychic significance of such a system.\r\nIts characteristic would lie in the intimacy of its relations to\r\nelements of raw memory material\xe2\x80\x94that is, if we wish to point to a\r\nprofounder theory in the gradations of the resistances to conduction\r\ntoward these elements.\r\n\r\nWe may insert here an observation of a general nature which points\r\nperhaps to something of importance. The P-system, which possesses no\r\ncapability of preserving changes and hence no memory, furnishes for our\r\nconsciousness the entire manifoldness of the sensible qualities. Our\r\nmemories, on the other hand, are unconscious in themselves; those that\r\nare most deeply impressed form no exception. They can be made conscious,\r\nbut there can be no doubt that they develop all their influences in the\r\nunconscious state. What we term our character is based, to be sure, on\r\nthe memory traces of our impressions, and indeed on these impressions\r\nthat have affected us most strongly, those of our early youth\xe2\x80\x94those that\r\nalmost never become conscious. But when memories become conscious again\r\nthey show no sensible quality or a very slight one in comparison to the\r\nperceptions. If, now, it can be confirmed _that memory and quality\r\nexclude each other, as far as consciousness in the \xce\xa8-systems is\r\nconcerned_, a most promising insight reveals itself to us in the\r\ndeterminations of the neuron excitement.\r\n\r\nWhat we have so far assumed concerning the composition of the psychic\r\napparatus at the sensible end follows regardless of the dream and the\r\npsychological explanations derived from it. The dream, however, serves\r\nas a source of proof for the knowledge of another part of the apparatus.\r\nWe have seen that it became impossible to explain the dream formation\r\nunless we ventured to assume two psychic instances, one of which\r\nsubjected the activity of the other to a critique as a consequence of\r\nwhich the exclusion from consciousness resulted.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the criticising instance entertains closer relations\r\nwith consciousness than the criticised. The former stands between the\r\nlatter and consciousness like a screen. We have, moreover, found\r\nessential reasons for identifying the criticising instance with that\r\nwhich directs our waking life and determines our voluntary conscious\r\nactions. If we now replace these instances in the development of our\r\ntheory by systems, the criticising system is then to be ascribed to the\r\nmotor end because of the fact just mentioned. We now enter both systems\r\nin our scheme, and express by the names given them their relation to\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe last of the systems at the motor end we call the foreconscious in\r\norder to denote that exciting processes in this system can reach\r\nconsciousness without any further detention provided certain other\r\nconditions be fulfilled, _e.g._, the attainment of a certain intensity,\r\na certain distribution of that function which must be called attention,\r\nand the like. This is at the same time the system which possesses the\r\nkeys to voluntary motility. The system behind it we call the unconscious\r\nbecause it has no access to consciousness except through the\r\nforeconscious, in the passage through which its excitement must submit\r\nto certain changes.\r\n\r\nIn which of these systems, now, do we localise the impulse to the dream\r\nformation? For the Sake of simplicity, let us say in the system Unc. To\r\nbe sure we shall find in later discussions that this is not quite\r\ncorrect, that the dream formation is forced to connect with dream\r\nthoughts which belong to the system of the foreconscious. But we shall\r\nlearn later, when we come to deal with the dream-wish, that the motive\r\npower for the dream is furnished by the Unc., and, owing to this latter\r\nmovement, we shall assume the unconscious system as the starting-point\r\nof the dream formation. This dream impulse, like all other thought\r\nstructures, will now strive to continue itself in the foreconscious, and\r\nthence to gain admission to consciousness.\r\n\r\nExperience teaches us that the road leading from the foreconscious to\r\nconsciousness is closed to the dream thoughts during the day by the\r\nresistance of the censor. At night the dream thoughts gain admission to\r\nconsciousness, but the question arises, in what way and because of what\r\nchange. If this admission was rendered possible to the dream thoughts\r\nthrough the fact that the resistance watching on the boundary between\r\nthe unconscious and foreconscious sinks at night, we should then get\r\ndreams in the material of our presentations which did not show the\r\nhallucinatory character which just now interests us.\r\n\r\nThe sinking of the censor between the two systems, Unc. and Forec., can\r\nexplain to us only such dreams as \xe2\x80\x9cAutodidasker,\xe2\x80\x9d but not dreams like\r\nthe one of the burning child, which we have taken as a problem at the\r\noutset in these present investigations.\r\n\r\nWhat takes place in the hallucinatory dream we can describe in no other\r\nway than by saying that the excitement takes a retrogressive course. It\r\ntakes its station, not at the motor end of the apparatus, but at the\r\nsensible end, and finally reaches the system of the perceptions. If we\r\ncall the direction towards which the psychic process continues from the\r\nunconscious into the waking state the progressive, we may then speak of\r\nthe dream as having a regressive character.\r\n\r\nThis regression is surely one of the most important peculiarities of the\r\ndream process; but we must not forget that it does not belong to the\r\ndream alone. The intentional recollection and other processes of our\r\nnormal thinking also require a retrogression in the psychic apparatus\r\nfrom any complex presentation act to the raw material of the memory\r\ntraces lying at its basis. But during the waking state this turning\r\nbackward does not reach beyond the memory pictures; it is unable to\r\nproduce the hallucinatory vividness of the perception pictures. Why is\r\nthis different in the dream? When we spoke of the condensation work of\r\nthe dream we could not avoid the assumption that the intensities\r\nadhering to the presentations are fully transferred from one to another\r\nthrough the dream-work. It is probably this modification of the former\r\npsychic process which makes possible the occupation of the system of P\r\nto its full sensual vividness in the opposite direction from thought.\r\n\r\nI hope that we are far from deluding ourselves about the importance of\r\nthis present discussion. We have done nothing more than give a name to\r\nan inexplicable phenomenon. We call it regression if the presentation in\r\nthe dream is changed back to the perceptible image from which it once\r\noriginated. But even this step demands justification. Why this naming,\r\nif it does not teach us anything new? I believe, however, that the name\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRegression\xe2\x80\x9d will serve us to the extent of connecting a fact familiar\r\nto us with a scheme of the psychic apparatus which is supplied with a\r\ndirection. At this point, for the first time, it is worth the trouble to\r\nconstruct such a scheme. For, with the help of this scheme, any other\r\npeculiarity of the dream formation will become clear to us without\r\nfurther reflection. If we look upon the dream as a process of regression\r\nin the assumed psychic apparatus, we can readily understand the\r\nempirically proven fact that all mental relation of the dream thoughts\r\neither is lost in the dream-work or can come to expression only with\r\ndifficulty. According to our scheme, these mental relations are\r\ncontained not in the first Mem-systems, but in those lying further to\r\nthe front, and in the regression they must forfeit their expression in\r\nfavour of the perception pictures. _The structure of the dream thoughts\r\nis in the regression broken up into its raw material._\r\n\r\nBut what change renders possible this regression which is impossible\r\nduring the day? Let us here be content with assumption. There must\r\nevidently be some alterations in the charge of energy belonging to the\r\nsingle systems causing the latter to become accessible or inaccessible\r\nto the discharge of the excitement; but in any such apparatus the same\r\neffect upon the course of excitement might be brought about through more\r\nthan one form of such changes. This naturally reminds us of the state of\r\nsleep and of the many changes of energy this state produces at the\r\nsensible end of the apparatus. During the day there is a continuous\r\ncoursing stream from the \xce\xa8-system of the P toward the motility; this\r\ncurrent ceases at night, and no longer hinders a streaming of the\r\ncurrent of excitement in the opposite direction. This would appear to be\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cseclusion from the outer world\xe2\x80\x9d which according to the theory of\r\nsome authors is supposed to explain the psychological character of the\r\ndream (_vide_ p. 30). In the explanation of the regression of the dream\r\nwe shall, however, have to consider those other regressions which\r\noriginate during morbid waking states. In these other forms the\r\nexplanation just given plainly leaves us in the lurch. Regression takes\r\nplace in spite of the uninterrupted sensible current in a progressive\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThe hallucinations of hysteria and paranoia, as well as the visions of\r\nmentally normal persons, I can explain as actually corresponding to\r\nregressions, being in fact thoughts transformed into images; and only\r\nsuch thoughts are subjected to this transformation as are in intimate\r\nconnection with suppressed or unconscious recollections. As an example I\r\nshall cite one of my youngest hysterical patients\xe2\x80\x94a boy, twelve years\r\nold, who was prevented from falling asleep by \xe2\x80\x9c_green faces with red\r\neyes_,\xe2\x80\x9d which terrified him. The source of this manifestation was the\r\nsuppressed, but once conscious, memory of a boy whom he had often seen\r\nduring four years, and who offered him a deterring example of many\r\nchildish bad habits, including onanism, which now formed the subject of\r\nhis own reproach. His mother had noticed at the time that the complexion\r\nof the ill-bred boy was greenish and that he had _red_ (_i.e. red\r\nbordered_) _eyes_. Hence the terrible vision which constantly served to\r\nremind him of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s warning that such boys become demented, that\r\nthey are unable to make progress at school, and are doomed to an early\r\ndeath. A part of this prediction came true in the case of the little\r\npatient; he could not successfully pursue his high school studies, and,\r\nas appeared on examination of his involuntary fancies, he stood in great\r\ndread of the remainder of the prophecy. However, after a brief period of\r\nsuccessful treatment, his sleep was restored, he lost his fears, and\r\nfinished his scholastic year with an excellent record.\r\n\r\nI may also add here the interpretation of a vision related to me by an\r\nhysteric forty years of age, as having occurred in her normal life. On\r\nopening her eyes one morning she beheld in the room her brother, whom\r\nshe knew to be confined in an insane asylum. Her little son was asleep\r\nby her side. Lest the child should be frightened on seeing his uncle,\r\nand fall into convulsions, she pulled the sheet over the little one;\r\nthis done, the phantom disappeared. This vision is the re-casting of one\r\nof her infantile reminiscences which, although conscious, is most\r\nintimately connected with all the unconscious material in her mind. Her\r\nnursemaid told her that her mother, who had died young (the patient was\r\nthen only a year and a half old), had suffered from epileptic or\r\nhysterical convulsions, which dated back to a fright caused by her\r\nbrother (the patient\xe2\x80\x99s uncle), who appeared to her disguised as a\r\nspectre with a sheet over his head. The vision contains the same\r\nelements as the reminiscence, viz. the appearance of the brother, the\r\nsheet, the fright, and its effect. These elements, however, are ranged\r\nin different relations, and are transferred to other persons. The\r\nobvious motive of the vision, which replaces the idea, is her solicitude\r\nlest her little son, who bore a striking resemblance to his uncle,\r\nshould share the latter\xe2\x80\x99s fate. Both examples here cited are not\r\nentirely unrelated to sleep, and may therefore be unsuitable as proof\r\nfor my assertion. I may therefore refer to my analysis of an\r\nhallucinatory paranoia,[FP] and to the results of my hitherto\r\nunpublished studies on the psychology of the psychoneuroses in order to\r\nemphasize the fact that in these cases of regressive thought\r\ntransformation one must not overlook the influence of a suppressed or\r\nunconscious reminiscence, this being in most cases of an infantile\r\ncharacter. This recollection, so to speak, draws into the regression the\r\nthought with which it is connected, which is prevented from expression\r\nby the censor\xe2\x80\x94that is, into that form of representation in which the\r\nrecollection itself exists psychically. I may here mention as a result\r\nof my studies in hysteria that if we succeed in restoring infantile\r\nscenes to consciousness (whether recollections or fancies) they are seen\r\nas hallucinations, and are divested of this character only after\r\nreproduction. It is also known that the earliest infantile memories\r\nretain the character of perceptible vividness until late in life, even\r\nin persons who are otherwise not visual in memory.\r\n\r\nIf, now, we keep in mind what part is played in the dream thoughts by\r\nthe infantile reminiscences or the phantasies based upon them, how often\r\nfragments of these reminiscences emerge in the dream content, and how\r\noften they even give origin to dream wishes, we cannot deny the\r\nprobability that in the dream, too, the transformation of thoughts into\r\nvisual images may be the result of the attraction exerted by the\r\nvisually represented reminiscences, striving for reanimation, upon the\r\nthoughts severed from consciousness and struggling for expression.\r\nFollowing this conception, we may further describe the dream as a\r\nmodified substitute for the infantile scene produced by transference to\r\nrecent material. The infantile cannot enforce its renewal, and must\r\ntherefore be satisfied to return as a dream.\r\n\r\nThis reference to the significance of the infantile scenes (or of their\r\nphantastic repetitions), as in a manner furnishing the pattern for the\r\ndream content, renders superfluous the assumption made by Scherner and\r\nhis pupils, of an inner source of excitement. Scherner assumes a state\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cvisual excitation\xe2\x80\x9d of internal excitement in the organ of sight when\r\nthe dreams manifest a particular vividness or a special abundance of\r\nvisual elements. We need not object to this assumption, but may be\r\nsatisfied with establishing such state of excitation for the psychic\r\nperceptive system of the organs of vision only; we shall, however,\r\nassert that this state of excitation is formed through the memory, and\r\nis merely a refreshing of the former actual visual excitation. I cannot,\r\nfrom my own experience, give a good example showing such an influence of\r\ninfantile reminiscence; my own dreams are surely less rich in\r\nperceptible elements than I must fancy those of others; but in my most\r\nbeautiful and most vivid dream of late years I can easily trace the\r\nhallucinatory distinctness of the dream contents to the sensuous nature\r\nof recently received impressions. On page 368 I mentioned a dream in\r\nwhich the dark blue colour of the water, the brown colour of the smoke\r\nissuing from the ship\xe2\x80\x99s funnels, and the sombre brown and red of the\r\nbuildings which I had seen made a profound and lasting impression on my\r\nmind. This dream, if any, must be attributed to visual excitation. But\r\nwhat has brought my visual organ into this excitable state? It was a\r\nrecent impression uniting itself with a series of former ones. The\r\ncolours I beheld were those of the toy blocks with which my children\r\nerected a grand structure for my admiration on the day preceding the\r\ndream. The same sombre red colour covered the large blocks and the same\r\nblue and brown the small ones. Connected with these were the colour\r\nimpression of my last journey in Italy, the charming blue of the Isonzo\r\nand the Lagoon, the brown hue of the Alpine region. The beautiful\r\ncolours seen in the dream were but a repetition of those seen in the\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nLet us review what we have learned about this peculiarity which the\r\ndream has of transforming its content of ideas into plastic images. We\r\nhave neither explained this character of the dream-work nor traced it to\r\nknown laws of psychology, but we have singled it out as pointing to\r\nunknown connections, and designated it by the name of the \xe2\x80\x9cregredient\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncharacter. Wherever this regression has occurred, we have regarded it as\r\nan effect of the resistance which opposes the progress of the thought on\r\nits normal way to consciousness, as well as a result of the simultaneous\r\nattraction exerted upon it by the vivid memories present. Regression is\r\nperhaps facilitated in the dream by the cessation of the progressive\r\nstream running from the sense organs during the day. For this auxiliary\r\nmoment there must be compensation in the other forms of regression\r\nthrough a fortifying of the other motives of regression. We must also\r\nbear in mind that in pathological cases of regression, as in the dream,\r\nthe process of transference of energy must be different from that of the\r\nregressions of normal psychic life, as it renders possible a full\r\nhallucinatory occupation of the perception systems. What we have\r\ndescribed in the analysis of the dream-work as \xe2\x80\x9cRegard for Dramatic\r\nFitness\xe2\x80\x9d may be referred to the selective attraction of visually\r\nrecollected scenes, touched by the dream thoughts.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that this first part of our psychological\r\nutilisation of the dream does not entirely satisfy even us. We must,\r\nhowever, console ourselves with the fact that we are compelled to build\r\nin the dark. If we have not altogether strayed from the right path, we\r\nshall be sure to reach about the same ground from another\r\nstarting-point, and thereafter perhaps be better able to see our way.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      (_c_) _The Wish-Fulfilment._\r\n\r\nThe dream of the burning child cited above affords us a welcome\r\nopportunity for appreciating the difficulties confronting the theory of\r\nwish-fulfilment. That the dream should be nothing but a wish-fulfilment\r\nsurely seemed strange to us all\xe2\x80\x94and that not alone because of the\r\ncontradictions offered by the anxiety dream.\r\n\r\nAfter learning from the first analytical explanations that the dream\r\nconceals sense and psychic validity, we could hardly expect so simple a\r\ndetermination of this sense. According to the correct but concise\r\ndefinition of Aristotle, the dream is a continuation of thinking in\r\nsleep (in so far as one sleeps). Considering that during the day our\r\nthoughts produce such a diversity of psychic acts\xe2\x80\x94judgments,\r\nconclusions, contradictions, expectations, intentions, &c.\xe2\x80\x94why should\r\nour sleeping thoughts be forced to confine themselves to the production\r\nof wishes? Are there not, on the contrary, many dreams that present a\r\ndifferent psychic act in dream form, _e.g._, a solicitude, and is not\r\nthe very transparent father\xe2\x80\x99s dream mentioned above of just such a\r\nnature? From the gleam of light falling into his eyes while asleep the\r\nfather draws the solicitous conclusion that a candle has been upset and\r\nmay have set fire to the corpse; he transforms this conclusion into a\r\ndream by investing it with a senseful situation enacted in the present\r\ntense. What part is played in this dream by the wish-fulfilment, and\r\nwhich are we to suspect\xe2\x80\x94the predominance of the thought continued from\r\nthe waking state or of the thought incited by the new sensory\r\nimpression?\r\n\r\nAll these considerations are just, and force us to enter more deeply\r\ninto the part played by the wish-fulfilment in the dream, and into the\r\nsignificance of the waking thoughts continued in sleep.\r\n\r\nIt is in fact the wish-fulfilment that has already induced us to\r\nseparate dreams into two groups. We have found some dreams that were\r\nplainly wish-fulfilments; and others in which wish-fulfilment could not\r\nbe recognised, and was frequently concealed by every available means. In\r\nthis latter class of dreams we recognised the influence of the dream\r\ncensor. The undisguised wish dreams were chiefly found in children, yet\r\nfleeting open-hearted wish dreams _seemed_ (I purposely emphasize this\r\nword) to occur also in adults.\r\n\r\nWe may now ask whence the wish fulfilled in the dream originates. But to\r\nwhat opposition or to what diversity do we refer this \xe2\x80\x9cwhence\xe2\x80\x9d? I think\r\nit is to the opposition between conscious daily life and a psychic\r\nactivity remaining unconscious which can only make itself noticeable\r\nduring the night. I thus find a threefold possibility for the origin of\r\na wish. Firstly, it may have been incited during the day, and owing to\r\nexternal circumstances failed to find gratification, there is thus left\r\nfor the night an acknowledged but unfulfilled wish. Secondly, it may\r\ncome to the surface during the day but be rejected, leaving an\r\nunfulfilled but suppressed wish. Or, thirdly, it may have no relation to\r\ndaily life, and belong to those wishes that originate during the night\r\nfrom the suppression. If we now follow our scheme of the psychic\r\napparatus, we can localise a wish of the first order in the system\r\nForec. We may assume that a wish of the second order has been forced\r\nback from the Forec. system into the Unc. system, where alone, if\r\nanywhere, it can maintain itself; while a wish-feeling of the third\r\norder we consider altogether incapable of leaving the Unc. system. This\r\nbrings up the question whether wishes arising from these different\r\nsources possess the same value for the dream, and whether they have the\r\nsame power to incite a dream.\r\n\r\nOn reviewing the dreams which we have at our disposal for answering this\r\nquestion, we are at once moved to add as a fourth source of the\r\ndream-wish the actual wish incitements arising during the night, such as\r\nthirst and sexual desire. It then becomes evident that the source of the\r\ndream-wish does not affect its capacity to incite a dream. This view is\r\nsupported by the dream of the little girl who continued the sea trip\r\ninterrupted during the day, and by the other children\xe2\x80\x99s dreams referred\r\nto; they are explained by an unfulfilled but not suppressed wish from\r\nthe day-time. That a wish suppressed during the day asserts itself in\r\nthe dream can be shown by a great many examples. I shall mention a very\r\nsimple example of this class. A somewhat sarcastic young lady, whose\r\nyounger friend has become engaged to be married, is asked throughout the\r\nday by her acquaintances whether she knows and what she thinks of the\r\nfianc\xc3\xa9. She answers with unqualified praise, thereby silencing her own\r\njudgment, as she would prefer to tell the truth, namely, that he is an\r\nordinary person (Dutzendmensch).[FQ] The following night she dreams that\r\nthe same question is put to her, and that she replies with the formula:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn case of subsequent orders it will suffice to mention the number.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nFinally, we have learned from numerous analyses that the wish in all\r\ndreams that have been subject to distortion has been derived from the\r\nunconscious, and has been unable to come to perception in the waking\r\nstate. Thus it would appear that all wishes are of the same value and\r\nforce for the dream formation.\r\n\r\nI am at present unable to prove that the state of affairs is really\r\ndifferent, but I am strongly inclined to assume a more stringent\r\ndetermination of the dream-wish. Children\xe2\x80\x99s dreams leave no doubt that\r\nan unfulfilled wish of the day may be the instigator of the dream. But\r\nwe must not forget that it is, after all, the wish of a child, that it\r\nis a wish-feeling of infantile strength only. I have a strong doubt\r\nwhether an unfulfilled wish from the day would suffice to create a dream\r\nin an adult. It would rather seem that as we learn to control our\r\nimpulses by intellectual activity, we more and more reject as vain the\r\nformation or retention of such intense wishes as are natural to\r\nchildhood. In this, indeed, there may be individual variations; some\r\nretain the infantile type of psychic processes longer than others. The\r\ndifferences are here the same as those found in the gradual decline of\r\nthe originally distinct visual imagination.\r\n\r\nIn general, however, I am of the opinion that unfulfilled wishes of the\r\nday are insufficient to produce a dream in adults. I readily admit that\r\nthe wish instigators originating in conscious life contribute towards\r\nthe incitement of dreams, but that is probably all. The dream would not\r\noriginate if the foreconscious wish were not reinforced from another\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nThat source is the unconscious. I believe that _the conscious wish is a\r\ndream inciter only if it succeeds in arousing a similar unconscious wish\r\nwhich reinforces it_. Following the suggestions obtained through the\r\npsychoanalysis of the neuroses, I believe that these unconscious wishes\r\nare always active and ready for expression whenever they find an\r\nopportunity to unite themselves with an emotion from conscious life, and\r\nthat they transfer their greater intensity to the lesser intensity of\r\nthe latter.[FR] It may therefore seem that the conscious wish alone has\r\nbeen realised in a dream; but a slight peculiarity in the formation of\r\nthis dream will put us on the track of the powerful helper from the\r\nunconscious. These ever active and, as it were, immortal wishes from the\r\nunconscious recall the legendary Titans who from time immemorial have\r\nborne the ponderous mountains which were once rolled upon them by the\r\nvictorious gods, and which even now quiver from time to time from the\r\nconvulsions of their mighty limbs; I say that these wishes found in the\r\nrepression are of themselves of an infantile origin, as we have learned\r\nfrom the psychological investigation of the neuroses. I should like,\r\ntherefore, to withdraw the opinion previously expressed that it is\r\nunimportant whence the dream-wish originates, and replace it by another,\r\nas follows: _The wish manifested in the dream must be an infantile one._\r\nIn the adult it originates in the Unc., while in the child, where no\r\nseparation and censor as yet exist between Forec. and Unc., or where\r\nthese are only in the process of formation, it is an unfulfilled and\r\nunrepressed wish from the waking state. I am aware that this conception\r\ncannot be generally demonstrated, but I maintain nevertheless that it\r\ncan be frequently demonstrated, even where it was not suspected, and\r\nthat it cannot be generally refuted.\r\n\r\nThe wish-feelings which remain from the conscious waking state are,\r\ntherefore, relegated to the background in the dream formation. In the\r\ndream content I shall attribute to them only the part attributed to the\r\nmaterial of actual sensations during sleep (see p. 185). If I now take\r\ninto account those other psychic instigations remaining from the waking\r\nstate which are not wishes, I shall only adhere to the line mapped out\r\nfor me by this train of thought. We may succeed in provisionally\r\nterminating the sum of energy of our waking thoughts by deciding to go\r\nto sleep. He is a good sleeper who can do this; Napoleon I. is reputed\r\nto have been a model of this sort. But we do not always succeed in\r\naccomplishing it, or in accomplishing it perfectly. Unsolved problems,\r\nharassing cares, overwhelming impressions continue the thinking activity\r\neven during sleep, maintaining psychic processes in the system which we\r\nhave termed the foreconscious. These mental processes continuing into\r\nsleep may be divided into the following groups: 1, That which has not\r\nbeen terminated during the day owing to casual prevention; 2, that which\r\nhas been left unfinished by temporary paralysis of our mental power,\r\n_i.e._ the unsolved; 3, that which has been rejected and suppressed\r\nduring the day. This unites with a powerful group (4) formed by that\r\nwhich has been excited in our Unc. during the day by the work of the\r\nforeconscious. Finally, we may add group (5) consisting of the\r\nindifferent and hence unsettled impressions of the day.\r\n\r\nWe should not underrate the psychic intensities introduced into sleep by\r\nthese remnants of waking life, especially those emanating from the group\r\nof the unsolved. These excitations surely continue to strive for\r\nexpression during the night, and we may assume with equal certainty that\r\nthe sleeping state renders impossible the usual continuation of the\r\nexcitement in the foreconscious and the termination of the excitement by\r\nits becoming conscious. As far as we can normally become conscious of\r\nour mental processes, even during the night, in so far we are not\r\nasleep. I shall not venture to state what change is produced in the\r\nForec. system by the sleeping state, but there is no doubt that the\r\npsychological character of sleep is essentially due to the change of\r\nenergy in this very system, which also dominates the approach to\r\nmotility, which is paralysed during sleep. In contradistinction to this,\r\nthere seems to be nothing in the psychology of the dream to warrant the\r\nassumption that sleep produces any but secondary changes in the\r\nconditions of the Unc. system. Hence, for the nocturnal excitation in\r\nthe Forec. there remains no other path than that followed by the wish\r\nexcitements from the Unc. This excitation must seek reinforcement from\r\nthe Unc., and follow the detours of the unconscious excitations. But\r\nwhat is the relation of the foreconscious day remnants to the dream?\r\nThere is no doubt that they penetrate abundantly into the dream, that\r\nthey utilise the dream content to obtrude themselves upon consciousness\r\neven during the night; indeed, they occasionally even dominate the dream\r\ncontent, and impel it to continue the work of the day; it is also\r\ncertain that the day remnants may just as well have any other character\r\nas that of wishes; but it is highly instructive and even decisive for\r\nthe theory of wish-fulfilment to see what conditions they must comply\r\nwith in order to be received into the dream.\r\n\r\nLet us pick out one of the dreams cited above as examples, _e.g._, the\r\ndream in which my friend Otto seems to show the symptoms of Basedow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndisease (p. 228). My friend Otto\xe2\x80\x99s appearance occasioned me some concern\r\nduring the day, and this worry, like everything else referring to this\r\nperson, affected me. I may also assume that these feelings followed me\r\ninto sleep. I was probably bent on finding out what was the matter with\r\nhim. In the night my worry found expression in the dream which I have\r\nreported, the content of which was not only senseless, but failed to\r\nshow any wish-fulfilment. But I began to investigate for the source of\r\nthis incongruous expression of the solicitude felt during the day, and\r\nanalysis revealed the connection. I identified my friend Otto with a\r\ncertain Baron L. and myself with a Professor R. There was only one\r\nexplanation for my being impelled to select just this substitution for\r\nthe day thought. I must have always been prepared in the Unc. to\r\nidentify myself with Professor R., as it meant the realisation of one of\r\nthe immortal infantile wishes, viz. that of becoming great. Repulsive\r\nideas respecting my friend, that would certainly have been repudiated in\r\na waking state, took advantage of the opportunity to creep into the\r\ndream, but the worry of the day likewise found some form of expression\r\nthrough a substitution in the dream content. The day thought, which was\r\nno wish in itself but rather a worry, had in some way to find a\r\nconnection with the infantile now unconscious and suppressed wish, which\r\nthen allowed it, though already properly prepared, to \xe2\x80\x9coriginate\xe2\x80\x9d for\r\nconsciousness. The more dominating this worry, the stronger must be the\r\nconnection to be established; between the contents of the wish and that\r\nof the worry there need be no connection, nor was there one in any of\r\nour examples.\r\n\r\nWe can now sharply define the significance of the unconscious wish for\r\nthe dream. It may be admitted that there is a whole class of dreams in\r\nwhich the incitement originates preponderatingly or even exclusively\r\nfrom the remnants of daily life; and I believe that even my cherished\r\ndesire to become at some future time a \xe2\x80\x9cprofessor extraordinarius\xe2\x80\x9d would\r\nhave allowed me to slumber undisturbed that night had not my worry about\r\nmy friend\xe2\x80\x99s health been still active. But this worry alone would not\r\nhave produced a dream; the motive power needed by the dream had to be\r\ncontributed by a wish, and it was the affair of the worriment to procure\r\nfor itself such wish as a motive power of the dream. To speak\r\nfiguratively, it is quite possible that a day thought plays the part of\r\nthe contractor (_entrepreneur_) in the dream. But it is known that no\r\nmatter what idea the contractor may have in mind, and how desirous he\r\nmay be of putting it into operation, he can do nothing without capital;\r\nhe must depend upon a capitalist to defray the necessary expenses, and\r\nthis capitalist, who supplies the psychic expenditure for the dream is\r\ninvariably and indisputably _a wish from the unconscious_, no matter\r\nwhat the nature of the waking thought may be.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the capitalist himself is the contractor for the dream;\r\nthis, indeed, seems to be the more usual case. An unconscious wish is\r\nproduced by the day\xe2\x80\x99s work, which in turn creates the dream. The dream\r\nprocesses, moreover, run parallel with all the other possibilities of\r\nthe economic relationship used here as an illustration. Thus, the\r\nentrepreneur may contribute some capital himself, or several\r\nentrepreneurs may seek the aid of the same capitalist, or several\r\ncapitalists may jointly supply the capital required by the entrepreneur.\r\nThus there are dreams produced by more than one dream-wish, and many\r\nsimilar variations which may readily be passed over and are of no\r\nfurther interest to us. What we have left unfinished in this discussion\r\nof the dream-wish we shall be able to develop later.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9ctertium comparationis\xe2\x80\x9d in the comparisons just employed\xe2\x80\x94_i.e._ the\r\nsum placed at our free disposal in proper allotment\xe2\x80\x94admits of still\r\nfiner application for the illustration of the dream structure. As shown\r\non p. 285 we can recognise in most dreams a centre especially supplied\r\nwith perceptible intensity. This is regularly the direct representation\r\nof the wish-fulfilment; for, if we undo the displacements of the\r\ndream-work by a process of retrogression, we find that the psychic\r\nintensity of the elements in the dream thoughts is replaced by the\r\nperceptible intensity of the elements in the dream content. The elements\r\nadjoining the wish-fulfilment have frequently nothing to do with its\r\nsense, but prove to be descendants of painful thoughts which oppose the\r\nwish. But, owing to their frequently artificial connection with the\r\ncentral element, they have acquired sufficient intensity to enable them\r\nto come to expression. Thus, the force of expression of the\r\nwish-fulfilment is diffused over a certain sphere of association, within\r\nwhich it raises to expression all elements, including those that are in\r\nthemselves impotent. In dreams having several strong wishes we can\r\nreadily separate from one another the spheres of the individual\r\nwish-fulfilments; the gaps in the dream likewise can often be explained\r\nas boundary zones.\r\n\r\nAlthough the foregoing remarks have considerably limited the\r\nsignificance of the day remnants for the dream, it will nevertheless be\r\nworth our while to give them some attention. For they must be a\r\nnecessary ingredient in the formation of the dream, inasmuch as\r\nexperience reveals the surprising fact that every dream shows in its\r\ncontent a connection with some impression of a recent day, often of the\r\nmost indifferent kind. So far we have failed to see any necessity for\r\nthis addition to the dream mixture (p. 153). This necessity appears only\r\nwhen we follow closely the part played by the unconscious wish, and then\r\nseek information in the psychology of the neuroses. We thus learn that\r\nthe unconscious idea, as such, is altogether incapable of entering into\r\nthe foreconscious, and that it can exert an influence there only by\r\nuniting with a harmless idea already belonging to the foreconscious, to\r\nwhich it transfers its intensity and under which it allows itself to be\r\nconcealed. This is the fact of transference which furnishes an\r\nexplanation for so many surprising occurrences in the psychic life of\r\nneurotics.\r\n\r\nThe idea from the foreconscious which thus obtains an unmerited\r\nabundance of intensity may be left unchanged by the transference, or it\r\nmay have forced upon it a modification from the content of the\r\ntransferring idea. I trust the reader will pardon my fondness for\r\ncomparisons from daily life, but I feel tempted to say that the\r\nrelations existing for the repressed idea are similar to the situations\r\nexisting in Austria for the American dentist, who is forbidden to\r\npractise unless he gets permission from a regular physician to use his\r\nname on the public signboard and thus cover the legal requirements.\r\nMoreover, just as it is naturally not the busiest physicians who form\r\nsuch alliances with dental practitioners, so in the psychic life only\r\nsuch foreconscious or conscious ideas are chosen to cover a repressed\r\nidea as have not themselves attracted much of the attention which is\r\noperative in the foreconscious. The unconscious entangles with its\r\nconnections preferentially either those impressions and ideas of the\r\nforeconscious which have been left unnoticed as indifferent, or those\r\nthat have soon been deprived of this attention through rejection. It is\r\na familiar fact from the association studies confirmed by every\r\nexperience, that ideas which have formed intimate connections in one\r\ndirection assume an almost negative attitude to whole groups of new\r\nconnections. I once tried from this principle to develop a theory for\r\nhysterical paralysis.\r\n\r\nIf we assume that the same need for the transference of the repressed\r\nideas which we have learned to know from the analysis of the neuroses\r\nmakes its influence felt in the dream as well, we can at once explain\r\ntwo riddles of the dream, viz. that every dream analysis shows an\r\ninterweaving of a recent impression, and that this recent element is\r\nfrequently of the most indifferent character. We may add what we have\r\nalready learned elsewhere, that these recent and indifferent elements\r\ncome so frequently into the dream content as a substitute for the most\r\ndeep-lying of the dream thoughts, for the further reason that they have\r\nleast to fear from the resisting censor. But while this freedom from\r\ncensorship explains only the preference for trivial elements, the\r\nconstant presence of recent elements points to the fact that there is a\r\nneed for transference. Both groups of impressions satisfy the demand of\r\nthe repression for material still free from associations, the\r\nindifferent ones because they have offered no inducement for extensive\r\nassociations, and the recent ones because they have had insufficient\r\ntime to form such associations.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the day remnants, among which we may now include the\r\nindifferent impressions when they participate in the dream formation,\r\nnot only borrow from the Unc. the motive power at the disposal of the\r\nrepressed wish, but also offer to the unconscious something\r\nindispensable, namely, the attachment necessary to the transference. If\r\nwe here attempted to penetrate more deeply into the psychic processes,\r\nwe should first have to throw more light on the play of emotions between\r\nthe foreconscious and the unconscious, to which, indeed, we are urged by\r\nthe study of the psychoneuroses, whereas the dream itself offers no\r\nassistance in this respect.\r\n\r\nJust one further remark about the day remnants. There is no doubt that\r\nthey are the actual disturbers of sleep, and not the dream, which, on\r\nthe contrary, strives to guard sleep. But we shall return to this point\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nWe have so far discussed the dream-wish, we have traced it to the sphere\r\nof the Unc., and analysed its relations to the day remnants, which in\r\nturn may be either wishes, psychic emotions of any other kind, or simply\r\nrecent impressions. We have thus made room for any claims that may be\r\nmade for the importance of conscious thought activity in dream\r\nformations in all its variations. Relying upon our thought series, it\r\nwould not be at all impossible for us to explain even those extreme\r\ncases in which the dream as a continuer of the day work brings to a\r\nhappy conclusion an unsolved problem of the waking state. We do not,\r\nhowever, possess an example, the analysis of which might reveal the\r\ninfantile or repressed wish source furnishing such alliance and\r\nsuccessful strengthening of the efforts of the foreconscious activity.\r\nBut we have not come one step nearer a solution of the riddle: Why can\r\nthe unconscious furnish the motive power for the wish-fulfilment only\r\nduring sleep? The answer to this question must throw light on the\r\npsychic nature of wishes; and it will be given with the aid of the\r\ndiagram of the psychic apparatus.\r\n\r\nWe do not doubt that even this apparatus attained its present perfection\r\nthrough a long course of development. Let us attempt to restore it as it\r\nexisted in an early phase of its activity. From assumptions, to be\r\nconfirmed elsewhere, we know that at first the apparatus strove to keep\r\nas free from excitement as possible, and in its first formation,\r\ntherefore, the scheme took the form of a reflex apparatus, which enabled\r\nit promptly to discharge through the motor tracts any sensible stimulus\r\nreaching it from without. But this simple function was disturbed by the\r\nwants of life, which likewise furnish the impulse for the further\r\ndevelopment of the apparatus. The wants of life first manifested\r\nthemselves to it in the form of the great physical needs. The excitement\r\naroused by the inner want seeks an outlet in motility, which may be\r\ndesignated as \xe2\x80\x9cinner changes\xe2\x80\x9d or as an \xe2\x80\x9cexpression of the emotions.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nhungry child cries or fidgets helplessly, but its situation remains\r\nunchanged; for the excitation proceeding from an inner want requires,\r\nnot a momentary outbreak, but a force working continuously. A change can\r\noccur only if in some way a feeling of gratification is\r\nexperienced\xe2\x80\x94which in the case of the child must be through outside\r\nhelp\xe2\x80\x94in order to remove the inner excitement. An essential constituent\r\nof this experience is the appearance of a certain perception (of food in\r\nour example), the memory picture of which thereafter remains associated\r\nwith the memory trace of the excitation of want.\r\n\r\nThanks to the established connection, there results at the next\r\nappearance of this want a psychic feeling which revives the memory\r\npicture of the former perception, and thus recalls the former perception\r\nitself, _i.e._ it actually re-establishes the situation of the first\r\ngratification. We call such a feeling a wish; the reappearance of the\r\nperception constitutes the wish-fulfilment, and the full revival of the\r\nperception by the want excitement constitutes the shortest road to the\r\nwish-fulfilment. We may assume a primitive condition of the psychic\r\napparatus in which this road is really followed, _i.e._ where the\r\nwishing merges into an hallucination. This first psychic activity\r\ntherefore aims at an identity of perception, _i.e._ it aims at a\r\nrepetition of that perception which is connected with the fulfilment of\r\nthe want.\r\n\r\nThis primitive mental activity must have been modified by bitter\r\npractical experience into a more expedient secondary activity. The\r\nestablishment of the identity perception on the short regressive road\r\nwithin the apparatus does not in another respect carry with it the\r\nresult which inevitably follows the revival of the same perception from\r\nwithout. The gratification does not take place, and the want continues.\r\nIn order to equalise the internal with the external sum of energy, the\r\nformer must be continually maintained, just as actually happens in the\r\nhallucinatory psychoses and in the deliriums of hunger which exhaust\r\ntheir psychic capacity in clinging to the object desired. In order to\r\nmake more appropriate use of the psychic force, it becomes necessary to\r\ninhibit the full regression so as to prevent it from extending beyond\r\nthe image of memory, whence it can select other paths leading ultimately\r\nto the establishment of the desired identity from the outer world. This\r\ninhibition and consequent deviation from the excitation becomes the task\r\nof a second system which dominates the voluntary motility, _i.e._\r\nthrough whose activity the expenditure of motility is now devoted to\r\npreviously recalled purposes. But this entire complicated mental\r\nactivity which works its way from the memory picture to the\r\nestablishment of the perception identity from the outer world merely\r\nrepresents a detour which has been forced upon the wish-fulfilment by\r\nexperience.[FS] Thinking is indeed nothing but the equivalent of the\r\nhallucinatory wish; and if the dream be called a wish-fulfilment this\r\nbecomes self-evident, as nothing but a wish can impel our psychic\r\napparatus to activity. The dream, which in fulfilling its wishes follows\r\nthe short regressive path, thereby preserves for us only an example of\r\nthe primary form of the psychic apparatus which has been abandoned as\r\ninexpedient. What once ruled in the waking state when the psychic life\r\nwas still young and unfit seems to have been banished into the sleeping\r\nstate, just as we see again in the nursery the bow and arrow, the\r\ndiscarded primitive weapons of grown-up humanity. _The dream is a\r\nfragment of the abandoned psychic life of the child._ In the psychoses\r\nthese modes of operation of the psychic apparatus, which are normally\r\nsuppressed in the waking state, reassert themselves, and then betray\r\ntheir inability to satisfy our wants in the outer world.\r\n\r\nThe unconscious wish-feelings evidently strive to assert themselves\r\nduring the day also, and the fact of transference and the psychoses\r\nteach us that they endeavour to penetrate to consciousness and dominate\r\nmotility by the road leading through the system of the foreconscious. It\r\nis, therefore, the censor lying between the Unc. and the Forec., the\r\nassumption of which is forced upon us by the dream, that we have to\r\nrecognise and honour as the guardian of our psychic health. But is it\r\nnot carelessness on the part of this guardian to diminish its vigilance\r\nduring the night and to allow the suppressed emotions of the Unc. to\r\ncome to expression, thus again making possible the hallucinatory\r\nregression? I think not, for when the critical guardian goes to rest\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwe have proof that his slumber is not profound\xe2\x80\x94he takes care to close\r\nthe gate to motility. No matter what feelings from the otherwise\r\ninhibited Unc. may roam about on the scene, they need not be interfered\r\nwith; they remain harmless because they are unable to put in motion the\r\nmotor apparatus which alone can exert a modifying influence upon the\r\nouter world. Sleep guarantees the security of the fortress which is\r\nunder guard. Conditions are less harmless when a displacement of forces\r\nis produced, not through a nocturnal diminution in the operation of the\r\ncritical censor, but through pathological enfeeblement of the latter or\r\nthrough pathological reinforcement of the unconscious excitations, and\r\nthis while the foreconscious is charged with energy and the avenues to\r\nmotility are open. The guardian is then overpowered, the unconscious\r\nexcitations subdue the Forec.; through it they dominate our speech and\r\nactions, or they enforce the hallucinatory regression, thus governing an\r\napparatus not designed for them by virtue of the attraction exerted by\r\nthe perceptions on the distribution of our psychic energy. We call this\r\ncondition a psychosis.\r\n\r\nWe are now in the best position to complete our psychological\r\nconstruction, which has been interrupted by the introduction of the two\r\nsystems, Unc. and Forec. We have still, however, ample reason for giving\r\nfurther consideration to the wish as the sole psychic motive power in\r\nthe dream. We have explained that the reason why the dream is in every\r\ncase a wish realisation is because it is a product of the Unc., which\r\nknows no other aim in its activity but the fulfilment of wishes, and\r\nwhich has no other forces at its disposal but wish-feelings. If we avail\r\nourselves for a moment longer of the right to elaborate from the dream\r\ninterpretation such far-reaching psychological speculations, we are in\r\nduty bound to demonstrate that we are thereby bringing the dream into a\r\nrelationship which may also comprise other psychic structures. If there\r\nexists a system of the Unc.\xe2\x80\x94or something sufficiently analogous to it\r\nfor the purpose of our discussion\xe2\x80\x94the dream cannot be its sole\r\nmanifestation; every dream may be a wish-fulfilment, but there must be\r\nother forms of abnormal wish-fulfilment besides this of dreams. Indeed,\r\nthe theory of all psychoneurotic symptoms culminates in the proposition\r\n_that they too must be taken as wish-fulfilments of the unconscious_.\r\nOur explanation makes the dream only the first member of a group most\r\nimportant for the psychiatrist, an understanding of which means the\r\nsolution of the purely psychological part of the psychiatric problem.\r\nBut other members of this group of wish-fulfilments, _e.g._, the\r\nhysterical symptoms, evince one essential quality which I have so far\r\nfailed to find in the dream. Thus, from the investigations frequently\r\nreferred to in this treatise, I know that the formation of an hysterical\r\nsymptom necessitates the combination of both streams of our psychic\r\nlife. The symptom is not merely the expression of a realised unconscious\r\nwish, but it must be joined by another wish from the foreconscious which\r\nis fulfilled by the same symptom; so that the symptom is at least doubly\r\ndetermined, once by each one of the conflicting systems. Just as in the\r\ndream, there is no limit to further over-determination. The\r\ndetermination not derived from the Unc. is, as far as I can see,\r\ninvariably a stream of thought in reaction against the unconscious wish,\r\n_e.g._, a self-punishment. Hence I may say, in general, that _an\r\nhysterical symptom originates only where two contrasting\r\nwish-fulfilments, having their source in different psychic systems, are\r\nable to combine in one expression_. (Compare my latest formulation of\r\nthe origin of the hysterical symptoms in a treatise published by the\r\n_Zeitschrift f\xc3\xbcr Sexualwissenschaft_, by Hirschfeld and others, 1908).\r\nExamples on this point would prove of little value, as nothing but a\r\ncomplete unveiling of the complication in question would carry\r\nconviction. I therefore content myself with the mere assertion, and will\r\ncite an example, not for conviction but for explication. The hysterical\r\nvomiting of a female patient proved, on the one hand, to be the\r\nrealisation of an unconscious fancy from the time of puberty, that she\r\nmight be continuously pregnant and have a multitude of children, and\r\nthis was subsequently united with the wish that she might have them from\r\nas many men as possible. Against this immoderate wish there arose a\r\npowerful defensive impulse. But as the vomiting might spoil the\r\npatient\xe2\x80\x99s figure and beauty, so that she would not find favour in the\r\neyes of mankind, the symptom was therefore in keeping with her punitive\r\ntrend of thought, and, being thus admissible from both sides, it was\r\nallowed to become a reality. This is the same manner of consenting to a\r\nwish-fulfilment which the queen of the Parthians chose for the triumvir\r\nCrassus. Believing that he had undertaken the campaign out of greed for\r\ngold, she caused molten gold to be poured into the throat of the corpse.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow hast thou what thou hast longed for.\xe2\x80\x9d As yet we know of the dream\r\nonly that it expresses a wish-fulfilment of the unconscious; and\r\napparently the dominating foreconscious permits this only after it has\r\nsubjected the wish to some distortions. We are really in no position to\r\ndemonstrate regularly a stream of thought antagonistic to the dream-wish\r\nwhich is realised in the dream as in its counterpart. Only now and then\r\nhave we found in the dream traces of reaction formations, as, for\r\ninstance, the tenderness toward friend R. in the \xe2\x80\x9cuncle dream\xe2\x80\x9d (p. 116).\r\nBut the contribution from the foreconscious, which is missing here, may\r\nbe found in another place. While the dominating system has withdrawn on\r\nthe wish to sleep, the dream may bring to expression with manifold\r\ndistortions a wish from the Unc., and realise this wish by producing the\r\nnecessary changes of energy in the psychic apparatus, and may finally\r\nretain it through the entire duration of sleep.[FT]\r\n\r\nThis persistent wish to sleep on the part of the foreconscious in\r\ngeneral facilitates the formation of the dream. Let us refer to the\r\ndream of the father who, by the gleam of light from the death chamber,\r\nwas brought to the conclusion that the body has been set on fire. We\r\nhave shown that one of the psychic forces decisive in causing the father\r\nto form this conclusion, instead of being awakened by the gleam of\r\nlight, was the wish to prolong the life of the child seen in the dream\r\nby one moment. Other wishes proceeding from the repression probably\r\nescape us, because we are unable to analyse this dream. But as a second\r\nmotive power of the dream we may mention the father\xe2\x80\x99s desire to sleep,\r\nfor, like the life of the child, the sleep of the father is prolonged\r\nfor a moment by the dream. The underlying motive is: \xe2\x80\x9cLet the dream go\r\non, otherwise I must wake up.\xe2\x80\x9d As in this dream so also in all other\r\ndreams, the wish to sleep lends its support to the unconscious wish. On\r\npage 104 we reported dreams which were apparently dreams of convenience.\r\nBut, properly speaking, all dreams may claim this designation. The\r\nefficacy of the wish to continue to sleep is the most easily recognised\r\nin the waking dreams, which so transform the objective sensory stimulus\r\nas to render it compatible with the continuance of sleep; they\r\ninterweave this stimulus with the dream in order to rob it of any claims\r\nit might make as a warning to the outer world. But this wish to continue\r\nto sleep must also participate in the formation of all other dreams\r\nwhich may disturb the sleeping state from within only. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, sleep\r\non; why, it\xe2\x80\x99s but a dream\xe2\x80\x9d; this is in many cases the suggestion of the\r\nForec. to consciousness when the dream goes too far; and this also\r\ndescribes in a general way the attitude of our dominating psychic\r\nactivity toward dreaming, though the thought remains tacit. I must draw\r\nthe conclusion that _throughout our entire sleeping state we are just as\r\ncertain that we are dreaming as we are certain that we are sleeping_. We\r\nare compelled to disregard the objection urged against this conclusion\r\nthat our consciousness is never directed to a knowledge of the former,\r\nand that it is directed to a knowledge of the latter only on special\r\noccasions when the censor is unexpectedly surprised. Against this\r\nobjection we may say that there are persons who are entirely conscious\r\nof their sleeping and dreaming, and who are apparently endowed with the\r\nconscious faculty of guiding their dream life. Such a dreamer, when\r\ndissatisfied with the course taken by the dream, breaks it off without\r\nawakening, and begins it anew in order to continue it with a different\r\nturn, like the popular author who, on request, gives a happier ending to\r\nhis play. Or, at another time, if placed by the dream in a sexually\r\nexciting situation, he thinks in his sleep: \xe2\x80\x9cI do not care to continue\r\nthis dream and exhaust myself by a pollution; I prefer to defer it in\r\nfavour of a real situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Waking caused by the Dream\xe2\x80\x94The Function of the Dream\xe2\x80\x94The Anxiety\r\n                                Dream._\r\n\r\nSince we know that the foreconscious is suspended during the night by\r\nthe wish to sleep, we can proceed to an intelligent investigation of the\r\ndream process. But let us first sum up the knowledge of this process\r\nalready gained. We have shown that the waking activity leaves day\r\nremnants from which the sum of energy cannot be entirely removed; or the\r\nwaking activity revives during the day one of the unconscious wishes; or\r\nboth conditions occur simultaneously; we have already discovered the\r\nmany variations that may take place. The unconscious wish has already\r\nmade its way to the day remnants, either during the day or at any rate\r\nwith the beginning of sleep, and has effected a transference to it. This\r\nproduces a wish transferred to the recent material, or the suppressed\r\nrecent wish comes to life again through a reinforcement from the\r\nunconscious. This wish now endeavours to make its way to consciousness\r\non the normal path of the mental processes through the foreconscious, to\r\nwhich indeed it belongs through one of its constituent elements. It is\r\nconfronted, however, by the censor, which is still active, and to the\r\ninfluence of which it now succumbs. It now takes on the distortion for\r\nwhich the way has already been paved by its transference to the recent\r\nmaterial. Thus far it is in the way of becoming something resembling an\r\nobsession, delusion, or the like, _i.e._ a thought reinforced by a\r\ntransference and distorted in expression by the censor. But its further\r\nprogress is now checked through the dormant state of the foreconscious;\r\nthis system has apparently protected itself against invasion by\r\ndiminishing its excitements. The dream process, therefore, takes the\r\nregressive course, which has just been opened by the peculiarity of the\r\nsleeping state, and thereby follows the attraction exerted on it by the\r\nmemory groups, which themselves exist in part only as visual energy not\r\nyet translated into terms of the later systems. On its way to regression\r\nthe dream takes on the form of dramatisation. The subject of compression\r\nwill be discussed later. The dream process has now terminated the second\r\npart of its repeatedly impeded course. The first part expended itself\r\nprogressively from the unconscious scenes or phantasies to the\r\nforeconscious, while the second part gravitates from the advent of the\r\ncensor back to the perceptions. But when the dream process becomes a\r\ncontent of perception it has, so to speak, eluded the obstacle set up in\r\nthe Forec. by the censor and by the sleeping state. It succeeds in\r\ndrawing attention to itself and in being noticed by consciousness. For\r\nconsciousness, which means to us a sensory organ for the reception of\r\npsychic qualities, may receive stimuli from two sources\xe2\x80\x94first, from the\r\nperiphery of the entire apparatus, viz. from the perception system, and,\r\nsecondly, from the pleasure and pain stimuli, which constitute the sole\r\npsychic quality produced in the transformation of energy within the\r\napparatus. All other processes in the \xce\xa8-system, even those in the\r\nforeconscious, are devoid of any psychic quality, and are therefore not\r\nobjects of consciousness inasmuch as they do not furnish pleasure or\r\npain for perception. We shall have to assume that those liberations of\r\npleasure and pain automatically regulate the outlet of the occupation\r\nprocesses. But in order to make possible more delicate functions, it was\r\nlater found necessary to render the course of the presentations more\r\nindependent of the manifestations of pain. To accomplish this the Forec.\r\nsystem needed some qualities of its own which could attract\r\nconsciousness, and most probably received them through the connection of\r\nthe foreconscious processes with the memory system of the signs of\r\nspeech, which is not devoid of qualities. Through the qualities of this\r\nsystem, consciousness, which had hitherto been a sensory organ only for\r\nthe perceptions, now becomes also a sensory organ for a part of our\r\nmental processes. Thus we have now, as it were, two sensory surfaces,\r\none directed to perceptions and the other to the foreconscious mental\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nI must assume that the sensory surface of consciousness devoted to the\r\nForec. is rendered less excitable by sleep than that directed to the\r\nP-systems. The giving up of interest for the nocturnal mental processes\r\nis indeed purposeful. Nothing is to disturb the mind; the Forec. wants\r\nto sleep. But once the dream becomes a perception, it is then capable of\r\nexciting consciousness through the qualities thus gained. The sensory\r\nstimulus accomplishes what it was really destined for, namely, it\r\ndirects a part of the energy at the disposal of the Forec. in the form\r\nof attention upon the stimulant. We must, therefore, admit that the\r\ndream invariably awakens us, that is, it puts into activity a part of\r\nthe dormant force of the Forec. This force imparts to the dream that\r\ninfluence which we have designated as secondary elaboration for the sake\r\nof connection and comprehensibility. This means that the dream is\r\ntreated by it like any other content of perception; it is subjected to\r\nthe same ideas of expectation, as far at least as the material admits.\r\nAs far as the direction is concerned in this third part of the dream, it\r\nmay be said that here again the movement is progressive.\r\n\r\nTo avoid misunderstanding, it will not be amiss to say a few words about\r\nthe temporal peculiarities of these dream processes. In a very\r\ninteresting discussion, apparently suggested by Maury\xe2\x80\x99s puzzling\r\nguillotine dream, Goblot[29] tries to demonstrate that the dream\r\nrequires no other time than the transition period between sleeping and\r\nawakening. The awakening requires time, as the dream takes place during\r\nthat period. One is inclined to believe that the final picture of the\r\ndream is so strong that it forces the dreamer to awaken; but, as a\r\nmatter of fact, this picture is strong only because the dreamer is\r\nalready very near awakening when it appears. \xe2\x80\x9cUn r\xc3\xaave c\xe2\x80\x99est un r\xc3\xa9veil\r\nqui commence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt has already been emphasized by Dugas[18] that Goblot was forced to\r\nrepudiate many facts in order to generalise his theory. There are,\r\nmoreover, dreams from which we do not awaken, _e.g._, some dreams in\r\nwhich we dream that we dream. From our knowledge of the dream-work, we\r\ncan by no means admit that it extends only over the period of awakening.\r\nOn the contrary, we must consider it probable that the first part of the\r\ndream-work begins during the day when we are still under the domination\r\nof the foreconscious. The second phase of the dream-work, viz. the\r\nmodification through the censor, the attraction by the unconscious\r\nscenes, and the penetration to perception must continue throughout the\r\nnight. And we are probably always right when we assert that we feel as\r\nthough we had been dreaming the whole night, although we cannot say\r\nwhat. I do not, however, think it necessary to assume that, up to the\r\ntime of becoming conscious, the dream processes really follow the\r\ntemporal sequence which we have described, viz. that there is first the\r\ntransferred dream-wish, then the distortion of the censor, and\r\nconsequently the change of direction to regression, and so on. We were\r\nforced to form such a succession for the sake of _description_; in\r\nreality, however, it is much rather a matter of simultaneously trying\r\nthis path and that, and of emotions fluctuating to and fro, until\r\nfinally, owing to the most expedient distribution, one particular\r\ngrouping is secured which remains. From certain personal experiences, I\r\nam myself inclined to believe that the dream-work often requires more\r\nthan one day and one night to produce its result; if this be true, the\r\nextraordinary art manifested in the construction of the dream loses all\r\nits marvels. In my opinion, even the regard for comprehensibility as an\r\noccurrence of perception may take effect before the dream attracts\r\nconsciousness to itself. To be sure, from now on the process is\r\naccelerated, as the dream is henceforth subjected to the same treatment\r\nas any other perception. It is like fireworks, which require hours of\r\npreparation and only a moment for ignition.\r\n\r\nThrough the dream-work the dream process now gains either sufficient\r\nintensity to attract consciousness to itself and arouse the\r\nforeconscious, which is quite independent of the time or profundity of\r\nsleep, or, its intensity being insufficient it must wait until it meets\r\nthe attention which is set in motion immediately before awakening. Most\r\ndreams seem to operate with relatively slight psychic intensities, for\r\nthey wait for the awakening. This, however, explains the fact that we\r\nregularly perceive something dreamt on being suddenly aroused from a\r\nsound sleep. Here, as well as in spontaneous awakening, the first glance\r\nstrikes the perception content created by the dream-work, while the next\r\nstrikes the one produced from without.\r\n\r\nBut of greater theoretical interest are those dreams which are capable\r\nof waking us in the midst of sleep. We must bear in mind the expediency\r\nelsewhere universally demonstrated, and ask ourselves why the dream or\r\nthe unconscious wish has the power to disturb sleep, _i.e._ the\r\nfulfilment of the foreconscious wish. This is probably due to certain\r\nrelations of energy into which we have no insight. If we possessed such\r\ninsight we should probably find that the freedom given to the dream and\r\nthe expenditure of a certain amount of detached attention represent for\r\nthe dream an economy in energy, keeping in view the fact that the\r\nunconscious must be held in check at night just as during the day. We\r\nknow from experience that the dream, even if it interrupts sleep,\r\nrepeatedly during the same night, still remains compatible with sleep.\r\nWe wake up for an instant, and immediately resume our sleep. It is like\r\ndriving off a fly during sleep, we awake _ad hoc_, and when we resume\r\nour sleep we have removed the disturbance. As demonstrated by familiar\r\nexamples from the sleep of wet nurses, &c., the fulfilment of the wish\r\nto sleep is quite compatible with the retention of a certain amount of\r\nattention in a given direction.\r\n\r\nBut we must here take cognisance of an objection that is based on a\r\nbetter knowledge of the unconscious processes. Although we have\r\nourselves described the unconscious wishes as always active, we have,\r\nnevertheless, asserted that they are not sufficiently strong during the\r\nday to make themselves perceptible. But when we sleep, and the\r\nunconscious wish has shown its power to form a dream, and with it to\r\nawaken the foreconscious, why, then, does this power become exhausted\r\nafter the dream has been taken cognisance of? Would it not seem more\r\nprobable that the dream should continually renew itself, like the\r\ntroublesome fly which, when driven away, takes pleasure in returning\r\nagain and again? What justifies our assertion that the dream removes the\r\ndisturbance of sleep?\r\n\r\nThat the unconscious wishes always remain active is quite true. They\r\nrepresent paths which are passable whenever a sum of excitement makes\r\nuse of them. Moreover, a remarkable peculiarity of the unconscious\r\nprocesses is the fact that they remain indestructible. Nothing can be\r\nbrought to an end in the unconscious; nothing can cease or be forgotten.\r\nThis impression is most strongly gained in the study of the neuroses,\r\nespecially of hysteria. The unconscious stream of thought which leads to\r\nthe discharge through an attack becomes passable again as soon as there\r\nis an accumulation of a sufficient amount of excitement. The\r\nmortification brought on thirty years ago, after having gained access to\r\nthe unconscious affective source, operates during all these thirty years\r\nlike a recent one. Whenever its memory is touched, it is revived and\r\nshows itself to be supplied with the excitement which is discharged in a\r\nmotor attack. It is just here that the office of psychotherapy begins,\r\nits task being to bring about adjustment and forgetfulness for the\r\nunconscious processes. Indeed, the fading of memories and the flagging\r\nof affects, which we are apt to take as self-evident and to explain as a\r\nprimary influence of time on the psychic memories, are in reality\r\nsecondary changes brought about by painstaking work. It is the\r\nforeconscious that accomplishes this work; and the only course to be\r\npursued by psychotherapy is to subjugate the Unc. to the domination of\r\nthe Forec.\r\n\r\nThere are, therefore, two exits for the individual unconscious emotional\r\nprocess. It is either left to itself, in which case it ultimately breaks\r\nthrough somewhere and secures for once a discharge for its excitation\r\ninto motility; or it succumbs to the influence of the foreconscious, and\r\nits excitation becomes confined through this influence instead of being\r\ndischarged. It is the latter process that occurs in the dream. Owing to\r\nthe fact that it is directed by the conscious excitement, the energy\r\nfrom the Forec., which confronts the dream when grown to perception,\r\nrestricts the unconscious excitement of the dream and renders it\r\nharmless as a disturbing factor. When the dreamer wakes up for a moment,\r\nhe has actually chased away the fly that has threatened to disturb his\r\nsleep. We can now understand that it is really more expedient and\r\neconomical to give full sway to the unconscious wish, and clear its way\r\nto regression so that it may form a dream, and then restrict and adjust\r\nthis dream by means of a small expenditure of foreconscious labour, than\r\nto curb the unconscious throughout the entire period of sleep. We\r\nshould, indeed, expect that the dream, even if it was not originally an\r\nexpedient process, would have acquired some function in the play of\r\nforces of the psychic life. We now see what this function is. The dream\r\nhas taken it upon itself to bring the liberated excitement of the Unc.\r\nback under the domination of the foreconscious; it thus affords relief\r\nfor the excitement of the Unc. and acts as a safety-valve for the\r\nlatter, and at the same time it insures the sleep of the foreconscious\r\nat a slight expenditure of the waking state. Like the other psychic\r\nformations of its group, the dream offers itself as a compromise serving\r\nsimultaneously both systems by fulfilling both wishes in so far as they\r\nare compatible with each other. A glance at Robert\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9celimination\r\ntheory,\xe2\x80\x9d referred to on page 66, will show that we must agree with this\r\nauthor in his main point, viz. in the determination of the function of\r\nthe dream, though we differ from him in our hypotheses and in our\r\ntreatment of the dream process.\r\n\r\nThe above qualification\xe2\x80\x94in so far as the two wishes are compatible with\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x94contains a suggestion that there may be cases in which the\r\nfunction of the dream suffers shipwreck. The dream process is in the\r\nfirst instance admitted as a wish-fulfilment of the unconscious, but if\r\nthis tentative wish-fulfilment disturbs the foreconscious to such an\r\nextent that the latter can no longer maintain its rest, the dream then\r\nbreaks the compromise and fails to perform the second part of its task.\r\nIt is then at once broken off, and replaced by complete wakefulness.\r\nHere, too, it is not really the fault of the dream, if, while ordinarily\r\nthe guardian of sleep, it is here compelled to appear as the disturber\r\nof sleep, nor should this cause us to entertain any doubts as to its\r\nefficacy. This is not the only case in the organism in which an\r\notherwise efficacious arrangement became inefficacious and disturbing as\r\nsoon as some element is changed in the conditions of its origin; the\r\ndisturbance then serves at least the new purpose of announcing the\r\nchange, and calling into play against it the means of adjustment of the\r\norganism. In this connection, I naturally bear in mind the case of the\r\nanxiety dream, and in order not to have the appearance of trying to\r\nexclude this testimony against the theory of wish-fulfilment wherever I\r\nencounter it, I will attempt an explanation of the anxiety dream, at\r\nleast offering some suggestions.\r\n\r\nThat a psychic process developing anxiety may still be a wish-fulfilment\r\nhas long ceased to impress us as a contradiction. We may explain this\r\noccurrence by the fact that the wish belongs to one system (the Unc.),\r\nwhile by the other system (the Forec.), this wish has been rejected and\r\nsuppressed. The subjection of the Unc. by the Forec. is not complete\r\neven in perfect psychic health; the amount of this suppression shows the\r\ndegree of our psychic normality. Neurotic symptoms show that there is a\r\nconflict between the two systems; the symptoms are the results of a\r\ncompromise of this conflict, and they temporarily put an end to it. On\r\nthe one hand, they afford the Unc. an outlet for the discharge of its\r\nexcitement, and serve it as a sally port, while, on the other hand, they\r\ngive the Forec. the capability of dominating the Unc. to some extent. It\r\nis highly instructive to consider, _e.g._, the significance of any\r\nhysterical phobia or of an agoraphobia. Suppose a neurotic incapable of\r\ncrossing the street alone, which we would justly call a \xe2\x80\x9csymptom.\xe2\x80\x9d We\r\nattempt to remove this symptom by urging him to the action which he\r\ndeems himself incapable of. The result will be an attack of anxiety,\r\njust as an attack of anxiety in the street has often been the cause of\r\nestablishing an agoraphobia. We thus learn that the symptom has been\r\nconstituted in order to guard against the outbreak of the anxiety. The\r\nphobia is thrown before the anxiety like a fortress on the frontier.\r\n\r\nUnless we enter into the part played by the affects in these processes,\r\nwhich can be done here only imperfectly, we cannot continue our\r\ndiscussion. Let us therefore advance the proposition that the reason why\r\nthe suppression of the unconscious becomes absolutely necessary is\r\nbecause, if the discharge of presentation should be left to itself, it\r\nwould develop an affect in the Unc. which originally bore the character\r\nof pleasure, but which, since the appearance of the repression, bears\r\nthe character of pain. The aim, as well as the result, of the\r\nsuppression is to stop the development of this pain. The suppression\r\nextends over the unconscious ideation, because the liberation of pain\r\nmight emanate from the ideation. The foundation is here laid for a very\r\ndefinite assumption concerning the nature of the affective development.\r\nIt is regarded as a motor or secondary activity, the key to the\r\ninnervation of which is located in the presentations of the Unc. Through\r\nthe domination of the Forec. these presentations become, as it were,\r\nthrottled and inhibited at the exit of the emotion-developing impulses.\r\nThe danger, which is due to the fact that the Forec. ceases to occupy\r\nthe energy, therefore consists in the fact that the unconscious\r\nexcitations liberate such an affect as\xe2\x80\x94in consequence of the repression\r\nthat has previously taken place\xe2\x80\x94can only be perceived as pain or\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nThis danger is released through the full sway of the dream process. The\r\ndeterminations for its realisation consist in the fact that repressions\r\nhave taken place, and that the suppressed emotional wishes shall become\r\nsufficiently strong. They thus stand entirely without the psychological\r\nrealm of the dream structure. Were it not for the fact that our subject\r\nis connected through just one factor, namely, the freeing of the Unc.\r\nduring sleep, with the subject of the development of anxiety, I could\r\ndispense with discussion of the anxiety dream, and thus avoid all\r\nobscurities connected with it.\r\n\r\nAs I have often repeated, the theory of the anxiety belongs to the\r\npsychology of the neuroses. I would say that the anxiety in the dream is\r\nan anxiety problem and not a dream problem. We have nothing further to\r\ndo with it after having once demonstrated its point of contact with the\r\nsubject of the dream process. There is only one thing left for me to do.\r\nAs I have asserted that the neurotic anxiety originates from sexual\r\nsources, I can subject anxiety dreams to analysis in order to\r\ndemonstrate the sexual material in their dream thoughts.\r\n\r\nFor good reasons I refrain from citing here any of the numerous examples\r\nplaced at my disposal by neurotic patients, but prefer to give anxiety\r\ndreams from young persons.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have had no real anxiety dream for decades, but I recall\r\none from my seventh or eighth year which I subjected to interpretation\r\nabout thirty years later. The dream was very vivid, and showed me _my\r\nbeloved mother, with peculiarly calm sleeping countenance, carried into\r\nthe room and laid on the bed by two (or three) persons with bird\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeaks_. I awoke crying and screaming, and disturbed my parents. The very\r\ntall figures\xe2\x80\x94draped in a peculiar manner\xe2\x80\x94with beaks, I had taken from\r\nthe illustrations of Philippson\xe2\x80\x99s bible; I believe they represented\r\ndeities with heads of sparrowhawks from an Egyptian tomb relief. The\r\nanalysis also introduced the reminiscence of a naughty janitor\xe2\x80\x99s boy,\r\nwho used to play with us children on the meadow in front of the house; I\r\nwould add that his name was Philip. I feel that I first heard from this\r\nboy the vulgar word signifying sexual intercourse, which is replaced\r\namong the educated by the Latin \xe2\x80\x9ccoitus,\xe2\x80\x9d but to which the dream\r\ndistinctly alludes by the selection of the bird\xe2\x80\x99s heads.[FU] I must have\r\nsuspected the sexual significance of the word from the facial expression\r\nof my worldly-wise teacher. My mother\xe2\x80\x99s features in the dream were\r\ncopied from the countenance of my grandfather, whom I had seen a few\r\ndays before his death snoring in the state of coma. The interpretation\r\nof the secondary elaboration in the dream must therefore have been that\r\nmy mother was dying; the tomb relief, too, agrees with this. In this\r\nanxiety I awoke, and could not calm myself until I had awakened my\r\nparents. I remember that I suddenly became calm on coming face to face\r\nwith my mother, as if I needed the assurance that my mother was not\r\ndead. But this secondary interpretation of the dream had been effected\r\nonly under the influence of the developed anxiety. I was not frightened\r\nbecause I dreamed that my mother was dying, but I interpreted the dream\r\nin this manner in the foreconscious elaboration because I was already\r\nunder the domination of the anxiety. The latter, however, could be\r\ntraced by means of the repression to an obscure obviously sexual desire,\r\nwhich had found its satisfying expression in the visual content of the\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nA man twenty-seven years old who had been severely ill for a year had\r\nhad many terrifying dreams between the ages of eleven and thirteen. He\r\nthought that a man with an axe was running after him; he wished to run,\r\nbut felt paralysed and could not move from the spot. This may be taken\r\nas a good example of a very common, and apparently sexually indifferent,\r\nanxiety dream. In the analysis the dreamer first thought of a story told\r\nhim by his uncle, which chronologically was later than the dream, viz.\r\nthat he was attacked at night by a suspicious-looking individual. This\r\noccurrence led him to believe that he himself might have already heard\r\nof a similar episode at the time of the dream. In connection with the\r\naxe he recalled that during that period of his life he once hurt his\r\nhand with an axe while chopping wood. This immediately led to his\r\nrelations with his younger brother, whom he used to maltreat and knock\r\ndown. In particular, he recalled an occasion when he struck his brother\r\non the head with his boot until he bled, whereupon his mother remarked:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear he will kill him some day.\xe2\x80\x9d While he was seemingly thinking of\r\nthe subject of violence, a reminiscence from his ninth year suddenly\r\noccurred to him. His parents came home late and went to bed while he was\r\nfeigning sleep. He soon heard panting and other noises that appeared\r\nstrange to him, and he could also make out the position of his parents\r\nin bed. His further associations showed that he had established an\r\nanalogy between this relation between his parents and his own relation\r\ntoward his younger brother. He subsumed what occurred between his\r\nparents under the conception \xe2\x80\x9cviolence and wrestling,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus reached\r\na sadistic conception of the coitus act, as often happens among\r\nchildren. The fact that he often noticed blood on his mother\xe2\x80\x99s bed\r\ncorroborated his conception.\r\n\r\nThat the sexual intercourse of adults appears strange to children who\r\nobserve it, and arouses fear in them, I dare say is a fact of daily\r\nexperience. I have explained this fear by the fact that sexual\r\nexcitement is not mastered by their understanding, and is probably also\r\ninacceptable to them because their parents are involved in it. For the\r\nsame reason this excitement is converted into fear. At a still earlier\r\nperiod of life sexual emotion directed toward the parent of opposite sex\r\ndoes not meet with repression but finds free expression, as we have seen\r\nabove (pp. 209\xe2\x80\x93215).\r\n\r\nFor the night terrors with hallucinations (_pavor nocturnus_) frequently\r\nfound in children, I would unhesitatingly give the same explanation.\r\nHere, too, we are certainly dealing with the incomprehensible and\r\nrejected sexual feelings, which, if noted, would probably show a\r\ntemporal periodicity, for an enhancement of the sexual _libido_ may just\r\nas well be produced accidentally through emotional impressions as\r\nthrough the spontaneous and gradual processes of development.\r\n\r\nI lack the necessary material to sustain these explanations from\r\nobservation. On the other hand, the pediatrists seem to lack the point\r\nof view which alone makes comprehensible the whole series of phenomena,\r\non the somatic as well as on the psychic side. To illustrate by a\r\ncomical example how one wearing the blinders of medical mythology may\r\nmiss the understanding of such cases, I will relate a case which I found\r\nin a thesis on _pavor nocturnus_ by _Debacker_,[17] 1881 (p. 66). A\r\nthirteen-year-old boy of delicate health began to become anxious and\r\ndreamy; his sleep became restless, and about once a week it was\r\ninterrupted by an acute attack of anxiety with hallucinations. The\r\nmemory of these dreams was invariably very distinct. Thus, he related\r\nthat the _devil_ shouted at him: \xe2\x80\x9cNow we have you, now we have you,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthis was followed by an odour of sulphur; the fire burned his skin. This\r\ndream aroused him, terror-stricken. He was unable to scream at first;\r\nthen his voice returned, and he was heard to say distinctly: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\r\nnot me; why, I have done nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t, I shall never do\r\nit again.\xe2\x80\x9d Occasionally, also, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cAlbert has not done that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nLater he avoided undressing, because, as he said, the fire attacked him\r\nonly when he was undressed. From amid these evil dreams, which menaced\r\nhis health, he was sent into the country, where he recovered within a\r\nyear and a half, but at the age of fifteen he once confessed: \xe2\x80\x9cJe\r\nn\xe2\x80\x99osais pas l\xe2\x80\x99avouer, mais j\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9prouvais continuellement des picotements\r\net des surexcitations aux _parties_;[FV] \xc3\xa0 la fin, cela m\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9nervait tant\r\nque plusieurs fois, j\xe2\x80\x99ai pens\xc3\xa9 me jeter par la fen\xc3\xaatre au dortoir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is certainly not difficult to suspect: 1, that the boy had practised\r\nmasturbation in former years, that he probably denied it, and was\r\nthreatened with severe punishment for his wrongdoing (his confession: Je\r\nne le ferai plus; his denial: Albert n\xe2\x80\x99a jamais fait \xc3\xa7a). 2, That under\r\nthe pressure of puberty the temptation to self-abuse through the\r\ntickling of the genitals was reawakened. 3, That now, however, a\r\nstruggle of repression arose in him, suppressing the _libido_ and\r\nchanging it into fear, which subsequently took the form of the\r\npunishments with which he was then threatened.\r\n\r\nLet us, however, quote the conclusions drawn by our author (p. 69). This\r\nobservation shows: 1, That the influence of puberty may produce in a boy\r\nof delicate health a condition of extreme weakness, and that it may lead\r\nto a _very marked cerebral an\xc3\xa6mia_.[FW]\r\n\r\n2. This cerebral an\xc3\xa6mia produces a transformation of character,\r\ndemonomaniacal hallucinations, and very violent nocturnal, perhaps also\r\ndiurnal, states of anxiety.\r\n\r\n3. Demonomania and the self-reproaches of the day can be traced to the\r\ninfluences of religious education which the subject underwent as a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n4. All manifestations disappeared as a result of a lengthy sojourn in\r\nthe country, bodily exercise, and the return of physical strength after\r\nthe termination of the period of puberty.\r\n\r\n5. A predisposing influence for the origin of the cerebral condition of\r\nthe boy may be attributed to heredity and to the father\xe2\x80\x99s chronic\r\nsyphilitic state.\r\n\r\nThe concluding remarks of the author read: \xe2\x80\x9cNous avons fait entrer cette\r\nobservation dans le cadre des d\xc3\xa9lires apyr\xc3\xa9tiques d\xe2\x80\x99inanition, car c\xe2\x80\x99est\r\n\xc3\xa0 l\xe2\x80\x99isch\xc3\xa9mie c\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9brale que nous rattachons cet \xc3\xa9tat particulier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n        (_e_) _The Primary and Secondary Processes\xe2\x80\x94Regression._\r\n\r\nIn venturing to attempt to penetrate more deeply into the psychology of\r\nthe dream processes, I have undertaken a difficult task, to which,\r\nindeed, my power of description is hardly equal. To reproduce in\r\ndescription by a succession of words the simultaneousness of so complex\r\na chain of events, and in doing so to appear unbiassed throughout the\r\nexposition, goes fairly beyond my powers. I have now to atone for the\r\nfact that I have been unable in my description of the dream psychology\r\nto follow the historic development of my views. The view-points for my\r\nconception of the dream were reached through earlier investigations in\r\nthe psychology of the neuroses, to which I am not supposed to refer\r\nhere, but to which I am repeatedly forced to refer, whereas I should\r\nprefer to proceed in the opposite direction, and, starting from the\r\ndream, to establish a connection with the psychology of the neuroses. I\r\nam well aware of all the inconveniences arising for the reader from this\r\ndifficulty, but I know of no way to avoid them.\r\n\r\nAs I am dissatisfied with this state of affairs, I am glad to dwell upon\r\nanother viewpoint which seems to raise the value of my efforts. As has\r\nbeen shown in the introduction to the first chapter, I found myself\r\nconfronted with a theme which had been marked by the sharpest\r\ncontradictions on the part of the authorities. After our elaboration of\r\nthe dream problems we found room for most of these contradictions. We\r\nhave been forced, however, to take decided exception to two of the views\r\npronounced, viz. that the dream is a senseless and that it is a somatic\r\nprocess; apart from these cases we have had to accept all the\r\ncontradictory views in one place or another of the complicated argument,\r\nand we have been able to demonstrate that they had discovered something\r\nthat was correct. That the dream continues the impulses and interests of\r\nthe waking state has been quite generally confirmed through the\r\ndiscovery of the latent thoughts of the dream. These thoughts concern\r\nthemselves only with things that seem important and of momentous\r\ninterest to us. The dream never occupies itself with trifles. But we\r\nhave also concurred with the contrary view, viz. that the dream gathers\r\nup the indifferent remnants from the day, and that not until it has in\r\nsome measure withdrawn itself from the waking activity can an important\r\nevent of the day be taken up by the dream. We found this holding true\r\nfor the dream content, which gives the dream thought its changed\r\nexpression by means of disfigurement. We have said that from the nature\r\nof the association mechanism the dream process more easily takes\r\npossession of recent or indifferent material which has not yet been\r\nseized by the waking mental activity; and by reason of the censor it\r\ntransfers the psychic intensity from the important but also disagreeable\r\nto the indifferent material. The hypermnesia of the dream and the resort\r\nto infantile material have become main supports in our theory. In our\r\ntheory of the dream we have attributed to the wish originating from the\r\ninfantile the part of an indispensable motor for the formation of the\r\ndream. We naturally could not think of doubting the experimentally\r\ndemonstrated significance of the objective sensory stimuli during sleep;\r\nbut we have brought this material into the same relation to the\r\ndream-wish as the thought remnants from the waking activity. There was\r\nno need of disputing the fact that the dream interprets the objective\r\nsensory stimuli after the manner of an illusion; but we have supplied\r\nthe motive for this interpretation which has been left undecided by the\r\nauthorities. The interpretation follows in such a manner that the\r\nperceived object is rendered harmless as a sleep disturber and becomes\r\navailable for the wish-fulfilment. Though we do not admit as special\r\nsources of the dream the subjective state of excitement of the sensory\r\norgans during sleep, which seems to have been demonstrated by Trumbull\r\nLadd,[40] we are nevertheless able to explain this excitement through\r\nthe regressive revival of active memories behind the dream. A modest\r\npart in our conception has also been assigned to the inner organic\r\nsensations which are wont to be taken as the cardinal point in the\r\nexplanation of the dream. These\xe2\x80\x94the sensation of falling, flying, or\r\ninhibition\xe2\x80\x94stand as an ever ready material to be used by the dream-work\r\nto express the dream thought as often as need arises.\r\n\r\nThat the dream process is a rapid and momentary one seems to be true for\r\nthe perception through consciousness of the already prepared dream\r\ncontent; the preceding parts of the dream process probably take a slow,\r\nfluctuating course. We have solved the riddle of the superabundant dream\r\ncontent compressed within the briefest moment by explaining that this is\r\ndue to the appropriation of almost fully formed structures from the\r\npsychic life. That the dream is disfigured and distorted by memory we\r\nfound to be correct, but not troublesome, as this is only the last\r\nmanifest operation in the work of disfigurement which has been active\r\nfrom the beginning of the dream-work. In the bitter and seemingly\r\nirreconcilable controversy as to whether the psychic life sleeps at\r\nnight or can make the same use of all its capabilities as during the\r\nday, we have been able to agree with both sides, though not fully with\r\neither. We have found proof that the dream thoughts represent a most\r\ncomplicated intellectual activity, employing almost every means\r\nfurnished by the psychic apparatus; still it cannot be denied that these\r\ndream thoughts have originated during the day, and it is indispensable\r\nto assume that there is a sleeping state of the psychic life. Thus, even\r\nthe theory of partial sleep has come into play; but the characteristics\r\nof the sleeping state have been found not in the dilapidation of the\r\npsychic connections but in the cessation of the psychic system\r\ndominating the day, arising from its desire to sleep. The withdrawal\r\nfrom the outer world retains its significance also for our conception;\r\nthough not the only factor, it nevertheless helps the regression to make\r\npossible the representation of the dream. That we should reject the\r\nvoluntary guidance of the presentation course is uncontestable; but the\r\npsychic life does not thereby become aimless, for we have seen that\r\nafter the abandonment of the desired end-presentation undesired ones\r\ngain the mastery. The loose associative connection in the dream we have\r\nnot only recognised, but we have placed under its control a far greater\r\nterritory than could have been supposed; we have, however, found it\r\nmerely the feigned substitute for another correct and senseful one. To\r\nbe sure we, too, have called the dream absurd; but we have been able to\r\nlearn from examples how wise the dream really is when it simulates\r\nabsurdity. We do not deny any of the functions that have been attributed\r\nto the dream. That the dream relieves the mind like a valve, and that,\r\naccording to Robert\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, all kinds of harmful material are\r\nrendered harmless through representation in the dream, not only exactly\r\ncoincides with our theory of the two-fold wish-fulfilment in the dream,\r\nbut, in his own wording, becomes even more comprehensible for us than\r\nfor Robert himself. The free indulgence of the psychic in the play of\r\nits faculties finds expression with us in the non-interference with the\r\ndream on the part of the foreconscious activity. The \xe2\x80\x9creturn to the\r\nembryonal state of psychic life in the dream\xe2\x80\x9d and the observation of\r\nHavelock Ellis,[23] \xe2\x80\x9can archaic world of vast emotions and imperfect\r\nthoughts,\xe2\x80\x9d appear to us as happy anticipations of our deductions to the\r\neffect that _primitive_ modes of work suppressed during the day\r\nparticipate in the formation of the dream; and with us, as with\r\nDelage,[15] the _suppressed_ material becomes the mainspring of the\r\ndreaming.\r\n\r\nWe have fully recognised the r\xc3\xb4le which Scherner ascribes to the dream\r\nphantasy, and even his interpretation; but we have been obliged, so to\r\nspeak, to conduct them to another department in the problem. It is not\r\nthe dream that produces the phantasy but the unconscious phantasy that\r\ntakes the greatest part in the formation of the dream thoughts. We are\r\nindebted to Scherner for his clue to the source of the dream thoughts,\r\nbut almost everything that he ascribes to the dream-work is attributable\r\nto the activity of the unconscious, which is at work during the day, and\r\nwhich supplies incitements not only for dreams but for neurotic symptoms\r\nas well. We have had to separate the dream-work from this activity as\r\nbeing something entirely different and far more restricted. Finally, we\r\nhave by no means abandoned the relation of the dream to mental\r\ndisturbances, but, on the contrary, we have given it a more solid\r\nfoundation on new ground.\r\n\r\nThus held together by the new material of our theory as by a superior\r\nunity, we find the most varied and most contradictory conclusions of the\r\nauthorities fitting into our structure; some of them are differently\r\ndisposed, only a few of them are entirely rejected. But our own\r\nstructure is still unfinished. For, disregarding the many obscurities\r\nwhich we have necessarily encountered in our advance into the darkness\r\nof psychology, we are now apparently embarrassed by a new contradiction.\r\nOn the one hand, we have allowed the dream thoughts to proceed from\r\nperfectly normal mental operations, while, on the other hand, we have\r\nfound among the dream thoughts a number of entirely abnormal mental\r\nprocesses which extend likewise to the dream contents. These,\r\nconsequently, we have repeated in the interpretation of the dream. All\r\nthat we have termed the \xe2\x80\x9cdream-work\xe2\x80\x9d seems so remote from the psychic\r\nprocesses recognised by us as correct, that the severest judgments of\r\nthe authors as to the low psychic activity of dreaming seem to us well\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\nPerhaps only through still further advance can enlightenment and\r\nimprovement be brought about. I shall pick out one of the constellations\r\nleading to the formation of dreams.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that the dream replaces a number of thoughts derived\r\nfrom daily life which are perfectly formed logically. We cannot\r\ntherefore doubt that these thoughts originate from our normal mental\r\nlife. All the qualities which we esteem in our mental operations, and\r\nwhich distinguish these as complicated activities of a high order, we\r\nfind repeated in the dream thoughts. There is, however, no need of\r\nassuming that this mental work is performed during sleep, as this would\r\nmaterially impair the conception of the psychic state of sleep we have\r\nhitherto adhered to. These thoughts may just as well have originated\r\nfrom the day, and, unnoticed by our consciousness from their inception,\r\nthey may have continued to develop until they stood complete at the\r\nonset of sleep. If we are to conclude anything from this state of\r\naffairs, it will at most prove _that the most complex mental operations\r\nare possible without the co-operation of consciousness_, which we have\r\nalready learned independently from every psychoanalysis of persons\r\nsuffering from hysteria or obsessions. These dream thoughts are in\r\nthemselves surely not incapable of consciousness; if they have not\r\nbecome conscious to us during the day, this may have various reasons.\r\nThe state of becoming conscious depends on the exercise of a certain\r\npsychic function, viz. attention, which seems to be extended only in a\r\ndefinite quantity, and which may have been withdrawn from the stream of\r\nthought in question by other aims. Another way in which such mental\r\nstreams are kept from consciousness is the following:\xe2\x80\x94Our conscious\r\nreflection teaches us that when exercising attention we pursue a\r\ndefinite course. But if that course leads us to an idea which does not\r\nhold its own with the critic, we discontinue and cease to apply our\r\nattention. Now, apparently, the stream of thought thus started and\r\nabandoned may spin on without regaining attention unless it reaches a\r\nspot of especially marked intensity which forces the return of\r\nattention. An initial rejection, perhaps consciously brought about by\r\nthe judgment on the ground of incorrectness or unfitness for the actual\r\npurpose of the mental act, may therefore account for the fact that a\r\nmental process continues until the onset of sleep unnoticed by\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nLet us recapitulate by saying that we call such a stream of thought a\r\nforeconscious one, that we believe it to be perfectly correct, and that\r\nit may just as well be a more neglected one or an interrupted and\r\nsuppressed one. Let us also state frankly in what manner we conceive\r\nthis presentation course. We believe that a certain sum of excitement,\r\nwhich we call occupation energy, is displaced from an end-presentation\r\nalong the association paths selected by that end-presentation. A\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cneglected\xe2\x80\x9d stream of thought has received no such occupation, and from\r\na \xe2\x80\x9csuppressed\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9crejected\xe2\x80\x9d one this occupation has been withdrawn;\r\nboth have thus been left to their own emotions. The end-stream of\r\nthought stocked with energy is under certain conditions able to draw to\r\nitself the attention of consciousness, through which means it then\r\nreceives a \xe2\x80\x9csurplus of energy.\xe2\x80\x9d We shall be obliged somewhat later to\r\nelucidate our assumption concerning the nature and activity of\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nA train of thought thus incited in the Forec. may either disappear\r\nspontaneously or continue. The former issue we conceive as follows: It\r\ndiffuses its energy through all the association paths emanating from it,\r\nand throws the entire chain of ideas into a state of excitement which,\r\nafter lasting for a while, subsides through the transformation of the\r\nexcitement requiring an outlet into dormant energy.[FX] If this first\r\nissue is brought about the process has no further significance for the\r\ndream formation. But other end-presentations are lurking in our\r\nforeconscious that originate from the sources of our unconscious and\r\nfrom the ever active wishes. These may take possession of the\r\nexcitations in the circle of thought thus left to itself, establish a\r\nconnection between it and the unconscious wish, and transfer to it the\r\nenergy inherent in the unconscious wish. Henceforth the neglected or\r\nsuppressed train of thought is in a position to maintain itself,\r\nalthough this reinforcement does not help it to gain access to\r\nconsciousness. We may say that the hitherto foreconscious train of\r\nthought has been drawn into the unconscious.\r\n\r\nOther constellations for the dream formation would result if the\r\nforeconscious train of thought had from the beginning been connected\r\nwith the unconscious wish, and for that reason met with rejection by the\r\ndominating end-occupation; or if an unconscious wish were made active\r\nfor other\xe2\x80\x94possibly somatic\xe2\x80\x94reasons and of its own accord sought a\r\ntransference to the psychic remnants not occupied by the Forec. All\r\nthree cases finally combine in one issue, so that there is established\r\nin the foreconscious a stream of thought which, having been abandoned by\r\nthe foreconscious occupation, receives occupation from the unconscious\r\nwish.\r\n\r\nThe stream of thought is henceforth subjected to a series of\r\ntransformations which we no longer recognise as normal psychic processes\r\nand which give us a surprising result, viz. a psychopathological\r\nformation. Let us emphasize and group the same.\r\n\r\n1. The intensities of the individual ideas become capable of discharge\r\nin their entirety, and, proceeding from one conception to the other,\r\nthey thus form single presentations endowed with marked intensity.\r\nThrough the repeated recurrence of this process the intensity of an\r\nentire train of ideas may ultimately be gathered in a single\r\npresentation element. This is the principle of _compression or\r\ncondensation_ with which we became acquainted in the chapter on \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nDream-Work.\xe2\x80\x9d It is condensation that is mainly responsible for the\r\nstrange impression of the dream, for we know of nothing analogous to it\r\nin the normal psychic life accessible to consciousness. We find here,\r\nalso, presentations which possess great psychic significance as\r\njunctions or as end-results of whole chains of thought; but this\r\nvalidity does not manifest itself in any character conspicuous enough\r\nfor internal perception; hence, what has been presented in it does not\r\nbecome in any way more intensive. In the process of condensation the\r\nentire psychic connection becomes transformed into the intensity of the\r\npresentation content. It is the same as in a book where we space or\r\nprint in heavy type any word upon which particular stress is laid for\r\nthe understanding of the text. In speech the same word would be\r\npronounced loudly and deliberately and with emphasis. The first\r\ncomparison leads us at once to an example taken from the chapter on \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nDream-Work\xe2\x80\x9d (trimethylamine in the dream of Irma\xe2\x80\x99s injection).\r\nHistorians of art call our attention to the fact that the most ancient\r\nhistorical sculptures follow a similar principle in expressing the rank\r\nof the persons represented by the size of the statue. The king is made\r\ntwo or three times as large as his retinue or the vanquished enemy. A\r\npiece of art, however, from the Roman period makes use of more subtle\r\nmeans to accomplish the same purpose. The figure of the emperor is\r\nplaced in the centre in a firmly erect posture; special care is bestowed\r\non the proper modelling of his figure; his enemies are seen cowering at\r\nhis feet; but he is no longer represented a giant among dwarfs. However,\r\nthe bowing of the subordinate to his superior in our own days is only an\r\necho of that ancient principle of representation.\r\n\r\nThe direction taken by the condensations of the dream is prescribed on\r\nthe one hand by the true foreconscious relations of the dream thoughts,\r\non the other hand by the attraction of the visual reminiscences in the\r\nunconscious. The success of the condensation work produces those\r\nintensities which are required for penetration into the perception\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\n2. Through this free transferability of the intensities,\r\nmoreover, and in the service of condensation, _intermediary\r\npresentations_\xe2\x80\x94compromises, as it were\xe2\x80\x94are formed (_cf._ the numerous\r\nexamples). This, likewise, is something unheard of in the normal\r\npresentation course, where it is above all a question of selection and\r\nretention of the \xe2\x80\x9cproper\xe2\x80\x9d presentation element. On the other hand,\r\ncomposite and compromise formations occur with extraordinary frequency\r\nwhen we are trying to find the linguistic expression for foreconscious\r\nthoughts; these are considered \xe2\x80\x9cslips of the tongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n3. The presentations which transfer their intensities to one another are\r\n_very loosely connected_, and are joined together by such forms of\r\nassociation as are spurned in our serious thought and are utilised in\r\nthe production of the effect of wit only. Among these we particularly\r\nfind associations of the sound and consonance types.\r\n\r\n4. Contradictory thoughts do not strive to eliminate one another, but\r\nremain side by side. They often unite to produce condensation _as if no\r\ncontradiction_ existed, or they form compromises for which we should\r\nnever forgive our thoughts, but which we frequently approve of in our\r\nactions.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the most conspicuous abnormal processes to which the\r\nthoughts which have previously been rationally formed are subjected in\r\nthe course of the dream-work. As the main feature of these processes we\r\nrecognise the high importance attached to the fact of rendering the\r\noccupation energy mobile and capable of discharge; the content and the\r\nactual significance of the psychic elements, to which these energies\r\nadhere, become a matter of secondary importance. One might possibly\r\nthink that the condensation and compromise formation is effected only in\r\nthe service of regression, when occasion arises for changing thoughts\r\ninto pictures. But the analysis and\xe2\x80\x94still more distinctly\xe2\x80\x94the synthesis\r\nof dreams which lack regression toward pictures, _e.g._ the dream\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAutodidasker\xe2\x80\x94Conversation with Court-Councillor N.,\xe2\x80\x9d present the same\r\nprocesses of displacement and condensation as the others.\r\n\r\nHence we cannot refuse to acknowledge that the two kinds of essentially\r\ndifferent psychic processes participate in the formation of the dream;\r\none forms perfectly correct dream thoughts which are equivalent to\r\nnormal thoughts, while the other treats these ideas in a highly\r\nsurprising and incorrect manner. The latter process we have already set\r\napart in Chapter VI as the dream-work proper. What have we now to\r\nadvance concerning this latter psychic process?\r\n\r\nWe should be unable to answer this question here if we had not\r\npenetrated considerably into the psychology of the neuroses and\r\nespecially of hysteria. From this we learn that the same\r\nincorrect psychic processes\xe2\x80\x94as well as others that have not been\r\nenumerated\xe2\x80\x94control the formation of hysterical symptoms. In hysteria,\r\ntoo, we at once find a series of perfectly correct thoughts equivalent\r\nto our conscious thoughts, of whose existence, however, in this form we\r\ncan learn nothing and which we can only subsequently reconstruct. If\r\nthey have forced their way anywhere to our perception, we discover from\r\nthe analysis of the symptom formed that these normal thoughts have been\r\nsubjected to abnormal treatment and _have been transformed into the\r\nsymptom by means of condensation and compromise formation, through\r\nsuperficial associations, under cover of contradictions, and eventually\r\nover the road of regression_. In view of the complete identity found\r\nbetween the peculiarities of the dream-work and of the psychic activity\r\nforming the psychoneurotic symptoms, we shall feel justified in\r\ntransferring to the dream the conclusions urged upon us by hysteria.\r\n\r\nFrom the theory of hysteria we borrow the proposition that _such an\r\nabnormal psychic elaboration of a normal train of thought takes place\r\nonly when the latter has been used for the transference of an\r\nunconscious wish which dates from the infantile life and is in a state\r\nof repression_. In accordance with this proposition we have construed\r\nthe theory of the dream on the assumption that the actuating dream-wish\r\ninvariably originates in the unconscious, which, as we ourselves have\r\nadmitted, cannot be universally demonstrated though it cannot be\r\nrefuted. But in order to explain the real meaning of the term\r\n_repression_, which we have employed so freely, we shall be obliged to\r\nmake some further addition to our psychological construction.\r\n\r\nWe have above elaborated the fiction of a primitive psychic apparatus,\r\nwhose work is regulated by the efforts to avoid accumulation of\r\nexcitement and as far as possible to maintain itself free from\r\nexcitement. For this reason it was constructed after the plan of a\r\nreflex apparatus; the motility, originally the path for the inner bodily\r\nchange, formed a discharging path standing at its disposal. We\r\nsubsequently discussed the psychic results of a feeling of\r\ngratification, and we might at the same time have introduced the second\r\nassumption, viz. that accumulation of excitement\xe2\x80\x94following certain\r\nmodalities that do not concern us\xe2\x80\x94is perceived as pain and sets the\r\napparatus in motion in order to reproduce a feeling of gratification in\r\nwhich the diminution of the excitement is perceived as pleasure. Such a\r\ncurrent in the apparatus which emanates from pain and strives for\r\npleasure we call a wish. We have said that nothing but a wish is capable\r\nof setting the apparatus in motion, and that the discharge of excitement\r\nin the apparatus is regulated automatically by the perception of\r\npleasure and pain. The first wish must have been an hallucinatory\r\noccupation of the memory for gratification. But this hallucination,\r\nunless it were maintained to the point of exhaustion, proved incapable\r\nof bringing about a cessation of the desire and consequently of securing\r\nthe pleasure connected with gratification.\r\n\r\nThus there was required a second activity\xe2\x80\x94in our terminology the\r\nactivity of a second system\xe2\x80\x94which should not permit the memory\r\noccupation to advance to perception and therefrom to restrict the\r\npsychic forces, but should lead the excitement emanating from the\r\ncraving stimulus by a devious path over the spontaneous motility which\r\nultimately should so change the outer world as to allow the real\r\nperception of the object of gratification to take place. Thus far we\r\nhave elaborated the plan of the psychic apparatus; these two systems are\r\nthe germ of the Unc. and Forec. which we include in the fully developed\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nIn order to be in a position successfully to change the outer world\r\nthrough the motility, there is required the accumulation of a large sum\r\nof experiences in the memory systems as well as a manifold fixation of\r\nthe relations which are evoked in this memory material by different\r\nend-presentations. We now proceed further with our assumption. The\r\nmanifold activity of the second system, tentatively sending forth and\r\nretracting energy, must on the one hand have full command over all\r\nmemory material, but on the other hand it would be a superfluous\r\nexpenditure for it to send to the individual mental paths large\r\nquantities of energy which would thus flow off to no purpose,\r\ndiminishing the quantity available for the transformation of the outer\r\nworld. In the interests of expediency I therefore postulate that the\r\nsecond system succeeds in maintaining the greater part of the occupation\r\nenergy in a dormant state and in using but a small portion for the\r\npurposes of displacement. The mechanism of these processes is entirely\r\nunknown to me; anyone who wishes to follow up these ideas must try to\r\nfind the physical analogies and prepare the way for a demonstration of\r\nthe process of motion in the stimulation of the neuron. I merely hold to\r\nthe idea that the activity of the first \xce\xa8-system is directed _to the\r\nfree outflow of the quantities of excitement_, and that the second\r\nsystem brings about an inhibition of this outflow through the energies\r\nemanating from it, _i.e._ it produces a _transformation into dormant\r\nenergy, probably by raising the level_. I therefore assume that under\r\nthe control of the second system as compared with the first, the course\r\nof the excitement is bound to entirely different mechanical conditions.\r\nAfter the second system has finished its tentative mental work, it\r\nremoves the inhibition and congestion of the excitements and allows\r\nthese excitements to flow off to the motility.\r\n\r\nAn interesting train of thought now presents itself if we consider the\r\nrelations of this inhibition of discharge by the second system to the\r\nregulation through the principle of pain. Let us now seek the\r\ncounterpart of the primary feeling of gratification, namely, the\r\nobjective feeling of fear. A perceptive stimulus acts on the primitive\r\napparatus, becoming the source of a painful emotion. This will then be\r\nfollowed by irregular motor manifestations until one of these withdraws\r\nthe apparatus from perception and at the same time from pain, but on the\r\nreappearance of the perception this manifestation will immediately\r\nrepeat itself (perhaps as a movement of flight) until the perception has\r\nagain disappeared. But there will here remain no tendency again to\r\noccupy the perception of the source of pain in the form of an\r\nhallucination or in any other form. On the contrary, there will be a\r\ntendency in the primary apparatus to abandon the painful memory picture\r\nas soon as it is in any way awakened, as the overflow of its excitement\r\nwould surely produce (more precisely, begin to produce) pain. The\r\ndeviation from memory, which is but a repetition of the former flight\r\nfrom perception, is facilitated also by the fact that, unlike\r\nperception, memory does not possess sufficient quality to excite\r\nconsciousness and thereby to attract to itself new energy. This easy and\r\nregularly occurring deviation of the psychic process from the former\r\npainful memory presents to us the model and the first example of\r\n_psychic repression_. As is generally known, much of this deviation from\r\nthe painful, much of the behaviour of the ostrich, can be readily\r\ndemonstrated even in the normal psychic life of adults.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of the principle of pain the first system is therefore\r\naltogether incapable of introducing anything unpleasant into the mental\r\nassociations. The system cannot do anything but wish. If this remained\r\nso the mental activity of the second system, which should have at its\r\ndisposal all the memories stored up by experiences, would be hindered.\r\nBut two ways are now opened: the work of the second system either frees\r\nitself completely from the principle of pain and continues its course,\r\npaying no heed to the painful reminiscence, or it contrives to occupy\r\nthe painful memory in such a manner as to preclude the liberation of\r\npain. We may reject the first possibility, as the principle of pain also\r\nmanifests itself as a regulator for the emotional discharge of the\r\nsecond system; we are, therefore, directed to the second possibility,\r\nnamely, that this system occupies a reminiscence in such a manner as to\r\ninhibit its discharge and hence, also, to inhibit the discharge\r\ncomparable to a motor innervation for the development of pain. Thus from\r\ntwo starting points we are led to the hypothesis that occupation through\r\nthe second system is at the same time an inhibition for the emotional\r\ndischarge, viz. from a consideration of the principle of pain and from\r\nthe principle of the smallest expenditure of innervation. Let us,\r\nhowever, keep to the fact\xe2\x80\x94this is the key to the theory of\r\nrepression\xe2\x80\x94that the second system is capable of occupying an idea only\r\nwhen it is in position to check the development of pain emanating from\r\nit. Whatever withdraws itself from this inhibition also remains\r\ninaccessible for the second system and would soon be abandoned by virtue\r\nof the principle of pain. The inhibition of pain, however, need not be\r\ncomplete; it must be permitted to begin, as it indicates to the second\r\nsystem the nature of the memory and possibly its defective adaptation\r\nfor the purpose sought by the mind.\r\n\r\nThe psychic process which is admitted by the first system only I shall\r\nnow call the _primary_ process; and the one resulting from the\r\ninhibition of the second system I shall call the _secondary_ process. I\r\nshow by another point for what purpose the second system is obliged to\r\ncorrect the primary process. The primary process strives for a discharge\r\nof the excitement in order to establish a _perception_ identity with the\r\nsum of excitement thus gathered; the secondary process has abandoned\r\nthis intention and undertaken instead the task of bringing about a\r\n_thought identity_. All thinking is only a circuitous path from the\r\nmemory of gratification taken as an end-presentation to the identical\r\noccupation of the same memory, which is again to be attained on the\r\ntrack of the motor experiences. The state of thinking must take an\r\ninterest in the connecting paths between the presentations without\r\nallowing itself to be misled by their intensities. But it is obvious\r\nthat condensations and intermediate or compromise formations occurring\r\nin the presentations impede the attainment of this end-identity; by\r\nsubstituting one idea for the other they deviate from the path which\r\notherwise would have been continued from the original idea. Such\r\nprocesses are therefore carefully avoided in the secondary thinking. Nor\r\nis it difficult to understand that the principle of pain also impedes\r\nthe progress of the mental stream in its pursuit of the thought\r\nidentity, though, indeed, it offers to the mental stream the most\r\nimportant points of departure. Hence the tendency of the thinking\r\nprocess must be to free itself more and more from exclusive adjustment\r\nby the principle of pain, and through the working of the mind to\r\nrestrict the affective development to that minimum which is necessary as\r\na signal. This refinement of the activity must have been attained\r\nthrough a recent over-occupation of energy brought about by\r\nconsciousness. But we are aware that this refinement is seldom\r\ncompletely successful even in the most normal psychic life and that our\r\nthoughts ever remain accessible to falsification through the\r\ninterference of the principle of pain.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not the breach in the functional efficiency of our\r\npsychic apparatus through which the thoughts forming the material of the\r\nsecondary mental work are enabled to make their way into the primary\r\npsychic process\xe2\x80\x94with which formula we may now describe the work leading\r\nto the dream and to the hysterical symptoms. This case of insufficiency\r\nresults from the union of the two factors from the history of our\r\nevolution; one of which belongs solely to the psychic apparatus and has\r\nexerted a determining influence on the relation of the two systems,\r\nwhile the other operates fluctuatingly and introduces motive forces of\r\norganic origin into the psychic life. Both originate in the infantile\r\nlife and result from the transformation which our psychic and somatic\r\norganism has undergone since the infantile period.\r\n\r\nWhen I termed one of the psychic processes in the psychic apparatus the\r\nprimary process, I did so not only in consideration of the order of\r\nprecedence and capability, but also as admitting the temporal relations\r\nto a share in the nomenclature. As far as our knowledge goes there is no\r\npsychic apparatus possessing only the primary process, and in so far it\r\nis a theoretic fiction; but so much is based on fact that the primary\r\nprocesses are present in the apparatus from the beginning, while the\r\nsecondary processes develop gradually in the course of life, inhibiting\r\nand covering the primary ones, and gaining complete mastery over them\r\nperhaps only at the height of life. Owing to this retarded appearance of\r\nthe secondary processes, the essence of our being, consisting in\r\nunconscious wish feelings, can neither be seized nor inhibited by the\r\nforeconscious, whose part is once for all restricted to the indication\r\nof the most suitable paths for the wish feelings originating in the\r\nunconscious. These unconscious wishes establish for all subsequent\r\npsychic efforts a compulsion to which they have to submit and which they\r\nmust strive if possible to divert from its course and direct to higher\r\naims. In consequence of this retardation of the foreconscious occupation\r\na large sphere of the memory material remains inaccessible.\r\n\r\nAmong these indestructible and unincumbered wish feelings originating\r\nfrom the infantile life, there are also some, the fulfilments of which\r\nhave entered into a relation of contradiction to the end-presentation of\r\nthe secondary thinking. The fulfilment of these wishes would no longer\r\nproduce an affect of pleasure but one of pain; _and it is just this\r\ntransformation of affect that constitutes the nature of what we\r\ndesignate as \xe2\x80\x9crepression,\xe2\x80\x9d in which we recognise the infantile first\r\nstep of passing adverse sentence or of rejecting through reason_. To\r\ninvestigate in what way and through what motive forces such a\r\ntransformation can be produced constitutes the problem of repression,\r\nwhich we need here only skim over. It will suffice to remark that such a\r\ntransformation of affect occurs in the course of development (one may\r\nthink of the appearance in infantile life of disgust which was\r\noriginally absent), and that it is connected with the activity of the\r\nsecondary system. The memories from which the unconscious wish brings\r\nabout the emotional discharge have never been accessible to the Forec.,\r\nand for that reason their emotional discharge cannot be inhibited. It is\r\njust on account of this affective development that these ideas are not\r\neven now accessible to the foreconscious thoughts to which they have\r\ntransferred their wishing power. On the contrary, the principle of pain\r\ncomes into play, and causes the Forec. to deviate from these thoughts of\r\ntransference. The latter, left to themselves, are \xe2\x80\x9crepressed,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus\r\nthe existence of a store of infantile memories, from the very beginning\r\nwithdrawn from the Forec., becomes the preliminary condition of\r\nrepression.\r\n\r\nIn the most favourable case the development of pain terminates as soon\r\nas the energy has been withdrawn from the thoughts of transference in\r\nthe Forec., and this effect characterises the intervention of the\r\nprinciple of pain as expedient. It is different, however, if the\r\nrepressed unconscious wish receives an organic enforcement which it can\r\nlend to its thoughts of transference and through which it can enable\r\nthem to make an effort towards penetration with their excitement, even\r\nafter they have been abandoned by the occupation of the Forec. A\r\ndefensive struggle then ensues, inasmuch as the Forec. reinforces the\r\nantagonism against the repressed ideas, and subsequently this leads to a\r\npenetration by the thoughts of transference (the carriers of the\r\nunconscious wish) in some form of compromise through symptom formation.\r\nBut from the moment that the suppressed thoughts are powerfully occupied\r\nby the unconscious wish-feeling and abandoned by the foreconscious\r\noccupation, they succumb to the primary psychic process and strive only\r\nfor motor discharge; or, if the path be free, for hallucinatory revival\r\nof the desired perception identity. We have previously found,\r\nempirically, that the incorrect processes described are enacted only\r\nwith thoughts that exist in the repression. We now grasp another part of\r\nthe connection. These incorrect processes are those that are primary in\r\nthe psychic apparatus; _they appear wherever thoughts abandoned by the\r\nforeconscious occupation are left to themselves, and can fill themselves\r\nwith the uninhibited energy, striving for discharge from the\r\nunconscious_. We may add a few further observations to support the view\r\nthat these processes designated \xe2\x80\x9cincorrect\xe2\x80\x9d are really not\r\nfalsifications of the normal defective thinking, but the modes of\r\nactivity of the psychic apparatus when freed from inhibition. Thus we\r\nsee that the transference of the foreconscious excitement to the\r\nmotility takes place according to the same processes, and that the\r\nconnection of the foreconscious presentations with words readily\r\nmanifest the same displacements and mixtures which are described to\r\ninattention. Finally, I should like to adduce proof that an increase of\r\nwork necessarily results from the inhibition of these primary courses\r\nfrom the fact that we gain a _comical effect_, a surplus to be\r\ndischarged through laughter, _if we allow these streams of thought to\r\ncome to consciousness_.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the psychoneuroses asserts with complete certainty that\r\nonly sexual wish-feelings from the infantile life experience repression\r\n(emotional transformation) during the developmental period of childhood.\r\nThese are capable of returning to activity at a later period of\r\ndevelopment, and then have the faculty of being revived, either as a\r\nconsequence of the sexual constitution, which is really formed from the\r\noriginal bisexuality, or in consequence of unfavourable influences of\r\nthe sexual life; and they thus supply the motive power for all\r\npsychoneurotic symptom formations. It is only by the introduction of\r\nthese sexual forces that the gaps still demonstrable in the theory of\r\nrepression can be filled. I will leave it undecided whether the\r\npostulate of the sexual and infantile may also be asserted for the\r\ntheory of the dream; I leave this here unfinished because I have already\r\npassed a step beyond the demonstrable in assuming that the dream-wish\r\ninvariably originates from the unconscious.[FY] Nor will I further\r\ninvestigate the difference in the play of the psychic forces in the\r\ndream formation and in the formation of the hysterical symptoms, for to\r\ndo this we ought to possess a more explicit knowledge of one of the\r\nmembers to be compared. But I regard another point as important, and\r\nwill here confess that it was on account of this very point that I have\r\njust undertaken this entire discussion concerning the two psychic\r\nsystems, their modes of operation, and the repression. For it is now\r\nimmaterial whether I have conceived the psychological relations in\r\nquestion with approximate correctness, or, as is easily possible in such\r\na difficult matter, in an erroneous and fragmentary manner. Whatever\r\nchanges may be made in the interpretation of the psychic censor and of\r\nthe correct and of the abnormal elaboration of the dream content, the\r\nfact nevertheless remains that such processes are active in dream\r\nformation, and that essentially they show the closest analogy to the\r\nprocesses observed in the formation of the hysterical symptoms. The\r\ndream is not a pathological phenomenon, and it does not leave behind an\r\nenfeeblement of the mental faculties. The objection that no deduction\r\ncan be drawn regarding the dreams of healthy persons from my own dreams\r\nand from those of neurotic patients may be rejected without comment.\r\nHence, when we draw conclusions from the phenomena as to their motive\r\nforces, we recognise that the psychic mechanism made use of by the\r\nneuroses is not created by a morbid disturbance of the psychic life, but\r\nis found ready in the normal structure of the psychic apparatus. The two\r\npsychic systems, the censor crossing between them, the inhibition and\r\nthe covering of the one activity by the other, the relations of both to\r\nconsciousness\xe2\x80\x94or whatever may offer a more correct interpretation of the\r\nactual conditions in their stead\xe2\x80\x94all these belong to the normal\r\nstructure of our psychic instrument, and the dream points out for us one\r\nof the roads leading to a knowledge of this structure. If, in addition\r\nto our knowledge, we wish to be contented with a minimum perfectly\r\nestablished, we shall say that the dream gives us proof that the\r\n_suppressed material continues to exist even in the normal person and\r\nremains capable of psychic activity_. The dream itself is one of the\r\nmanifestations of this suppressed material; theoretically, this is true\r\nin _all_ cases; according to substantial experience it is true in at\r\nleast a great number of such as most conspicuously display the prominent\r\ncharacteristics of dream life. The suppressed psychic material, which in\r\nthe waking state has been prevented from expression and cut off from\r\ninternal perception _by the antagonistic adjustment of the\r\ncontradictions_, finds ways and means of obtruding itself on\r\nconsciousness during the night under the domination of the compromise\r\nformations.\r\n\r\n           \xe2\x80\x9c_Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt any rate the interpretation of dreams is the _via regia_ to a\r\nknowledge of the unconscious in the psychic life.\r\n\r\nIn following the analysis of the dream we have made some progress toward\r\nan understanding of the composition of this most marvellous and most\r\nmysterious of instruments; to be sure, we have not gone very far, but\r\nenough of a beginning has been made to allow us to advance from other\r\nso-called pathological formations further into the analysis of the\r\nunconscious. Disease\xe2\x80\x94at least that which is justly termed functional\xe2\x80\x94is\r\nnot due to the destruction of this apparatus, and the establishment of\r\nnew splittings in its interior; it is rather to be explained dynamically\r\nthrough the strengthening and weakening of the components in the play of\r\nforces by which so many activities are concealed during the normal\r\nfunction. We have been able to show in another place how the composition\r\nof the apparatus from the two systems permits a subtilisation even of\r\nthe normal activity which would be impossible for a single system.[FZ]\r\n\r\n\r\n           (_f_) _The Unconscious and Consciousness\xe2\x80\x94Reality._\r\n\r\nOn closer inspection we find that it is not the existence of two systems\r\nnear the motor end of the apparatus but of two kinds of processes or\r\nmodes of emotional discharge, the assumption of which was explained in\r\nthe psychological discussions of the previous chapter. This can make no\r\ndifference for us, for we must always be ready to drop our auxiliary\r\nideas whenever we deem ourselves in position to replace them by\r\nsomething else approaching more closely to the unknown reality. Let us\r\nnow try to correct some views which might be erroneously formed as long\r\nas we regarded the two systems in the crudest and most obvious sense as\r\ntwo localities within the psychic apparatus, views which have left their\r\ntraces in the terms \xe2\x80\x9crepression\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpenetration.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus, when we say\r\nthat an unconscious idea strives for transference into the foreconscious\r\nin order later to penetrate consciousness, we do not mean that a second\r\nidea is to be formed situated in a new locality like an interlineation\r\nnear which the original continues to remain; also, when we speak of\r\npenetration into consciousness, we wish carefully to avoid any idea of\r\nchange of locality. When we say that a foreconscious idea is repressed\r\nand subsequently taken up by the unconscious, we might be tempted by\r\nthese figures, borrowed from the idea of a struggle over a territory, to\r\nassume that an arrangement is really broken up in one psychic locality\r\nand replaced by a new one in the other locality. For these comparisons\r\nwe substitute what would seem to correspond better with the real state\r\nof affairs by saying that an energy occupation is displaced to or\r\nwithdrawn from a certain arrangement so that the psychic formation falls\r\nunder the domination of a system or is withdrawn from the same. Here\r\nagain we replace a topical mode of presentation by a dynamic; it is not\r\nthe psychic formation that appears to us as the moving factor but the\r\ninnervation of the same.\r\n\r\nI deem it appropriate and justifiable, however, to apply ourselves still\r\nfurther to the illustrative conception of the two systems. We shall\r\navoid any misapplication of this manner of representation if we remember\r\nthat presentations, thoughts, and psychic formations should generally\r\nnot be localised in the organic elements of the nervous system, but, so\r\nto speak, between them, where resistances and paths form the correlate\r\ncorresponding to them. Everything that can become an object of our\r\ninternal perception is virtual, like the image in the telescope produced\r\nby the passage of the rays of light. But we are justified in assuming\r\nthe existence of the systems, which have nothing psychic in themselves\r\nand which never become accessible to our psychic perception,\r\ncorresponding to the lenses of the telescope which design the image. If\r\nwe continue this comparison, we may say that the censor between two\r\nsystems corresponds to the refraction of rays during their passage into\r\na new medium.\r\n\r\nThus far we have made psychology on our own responsibility; it is now\r\ntime to examine the theoretical opinions governing present-day\r\npsychology and to test their relation to our theories. The question of\r\nthe unconscious in psychology is, according to the authoritative words\r\nof Lipps,[GA] less a psychological question than the question of\r\npsychology. As long as psychology settled this question with the verbal\r\nexplanation that the \xe2\x80\x9cpsychic\xe2\x80\x9d is the \xe2\x80\x9cconscious\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cunconscious\r\npsychic occurrences\xe2\x80\x9d are an obvious contradiction, a psychological\r\nestimate of the observations gained by the physician from abnormal\r\nmental states was precluded. The physician and the philosopher agree\r\nonly when both acknowledge that unconscious psychic processes are \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nappropriate and well-justified expression for an established fact.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nphysician cannot but reject with a shrug of his shoulders the assertion\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cconsciousness is the indispensable quality of the psychic\xe2\x80\x9d; he may\r\nassume, if his respect for the utterings of the philosophers still be\r\nstrong enough, that he and they do not treat the same subject and do not\r\npursue the same science. For a single intelligent observation of the\r\npsychic life of a neurotic, a single analysis of a dream must force upon\r\nhim the unalterable conviction that the most complicated and correct\r\nmental operations, to which no one will refuse the name of psychic\r\noccurrences, may take place without exciting the consciousness of the\r\nperson. It is true that the physician does not learn of these\r\nunconscious processes until they have exerted such an effect on\r\nconsciousness as to admit communication or observation. But this effect\r\nof consciousness may show a psychic character widely differing from the\r\nunconscious process, so that the internal perception cannot possibly\r\nrecognise the one as a substitute for the other. The physician must\r\nreserve for himself the right to penetrate, by a process of deduction,\r\nfrom the effect on consciousness to the unconscious psychic process; he\r\nlearns in this way that the effect on consciousness is only a remote\r\npsychic product of the unconscious process and that the latter has not\r\nbecome conscious as such; that it has been in existence and operative\r\nwithout betraying itself in any way to consciousness.\r\n\r\nA reaction from the over-estimation of the quality of consciousness\r\nbecomes the indispensable preliminary condition for any correct insight\r\ninto the behaviour of the psychic. In the words of Lipps, the\r\nunconscious must be accepted as the general basis of the psychic life.\r\nThe unconscious is the larger circle which includes within itself the\r\nsmaller circle of the conscious; everything conscious has its\r\npreliminary step in the unconscious, whereas the unconscious may stop\r\nwith this step and still claim full value as a psychic activity.\r\nProperly speaking, the unconscious is the real psychic; _its inner\r\nnature is just as unknown to us as the reality of the external world,\r\nand it is just as imperfectly reported to us through the data of\r\nconsciousness as is the external world through the indications of our\r\nsensory organs_.\r\n\r\nA series of dream problems which have intensely occupied older authors\r\nwill be laid aside when the old opposition between conscious life and\r\ndream life is abandoned and the unconscious psychic assigned to its\r\nproper place. Thus many of the activities whose performances in the\r\ndream have excited our admiration are now no longer to be attributed to\r\nthe dream but to unconscious thinking, which is also active during the\r\nday. If, according to Scherner, the dream seems to play with a\r\nsymbolising representation of the body, we know that this is the work of\r\ncertain unconscious phantasies which have probably given in to sexual\r\nemotions, and that these phantasies come to expression not only in\r\ndreams but also in hysterical phobias and in other symptoms. If the\r\ndream continues and settles activities of the day and even brings to\r\nlight valuable inspirations, we have only to subtract from it the dream\r\ndisguise as a feat of dream-work and a mark of assistance from obscure\r\nforces in the depth of the mind (_cf._ the devil in Tartini\xe2\x80\x99s sonata\r\ndream). The intellectual task as such must be attributed to the same\r\npsychic forces which perform all such tasks during the day. We are\r\nprobably far too much inclined to over-estimate the conscious character\r\neven of intellectual and artistic productions. From the communications\r\nof some of the most highly productive persons, such as Goethe and\r\nHelmholtz, we learn, indeed, that the most essential and original parts\r\nin their creations came to them in the form of inspirations and reached\r\ntheir perceptions almost finished. There is nothing strange about the\r\nassistance of the conscious activity in other cases where there was a\r\nconcerted effort of all the psychic forces. But it is a much abused\r\nprivilege of the conscious activity that it is allowed to hide from us\r\nall other activities wherever it participates.\r\n\r\nIt will hardly be worth while to take up the historical significance of\r\ndreams as a special subject. Where, for instance, a chieftain has been\r\nurged through a dream to engage in a bold undertaking the success of\r\nwhich has had the effect of changing history, a new problem results only\r\nso long as the dream, regarded as a strange power, is contrasted with\r\nother more familiar psychic forces; the problem, however, disappears\r\nwhen we regard the dream as a form of expression for feelings which are\r\nburdened with resistance during the day and which can receive\r\nreinforcements at night from deep emotional sources.[GB] But the great\r\nrespect shown by the ancients for the dream is based on a correct\r\npsychological surmise. It is a homage paid to the unsubdued and\r\nindestructible in the human mind, and to the demoniacal which furnishes\r\nthe dream-wish and which we find again in our unconscious.\r\n\r\nNot inadvisedly do I use the expression \xe2\x80\x9cin our unconscious,\xe2\x80\x9d for what\r\nwe so designate does not coincide with the unconscious of the\r\nphilosophers, nor with the unconscious of Lipps. In the latter uses it\r\nis intended to designate only the opposite of conscious. That there are\r\nalso unconscious psychic processes beside the conscious ones is the\r\nhotly contested and energetically defended issue. Lipps gives us the\r\nmore far-reaching theory that everything psychic exists as unconscious,\r\nbut that some of it may exist also as conscious. But it was not to prove\r\nthis theory that we have adduced the phenomena of the dream and of the\r\nhysterical symptom formation; the observation of normal life alone\r\nsuffices to establish its correctness beyond any doubt. The new fact\r\nthat we have learned from the analysis of the psychopathological\r\nformations, and indeed from their first member, viz. dreams, is that the\r\nunconscious\xe2\x80\x94hence the psychic\xe2\x80\x94occurs as a function of two separate\r\nsystems and that it occurs as such even in normal psychic life.\r\nConsequently there are two kinds of unconscious, which we do not as yet\r\nfind distinguished by the psychologists. Both are unconscious in the\r\npsychological sense; but in our sense the first, which we call Unc., is\r\nlikewise incapable of consciousness, whereas the second we term \xe2\x80\x9cForec.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nbecause its emotions, after the observance of certain rules, can reach\r\nconsciousness, perhaps not before they have again undergone censorship,\r\nbut still regardless of the Unc. system. The fact that in order to\r\nattain consciousness the emotions must traverse an unalterable series of\r\nevents or succession of instances, as is betrayed through their\r\nalteration by the censor, has helped us to draw a comparison from\r\nspatiality. We described the relations of the two systems to each other\r\nand to consciousness by saying that the system Forec. is like a screen\r\nbetween the system Unc. and consciousness. The system Forec. not only\r\nbars access to consciousness, but also controls the entrance to\r\nvoluntary motility and is capable of sending out a sum of mobile energy,\r\na portion of which is familiar to us as attention.\r\n\r\nWe must also steer clear of the distinctions superconscious and\r\nsubconscious which have found so much favour in the more recent\r\nliterature on the psychoneuroses, for just such a distinction seems to\r\nemphasize the equivalence of the psychic and the conscious.\r\n\r\nWhat part now remains in our description of the once all-powerful and\r\nall-overshadowing consciousness? None other than that of a sensory organ\r\nfor the perception of psychic qualities. According to the fundamental\r\nidea of schematic undertaking we can conceive the conscious perception\r\nonly as the particular activity of an independent system for which the\r\nabbreviated designation \xe2\x80\x9cCons.\xe2\x80\x9d commends itself. This system we conceive\r\nto be similar in its mechanical characteristics to the perception system\r\nP, hence excitable by qualities and incapable of retaining the trace of\r\nchanges, _i.e._ it is devoid of memory. The psychic apparatus which,\r\nwith the sensory organs of the P-systems, is turned to the outer world,\r\nis itself the outer world for the sensory organ of Cons.; the\r\nteleological justification of which rests on this relationship. We are\r\nhere once more confronted with the principle of the succession of\r\ninstances which seems to dominate the structure of the apparatus. The\r\nmaterial under excitement flows to the Cons. sensory organ from two\r\nsides, firstly from the P-system whose excitement, qualitatively\r\ndetermined, probably experiences a new elaboration until it comes to\r\nconscious perception; and, secondly, from the interior of the apparatus\r\nitself, the quantitative processes of which are perceived as a\r\nqualitative series of pleasure and pain as soon as they have undergone\r\ncertain changes.\r\n\r\nThe philosophers, who have learned that correct and highly complicated\r\nthought structures are possible even without the co-operation of\r\nconsciousness, have found it difficult to attribute any function to\r\nconsciousness; it has appeared to them a superfluous mirroring of the\r\nperfected psychic process. The analogy of our Cons. system with the\r\nsystems of perception relieves us of this embarrassment. We see that\r\nperception through our sensory organs results in directing the\r\noccupation of attention to those paths on which the incoming sensory\r\nexcitement is diffused; the qualitative excitement of the P-system\r\nserves the mobile quantity of the psychic apparatus as a regulator for\r\nits discharge. We may claim the same function for the overlying sensory\r\norgan of the Cons. system. By assuming new qualities, it furnishes a new\r\ncontribution toward the guidance and suitable distribution of the mobile\r\noccupation quantities. By means of the perceptions of pleasure and pain,\r\nit influences the course of the occupations within the psychic\r\napparatus, which normally operates unconsciously and through the\r\ndisplacement of quantities. It is probable that the principle of pain\r\nfirst regulates the displacements of occupation automatically, but it is\r\nquite possible that the consciousness of these qualities adds a second\r\nand more subtle regulation which may even oppose the first and perfect\r\nthe working capacity of the apparatus by placing it in a position\r\ncontrary to its original design for occupying and developing even that\r\nwhich is connected with the liberation of pain. We learn from\r\nneuropsychology that an important part in the functional activity of the\r\napparatus is attributed to such regulations through the qualitative\r\nexcitation of the sensory organs. The automatic control of the primary\r\nprinciple of pain and the restriction of mental capacity connected with\r\nit are broken by the sensible regulations, which in their turn are again\r\nautomatisms. We learn that the repression which, though originally\r\nexpedient, terminates nevertheless in a harmful rejection of inhibition\r\nand of psychic domination, is so much more easily accomplished with\r\nreminiscences than with perceptions, because in the former there is no\r\nincrease in occupation through the excitement of the psychic sensory\r\norgans. When an idea to be rejected has once failed to become conscious\r\nbecause it has succumbed to repression, it can be repressed on other\r\noccasions only because it has been withdrawn from conscious perception\r\non other grounds. These are hints employed by therapy in order to bring\r\nabout a retrogression of accomplished repressions.\r\n\r\nThe value of the over-occupation which is produced by the regulating\r\ninfluence of the Cons. sensory organ on the mobile quantity, is\r\ndemonstrated in the teleological connection by nothing more clearly than\r\nby the creation of a new series of qualities and consequently a new\r\nregulation which constitutes the precedence of man over the animals. For\r\nthe mental processes are in themselves devoid of quality except for the\r\nexcitements of pleasure and pain accompanying them, which, as we know,\r\nare to be held in check as possible disturbances of thought. In order to\r\nendow them with a quality, they are associated in man with verbal\r\nmemories, the qualitative remnants of which suffice to draw upon them\r\nthe attention of consciousness which in turn endows thought with a new\r\nmobile energy.\r\n\r\nThe manifold problems of consciousness in their entirety can be examined\r\nonly through an analysis of the hysterical mental process. From this\r\nanalysis we receive the impression that the transition from the\r\nforeconscious to the occupation of consciousness is also connected with\r\na censorship similar to the one between the Unc. and the Forec. This\r\ncensorship, too, begins to act only with the reaching of a certain\r\nquantitative degree, so that few intense thought formations escape it.\r\nEvery possible case of detention from consciousness, as well as of\r\npenetration to consciousness, under restriction is found included within\r\nthe picture of the psychoneurotic phenomena; every case points to the\r\nintimate and two-fold connection between the censor and consciousness. I\r\nshall conclude these psychological discussions with the report of two\r\nsuch occurrences.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of a consultation a few years ago the subject was an\r\nintelligent and innocent-looking girl. Her attire was strange; whereas a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s garb is usually groomed to the last fold, she had one of her\r\nstockings hanging down and two of her waist buttons opened. She\r\ncomplained of pains in one of her legs, and exposed her leg unrequested.\r\nHer chief complaint, however, was in her own words as follows: She had a\r\nfeeling in her body as if something was stuck into it which moved to and\r\nfro and made her tremble through and through. This sometimes made her\r\nwhole body stiff. On hearing this, my colleague in consultation looked\r\nat me; the complaint was quite plain to him. To both of us it seemed\r\npeculiar that the patient\xe2\x80\x99s mother thought nothing of the matter; of\r\ncourse she herself must have been repeatedly in the situation described\r\nby her child. As for the girl, she had no idea of the import of her\r\nwords or she would never have allowed them to pass her lips. Here the\r\ncensor had been deceived so successfully that under the mask of an\r\ninnocent complaint a phantasy was admitted to consciousness which\r\notherwise would have remained in the foreconscious.\r\n\r\nAnother example: I began the psychoanalytic treatment of a boy of\r\nfourteen years who was suffering from _tic convulsif_, hysterical\r\nvomiting, headache, &c., by assuring him that, after closing his eyes,\r\nhe would see pictures or have ideas, which I requested him to\r\ncommunicate to me. He answered by describing pictures. The last\r\nimpression he had received before coming to me was visually revived in\r\nhis memory. He had played a game of checkers with his uncle, and now saw\r\nthe checker-board before him. He commented on various positions that\r\nwere favourable or unfavourable, on moves that were not safe to make. He\r\nthen saw a dagger lying on the checker-board, an object belonging to his\r\nfather, but transferred to the checker-board by his phantasy. Then a\r\nsickle was lying on the board; next a scythe was added; and, finally, he\r\nbeheld the likeness of an old peasant mowing the grass in front of the\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s distant parental home. A few days later I discovered the meaning\r\nof this series of pictures. Disagreeable family relations had made the\r\nboy nervous. It was the case of a strict and crabbed father who lived\r\nunhappily with his mother, and whose educational methods consisted in\r\nthreats; of the separation of his father from his tender and delicate\r\nmother, and the remarrying of his father, who one day brought home a\r\nyoung woman as his new mamma. The illness of the fourteen-year-old boy\r\nbroke out a few days later. It was the suppressed anger against his\r\nfather that had composed these pictures into intelligible allusions. The\r\nmaterial was furnished by a reminiscence from mythology. The sickle was\r\nthe one with which Zeus castrated his father; the scythe and the\r\nlikeness of the peasant represented Kronos, the violent old man who eats\r\nhis children and upon whom Zeus wreaks vengeance in so unfilial a\r\nmanner. The marriage of the father gave the boy an opportunity to return\r\nthe reproaches and threats of his father\xe2\x80\x94which had previously been made\r\nbecause the child played with his genitals (the checker-board; the\r\nprohibitive moves; the dagger with which a person may be killed). We\r\nhave here long repressed memories and their unconscious remnants which,\r\nunder the guise of senseless pictures have slipped into consciousness by\r\ndevious paths left open to them.\r\n\r\nI should then expect to find the theoretical value of the study of\r\ndreams in its contribution to psychological knowledge and in its\r\npreparation for an understanding of neuroses. Who can foresee the\r\nimportance of a thorough knowledge of the structure and activities of\r\nthe psychic apparatus when even our present state of knowledge produces\r\na happy therapeutic influence in the curable forms of the\r\npsychoneuroses? What about the practical value of such study someone may\r\nask, for psychic knowledge and for the discovering of the secret\r\npeculiarities of individual character? Have not the unconscious feelings\r\nrevealed by the dream the value of real forces in the psychic life?\r\nShould we take lightly the ethical significance of the suppressed wishes\r\nwhich, as they now create dreams, may some day create other things?\r\n\r\nI do not feel justified in answering these questions. I have not thought\r\nfurther upon this side of the dream problem. I believe, however, that at\r\nall events the Roman Emperor was in the wrong who ordered one of his\r\nsubjects executed because the latter dreamt that he had killed the\r\nEmperor. He should first have endeavoured to discover the significance\r\nof the dream; most probably it was not what it seemed to be. And even if\r\na dream of different content had the significance of this offence\r\nagainst majesty, it would still have been in place to remember the words\r\nof Plato, that the virtuous man contents himself with dreaming that\r\nwhich the wicked man does in actual life. I am therefore of the opinion\r\nthat it is best to accord freedom to dreams. Whether any reality is to\r\nbe attributed to the unconscious wishes, and in what sense, I am not\r\nprepared to say offhand. Reality must naturally be denied to all\r\ntransition\xe2\x80\x94and intermediate thoughts. If we had before us the\r\nunconscious wishes, brought to their last and truest expression, we\r\nshould still do well to remember that more than one single form of\r\nexistence must be ascribed to the psychic reality. Action and the\r\nconscious expression of thought mostly suffice for the practical need of\r\njudging a man\xe2\x80\x99s character. Action, above all, merits to be placed in the\r\nfirst rank; for many of the impulses penetrating consciousness are\r\nneutralised by real forces of the psychic life before they are converted\r\ninto action; indeed, the reason why they frequently do not encounter any\r\npsychic obstacle on their way is because the unconscious is certain of\r\ntheir meeting with resistances later. In any case it is instructive to\r\nbecome familiar with the much raked-up soil from which our virtues\r\nproudly arise. For the complication of human character moving\r\ndynamically in all directions very rarely accommodates itself to\r\nadjustment through a simple alternative, as our antiquated moral\r\nphilosophy would have it.\r\n\r\nAnd how about the value of the dream for a knowledge of the future?\r\nThat, of course, we cannot consider.[GC] One feels inclined to\r\nsubstitute: \xe2\x80\x9cfor a knowledge of the past.\xe2\x80\x9d For the dream originates from\r\nthe past in every sense. To be sure the ancient belief that the dream\r\nreveals the future is not entirely devoid of truth. By representing to\r\nus a wish as fulfilled the dream certainly leads us into the future; but\r\nthis future, taken by the dreamer as present, has been formed into the\r\nlikeness of that past by the indestructible wish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VIII\r\n                             LITERARY INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Aristoteles. _\xc3\x9cber Tr\xc3\xa4ume und Traumdeutungen._ Translated by Bender.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Artemidoros aus Daldis. _Symbolik der Tr\xc3\xa4ume._ Translated by\r\n  Friedrich.

Gruppe, _Griechische Mythologie und\r\n  Religionsgeschichte_, p. 390. \xe2\x80\x9cDreams were divided into two classes;\r\n  the first were influenced only by the present (or past), and were\r\n  unimportant for the future: they embraced the \xe1\xbc\x90\xce\xbd\xe1\xbd\xbb\xcf\x80\xce\xbd\xce\xb9\xce\xb1, insomnia, which\r\n  immediately produces the given idea or its opposite, _e.g._ hunger or\r\n  its satiation, and the \xcf\x86\xce\xb1\xce\xbd\xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xb1\xcf\x83\xce\xbc\xce\xb1\xcf\x84\xce\xb1, which elaborates the given idea\r\n  phantastically, as _e.g._ the nightmare, ephialtes. The second class\r\n  was, on the other hand, determinant for the future. To this belong:\r\n  (1) direct prophecies received in the dream (\xcf\x87\xcf\x81\xce\xb7\xce\xbc\xce\xb1\xcf\x84\xce\xb9\xcf\x83\xce\xbc\xe1\xbd\xb9\xcf\x82, oraculum);\r\n  (2) the foretelling of a future event (\xe1\xbd\x85\xcf\x81\xce\xb1\xce\xbc\xce\xb1); (3) the symbolic or the\r\n  dream requiring interpretation (\xe1\xbd\x84\xce\xbd\xce\xb5\xce\xb9\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, somnium). This theory has\r\n  been preserved for many centuries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFootnote F:\r\n\r\n  From subsequent experience I am able to state that it is not at all\r\n  rare to find in dreams repetitions of harmless or unimportant\r\n  occupations of the waking state, such as packing trunks, preparing\r\n  food, work in the kitchen, &c., but in such dreams the dreamer himself\r\n  emphasizes not the character but the reality of the memory, \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\n  really done all this in the day time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFootnote G:\r\n\r\n  _Chauffeurs_ were bands of robbers in the Vend\xc3\xa9e who resorted to this\r\n  form of torture.\r\n\r\nFootnote H:\r\n\r\n  Gigantic persons in a dream justify the assumption that it deals with\r\n  a scene from the dreamer\xe2\x80\x99s childhood.\r\n\r\nFootnote I:\r\n\r\n  The first volume of this Norwegian author, containing a complete\r\n  description of dreams, has recently appeared in German. See Index of\r\n  Literature, No. [74a].\r\n\r\nFootnote J:\r\n\r\n  Periodically recurrent dreams have been observed repeatedly. _Cf._ the\r\n  collection of Chabaneix.[11]\r\n\r\nFootnote K:\r\n\r\n  Silberer has shown by nice examples how in the state of sleepiness\r\n  even abstract thoughts may be changed into illustrative plastic\r\n  pictures which express the same thing (_Jahrbuch_ von Bleuler-Freud,\r\n  vol. i. 1900).\r\n\r\nFootnote L:\r\n\r\n  Haffner[32] made an attempt similar to Delb\xc5\x93uf\xe2\x80\x99s to explain the dream\r\n  activity on the basis of an alteration which must result in an\r\n  introduction of an abnormal condition in the otherwise correct\r\n  function of the intact psychic apparatus, but he described this\r\n  condition in somewhat different words. He states that the first\r\n  distinguishing mark of the dream is the absence of time and space,\r\n  _i.e._ the emancipation of the presentation from the position in the\r\n  order of time and space which is common to the individual. Allied to\r\n  this is the second fundamental character of the dream, the mistaking\r\n  of the hallucinations, imaginations, and phantasy-combinations for\r\n  objective perceptions. The sum total of the higher psychic forces,\r\n  especially formation of ideas, judgment, and argumentation on the one\r\n  hand, and the free self-determination on the other hand, connect\r\n  themselves with the sensory phantasy pictures and at all times have\r\n  them as a substratum. These activities too, therefore, participate in\r\n  the irregularity of the dream presentation. We say they participate,\r\n  for our faculties of judgment and will power are in themselves in no\r\n  way altered during sleep. In reference to activity, we are just as\r\n  keen and just as free as in the waking state. A man cannot act\r\n  contrary to the laws of thought, even in the dream, _i.e._ he is\r\n  unable to harmonise with that which represents itself as contrary to\r\n  him, &c.; he can only desire in the dream that which he presents to\r\n  himself as good (_sub ratione boni_). But in this application of the\r\n  laws of thinking and willing the human mind is led astray in the dream\r\n  through mistaking one presentation for another. It thus happens that\r\n  we form and commit in the dream the greatest contradictions, while, on\r\n  the other hand, we display the keenest judgments and the most\r\n  consequential chains of reasoning, and can make the most virtuous and\r\n  sacred resolutions. Lack of orientation is the whole secret of the\r\n  flight by which our phantasy moves in the dream, and lack of critical\r\n  reflection and mutual understanding with others is the main source of\r\n  the reckless extravagances of our judgments, hopes, and wishes in the\r\n  dream (p. 18).\r\n\r\nFootnote M:\r\n\r\n  _Cf._ Haffner[32] and Spitta[64].\r\n\r\nFootnote N:\r\n\r\n  _Grundz\xc3\xbcge des Systems der Anthropologie._ Erlangen, 1850 (quoted by\r\n  Spitta).\r\n\r\nFootnote O:\r\n\r\n  _Das Traumleben und seine Deutung_, 1868 (cited by Spitta, p. 192).\r\n\r\nFootnote P:\r\n\r\n  H. Swoboda, _Die Perioden des Menschlichen Organismus_, 1904.\r\n\r\nFootnote Q:\r\n\r\n  In a novel, _Gradiva_, of the poet W. Jensen, I accidentally\r\n  discovered several artificial dreams which were formed with perfect\r\n  correctness and which could be interpreted as though they had not been\r\n  invented, but had been dreamt by actual persons. The poet declared,\r\n  upon my inquiry, that he was unacquainted with my theory of dreams. I\r\n  have made use of this correspondence between my investigation and the\r\n  creative work of the poet as a proof of the correctness of my method\r\n  of dream analysis (\xe2\x80\x9cDer Wahn und die Tr\xc3\xa4ume,\xe2\x80\x9d in W. Jensen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n  _Gradiva_, No. 1 of the _Schriften zur angewandten Seelenkunde_, 1906,\r\n  edited by me). Dr. Alfred Robitsek has since shown that the dream of\r\n  the hero in Goethe\xe2\x80\x99s _Egmont_ may be interpreted as correctly as an\r\n  actually experienced dream (\xe2\x80\x9cDie Analyse von Egmont\xe2\x80\x99s Tr\xc3\xa4ume,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n  _Jahrbuch_, edited by Bleuler-Freud, vol. ii., 1910.)\r\n\r\nFootnote R:\r\n\r\n  After the completion of my manuscript, a paper by Stumpf[65] came to\r\n  my notice which agrees with my work in attempting to prove that the\r\n  dream is full of meaning and capable of interpretation. But the\r\n  interpretation is undertaken by means of an allegorising symbolism,\r\n  without warrant for the universal applicability of the procedure.\r\n\r\nFootnote S:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Alfred Robitsek calls my attention to the fact that Oriental dream\r\n  books, of which ours are pitiful plagiarisms, undertake the\r\n  interpretation of dream elements, mostly according to the assonance\r\n  and similarity of the words. Since these relationships must be lost by\r\n  translation into our language, the incomprehensibility of the\r\n  substitutions in our popular \xe2\x80\x9cdream books\xe2\x80\x9d may have its origin in this\r\n  fact. Information as to the extraordinary significance of puns and\r\n  punning in ancient Oriental systems of culture may be found in the\r\n  writings of Hugo Winckler. The nicest example of a dream\r\n  interpretation which has come down to us from antiquity is based on a\r\n  play upon words. Artemidoros[2] relates the following (p. 225): \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\n  seems to me that Aristandros gives a happy interpretation to Alexander\r\n  of Macedon. When the latter held Tyros shut in and in a state of\r\n  siege, and was angry and depressed over the great loss of time, he\r\n  dreamed that he saw a Satyros dancing on his shield. It happened that\r\n  Aristandros was near Tyros and in the convoy of the king, who was\r\n  waging war on the Syrians. By disjoining the word Satyros into \xcf\x83\xce\xb1 and\r\n  \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xbb\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xcf\x82, he induced the king to become more aggressive in the siege, and\r\n  thus he became master of the city. (\xce\xa3\xce\xb1 \xcf\x84\xe1\xbd\xbb\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xcf\x82\xe2\x80\x94thine is Tyros.) The\r\n  dream, indeed, is so intimately connected with verbal expression that\r\n  Ferenczi[87] may justly remark that every tongue has its own dream\r\n  language. Dreams are, as a rule, not translatable into other\r\n  languages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFootnote T:\r\n\r\n  Breuer and Freud, _Studien \xc3\xbcber Hysterie_, Vienna, 1895; 2nd ed. 1909.\r\n\r\nFootnote U:\r\n\r\n  The complaint, as yet unexplained, of pains in the abdomen, may also\r\n  be referred to this third person. It is my own wife, of course, who is\r\n  in question; the abdominal pains remind me of one of the occasions\r\n  upon which her shyness became evident to me. I must myself admit that\r\n  I do not treat Irma and my wife very gallantly in this dream, but let\r\n  it be said for my excuse that I am judging both of them by the\r\n  standard of the courageous, docile, female patient.\r\n\r\nFootnote V:\r\n\r\n  I suspect that the interpretation of this portion has not been carried\r\n  far enough to follow every hidden meaning. If I were to continue the\r\n  comparison of the three women, I would go far afield. Every dream has\r\n  at least one point at which it is unfathomable, a central point, as it\r\n  were, connecting it with the unknown.\r\n\r\nFootnote W:\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cAnanas,\xe2\x80\x9d moreover, has a remarkable assonance to the family name of\r\n  my patient Irma.\r\n\r\nFootnote X:\r\n\r\n  In this the dream did not turn out to be prophetic. But in another\r\n  sense, it proved correct, for the \xe2\x80\x9cunsolved\xe2\x80\x9d stomach pains, for which\r\n  I did not want to be to blame, were the forerunners of a serious\r\n  illness caused by gall stones.\r\n\r\nFootnote Y:\r\n\r\n  Even if I have not, as may be understood, given account of everything\r\n  which occurred to me in connection with the work of interpretation.\r\n\r\nFootnote Z:\r\n\r\n  The facts about dreams of thirst were known also to Weygandt,[75] who\r\n  expresses himself about them (p. 11) as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is just the\r\n  sensation of thirst which is most accurately registered of all; it\r\n  always causes a representation of thirst quenching. The manner in\r\n  which the dream pictures the act of thirst quenching is manifold, and\r\n  is especially apt to be formed according to a recent reminiscence.\r\n  Here also a universal phenomenon is that disappointment in the slight\r\n  efficacy of the supposed refreshments sets in immediately after the\r\n  idea that thirst has been quenched.\xe2\x80\x9d But he overlooks the fact that\r\n  the reaction of the dream to the stimulus is universal. If other\r\n  persons who are troubled by thirst at night awake without dreaming\r\n  beforehand, this does not constitute an objection to my experiment,\r\n  but characterises those others as persons who sleep poorly.\r\n\r\nFootnote AA:\r\n\r\n  The dream afterwards accomplished the same purpose in the case of the\r\n  grandmother, who is older than the child by about seventy years, as it\r\n  did in the case of the granddaughter. After she had been forced to go\r\n  hungry for several days on account of the restlessness of her floating\r\n  kidney, she dreamed, apparently with a transference into the happy\r\n  time of her flowering maidenhood, that she had been \xe2\x80\x9casked out,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n  invited as a guest for both the important meals, and each time had\r\n  been served with the most delicious morsels.\r\n\r\nFootnote AB:\r\n\r\n  A more searching investigation into the psychic life of the child\r\n  teaches us, to be sure, that sexual motive powers in infantile forms,\r\n  which have been too long overlooked, play a sufficiently great part in\r\n  the psychic activity of the child. This raises some doubt as to the\r\n  happiness of the child, as imagined later by the adults. _Cf._ the\r\n  author\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThree Contributions to the Sexual Theory,\xe2\x80\x9d translated by A.\r\n  A. Brill, _Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases_ Publishing Company.\r\n\r\nFootnote AC:\r\n\r\n  It should not be left unmentioned that children sometimes show complex\r\n  and more obscure dreams, while, on the other hand, adults will often\r\n  under certain conditions show dreams of an infantile character. How\r\n  rich in unsuspected material the dreams of children of from four to\r\n  five years might be is shown by examples in my \xe2\x80\x9cAnalyse der Phobie\r\n  eines f\xc3\xbcnfj\xc3\xa4hrigen Knaben\xe2\x80\x9d (_Jahrbuch_, ed. by Bleuler & Freud, 1909),\r\n  and in Jung\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cUeber Konflikte der kindlichen Seele\xe2\x80\x9d (ebda. ii. vol.,\r\n  1910). On the other hand, it seems that dreams of an infantile type\r\n  reappear especially often in adults if they are transferred to unusual\r\n  conditions of life. Thus Otto Nordenskjold, in his book _Antarctic_\r\n  (1904), writes as follows about the crew who passed the winter with\r\n  him. \xe2\x80\x9cVery characteristic for the trend of our inmost thoughts were\r\n  our dreams, which were never more vivid and numerous than at present.\r\n  Even those of our comrades with whom dreaming had formerly been an\r\n  exception had long stories to tell in the morning when we exchanged\r\n  our experiences in the world of phantasies. They all referred to that\r\n  outer world which was now so far from us, but they often fitted into\r\n  our present relations. An especially characteristic dream was the one\r\n  in which one of our comrades believed himself back on the bench at\r\n  school, where the task was assigned him of skinning miniature seals\r\n  which were especially made for the purposes of instruction. Eating and\r\n  drinking formed the central point around which most of our dreams were\r\n  grouped. One of us, who was fond of going to big dinner parties at\r\n  night, was exceedingly glad if he could report in the morning \xe2\x80\x98that he\r\n  had had a dinner consisting of three courses.\xe2\x80\x99 Another dreamed of\r\n  tobacco\xe2\x80\x94of whole mountains of tobacco; still another dreamed of a ship\r\n  approaching on the open sea under full sail. Still another dream\r\n  deserves to be mentioned. The letter carrier brought the mail, and\r\n  gave a long explanation of why he had had to wait so long for it; he\r\n  had delivered it at the wrong place, and only after great effort had\r\n  been able to get it back. To be sure, we occupied ourselves in sleep\r\n  with still more impossible things, but the lack of phantasy in almost\r\n  all the dreams which I myself dreamed or heard others relate was quite\r\n  striking. It would surely have been of great psychological interest if\r\n  all the dreams could have been noted. But one can readily understand\r\n  how we longed for sleep. It alone could afford us everything that we\r\n  all most ardently desired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFootnote AD:\r\n\r\n  A Hungarian proverb referred to by Ferenczi[87] states more explicitly\r\n  that \xe2\x80\x9cthe pig dreams of acorns, the goose of maize.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFootnote AE:\r\n\r\n  It is quite incredible with what stubbornness readers and critics\r\n  exclude this consideration, and leave unheeded the fundamental\r\n  differentiation between the manifest and the latent dream content.\r\n\r\nFootnote AF:\r\n\r\n  It is remarkable how my memory narrows here for the purposes of\r\n  analysis\xe2\x80\x94while I am awake. I have known five of my uncles, and have\r\n  loved and honoured one of them. But at the moment when I overcame my\r\n  resistance to the interpretation of the dream I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\n  have only one uncle, the one who is intended in the dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFootnote AG:\r\n\r\n  The word is here used in the original Latin sense _instantia_, meaning\r\n  energy, continuance or persistence in doing. (Translator.)\r\n\r\nFootnote AH:\r\n\r\n  Such hypocritical dreams are not unusual occurrences with me or with\r\n  others. While I am working up a certain scientific problem, I am\r\n  visited for many nights in rapid succession by a somewhat confusing\r\n  dream which has as its content reconciliation with a friend long ago\r\n  dropped. After three or four attempts, I finally succeeded in grasping\r\n  the meaning of this dream. It was in the nature of an encouragement to\r\n  give up the little consideration still left for the person in\r\n  question, to drop him completely, but it disguised itself shamefacedly\r\n  in the opposite feeling. I have reported a \xe2\x80\x9chypocritical Oedipus\r\n  dream\xe2\x80\x9d of a person, in which the hostile feelings and the wishes of\r\n  death of the dream thoughts were replaced by manifest tenderness.\r\n  (\xe2\x80\x9cTypisches Beispiel eines verkappten Oedipustraumes,\xe2\x80\x9d _Zentralblatt\r\n  f\xc3\xbcr Psychoanalyse_, Bd. 1, Heft 1\xe2\x80\x9311, 1910.)

If these passages are\r\n  capable of throwing light upon the intimate relations between the\r\n  dream and the psychoneuroses, they have served the purpose for which I\r\n  have taken them up.\r\n\r\nFootnote AK:\r\n\r\n  Something like the smoked salmon in the dream of the deferred supper.\r\n\r\nFootnote AL:\r\n\r\n  It often happens that a dream is told incompletely, and that a\r\n  recollection of the omitted portions appears only in the course of the\r\n  analysis. These portions subsequently fitted in, regularly furnish the\r\n  key to the interpretation. _Cf._ below, about forgetting in dreams.\r\n\r\nFootnote AM:\r\n\r\n  Similar \xe2\x80\x9ccounter wish-dreams\xe2\x80\x9d have been repeatedly reported to me\r\n  within the last few years by my pupils who thus reacted to their first\r\n  encounter with the \xe2\x80\x9cwish theory of the dream.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFootnote AN:\r\n\r\n  We may mention here the simplification and modification of this\r\n  fundamental formula, propounded by Otto Rank: \xe2\x80\x9cOn the basis and with\r\n  the help of repressed infantile sexual material, the dream regularly\r\n  represents as fulfilled actual, and as a rule also erotic, wishes, in\r\n  a disguised and symbolic form.\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cEin Traum, der sich selbst deutet,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n  _Jahrbuch_, v., Bleuler-Freud, II.

The\r\n  conclusion would have to be drawn that the dream ordinarily performs\r\n  very inadequately the duty which is prescribed for it.\r\n\r\nFootnote AQ:\r\n\r\n  As mentioned in the first chapter, p. 67, H. Swoboda applies broadly\r\n  to the psychic activity, the biological intervals of twenty-three and\r\n  twenty-eight days discovered by W. Fliess, and lays especial emphasis\r\n  upon the fact that these periods are determinant for the appearance of\r\n  the dream elements in dreams. There would be no material change in\r\n  dream interpretation if this could be proven, but it would result in a\r\n  new source for the origin of the dream material. I have recently\r\n  undertaken some examination of my own dreams in order to test the\r\n  applicability of the \xe2\x80\x9cPeriod Theory\xe2\x80\x9d to the dream material, and I have\r\n  selected for this purpose especially striking elements of the dream\r\n  content, whose origin could be definitely ascertained:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n                    I.\xe2\x80\x94_Dream from October 1\xe2\x80\x932, 1910_\r\n\r\n  (Fragment).... Somewhere in Italy. Three daughters show me small\r\n  costly objects, as if in an antiquity shop. At the same time they sit\r\n  down on my lap. Of one of the pieces I remark: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you got this from\r\n  me.\xe2\x80\x9d I also see distinctly a small profile mask with the angular\r\n  features of Savonarola.\r\n\r\n  When have I last seen a picture of Savonarola? According to my\r\n  travelling diary, I was in Florence on the fourth and fifth of\r\n  September, and while there thought of showing my travelling companion\r\n  the plaster medallion of the features of the fanatical monk in the\r\n  Piazza Signoria, the same place where he met his death by burning. I\r\n  believe that I called his attention to it at 3 A.M. To be sure, from\r\n  this impression, until its return in the dream, there was an interval\r\n  of twenty-seven and one days\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cfeminine period,\xe2\x80\x9d according to Fliess.\r\n  But, unfortunately for the demonstrative force of this example, I must\r\n  add that on the very day of the dream I was visited (the first time\r\n  after my return) by the able but melancholy-looking colleague whom I\r\n  had already years before nicknamed \xe2\x80\x9cRabbi Savonarola.\xe2\x80\x9d He brought me a\r\n  patient who had met with an accident on the Pottebba railroad, on\r\n  which I had myself travelled eight days before, and my thoughts were\r\n  thus turned to my last Italian journey. The appearance in the dream\r\n  content of the striking element of Savonarola is explained by the\r\n  visit of my colleague on the day of the dream; the twenty-eight day\r\n  interval had no significance in its origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      II.\xe2\x80\x94_Dream from October 10\xe2\x80\x9311_\r\n\r\n  I am again studying chemistry in the University laboratory. Court\r\n  Councillor L. invites me to come to another place, and walks before me\r\n  in the corridor carrying in front of him in his uplifted hand a lamp\r\n  or some other instrument, and assuming a peculiar attitude, his head\r\n  stretched forward. We then come to an open space ... (rest forgotten).\r\n\r\n  In this dream content, the most striking part is the manner in which\r\n  Court Councillor L. carries the lamp (or lupe) in front of him, his\r\n  gaze directed into the distance. I have not seen L. for many years,\r\n  but I now know that he is only a substitute for another greater\r\n  person\xe2\x80\x94for Archimedes near the Arethusa fountain in Syracuse, who\r\n  stands there exactly like L. in the dream, holding the burning mirror\r\n  and gazing at the besieging army of the Romans. When had I first (and\r\n  last) seen this monument? According to my notes, it was on the\r\n  seventeenth day of September, in the evening, and from this date to\r\n  the dream there really passed 13 and 10, equals 23, days-according to\r\n  Fliess, a \xe2\x80\x9cmasculine period.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  But I regret to say that here, too, this connection seems somewhat\r\n  less inevitable when we enter into the interpretation of this dream.\r\n  The dream was occasioned by the information, received on the day of\r\n  the dream, that the lecture-room in the clinic in which I was invited\r\n  to deliver my lectures had been changed to some other place. I took it\r\n  for granted that the new room was very inconveniently situated, and\r\n  said to myself, it is as bad as not having any lecture-room at my\r\n  disposal. My thoughts must have then taken me back to the time when I\r\n  first became a docent, when I really had no lecture-room, and when, in\r\n  my efforts to get one, I met with little encouragement from the very\r\n  influential gentlemen councillors and professors. In my distress at\r\n  that time, I appealed to L., who then had the title of dean, and whom\r\n  I considered kindly disposed. He promised to help me, but that was all\r\n  I ever heard from him. In the dream he is the Archimedes, who gives me\r\n  the \xcf\x80\xe1\xbd\xb5\xcf\x83\xcf\x84\xcf\x89 and leads me into the other room. That neither the desire\r\n  for revenge nor the consciousness of one\xe2\x80\x99s own importance is absent in\r\n  this dream will be readily divined by those familiar with dream\r\n  interpretation. I must conclude, however, that without this motive for\r\n  the dream, Archimedes would hardly have got into the dream that night.\r\n  I am not certain whether the strong and still recent impression of the\r\n  statue in Syracuse did not also come to the surface at a different\r\n  interval of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   III.\xe2\x80\x94_Dream from October 2\xe2\x80\x933, 1910._\r\n\r\n  (Fragment) ... Something about Professor Oser, who himself prepared\r\n  the menu for me, which served to restore me to great peace of mind\r\n  (rest forgotten).\r\n\r\n  The dream was a reaction to the digestive disturbances of this day,\r\n  which made me consider asking one of my colleagues to arrange a diet\r\n  for me. That in the dream I selected for this purpose Professor Oser,\r\n  who had died in the summer, is based on the recent death (October 1)\r\n  of another university teacher, whom I highly revered. But when did\r\n  Oser die, and when did I hear of his death? According to the newspaper\r\n  notice, he died on the 22nd of August, but as I was at the time in\r\n  Holland, whither my Vienna newspapers were regularly sent me, I must\r\n  have read the obituary notice on the 24th or 25th of August. This\r\n  interval no longer corresponds to any period. It takes in 7 and 30 and\r\n  2, equals 39, days, or perhaps 38 days. I cannot recall having spoken\r\n  or thought of Oser during this interval.\r\n\r\n  Such intervals as were not available for the \xe2\x80\x9cperiod theory\xe2\x80\x9d without\r\n  further elaboration, were shown from my dreams to be far more frequent\r\n  than the regular ones. As maintained in the text, the only thing\r\n  constantly found is the relation to an impression of the day of the\r\n  dream itself.\r\n\r\nFootnote AR:\r\n\r\n  _Cf._ my essay, \xe2\x80\x9cUeber Deckerinnerungen,\xe2\x80\x9d in the _Monatsschrift f\xc3\xbcr\r\n  Psychiatrie und Neurologie_, 1899.\r\n\r\nFootnote AS:\r\n\r\n  Ger., _bl\xc3\xbchend_.\r\n\r\nFootnote AT:\r\n\r\n  The tendency of the dream function to fuse everything of interest\r\n  which is present into simultaneous treatment has already been noticed\r\n  by several authors, for instance, by Delage,[15] p. 41, Delb\xc5\x93uf,[16]\r\n  _Rapprochement Forc\xc3\xa9_, p. 236.\r\n\r\nFootnote AU:\r\n\r\n  The dream of Irma\xe2\x80\x99s injection; the dream of the friend who is my\r\n  uncle.\r\n\r\nFootnote AV:\r\n\r\n  The dream of the funeral oration of the young physician.\r\n\r\nFootnote AW:\r\n\r\n  The dream of the botanical monograph.\r\n\r\nFootnote AX:\r\n\r\n  The dreams of my patients during analysis are mostly of this kind.\r\n\r\nFootnote AY:\r\n\r\n  _Cf._ Chap.

The\r\n  reputation of the young woman never suffers on account of _fensterln_,\r\n  unless she becomes intimate with too many suitors. (Translator.)\r\n\r\nFootnote BF:\r\n\r\n  Both the emotions which belong to these childish scenes\xe2\x80\x94astonishment\r\n  and resignation to the inevitable\xe2\x80\x94had appeared in a dream shortly\r\n  before, which was the first thing that brought back the memory of this\r\n  childhood experience.\r\n\r\nFootnote BG:\r\n\r\n  I do not elaborate plagiostomi purposely; they recall an occasion of\r\n  angry disgrace before the same teacher.\r\n\r\nFootnote BH:\r\n\r\n  _Cf._ Maury\xe2\x80\x99s dream about kilo-lotto, p. 50.\r\n\r\nFootnote BI:\r\n\r\n  Popo = backside in German nursery language.\r\n\r\nFootnote BJ:\r\n\r\n  This repetition has insinuated itself into the text of the dream\r\n  apparently through my absent-mindedness, and I allow it to remain\r\n  because the analysis shows that it has its significance.\r\n\r\nFootnote BK:\r\n\r\n  Not in _Germinal_, but in _La Terre_\xe2\x80\x94a mistake of which I became aware\r\n  only in the analysis. I may call attention also to the identity of the\r\n  letters in _Huflattich_ and _Flatus_.\r\n\r\nFootnote BL:\r\n\r\n  Translator\xe2\x80\x99s note.\r\n\r\nFootnote BM:\r\n\r\n  In his significant work (\xe2\x80\x9cPhantasie und Mythos,\xe2\x80\x9d _Jahrbuch f\xc3\xbcr\r\n  Psychoanalyse_, Bd. ii., 1910), H. Silberer has endeavoured to show\r\n  from this part of the dream that the dream-work is able to reproduce\r\n  not only the latent dream thoughts, but also the psychic processes in\r\n  the dream formation (\xe2\x80\x9cDas functionale Ph\xc3\xa4nomen\xe2\x80\x9d).\r\n\r\nFootnote BN:\r\n\r\n  Another interpretation: He is one-eyed like Odin, the father of the\r\n  gods ... Odin\xe2\x80\x99s consolation. The consolation in the childish scene,\r\n  that I will buy him a new bed.\r\n\r\nFootnote BO:\r\n\r\n  I here add some material for interpretation. Holding the urinal\r\n  recalls the story of a peasant who tries one glass after another at\r\n  the opticians, but still cannot read (peasant-catcher, like\r\n  girl-catcher in a portion of the dream). The treatment among the\r\n  peasants of the father who has become weak-minded in Zola\xe2\x80\x99s _La\r\n  Terre_. The pathetic atonement that in his last days the father soils\r\n  his bed like a child; hence, also, I am his sick-attendant in the\r\n  dream. Thinking and experiencing are here, as it were; the same thing\r\n  recalls a highly revolutionary closet drama by Oscar Panizza, in which\r\n  the Godhead is treated quite contemptuously, as though he were a\r\n  paralytic old man. There occurs a passage: \xe2\x80\x9cWill and deed are the same\r\n  thing with him, and he must be prevented by his archangel, a kind of\r\n  Ganymede, from scolding and swearing, because these curses would\r\n  immediately be fulfilled.\xe2\x80\x9d Making plans is a reproach against my\r\n  father, dating from a later period in the development of my critical\r\n  faculty; just as the whole rebellious, sovereign-offending dream, with\r\n  its scoff at high authority, originates in a revolt against my father.\r\n  The sovereign is called father of the land (_Landesvater_), and the\r\n  father is the oldest, first and only authority for the child, from the\r\n  absolutism of which the other social authorities have developed in the\r\n  course of the history of human civilisation (in so far as the\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cmother\xe2\x80\x99s right\xe2\x80\x9d does not force a qualification of this thesis). The\r\n  idea in the dream, \xe2\x80\x9cthinking and experiencing are the same thing,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n  refers to the explanation of hysterical symptoms, to which the male\r\n  urinal (glass) also has a relation. I need not explain the principle\r\n  of the \xe2\x80\x9cGschnas\xe2\x80\x9d to a Viennese; it consists in constructing objects of\r\n  rare and costly appearance out of trifles, and preferably out of\r\n  comical and worthless material\xe2\x80\x94for example, making suits of armour out\r\n  of cooking utensils, sticks and \xe2\x80\x9csalzstangeln\xe2\x80\x9d (elongated rolls), as\r\n  our artists like to do at their jolly parties. I had now learned that\r\n  hysterical subjects do the same thing; besides what has actually\r\n  occurred to them, they unconsciously conceive horrible or extravagant\r\n  fantastic images, which they construct from the most harmless and\r\n  commonplace things they have experienced. The symptoms depend solely\r\n  upon these phantasies, not upon the memory of their real experiences,\r\n  be they serious or harmless. This explanation helped me to overcome\r\n  many difficulties and gave me much pleasure. I was able to allude to\r\n  it in the dream element \xe2\x80\x9cmale urinal\xe2\x80\x9d (glass) because I had been told\r\n  that at the last \xe2\x80\x9cGschnas\xe2\x80\x9d evening a poison chalice of Lucretia Borgia\r\n  had been exhibited, the chief constituent of which had consisted of a\r\n  glass urinal for men, such as is used in hospitals.\r\n\r\nFootnote BP:\r\n\r\n  _Cf._ the passage in Griesinger[31] and the remarks in my second essay\r\n  on the \xe2\x80\x9cdefence-neuropsychoses\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Selected Papers on Hysteria_,\r\n  translated by A.

In _Oedipus_ the basic wish-phantasy of the child is brought\r\n  to light and realised as it is in the dream; in _Hamlet_ it remains\r\n  repressed, and we learn of its existence\xe2\x80\x94somewhat as in the case of a\r\n  neurosis\xe2\x80\x94only by the inhibition which results from it. The fact that\r\n  it is possible to remain in complete darkness concerning the character\r\n  of the hero, has curiously shown itself to be consistent with the\r\n  overpowering effect of the modern drama. The play is based upon\r\n  Hamlet\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation to accomplish the avenging task which has been\r\n  assigned to him; the text does not avow the reasons or motives of this\r\n  hesitation, nor have the numerous attempts at interpretation succeeded\r\n  in giving them. According to the conception which is still current\r\n  to-day, and which goes back to Goethe, Hamlet represents the type of\r\n  man whose prime energy is paralysed by over-development of thought\r\n  activity. (\xe2\x80\x9cSicklied o\xe2\x80\x99er with the pale cast of thought.\xe2\x80\x9d) According\r\n  to others the poet has attempted to portray a morbid, vacillating\r\n  character who is subject to neurasthenia. The plot of the story,\r\n  however, teaches us that Hamlet is by no means intended to appear as a\r\n  person altogether incapable of action. Twice we see him asserting\r\n  himself actively, once in headlong passion, where he stabs the\r\n  eavesdropper behind the arras, and on another occasion where he sends\r\n  the two courtiers to the death which has been intended for\r\n  himself\xe2\x80\x94doing this deliberately, even craftily, and with all the lack\r\n  of compunction of a prince of the Renaissance. What is it, then, that\r\n  restrains him in the accomplishment of the task which his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n  ghost has set before him? Here the explanation offers itself that it\r\n  is the peculiar nature of this task. Hamlet can do everything but take\r\n  vengeance upon the man who has put his father out of the way, and has\r\n  taken his father\xe2\x80\x99s place with his mother\xe2\x80\x94upon the man who shows him\r\n  the realisation of his repressed childhood wishes. The loathing which\r\n  ought to drive him to revenge is thus replaced in him by\r\n  self-reproaches, by conscientious scruples, which represent to him\r\n  that he himself is no better than the murderer whom he is to punish. I\r\n  have thus translated into consciousness what had to remain unconscious\r\n  in the mind of the hero; if some one wishes to call Hamlet a hysteric\r\n  subject I cannot but recognise it as an inference from my\r\n  interpretation. The sexual disinclination which Hamlet expresses in\r\n  conversation with Ophelia, coincides very well with this view\xe2\x80\x94it is\r\n  the same sexual disinclination which was to take possession of the\r\n  poet more and more during the next few years of his life, until the\r\n  climax of it is expressed in _Timon of Athens_. Of course it can only\r\n  be the poet\xe2\x80\x99s own psychology with which we are confronted in _Hamlet_;\r\n  from a work on Shakespeare by George Brandes (1896), I take the fact\r\n  that the drama was composed immediately after the death of\r\n  Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s father\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, in the midst of recent mourning\r\n  for him\xe2\x80\x94during the revival, we may assume, of his childhood emotion\r\n  towards his father. It is also known that a son of Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s, who\r\n  died early, bore the name of Hamnet (identical with Hamlet). Just as\r\n  _Hamlet_ treats of the relation of the son to his parents, _Macbeth_,\r\n  which appears subsequently, is based upon the theme of childlessness.\r\n  Just as every neurotic symptom, just as the dream itself, is capable\r\n  of re-interpretation, and even requires it in order to be perfectly\r\n  intelligible, so every genuine poetical creation must have proceeded\r\n  from more than one motive, more than one impulse in the mind of the\r\n  poet, and must admit of more than one interpretation. I have here\r\n  attempted to interpret only the most profound group of impulses in the\r\n  mind of the creative poet. The conception of the _Hamlet_ problem\r\n  contained in these remarks has been later confirmed in a detailed work\r\n  based on many new arguments by Dr. Ernest Jones, of Toronto (Canada).\r\n  The connection of the _Hamlet_ material with the \xe2\x80\x9cMythus von der\r\n  Geburt des Helden\xe2\x80\x9d has also been demonstrated by O. Rank.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\n  _Oedipus_ Complex as an Explanation of _Hamlet\xe2\x80\x99s_ Mystery: a Study in\r\n  Motive\xe2\x80\x9d (_American Journal of Psychology_, January 1910, vol. xxi.).\r\n\r\nFootnote CE:\r\n\r\n  Likewise, anything large, over-abundant, enormous, and exaggerated,\r\n  may be a childish characteristic. The child knows no more intense wish\r\n  than to become big, and to receive as much of everything as grown-ups;\r\n  the child is hard to satisfy; it knows no _enough_, and insatiably\r\n  demands the repetition of whatever has pleased it or tasted good to\r\n  it. It learns to practise moderation, to be modest and resigned, only\r\n  through culture and education. As is well known, the neurotic is also\r\n  inclined toward immoderation and excess.\r\n\r\nFootnote CF:\r\n\r\n  While Dr. Jones was delivering a lecture before an American scientific\r\n  society, and speaking of egotism in dreams, a learned lady took\r\n  exception to this unscientific generalisation. She thought that the\r\n  lecturer could only pronounce such judgment on the dreams of\r\n  Austrians, and had no right to include the dreams of Americans. As for\r\n  herself she was sure that all her dreams were strictly altruistic.\r\n\r\nFootnote CG:\r\n\r\n  According to C. G. Jung, dreams of dental irritation in the case of\r\n  women have the significance of parturition dreams.\r\n\r\nFootnote CH:\r\n\r\n  _Cf._ the \xe2\x80\x9cbiographic\xe2\x80\x9d dream on p. 235.\r\n\r\nFootnote CI:\r\n\r\n  As the dreams of pulling teeth, and teeth falling out, are interpreted\r\n  in popular belief to mean the death of a close friend, and as\r\n  psychoanalysis can at most only admit of such a meaning in the above\r\n  indicated parodical sense, I insert here a dream of dental irritation\r\n  placed at my disposal by Otto Rank[109].\r\n\r\n  Upon the subject of dreams of dental irritation I have received the\r\n  following report from a colleague who has for some time taken a lively\r\n  interest in the problems of dream interpretation:\r\n\r\n  _I recently dreamed that I went to the dentist who drilled out one of\r\n  my back teeth in the lower jaw. He worked so long at it that the tooth\r\n  became useless. He then grasped it with the forceps, and pulled it out\r\n  with such perfect ease that it astonished me. He said that I should\r\n  not care about it, as this was not really the tooth that had been\r\n  treated; and he put it on the table where the tooth (as it seems to me\r\n  now an upper incisor) fell apart into many strata. I arose from the\r\n  operating chair, stepped inquisitively nearer, and, full of interest,\r\n  put a medical question. While the doctor separated the individual\r\n  pieces of the strikingly white tooth and ground them up (pulverised\r\n  them) with an instrument, he explained to me that this had some\r\n  connection with puberty, and that the teeth come out so easily only\r\n  before puberty; the decisive moment for this in women is the birth of\r\n  a child. I then noticed (as I believe half awake) that this dream was\r\n  accompanied by a pollution which I cannot however definitely place at\r\n  a particular point in the dream; I am inclined to think that it began\r\n  with the pulling out of the tooth._\r\n\r\n  _I then continued to dream something which I can no longer remember,\r\n  which ended with the fact that I had left my hat and coat somewhere\r\n  (perhaps at the dentist\xe2\x80\x99s), hoping that they would be brought after\r\n  me, and dressed only in my overcoat I hastened to catch a departing\r\n  train. I succeeded at the last moment in jumping upon the last car,\r\n  where someone was already standing. I could not, however, get inside\r\n  the car, but was compelled to make the journey in an uncomfortable\r\n  position, from which I attempted to escape with final success. We\r\n  journeyed through a long tunnel, in which two trains from the opposite\r\n  direction passed through our own train as if it were a tunnel. I\r\n  looked in as from the outside through a car window._\r\n\r\n  As material for the interpretation of this dream, we obtained the\r\n  following experiences and thoughts of the dreamer:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  I. For a short time I had actually been under dental treatment, and at\r\n  the time of the dream I was suffering from continual pains in the\r\n  tooth of my lower jaw, which was drilled out in the dream, and on\r\n  which the dentist had in fact worked longer than I liked. On the\r\n  forenoon of the day of the dream I had again gone to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s on\r\n  account of the pain, and he had suggested that I should allow him to\r\n  pull out another tooth than the one treated in the same jaw, from\r\n  which the pain probably came. It was a \xe2\x80\x98wisdom tooth\xe2\x80\x99 which was just\r\n  breaking through. On this occasion, and in this connection, I had put\r\n  a question to his conscience as a physician.\r\n\r\n  II. On the afternoon of the same day I was obliged to excuse myself to\r\n  a lady for my irritable disposition on account of the toothache, upon\r\n  which she told me that she was afraid to have one of her roots pulled,\r\n  though the crown was almost completely gone. She thought that the\r\n  pulling out of eye teeth was especially painful and dangerous,\r\n  although some acquaintance had told her that this was much easier when\r\n  it was a tooth of the lower jaw. It was such a tooth in her case. The\r\n  same acquaintance also told her that while under an an\xc3\xa6sthetic one of\r\n  her false teeth had been pulled\xe2\x80\x94a statement which increased her fear\r\n  of the necessary operation. She then asked me whether by eye teeth one\r\n  was to understand molars or canines, and what was known about them. I\r\n  then called her attention to the vein of superstitions in all these\r\n  meanings, without however, emphasising the real significance of some\r\n  of the popular views. She knew from her own experience, a very old and\r\n  general popular belief, according to which _if a pregnant woman has\r\n  toothache she will give birth to a boy_.\r\n\r\n  III. This saying interested me in its relation to the typical\r\n  significance of dreams of dental irritation as a substitute for\r\n  onanism as maintained by Freud in his _Traumdeutung_ (2nd edition, p.\r\n  193), for the teeth and the male genital (Bub-boy) are brought in\r\n  certain relations even in the popular saying. On the evening of the\r\n  same day I therefore read the passage in question in the\r\n  _Traumdeutung_, and found there among other things the statements\r\n  which will be quoted in a moment, the influence of which on my dream\r\n  is as plainly recognisable as the influence of the two above-mentioned\r\n  experiences. Freud writes concerning dreams of dental irritation that\r\n  \xe2\x80\x98in the case of men nothing else than cravings for masturbation from\r\n  the time of puberty furnishes the motive power for these dreams,\xe2\x80\x99 p.\r\n  193. Further, \xe2\x80\x98I am of the opinion that the frequent modifications of\r\n  the typical dream of dental irritation\xe2\x80\x94that _e.g._ of another person\r\n  drawing the tooth from the dreamer\xe2\x80\x99s mouth\xe2\x80\x94are made intelligible by\r\n  means of the same explanation. It may seem problematic, however, how\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cdental irritation\xe2\x80\x9d can arrive at this significance. I here call\r\n  attention to the transference from below to above (in the dream in\r\n  question from the lower to the upper jaw), which occurs so frequently,\r\n  which is at the service of sexual repression, and by means of which\r\n  all kinds of sensations and intentions occurring in hysteria which\r\n  ought to be enacted in the genitals can be realised upon less\r\n  objectionable parts of the body,\xe2\x80\x99 p. 194. \xe2\x80\x98But I must also refer to\r\n  another connection contained in an idiomatic expression. In our\r\n  country there is in use an indelicate designation for the act of\r\n  masturbation, namely: To pull one out, or to pull one down,\xe2\x80\x99 p. 195,\r\n  2nd edition. This expression had been familiar to me in early youth as\r\n  a designation for onanism, and from here on it will not be difficult\r\n  for the experienced dream interpreter to get access to the infantile\r\n  material which may lie at the basis of this dream. I only wish to add\r\n  that the facility with which the tooth in the dream came out, and the\r\n  fact that it became transformed after coming out into an upper\r\n  incisor, recalls to me an experience of childhood when I myself easily\r\n  and painlessly pulled out one of my wobbling front teeth. This\r\n  episode, which I can still to this day distinctly remember with all\r\n  its details, happened at the same early period in which my first\r\n  conscious attempts at onanism began\xe2\x80\x94(Concealing Memory). The reference\r\n  of Freud to an assertion of C. G. Jung that dreams of dental\r\n  irritation in women signify parturition (footnote p. 194), together\r\n  with the popular belief in the significance of toothache in pregnant\r\n  women, has established an opposition between the feminine significance\r\n  and the masculine (puberty). In this connection I recall an earlier\r\n  dream which I dreamed soon after I was discharged by the dentist after\r\n  the treatment, that the gold crowns which had just been put in fell\r\n  out, whereupon I was greatly chagrined in the dream on account of the\r\n  considerable expense, concerning which I had not yet stopped worrying.\r\n  In view of a certain experience this dream now becomes comprehensible\r\n  as a commendation of the material advantages of masturbation when\r\n  contrasted with every form of the economically less advantageous\r\n  object-love (gold crowns are also Austrian gold coins).\r\n\r\n  Theoretically this case seems to show a double interest. First it\r\n  verifies the connection revealed by Freud, inasmuch as the ejaculation\r\n  in the dream takes place during the act of tooth-pulling. For no\r\n  matter in what form a pollution may appear, we are obliged to look\r\n  upon it as a masturbatic gratification which takes place without the\r\n  help of mechanical excitation. Moreover the gratification by pollution\r\n  in this case does not take place, as is usually the case, through an\r\n  imaginary object, but it is without an object; and, if one may be\r\n  allowed to say so, it is purely autoerotic, or at most it perhaps\r\n  shows a slight homosexual thread (the dentist).\r\n\r\n  The second point which seems to be worth mentioning is the following:\r\n  The objection is quite obvious that we are seeking here to validate\r\n  the Freudian conception in a quite superfluous manner, for the\r\n  experiences of the reading itself are perfectly sufficient to explain\r\n  to us the content of the dream. The visit to the dentist, the\r\n  conversation with the lady, and the reading of the _Traumdeutung_ are\r\n  sufficient to explain why the sleeper, who was also disturbed during\r\n  the night by toothache, should dream this dream, it may even explain\r\n  the removal of the sleep-disturbing pain (by means of the presentation\r\n  of the removal of the painful tooth and simultaneous over-accentuation\r\n  of the dreaded painful sensation through libido). But no matter how\r\n  much of this assumption we may admit, we cannot earnestly maintain\r\n  that the readings of Freud\xe2\x80\x99s explanations have produced in the dreamer\r\n  the connection of the tooth-pulling with the act of masturbation; it\r\n  could not even have been made effective had it not been for the fact,\r\n  as the dreamer himself admitted (\xe2\x80\x98to pull one off\xe2\x80\x99) that this\r\n  association had already been formed long ago. What may have still more\r\n  stimulated this association in connection with the conversation with\r\n  the lady is shown by a later assertion of the dreamer that while\r\n  reading the _Traumdeutung_ he could not, for obvious reasons, believe\r\n  in this typical meaning of dreams of dental irritation, and\r\n  entertained the wish to know whether it held true for all dreams of\r\n  this nature. The dream now confirms this at least for his own person,\r\n  and shows him why he had to doubt it. The dream is therefore also in\r\n  this respect the fulfilment of a wish; namely, to be convinced of the\r\n  importance and stability of this conception of Freud.\r\n\r\nFootnote CJ:\r\n\r\n  A young colleague, who is entirely free from nervousness, tells me in\r\n  this connection: \xe2\x80\x9cI know from my own experience that while swinging,\r\n  and at the moment at which the downward movement had the greatest\r\n  impetus, I used to get a curious feeling in my genitals, which I must\r\n  designate, although it was not really pleasant to me, as a voluptuous\r\n  feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d I have often heard from patients that their first erections\r\n  accompanied by voluptuous sensations had occurred in boyhood while\r\n  they were climbing. It is established with complete certainty by\r\n  psychoanalyses that the first sexual impulses have often originated in\r\n  the scufflings and wrestlings of childhood.\r\n\r\nFootnote CK:\r\n\r\n  This naturally holds true only for German-speaking dreamers who are\r\n  acquainted with the vulgarism \xe2\x80\x9c_v\xc3\xb6geln_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFootnote CL:\r\n\r\n  _Sammlung kl.

Rank,[108] p. 534);\r\n  thus a dream of sexual relations with the mother has been transmitted\r\n  to us by Julius C\xc3\xa6sar which the oneiroscopists interpreted as a\r\n  favourable omen for taking possession of the earth (Mother-earth). It\r\n  is also known that the oracle declared to the Tarquinii that that one\r\n  of them would become ruler of Rome who should first kiss the mother\r\n  (_osculum, matri tulerit_), which Brutus conceived as referring to the\r\n  mother-earth (_terram osculo contigit, scilicet quod ea communia mater\r\n  omnium mortalium esset_, Livius, I., lxi.). These myths and\r\n  interpretations point to a correct psychological knowledge. I have\r\n  found that persons who consider themselves preferred or favoured by\r\n  their mothers manifest in life that confidence in themselves and that\r\n  firm optimism which often seems heroic and brings about real success\r\n  by force.\r\n\r\nFootnote CQ:\r\n\r\n  It is only of late that I have learned to value the significance of\r\n  fancies and unconscious thoughts about life in the womb.

(Translator.)\r\n\r\nFootnote CU:\r\n\r\n  I may here repeat what I have said in another place (\xe2\x80\x9cDie Zuk\xc3\xbcnftigen\r\n  Chancen der psychoanalytischen Therapie,\xe2\x80\x9d _Zentralblatt f\xc3\xbcr\r\n  Psychoanalyse_, I., No. 1 and 2, 1910): \xe2\x80\x9cSome time ago I learned that\r\n  a psychologist who is unfamiliar with our work remarked to one of my\r\n  friends that we are surely over-estimating the secret sexual\r\n  significance of dreams. He stated that his most frequent dream was of\r\n  climbing a stairway, and that there was surely nothing sexual behind\r\n  this. Our attention having been called to this objection, we directed\r\n  our investigations to the occurrence of stairways, stairs, and ladders\r\n  in the dream, and we soon ascertained that stairs (or anything\r\n  analogous to them) represent a definite symbol of coitus. The basis\r\n  for this comparison is not difficult to find; under rhythmic intervals\r\n  and with increasing difficulty in breathing one reaches to a height,\r\n  and may come down again in a few rapid jumps. Thus the rhythm of\r\n  coitus is recognisable in climbing stairs. Let us not forget to\r\n  consider the usage of language. It shows us that the \xe2\x80\x9cclimbing\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cmounting\xe2\x80\x9d is, without further addition, used as a substitutive\r\n  designation of the sexual act.

She\r\n  herself in youth had drawn much information from forbidden books.\r\n\r\nFootnote DM:\r\n\r\n  A further train of thought leads to _Penthesileia_ by the same author:\r\n  cruelty towards her lover.\r\n\r\nFootnote DN:\r\n\r\n  Given by translator as author\xe2\x80\x99s example could not be translated.\r\n\r\nFootnote DO:\r\n\r\n  The same analysis and synthesis of syllables\xe2\x80\x94a veritable chemistry of\r\n  syllables\xe2\x80\x94serves us for many a jest in waking life. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the\r\n  cheapest method of obtaining silver? You go to a field where\r\n  silver-berries are growing and pick them; then the berries are\r\n  eliminated and the silver remains in a free state.\xe2\x80\x9d The first person\r\n  who read and criticised this book made the objection to me\xe2\x80\x94which other\r\n  readers will probably repeat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat the dreamer often appears too\r\n  witty.\xe2\x80\x9d That is true, as long as it applies to the dreamer; it\r\n  involves a condemnation only when its application is extended to the\r\n  interpreter of the dream. In waking reality I can make very little\r\n  claim to the predicate \xe2\x80\x9cwitty\xe2\x80\x9d; if my dreams appear witty, this is not\r\n  the fault of my individuality, but of the peculiar psychological\r\n  conditions under which the dream is fabricated, and is intimately\r\n  connected with the theory of wit and the comical. The dream becomes\r\n  witty because the shortest and most direct way to the expression of\r\n  its thoughts is barred for it: the dream is under constraint. My\r\n  readers may convince themselves that the dreams of my patients give\r\n  the impression of being witty (attempting to be witty), in the same\r\n  degree and in a greater than my own. Nevertheless this reproach\r\n  impelled me to compare the technique of wit with the dream activity,\r\n  which I have done in a book published in 1905, on _Wit and its\r\n  Relation to the Unconscious_. (Author.)\r\n\r\nFootnote DP:\r\n\r\n  Lasker died of progressive paralysis, that is of the consequences of\r\n  an infection caught from a woman (lues); Lasalle, as is well known,\r\n  was killed in a duel on account of a lady.\r\n\r\nFootnote DQ:\r\n\r\n  In the case of a young man who was suffering from obsessions, but\r\n  whose intellectual functions were intact and highly developed, I\r\n  recently found the only exception to this rule. The speeches which\r\n  occurred in his dreams did not originate in speeches which he had\r\n  heard or had made himself, but corresponded to the undisfigured\r\n  wording of his obsessive thoughts, which only came to his\r\n  consciousness in a changed state while he was awake.\r\n\r\nFootnote DR:\r\n\r\n  Psychic intensity, value, and emphasis due to the interest of an idea\r\n  are, of course, to be kept distinct from sensational intensity, and\r\n  from intensity of that which is conceived.\r\n\r\nFootnote DS:\r\n\r\n  Since I consider this reference of dream disfigurement to the censor\r\n  as the essence of my dream theory, I here insert the latter portion of\r\n  a story \xe2\x80\x9cTraumen wie Wachen\xe2\x80\x9d from _Phantasien eines Realisten_, by\r\n  Lynkus, Vienna, (second edition, 1900), in which I find this chief\r\n  feature of my theory reproduced:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cConcerning a man who possesses the remarkable quality of never\r\n  dreaming nonsense....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cYour marvellous characteristic of dreaming as you wake is based upon\r\n  your virtues, upon your goodness, your justice, and your love for\r\n  truth; it is the moral clearness of your nature which makes everything\r\n  about you intelligible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cBut if you think the matter over carefully,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\n  almost believe that all people are created as I am, and that no human\r\n  being ever dreams nonsense! A dream which is so distinctly remembered\r\n  that it can be reproduced, which is therefore no dream of delirium,\r\n  _always_ has a meaning; why, it cannot be otherwise! For that which is\r\n  in contradiction with itself can never be grouped together as a whole.\r\n  The fact that time and space are often thoroughly shaken up detracts\r\n  nothing from the real meaning of the dream, because neither of them\r\n  has had any significance whatever for its essential contents. We often\r\n  do the same thing in waking life; think of the fairy-tale, of many\r\n  daring and profound phantastic creations, about which only an ignorant\r\n  person would say: \xe2\x80\x98That is nonsense! For it is impossible.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cIf it were only always possible to interpret dreams correctly, as you\r\n  have just done with mine!\xe2\x80\x9d said the friend.\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cThat is certainly not an easy task, but the dreamer himself ought\r\n  always to succeed in doing it with a little concentration of\r\n  attention.... You ask why it is generally impossible? Your dreams seem\r\n  to conceal something secret, something unchaste of a peculiar and\r\n  higher nature, a certain mystery in your nature which cannot easily be\r\n  revealed by thought; and it is for that reason that your dreaming\r\n  seems so often to be without meaning, or even to be a contradiction.\r\n  But in the profoundest sense this is by no means the case; indeed it\r\n  cannot be true at all, for it is always the same person, whether he is\r\n  asleep or awake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFootnote DT:\r\n\r\n  I have since given the complete analysis and synthesis of two dreams\r\n  in the _Bruchstueck einer Hysterieanalyse_, 1905.\r\n\r\nFootnote DU:\r\n\r\n  From a work of K. Abel, _Der Gegensinn der Urworte_, 1884 (see my\r\n  review of it in the Bleuler-Freud _Jahrbuch_, II., 1910), I learned\r\n  with surprise a fact which is confirmed by other philologists, that\r\n  the oldest languages behaved in this regard quite like the dream. They\r\n  originally had only one word for both extremes in a series of\r\n  qualities or activities (strong\xe2\x80\x94weak, old\xe2\x80\x94young, far\xe2\x80\x94near, to tie\xe2\x80\x94to\r\n  separate), and formed separate designations for the two extremes only\r\n  secondarily through slight modifications of the common primitive word.\r\n  Abel demonstrated these relationships with rare exceptions in the old\r\n  Egyptian, and he was able to show distinct remnants of the same\r\n  development in the Semitic and Indo-Germanic languages.\r\n\r\nFootnote DV:\r\n\r\n  If I do not know behind which of the persons which occur in the dream\r\n  I am to look for my ego, I observe the following rule: That person in\r\n  the dream who is subject to an emotion which I experience while\r\n  asleep, is the one that conceals my ego.\r\n\r\nFootnote DW:\r\n\r\n  The hysterical attack sometimes uses the same device\xe2\x80\x94the inversion of\r\n  time-relations\xe2\x80\x94for the purpose of concealing its meaning from the\r\n  spectator. The attack of a hysterical girl, for example, consists in\r\n  enacting a little romance, which she has unconsciously fancied in\r\n  connection with an encounter in the street car. A man, attracted by\r\n  the beauty of her foot, addresses her while she is reading, whereupon\r\n  she goes with him and experiences a stormy love scene. Her attack\r\n  begins with the representation of this scene in writhing movements of\r\n  the body (accompanied by motions of the lips to signify kissing,\r\n  entwining of the arms for embraces), whereupon she hurries into\r\n  another room, sits down in a chair, lifts her skirt in order to show\r\n  her foot, acts as though she were about to read a book, and speaks to\r\n  me (answers me).\r\n\r\nFootnote DX:\r\n\r\n  Accompanying hysterical symptoms: Failure to menstruate and profound\r\n  depression, which was the chief ailment of the patient.\r\n\r\nFootnote DY:\r\n\r\n  A reference to a childhood experience is after complete analysis shown\r\n  to exist by the following intermediaries: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Moor has done his duty,\r\n  the Moor _may go_.\xe2\x80\x9d And then follows the waggish question: \xe2\x80\x9cHow old is\r\n  the Moor when he has done his duty? One year. Then he may go.\xe2\x80\x9d (It is\r\n  said that I came into the world with so much black curly hair that my\r\n  young mother declared me to be a Moor.) The circumstance that I do not\r\n  find my hat is an experience of the day which has been turned to\r\n  account with various significations. Our servant, who is a genius at\r\n  stowing away things, had hidden the hat. A suppression of sad thoughts\r\n  about death is also concealed behind the conclusion of the dream: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\n  have not nearly done my duty yet; I may not go yet.\xe2\x80\x9d Birth and death,\r\n  as in the dream that occurred shortly before about Goethe and the\r\n  paralytic (p. 345).\r\n\r\nFootnote DZ:\r\n\r\n  Cf. _Der Witz und seine Beziehung zum Unbewussten_, 2nd edit. 1912,\r\n  and \xe2\x80\x9cword-bridges,\xe2\x80\x9d in the solutions of neurotic symptoms.\r\n\r\nFootnote EA:\r\n\r\n  In general it is doubtful in the interpretation of every element of\r\n  the dream whether it\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n  (_a_) is to be regarded as having a negative or a positive sense\r\n  (relation of opposition);\r\n\r\n  (_b_) is to be interpreted historically (as a reminiscence);\r\n\r\n  (_c_) is symbolic; or whether\r\n\r\n  (_d_) its valuation is to be based upon the sound of its verbal\r\n  expression.\r\n\r\n  In spite of this manifold signification, it may be said that the\r\n  representation of the dream activity does not impose upon the\r\n  translator any greater difficulties than the ancient writers of\r\n  hieroglyphics imposed upon their readers.\r\n\r\nFootnote EB:\r\n\r\n  For the interpretation of this preliminary dream, which is to be\r\n  regarded as \xe2\x80\x9ccasual,\xe2\x80\x9d see p. 292.\r\n\r\nFootnote EC:\r\n\r\n  Her career.\r\n\r\nFootnote ED:\r\n\r\n  High birth, the wish contrast to the preliminary dream.\r\n\r\nFootnote EE:\r\n\r\n  A composite image, which unites two localities, the so-called garret\r\n  (German _Boden_\xe2\x80\x94floor, garret) of her father\xe2\x80\x99s house, in which she\r\n  played with her brother, the object of her later fancies, and the\r\n  garden of a malicious uncle, who used to tease her.\r\n\r\nFootnote EF:\r\n\r\n  Wish contrast to an actual memory of her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s garden, to the effect\r\n  that she used to expose herself while she was asleep.\r\n\r\nFootnote EG:\r\n\r\n  Just as the angel bears a lily stem in the Annunciation.\r\n\r\nFootnote EH:\r\n\r\n  For the explanation of this composite image, see p. 296; innocence,\r\n  menstruation, Camille.\r\n\r\nFootnote EI:\r\n\r\n  Referring to the plurality of the persons who serve the purpose of her\r\n  fancy.\r\n\r\nFootnote EJ:\r\n\r\n  Whether it is permitted to \xe2\x80\x9cpull one off,\xe2\x80\x9d _i.e._ to masturbate.\r\n\r\nFootnote EK:\r\n\r\n  The bough has long since been used to represent the male genital, and\r\n  besides that it contains a very distinct allusion to the family name\r\n  of the dreamer.\r\n\r\nFootnote EL:\r\n\r\n  Refers to matrimonial precautions, as does that which follows.\r\n\r\nFootnote EM:\r\n\r\n  An analogous \xe2\x80\x9cbiographical\xe2\x80\x9d dream was reported on p. 252, as the third\r\n  of the examples of dream symbolism; a second example is the one fully\r\n  reported by Rank[106] under the title \xe2\x80\x9cTraum der sich selbst deutet\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\n  for another one which must be read in the \xe2\x80\x9copposite direction,\xe2\x80\x9d see\r\n  Stekel[114], p. 486.\r\n\r\nFootnote EN:\r\n\r\n  Given by translator as author\xe2\x80\x99s example could not be translated.\r\n\r\nFootnote EO:\r\n\r\n  The neurosis also proceeds in the same manner. I know a patient who\r\n  involuntarily\xe2\x80\x94contrary to her own wishes\xe2\x80\x94hears (hallucinatory) songs\r\n  or fragments of songs without being able to understand their meaning\r\n  to her psychic life. She is surely not a paranoiac. Analysis showed\r\n  that she wrongly utilised the text of these songs by means of a\r\n  certain license. \xe2\x80\x9cOh thou blissful one, Oh thou happy one,\xe2\x80\x9d is the\r\n  beginning of a Christmas song. By not continuing it to the word\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cChristmas time\xe2\x80\x9d she makes a bridal song out of it, &c. The same\r\n  mechanism of disfigurement may take place also without hallucinations\r\n  as a mere mental occurrence.\r\n\r\nFootnote EP:\r\n\r\n  As a contribution to the over-determination: My excuse for coming late\r\n  was that after working late at night I had in the morning to make the\r\n  long journey from Kaiser Josef Street to Waehringer Street.\r\n\r\nFootnote EQ:\r\n\r\n  In addition C\xc3\xa6sar\xe2\x80\x94Kaiser.\r\n\r\nFootnote ER:\r\n\r\n  I have forgotten in what author I found a dream mentioned that was\r\n  overrun with unusually small figures, the source of which turned out\r\n  to be one of the engravings of Jacques Callot, which the dreamer had\r\n  looked at during the day. These engravings contained an enormous\r\n  number of very small figures; a series of them treats of the horrors\r\n  of the Thirty Years\xe2\x80\x99 War.\r\n\r\nFootnote ES:\r\n\r\n  The frequency with which in the dream dead persons appear as living,\r\n  act, and deal with us, has called forth undue astonishment and given\r\n  rise to strange explanations, from which our ignorance of the dream\r\n  becomes strikingly evident. And yet the explanation for these dreams\r\n  lies very close at hand. How often we have occasion to think: \xe2\x80\x9c_If_\r\n  father were still alive, what would he say to it?\xe2\x80\x9d The dream can\r\n  express this _if_ in no other way than by present time in a definite\r\n  situation. Thus, for instance, a young man, whose grandfather has left\r\n  him a great inheritance, dreams that his grandfather is alive and\r\n  demands an accounting of him, upon an occasion when the young man had\r\n  been reproached for making too great an expenditure of money. What we\r\n  consider a resistance to the dream\xe2\x80\x94the objection made by our better\r\n  knowledge, that after all the man is already dead\xe2\x80\x94is in reality a\r\n  consolation, because the dead person did not have this or that\r\n  experience, or satisfaction at the knowledge that he has nothing more\r\n  to say.\r\n\r\n  Another form of absurdity found in dreams of deceased relatives does\r\n  not express folly and absurdity, but serves to represent the most\r\n  extreme rejection; as the representation of a repressed thought which\r\n  one would gladly have appear as something least thought of. Dreams of\r\n  this kind are only solvable if one recalls that the dream makes no\r\n  distinction between things desired and realities. Thus, for example, a\r\n  man who nursed his father during his sickness, and who felt his death\r\n  very keenly, sometime afterward dreamed the following senseless dream:\r\n  _The father was again living, and conversed with him as usual, but_\r\n  (the remarkable thing about it) _he had nevertheless died, though he\r\n  did not know it_. This dream can be understood if after \xe2\x80\x9che had\r\n  nevertheless died,\xe2\x80\x9d one inserts _in consequence of the dreamer\xe2\x80\x99s wish,\r\n  and_ if after \xe2\x80\x9cbut he did not know it\xe2\x80\x9d one adds _that the dreamer has\r\n  entertained this wish_. While nursing his father, the son often wishes\r\n  his father\xe2\x80\x99s death; _i.e._ he entertained the really compassionate\r\n  desire that death finally put an end to his suffering. While mourning\r\n  after his death, this very wish of compassion became an unconscious\r\n  reproach, as if it had really contributed to shorten the life of the\r\n  sick man. Through the awakening of early infantile feelings against\r\n  the father, it became possible to express this reproach as a dream;\r\n  and it was just because of the world-wide contrast between the dream\r\n  inciter and day thought that this dream had to come out so absurdly\r\n  (_cf._ with this, \xe2\x80\x9cFormulierungen \xc3\xbcber die zwei Prinzipien des\r\n  seelischen Geschehens,\xe2\x80\x9d _Jahrbuch_, Bleuler-Freud, III, 1, 1911).\r\n\r\nFootnote ET:\r\n\r\n  Here the dream activity parodies the thought which it designates as\r\n  ridiculous, in that it creates something ridiculous in relation to it.\r\n  Heine does something similar when he tries to mock the bad rhymes of\r\n  the King of Bavaria. He does it in still worse rhymes:\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x9cHerr Ludwig ist ein grosser Poet\r\n                Und singt er, so stuerzt Apollo\r\n                Vor ihm auf die Knie und bittet und fleht,\r\n                \xe2\x80\x98Halt ein, ich werde sonst toll oh!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFootnote EU:\r\n\r\n  Note the resemblance of _Geseres_ and _Ungeseres_ to the German words\r\n  for salted and unsalted\xe2\x80\x94_gesalzen_ and _ungesalzen_; also to the\r\n  German words for soured and unsoured\xe2\x80\x94_gesauert_ and _ungesauert_.\r\n  (Translator.)\r\n\r\nFootnote EV:\r\n\r\n  This dream also furnishes a good example for the general thesis that\r\n  dreams of the same night, even though they be separated in memory,\r\n  spring from the same thought material. The dream situation in which I\r\n  am rescuing my children from the city of Rome, moreover, is disfigured\r\n  by a reference to an episode belonging to my childhood. The meaning is\r\n  that I envy certain relatives who years ago had occasion to transplant\r\n  their children to another soil.\r\n\r\nFootnote EW:\r\n\r\n  This German expression is equivalent to our saying \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not\r\n  responsible for that,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cThat has not been acquired through your own\r\n  efforts.\xe2\x80\x9d (Translator.)\r\n\r\nFootnote EX:\r\n\r\n  The injunction or purpose contained in the dream, \xe2\x80\x9cI must tell that to\r\n  the doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d which occurs in dreams that are dreamed in the course of\r\n  psychoanalytical treatment, regularly corresponds to a great\r\n  resistance to the confession involved in the dream, and is not\r\n  infrequently followed by forgetting of the dream.\r\n\r\nFootnote EY:\r\n\r\n  A subject about which an extensive discussion has taken place in the\r\n  volumes of the _Revue Philosophique_\xe2\x80\x94(Paramnesia in the Dream).\r\n\r\nFootnote EZ:\r\n\r\n  These results correct in several respects my earlier statements\r\n  concerning the representation of logical relations (p. 290). The\r\n  latter described the general conditions of dream activity, but they\r\n  did not take into consideration its finest and most careful\r\n  performances.\r\n\r\nFootnote FA:\r\n\r\n  Stanniol, allusion to _Stannius_, the nervous system of fishes; _cf._\r\n  p. 325.\r\n\r\nFootnote FB:\r\n\r\n  The place in the corridor of my apartment house where the baby\r\n  carriages of the other tenants stand; it is also otherwise several\r\n  times over-determined.\r\n\r\nFootnote FC:\r\n\r\n  This description is not intelligible even to myself, but I follow the\r\n  principle of reproducing the dream in those words which occur to me\r\n  while I am writing it down. The wording itself is a part of the dream\r\n  representation.\r\n\r\nFootnote FD:\r\n\r\n  Schiller was not born in one of the Marburgs, but in Marbach, as every\r\n  graduate of a Gymnasium knows, and as I also knew. This again is one\r\n  of those errors (_cf._ p. 165) which are included as substitutes for\r\n  an intended deception at another place\xe2\x80\x94an explanation of which I have\r\n  attempted in the _Psychopathologie des Alltagslebens_.\r\n\r\nFootnote FE:\r\n\r\n  As analogy to this, I have since explained the extraordinary effect of\r\n  pleasure produced by \xe2\x80\x9ctendency\xe2\x80\x9d wit.\r\n\r\nFootnote FF:\r\n\r\n  It is this fancy from the unconscious dream thoughts which\r\n  peremptorily demands _non vivit_ instead of _non vixit_. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\r\n  come too late, he is no longer alive.\xe2\x80\x9d The fact that the manifest\r\n  situation also tends towards \xe2\x80\x9cnon vivit\xe2\x80\x9d has been mentioned on page\r\n  334.\r\n\r\nFootnote FG:\r\n\r\n  It is striking that the name Joseph plays such a large part in my\r\n  dreams (see the dream about my uncle). I can hide my ego in the dream\r\n  behind persons of this name with particular ease, for Joseph was the\r\n  name of the _dream interpreter_ in the Bible.\r\n\r\nFootnote FH:\r\n\r\n  R\xc3\xaave, petit roman\xe2\x80\x94day-dream, story.\r\n\r\nFootnote FI:\r\n\r\n  I have analysed a good example of a dream of this kind having its\r\n  origin in the stratification of several phantasies, in the _Bruchst\xc3\xbcck\r\n  einer Hysterie Analyse_, 1905. Moreover I undervalued the significance\r\n  of such phantasies for dream formation, as long as I was working\r\n  chiefly with my own dreams, which were based rarely upon day dreams,\r\n  most frequently upon discussions and mental conflicts. With other\r\n  persons it is often much easier to prove the _full analogy between the\r\n  nocturnal dream and the day dream_. It is often possible in an\r\n  hysterical patient to replace an attack by a dream; it is then obvious\r\n  that the phantasy of day dreams is the first step for both psychic\r\n  formations.\r\n\r\nFootnote FJ:\r\n\r\n  See the _Psychopathology of Everyday Life_, 4th ed., 1912.

These paths are constantly open\r\n  and never fall into disuse; they conduct the discharge of the exciting\r\n  process as often as it becomes endowed with unconscious excitement. To\r\n  speak metaphorically they suffer the same form of annihilation as the\r\n  shades of the lower region in the _Odyssey_, who awoke to new life the\r\n  moment they drank blood. The processes depending on the foreconscious\r\n  system are destructible in a different way. The psychotherapy of the\r\n  neuroses is based on this difference.\r\n\r\nFootnote FS:\r\n\r\n  Le Lorrain justly extols the wish-fulfilment of the dream: \xe2\x80\x9cSans\r\n  fatigue s\xc3\xa9rieuse, sans \xc3\xaatre oblig\xc3\xa9 de recourir \xc3\xa0 cette lutte opini\xc3\xa2tre\r\n  et longue qui use et corrode les jouissances poursuivies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFootnote FT:\r\n\r\n  This idea has been borrowed from _The Theory of Sleep_ by Li\xc3\xa9bault,\r\n  who revived hypnotic investigation in our days. (_Du Sommeil\r\n  provoqu\xc3\xa9_, etc.; Paris, 1889.)\r\n\r\nFootnote FU:\r\n\r\n  The German of the word _bird_ is \xe2\x80\x9cVogel,\xe2\x80\x9d which gives origin to the\r\n  vulgar expression \xe2\x80\x9cv\xc3\xb6glen,\xe2\x80\x9d denoting sexual intercourse. (Trans.\r\n  note.)\r\n\r\nFootnote FV:\r\n\r\n  The italics are my own, though the meaning is plain enough without\r\n  them.\r\n\r\nFootnote FW:\r\n\r\n  The italics are mine.\r\n\r\nFootnote FX:\r\n\r\n  _Cf._ the significant observations by J. Breuer in our _Studies on\r\n  Hysteria_, 1895, and 2nd ed. 1909.\r\n\r\nFootnote FY:\r\n\r\n  Here, as in other places, there are gaps in the treatment of the\r\n  subject, which I have left intentionally, because to fill them up\r\n  would require on the one hand too great effort, and on the other hand\r\n  an extensive reference to material that is foreign to the dream. Thus\r\n  I have avoided stating whether I connect with the word \xe2\x80\x9csuppressed\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n  another sense than with the word \xe2\x80\x9crepressed.\xe2\x80\x9d It has been made clear\r\n  only that the latter emphasizes more than the former the relation to\r\n  the unconscious. I have not entered into the cognate problem why the\r\n  dream thoughts also experience distortion by the censor when they\r\n  abandon the progressive continuation to consciousness and choose the\r\n  path of regression. I have been above all anxious to awaken an\r\n  interest in the problems to which the further analysis of the\r\n  dream-work leads and to indicate the other themes which meet these on\r\n  the way. It was not always easy to decide just where the pursuit\r\n  should be discontinued. That I have not treated exhaustively the part\r\n  played in the dream by the psychosexual life and have avoided the\r\n  interpretation of dreams of an obvious sexual content is due to a\r\n  special reason which may not come up to the reader\xe2\x80\x99s expectation. To\r\n  be sure, it is very far from my ideas and the principles expressed by\r\n  me in neuropathology to regard the sexual life as a \xe2\x80\x9cpudendum\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\n  should be left unconsidered by the physician and the scientific\r\n  investigator. I also consider ludicrous the moral indignation which\r\n  prompted the translator of Artemidoros of Daldis to keep from the\r\n  reader\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge the chapter on sexual dreams contained in the\r\n  _Symbolism of the Dreams_. As for myself, I have been actuated solely\r\n  by the conviction that in the explanation of sexual dreams I should be\r\n  bound to entangle myself deeply in the still unexplained problems of\r\n  perversion and bisexuality; and for that reason I have reserved this\r\n  material for another connection.\r\n\r\nFootnote FZ:\r\n\r\n  The dream is not the only phenomenon tending to base psychopathology\r\n  on psychology. In a short series of unfinished articles\r\n  (\xe2\x80\x9cMonatsschrift f\xc3\xbcr Psychiatrie und Neurologie\xe2\x80\x9d entitled _\xc3\x9cber den\r\n  psychischen Mechanismus der Vergesslichkeit_, 1898, and _\xc3\x9cber\r\n  Deckerinnerungen_, 1899) I attempt to interpret a number of psychic\r\n  manifestations from everyday life in support of the same conception.\r\n  These and other articles on \xe2\x80\x9cForgetting,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLapse of Speech,\xe2\x80\x9d &c., have\r\n  since been published collectively under the title of _Psychopathology\r\n  of Everyday Life_, 1904 and 1907, of which an English translation will\r\n  shortly appear.\r\n\r\nFootnote GA:\r\n\r\n  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Conception of the Unconscious in Psychology\xe2\x80\x9d: Lecture delivered\r\n  at the Third International Congress of Psychology at Munich, 1897.\r\n\r\nFootnote GB:\r\n\r\n  _Cf._ here (p. 82) the dream (\xce\xa3\xce\xb1-\xcf\x84\xcf\x85\xcf\x81\xce\xbf\xcf\x82) of Alexander the Great at the\r\n  siege of Tyrus.\r\n\r\nFootnote GC:\r\n\r\n  Professor Ernst Oppenheim (Vienna) has shown me from folk-lore\r\n  material that there is a class of dreams for which even the people\r\n  drop the expectation of future interpretation, and which they trace in\r\n  a perfectly correct manner to wish feelings and wants arising during\r\n  sleep. He will in the near future fully report upon these dreams,\r\n  which for the most part are in the form of \xe2\x80\x9cfunny stories.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Printed by BALLANTYNE, HANSON & CO.\r\n                          Edinburgh & London.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER\xe2\x80\x99S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\'s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
