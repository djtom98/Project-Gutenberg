Farewell to Nemi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface\r\n\r\nTHE PRIMARY aim of this book is to explain the remarkable rule which\r\nregulated the succession to the priesthood of Diana at Aricia. When\r\nI first set myself to solve the problem more than thirty years ago,\r\nI thought that the solution could be propounded very briefly, but I\r\nsoon found that to render it probable or even intelligible it was\r\nnecessary to discuss certain more general questions, some of which\r\nhad hardly been broached before. In successive editions the\r\ndiscussion of these and kindred topics has occupied more and more\r\nspace, the enquiry has branched out in more and more directions,\r\nuntil the two volumes of the original work have expanded into\r\ntwelve. Meantime a wish has often been expressed that the book\r\nshould be issued in a more compendious form. This abridgment is an\r\nattempt to meet the wish and thereby to bring the work within the\r\nrange of a wider circle of readers. While the bulk of the book has\r\nbeen greatly reduced, I have endeavoured to retain its leading\r\nprinciples, together with an amount of evidence sufficient to\r\nillustrate them clearly. The language of the original has also for\r\nthe most part been preserved, though here and there the exposition\r\nhas been somewhat condensed. In order to keep as much of the text as\r\npossible I have sacrificed all the notes, and with them all exact\r\nreferences to my authorities. Readers who desire to ascertain the\r\nsource of any particular statement must therefore consult the larger\r\nwork, which is fully documented and provided with a complete\r\nbibliography.\r\n\r\nIn the abridgment I have neither added new matter nor altered the\r\nviews expressed in the last edition; for the evidence which has come\r\nto my knowledge in the meantime has on the whole served either to\r\nconfirm my former conclusions or to furnish fresh illustrations of\r\nold principles. Thus, for example, on the crucial question of the\r\npractice of putting kings to death either at the end of a fixed\r\nperiod or whenever their health and strength began to fail, the body\r\nof evidence which points to the wide prevalence of such a custom has\r\nbeen considerably augmented in the interval. A striking instance of\r\na limited monarchy of this sort is furnished by the powerful\r\nmediaeval kingdom of the Khazars in Southern Russia, where the kings\r\nwere liable to be put to death either on the expiry of a set term or\r\nwhenever some public calamity, such as drought, dearth, or defeat in\r\nwar, seemed to indicate a failure of their natural powers. The\r\nevidence for the systematic killing of the Khazar kings, drawn from\r\nthe accounts of old Arab travellers, has been collected by me\r\nelsewhere.[1] Africa, again, has supplied several fresh examples of\r\na similar practice of regicide. Among them the most notable perhaps\r\nis the custom formerly observed in Bunyoro of choosing every year\r\nfrom a particular clan a mock king, who was supposed to incarnate\r\nthe late king, cohabited with his widows at his temple-tomb, and\r\nafter reigning for a week was strangled.[2] The custom presents a\r\nclose parallel to the ancient Babylonian festival of the Sacaea, at\r\nwhich a mock king was dressed in the royal robes, allowed to enjoy\r\nthe real king\'s concubines, and after reigning for five days was\r\nstripped, scourged, and put to death. That festival in its turn has\r\nlately received fresh light from certain Assyrian inscriptions,[3]\r\nwhich seem to confirm the interpretation which I formerly gave of\r\nthe festival as a New Year celebration and the parent of the Jewish\r\nfestival of Purim.[4] Other recently discovered parallels to the\r\npriestly kings of Aricia are African priests and kings who used to\r\nbe put to death at the end of seven or of two years, after being\r\nliable in the interval to be attacked and killed by a strong man,\r\nwho thereupon succeeded to the priesthood or the kingdom.[5]\r\n\r\n[1] J.

Palmer, in _Journal of the African Society,_ July 1912, pp. 403,\r\n407 _sq._\r\n\r\nWith these and other instances of like customs before us it is no\r\nlonger possible to regard the rule of succession to the priesthood\r\nof Diana at Aricia as exceptional; it clearly exemplifies a\r\nwidespread institution, of which the most numerous and the most\r\nsimilar cases have thus far been found in Africa. How far the facts\r\npoint to an early influence of Africa on Italy, or even to the\r\nexistence of an African population in Southern Europe, I do not\r\npresume to say. The pre-historic historic relations between the two\r\ncontinents are still obscure and still under investigation.\r\n\r\nWhether the explanation which I have offered of the institution is\r\ncorrect or not must be left to the future to determine. I shall\r\nalways be ready to abandon it if a better can be suggested. Meantime\r\nin committing the book in its new form to the judgment of the public\r\nI desire to guard against a misapprehension of its scope which\r\nappears to be still rife, though I have sought to correct it before\r\nnow. If in the present work I have dwelt at some length on the\r\nworship of trees, it is not, I trust, because I exaggerate its\r\nimportance in the history of religion, still less because I would\r\ndeduce from it a whole system of mythology; it is simply because I\r\ncould not ignore the subject in attempting to explain the\r\nsignificance of a priest who bore the title of King of the Wood, and\r\none of whose titles to office was the plucking of a bough--the\r\nGolden Bough--from a tree in the sacred grove. But I am so far from\r\nregarding the reverence for trees as of supreme importance for the\r\nevolution of religion that I consider it to have been altogether\r\nsubordinate to other factors, and in particular to the fear of the\r\nhuman dead, which, on the whole, I believe to have been probably the\r\nmost powerful force in the making of primitive religion. I hope that\r\nafter this explicit disclaimer I shall no longer be taxed with\r\nembracing a system of mythology which I look upon not merely as\r\nfalse but as preposterous and absurd. But I am too familiar with the\r\nhydra of error to expect that by lopping off one of the monster\'s\r\nheads I can prevent another, or even the same, from sprouting again.\r\nI can only trust to the candour and intelligence of my readers to\r\nrectify this serious misconception of my views by a comparison with\r\nmy own express declaration.\r\n\r\nJ. G. FRAZER.\r\n\r\n1 BRICK COURT, TEMPLE, LONDON,\r\nJune 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The King of the Wood\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Diana and Virbius\r\n\r\nWHO does not know Turner\'s picture of the Golden Bough? The scene,\r\nsuffused with the golden glow of imagination in which the divine\r\nmind of Turner steeped and transfigured even the fairest natural\r\nlandscape, is a dream-like vision of the little woodland lake of\r\nNemi-- "Diana\'s Mirror," as it was called by the ancients. No one\r\nwho has seen that calm water, lapped in a green hollow of the Alban\r\nhills, can ever forget it. The two characteristic Italian villages\r\nwhich slumber on its banks, and the equally Italian palace whose\r\nterraced gardens descend steeply to the lake, hardly break the\r\nstillness and even the solitariness of the scene. Diana herself\r\nmight still linger by this lonely shore, still haunt these woodlands\r\nwild.\r\n\r\nIn antiquity this sylvan landscape was the scene of a strange and\r\nrecurring tragedy. On the northern shore of the lake, right under\r\nthe precipitous cliffs on which the modern village of Nemi is\r\nperched, stood the sacred grove and sanctuary of Diana Nemorensis,\r\nor Diana of the Wood. The lake and the grove were sometimes known as\r\nthe lake and grove of Aricia. But the town of Aricia (the modern La\r\nRiccia) was situated about three miles off, at the foot of the Alban\r\nMount, and separated by a steep descent from the lake, which lies in\r\na small crater-like hollow on the mountain side. In this sacred\r\ngrove there grew a certain tree round which at any time of the day,\r\nand probably far into the night, a grim figure might be seen to\r\nprowl. In his hand he carried a drawn sword, and he kept peering\r\nwarily about him as if at every instant he expected to be set upon\r\nby an enemy. He was a priest and a murderer; and the man for whom he\r\nlooked was sooner or later to murder him and hold the priesthood in\r\nhis stead. Such was the rule of the sanctuary. A candidate for the\r\npriesthood could only succeed to office by slaying the priest, and\r\nhaving slain him, he retained office till he was himself slain by a\r\nstronger or a craftier.\r\n\r\nThe post which he held by this precarious tenure carried with it the\r\ntitle of king; but surely no crowned head ever lay uneasier, or was\r\nvisited by more evil dreams, than his. For year in, year out, in\r\nsummer and winter, in fair weather and in foul, he had to keep his\r\nlonely watch, and whenever he snatched a troubled slumber it was at\r\nthe peril of his life. The least relaxation of his vigilance, the\r\nsmallest abatement of his strength of limb or skill of fence, put\r\nhim in jeopardy; grey hairs might seal his death-warrant. To gentle\r\nand pious pilgrims at the shrine the sight of him might well seem to\r\ndarken the fair landscape, as when a cloud suddenly blots the sun on\r\na bright day. The dreamy blue of Italian skies, the dappled shade of\r\nsummer woods, and the sparkle of waves in the sun, can have accorded\r\nbut ill with that stern and sinister figure. Rather we picture to\r\nourselves the scene as it may have been witnessed by a belated\r\nwayfarer on one of those wild autumn nights when the dead leaves are\r\nfalling thick, and the winds seem to sing the dirge of the dying\r\nyear. It is a sombre picture, set to melancholy music--the\r\nbackground of forest showing black and jagged against a lowering and\r\nstormy sky, the sighing of the wind in the branches, the rustle of\r\nthe withered leaves under foot, the lapping of the cold water on the\r\nshore, and in the foreground, pacing to and fro, now in twilight and\r\nnow in gloom, a dark figure with a glitter of steel at the shoulder\r\nwhenever the pale moon, riding clear of the cloud-rack, peers down\r\nat him through the matted boughs.\r\n\r\nThe strange rule of this priesthood has no parallel in classical\r\nantiquity, and cannot be explained from it. To find an explanation\r\nwe must go farther afield. No one will probably deny that such a\r\ncustom savours of a barbarous age, and, surviving into imperial\r\ntimes, stands out in striking isolation from the polished Italian\r\nsociety of the day, like a primaeval rock rising from a\r\nsmooth-shaven lawn. It is the very rudeness and barbarity of the\r\ncustom which allow us a hope of explaining it. For recent researches\r\ninto the early history of man have revealed the essential similarity\r\nwith which, under many superficial differences, the human mind has\r\nelaborated its first crude philosophy of life. Accordingly, if we\r\ncan show that a barbarous custom, like that of the priesthood of\r\nNemi, has existed elsewhere; if we can detect the motives which led\r\nto its institution; if we can prove that these motives have operated\r\nwidely, perhaps universally, in human society, producing in varied\r\ncircumstances a variety of institutions specifically different but\r\ngenerically alike; if we can show, lastly, that these very motives,\r\nwith some of their derivative institutions, were actually at work in\r\nclassical antiquity; then we may fairly infer that at a remoter age\r\nthe same motives gave birth to the priesthood of Nemi. Such an\r\ninference, in default of direct evidence as to how the priesthood\r\ndid actually arise, can never amount to demonstration. But it will\r\nbe more or less probable according to the degree of completeness\r\nwith which it fulfils the conditions I have indicated. The object of\r\nthis book is, by meeting these conditions, to offer a fairly\r\nprobable explanation of the priesthood of Nemi.\r\n\r\nI begin by setting forth the few facts and legends which have come\r\ndown to us on the subject. According to one story the worship of\r\nDiana at Nemi was instituted by Orestes, who, after killing Thoas,\r\nKing of the Tauric Chersonese (the Crimea), fled with his sister to\r\nItaly, bringing with him the image of the Tauric Diana hidden in a\r\nfaggot of sticks. After his death his bones were transported from\r\nAricia to Rome and buried in front of the temple of Saturn, on the\r\nCapitoline slope, beside the temple of Concord. The bloody ritual\r\nwhich legend ascribed to the Tauric Diana is familiar to classical\r\nreaders; it is said that every stranger who landed on the shore was\r\nsacrificed on her altar. But transported to Italy, the rite assumed\r\na milder form. Within the sanctuary at Nemi grew a certain tree of\r\nwhich no branch might be broken. Only a runaway slave was allowed to\r\nbreak off, if he could, one of its boughs. Success in the attempt\r\nentitled him to fight the priest in single combat, and if he slew\r\nhim he reigned in his stead with the title of King of the Wood (_Rex\r\nNemorensis_). According to the public opinion of the ancients the\r\nfateful branch was that Golden Bough which, at the Sibyl\'s bidding,\r\nAeneas plucked before he essayed the perilous journey to the world\r\nof the dead. The flight of the slave represented, it was said, the\r\nflight of Orestes; his combat with the priest was a reminiscence of\r\nthe human sacrifices once offered to the Tauric Diana. This rule of\r\nsuccession by the sword was observed down to imperial times; for\r\namongst his other freaks Caligula, thinking that the priest of Nemi\r\nhad held office too long, hired a more stalwart ruffian to slay him;\r\nand a Greek traveller, who visited Italy in the age of the\r\nAntonines, remarks that down to his time the priesthood was still\r\nthe prize of victory in a single combat.\r\n\r\nOf the worship of Diana at Nemi some leading features can still be\r\nmade out. From the votive offerings which have been found on the\r\nsite, it appears that she was conceived of especially as a huntress,\r\nand further as blessing men and women with offspring, and granting\r\nexpectant mothers an easy delivery. Again, fire seems to have played\r\na foremost part in her ritual. For during her annual festival, held\r\non the thirteenth of August, at the hottest time of the year, her\r\ngrove shone with a multitude of torches, whose ruddy glare was\r\nreflected by the lake; and throughout the length and breadth of\r\nItaly the day was kept with holy rites at every domestic hearth.\r\nBronze statuettes found in her precinct represent the goddess\r\nherself holding a torch in her raised right hand; and women whose\r\nprayers had been heard by her came crowned with wreaths and bearing\r\nlighted torches to the sanctuary in fulfilment of their vows. Some\r\none unknown dedicated a perpetually burning lamp in a little shrine\r\nat Nemi for the safety of the Emperor Claudius and his family. The\r\nterra-cotta lamps which have been discovered in the grove may\r\nperhaps have served a like purpose for humbler persons. If so, the\r\nanalogy of the custom to the Catholic practice of dedicating holy\r\ncandles in churches would be obvious. Further, the title of Vesta\r\nborne by Diana at Nemi points clearly to the maintenance of a\r\nperpetual holy fire in her sanctuary. A large circular basement at\r\nthe north-east corner of the temple, raised on three steps and\r\nbearing traces of a mosaic pavement, probably supported a round\r\ntemple of Diana in her character of Vesta, like the round temple of\r\nVesta in the Roman Forum. Here the sacred fire would seem to have\r\nbeen tended by Vestal Virgins, for the head of a Vestal in\r\nterra-cotta was found on the spot, and the worship of a perpetual\r\nfire, cared for by holy maidens, appears to have been common in\r\nLatium from the earliest to the latest times. Further, at the annual\r\nfestival of the goddess, hunting dogs were crowned and wild beasts\r\nwere not molested; young people went through a purificatory ceremony\r\nin her honour; wine was brought forth, and the feast consisted of a\r\nkid cakes served piping hot on plates of leaves, and apples still\r\nhanging in clusters on the boughs.\r\n\r\nBut Diana did not reign alone in her grove at Nemi. Two lesser\r\ndivinities shared her forest sanctuary. One was Egeria, the nymph of\r\nthe clear water which, bubbling from the basaltic rocks, used to\r\nfall in graceful cascades into the lake at the place called Le Mole,\r\nbecause here were established the mills of the modern village of\r\nNemi. The purling of the stream as it ran over the pebbles is\r\nmentioned by Ovid, who tells us that he had often drunk of its\r\nwater. Women with child used to sacrifice to Egeria, because she was\r\nbelieved, like Diana, to be able to grant them an easy delivery.\r\nTradition ran that the nymph had been the wife or mistress of the\r\nwise king Numa, that he had consorted with her in the secrecy of the\r\nsacred grove, and that the laws which he gave the Romans had been\r\ninspired by communion with her divinity. Plutarch compares the\r\nlegend with other tales of the loves of goddesses for mortal men,\r\nsuch as the love of Cybele and the Moon for the fair youths Attis\r\nand Endymion. According to some, the trysting-place of the lovers\r\nwas not in the woods of Nemi but in a grove outside the dripping\r\nPorta Capena at Rome, where another sacred spring of Egeria gushed\r\nfrom a dark cavern. Every day the Roman Vestals fetched water from\r\nthis spring to wash the temple of Vesta, carrying it in earthenware\r\npitchers on their heads. In Juvenal\'s time the natural rock had been\r\nencased in marble, and the hallowed spot was profaned by gangs of\r\npoor Jews, who were suffered to squat, like gypsies, in the grove.\r\nWe may suppose that the spring which fell into the lake of Nemi was\r\nthe true original Egeria, and that when the first settlers moved\r\ndown from the Alban hills to the banks of the Tiber they brought the\r\nnymph with them and found a new home for her in a grove outside the\r\ngates. The remains of baths which have been discovered within the\r\nsacred precinct, together with many terra-cotta models of various\r\nparts of the human body, suggest that the waters of Egeria were used\r\nto heal the sick, who may have signified their hopes or testified\r\ntheir gratitude by dedicating likenesses of the diseased members to\r\nthe goddess, in accordance with a custom which is still observed in\r\nmany parts of Europe. To this day it would seem that the spring\r\nretains medicinal virtues.\r\n\r\nThe other of the minor deities at Nemi was Virbius. Legend had it\r\nthat Virbius was the young Greek hero Hippolytus, chaste and fair,\r\nwho learned the art of venery from the centaur Chiron, and spent all\r\nhis days in the greenwood chasing wild beasts with the virgin\r\nhuntress Artemis (the Greek counterpart of Diana) for his only\r\ncomrade. Proud of her divine society, he spurned the love of women,\r\nand this proved his bane. For Aphrodite, stung by his scorn,\r\ninspired his stepmother Phaedra with love of him; and when he\r\ndisdained her wicked advances she falsely accused him to his father\r\nTheseus. The slander was believed, and Theseus prayed to his sire\r\nPoseidon to avenge the imagined wrong. So while Hippolytus drove in\r\na chariot by the shore of the Saronic Gulf, the sea-god sent a\r\nfierce bull forth from the waves. The terrified horses bolted, threw\r\nHippolytus from the chariot, and dragged him at their hoofs to\r\ndeath. But Diana, for the love she bore Hippolytus, persuaded the\r\nleech Aesculapius to bring her fair young hunter back to life by his\r\nsimples. Jupiter, indignant that a mortal man should return from the\r\ngates of death, thrust down the meddling leech himself to Hades. But\r\nDiana hid her favourite from the angry god in a thick cloud,\r\ndisguised his features by adding years to his life, and then bore\r\nhim far away to the dells of Nemi, where she entrusted him to the\r\nnymph Egeria, to live there, unknown and solitary, under the name of\r\nVirbius, in the depth of the Italian forest. There he reigned a\r\nking, and there he dedicated a precinct to Diana. He had a comely\r\nson, Virbius, who, undaunted by his father\'s fate, drove a team of\r\nfiery steeds to join the Latins in the war against Aeneas and the\r\nTrojans. Virbius was worshipped as a god not only at Nemi but\r\nelsewhere; for in Campania we hear of a special priest devoted to\r\nhis service. Horses were excluded from the Arician grove and\r\nsanctuary because horses had killed Hippolytus. It was unlawful to\r\ntouch his image. Some thought that he was the sun. "But the truth\r\nis," says Servius, "that he is a deity associated with Diana, as\r\nAttis is associated with the Mother of the Gods, and Erichthonius\r\nwith Minerva, and Adonis with Venus." What the nature of that\r\nassociation was we shall enquire presently. Here it is worth\r\nobserving that in his long and chequered career this mythical\r\npersonage has displayed a remarkable tenacity of life. For we can\r\nhardly doubt that the Saint Hippolytus of the Roman calendar, who\r\nwas dragged by horses to death on the thirteenth of August, Diana\'s\r\nown day, is no other than the Greek hero of the same name, who,\r\nafter dying twice over as a heathen sinner, has been happily\r\nresuscitated as a Christian saint.\r\n\r\nIt needs no elaborate demonstration to convince us that the stories\r\ntold to account for Diana\'s worship at Nemi are unhistorical.\r\nClearly they belong to that large class of myths which are made up\r\nto explain the origin of a religious ritual and have no other\r\nfoundation than the resemblance, real or imaginary, which may be\r\ntraced between it and some foreign ritual. The incongruity of these\r\nNemi myths is indeed transparent, since the foundation of the\r\nworship is traced now to Orestes and now to Hippolytus, according as\r\nthis or that feature of the ritual has to be accounted for. The real\r\nvalue of such tales is that they serve to illustrate the nature of\r\nthe worship by providing a standard with which to compare it; and\r\nfurther, that they bear witness indirectly to its venerable age by\r\nshowing that the true origin was lost in the mists of a fabulous\r\nantiquity. In the latter respect these Nemi legends are probably\r\nmore to be trusted than the apparently historical tradition, vouched\r\nfor by Cato the Elder, that the sacred grove was dedicated to Diana\r\nby a certain Egerius Baebius or Laevius of Tusculum, a Latin\r\ndictator, on behalf of the peoples of Tusculum, Aricia, Lanuvium,\r\nLaurentum, Cora, Tibur, Pometia, and Ardea. This tradition indeed\r\nspeaks for the great age of the sanctuary, since it seems to date\r\nits foundation sometime before 495 B.C., the year in which Pometia\r\nwas sacked by the Romans and disappears from history. But we cannot\r\nsuppose that so barbarous a rule as that of the Arician priesthood\r\nwas deliberately instituted by a league of civilised communities,\r\nsuch as the Latin cities undoubtedly were. It must have been handed\r\ndown from a time beyond the memory of man, when Italy was still in a\r\nfar ruder state than any known to us in the historical period. The\r\ncredit of the tradition is rather shaken than confirmed by another\r\nstory which ascribes the foundation of the sanctuary to a certain\r\nManius Egerius, who gave rise to the saying, "There are many Manii\r\nat Aricia." This proverb some explained by alleging that Manius\r\nEgerius was the ancestor of a long and distinguished line, whereas\r\nothers thought it meant that there were many ugly and deformed\r\npeople at Aricia, and they derived the name Manius from _Mania,_ a\r\nbogey or bugbear to frighten children. A Roman satirist uses the\r\nname Manius as typical of the beggars who lay in wait for pilgrims\r\non the Arician slopes. These differences of opinion, together with\r\nthe discrepancy between Manius Egerius of Aricia and Egerius Laevius\r\nof Tusculum, as well as the resemblance of both names to the\r\nmythical Egeria, excite our suspicion. Yet the tradition recorded by\r\nCato seems too circumstantial, and its sponsor too respectable, to\r\nallow us to dismiss it as an idle fiction. Rather we may suppose\r\nthat it refers to some ancient restoration or reconstruction of the\r\nsanctuary, which was actually carried out by the confederate states.\r\nAt any rate it testifies to a belief that the grove had been from\r\nearly times a common place of worship for many of the oldest cities\r\nof the country, if not for the whole Latin confederacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Artemis and Hippolytus\r\n\r\nI HAVE said that the Arician legends of Orestes and Hippolytus,\r\nthough worthless as history, have a certain value in so far as they\r\nmay help us to understand the worship at Nemi better by comparing it\r\nwith the ritual and myths of other sanctuaries. We must ask\r\nourselves, Why did the author of these legends pitch upon Orestes\r\nand Hippolytus in order to explain Virbius and the King of the Wood?\r\nIn regard to Orestes, the answer is obvious. He and the image of the\r\nTauric Diana, which could only be appeased with human blood, were\r\ndragged in to render intelligible the murderous rule of succession\r\nto the Arician priesthood. In regard to Hippolytus the case is not\r\nso plain. The manner of his death suggests readily enough a reason\r\nfor the exclusion of horses from the grove; but this by itself seems\r\nhardly enough to account for the identification. We must try to\r\nprobe deeper by examining the worship as well as the legend or myth\r\nof Hippolytus.\r\n\r\nHe had a famous sanctuary at his ancestral home of Troezen, situated\r\non that beautiful, almost landlocked bay, where groves of oranges\r\nand lemons, with tall cypresses soaring like dark spires above the\r\ngarden of Hesperides, now clothe the strip of fertile shore at the\r\nfoot of the rugged mountains. Across the blue water of the tranquil\r\nbay, which it shelters from the open sea, rises Poseidon\'s sacred\r\nisland, its peaks veiled in the sombre green of the pines. On this\r\nfair coast Hippolytus was worshipped. Within his sanctuary stood a\r\ntemple with an ancient image. His service was performed by a priest\r\nwho held office for life; every year a sacrificial festival was held\r\nin his honour; and his untimely fate was yearly mourned, with\r\nweeping and doleful chants, by unwedded maids. Youths and maidens\r\ndedicated locks of their hair in his temple before marriage. His\r\ngrave existed at Troezen, though the people would not show it. It\r\nhas been suggested, with great plausibility, that in the handsome\r\nHippolytus, beloved of Artemis, cut off in his youthful prime, and\r\nyearly mourned by damsels, we have one of those mortal lovers of a\r\ngoddess who appear so often in ancient religion, and of whom Adonis\r\nis the most familiar type. The rivalry of Artemis and Phaedra for\r\nthe affection of Hippolytus reproduces, it is said, under different\r\nnames, the rivalry of Aphrodite and Proserpine for the love of\r\nAdonis, for Phaedra is merely a double of Aphrodite. The theory\r\nprobably does no injustice either to Hippolytus or to Artemis. For\r\nArtemis was originally a great goddess of fertility, and, on the\r\nprinciples of early religion, she who fertilises nature must herself\r\nbe fertile, and to be that she must necessarily have a male consort.\r\nOn this view, Hippolytus was the consort of Artemis at Troezen, and\r\nthe shorn tresses offered to him by the Troezenian youths and\r\nmaidens before marriage were designed to strengthen his union with\r\nthe goddess, and so to promote the fruitfulness of the earth, of\r\ncattle, and of mankind. It is some confirmation of this view that\r\nwithin the precinct of Hippolytus at Troezen there were worshipped\r\ntwo female powers named Damia and Auxesia, whose connexion with the\r\nfertility of the ground is unquestionable. When Epidaurus suffered\r\nfrom a dearth, the people, in obedience to an oracle, carved images\r\nof Damia and Auxesia out of sacred olive wood, and no sooner had\r\nthey done so and set them up than the earth bore fruit again.\r\nMoreover, at Troezen itself, and apparently within the precinct of\r\nHippolytus, a curious festival of stone-throwing was held in honour\r\nof these maidens, as the Troezenians called them; and it is easy to\r\nshow that similar customs have been practised in many lands for the\r\nexpress purpose of ensuring good crops. In the story of the tragic\r\ndeath of the youthful Hippolytus we may discern an analogy with\r\nsimilar tales of other fair but mortal youths who paid with their\r\nlives for the brief rapture of the love of an immortal goddess.\r\nThese hapless lovers were probably not always mere myths, and the\r\nlegends which traced their spilt blood in the purple bloom of the\r\nviolet, the scarlet stain of the anemone, or the crimson flush of\r\nthe rose were no idle poetic emblems of youth and beauty fleeting as\r\nthe summer flowers. Such fables contain a deeper philosophy of the\r\nrelation of the life of man to the life of nature--a sad philosophy\r\nwhich gave birth to a tragic practice. What that philosophy and that\r\npractice were, we shall learn later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Recapitulation\r\n\r\nWE can now perhaps understand why the ancients identified\r\nHippolytus, the consort of Artemis, with Virbius, who, according to\r\nServius, stood to Diana as Adonis to Venus, or Attis to the Mother\r\nof the Gods. For Diana, like Artemis, was a goddess of fertility in\r\ngeneral, and of childbirth in particular. As such she, like her\r\nGreek counterpart, needed a male partner. That partner, if Servius\r\nis right, was Virbius. In his character of the founder of the sacred\r\ngrove and first king of Nemi, Virbius is clearly the mythical\r\npredecessor or archetype of the line of priests who served Diana\r\nunder the title of Kings of the Wood, and who came, like him, one\r\nafter the other, to a violent end. It is natural, therefore, to\r\nconjecture that they stood to the goddess of the grove in the same\r\nrelation in which Virbius stood to her; in short, that the mortal\r\nKing of the Wood had for his queen the woodland Diana herself. If\r\nthe sacred tree which he guarded with his life was supposed, as\r\nseems probable, to be her special embodiment, her priest may not\r\nonly have worshipped it as his goddess but embraced it as his wife.\r\nThere is at least nothing absurd in the supposition, since even in\r\nthe time of Pliny a noble Roman used thus to treat a beautiful\r\nbeech-tree in another sacred grove of Diana on the Alban hills. He\r\nembraced it, he kissed it, he lay under its shadow, he poured wine\r\non its trunk. Apparently he took the tree for the goddess. The\r\ncustom of physically marrying men and women to trees is still\r\npractised in India and other parts of the East. Why should it not\r\nhave obtained in ancient Latium?\r\n\r\nReviewing the evidence as a whole, we may conclude that the worship\r\nof Diana in her sacred grove at Nemi was of great importance and\r\nimmemorial antiquity; that she was revered as the goddess of\r\nwoodlands and of wild creatures, probably also of domestic cattle\r\nand of the fruits of the earth; that she was believed to bless men\r\nand women with offspring and to aid mothers in childbed; that her\r\nholy fire, tended by chaste virgins, burned perpetually in a round\r\ntemple within the precinct; that associated with her was a\r\nwater-nymph Egeria who discharged one of Diana\'s own functions by\r\nsuccouring women in travail, and who was popularly supposed to have\r\nmated with an old Roman king in the sacred grove; further, that\r\nDiana of the Wood herself had a male companion Virbius by name, who\r\nwas to her what Adonis was to Venus, or Attis to Cybele; and,\r\nlastly, that this mythical Virbius was represented in historical\r\ntimes by a line of priests known as Kings of the Wood, who regularly\r\nperished by the swords of their successors, and whose lives were in\r\na manner bound up with a certain tree in the grove, because so long\r\nas that tree was uninjured they were safe from attack.\r\n\r\nClearly these conclusions do not of themselves suffice to explain\r\nthe peculiar rule of succession to the priesthood. But perhaps the\r\nsurvey of a wider field may lead us to think that they contain in\r\ngerm the solution of the problem. To that wider survey we must now\r\naddress ourselves. It will be long and laborious, but may possess\r\nsomething of the interest and charm of a voyage of discovery, in\r\nwhich we shall visit many strange foreign lands, with strange\r\nforeign peoples, and still stranger customs. The wind is in the\r\nshrouds: we shake out our sails to it, and leave the coast of Italy\r\nbehind us for a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Priestly Kings\r\n\r\nTHE questions which we have set ourselves to answer are mainly two:\r\nfirst, why had Diana\'s priest at Nemi, the King of the Wood, to slay\r\nhis predecessor? second, why before doing so had he to pluck the\r\nbranch of a certain tree which the public opinion of the ancients\r\nidentified with Virgil\'s Golden Bough?\r\n\r\nThe first point on which we fasten is the priest\'s title. Why was he\r\ncalled the King of the Wood? Why was his office spoken of as a\r\nkingdom?\r\n\r\nThe union of a royal title with priestly duties was common in\r\nancient Italy and Greece. At Rome and in other cities of Latium\r\nthere was a priest called the Sacrificial King or King of the Sacred\r\nRites, and his wife bore the title of Queen of the Sacred Rites. In\r\nrepublican Athens the second annual magistrate of the state was\r\ncalled the King, and his wife the Queen; the functions of both were\r\nreligious. Many other Greek democracies had titular kings, whose\r\nduties, so far as they are known, seem to have been priestly, and to\r\nhave centered round the Common Hearth of the state. Some Greek\r\nstates had several of these titular kings, who held office\r\nsimultaneously. At Rome the tradition was that the Sacrificial King\r\nhad been appointed after the abolition of the monarchy in order to\r\noffer the sacrifices which before had been offered by the kings. A\r\nsimilar view as to the origin of the priestly kings appears to have\r\nprevailed in Greece. In itself the opinion is not improbable, and it\r\nis borne out by the example of Sparta, almost the only purely Greek\r\nstate which retained the kingly form of government in historical\r\ntimes. For in Sparta all state sacrifices were offered by the kings\r\nas descendants of the god. One of the two Spartan kings held the\r\npriesthood of Zeus Lacedaemon, the other the priesthood of Heavenly\r\nZeus.\r\n\r\nThis combination of priestly functions with royal authority is\r\nfamiliar to every one. Asia Minor, for example, was the seat of\r\nvarious great religious capitals peopled by thousands of sacred\r\nslaves, and ruled by pontiffs who wielded at once temporal and\r\nspiritual authority, like the popes of mediaeval Rome. Such\r\npriest-ridden cities were Zela and Pessinus. Teutonic kings, again,\r\nin the old heathen days seem to have stood in the position, and to\r\nhave exercised the powers, of high priests. The Emperors of China\r\noffered public sacrifices, the details of which were regulated by\r\nthe ritual books. The King of Madagascar was high-priest of the\r\nrealm. At the great festival of the new year, when a bullock was\r\nsacrificed for the good of the kingdom, the king stood over the\r\nsacrifice to offer prayer and thanksgiving, while his attendants\r\nslaughtered the animal. In the monarchical states which still\r\nmaintain their independence among the Gallas of Eastern Africa, the\r\nking sacrifices on the mountain tops and regulates the immolation of\r\nhuman victims; and the dim light of tradition reveals a similar\r\nunion of temporal and spiritual power, of royal and priestly duties,\r\nin the kings of that delightful region of Central America whose\r\nancient capital, now buried under the rank growth of the tropical\r\nforest, is marked by the stately and mysterious ruins of Palenque.\r\n\r\nWhen we have said that the ancient kings were commonly priests also,\r\nwe are far from having exhausted the religious aspect of their\r\noffice. In those days the divinity that hedges a king was no empty\r\nform of speech, but the expression of a sober belief. Kings were\r\nrevered, in many cases not merely as priests, that is, as\r\nintercessors between man and god, but as themselves gods, able to\r\nbestow upon their subjects and worshippers those blessings which are\r\ncommonly supposed to be beyond the reach of mortals, and are sought,\r\nif at all, only by prayer and sacrifice offered to superhuman and\r\ninvisible beings. Thus kings are often expected to give rain and\r\nsunshine in due season, to make the crops grow, and so on. Strange\r\nas this expectation appears to us, it is quite of a piece with early\r\nmodes of thought. A savage hardly conceives the distinction commonly\r\ndrawn by more advanced peoples between the natural and the\r\nsupernatural. To him the world is to a great extent worked by\r\nsupernatural agents, that is, by personal beings acting on impulses\r\nand motives like his own, liable like him to be moved by appeals to\r\ntheir pity, their hopes, and their fears. In a world so conceived he\r\nsees no limit to his power of influencing the course of nature to\r\nhis own advantage. Prayers, promises, or threats may secure him fine\r\nweather and an abundant crop from the gods; and if a god should\r\nhappen, as he sometimes believes, to become incarnate in his own\r\nperson, then he need appeal to no higher being; he, the savage,\r\npossesses in himself all the powers necessary to further his own\r\nwell-being and that of his fellow-men.\r\n\r\nThis is one way in which the idea of a man-god is reached. But there\r\nis another. Along with the view of the world as pervaded by\r\nspiritual forces, savage man has a different, and probably still\r\nolder, conception in which we may detect a germ of the modern notion\r\nof natural law or the view of nature as a series of events occurring\r\nin an invariable order without the intervention of personal agency.\r\nThe germ of which I speak is involved in that sympathetic magic, as\r\nit may be called, which plays a large part in most systems of\r\nsuperstition. In early society the king is frequently a magician as\r\nwell as a priest; indeed he appears to have often attained to power\r\nby virtue of his supposed proficiency in the black or white art.\r\nHence in order to understand the evolution of the kingship and the\r\nsacred character with which the office has commonly been invested in\r\nthe eyes of savage or barbarous peoples, it is essential to have\r\nsome acquaintance with the principles of magic and to form some\r\nconception of the extraordinary hold which that ancient system of\r\nsuperstition has had on the human mind in all ages and all\r\ncountries. Accordingly I propose to consider the subject in some\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Sympathetic Magic\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Principles of Magic\r\n\r\nIF we analyse the principles of thought on which magic is based,\r\nthey will probably be found to resolve themselves into two: first,\r\nthat like produces like, or that an effect resembles its cause;\r\nand, second, that things which have once been in contact with each\r\nother continue to act on each other at a distance after the\r\nphysical contact has been severed. The former principle may be\r\ncalled the Law of Similarity, the latter the Law of Contact or\r\nContagion. From the first of these principles, namely the Law of\r\nSimilarity, the magician infers that he can produce any effect he\r\ndesires merely by imitating it: from the second he infers that\r\nwhatever he does to a material object will affect equally the\r\nperson with whom the object was once in contact, whether it formed\r\npart of his body or not. Charms based on the Law of Similarity may\r\nbe called Homoeopathic or Imitative Magic. Charms based on the Law\r\nof Contact or Contagion may be called Contagious Magic. To denote\r\nthe first of these branches of magic the term Homoeopathic is\r\nperhaps preferable, for the alternative term Imitative or Mimetic\r\nsuggests, if it does not imply, a conscious agent who imitates,\r\nthereby limiting the scope of magic too narrowly. For the same\r\nprinciples which the magician applies in the practice of his art\r\nare implicitly believed by him to regulate the operations of\r\ninanimate nature; in other words, he tacitly assumes that the Laws\r\nof Similarity and Contact are of universal application and are not\r\nlimited to human actions. In short, magic is a spurious system of\r\nnatural law as well as a fallacious guide of conduct; it is a false\r\nscience as well as an abortive art. Regarded as a system of natural\r\nlaw, that is, as a statement of the rules which determine the\r\nsequence of events throughout the world, it may be called\r\nTheoretical Magic: regarded as a set of precepts which human beings\r\nobserve in order to compass their ends, it may be called Practical\r\nMagic. At the same time it is to be borne in mind that the\r\nprimitive magician knows magic only on its practical side; he never\r\nanalyses the mental processes on which his practice is based, never\r\nreflects on the abstract principles involved in his actions. With\r\nhim, as with the vast majority of men, logic is implicit, not\r\nexplicit: he reasons just as he digests his food in complete\r\nignorance of the intellectual and physiological processes which are\r\nessential to the one operation and to the other. In short, to him\r\nmagic is always an art, never a science; the very idea of science\r\nis lacking in his undeveloped mind. It is for the philosophic\r\nstudent to trace the train of thought which underlies the\r\nmagician\'s practice; to draw out the few simple threads of\r\nwhich the tangled skein is composed; to disengage the abstract\r\nprinciples from their concrete applications; in short, to discern\r\nthe spurious science behind the bastard art.\r\n\r\nIf my analysis of the magician\'s logic is correct, its two great\r\nprinciples turn out to be merely two different misapplications of\r\nthe association of ideas. Homoeopathic magic is founded on the\r\nassociation of ideas by similarity: contagious magic is founded on\r\nthe association of ideas by contiguity. Homoeopathic magic commits\r\nthe mistake of assuming that things which resemble each other are\r\nthe same: contagious magic commits the mistake of assuming that\r\nthings which have once been in contact with each other are always in\r\ncontact. But in practice the two branches are often combined; or, to\r\nbe more exact, while homoeopathic or imitative magic may be\r\npractised by itself, contagious magic will generally be found to\r\ninvolve an application of the homoeopathic or imitative principle.\r\nThus generally stated the two things may be a little difficult to\r\ngrasp, but they will readily become intelligible when they are\r\nillustrated by particular examples. Both trains of thought are in\r\nfact extremely simple and elementary. It could hardly be otherwise,\r\nsince they are familiar in the concrete, though certainly not in the\r\nabstract, to the crude intelligence not only of the savage, but of\r\nignorant and dull-witted people everywhere. Both branches of magic,\r\nthe homoeopathic and the contagious, may conveniently be\r\ncomprehended under the general name of Sympathetic Magic, since both\r\nassume that things act on each other at a distance through a secret\r\nsympathy, the impulse being transmitted from one to the other by\r\nmeans of what we may conceive as a kind of invisible ether, not\r\nunlike that which is postulated by modern science for a precisely\r\nsimilar purpose, namely, to explain how things can physically affect\r\neach other through a space which appears to be empty.\r\n\r\nIt may be convenient to tabulate as follows the branches of\r\nmagic according to the laws of thought which underlie them:\r\n\r\n                   Sympathetic Magic\r\n                   (Law of Sympathy)\r\n                           |\r\n            -------------------------------\r\n            |                             |\r\n    Homoeopathic Magic             Contagious Magic\r\n    (Law of Similarity)            (Law of Contact)\r\n\r\n\r\nI will now illustrate these two great branches of sympathetic\r\nmagic by examples, beginning with homoeopathic magic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Homoeopathic or Imitative Magic\r\n\r\nPERHAPS the most familiar application of the principle that like\r\nproduces like is the attempt which has been made by many peoples in\r\nmany ages to injure or destroy an enemy by injuring or destroying an\r\nimage of him, in the belief that, just as the image suffers, so does\r\nthe man, and that when it perishes he must die. A few instances out\r\nof many may be given to prove at once the wide diffusion of the\r\npractice over the world and its remarkable persistence through the\r\nages. For thousands of years ago it was known to the sorcerers of\r\nancient India, Babylon, and Egypt, as well as of Greece and Rome,\r\nand at this day it is still resorted to by cunning and malignant\r\nsavages in Australia, Africa, and Scotland. Thus the North American\r\nIndians, we are told, believe that by drawing the figure of a person\r\nin sand, ashes, or clay, or by considering any object as his body,\r\nand then pricking it with a sharp stick or doing it any other\r\ninjury, they inflict a corresponding injury on the person\r\nrepresented. For example, when an Ojebway Indian desires to work\r\nevil on any one, he makes a little wooden image of his enemy and\r\nruns a needle into its head or heart, or he shoots an arrow into it,\r\nbelieving that wherever the needle pierces or the arrow strikes the\r\nimage, his foe will the same instant be seized with a sharp pain in\r\nthe corresponding part of his body; but if he intends to kill the\r\nperson outright, he burns or buries the puppet, uttering certain\r\nmagic words as he does so. The Peruvian Indians moulded images of\r\nfat mixed with grain to imitate the persons whom they disliked or\r\nfeared, and then burned the effigy on the road where the intended\r\nvictim was to pass. This they called burning his soul.\r\n\r\nA Malay charm of the same sort is as follows. Take parings of nails,\r\nhair, eyebrows, spittle, and so forth of your intended victim,\r\nenough to represent every part of his person, and then make them up\r\ninto his likeness with wax from a deserted bees\' comb. Scorch the\r\nfigure slowly by holding it over a lamp every night for seven\r\nnights, and say:\r\n\r\n\r\n "It is not wax that I am scorching,\r\n  It is the liver, heart, and spleen of So-and-so that I scorch."\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the seventh time burn the figure, and your victim will die.\r\nThis charm obviously combines the principles of homoeopathic and\r\ncontagious magic; since the image which is made in the likeness of\r\nan enemy contains things which once were in contact with him,\r\nnamely, his nails, hair, and spittle. Another form of the Malay\r\ncharm, which resembles the Ojebway practice still more closely, is\r\nto make a corpse of wax from an empty bees\' comb and of the length\r\nof a footstep; then pierce the eye of the image, and your enemy is\r\nblind; pierce the stomach, and he is sick; pierce the head, and his\r\nhead aches; pierce the breast, and his breast will suffer. If you\r\nwould kill him outright, transfix the image from the head downwards;\r\nenshroud it as you would a corpse; pray over it as if you were\r\npraying over the dead; then bury it in the middle of a path where\r\nyour victim will be sure to step over it. In order that his blood\r\nmay not be on your head, you should say:\r\n\r\n\r\n    "It is not I who am burying him,\r\n     It is Gabriel who is burying him."\r\n\r\n\r\nThus the guilt of the murder will be laid on the shoulders of the\r\narchangel Gabriel, who is a great deal better able to bear it than\r\nyou are.\r\n\r\nIf homoeopathic or imitative magic, working by means of images, has\r\ncommonly been practised for the spiteful purpose of putting\r\nobnoxious people out of the world, it has also, though far more\r\nrarely, been employed with the benevolent intention of helping\r\nothers into it. In other words, it has been used to facilitate\r\nchildbirth and to procure offspring for barren women. Thus among the\r\nBataks of Sumatra a barren woman, who would become a mother, will\r\nmake a wooden image of a child and hold it in her lap, believing\r\nthat this will lead to the fulfilment of her wish. In the Babar\r\nArchipelago, when a woman desires to have a child, she invites a man\r\nwho is himself the father of a large family to pray on her behalf to\r\nUpulero, the spirit of the sun. A doll is made of red cotton, which\r\nthe woman clasps in her arms, as if she would suckle it. Then the\r\nfather of many children takes a fowl and holds it by the legs to the\r\nwoman\'s head, saying, "O Upulero, make use of the fowl; let fall,\r\nlet descend a child, I beseech you, I entreat you, let a child fall\r\nand descend into my hands and on my lap." Then he asks the woman,\r\n"Has the child come?" and she answers, "Yes, it is sucking already."\r\nAfter that the man holds the fowl on the husband\'s head, and mumbles\r\nsome form of words. Lastly, the bird is killed and laid, together\r\nwith some betel, on the domestic place of sacrifice. When the\r\nceremony is over, word goes about in the village that the woman has\r\nbeen brought to bed, and her friends come and congratulate her. Here\r\nthe pretence that a child has been born is a purely magical rite\r\ndesigned to secure, by means of imitation or mimicry, that a child\r\nreally shall be born; but an attempt is made to add to the efficacy\r\nof the rite by means of prayer and sacrifice. To put it otherwise,\r\nmagic is here blent with and reinforced by religion.\r\n\r\nAmong some of the Dyaks of Borneo, when a woman is in hard labour,\r\na wizard is called in, who essays to facilitate the delivery in a\r\nrational manner by manipulating the body of the sufferer. Meantime\r\nanother wizard outside the room exerts himself to attain the same\r\nend by means which we should regard as wholly irrational. He, in\r\nfact, pretends to be the expectant mother; a large stone attached to\r\nhis stomach by a cloth wrapt round his body represents the child in\r\nthe womb, and, following the directions shouted to him by his\r\ncolleague on the real scene of operations, he moves this\r\nmake-believe baby about on his body in exact imitation of the\r\nmovements of the real baby till the infant is born.\r\n\r\nThe same principle of make-believe, so dear to children, has led\r\nother peoples to employ a simulation of birth as a form of adoption,\r\nand even as a mode of restoring a supposed dead person to life. If\r\nyou pretend to give birth to a boy, or even to a great bearded man\r\nwho has not a drop of your blood in his veins, then, in the eyes of\r\nprimitive law and philosophy, that boy or man is really your son to\r\nall intents and purposes. Thus Diodorus tells us that when Zeus\r\npersuaded his jealous wife Hera to adopt Hercules, the goddess got\r\ninto bed, and clasping the burly hero to her bosom, pushed him\r\nthrough her robes and let him fall to the ground in imitation of a\r\nreal birth; and the historian adds that in his own day the same mode\r\nof adopting children was practised by the barbarians. At the present\r\ntime it is said to be still in use in Bulgaria and among the Bosnian\r\nTurks. A woman will take a boy whom she intends to adopt and push or\r\npull him through her clothes; ever afterwards he is regarded as her\r\nvery son, and inherits the whole property of his adoptive parents.\r\nAmong the Berawans of Sarawak, when a woman desires to adopt a\r\ngrownup man or woman, a great many people assemble and have a feast.\r\nThe adopting mother, seated in public on a raised and covered seat,\r\nallows the adopted person to crawl from behind between her legs. As\r\nsoon as he appears in front he is stroked with the sweet-scented\r\nblossoms of the areca palm and tied to a woman. Then the adopting\r\nmother and the adopted son or daughter, thus bound together, waddle\r\nto the end of the house and back again in front of all the\r\nspectators. The tie established between the two by this graphic\r\nimitation of childbirth is very strict; an offence committed against\r\nan adopted child is reckoned more heinous than one committed against\r\na real child. In ancient Greece any man who had been supposed\r\nerroneously to be dead, and for whom in his absence funeral rites\r\nhad been performed, was treated as dead to society till he had gone\r\nthrough the form of being born again. He was passed through a\r\nwoman\'s lap, then washed, dressed in swaddling-clothes, and put out\r\nto nurse. Not until this ceremony had been punctually performed\r\nmight he mix freely with living folk. In ancient India, under\r\nsimilar circumstances, the supposed dead man had to pass the first\r\nnight after his return in a tub filled with a mixture of fat and\r\nwater; there he sat with doubled-up fists and without uttering a\r\nsyllable, like a child in the womb, while over him were performed\r\nall the sacraments that were wont to be celebrated over a pregnant\r\nwoman. Next morning he got out of the tub and went through once more\r\nall the other sacraments he had formerly partaken of from his youth\r\nup; in particular, he married a wife or espoused his old one over\r\nagain with due solemnity.\r\n\r\nAnother beneficent use of homoeopathic magic is to heal or prevent\r\nsickness. The ancient Hindoos performed an elaborate ceremony, based\r\non homoeopathic magic, for the cure of jaundice. Its main drift was\r\nto banish the yellow colour to yellow creatures and yellow things,\r\nsuch as the sun, to which it properly belongs, and to procure for\r\nthe patient a healthy red colour from a living, vigorous source,\r\nnamely, a red bull. With this intention, a priest recited the\r\nfollowing spell: "Up to the sun shall go thy heart-ache and thy\r\njaundice: in the colour of the red bull do we envelop thee! We\r\nenvelop thee in red tints, unto long life. May this person go\r\nunscathed and be free of yellow colour! The cows whose divinity is\r\nRohini, they who, moreover, are themselves red (_rohinih_)--in their\r\nevery form and every strength we do envelop thee. Into the parrots,\r\ninto the thrush, do we put thy jaundice, and, furthermore, into the\r\nyellow wagtail do we put thy jaundice." While he uttered these\r\nwords, the priest, in order to infuse the rosy hue of health into\r\nthe sallow patient, gave him water to sip which was mixed with the\r\nhair of a red bull; he poured water over the animal\'s back and made\r\nthe sick man drink it; he seated him on the skin of a red bull and\r\ntied a piece of the skin to him. Then in order to improve his colour\r\nby thoroughly eradicating the yellow taint, he proceeded thus. He\r\nfirst daubed him from head to foot with a yellow porridge made of\r\ntumeric or curcuma (a yellow plant), set him on a bed, tied three\r\nyellow birds, to wit, a parrot, a thrush, and a yellow wagtail, by\r\nmeans of a yellow string to the foot of the bed; then pouring water\r\nover the patient, he washed off the yellow porridge, and with it no\r\ndoubt the jaundice, from him to the birds. After that, by way of\r\ngiving a final bloom to his complexion, he took some hairs of a red\r\nbull, wrapt them in gold leaf, and glued them to the patient\'s skin.\r\nThe ancients held that if a person suffering from jaundice looked\r\nsharply at a stone-curlew, and the bird looked steadily at him, he\r\nwas cured of the disease. "Such is the nature," says Plutarch, "and\r\nsuch the temperament of the creature that it draws out and receives\r\nthe malady which issues, like a stream, through the eyesight." So\r\nwell recognised among birdfanciers was this valuable property of the\r\nstone-curlew that when they had one of these birds for sale they\r\nkept it carefully covered, lest a jaundiced person should look at it\r\nand be cured for nothing. The virtue of the bird lay not in its\r\ncolour but in its large golden eye, which naturally drew out the\r\nyellow jaundice. Pliny tells of another, or perhaps the same, bird,\r\nto which the Greeks gave their name for jaundice, because if a\r\njaundiced man saw it, the disease left him and slew the bird. He\r\nmentions also a stone which was supposed to cure jaundice because\r\nits hue resembled that of a jaundiced skin.\r\n\r\nOne of the great merits of homoeopathic magic is that it enables the\r\ncure to be performed on the person of the doctor instead of on that\r\nof his victim, who is thus relieved of all trouble and inconvenience,\r\nwhile he sees his medical man writhe in anguish before him. For\r\nexample, the peasants of Perche, in France, labour under the\r\nimpression that a prolonged fit of vomiting is brought about by the\r\npatient\'s stomach becoming unhooked, as they call it, and so falling\r\ndown. Accordingly, a practitioner is called in to restore the organ\r\nto its proper place. After hearing the symptoms he at once throws\r\nhimself into the most horrible contortions, for the purpose of\r\nunhooking his own stomach. Having succeeded in the effort, he next\r\nhooks it up again in another series of contortions and grimaces,\r\nwhile the patient experiences a corresponding relief. Fee five\r\nfrancs. In like manner a Dyak medicine-man, who has been fetched in\r\na case of illness, will lie down and pretend to be dead. He is\r\naccordingly treated like a corpse, is bound up in mats, taken out of\r\nthe house, and deposited on the ground. After about an hour the\r\nother medicine-men loose the pretended dead man and bring him to\r\nlife; and as he recovers, the sick person is supposed to recover\r\ntoo. A cure for a tumour, based on the principle of homoeopathic\r\nmagic, is prescribed by Marcellus of Bordeaux, court physician to\r\nTheodosius the First, in his curious work on medicine. It is as\r\nfollows. Take a root of vervain, cut it across, and hang one end of\r\nit round the patient\'s neck, and the other in the smoke of the fire.\r\nAs the vervain dries up in the smoke, so the tumour will also dry up\r\nand disappear. If the patient should afterwards prove ungrateful to\r\nthe good physician, the man of skill can avenge himself very easily\r\nby throwing the vervain into water; for as the root absorbs the\r\nmoisture once more, the tumour will return. The same sapient writer\r\nrecommends you, if you are troubled with pimples, to watch for a\r\nfalling star, and then instantly, while the star is still shooting\r\nfrom the sky, to wipe the pimples with a cloth or anything that\r\ncomes to hand. Just as the star falls from the sky, so the pimples\r\nwill fall from your body; only you must be very careful not to wipe\r\nthem with your bare hand, or the pimples will be transferred to it.\r\n\r\nFurther, homoeopathic and in general sympathetic magic plays a great\r\npart in the measures taken by the rude hunter or fisherman to secure\r\nan abundant supply of food. On the principle that like produces\r\nlike, many things are done by him and his friends in deliberate\r\nimitation of the result which he seeks to attain; and, on the other\r\nhand, many things are scrupulously avoided because they bear some\r\nmore or less fanciful resemblance to others which would really be\r\ndisastrous.\r\n\r\nNowhere is the theory of sympathetic magic more systematically\r\ncarried into practice for the maintenance of the food supply than in\r\nthe barren regions of Central Australia. Here the tribes are divided\r\ninto a number of totem clans, each of which is charged with the duty\r\nof multiplying their totem for the good of the community by means of\r\nmagical ceremonies. Most of the totems are edible animals and\r\nplants, and the general result supposed to be accomplished by these\r\nceremonies is that of supplying the tribe with food and other\r\nnecessaries. Often the rites consist of an imitation of the effect\r\nwhich the people desire to produce; in other words, their magic is\r\nhomoeopathic or imitative. Thus among the Warramunga the headman of\r\nthe white cockatoo totem seeks to multiply white cockatoos by\r\nholding an effigy of the bird and mimicking its harsh cry. Among the\r\nArunta the men of the witchetty grub totem perform ceremonies for\r\nmultiplying the grub which the other members of the tribe use as\r\nfood. One of the ceremonies is a pantomime representing the\r\nfully-developed insect in the act of emerging from the chrysalis. A\r\nlong narrow structure of branches is set up to imitate the chrysalis\r\ncase of the grub. In this structure a number of men, who have the\r\ngrub for their totem, sit and sing of the creature in its various\r\nstages. Then they shuffle out of it in a squatting posture, and as\r\nthey do so they sing of the insect emerging from the chrysalis. This\r\nis supposed to multiply the numbers of the grubs. Again, in order to\r\nmultiply emus, which are an important article of food, the men of\r\nthe emu totem paint on the ground the sacred design of their totem,\r\nespecially the parts of the emu which they like best to eat, namely,\r\nthe fat and the eggs. Round this painting the men sit and sing.\r\nAfterwards performers, wearing head-dresses to represent the long\r\nneck and small head of the emu, mimic the appearance of the bird as\r\nit stands aimlessly peering about in all directions.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of British Columbia live largely upon the fish which\r\nabound in their seas and rivers. If the fish do not come in due\r\nseason, and the Indians are hungry, a Nootka wizard will make an\r\nimage of a swimming fish and put it into the water in the direction\r\nfrom which the fish generally appear. This ceremony, accompanied by\r\na prayer to the fish to come, will cause them to arrive at once. The\r\nislanders of Torres Straits use models of dugong and turtles to\r\ncharm dugong and turtle to their destruction. The Toradjas of\r\nCentral Celebes believe that things of the same sort attract each\r\nother by means of their indwelling spirits or vital ether. Hence\r\nthey hang up the jawbones of deer and wild pigs in their houses, in\r\norder that the spirits which animate these bones may draw the living\r\ncreatures of the same kind into the path of the hunter. In the\r\nisland of Nias, when a wild pig has fallen into the pit prepared for\r\nit, the animal is taken out and its back is rubbed with nine fallen\r\nleaves, in the belief that this will make nine more wild pigs fall\r\ninto the pit, just as the nine leaves fell from the tree. In the\r\nEast Indian islands of Saparoea, Haroekoe, and Noessa Laut, when a\r\nfisherman is about to set a trap for fish in the sea, he looks out\r\nfor a tree, of which the fruit has been much pecked at by birds.\r\nFrom such a tree he cuts a stout branch and makes of it the\r\nprincipal post in his fish-trap; for he believes that, just as the\r\ntree lured many birds to its fruit, so the branch cut from that tree\r\nwill lure many fish to the trap.\r\n\r\nThe western tribes of British New Guinea employ a charm to aid the\r\nhunter in spearing dugong or turtle. A small beetle, which haunts\r\ncoco-nut trees, is placed in the hole of the spear-haft into which\r\nthe spear-head fits. This is supposed to make the spear-head stick\r\nfast in the dugong or turtle, just as the beetle sticks fast to a\r\nman\'s skin when it bites him. When a Cambodian hunter has set his\r\nnets and taken nothing, he strips himself naked, goes some way off,\r\nthen strolls up to the net as if he did not see it, lets himself be\r\ncaught in it, and cries, "Hillo! what\'s this? I\'m afraid I\'m\r\ncaught." After that the net is sure to catch game. A pantomime of\r\nthe same sort has been acted within the living memory in our\r\nScottish Highlands. The Rev. James Macdonald, now of Reay in\r\nCaithness, tells us that in his boyhood when he was fishing with\r\ncompanions about Loch Aline and they had had no bites for a long\r\ntime, they used to make a pretence of throwing one of their fellows\r\noverboard and hauling him out of the water, as if he were a fish;\r\nafter that the trout or silloch would begin to nibble, according as\r\nthe boat was on fresh or salt water. Before a Carrier Indian goes\r\nout to snare martens, he sleeps by himself for about ten nights\r\nbeside the fire with a little stick pressed down on his neck. This\r\nnaturally causes the fall-stick of his trap to drop down on the neck\r\nof the marten. Among the Galelareese, who inhabit a district in the\r\nnorthern part of Halmahera, a large island to the west of New\r\nGuinea, it is a maxim that when you are loading your gun to go out\r\nshooting, you should always put the bullet in your mouth before you\r\ninsert it in the gun; for by so doing you practically eat the game\r\nthat is to be hit by the bullet, which therefore cannot possibly\r\nmiss the mark. A Malay who has baited a trap for crocodiles, and is\r\nawaiting results, is careful in eating his curry always to begin by\r\nswallowing three lumps of rice successively; for this helps the bait\r\nto slide more easily down the crocodile\'s throat. He is equally\r\nscrupulous not to take any bones out of his curry; for, if he did,\r\nit seems clear that the sharp-pointed stick on which the bait is\r\nskewered would similarly work itself loose, and the crocodile would\r\nget off with the bait. Hence in these circumstances it is prudent\r\nfor the hunter, before he begins his meal, to get somebody else to\r\ntake the bones out of his curry, otherwise he may at any moment have\r\nto choose between swallowing a bone and losing the crocodile.\r\n\r\nThis last rule is an instance of the things which the hunter\r\nabstains from doing lest, on the principle that like produces like,\r\nthey should spoil his luck. For it is to be observed that the system\r\nof sympathetic magic is not merely composed of positive precepts; it\r\ncomprises a very large number of negative precepts, that is,\r\nprohibitions. It tells you not merely what to do, but also what to\r\nleave undone. The positive precepts are charms: the negative\r\nprecepts are taboos. In fact the whole doctrine of taboo, or at all\r\nevents a large part of it, would seem to be only a special\r\napplication of sympathetic magic, with its two great laws of\r\nsimilarity and contact. Though these laws are certainly not\r\nformulated in so many words nor even conceived in the abstract by\r\nthe savage, they are nevertheless implicitly believed by him to\r\nregulate the course of nature quite independently of human will. He\r\nthinks that if he acts in a certain way, certain consequences will\r\ninevitably follow in virtue of one or other of these laws; and if\r\nthe consequences of a particular act appear to him likely to prove\r\ndisagreeable or dangerous, he is naturally careful not to act in\r\nthat way lest he should incur them. In other words, he abstains from\r\ndoing that which, in accordance with his mistaken notions of cause\r\nand effect, he falsely believes would injure him; in short, he\r\nsubjects himself to a taboo. Thus taboo is so far a negative\r\napplication of practical magic. Positive magic or sorcery says, "Do\r\nthis in order that so and so may happen." Negative magic or taboo\r\nsays, "Do not do this, lest so and so should happen." The aim of\r\npositive magic or sorcery is to produce a desired event; the aim of\r\nnegative magic or taboo is to avoid an undesirable one. But both\r\nconsequences, the desirable and the undesirable, are supposed to be\r\nbrought about in accordance with the laws of similarity and contact.\r\nAnd just as the desired consequence is not really effected by the\r\nobservance of a magical ceremony, so the dreaded consequence does\r\nnot really result from the violation of a taboo. If the supposed\r\nevil necessarily followed a breach of taboo, the taboo would not be\r\na taboo but a precept of morality or common sense. It is not a taboo\r\nto say, "Do not put your hand in the fire"; it is a rule of common\r\nsense, because the forbidden action entails a real, not an imaginary\r\nevil. In short, those negative precepts which we call taboo are just\r\nas vain and futile as those positive precepts which we call sorcery.\r\nThe two things are merely opposite sides or poles of one great\r\ndisastrous fallacy, a mistaken conception of the association of\r\nideas. Of that fallacy, sorcery is the positive, and taboo the\r\nnegative pole. If we give the general name of magic to the whole\r\nerroneous system, both theoretical and practical, then taboo may be\r\ndefined as the negative side of practical magic. To put this in\r\ntabular form:\r\n\r\n\r\n                Magic\r\n                  |\r\n       ----------------------\r\n       |                    |\r\n  Theoretical           Practical\r\n  (Magic as a          (Magic as a\r\npseudo-science)         pseudo-art)\r\n                              |\r\n                         -----------------\r\n                         |               |\r\n                    Positive Magic   Negative Magic\r\n\t\t              or Sorcery      or Taboo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have made these remarks on taboo and its relations to magic\r\nbecause I am about to give some instances of taboos observed by\r\nhunters, fishermen, and others, and I wished to show that they fall\r\nunder the head of Sympathetic Magic, being only particular\r\napplications of that general theory. Thus, among the Esquimaux boys\r\nare forbidden to play cat\'s cradle, because if they did so their\r\nfingers might in later life become entangled in the harpoon-line.\r\nHere the taboo is obviously an application of the law of similarity,\r\nwhich is the basis of homoeopathic magic: as the child\'s fingers are\r\nentangled by the string in playing cat\'s cradle, so they will be\r\nentangled by the harpoonline when he is a man and hunts whales.\r\nAgain, among the Huzuls of the Carpathian Mountains the wife of a\r\nhunter may not spin while her husband is eating, or the game will\r\nturn and wind like the spindle, and the hunter will be unable to hit\r\nit. Here again the taboo is clearly derived from the law of\r\nsimilarity. So, too, in most parts of ancient Italy women were\r\nforbidden by law to spin on the highroads as they walked, or even to\r\ncarry their spindles openly, because any such action was believed to\r\ninjure the crops. Probably the notion was that the twirling of the\r\nspindle would twirl the corn-stalks and prevent them from growing\r\nstraight. So, too, among the Ainos of Saghalien a pregnant woman may\r\nnot spin nor twist ropes for two months before her delivery, because\r\nthey think that if she did so the child\'s guts might be entangled\r\nlike the thread. For a like reason in Bilaspore, a district of\r\nIndia, when the chief men of a village meet in council, no one\r\npresent should twirl a spindle; for they think that if such a thing\r\nwere to happen, the discussion, like the spindle, would move in a\r\ncircle and never be wound up. In some of the East Indian islands any\r\none who comes to the house of a hunter must walk straight in; he may\r\nnot loiter at the door, for were he to do so, the game would in like\r\nmanner stop in front of the hunter\'s snares and then turn back,\r\ninstead of being caught in the trap. For a similar reason it is a\r\nrule with the Toradjas of Central Celebes that no one may stand or\r\nloiter on the ladder of a house where there is a pregnant woman, for\r\nsuch delay would retard the birth of the child; and in various parts\r\nof Sumatra the woman herself in these circumstances is forbidden to\r\nstand at the door or on the top rung of the house-ladder under pain\r\nof suffering hard labour for her imprudence in neglecting so\r\nelementary a precaution. Malays engaged in the search for camphor\r\neat their food dry and take care not to pound their salt fine. The\r\nreason is that the camphor occurs in the form of small grains\r\ndeposited in the cracks of the trunk of the camphor tree.\r\nAccordingly it seems plain to the Malay that if, while seeking for\r\ncamphor, he were to eat his salt finely ground, the camphor would be\r\nfound also in fine grains; whereas by eating his salt coarse he\r\nensures that the grains of the camphor will also be large. Camphor\r\nhunters in Borneo use the leathery sheath of the leaf-stalk of the\r\nPenang palm as a plate for food, and during the whole of the\r\nexpedition they will never wash the plate, for fear that the camphor\r\nmight dissolve and disappear from the crevices of the tree.\r\nApparently they think that to wash their plates would be to wash out\r\nthe camphor crystals from the trees in which they are imbedded. The\r\nchief product of some parts of Laos, a province of Siam, is lac.\r\nThis is a resinous gum exuded by a red insect on the young branches\r\nof trees, to which the little creatures have to be attached by hand.\r\nAll who engage in the business of gathering the gum abstain from\r\nwashing themselves and especially from cleansing their heads, lest\r\nby removing the parasites from their hair they should detach the\r\nother insects from the boughs. Again, a Blackfoot Indian who has set\r\na trap for eagles, and is watching it, would not eat rosebuds on any\r\naccount; for he argues that if he did so, and an eagle alighted near\r\nthe trap, the rosebuds in his own stomach would make the bird itch,\r\nwith the result that instead of swallowing the bait the eagle would\r\nmerely sit and scratch himself. Following this train of thought the\r\neagle hunter also refrains from using an awl when he is looking\r\nafter his snares; for surely if he were to scratch with an awl, the\r\neagles would scratch him. The same disastrous consequence would\r\nfollow if his wives and children at home used an awl while he is out\r\nafter eagles, and accordingly they are forbidden to handle the tool\r\nin his absence for fear of putting him in bodily danger.\r\n\r\nAmong the taboos observed by savages none perhaps are more numerous\r\nor important than the prohibitions to eat certain foods, and of such\r\nprohibitions many are demonstrably derived from the law of\r\nsimilarity and are accordingly examples of negative magic. Just as\r\nthe savage eats many animals or plants in order to acquire certain\r\ndesirable qualities with which he believes them to be endowed, so he\r\navoids eating many other animals and plants lest he should acquire\r\ncertain undesirable qualities with which he believes them to be\r\ninfected. In eating the former he practises positive magic; in\r\nabstaining from the latter he practises negative magic. Many\r\nexamples of such positive magic will meet us later on; here I will\r\ngive a few instances of such negative magic or taboo. For example,\r\nin Madagascar soldiers are forbidden to eat a number of foods lest\r\non the principle of homoeopathic magic they should be tainted by\r\ncertain dangerous or undesirable properties which are supposed to\r\ninhere in these particular viands. Thus they may not taste hedgehog,\r\n"as it is feared that this animal, from its propensity of coiling up\r\ninto a ball when alarmed, will impart a timid shrinking disposition\r\nto those who partake of it." Again, no soldier should eat an ox\'s\r\nknee, lest like an ox he should become weak in the knees and unable\r\nto march. Further, the warrior should be careful to avoid partaking\r\nof a cock that has died fighting or anything that has been speared\r\nto death; and no male animal may on any account be killed in his\r\nhouse while he is away at the wars. For it seems obvious that if he\r\nwere to eat a cock that had died fighting, he would himself be slain\r\non the field of battle; if he were to partake of an animal that had\r\nbeen speared, he would be speared himself; if a male animal were\r\nkilled in his house during his absence, he would himself be killed\r\nin like manner and perhaps at the same instant. Further, the\r\nMalagasy soldier must eschew kidneys, because in the Malagasy\r\nlanguage the word for kidney is the same as that for "shot"; so shot\r\nhe would certainly be if he ate a kidney.\r\n\r\nThe reader may have observed that in some of the foregoing examples\r\nof taboos the magical influence is supposed to operate at\r\nconsiderable distances; thus among the Blackfeet Indians the wives\r\nand children of an eagle hunter are forbidden to use an awl during\r\nhis absence, lest the eagles should scratch the distant husband and\r\nfather; and again no male animal may be killed in the house of a\r\nMalagasy soldier while he is away at the wars, lest the killing of\r\nthe animal should entail the killing of the man. This belief in the\r\nsympathetic influence exerted on each other by persons or things at\r\na distance is of the essence of magic. Whatever doubts science may\r\nentertain as to the possibility of action at a distance, magic has\r\nnone; faith in telepathy is one of its first principles. A modern\r\nadvocate of the influence of mind upon mind at a distance would have\r\nno difficulty in convincing a savage; the savage believed in it long\r\nago, and what is more, he acted on his belief with a logical\r\nconsistency such as his civilised brother in the faith has not yet,\r\nso far as I am aware, exhibited in his conduct. For the savage is\r\nconvinced not only that magical ceremonies affect persons and things\r\nafar off, but that the simplest acts of daily life may do so too.\r\nHence on important occasions the behaviour of friends and relations\r\nat a distance is often regulated by a more or less elaborate code of\r\nrules, the neglect of which by the one set of persons would, it is\r\nsupposed, entail misfortune or even death on the absent ones. In\r\nparticular when a party of men are out hunting or fighting, their\r\nkinsfolk at home are often expected to do certain things or to\r\nabstain from doing certain others, for the sake of ensuring the\r\nsafety and success of the distant hunters or warriors. I will now\r\ngive some instances of this magical telepathy both in its positive\r\nand in its negative aspect.\r\n\r\nIn Laos when an elephant hunter is starting for the chase, he warns\r\nhis wife not to cut her hair or oil her body in his absence; for if\r\nshe cut her hair the elephant would burst the toils, if she oiled\r\nherself it would slip through them. When a Dyak village has turned\r\nout to hunt wild pigs in the jungle, the people who stay at home may\r\nnot touch oil or water with their hands during the absence of their\r\nfriends; for if they did so, the hunters would all be\r\n"butter-fingered" and the prey would slip through their hands.\r\n\r\nElephant-hunters in East Africa believe that, if their wives prove\r\nunfaithful in their absence, this gives the elephant power over his\r\npursuer, who will accordingly be killed or severely wounded. Hence\r\nif a hunter hears of his wife\'s misconduct, he abandons the chase\r\nand returns home. If a Wagogo hunter is unsuccessful, or is attacked\r\nby a lion, he attributes it to his wife\'s misbehaviour at home, and\r\nreturns to her in great wrath. While he is away hunting, she may not\r\nlet any one pass behind her or stand in front of her as she sits;\r\nand she must lie on her face in bed. The Moxos Indians of Bolivia\r\nthought that if a hunter\'s wife was unfaithful to him in his absence\r\nhe would be bitten by a serpent or a jaguar. Accordingly, if such an\r\naccident happened to him, it was sure to entail the punishment, and\r\noften the death, of the woman, whether she was innocent or guilty.\r\nAn Aleutian hunter of sea-otters thinks that he cannot kill a single\r\nanimal if during his absence from home his wife should be unfaithful\r\nor his sister unchaste.\r\n\r\nThe Huichol Indians of Mexico treat as a demi-god a species of\r\ncactus which throws the eater into a state of ecstasy. The plant\r\ndoes not grow in their country, and has to be fetched every year by\r\nmen who make a journey of forty-three days for the purpose.\r\nMeanwhile the wives at home contribute to the safety of their absent\r\nhusbands by never walking fast, much less running, while the men are\r\non the road. They also do their best to ensure the benefits which,\r\nin the shape of rain, good crops, and so forth, are expected to flow\r\nfrom the sacred mission. With this intention they subject themselves\r\nto severe restrictions like those imposed upon their husbands.\r\nDuring the whole of the time which elapses till the festival of the\r\ncactus is held, neither party washes except on certain occasions,\r\nand then only with water brought from the distant country where the\r\nholy plant grows. They also fast much, eat no salt, and are bound to\r\nstrict continence. Any one who breaks this law is punished with\r\nillness, and, moreover, jeopardises the result which all are\r\nstriving for. Health, luck, and life are to be gained by gathering\r\nthe cactus, the gourd of the God of Fire; but inasmuch as the pure\r\nfire cannot benefit the impure, men and women must not only remain\r\nchaste for the time being, but must also purge themselves from the\r\ntaint of past sin. Hence four days after the men have started the\r\nwomen gather and confess to Grandfather Fire with what men they have\r\nbeen in love from childhood till now. They may not omit a single\r\none, for if they did so the men would not find a single cactus. So\r\nto refresh their memories each one prepares a string with as many\r\nknots as she has had lovers. This she brings to the temple, and,\r\nstanding before the fire, she mentions aloud all the men she has\r\nscored on her string, name after name. Having ended her confession,\r\nshe throws the string into the fire, and when the god has consumed\r\nit in his pure flame, her sins are forgiven her and she departs in\r\npeace. From now on the women are averse even to letting men pass\r\nnear them. The cactus-seekers themselves make in like manner a clean\r\nbreast of all their frailties. For every peccadillo they tie a knot\r\non a string, and after they have "talked to all the five winds" they\r\ndeliver the rosary of their sins to the leader, who burns it in the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nMany of the indigenous tribes of Sarawak are firmly persuaded that\r\nwere the wives to commit adultery while their husbands are searching\r\nfor camphor in the jungle, the camphor obtained by the men would\r\nevaporate. Husbands can discover, by certain knots in the tree, when\r\nthe wives are unfaithful; and it is said that in former days many\r\nwomen were killed by jealous husbands on no better evidence than\r\nthat of these knots. Further, the wives dare not touch a comb while\r\ntheir husbands are away collecting the camphor; for if they did so,\r\nthe interstices between the fibres of the tree, instead of being\r\nfilled with the precious crystals, would be empty like the spaces\r\nbetween the teeth of a comb. In the Kei Islands, to the southwest of\r\nNew Guinea, as soon as a vessel that is about to sail for a distant\r\nport has been launched, the part of the beach on which it lay is\r\ncovered as speedily as possible with palm branches, and becomes\r\nsacred. No one may thenceforth cross that spot till the ship comes\r\nhome. To cross it sooner would cause the vessel to perish. Moreover,\r\nall the time that the voyage lasts three or four young girls,\r\nspecially chosen for the duty, are supposed to remain in sympathetic\r\nconnexion with the mariners and to contribute by their behaviour to\r\nthe safety and success of the voyage. On no account, except for the\r\nmost necessary purpose, may they quit the room that has been\r\nassigned to them. More than that, so long as the vessel is believed\r\nto be at sea they must remain absolutely motionless, crouched on\r\ntheir mats with their hands clasped between their knees. They may\r\nnot turn their heads to the left or to the right or make any other\r\nmovement whatsoever. If they did, it would cause the boat to pitch\r\nand toss; and they may not eat any sticky stuff, such as rice boiled\r\nin coco-nut milk, for the stickiness of the food would clog the\r\npassage of the boat through the water. When the sailors are supposed\r\nto have reached their destination, the strictness of these rules is\r\nsomewhat relaxed; but during the whole time that the voyage lasts\r\nthe girls are forbidden to eat fish which have sharp bones or\r\nstings, such as the sting-ray, lest their friends at sea should be\r\ninvolved in sharp, stinging trouble.\r\n\r\nWhere beliefs like these prevail as to the sympathetic connexion\r\nbetween friends at a distance, we need not wonder that above\r\neverything else war, with its stern yet stirring appeal to some of\r\nthe deepest and tenderest of human emotions, should quicken in the\r\nanxious relations left behind a desire to turn the sympathetic bond\r\nto the utmost account for the benefit of the dear ones who may at\r\nany moment be fighting and dying far away. Hence, to secure an end\r\nso natural and laudable, friends at home are apt to resort to\r\ndevices which will strike us as pathetic or ludicrous, according as\r\nwe consider their object or the means adopted to effect it. Thus in\r\nsome districts of Borneo, when a Dyak is out head-hunting, his wife\r\nor, if he is unmarried, his sister must wear a sword day and night\r\nin order that he may always be thinking of his weapons; and she may\r\nnot sleep during the day nor go to bed before two in the morning,\r\nlest her husband or brother should thereby be surprised in his sleep\r\nby an enemy. Among the Sea Dyaks of Banting in Sarawak the women\r\nstrictly observe an elaborate code of rules while the men are away\r\nfighting. Some of the rules are negative and some are positive, but\r\nall alike are based on the principles of magical homoeopathy and\r\ntelepathy. Amongst them are the following. The women must wake very\r\nearly in the morning and open the windows as soon as it is light;\r\notherwise their absent husbands will oversleep themselves. The women\r\nmay not oil their hair, or the men will slip. The women may neither\r\nsleep nor doze by day, or the men will be drowsy on the march. The\r\nwomen must cook and scatter popcorn on the verandah every morning;\r\nso will the men be agile in their movements. The rooms must be kept\r\nvery tidy, all boxes being placed near the walls; for if any one\r\nwere to stumble over them, the absent husbands would fall and be at\r\nthe mercy of the foe. At every meal a little rice must be left in\r\nthe pot and put aside; so will the men far away always have\r\nsomething to eat and need never go hungry. On no account may the\r\nwomen sit at the loom till their legs grow cramped, otherwise their\r\nhusbands will likewise be stiff in their joints and unable to rise\r\nup quickly or to run away from the foe. So in order to keep their\r\nhusbands\' joints supple the women often vary their labours at the\r\nloom by walking up and down the verandah. Further, they may not\r\ncover up their faces, or the men would not to be able to find their\r\nway through the tall grass or jungle. Again, the women may not sew\r\nwith a needle, or the men will tread on the sharp spikes set by the\r\nenemy in the path. Should a wife prove unfaithful while her husband\r\nis away, he will lose his life in the enemy\'s country. Some years\r\nago all these rules and more were observed by the women of Banting,\r\nwhile their husbands were fighting for the English against rebels.\r\nBut alas! these tender precautions availed them little; for many a\r\nman, whose faithful wife was keeping watch and ward for him at home,\r\nfound a soldier\'s grave.\r\n\r\nIn the island of Timor, while war is being waged, the high-priest\r\nnever quits the temple; his food is brought to him or cooked inside;\r\nday and night he must keep the fire burning, for if he were to let\r\nit die out, disaster would be fall the warriors and would continue\r\nso long as the hearth was cold. Moreover, he must drink only hot\r\nwater during the time the army is absent; for every draught of cold\r\nwater would damp the spirits of the people, so that they could not\r\nvanquish the enemy. In the Kei Islands, when the warriors have\r\ndeparted, the women return indoors and bring out certain baskets\r\ncontaining fruits and stones. These fruits and stones they anoint\r\nand place on a board, murmuring as they do so, "O lord sun, moon,\r\nlet the bullets rebound from our husbands, brothers, betrothed, and\r\nother relations, just as raindrops rebound from these objects which\r\nare smeared with oil." As soon as the first shot is heard, the\r\nbaskets are put aside, and the women, seizing their fans, rush out\r\nof the houses. Then, waving their fans in the direction of the\r\nenemy, they run through the village, while they sing, "O golden\r\nfans! let our bullets hit, and those of the enemy miss." In this\r\ncustom the ceremony of anointing stones, in order that the bullets\r\nmay recoil from the men like raindrops from the stones, is a piece\r\nof pure homoeopathic or imitative magic; but the prayer to the sun,\r\nthat he will be pleased to give effect to the charm, is a religious\r\nand perhaps later addition. The waving of the fans seems to be a\r\ncharm to direct the bullets towards or away from their mark,\r\naccording as they are discharged from the guns of friends or foes.\r\n\r\nAn old historian of Madagascar informs us that "while the men are at\r\nthe wars, and until their return, the women and girls cease not day\r\nand night to dance, and neither lie down nor take food in their own\r\nhouses. And although they are very voluptuously inclined, they would\r\nnot for anything in the world have an intrigue with another man\r\nwhile their husband is at the war, believing firmly that if that\r\nhappened, their husband would be either killed or wounded. They\r\nbelieve that by dancing they impart strength, courage, and good\r\nfortune to their husbands; accordingly during such times they give\r\nthemselves no rest, and this custom they observe very religiously."\r\n\r\nAmong the Tshi-speaking peoples of the Gold Coast the wives of men\r\nwho are away with the army paint themselves white, and adorn their\r\npersons with beads and charms. On the day when a battle is expected\r\nto take place, they run about armed with guns, or sticks carved to\r\nlook like guns, and taking green paw-paws (fruits shaped somewhat\r\nlike a melon), they hack them with knives, as if they were chopping\r\noff the heads of the foe. The pantomime is no doubt merely an\r\nimitative charm, to enable the men to do to the enemy as the women\r\ndo to the paw-paws. In the West African town of Framin, while the\r\nAshantee war was raging some years ago, Mr. Fitzgerald Marriott saw\r\na dance performed by women whose husbands had gone as carriers to\r\nthe war. They were painted white and wore nothing but a short\r\npetticoat. At their head was a shrivelled old sorceress in a very\r\nshort white petticoat, her black hair arranged in a sort of long\r\nprojecting horn, and her black face, breasts, arms, and legs\r\nprofusely adorned with white circles and crescents. All carried long\r\nwhite brushes made of buffalo or horse tails, and as they danced\r\nthey sang, "Our husbands have gone to Ashanteeland; may they sweep\r\ntheir enemies off the face of the earth!"\r\n\r\nAmong the Thompson Indians of British Columbia, when the men were on\r\nthe war-path, the women performed dances at frequent intervals.\r\nThese dances were believed to ensure the success of the expedition.\r\nThe dancers flourished their knives, threw long sharp-pointed sticks\r\nforward, or drew sticks with hooked ends repeatedly backward and\r\nforward. Throwing the sticks forward was symbolic of piercing or\r\nwarding off the enemy, and drawing them back was symbolic of drawing\r\ntheir own men from danger. The hook at the end of the stick was\r\nparticularly well adapted to serve the purpose of a life-saving\r\napparatus. The women always pointed their weapons towards the\r\nenemy\'s country. They painted their faces red and sang as they\r\ndanced, and they prayed to the weapons to preserve their husbands\r\nand help them to kill many foes. Some had eagle-down stuck on the\r\npoints of their sticks. When the dance was over, these weapons were\r\nhidden. If a woman whose husband was at the war thought she saw hair\r\nor a piece of a scalp on the weapon when she took it out, she knew\r\nthat her husband had killed an enemy. But if she saw a stain of\r\nblood on it, she knew he was wounded or dead. When the men of the\r\nYuki tribe in California were away fighting, the women at home did\r\nnot sleep; they danced continually in a circle, chanting and waving\r\nleafy wands. For they said that if they danced all the time, their\r\nhusbands would not grow tired. Among the Haida Indians of the Queen\r\nCharlotte Islands, when the men had gone to war, the women at home\r\nwould get up very early in the morning and pretend to make war by\r\nfalling upon their children and feigning to take them for slaves.\r\nThis was supposed to help their husbands to go and do likewise. If a\r\nwife were unfaithful to her husband while he was away on the\r\nwar-path, he would probably be killed. For ten nights all the women\r\nat home lay with their heads towards the point of the compass to\r\nwhich the war-canoes had paddled away. Then they changed about, for\r\nthe warriors were supposed to be coming home across the sea. At\r\nMasset the Haida women danced and sang war-songs all the time their\r\nhusbands were away at the wars, and they had to keep everything\r\nabout them in a certain order. It was thought that a wife might kill\r\nher husband by not observing these customs. When a band of Carib\r\nIndians of the Orinoco had gone on the war-path, their friends left\r\nin the village used to calculate as nearly as they could the exact\r\nmoment when the absent warriors would be advancing to attack the\r\nenemy. Then they took two lads, laid them down on a bench, and\r\ninflicted a most severe scourging on their bare backs. This the\r\nyouths submitted to without a murmur, supported in their sufferings\r\nby the firm conviction, in which they had been bred from childhood,\r\nthat on the constancy and fortitude with which they bore the cruel\r\nordeal depended the valour and success of their comrades in the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nAmong the many beneficent uses to which a mistaken ingenuity has\r\napplied the principle of homoeopathic or imitative magic, is that of\r\ncausing trees and plants to bear fruit in due season. In Th\xfcringen\r\nthe man who sows flax carries the seed in a long bag which reaches\r\nfrom his shoulders to his knees, and he walks with long strides, so\r\nthat the bag sways to and fro on his back. It is believed that this\r\nwill cause the flax to wave in the wind. In the interior of Sumatra\r\nrice is sown by women who, in sowing, let their hair hang loose down\r\ntheir back, in order that the rice may grow luxuriantly and have\r\nlong stalks. Similarly, in ancient Mexico a festival was held in\r\nhonour of the goddess of maize, or "the long-haired mother," as she\r\nwas called. It began at the time "when the plant had attained its\r\nfull growth, and fibres shooting forth from the top of the green ear\r\nindicated that the grain was fully formed. During this festival the\r\nwomen wore their long hair unbound, shaking and tossing it in the\r\ndances which were the chief feature in the ceremonial, in order that\r\nthe tassel of the maize might grow in like profusion, that the grain\r\nmight be correspondingly large and flat, and that the people might\r\nhave abundance." In many parts of Europe dancing or leaping high in\r\nthe air are approved homoeopathic modes of making the crops grow\r\nhigh. Thus in Franche-Comt\xe9 they say that you should dance at the\r\nCarnival in order to make the hemp grow tall.\r\n\r\nThe notion that a person can influence a plant homoeopathically by\r\nhis act or condition comes out clearly in a remark made by a Malay\r\nwoman. Being asked why she stripped the upper part of her body naked\r\nin reaping the rice, she explained that she did it to make the\r\nrice-husks thinner, as she was tired of pounding thick-husked rice.\r\nClearly, she thought that the less clothing she wore the less husk\r\nthere would be on the rice. The magic virtue of a pregnant woman to\r\ncommunicate fertility is known to Bavarian and Austrian peasants,\r\nwho think that if you give the first fruit of a tree to a woman with\r\nchild to eat, the tree will bring forth abundantly next year. On the\r\nother hand, the Baganda believe that a barren wife infects her\r\nhusband\'s garden with her own sterility and prevents the trees from\r\nbearing fruit; hence a childless woman is generally divorced. The\r\nGreeks and Romans sacrificed pregnant victims to the goddesses of\r\nthe corn and of the earth, doubtless in order that the earth might\r\nteem and the corn swell in the ear. When a Catholic priest\r\nremonstrated with the Indians of the Orinoco on allowing their women\r\nto sow the fields in the blazing sun, with infants at their breasts,\r\nthe men answered, "Father, you don\'t understand these things, and\r\nthat is why they vex you. You know that women are accustomed to bear\r\nchildren, and that we men are not. When the women sow, the stalk of\r\nthe maize bears two or three ears, the root of the yucca yields two\r\nor three basketfuls, and everything multiplies in proportion. Now\r\nwhy is that? Simply because the women know how to bring forth, and\r\nknow how to make the seed which they sow bring forth also. Let them\r\nsow, then; we men don\'t know as much about it as they do."\r\n\r\nThus on the theory of homoeopathic magic a person can influence\r\nvegetation either for good or for evil according to the good or the\r\nbad character of his acts or states: for example, a fruitful woman\r\nmakes plants fruitful, a barren woman makes them barren. Hence this\r\nbelief in the noxious and infectious nature of certain personal\r\nqualities or accidents has given rise to a number of prohibitions or\r\nrules of avoidance: people abstain from doing certain things lest\r\nthey should homoeopathically infect the fruits of the earth with\r\ntheir own undesirable state or condition. All such customs of\r\nabstention or rules of avoidance are examples of negative magic or\r\ntaboo. Thus, for example, arguing from what may be called the\r\ninfectiousness of personal acts or states, the Galelareese say that\r\nyou ought not to shoot with a bow and arrows under a fruit-tree, or\r\nthe tree will cast its fruit even as the arrows fall to the ground;\r\nand that when you are eating water-melon you ought not to mix the\r\npips which you spit out of your mouth with the pips which you have\r\nput aside to serve as seed; for if you do, though the pips you spat\r\nout may certainly spring up and blossom, yet the blossoms will keep\r\nfalling off just as the pips fell from your mouth, and thus these\r\npips will never bear fruit. Precisely the same train of thought\r\nleads the Bavarian peasant to believe that if he allows the graft of\r\na fruit-tree to fall on the ground, the tree that springs from that\r\ngraft will let its fruit fall untimely. When the Chams of\r\nCochinchina are sowing their dry rice fields and desire that no\r\nshower should fall, they eat their rice dry in order to prevent rain\r\nfrom spoiling the crop.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing cases a person is supposed to influence vegetation\r\nhomoeopathically. He infects trees or plants with qualities or\r\naccidents, good or bad, resembling and derived from his own. But on\r\nthe principle of homoeopathic magic the influence is mutual: the\r\nplant can infect the man just as much as the man can infect the\r\nplant. In magic, as I believe in physics, action and reaction are\r\nequal and opposite. The Cherokee Indians are adepts in practical\r\nbotany of the homoeopathic sort. Thus wiry roots of the catgut plant\r\nare so tough that they can almost stop a plowshare in the furrow.\r\nHence Cherokee women wash their heads with a decoction of the roots\r\nto make the hair strong, and Cherokee ball-players wash themselves\r\nwith it to toughen their muscles. It is a Galelareese belief that if\r\nyou eat a fruit which has fallen to the ground, you will yourself\r\ncontract a disposition to stumble and fall; and that if you partake\r\nof something which has been forgotten (such as a sweet potato left\r\nin the pot or a banana in the fire), you will become forgetful. The\r\nGalelareese are also of opinion that if a woman were to consume two\r\nbananas growing from a single head she would give birth to twins.\r\nThe Guarani Indians of South America thought that a woman would\r\nbecome a mother of twins if she ate a double grain of millet. In\r\nVedic times a curious application of this principle supplied a charm\r\nby which a banished prince might be restored to his kingdom. He had\r\nto eat food cooked on a fire which was fed with wood which had grown\r\nout of the stump of a tree which had been cut down. The recuperative\r\npower manifested by such a tree would in due course be communicated\r\nthrough the fire to the food, and so to the prince, who ate the food\r\nwhich was cooked on the fire which was fed with the wood which grew\r\nout of the tree. The Sudanese think that if a house is built of the\r\nwood of thorny trees, the life of the people who dwell in that house\r\nwill likewise be thorny and full of trouble.\r\n\r\nThere is a fruitful branch of homoeopathic magic which works by\r\nmeans of the dead; for just as the dead can neither see nor hear nor\r\nspeak, so you may on homoeopathic principles render people blind,\r\ndeaf and dumb by the use of dead men\'s bones or anything else that\r\nis tainted by the infection of death. Thus among the Galelareese,\r\nwhen a young man goes a-wooing at night, he takes a little earth\r\nfrom a grave and strews it on the roof of his sweetheart\'s house\r\njust above the place where her parents sleep. This, he fancies, will\r\nprevent them from waking while he converses with his beloved, since\r\nthe earth from the grave will make them sleep as sound as the dead.\r\nBurglars in all ages and many lands have been patrons of this\r\nspecies of magic, which is very useful to them in the exercise of\r\ntheir profession. Thus a South Slavonian housebreaker sometimes\r\nbegins operations by throwing a dead man\'s bone over the house,\r\nsaying, with pungent sarcasm, "As this bone may waken, so may these\r\npeople waken"; after that not a soul in the house can keep his or\r\nher eyes open. Similarly, in Java the burglar takes earth from a\r\ngrave and sprinkles it round the house which he intends to rob; this\r\nthrows the inmates into a deep sleep. With the same intention a\r\nHindoo will strew ashes from a pyre at the door of the house;\r\nIndians of Peru scatter the dust of dead men\'s bones; and Ruthenian\r\nburglars remove the marrow from a human shin-bone, pour tallow into\r\nit, and having kindled the tallow, march thrice round the house with\r\nthis candle burning, which causes the inmates to sleep a death-like\r\nsleep. Or the Ruthenian will make a flute out of a human leg-bone\r\nand play upon it; whereupon all persons within hearing are overcome\r\nwith drowsiness. The Indians of Mexico employed for this maleficent\r\npurpose the left fore-arm of a woman who had died in giving birth to\r\nher first child; but the arm had to be stolen. With it they beat the\r\nground before they entered the house which they designed to plunder;\r\nthis caused every one in the house to lose all power of speech and\r\nmotion; they were as dead, hearing and seeing everything, but\r\nperfectly powerless; some of them, however, really slept and even\r\nsnored. In Europe similar properties were ascribed to the Hand of\r\nGlory, which was the dried and pickled hand of a man who had been\r\nhanged. If a candle made of the fat of a malefactor who had also\r\ndied on the gallows was lighted and placed in the Hand of Glory as\r\nin a candlestick, it rendered motionless all persons to whom it was\r\npresented; they could not stir a finger any more than if they were\r\ndead. Sometimes the dead man\'s hand is itself the candle, or rather\r\nbunch of candles, all its withered fingers being set on fire; but\r\nshould any member of the household be awake, one of the fingers will\r\nnot kindle. Such nefarious lights can only be extinguished with\r\nmilk. Often it is prescribed that the thief\'s candle should be made\r\nof the finger of a new-born or, still better, unborn child;\r\nsometimes it is thought needful that the thief should have one such\r\ncandle for every person in the house, for if he has one candle too\r\nlittle somebody in the house will wake and catch him. Once these\r\ntapers begin to burn, there is nothing but milk that will put them\r\nout. In the seventeenth century robbers used to murder pregnant\r\nwomen in order thus to extract candles from their wombs. An ancient\r\nGreek robber or burglar thought he could silence and put to flight\r\nthe fiercest watchdogs by carrying with him a brand plucked from a\r\nfuneral pyre. Again, Servian and Bulgarian women who chafe at the\r\nrestraints of domestic life will take the copper coins from the eyes\r\nof a corpse, wash them in wine or water, and give the liquid to\r\ntheir husbands to drink. After swallowing it, the husband will be as\r\nblind to his wife\'s peccadilloes as the dead man was on whose eyes\r\nthe coins were laid.\r\n\r\nFurther, animals are often conceived to possess qualities of\r\nproperties which might be useful to man, and homoeopathic or\r\nimitative magic seeks to communicate these properties to human\r\nbeings in various ways. Thus some Bechuanas wear a ferret as a\r\ncharm, because, being very tenacious of life, it will make them\r\ndifficult to kill. Others wear a certain insect, mutilated, but\r\nliving, for a similar purpose. Yet other Bechuana warriors wear the\r\nhair of a hornless ox among their own hair, and the skin of a frog\r\non their mantle, because a frog is slippery, and the ox, having no\r\nhorns, is hard to catch; so the man who is provided with these\r\ncharms believes that he will be as hard to hold as the ox and the\r\nfrog. Again, it seems plain that a South African warrior who twists\r\ntufts of rat\'s hair among his own curly black locks will have just\r\nas many chances of avoiding the enemy\'s spear as the nimble rat has\r\nof avoiding things thrown at it; hence in these regions rats\' hair\r\nis in great demand when war is expected. One of the ancient books of\r\nIndia prescribes that when a sacrifice is offered for victory, the\r\nearth out of which the altar is to be made should be taken from a\r\nplace where a boar has been wallowing, since the strength of the\r\nboar will be in that earth. When you are playing the one-stringed\r\nlute, and your fingers are stiff, the thing to do is to catch some\r\nlong-legged field spiders and roast them, and then rub your fingers\r\nwith the ashes; that will make your fingers as lithe and nimble as\r\nthe spiders\' legs--at least so think the Galelareese. To bring back\r\na runaway slave an Arab will trace a magic circle on the ground,\r\nstick a nail in the middle of it, and attach a beetle by a thread to\r\nthe nail, taking care that the sex of the beetle is that of the\r\nfugitive. As the beetle crawls round and round, it will coil the\r\nthread about the nail, thus shortening its tether and drawing nearer\r\nto the centre at every circuit. So by virtue of homoeopathic magic\r\nthe runaway slave will be drawn back to his master.\r\n\r\nAmong the western tribes of British New Guinea, a man who has killed\r\na snake will burn it and smear his legs with the ashes when he goes\r\ninto the forest; for no snake will bite him for some days\r\nafterwards. If a South Slavonian has a mind to pilfer and steal at\r\nmarket, he has nothing to do but to burn a blind cat, and then throw\r\na pinch of its ashes over the person with whom he is higgling; after\r\nthat he can take what he likes from the booth, and the owner will\r\nnot be a bit the wiser, having become as blind as the deceased cat\r\nwith whose ashes he has been sprinkled. The thief may even ask\r\nboldly, "Did I pay for it?" and the deluded huckster will reply,\r\n"Why, certainly." Equally simple and effectual is the expedient\r\nadopted by natives of Central Australia who desire to cultivate\r\ntheir beards. They prick the chin all over with a pointed bone, and\r\nthen stroke it carefully with a magic stick or stone, which\r\nrepresents a kind of rat that has very long whiskers. The virtue of\r\nthese whiskers naturally passes into the representative stick or\r\nstone, and thence by an easy transition to the chin, which,\r\nconsequently, is soon adorned with a rich growth of beard. The\r\nancient Greeks thought that to eat the flesh of the wakeful\r\nnightingale would prevent a man from sleeping; that to smear the\r\neyes of a blear-sighted person with the gall of an eagle would give\r\nhim the eagle\'s vision; and that a raven\'s eggs would restore the\r\nblackness of the raven to silvery hair. Only the person who adopted\r\nthis last mode of concealing the ravages of time had to be most\r\ncareful to keep his mouth full of oil all the time he applied the\r\neggs to his venerable locks, else his teeth as well as his hair\r\nwould be dyed raven black, and no amount of scrubbing and scouring\r\nwould avail to whiten them again. The hair-restorer was in fact a\r\nshade too powerful, and in applying it you might get more than you\r\nbargained for.\r\n\r\nThe Huichol Indians admire the beautiful markings on the backs of\r\nserpents. Hence when a Huichol woman is about to weave or embroider,\r\nher husband catches a large serpent and holds it in a cleft stick,\r\nwhile the woman strokes the reptile with one hand down the whole\r\nlength of its back; then she passes the same hand over her forehead\r\nand eyes, that she may be able to work as beautiful patterns in the\r\nweb as the markings on the back of the serpent.\r\n\r\nOn the principle of homoeopathic magic, inanimate things, as well as\r\nplants and animals, may diffuse blessing or bane around them,\r\naccording to their own intrinsic nature and the skill of the wizard\r\nto tap or dam, as the case may be, the stream of weal or woe. In\r\nSamaracand women give a baby sugar candy to suck and put glue in the\r\npalm of its hand, in order that, when the child grows up, his words\r\nmay be sweet and precious things may stick to his hands as if they\r\nwere glued. The Greeks thought that a garment made from the fleece\r\nof a sheep that had been torn by a wolf would hurt the wearer,\r\nsetting up an itch or irritation in his skin. They were also of\r\nopinion that if a stone which had been bitten by a dog were dropped\r\nin wine, it would make all who drank of that wine to fall out among\r\nthemselves. Among the Arabs of Moab a childless woman often borrows\r\nthe robe of a woman who has had many children, hoping with the robe\r\nto acquire the fruitfulness of its owner. The Caffres of Sofala, in\r\nEast Africa, had a great dread of being struck with anything hollow,\r\nsuch as a reed or a straw, and greatly preferred being thrashed with\r\na good thick cudgel or an iron bar, even though it hurt very much.\r\nFor they thought that if a man were beaten with anything hollow, his\r\ninside would waste away till he died. In eastern seas there is a\r\nlarge shell which the Buginese of Celebes call the "old man"\r\n(_kadj\xe2wo_). On Fridays they turn these "old men" upside down and\r\nplace them on the thresholds of their houses, believing that whoever\r\nthen steps over the threshold of the house will live to be old. At\r\ninitiation a Brahman boy is made to tread with his right foot on a\r\nstone, while the words are repeated, "Tread on this stone; like a\r\nstone be firm"; and the same ceremony is performed, with the same\r\nwords, by a Brahman bride at her marriage. In Madagascar a mode of\r\ncounteracting the levity of fortune is to bury a stone at the foot\r\nof the heavy house-post. The common custom of swearing upon a stone\r\nmay be based partly on a belief that the strength and stability of\r\nthe stone lend confirmation to an oath. Thus the old Danish\r\nhistorian Saxo Grammaticus tells us that "the ancients, when they\r\nwere to choose a king, were wont to stand on stones planted in the\r\nground, and to proclaim their votes, in order to foreshadow from the\r\nsteadfastness of the stones that the deed would be lasting."\r\n\r\nBut while a general magical efficacy may be supposed to reside in\r\nall stones by reason of their common properties of weight and\r\nsolidity, special magical virtues are attributed to particular\r\nstones, or kinds of stone, in accordance with their individual or\r\nspecific qualities of shape and colour. For example, the Indians of\r\nPeru employed certain stones for the increase of maize, others for\r\nthe increase of potatoes, and others again for the increase of\r\ncattle. The stones used to make maize grow were fashioned in the\r\nlikeness of cobs of maize, and the stones destined to multiply\r\ncattle had the shape of sheep.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Melanesia a like belief prevails that certain\r\nsacred stones are endowed with miraculous powers which correspond in\r\ntheir nature to the shape of the stone. Thus a piece of water-worn\r\ncoral on the beach often bears a surprising likeness to a\r\nbread-fruit. Hence in the Banks Islands a man who finds such a coral\r\nwill lay it at the root of one of his bread-fruit trees in the\r\nexpectation that it will make the tree bear well. If the result\r\nanswers his expectation, he will then, for a proper remuneration,\r\ntake stones of less-marked character from other men and let them lie\r\nnear his, in order to imbue them with the magic virtue which resides\r\nin it. Similarly, a stone with little discs upon it is good to bring\r\nin money; and if a man found a large stone with a number of small\r\nones under it, like a sow among her litter, he was sure that to\r\noffer money upon it would bring him pigs. In these and similar cases\r\nthe Melanesians ascribe the marvellous power, not to the stone\r\nitself, but to its indwelling spirit; and sometimes, as we have just\r\nseen, a man endeavours to propitiate the spirit by laying down\r\nofferings on the stone. But the conception of spirits that must be\r\npropitiated lies outside the sphere of magic, and within that of\r\nreligion. Where such a conception is found, as here, in conjunction\r\nwith purely magical ideas and practices, the latter may generally be\r\nassumed to be the original stock on which the religious conception\r\nhas been at some later time engrafted. For there are strong grounds\r\nfor thinking that, in the evolution of thought, magic has preceded\r\nreligion. But to this point we shall return presently.\r\n\r\nThe ancients set great store on the magical qualities of precious\r\nstones; indeed it has been maintained, with great show of reason,\r\nthat such stones were used as amulets long before they were worn as\r\nmere ornaments. Thus the Greeks gave the name of tree-agate to a\r\nstone which exhibits tree-like markings, and they thought that if\r\ntwo of these gems were tied to the horns or necks of oxen at the\r\nplough, the crop would be sure to be plentiful. Again, they\r\nrecognised a milkstone which produced an abundant supply of milk in\r\nwomen if only they drank it dissolved in honey-mead. Milk-stones are\r\nused for the same purpose by Greek women in Crete and Melos at the\r\npresent day; in Albania nursing mothers wear the stones in order to\r\nensure an abundant flow of milk. Again, the Greeks believed in a\r\nstone which cured snake-bites, and hence was named the snake-stone;\r\nto test its efficacy you had only to grind the stone to powder and\r\nsprinkle the powder on the wound. The wine-coloured amethyst\r\nreceived its name, which means "not drunken," because it was\r\nsupposed to keep the wearer of it sober; and two brothers who\r\ndesired to live at unity were advised to carry magnets about with\r\nthem, which, by drawing the twain together, would clearly prevent\r\nthem from falling out.\r\n\r\nThe ancient books of the Hindoos lay down a rule that after sunset\r\non his marriage night a man should sit silent with his wife till the\r\nstars begin to twinkle in the sky. When the pole-star appears, he\r\nshould point it out to her, and, addressing the star, say, "Firm art\r\nthou; I see thee, the firm one. Firm be thou with me, O thriving\r\none!" Then, turning to his wife, he should say, "To me Brihaspati\r\nhas given thee; obtaining offspring through me, thy husband, live\r\nwith me a hundred autumns." The intention of the ceremony is plainly\r\nto guard against the fickleness of fortune and the instability of\r\nearthly bliss by the steadfast influence of the constant star. It is\r\nthe wish expressed in Keats\'s last sonnet:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Bright star! would I were steadfast as thou art--\r\n    Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night.\r\n\r\n\r\nDwellers by the sea cannot fail to be impressed by the sight of its\r\nceaseless ebb and flow, and are apt, on the principles of that rude\r\nphilosophy of sympathy and resemblance which here engages our\r\nattention, to trace a subtle relation, a secret harmony, between its\r\ntides and the life of man, of animals, and of plants. In the flowing\r\ntide they see not merely a symbol, but a cause of exuberance, of\r\nprosperity, and of life, while in the ebbing tide they discern a\r\nreal agent as well as a melancholy emblem of failure, of weakness,\r\nand of death. The Breton peasant fancies that clover sown when the\r\ntide is coming in will grow well, but that if the plant be sown at\r\nlow water or when the tide is going out, it will never reach\r\nmaturity, and that the cows which feed on it will burst. His wife\r\nbelieves that the best butter is made when the tide has just turned\r\nand is beginning to flow, that milk which foams in the churn will go\r\non foaming till the hour of high water is past, and that water drawn\r\nfrom the well or milk extracted from the cow while the tide is\r\nrising will boil up in the pot or saucepan and overflow into the\r\nfire. According to some of the ancients, the skins of seals, even\r\nafter they had been parted from their bodies, remained in secret\r\nsympathy with the sea, and were observed to ruffle when the tide was\r\non the ebb. Another ancient belief, attributed to Aristotle, was\r\nthat no creature can die except at ebb tide. The belief, if we can\r\ntrust Pliny, was confirmed by experience, so far as regards human\r\nbeings, on the coast of France. Philostratus also assures us that at\r\nCadiz dying people never yielded up the ghost while the water was\r\nhigh. A like fancy still lingers in some parts of Europe. On the\r\nCantabrian coast they think that persons who die of chronic or acute\r\ndisease expire at the moment when the tide begins to recede. In\r\nPortugal, all along the coast of Wales, and on some parts of the\r\ncoast of Brittany, a belief is said to prevail that people are born\r\nwhen the tide comes in, and die when it goes out. Dickens attests\r\nthe existence of the same superstition in England. "People can\'t\r\ndie, along the coast," said Mr. Pegotty, "except when the tide\'s\r\npretty nigh out. They can\'t be born, unless it\'s pretty nigh in--not\r\nproperly born till flood." The belief that most deaths happen at ebb\r\ntide is said to be held along the east coast of England from\r\nNorthumberland to Kent. Shakespeare must have been familiar with it,\r\nfor he makes Falstaff die "even just between twelve and one, e\'en at\r\nthe turning o\' the tide." We meet the belief again on the Pacific\r\ncoast of North America among the Haidas. Whenever a good Haida is\r\nabout to die he sees a canoe manned by some of his dead friends, who\r\ncome with the tide to bid him welcome to the spirit land. "Come with\r\nus now," they say, "for the tide is about to ebb and we must\r\ndepart." At Port Stephens, in New South Wales, the natives always\r\nburied their dead at flood tide, never at ebb, lest the retiring\r\nwater should bear the soul of the departed to some distant country.\r\n\r\nTo ensure a long life the Chinese have recourse to certain\r\ncomplicated charms, which concentrate in themselves the magical\r\nessence emanating, on homoeopathic principles, from times and\r\nseasons, from persons and from things. The vehicles employed to\r\ntransmit these happy influences are no other than grave-clothes.\r\nThese are provided by many Chinese in their lifetime, and most\r\npeople have them cut out and sewn by an unmarried girl or a very\r\nyoung woman, wisely calculating that, since such a person is likely\r\nto live a great many years to come, a part of her capacity to live\r\nlong must surely pass into the clothes, and thus stave off for many\r\nyears the time when they shall be put to their proper use. Further,\r\nthe garments are made by preference in a year which has an\r\nintercalary month; for to the Chinese mind it seems plain that\r\ngrave-clothes made in a year which is unusually long will possess\r\nthe capacity of prolonging life in an unusually high degree. Amongst\r\nthe clothes there is one robe in particular on which special pains\r\nhave been lavished to imbue it with this priceless quality. It is a\r\nlong silken gown of the deepest blue colour, with the word\r\n"longevity" embroidered all over it in thread of gold. To present an\r\naged parent with one of these costly and splendid mantles, known as\r\n"longevity garments," is esteemed by the Chinese an act of filial\r\npiety and a delicate mark of attention. As the garment purports to\r\nprolong the life of its owner, he often wears it, especially on\r\nfestive occasions, in order to allow the influence of longevity,\r\ncreated by the many golden letters with which it is bespangled, to\r\nwork their full effect upon his person. On his birthday, above all,\r\nhe hardly ever fails to don it, for in China common sense bids a man\r\nlay in a large stock of vital energy on his birthday, to be expended\r\nin the form of health and vigour during the rest of the year.\r\nAttired in the gorgeous pall, and absorbing its blessed influence at\r\nevery pore, the happy owner receives complacently the\r\ncongratulations of friends and relations, who warmly express their\r\nadmiration of these magnificent cerements, and of the filial piety\r\nwhich prompted the children to bestow so beautiful and useful a\r\npresent on the author of their being.\r\n\r\nAnother application of the maxim that like produces like is seen in\r\nthe Chinese belief that the fortunes of a town are deeply affected\r\nby its shape, and that they must vary according to the character of\r\nthe thing which that shape most nearly resembles. Thus it is related\r\nthat long ago the town of Tsuen-cheu-fu, the outlines of which are\r\nlike those of a carp, frequently fell a prey to the depredations of\r\nthe neighbouring city of Yung-chun, which is shaped like a\r\nfishing-net, until the inhabitants of the former town conceived the\r\nplan of erecting two tall pagodas in their midst. These pagodas,\r\nwhich still tower above the city of Tsuen-cheu-fu, have ever since\r\nexercised the happiest influence over its destiny by intercepting\r\nthe imaginary net before it could descend and entangle in its meshes\r\nthe imaginary carp. Some forty years ago the wise men of Shanghai\r\nwere much exercised to discover the cause of a local rebellion. On\r\ncareful enquiry they ascertained that the rebellion was due to the\r\nshape of a large new temple which had most unfortunately been built\r\nin the shape of a tortoise, an animal of the very worst character.\r\nThe difficulty was serious, the danger was pressing; for to pull\r\ndown the temple would have been impious, and to let it stand as it\r\nwas would be to court a succession of similar or worse disasters.\r\nHowever, the genius of the local professors of geomancy, rising to\r\nthe occasion, triumphantly surmounted the difficulty and obviated\r\nthe danger. By filling up two wells, which represented the eyes of\r\nthe tortoise, they at once blinded that disreputable animal and\r\nrendered him incapable of doing further mischief.\r\n\r\nSometimes homoeopathic or imitative magic is called in to annul an\r\nevil omen by accomplishing it in mimicry. The effect is to\r\ncircumvent destiny by substituting a mock calamity for a real one.\r\nIn Madagascar this mode of cheating the fates is reduced to a\r\nregular system. Here every man\'s fortune is determined by the day or\r\nhour of his birth, and if that happens to be an unlucky one his fate\r\nis sealed, unless the mischief can be extracted, as the phrase goes,\r\nby means of a substitute. The ways of extracting the mischief are\r\nvarious. For example, if a man is born on the first day of the\r\nsecond month (February), his house will be burnt down when he comes\r\nof age. To take time by the forelock and avoid this catastrophe, the\r\nfriends of the infant will set up a shed in a field or in the\r\ncattle-fold and burn it. If the ceremony is to be really effective,\r\nthe child and his mother should be placed in the shed and only\r\nplucked, like brands, from the burning hut before it is too late.\r\nAgain, dripping November is the month of tears, and he who is born\r\nin it is born to sorrow. But in order to disperse the clouds that\r\nthus gather over his future, he has nothing to do but to take the\r\nlid off a boiling pot and wave it about. The drops that fall from it\r\nwill accomplish his destiny and so prevent the tears from trickling\r\nfrom his eyes. Again, if fate has decreed that a young girl, still\r\nunwed, should see her children, still unborn, descend before her\r\nwith sorrow to the grave, she can avert the calamity as follows. She\r\nkills a grasshopper, wraps it in a rag to represent a shroud, and\r\nmourns over it like Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to\r\nbe comforted. Moreover, she takes a dozen or more other\r\ngrasshoppers, and having removed some of their superfluous legs and\r\nwings she lays them about their dead and shrouded fellow. The buzz\r\nof the tortured insects and the agitated motions of their mutilated\r\nlimbs represent the shrieks and contortions of the mourners at a\r\nfuneral. After burying the deceased grasshopper she leaves the rest\r\nto continue their mourning till death releases them from their pain;\r\nand having bound up her dishevelled hair she retires from the grave\r\nwith the step and carriage of a person plunged in grief. Thenceforth\r\nshe looks cheerfully forward to seeing her children survive her; for\r\nit cannot be that she should mourn and bury them twice over. Once\r\nmore, if fortune has frowned on a man at his birth and penury has\r\nmarked him for her own, he can easily erase the mark in question by\r\npurchasing a couple of cheap pearls, price three halfpence, and\r\nburying them. For who but the rich of this world can thus afford to\r\nfling pearls away?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Contagious Magic\r\n\r\nTHUS far we have been considering chiefly that branch of sympathetic\r\nmagic which may be called homoeopathic or imitative. Its leading\r\nprinciple, as we have seen, is that like produces like, or, in other\r\nwords, that an effect resembles its cause. The other great branch of\r\nsympathetic magic, which I have called Contagious Magic, proceeds\r\nupon the notion that things which have once been conjoined must\r\nremain ever afterwards, even when quite dissevered from each other,\r\nin such a sympathetic relation that whatever is done to the one must\r\nsimilarly affect the other. Thus the logical basis of Contagious\r\nMagic, like that of Homoeopathic Magic, is a mistaken association of\r\nideas; its physical basis, if we may speak of such a thing, like the\r\nphysical basis of Homoeopathic Magic, is a material medium of some\r\nsort which, like the ether of modern physics, is assumed to unite\r\ndistant objects and to convey impressions from one to the other. The\r\nmost familiar example of Contagious Magic is the magical sympathy\r\nwhich is supposed to exist between a man and any severed portion of\r\nhis person, as his hair or nails; so that whoever gets possession of\r\nhuman hair or nails may work his will, at any distance, upon the\r\nperson from whom they were cut. This superstition is world-wide;\r\ninstances of it in regard to hair and nails will be noticed later on\r\nin this work.\r\n\r\nAmong the Australian tribes it was a common practice to knock out\r\none or more of a boy\'s front teeth at those ceremonies of initiation\r\nto which every male member had to submit before he could enjoy the\r\nrights and privileges of a full-grown man. The reason of the\r\npractice is obscure; all that concerns us here is the belief that a\r\nsympathetic relation continued to exist between the lad and his\r\nteeth after the latter had been extracted from his gums. Thus among\r\nsome of the tribes about the river Darling, in New South Wales, the\r\nextracted tooth was placed under the bark of a tree near a river or\r\nwater-hole; if the bark grew over the tooth, or if the tooth fell\r\ninto the water, all was well; but if it were exposed and the ants\r\nran over it, the natives believed that the boy would suffer from a\r\ndisease of the mouth. Among the Murring and other tribes of New\r\nSouth Wales the extracted tooth was at first taken care of by an old\r\nman, and then passed from one headman to another, until it had gone\r\nall round the community, when it came back to the lad\'s father, and\r\nfinally to the lad himself. But however it was thus conveyed from\r\nhand to hand, it might on no account be placed in a bag containing\r\nmagical substances, for to do so would, they believed, put the owner\r\nof the tooth in great danger. The late Dr. Howitt once acted as\r\ncustodian of the teeth which had been extracted from some novices at\r\na ceremony of initiation, and the old men earnestly besought him not\r\nto carry them in a bag in which they knew that he had some quartz\r\ncrystals. They declared that if he did so the magic of the crystals\r\nwould pass into the teeth, and so injure the boys. Nearly a year\r\nafter Dr. Howitt\'s return from the ceremony he was visited by one of\r\nthe principal men of the Murring tribe, who had travelled some two\r\nhundred and fifty miles from his home to fetch back the teeth. This\r\nman explained that he had been sent for them because one of the boys\r\nhad fallen into ill health, and it was believed that the teeth had\r\nreceived some injury which had affected him. He was assured that the\r\nteeth had been kept in a box apart from any substances, like quartz\r\ncrystals, which could influence them; and he returned home bearing\r\nthe teeth with him carefully wrapt up and concealed.\r\n\r\nThe Basutos are careful to conceal their extracted teeth, lest these\r\nshould fall into the hands of certain mythical beings who haunt\r\ngraves, and who could harm the owner of the tooth by working magic\r\non it. In Sussex some fifty years ago a maid-servant remonstrated\r\nstrongly against the throwing away of children\'s cast teeth,\r\naffirming that should they be found and gnawed by any animal, the\r\nchild\'s new tooth would be, for all the world, like the teeth of the\r\nanimal that had bitten the old one. In proof of this she named old\r\nMaster Simmons, who had a very large pig\'s tooth in his upper jaw, a\r\npersonal defect that he always averred was caused by his mother, who\r\nthrew away one of his cast teeth by accident into the hog\'s trough.\r\nA similar belief has led to practices intended, on the principles of\r\nhomoeopathic magic, to replace old teeth by new and better ones.\r\nThus in many parts of the world it is customary to put extracted\r\nteeth in some place where they will be found by a mouse or a rat, in\r\nthe hope that, through the sympathy which continues to subsist\r\nbetween them and their former owner, his other teeth may acquire the\r\nsame firmness and excellence as the teeth of these rodents. For\r\nexample, in Germany it is said to be an almost universal maxim among\r\nthe people that when you have had a tooth taken out you should\r\ninsert it in a mouse\'s hole. To do so with a child\'s milk-tooth\r\nwhich has fallen out will prevent the child from having toothache.\r\nOr you should go behind the stove and throw your tooth backwards\r\nover your head, saying "Mouse, give me your iron tooth; I will give\r\nyou my bone tooth." After that your other teeth will remain good.\r\nFar away from Europe, at Raratonga, in the Pacific, when a child\'s\r\ntooth was extracted, the following prayer used to be recited:\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Big rat! little rat!\r\n     Here is my old tooth.\r\n     Pray give me a new one."\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the tooth was thrown on the thatch of the house, because rats\r\nmake their nests in the decayed thatch. The reason assigned for\r\ninvoking the rats on these occasions was that rats\' teeth were the\r\nstrongest known to the natives.\r\n\r\nOther parts which are commonly believed to remain in a sympathetic\r\nunion with the body, after the physical connexion has been severed,\r\nare the navel-string and the afterbirth, including the placenta. So\r\nintimate, indeed, is the union conceived to be, that the fortunes of\r\nthe individual for good or evil throughout life are often supposed\r\nto be bound up with one or other of these portions of his person, so\r\nthat if his navel-string or afterbirth is preserved and properly\r\ntreated, he will be prosperous; whereas if it be injured or lost, he\r\nwill suffer accordingly. Thus certain tribes of Western Australia\r\nbelieve that a man swims well or ill, according as his mother at his\r\nbirth threw the navel-string into water or not. Among the natives on\r\nthe Pennefather River in Queensland it is believed that a part of\r\nthe child\'s spirit (_cho-i_) stays in the afterbirth. Hence the\r\ngrandmother takes the afterbirth away and buries it in the sand. She\r\nmarks the spot by a number of twigs which she sticks in the ground\r\nin a circle, tying their tops together so that the structure\r\nresembles a cone. When Anjea, the being who causes conception in\r\nwomen by putting mud babies into their wombs, comes along and sees\r\nthe place, he takes out the spirit and carries it away to one of his\r\nhaunts, such as a tree, a hole in a rock, or a lagoon where it may\r\nremain for years. But sometime or other he will put the spirit again\r\ninto a baby, and it will be born once more into the world. In\r\nPonape, one of the Caroline Islands, the navel-string is placed in a\r\nshell and then disposed of in such a way as shall best adapt the\r\nchild for the career which the parents have chosen for him; for\r\nexample, if they wish to make him a good climber, they will hang the\r\nnavel-string on a tree. The Kei islanders regard the navel-string as\r\nthe brother or sister of the child, according to the sex of the\r\ninfant. They put it in a pot with ashes, and set it in the branches\r\nof a tree, that it may keep a watchful eye on the fortunes of its\r\ncomrade. Among the Bataks of Sumatra, as among many other peoples of\r\nthe Indian Archipelago, the placenta passes for the child\'s younger\r\nbrother or sister, the sex being determined by the sex of the child,\r\nand it is buried under the house. According to the Bataks it is\r\nbound up with the child\'s welfare, and seems, in fact, to be the\r\nseat of the transferable soul, of which we shall hear something\r\nlater on. The Karo Bataks even affirm that of a man\'s two souls it\r\nis the true soul that lives with the placenta under the house; that\r\nis the soul, they say, which begets children.\r\n\r\nThe Baganda believe that every person is born with a double, and\r\nthis double they identify with the afterbirth, which they regard as\r\na second child. The mother buries the afterbirth at the root of a\r\nplantain tree, which then becomes sacred until the fruit has\r\nripened, when it is plucked to furnish a sacred feast for the\r\nfamily. Among the Cherokees the navel-string of a girl is buried\r\nunder a corn-mortar, in order that the girl may grow up to be a good\r\nbaker; but the navel-string of a boy is hung up on a tree in the\r\nwoods, in order that he may be a hunter. The Incas of Peru preserved\r\nthe navel-string with the greatest care, and gave it to the child to\r\nsuck whenever it fell ill. In ancient Mexico they used to give a\r\nboy\'s navel-string to soldiers, to be buried by them on a field of\r\nbattle, in order that the boy might thus acquire a passion for war.\r\nBut the navel-string of a girl was buried beside the domestic\r\nhearth, because this was believed to inspire her with a love of home\r\nand taste for cooking and baking.\r\n\r\nEven in Europe many people still believe that a person\'s destiny is\r\nmore or less bound up with that of his navel-string or afterbirth.\r\nThus in Rhenish Bavaria the navel-string is kept for a while wrapt\r\nup in a piece of old linen, and then cut or pricked to pieces\r\naccording as the child is a boy or a girl, in order that he or she\r\nmay grow up to be a skilful workman or a good sempstress. In Berlin\r\nthe midwife commonly delivers the dried navel-string to the father\r\nwith a strict injunction to preserve it carefully, for so long as it\r\nis kept the child will live and thrive and be free from sickness. In\r\nBeauce and Perche the people are careful to throw the navel-string\r\nneither into water nor into fire, believing that if that were done\r\nthe child would be drowned or burned.\r\n\r\nThus in many parts of the world the navel-string, or more commonly\r\nthe afterbirth, is regarded as a living being, the brother or sister\r\nof the infant, or as the material object in which the guardian\r\nspirit of the child or part of its soul resides. Further, the\r\nsympathetic connexion supposed to exist between a person and his\r\nafterbirth or navel-string comes out very clearly in the widespread\r\ncustom of treating the afterbirth or navel-string in ways which are\r\nsupposed to influence for life the character and career of the\r\nperson, making him, if it is a man, a nimble climber, a strong\r\nswimmer, a skilful hunter, or a brave soldier, and making her, if it\r\nis a woman, a cunning sempstress, a good baker, and so forth. Thus\r\nthe beliefs and usages concerned with the afterbirth or placenta,\r\nand to a less extent with the navel-string, present a remarkable\r\nparallel to the widespread doctrine of the transferable or external\r\nsoul and the customs founded on it. Hence it is hardly rash to\r\nconjecture that the resemblance is no mere chance coincidence, but\r\nthat in the afterbirth or placenta we have a physical basis (not\r\nnecessarily the only one) for the theory and practice of the\r\nexternal soul. The consideration of that subject is reserved for a\r\nlater part of this work.\r\n\r\nA curious application of the doctrine of contagious magic is the\r\nrelation commonly believed to exist between a wounded man and the\r\nagent of the wound, so that whatever is subsequently done by or to\r\nthe agent must correspondingly affect the patient either for good or\r\nevil. Thus Pliny tells us that if you have wounded a man and are\r\nsorry for it, you have only to spit on the hand that gave the wound,\r\nand the pain of the sufferer will be instantly alleviated. In\r\nMelanesia, if a man\'s friends get possession of the arrow which\r\nwounded him, they keep it in a damp place or in cool leaves, for\r\nthen the inflammation will be trifling and will soon subside.\r\nMeantime the enemy who shot the arrow is hard at work to aggravate\r\nthe wound by all the means in his power. For this purpose he and his\r\nfriends drink hot and burning juices and chew irritating leaves, for\r\nthis will clearly inflame and irritate the wound. Further, they keep\r\nthe bow near the fire to make the wound which it has inflicted hot;\r\nand for the same reason they put the arrow-head, if it has been\r\nrecovered, into the fire. Moreover, they are careful to keep the\r\nbow-string taut and to twang it occasionally, for this will cause\r\nthe wounded man to suffer from tension of the nerves and spasms of\r\ntetanus. "It is constantly received and avouched," says Bacon, "that\r\nthe anointing of the weapon that maketh the wound will heal the\r\nwound itself. In this experiment, upon the relation of men of credit\r\n(though myself, as yet, am not fully inclined to believe it), you\r\nshall note the points following: first, the ointment wherewith this\r\nis done is made of divers ingredients, whereof the strangest and\r\nhardest to come by are the moss upon the skull of a dead man\r\nunburied, and the fats of a boar and a bear killed in the act of\r\ngeneration." The precious ointment compounded out of these and other\r\ningredients was applied, as the philosopher explains, not to the\r\nwound but to the weapon, and that even though the injured man was at\r\na great distance and knew nothing about it. The experiment, he tells\r\nus, had been tried of wiping the ointment off the weapon without the\r\nknowledge of the person hurt, with the result that he was presently\r\nin a great rage of pain until the weapon was anointed again.\r\nMoreover, "it is affirmed that if you cannot get the weapon, yet if\r\nyou put an instrument of iron or wood resembling the weapon into the\r\nwound, whereby it bleedeth, the anointing of that instrument will\r\nserve and work the effect." Remedies of the sort which Bacon deemed\r\nworthy of his attention are still in vogue in the eastern counties\r\nof England. Thus in Suffolk if a man cuts himself with a bill-hook\r\nor a scythe he always takes care to keep the weapon bright, and oils\r\nit to prevent the wound from festering. If he runs a thorn or, as he\r\ncalls it, a bush into his hand, he oils or greases the extracted\r\nthorn. A man came to a doctor with an inflamed hand, having run a\r\nthorn into it while he was hedging. On being told that the hand was\r\nfestering, he remarked, "That didn\'t ought to, for I greased the\r\nbush well after I pulled it out." If a horse wounds its foot by\r\ntreading on a nail, a Suffolk groom will invariably preserve the\r\nnail, clean it, and grease it every day, to prevent the foot from\r\nfestering. Similarly Cambridgeshire labourers think that if a horse\r\nhas run a nail into its foot, it is necessary to grease the nail\r\nwith lard or oil and put it away in some safe place, or the horse\r\nwill not recover. A few years ago a veterinary surgeon was sent for\r\nto attend a horse which had ripped its side open on the hinge of a\r\nfarm gatepost. On arriving at the farm he found that nothing had\r\nbeen done for the wounded horse, but that a man was busy trying to\r\npry the hinge out of the gatepost in order that it might be greased\r\nand put away, which, in the opinion of the Cambridge wiseacres,\r\nwould conduce to the recovery of the animal. Similarly Essex rustics\r\nopine that, if a man has been stabbed with a knife, it is essential\r\nto his recovery that the knife should be greased and laid across the\r\nbed on which the sufferer is lying. So in Bavaria you are directed\r\nto anoint a linen rag with grease and tie it on the edge of the axe\r\nthat cut you, taking care to keep the sharp edge upwards. As the\r\ngrease on the axe dries, your wound heals. Similarly in the Harz\r\nMountains they say that if you cut yourself, you ought to smear the\r\nknife or the scissors with fat and put the instrument away in a dry\r\nplace in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\r\nAs the knife dries, the wound heals. Other people, however, in\r\nGermany say that you should stick the knife in some damp place in\r\nthe ground, and that your hurt will heal as the knife rusts. Others\r\nagain, in Bavaria, recommend you to smear the axe or whatever it is\r\nwith blood and put it under the eaves.\r\n\r\nThe train of reasoning which thus commends itself to English and\r\nGerman rustics, in common with the savages of Melanesia and America,\r\nis carried a step further by the aborigines of Central Australia,\r\nwho conceive that under certain circumstances the near relations of\r\na wounded man must grease themselves, restrict their diet, and\r\nregulate their behaviour in other ways in order to ensure his\r\nrecovery. Thus when a lad has been circumcised and the wound is not\r\nyet healed, his mother may not eat opossum, or a certain kind of\r\nlizard, or carpet snake, or any kind of fat, for otherwise she would\r\nretard the healing of the boy\'s wound. Every day she greases her\r\ndigging-sticks and never lets them out of her sight; at night she\r\nsleeps with them close to her head. No one is allowed to touch them.\r\nEvery day also she rubs her body all over with grease, as in some\r\nway this is believed to help her son\'s recovery. Another refinement\r\nof the same principle is due to the ingenuity of the German peasant.\r\nIt is said that when one of his pigs or sheep breaks its leg, a\r\nfarmer of Rhenish Bavaria or Hesse will bind up the leg of a chair\r\nwith bandages and splints in due form. For some days thereafter no\r\none may sit on that chair, move it, or knock up against it; for to\r\ndo so would pain the injured pig or sheep and hinder the cure. In\r\nthis last case it is clear that we have passed wholly out of the\r\nregion of contagious magic and into the region of homoeopathic or\r\nimitative magic; the chair-leg, which is treated instead of the\r\nbeast\'s leg, in no sense belongs to the animal, and the application\r\nof bandages to it is a mere simulation of the treatment which a more\r\nrational surgery would bestow on the real patient.\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic connexion supposed to exist between a man and the\r\nweapon which has wounded him is probably founded on the notion that\r\nthe blood on the weapon continues to feel with the blood in his\r\nbody. For a like reason the Papuans of Tumleo, an island off New\r\nGuinea, are careful to throw into the sea the bloody bandages with\r\nwhich their wounds have been dressed, for they fear that if these\r\nrags fell into the hands of an enemy he might injure them magically\r\nthereby. Once when a man with a wound in his mouth, which bled\r\nconstantly, came to the missionaries to be treated, his faithful\r\nwife took great pains to collect all the blood and cast it into the\r\nsea. Strained and unnatural as this idea may seem to us, it is\r\nperhaps less so than the belief that magic sympathy is maintained\r\nbetween a person and his clothes, so that whatever is done to the\r\nclothes will be felt by the man himself, even though he may be far\r\naway at the time. In the Wotjobaluk tribe of Victoria a wizard would\r\nsometimes get hold of a man\'s opossum rug and roast it slowly in the\r\nfire, and as he did so the owner of the rug would fall sick. If the\r\nwizard consented to undo the charm, he would give the rug back to\r\nthe sick man\'s friends, bidding them put it in water, "so as to wash\r\nthe fire out." When that happened, the sufferer would feel a\r\nrefreshing coolness and probably recover. In Tanna, one of the New\r\nHebrides, a man who had a grudge at another and desired his death\r\nwould try to get possession of a cloth which had touched the sweat\r\nof his enemy\'s body. If he succeeded, he rubbed the cloth carefully\r\nover with the leaves and twigs of a certain tree, rolled and bound\r\ncloth, twigs, and leaves into a long sausage-shaped bundle, and\r\nburned it slowly in the fire. As the bundle was consumed, the victim\r\nfell ill, and when it was reduced to ashes, he died. In this last\r\nform of enchantment, however, the magical sympathy may be supposed\r\nto exist not so much between the man and the cloth as between the\r\nman and the sweat which issued from his body. But in other cases of\r\nthe same sort it seems that the garment by itself is enough to give\r\nthe sorcerer a hold upon his victim. The witch in Theocritus, while\r\nshe melted an image or lump of wax in order that her faithless lover\r\nmight melt with love of her, did not forget to throw into the fire a\r\nshred of his cloak which he had dropped in her house. In Prussia\r\nthey say that if you cannot catch a thief, the next best thing you\r\ncan do is to get hold of a garment which he may have shed in his\r\nflight; for if you beat it soundly, the thief will fall sick. This\r\nbelief is firmly rooted in the popular mind. Some eighty or ninety\r\nyears ago, in the neighbourhood of Berend, a man was detected trying\r\nto steal honey, and fled, leaving his coat behind him. When he heard\r\nthat the enraged owner of the honey was mauling his lost coat, he\r\nwas so alarmed that he took to his bed and died.\r\n\r\nAgain, magic may be wrought on a man sympathetically, not only\r\nthrough his clothes and severed parts of himself, but also through\r\nthe impressions left by his body in sand or earth. In particular, it\r\nis a world-wide superstition that by injuring footprints you injure\r\nthe feet that made them. Thus the natives of South-eastern Australia\r\nthink that they can lame a man by placing sharp pieces of quartz,\r\nglass, bone, or charcoal in his footprints. Rheumatic pains are\r\noften attributed by them to this cause. Seeing a Tatungolung man\r\nvery lame, Mr. Howitt asked him what was the matter. He said, "some\r\nfellow has put _bottle_ in my foot." He was suffering from\r\nrheumatism, but believed that an enemy had found his foot-track and\r\nhad buried it in a piece of broken bottle, the magical influence of\r\nwhich had entered his foot.\r\n\r\nSimilar practices prevail in various parts of Europe. Thus in\r\nMecklenburg it is thought that if you drive a nail into a man\'s\r\nfootprint he will fall lame; sometimes it is required that the nail\r\nshould be taken from a coffin. A like mode of injuring an enemy is\r\nresorted to in some parts of France. It is said that there was an\r\nold woman who used to frequent Stow in Suffolk, and she was a witch.\r\nIf, while she walked, any one went after her and stuck a nail or a\r\nknife into her footprint in the dust, the dame could not stir a step\r\ntill it was withdrawn. Among the South Slavs a girl will dig up the\r\nearth from the footprints of the man she loves and put it in a\r\nflower-pot. Then she plants in the pot a marigold, a flower that is\r\nthought to be fadeless. And as its golden blossom grows and blooms\r\nand never fades, so shall her sweetheart\'s love grow and bloom, and\r\nnever, never fade. Thus the love-spell acts on the man through the\r\nearth he trod on. An old Danish mode of concluding a treaty was\r\nbased on the same idea of the sympathetic connexion between a man\r\nand his footprints: the covenanting parties sprinkled each other\'s\r\nfootprints with their own blood, thus giving a pledge of fidelity.\r\nIn ancient Greece superstitions of the same sort seem to have been\r\ncurrent, for it was thought that if a horse stepped on the track of\r\na wolf he was seized with numbness; and a maxim ascribed to\r\nPythagoras forbade people to pierce a man\'s footprints with a nail\r\nor a knife.\r\n\r\nThe same superstition is turned to account by hunters in many parts\r\nof the world for the purpose of running down the game. Thus a German\r\nhuntsman will stick a nail taken from a coffin into the fresh spoor\r\nof the quarry, believing that this will hinder the animal from\r\nescaping. The aborigines of Victoria put hot embers in the tracks of\r\nthe animals they were pursuing. Hottentot hunters throw into the air\r\na handful of sand taken from the footprints of the game, believing\r\nthat this will bring the animal down. Thompson Indians used to lay\r\ncharms on the tracks of wounded deer; after that they deemed it\r\nsuperfluous to pursue the animal any further that day, for being\r\nthus charmed it could not travel far and would soon die. Similarly,\r\nOjebway Indians placed "medicine" on the track of the first deer or\r\nbear they met with, supposing that this would soon bring the animal\r\ninto sight, even if it were two or three days\' journey off; for this\r\ncharm had power to compress a journey of several days into a few\r\nhours. Ewe hunters of West Africa stab the footprints of game with a\r\nsharp-pointed stick in order to maim the quarry and allow them to\r\ncome up with it.\r\n\r\nBut though the footprint is the most obvious it is not the only\r\nimpression made by the body through which magic may be wrought on a\r\nman. The aborigines of South-eastern Australia believe that a man\r\nmay be injured by burying sharp fragments of quartz, glass, and so\r\nforth in the mark made by his reclining body; the magical virtue of\r\nthese sharp things enters his body and causes those acute pains\r\nwhich the ignorant European puts down to rheumatism. We can now\r\nunderstand why it was a maxim with the Pythagoreans that in rising\r\nfrom bed you should smooth away the impression left by your body on\r\nthe bed-clothes. The rule was simply an old precaution against\r\nmagic, forming part of a whole code of superstitious maxims which\r\nantiquity fathered on Pythagoras, though doubtless they were\r\nfamiliar to the barbarous forefathers of the Greeks long before the\r\ntime of that philosopher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The Magician\'s Progress\r\n\r\nWE have now concluded our examination of the general principles of\r\nsympathetic magic. The examples by which I have illustrated them\r\nhave been drawn for the most part from what may be called private\r\nmagic, that is from magical rites and incantations practised for the\r\nbenefit or the injury of individuals. But in savage society there is\r\ncommonly to be found in addition what we may call public magic, that\r\nis, sorcery practised for the benefit of the whole community.\r\nWherever ceremonies of this sort are observed for the common good,\r\nit is obvious that the magician ceases to be merely a private\r\npractitioner and becomes to some extent a public functionary. The\r\ndevelopment of such a class of functionaries is of great importance\r\nfor the political as well as the religious evolution of society. For\r\nwhen the welfare of the tribe is supposed to depend on the\r\nperformance of these magical rites, the magician rises into a\r\nposition of much influence and repute, and may readily acquire the\r\nrank and authority of a chief or king. The profession accordingly\r\ndraws into its ranks some of the ablest and most ambitious men of\r\nthe tribe, because it holds out to them a prospect of honour,\r\nwealth, and power such as hardly any other career could offer. The\r\nacuter minds perceive how easy it is to dupe their weaker brother\r\nand to play on his superstition for their own advantage. Not that\r\nthe sorcerer is always a knave and impostor; he is often sincerely\r\nconvinced that he really possesses those wonderful powers which the\r\ncredulity of his fellows ascribes to him. But the more sagacious he\r\nis, the more likely he is to see through the fallacies which impose\r\non duller wits. Thus the ablest members of the profession must tend\r\nto be more or less conscious deceivers; and it is just these men who\r\nin virtue of their superior ability will generally come to the top\r\nand win for themselves positions of the highest dignity and the most\r\ncommanding authority. The pitfalls which beset the path of the\r\nprofessional sorcerer are many, and as a rule only the man of\r\ncoolest head and sharpest wit will be able to steer his way through\r\nthem safely. For it must always be remembered that every single\r\nprofession and claim put forward by the magician as such is false;\r\nnot one of them can be maintained without deception, conscious or\r\nunconscious. Accordingly the sorcerer who sincerely believes in his\r\nown extravagant pretensions is in far greater peril and is much more\r\nlikely to be cut short in his career than the deliberate impostor.\r\nThe honest wizard always expects that his charms and incantations\r\nwill produce their supposed effect; and when they fail, not only\r\nreally, as they always do, but conspicuously and disastrously, as\r\nthey often do, he is taken aback: he is not, like his knavish\r\ncolleague, ready with a plausible excuse to account for the failure,\r\nand before he can find one he may be knocked on the head by his\r\ndisappointed and angry employers.\r\n\r\nThe general result is that at this stage of social evolution the\r\nsupreme power tends to fall into the hands of men of the keenest\r\nintelligence and the most unscrupulous character. If we could\r\nbalance the harm they do by their knavery against the benefits they\r\nconfer by their superior sagacity, it might well be found that the\r\ngood greatly outweighed the evil. For more mischief has probably\r\nbeen wrought in the world by honest fools in high places than by\r\nintelligent rascals. Once your shrewd rogue has attained the height\r\nof his ambition, and has no longer any selfish end to further, he\r\nmay, and often does, turn his talents, his experience, his\r\nresources, to the service of the public. Many men who have been\r\nleast scrupulous in the acquisition of power have been most\r\nbeneficent in the use of it, whether the power they aimed at and won\r\nwas that of wealth, political authority, or what not. In the field\r\nof politics the wily intriguer, the ruthless victor, may end by\r\nbeing a wise and magnanimous ruler, blessed in his lifetime,\r\nlamented at his death, admired and applauded by posterity. Such men,\r\nto take two of the most conspicuous instances, were Julius Caesar\r\nand Augustus. But once a fool always a fool, and the greater the\r\npower in his hands the more disastrous is likely to be the use he\r\nmakes of it. The heaviest calamity in English history, the breach\r\nwith America, might never have occurred if George the Third had not\r\nbeen an honest dullard.\r\n\r\nThus, so far as the public profession of magic affected the\r\nconstitution of savage society, it tended to place the control of\r\naffairs in the hands of the ablest man: it shifted the balance of\r\npower from the many to the one: it substituted a monarchy for a\r\ndemocracy, or rather for an oligarchy of old men; for in general the\r\nsavage community is ruled, not by the whole body of adult males, but\r\nby a council of elders. The change, by whatever causes produced, and\r\nwhatever the character of the early rulers, was on the whole very\r\nbeneficial. For the rise of monarchy appears to be an essential\r\ncondition of the emergence of mankind from savagery. No human being\r\nis so hide-bound by custom and tradition as your democratic savage;\r\nin no state of society consequently is progress so slow and\r\ndifficult. The old notion that the savage is the freest of mankind\r\nis the reverse of the truth. He is a slave, not indeed to a visible\r\nmaster, but to the past, to the spirits of his dead forefathers, who\r\nhaunt his steps from birth to death, and rule him with a rod of\r\niron. What they did is the pattern of right, the unwritten law to\r\nwhich he yields a blind unquestioning obedience. The least possible\r\nscope is thus afforded to superior talent to change old customs for\r\nthe better. The ablest man is dragged down by the weakest and\r\ndullest, who necessarily sets the standard, since he cannot rise,\r\nwhile the other can fall. The surface of such a society presents a\r\nuniform dead level, so far as it is humanly possible to reduce the\r\nnatural inequalities, the immeasurable real differences of inborn\r\ncapacity and temper, to a false superficial appearance of equality.\r\nFrom this low and stagnant condition of affairs, which demagogues\r\nand dreamers in later times have lauded as the ideal state, the\r\nGolden Age, of humanity, everything that helps to raise society by\r\nopening a career to talent and proportioning the degrees of\r\nauthority to men\'s natural abilities, deserves to be welcomed by all\r\nwho have the real good of their fellows at heart. Once these\r\nelevating influences have begun to operate--and they cannot be for\r\never suppressed--the progress of civilisation becomes comparatively\r\nrapid. The rise of one man to supreme power enables him to carry\r\nthrough changes in a single lifetime which previously many\r\ngenerations might not have sufficed to effect; and if, as will often\r\nhappen, he is a man of intellect and energy above the common, he\r\nwill readily avail himself of the opportunity. Even the whims and\r\ncaprices of a tyrant may be of service in breaking the chain of\r\ncustom which lies so heavy on the savage. And as soon as the tribe\r\nceases to be swayed by the timid and divided counsels of the elders,\r\nand yields to the direction of a single strong and resolute mind, it\r\nbecomes formidable to its neighbours and enters on a career of\r\naggrandisement, which at an early stage of history is often highly\r\nfavourable to social, industrial, and intellectual progress. For\r\nextending its sway, partly by force of arms, partly by the voluntary\r\nsubmission of weaker tribes, the community soon acquires wealth and\r\nslaves, both of which, by relieving some classes from the perpetual\r\nstruggle for a bare subsistence, afford them an opportunity of\r\ndevoting themselves to that disinterested pursuit of knowledge which\r\nis the noblest and most powerful instrument to ameliorate the lot of\r\nman.\r\n\r\nIntellectual progress, which reveals itself in the growth of art and\r\nscience and the spread of more liberal views, cannot be dissociated\r\nfrom industrial or economic progress, and that in its turn receives\r\nan immense impulse from conquest and empire. It is no mere accident\r\nthat the most vehement outbursts of activity of the human mind have\r\nfollowed close on the heels of victory, and that the great\r\nconquering races of the world have commonly done most to advance and\r\nspread civilisation, thus healing in peace the wounds they inflicted\r\nin war. The Babylonians, the Greeks, the Romans, the Arabs are our\r\nwitnesses in the past: we may yet live to see a similar outburst in\r\nJapan. Nor, to remount the stream of history to its sources, is it\r\nan accident that all the first great strides towards civilisation\r\nhave been made under despotic and theocratic governments, like those\r\nof Egypt, Babylon, and Peru, where the supreme ruler claimed and\r\nreceived the servile allegiance of his subjects in the double\r\ncharacter of a king and a god. It is hardly too much to say that at\r\nthis early epoch despotism is the best friend of humanity and,\r\nparadoxical as it may sound, of liberty. For after all there is more\r\nliberty in the best sense--liberty to think our own thoughts and to\r\nfashion our own destinies--under the most absolute despotism, the\r\nmost grinding tyranny, than under the apparent freedom of savage\r\nlife, where the individual\'s lot is cast from the cradle to the\r\ngrave in the iron mould of hereditary custom.\r\n\r\nSo far, therefore, as the public profession of magic has been one of\r\nthe roads by which the ablest men have passed to supreme power, it\r\nhas contributed to emancipate mankind from the thraldom of tradition\r\nand to elevate them into a larger, freer life, with a broader\r\noutlook on the world. This is no small service rendered to humanity.\r\nAnd when we remember further that in another direction magic has\r\npaved the way for science, we are forced to admit that if the black\r\nart has done much evil, it has also been the source of much good;\r\nthat if it is the child of error, it has yet been the mother of\r\nfreedom and truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Magic and Religion\r\n\r\nTHE examples collected in the last chapter may suffice to illustrate\r\nthe general principles of sympathetic magic in its two branches, to\r\nwhich we have given the names of Homoeopathic and Contagious\r\nrespectively. In some cases of magic which have come before us we\r\nhave seen that the operation of spirits is assumed, and that an\r\nattempt is made to win their favour by prayer and sacrifice. But\r\nthese cases are on the whole exceptional; they exhibit magic tinged\r\nand alloyed with religion. Wherever sympathetic magic occurs in its\r\npure unadulterated form, it assumes that in nature one event follows\r\nanother necessarily and invariably without the intervention of any\r\nspiritual or personal agency. Thus its fundamental conception is\r\nidentical with that of modern science; underlying the whole system\r\nis a faith, implicit but real and firm, in the order and uniformity\r\nof nature. The magician does not doubt that the same causes will\r\nalways produce the same effects, that the performance of the proper\r\nceremony, accompanied by the appropriate spell, will inevitably be\r\nattended by the desired result, unless, indeed, his incantations\r\nshould chance to be thwarted and foiled by the more potent charms of\r\nanother sorcerer. He supplicates no higher power: he sues the favour\r\nof no fickle and wayward being: he abases himself before no awful\r\ndeity. Yet his power, great as he believes it to be, is by no means\r\narbitrary and unlimited. He can wield it only so long as he strictly\r\nconforms to the rules of his art, or to what may be called the laws\r\nof nature as conceived by him. To neglect these rules, to break\r\nthese laws in the smallest particular, is to incur failure, and may\r\neven expose the unskilful practitioner himself to the utmost peril.\r\nIf he claims a sovereignty over nature, it is a constitutional\r\nsovereignty rigorously limited in its scope and exercised in exact\r\nconformity with ancient usage. Thus the analogy between the magical\r\nand the scientific conceptions of the world is close. In both of\r\nthem the succession of events is assumed to be perfectly regular and\r\ncertain, being determined by immutable laws, the operation of which\r\ncan be foreseen and calculated precisely; the elements of caprice,\r\nof chance, and of accident are banished from the course of nature.\r\nBoth of them open up a seemingly boundless vista of possibilities to\r\nhim who knows the causes of things and can touch the secret springs\r\nthat set in motion the vast and intricate mechanism of the world.\r\nHence the strong attraction which magic and science alike have\r\nexercised on the human mind; hence the powerful stimulus that both\r\nhave given to the pursuit of knowledge. They lure the weary\r\nenquirer, the footsore seeker, on through the wilderness of\r\ndisappointment in the present by their endless promises of the\r\nfuture: they take him up to the top of an exceeding high mountain\r\nand show him, beyond the dark clouds and rolling mists at his feet,\r\na vision of the celestial city, far off, it may be, but radiant with\r\nunearthly splendour, bathed in the light of dreams.\r\n\r\nThe fatal flaw of magic lies not in its general assumption of a\r\nsequence of events determined by law, but in its total misconception\r\nof the nature of the particular laws which govern that sequence. If\r\nwe analyse the various cases of sympathetic magic which have been\r\npassed in review in the preceding pages, and which may be taken as\r\nfair samples of the bulk, we shall find, as I have already\r\nindicated, that they are all mistaken applications of one or other\r\nof two great fundamental laws of thought, namely, the association of\r\nideas by similarity and the association of ideas by contiguity in\r\nspace or time. A mistaken association of similar ideas produces\r\nhomoeopathic or imitative magic: a mistaken association of\r\ncontiguous ideas produces contagious magic. The principles of\r\nassociation are excellent in themselves, and indeed absolutely\r\nessential to the working of the human mind. Legitimately applied\r\nthey yield science; illegitimately applied they yield magic, the\r\nbastard sister of science. It is therefore a truism, almost a\r\ntautology, to say that all magic is necessarily false and barren;\r\nfor were it ever to become true and fruitful, it would no longer be\r\nmagic but science. From the earliest times man has been engaged in a\r\nsearch for general rules whereby to turn the order of natural\r\nphenomena to his own advantage, and in the long search he has\r\nscraped together a great hoard of such maxims, some of them golden\r\nand some of them mere dross. The true or golden rules constitute the\r\nbody of applied science which we call the arts; the false are magic.\r\n\r\nIf magic is thus next of kin to science, we have still to enquire\r\nhow it stands related to religion. But the view we take of that\r\nrelation will necessarily be coloured by the idea which we have\r\nformed of the nature of religion itself; hence a writer may\r\nreasonably be expected to define his conception of religion before\r\nhe proceeds to investigate its relation to magic. There is probably\r\nno subject in the world about which opinions differ so much as the\r\nnature of religion, and to frame a definition of it which would\r\nsatisfy every one must obviously be impossible. All that a writer\r\ncan do is, first, to say clearly what he means by religion, and\r\nafterwards to employ the word consistently in that sense throughout\r\nhis work. By religion, then, I understand a propitiation or\r\nconciliation of powers superior to man which are believed to direct\r\nand control the course of nature and of human life. Thus defined,\r\nreligion consists of two elements, a theoretical and a practical,\r\nnamely, a belief in powers higher than man and an attempt to\r\npropitiate or please them. Of the two, belief clearly comes first,\r\nsince we must believe in the existence of a divine being before we\r\ncan attempt to please him. But unless the belief leads to a\r\ncorresponding practice, it is not a religion but merely a theology;\r\nin the language of St. James, "faith, if it hath not works, is dead,\r\nbeing alone." In other words, no man is religious who does not\r\ngovern his conduct in some measure by the fear or love of God. On\r\nthe other hand, mere practice, divested of all religious belief, is\r\nalso not religion. Two men may behave in exactly the same way, and\r\nyet one of them may be religious and the other not. If the one acts\r\nfrom the love or fear of God, he is religious; if the other acts\r\nfrom the love or fear of man, he is moral or immoral according as\r\nhis behaviour comports or conflicts with the general good. Hence\r\nbelief and practice or, in theological language, faith and works are\r\nequally essential to religion, which cannot exist without both of\r\nthem. But it is not necessary that religious practice should always\r\ntake the form of a ritual; that is, it need not consist in the\r\noffering of sacrifice, the recitation of prayers, and other outward\r\nceremonies. Its aim is to please the deity, and if the deity is one\r\nwho delights in charity and mercy and purity more than in oblations\r\nof blood, the chanting of hymns, and the fumes of incense, his\r\nworshippers will best please him, not by prostrating themselves\r\nbefore him, by intoning his praises, and by filling his temples with\r\ncostly gifts, but by being pure and merciful and charitable towards\r\nmen, for in so doing they will imitate, so far as human infirmity\r\nallows, the perfections of the divine nature. It was this ethical\r\nside of religion which the Hebrew prophets, inspired with a noble\r\nideal of God\'s goodness and holiness, were never weary of\r\ninculcating. Thus Micah says: "He hath shewed thee, O man, what is\r\ngood; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and\r\nto love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" And at a later time\r\nmuch of the force by which Christianity conquered the world was\r\ndrawn from the same high conception of God\'s moral nature and the\r\nduty laid on men of conforming themselves to it. "Pure religion and\r\nundefiled," says St. James, "before God and the Father is this, To\r\nvisit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep\r\nhimself unspotted from the world."\r\n\r\nBut if religion involves, first, a belief in superhuman beings who\r\nrule the world, and, second, an attempt to win their favour, it\r\nclearly assumes that the course of nature is to some extent elastic\r\nor variable, and that we can persuade or induce the mighty beings\r\nwho control it to deflect, for our benefit, the current of events\r\nfrom the channel in which they would otherwise flow. Now this\r\nimplied elasticity or variability of nature is directly opposed to\r\nthe principles of magic as well as of science, both of which assume\r\nthat the processes of nature are rigid and invariable in their\r\noperation, and that they can as little be turned from their course\r\nby persuasion and entreaty as by threats and intimidation. The\r\ndistinction between the two conflicting views of the universe turns\r\non their answer to the crucial question, Are the forces which govern\r\nthe world conscious and personal, or unconscious and impersonal?\r\nReligion, as a conciliation of the superhuman powers, assumes the\r\nformer member of the alternative. For all conciliation implies that\r\nthe being conciliated is a conscious or personal agent, that his\r\nconduct is in some measure uncertain, and that he can be prevailed\r\nupon to vary it in the desired direction by a judicious appeal to\r\nhis interests, his appetites, or his emotions. Conciliation is never\r\nemployed towards things which are regarded as inanimate, nor towards\r\npersons whose behaviour in the particular circumstances is known to\r\nbe determined with absolute certainty. Thus in so far as religion\r\nassumes the world to be directed by conscious agents who may be\r\nturned from their purpose by persuasion, it stands in fundamental\r\nantagonism to magic as well as to science, both of which take for\r\ngranted that the course of nature is determined, not by the passions\r\nor caprice of personal beings, but by the operation of immutable\r\nlaws acting mechanically. In magic, indeed, the assumption is only\r\nimplicit, but in science it is explicit. It is true that magic often\r\ndeals with spirits, which are personal agents of the kind assumed by\r\nreligion; but whenever it does so in its proper form, it treats them\r\nexactly in the same fashion as it treats inanimate agents, that is,\r\nit constrains or coerces instead of conciliating or propitiating\r\nthem as religion would do. Thus it assumes that all personal beings,\r\nwhether human or divine, are in the last resort subject to those\r\nimpersonal forces which control all things, but which nevertheless\r\ncan be turned to account by any one who knows how to manipulate them\r\nby the appropriate ceremonies and spells. In ancient Egypt, for\r\nexample, the magicians claimed the power of compelling even the\r\nhighest gods to do their bidding, and actually threatened them with\r\ndestruction in case of disobedience. Sometimes, without going quite\r\nso far as that, the wizard declared that he would scatter the bones\r\nof Osiris or reveal his sacred legend, if the god proved\r\ncontumacious. Similarly in India at the present day the great Hindoo\r\ntrinity itself of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva is subject to the\r\nsorcerers, who, by means of their spells, exercise such an\r\nascendency over the mightiest deities, that these are bound\r\nsubmissively to execute on earth below, or in heaven above, whatever\r\ncommands their masters the magicians may please to issue. There is a\r\nsaying everywhere current in India: "The whole universe is subject\r\nto the gods; the gods are subject to the spells (_mantras_); the\r\nspells to the Brahmans; therefore the Brahmans are our gods."\r\n\r\nThis radical conflict of principle between magic and religion\r\nsufficiently explains the relentless hostility with which in history\r\nthe priest has often pursued the magician. The haughty\r\nself-sufficiency of the magician, his arrogant demeanour towards the\r\nhigher powers, and his unabashed claim to exercise a sway like\r\ntheirs could not but revolt the priest, to whom, with his awful\r\nsense of the divine majesty, and his humble prostration in presence\r\nof it, such claims and such a demeanour must have appeared an\r\nimpious and blasphemous usurpation of prerogatives that belong to\r\nGod alone. And sometimes, we may suspect, lower motives concurred to\r\nwhet the edge of the priest\'s hostility. He professed to be the\r\nproper medium, the true intercessor between God and man, and no\r\ndoubt his interests as well as his feelings were often injured by a\r\nrival practitioner, who preached a surer and smoother road to\r\nfortune than the rugged and slippery path of divine favour.\r\n\r\nYet this antagonism, familiar as it is to us, seems to have made its\r\nappearance comparatively late in the history of religion. At an\r\nearlier stage the functions of priest and sorcerer were often\r\ncombined or, to speak perhaps more correctly, were not yet\r\ndifferentiated from each other. To serve his purpose man wooed the\r\ngood-will of gods or spirits by prayer and sacrifice, while at the\r\nsame time he had recourse to ceremonies and forms of words which he\r\nhoped would of themselves bring about the desired result without the\r\nhelp of god or devil. In short, he performed religious and magical\r\nrites simultaneously; he uttered prayers and incantations almost in\r\nthe same breath, knowing or recking little of the theoretical\r\ninconsistency of his behaviour, so long as by hook or crook he\r\ncontrived to get what he wanted. Instances of this fusion or\r\nconfusion of magic with religion have already met us in the\r\npractices of Melanesians and of other peoples.\r\n\r\nThe same confusion of magic and religion has survived among peoples\r\nthat have risen to higher levels of culture. It was rife in ancient\r\nIndia and ancient Egypt; it is by no means extinct among European\r\npeasantry at the present day. With regard to ancient India we are\r\ntold by an eminent Sanscrit scholar that "the sacrificial ritual at\r\nthe earliest period of which we have detailed information is\r\npervaded with practices that breathe the spirit of the most\r\nprimitive magic." Speaking of the importance of magic in the East,\r\nand especially in Egypt, Professor Maspero remarks that "we ought\r\nnot to attach to the word magic the degrading idea which it almost\r\ninevitably calls up in the mind of a modern. Ancient magic was the\r\nvery foundation of religion. The faithful who desired to obtain some\r\nfavour from a god had no chance of succeeding except by laying hands\r\non the deity, and this arrest could only be effected by means of a\r\ncertain number of rites, sacrifices, prayers, and chants, which the\r\ngod himself had revealed, and which obliged him to do what was\r\ndemanded of him."\r\n\r\nAmong the ignorant classes of modern Europe the same confusion of\r\nideas, the same mixture of religion and magic, crops up in various\r\nforms. Thus we are told that in France "the majority of the peasants\r\nstill believe that the priest possesses a secret and irresistible\r\npower over the elements. By reciting certain prayers which he alone\r\nknows and has the right to utter, yet for the utterance of which he\r\nmust afterwards demand absolution, he can, on an occasion of\r\npressing danger, arrest or reverse for a moment the action of the\r\neternal laws of the physical world. The winds, the storms, the hail,\r\nand the rain are at his command and obey his will. The fire also is\r\nsubject to him, and the flames of a conflagration are extinguished\r\nat his word." For example, French peasants used to be, perhaps are\r\nstill, persuaded that the priests could celebrate, with certain\r\nspecial rites, a Mass of the Holy Spirit, of which the efficacy was\r\nso miraculous that it never met with any opposition from the divine\r\nwill; God was forced to grant whatever was asked of Him in this\r\nform, however rash and importunate might be the petition. No idea of\r\nimpiety or irreverence attached to the rite in the minds of those\r\nwho, in some of the great extremities of life, sought by this\r\nsingular means to take the kingdom of heaven by storm. The secular\r\npriests generally refused to say the Mass of the Holy Spirit; but\r\nthe monks, especially the Capuchin friars, had the reputation of\r\nyielding with less scruple to the entreaties of the anxious and\r\ndistressed. In the constraint thus supposed by Catholic peasantry to\r\nbe laid by the priest upon the deity we seem to have an exact\r\ncounterpart of the power which the ancient Egyptians ascribed to\r\ntheir magicians. Again, to take another example, in many villages of\r\nProvence the priest is still reputed to possess the faculty of\r\naverting storms. It is not every priest who enjoys this reputation;\r\nand in some villages, when a change of pastors takes place, the\r\nparishioners are eager to learn whether the new incumbent has the\r\npower (_pouder_), as they call it. At the first sign of a heavy\r\nstorm they put him to the proof by inviting him to exorcise the\r\nthreatening clouds; and if the result answers to their hopes, the\r\nnew shepherd is assured of the sympathy and respect of his flock. In\r\nsome parishes, where the reputation of the curate in this respect\r\nstood higher than that of his rector, the relations between the two\r\nhave been so strained in consequence that the bishop has had to\r\ntranslate the rector to another benefice. Again, Gascon peasants\r\nbelieve that to revenge themselves on their enemies bad men will\r\nsometimes induce a priest to say a mass called the Mass of Saint\r\nS\xe9caire. Very few priests know this mass, and three-fourths of those\r\nwho do know it would not say it for love or money. None but wicked\r\npriests dare to perform the gruesome ceremony, and you may be quite\r\nsure that they will have a very heavy account to render for it at\r\nthe last day. No curate or bishop, not even the archbishop of Auch,\r\ncan pardon them; that right belongs to the pope of Rome alone. The\r\nMass of Saint S\xe9caire may be said only in a ruined or deserted\r\nchurch, where owls mope and hoot, where bats flit in the gloaming,\r\nwhere gypsies lodge of nights, and where toads squat under the\r\ndesecrated altar. Thither the bad priest comes by night with his\r\nlight o\' love, and at the first stroke of eleven he begins to mumble\r\nthe mass backwards, and ends just as the clocks are knelling the\r\nmidnight hour. His leman acts as clerk. The host he blesses is black\r\nand has three points; he consecrates no wine, but instead he drinks\r\nthe water of a well into which the body of an unbaptized infant has\r\nbeen flung. He makes the sign of the cross, but it is on the ground\r\nand with his left foot. And many other things he does which no good\r\nChristian could look upon without being struck blind and deaf and\r\ndumb for the rest of his life. But the man for whom the mass is said\r\nwithers away little by little, and nobody can say what is the matter\r\nwith him; even the doctors can make nothing of it. They do not know\r\nthat he is slowly dying of the Mass of Saint S\xe9caire.\r\n\r\nYet though magic is thus found to fuse and amalgamate with religion\r\nin many ages and in many lands, there are some grounds for thinking\r\nthat this fusion is not primitive, and that there was a time when\r\nman trusted to magic alone for the satisfaction of such wants as\r\ntranscended his immediate animal cravings. In the first place a\r\nconsideration of the fundamental notions of magic and religion may\r\nincline us to surmise that magic is older than religion in the\r\nhistory of humanity. We have seen that on the one hand magic is\r\nnothing but a mistaken application of the very simplest and most\r\nelementary processes of the mind, namely the association of ideas by\r\nvirtue of resemblance or contiguity; and that on the other hand\r\nreligion assumes the operation of conscious or personal agents,\r\nsuperior to man, behind the visible screen of nature. Obviously the\r\nconception of personal agents is more complex than a simple\r\nrecognition of the similarity or contiguity of ideas; and a theory\r\nwhich assumes that the course of nature is determined by conscious\r\nagents is more abstruse and recondite, and requires for its\r\napprehension a far higher degree of intelligence and reflection,\r\nthan the view that things succeed each other simply by reason of\r\ntheir contiguity or resemblance. The very beasts associate the ideas\r\nof things that are like each other or that have been found together\r\nin their experience; and they could hardly survive for a day if they\r\nceased to do so. But who attributes to the animals a belief that the\r\nphenomena of nature are worked by a multitude of invisible animals\r\nor by one enormous and prodigiously strong animal behind the scenes?\r\nIt is probably no injustice to the brutes to assume that the honour\r\nof devising a theory of this latter sort must be reserved for human\r\nreason. Thus, if magic be deduced immediately from elementary\r\nprocesses of reasoning, and be, in fact, an error into which the\r\nmind falls almost spontaneously, while religion rests on conceptions\r\nwhich the merely animal intelligence can hardly be supposed to have\r\nyet attained to, it becomes probable that magic arose before\r\nreligion in the evolution of our race, and that man essayed to bend\r\nnature to his wishes by the sheer force of spells and enchantments\r\nbefore he strove to coax and mollify a coy, capricious, or irascible\r\ndeity by the soft insinuation of prayer and sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion which we have thus reached deductively from a\r\nconsideration of the fundamental ideas of magic and religion is\r\nconfirmed inductively by the observation that among the aborigines\r\nof Australia, the rudest savages as to whom we possess accurate\r\ninformation, magic is universally practised, whereas religion in the\r\nsense of a propitiation or conciliation of the higher powers seems\r\nto be nearly unknown. Roughly speaking, all men in Australia are\r\nmagicians, but not one is a priest; everybody fancies he can\r\ninfluence his fellows or the course of nature by sympathetic magic,\r\nbut nobody dreams of propitiating gods by prayer and sacrifice.\r\n\r\nBut if in the most backward state of human society now known to us\r\nwe find magic thus conspicuously present and religion conspicuously\r\nabsent, may we not reasonably conjecture that the civilised races of\r\nthe world have also at some period of their history passed through a\r\nsimilar intellectual phase, that they attempted to force the great\r\npowers of nature to do their pleasure before they thought of\r\ncourting their favour by offerings and prayer--in short that, just\r\nas on the material side of human culture there has everywhere been\r\nan Age of Stone, so on the intellectual side there has everywhere\r\nbeen an Age of Magic? There are reasons for answering this question\r\nin the affirmative. When we survey the existing races of mankind\r\nfrom Greenland to Tierra del Fuego, or from Scotland to Singapore,\r\nwe observe that they are distinguished one from the other by a great\r\nvariety of religions, and that these distinctions are not, so to\r\nspeak, merely coterminous with the broad distinctions of race, but\r\ndescend into the minuter subdivisions of states and commonwealths,\r\nnay, that they honeycomb the town, the village, and even the family,\r\nso that the surface of society all over the world is cracked and\r\nseamed, sapped and mined with rents and fissures and yawning\r\ncrevasses opened up by the disintegrating influence of religious\r\ndissension. Yet when we have penetrated through these differences,\r\nwhich affect mainly the intelligent and thoughtful part of the\r\ncommunity, we shall find underlying them all a solid stratum of\r\nintellectual agreement among the dull, the weak, the ignorant, and\r\nthe superstitious, who constitute, unfortunately, the vast majority\r\nof mankind. One of the great achievements of the nineteenth century\r\nwas to run shafts down into this low mental stratum in many parts of\r\nthe world, and thus to discover its substantial identity everywhere.\r\nIt is beneath our feet--and not very far beneath them--here in\r\nEurope at the present day, and it crops up on the surface in the\r\nheart of the Australian wilderness and wherever the advent of a\r\nhigher civilisation has not crushed it under ground. This universal\r\nfaith, this truly Catholic creed, is a belief in the efficacy of\r\nmagic. While religious systems differ not only in different\r\ncountries, but in the same country in different ages, the system of\r\nsympathetic magic remains everywhere and at all times substantially\r\nalike in its principles and practice. Among the ignorant and\r\nsuperstitious classes of modern Europe it is very much what it was\r\nthousands of years ago in Egypt and India, and what it now is among\r\nthe lowest savages surviving in the remotest corners of the world.\r\nIf the test of truth lay in a show of hands or a counting of heads,\r\nthe system of magic might appeal, with far more reason than the\r\nCatholic Church, to the proud motto, "_Quod semper, quod ubique,\r\nquod ab omnibus,_" as the sure and certain credential of its own\r\ninfallibility.\r\n\r\nIt is not our business here to consider what bearing the permanent\r\nexistence of such a solid layer of savagery beneath the surface of\r\nsociety, and unaffected by the superficial changes of religion and\r\nculture, has upon the future of humanity. The dispassionate\r\nobserver, whose studies have led him to plumb its depths, can hardly\r\nregard it otherwise than as a standing menace to civilisation. We\r\nseem to move on a thin crust which may at any moment be rent by the\r\nsubterranean forces slumbering below. From time to time a hollow\r\nmurmur underground or a sudden spirt of flame into the air tells of\r\nwhat is going on beneath our feet. Now and then the polite world is\r\nstartled by a paragraph in a newspaper which tells how in Scotland\r\nan image has been found stuck full of pins for the purpose of\r\nkilling an obnoxious laird or minister, how a woman has been slowly\r\nroasted to death as a witch in Ireland, or how a girl has been\r\nmurdered and chopped up in Russia to make those candles of human\r\ntallow by whose light thieves hope to pursue their midnight trade\r\nunseen. But whether the influences that make for further progress,\r\nor those that threaten to undo what has already been accomplished,\r\nwill ultimately prevail; whether the impulsive energy of the\r\nminority or the dead weight of the majority of mankind will prove\r\nthe stronger force to carry us up to higher heights or to sink us\r\ninto lower depths, are questions rather for the sage, the moralist,\r\nand the statesman, whose eagle vision scans the future, than for the\r\nhumble student of the present and the past. Here we are only\r\nconcerned to ask how far the uniformity, the universality, and the\r\npermanence of a belief in magic, compared with the endless variety\r\nand the shifting character of religious creeds, raises a presumption\r\nthat the former represents a ruder and earlier phase of the human\r\nmind, through which all the races of mankind have passed or are\r\npassing on their way to religion and science.\r\n\r\nIf an Age of Religion has thus everywhere, as I venture to surmise,\r\nbeen preceded by an Age of Magic, it is natural that we should\r\nenquire what causes have led mankind, or rather a portion of them,\r\nto abandon magic as a principle of faith and practice and to betake\r\nthemselves to religion instead. When we reflect upon the multitude,\r\nthe variety, and the complexity of the facts to be explained, and\r\nthe scantiness of our information regarding them, we shall be ready\r\nto acknowledge that a full and satisfactory solution of so profound\r\na problem is hardly to be hoped for, and that the most we can do in\r\nthe present state of our knowledge is to hazard a more or less\r\nplausible conjecture. With all due diffidence, then, I would suggest\r\nthat a tardy recognition of the inherent falsehood and barrenness of\r\nmagic set the more thoughtful part of mankind to cast about for a\r\ntruer theory of nature and a more fruitful method of turning her\r\nresources to account. The shrewder intelligences must in time have\r\ncome to perceive that magical ceremonies and incantations did not\r\nreally effect the results which they were designed to produce, and\r\nwhich the majority of their simpler fellows still believed that they\r\ndid actually produce. This great discovery of the inefficacy of\r\nmagic must have wrought a radical though probably slow revolution in\r\nthe minds of those who had the sagacity to make it. The discovery\r\namounted to this, that men for the first time recognised their\r\ninability to manipulate at pleasure certain natural forces which\r\nhitherto they had believed to be completely within their control. It\r\nwas a confession of human ignorance and weakness. Man saw that he\r\nhad taken for causes what were no causes, and that all his efforts\r\nto work by means of these imaginary causes had been vain. His\r\npainful toil had been wasted, his curious ingenuity had been\r\nsquandered to no purpose. He had been pulling at strings to which\r\nnothing was attached; he had been marching, as he thought, straight\r\nto the goal, while in reality he had only been treading in a narrow\r\ncircle. Not that the effects which he had striven so hard to produce\r\ndid not continue to manifest themselves. They were still produced,\r\nbut not by him. The rain still fell on the thirsty ground: the sun\r\nstill pursued his daily, and the moon her nightly journey across the\r\nsky: the silent procession of the seasons still moved in light and\r\nshadow, in cloud and sunshine across the earth: men were still born\r\nto labour and sorrow, and still, after a brief sojourn here, were\r\ngathered to their fathers in the long home hereafter. All things\r\nindeed went on as before, yet all seemed different to him from whose\r\neyes the old scales had fallen. For he could no longer cherish the\r\npleasing illusion that it was he who guided the earth and the heaven\r\nin their courses, and that they would cease to perform their great\r\nrevolutions were he to take his feeble hand from the wheel. In the\r\ndeath of his enemies and his friends he no longer saw a proof of the\r\nresistless potency of his own or of hostile enchantments; he now\r\nknew that friends and foes alike had succumbed to a force stronger\r\nthan any that he could wield, and in obedience to a destiny which he\r\nwas powerless to control.\r\n\r\nThus cut adrift from his ancient moorings and left to toss on a\r\ntroubled sea of doubt and uncertainty, his old happy confidence in\r\nhimself and his powers rudely shaken, our primitive philosopher must\r\nhave been sadly perplexed and agitated till he came to rest, as in a\r\nquiet haven after a tempestuous voyage, in a new system of faith and\r\npractice, which seemed to offer a solution of his harassing doubts\r\nand a substitute, however precarious, for that sovereignty over\r\nnature which he had reluctantly abdicated. If the great world went\r\non its way without the help of him or his fellows, it must surely be\r\nbecause there were other beings, like himself, but far stronger,\r\nwho, unseen themselves, directed its course and brought about all\r\nthe varied series of events which he had hitherto believed to be\r\ndependent on his own magic. It was they, as he now believed, and not\r\nhe himself, who made the stormy wind to blow, the lightning to\r\nflash, and the thunder to roll; who had laid the foundations of the\r\nsolid earth and set bounds to the restless sea that it might not\r\npass; who caused all the glorious lights of heaven to shine; who\r\ngave the fowls of the air their meat and the wild beasts of the\r\ndesert their prey; who bade the fruitful land to bring forth in\r\nabundance, the high hills to be clothed with forests, the bubbling\r\nsprings to rise under the rocks in the valleys, and green pastures\r\nto grow by still waters; who breathed into man\'s nostrils and made\r\nhim live, or turned him to destruction by famine and pestilence and\r\nwar. To these mighty beings, whose handiwork he traced in all the\r\ngorgeous and varied pageantry of nature, man now addressed himself,\r\nhumbly confessing his dependence on their invisible power, and\r\nbeseeching them of their mercy to furnish him with all good things,\r\nto defend him from the perils and dangers by which our mortal life\r\nis compassed about on every hand, and finally to bring his immortal\r\nspirit, freed from the burden of the body, to some happier world,\r\nbeyond the reach of pain and sorrow, where he might rest with them\r\nand with the spirits of good men in joy and felicity for ever.\r\n\r\nIn this, or some such way as this, the deeper minds may be conceived\r\nto have made the great transition from magic to religion. But even\r\nin them the change can hardly ever have been sudden; probably it\r\nproceeded very slowly, and required long ages for its more or less\r\nperfect accomplishment. For the recognition of man\'s powerlessness\r\nto influence the course of nature on a grand scale must have been\r\ngradual; he cannot have been shorn of the whole of his fancied\r\ndominion at a blow. Step by step he must have been driven back from\r\nhis proud position; foot by foot he must have yielded, with a sigh,\r\nthe ground which he had once viewed as his own. Now it would be the\r\nwind, now the rain, now the sunshine, now the thunder, that he\r\nconfessed himself unable to wield at will; and as province after\r\nprovince of nature thus fell from his grasp, till what had once\r\nseemed a kingdom threatened to shrink into a prison, man must have\r\nbeen more and more profoundly impressed with a sense of his own\r\nhelplessness and the might of the invisible beings by whom he\r\nbelieved himself to be surrounded. Thus religion, beginning as a\r\nslight and partial acknowledgment of powers superior to man, tends\r\nwith the growth of knowledge to deepen into a confession of man\'s\r\nentire and absolute dependence on the divine; his old free bearing\r\nis exchanged for an attitude of lowliest prostration before the\r\nmysterious powers of the unseen, and his highest virtue is to submit\r\nhis will to theirs: _In la sua volontade \xe8 nostra pace._ But this\r\ndeepening sense of religion, this more perfect submission to the\r\ndivine will in all things, affects only those higher intelligences\r\nwho have breadth of view enough to comprehend the vastness of the\r\nuniverse and the littleness of man. Small minds cannot grasp great\r\nideas; to their narrow comprehension, their purblind vision, nothing\r\nseems really great and important but themselves. Such minds hardly\r\nrise into religion at all. They are, indeed, drilled by their\r\nbetters into an outward conformity with its precepts and a verbal\r\nprofession of its tenets; but at heart they cling to their old\r\nmagical superstitions, which may be discountenanced and forbidden,\r\nbut cannot be eradicated by religion, so long as they have their\r\nroots deep down in the mental framework and constitution of the\r\ngreat majority of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe reader may well be tempted to ask, How was it that intelligent\r\nmen did not sooner detect the fallacy of magic? How could they\r\ncontinue to cherish expectations that were invariably doomed to\r\ndisappointment? With what heart persist in playing venerable antics\r\nthat led to nothing, and mumbling solemn balderdash that remained\r\nwithout effect? Why cling to beliefs which were so flatly\r\ncontradicted by experience? How dare to repeat experiments that had\r\nfailed so often? The answer seems to be that the fallacy was far\r\nfrom easy to detect, the failure by no means obvious, since in many,\r\nperhaps in most cases, the desired event did actually follow, at a\r\nlonger or shorter interval, the performance of the rite which was\r\ndesigned to bring it about; and a mind of more than common acuteness\r\nwas needed to perceive that, even in these cases, the rite was not\r\nnecessarily the cause of the event. A ceremony intended to make the\r\nwind blow or the rain fall, or to work the death of an enemy, will\r\nalways be followed, sooner or later, by the occurrence it is meant\r\nto bring to pass; and primitive man may be excused for regarding the\r\noccurrence as a direct result of the ceremony, and the best possible\r\nproof of its efficacy. Similarly, rites observed in the morning to\r\nhelp the sun to rise, and in spring to wake the dreaming earth from\r\nher winter sleep, will invariably appear to be crowned with success,\r\nat least within the temperate zones; for in these regions the sun\r\nlights his golden lamp in the east every morning, and year by year\r\nthe vernal earth decks herself afresh with a rich mantle of green.\r\nHence the practical savage, with his conservative instincts, might\r\nwell turn a deaf ear to the subtleties of the theoretical doubter,\r\nthe philosophic radical, who presumed to hint that sunrise and\r\nspring might not, after all, be direct consequences of the punctual\r\nperformance of certain daily or yearly ceremonies, and that the sun\r\nmight perhaps continue to rise and trees to blossom though the\r\nceremonies were occasionally intermitted, or even discontinued\r\naltogether. These sceptical doubts would naturally be repelled by\r\nthe other with scorn and indignation as airy reveries subversive of\r\nthe faith and manifestly contradicted by experience. "Can anything\r\nbe plainer," he might say, "than that I light my twopenny candle on\r\nearth and that the sun then kindles his great fire in heaven? I\r\nshould be glad to know whether, when I have put on my green robe in\r\nspring, the trees do not afterwards do the same? These are facts\r\npatent to everybody, and on them I take my stand. I am a plain\r\npractical man, not one of your theorists and splitters of hairs and\r\nchoppers of logic. Theories and speculation and all that may be very\r\nwell in their way, and I have not the least objection to your\r\nindulging in them, provided, of course, you do not put them in\r\npractice. But give me leave to stick to facts; then I know where I\r\nam." The fallacy of this reasoning is obvious to us, because it\r\nhappens to deal with facts about which we have long made up our\r\nminds. But let an argument of precisely the same calibre be applied\r\nto matters which are still under debate, and it may be questioned\r\nwhether a British audience would not applaud it as sound, and esteem\r\nthe speaker who used it a safe man--not brilliant or showy, perhaps,\r\nbut thoroughly sensible and hard-headed. If such reasonings could\r\npass muster among ourselves, need we wonder that they long escaped\r\ndetection by the savage?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. The Magical Control of the Weather\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Public Magician\r\n\r\nTHE READER may remember that we were led to plunge into the\r\nlabyrinth of magic by a consideration of two different types of\r\nman-god. This is the clue which has guided our devious steps through\r\nthe maze, and brought us out at last on higher ground, whence,\r\nresting a little by the way, we can look back over the path we have\r\nalready traversed and forward to the longer and steeper road we have\r\nstill to climb.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the foregoing discussion, the two types of human gods\r\nmay conveniently be distinguished as the religious and the magical\r\nman-god respectively. In the former, a being of an order different\r\nfrom and superior to man is supposed to become incarnate, for a\r\nlonger or a shorter time, in a human body, manifesting his\r\nsuper-human power and knowledge by miracles wrought and prophecies\r\nuttered through the medium of the fleshly tabernacle in which he has\r\ndeigned to take up his abode. This may also appropriately be called\r\nthe inspired or incarnate type of man-god. In it the human body is\r\nmerely a frail earthly vessel filled with a divine and immortal\r\nspirit. On the other hand, a man-god of the magical sort is nothing\r\nbut a man who possesses in an unusually high degree powers which\r\nmost of his fellows arrogate to themselves on a smaller scale; for\r\nin rude society there is hardly a person who does not dabble in\r\nmagic. Thus, whereas a man-god of the former or inspired type\r\nderives his divinity from a deity who has stooped to hide his\r\nheavenly radiance behind a dull mask of earthly mould, a man-god of\r\nthe latter type draws his extraordinary power from a certain\r\nphysical sympathy with nature. He is not merely the receptacle of a\r\ndivine spirit. His whole being, body and soul, is so delicately\r\nattuned to the harmony of the world that a touch of his hand or a\r\nturn of his head may send a thrill vibrating through the universal\r\nframework of things; and conversely his divine organism is acutely\r\nsensitive to such slight changes of environment as would leave\r\nordinary mortals wholly unaffected. But the line between these two\r\ntypes of man-god, however sharply we may draw it in theory, is\r\nseldom to be traced with precision in practice, and in what follows\r\nI shall not insist on it.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in practice the magic art may be employed for the\r\nbenefit either of individuals or of the whole community, and that\r\naccording as it is directed to one or other of these two objects it\r\nmay be called private or public magic. Further, I pointed out that\r\nthe public magician occupies a position of great influence, from\r\nwhich, if he is a prudent and able man, he may advance step by step\r\nto the rank of a chief or king. Thus an examination of public magic\r\nconduces to an understanding of the early kingship, since in savage\r\nand barbarous society many chiefs and kings appear to owe their\r\nauthority in great measure to their reputation as magicians.\r\n\r\nAmong the objects of public utility which magic may be employed to\r\nsecure, the most essential is an adequate supply of food. The\r\nexamples cited in preceding pages prove that the purveyors of\r\nfood--the hunter, the fisher, the farmer--all resort to magical\r\npractices in the pursuit of their various callings; but they do so\r\nas private individuals for the benefit of themselves and their\r\nfamilies, rather than as public functionaries acting in the interest\r\nof the whole people. It is otherwise when the rites are performed,\r\nnot by the hunters, the fishers, the farmers themselves, but by\r\nprofessional magicians on their behalf. In primitive society, where\r\nuniformity of occupation is the rule, and the distribution of the\r\ncommunity into various classes of workers has hardly begun, every\r\nman is more or less his own magician; he practises charms and\r\nincantations for his own good and the injury of his enemies. But a\r\ngreat step in advance has been taken when a special class of\r\nmagicians has been instituted; when, in other words, a number of men\r\nhave been set apart for the express purpose of benefiting the whole\r\ncommunity by their skill, whether that skill be directed to the\r\nhealing of diseases, the forecasting of the future, the regulation\r\nof the weather, or any other object of general utility. The\r\nimpotence of the means adopted by most of these practitioners to\r\naccomplish their ends ought not to blind us to the immense\r\nimportance of the institution itself. Here is a body of men\r\nrelieved, at least in the higher stages of savagery, from the need\r\nof earning their livelihood by hard manual toil, and allowed, nay,\r\nexpected and encouraged, to prosecute researches into the secret\r\nways of nature. It was at once their duty and their interest to know\r\nmore than their fellows, to acquaint themselves with everything that\r\ncould aid man in his arduous struggle with nature, everything that\r\ncould mitigate his sufferings and prolong his life. The properties\r\nof drugs and minerals, the causes of rain and drought, of thunder\r\nand lightning, the changes of the seasons, the phases of the moon,\r\nthe daily and yearly journeys of the sun, the motions of the stars,\r\nthe mystery of life, and the mystery of death, all these things must\r\nhave excited the wonder of these early philosophers, and stimulated\r\nthem to find solutions of problems that were doubtless often thrust\r\non their attention in the most practical form by the importunate\r\ndemands of their clients, who expected them not merely to understand\r\nbut to regulate the great processes of nature for the good of man.\r\nThat their first shots fell very far wide of the mark could hardly\r\nbe helped. The slow, the never-ending approach to truth consists in\r\nperpetually forming and testing hypotheses, accepting those which at\r\nthe time seem to fit the facts and rejecting the others. The views\r\nof natural causation embraced by the savage magician no doubt appear\r\nto us manifestly false and absurd; yet in their day they were\r\nlegitimate hypotheses, though they have not stood the test of\r\nexperience. Ridicule and blame are the just meed, not of those who\r\ndevised these crude theories, but of those who obstinately adhered\r\nto them after better had been propounded. Certainly no men ever had\r\nstronger incentives in the pursuit of truth than these savage\r\nsorcerers. To maintain at least a show of knowledge was absolutely\r\nnecessary; a single mistake detected might cost them their life.\r\nThis no doubt led them to practise imposture for the purpose of\r\nconcealing their ignorance; but it also supplied them with the most\r\npowerful motive for substituting a real for a sham knowledge, since,\r\nif you would appear to know anything, by far the best way is\r\nactually to know it. Thus, however justly we may reject the\r\nextravagant pretensions of magicians and condemn the deceptions\r\nwhich they have practised on mankind, the original institution of\r\nthis class of men has, take it all in all, been productive of\r\nincalculable good to humanity. They were the direct predecessors,\r\nnot merely of our physicians and surgeons, but of our investigators\r\nand discoverers in every branch of natural science. They began the\r\nwork which has since been carried to such glorious and beneficent\r\nissues by their successors in after ages; and if the beginning was\r\npoor and feeble, this is to be imputed to the inevitable\r\ndifficulties which beset the path of knowledge rather than to the\r\nnatural incapacity or wilful fraud of the men themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Magical Control of Rain\r\n\r\nOF THE THINGS which the public magician sets himself to do for the\r\ngood of the tribe, one of the chief is to control the weather and\r\nespecially to ensure an adequate fall of rain. Water is an essential\r\nof life, and in most countries the supply of it depends upon\r\nshowers. Without rain vegetation withers, animals and men languish\r\nand die. Hence in savage communities the rain-maker is a very\r\nimportant personage; and often a special class of magicians exists\r\nfor the purpose of regulating the heavenly water-supply. The methods\r\nby which they attempt to discharge the duties of their office are\r\ncommonly, though not always, based on the principle of homoeopathic\r\nor imitative magic. If they wish to make rain they simulate it by\r\nsprinkling water or mimicking clouds: if their object is to stop\r\nrain and cause drought, they avoid water and resort to warmth and\r\nfire for the sake of drying up the too abundant moisture. Such\r\nattempts are by no means confined, as the cultivated reader might\r\nimagine, to the naked inhabitants of those sultry lands like Central\r\nAustralia and some parts of Eastern and Southern Africa, where often\r\nfor months together the pitiless sun beats down out of a blue and\r\ncloudless sky on the parched and gaping earth. They are, or used to\r\nbe, common enough among outwardly civilised folk in the moister\r\nclimate of Europe. I will now illustrate them by instances drawn\r\nfrom the practice both of public and private magic.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, in a village near Dorpat, in Russia, when rain\r\nwas much wanted, three men used to climb up the fir-trees of an old\r\nsacred grove. One of them drummed with a hammer on a kettle or small\r\ncask to imitate thunder; the second knocked two fire-brands together\r\nand made the sparks fly, to imitate lightning; and the third, who\r\nwas called "the rain-maker," had a bunch of twigs with which he\r\nsprinkled water from a vessel on all sides. To put an end to drought\r\nand bring down rain, women and girls of the village of Ploska are\r\nwont to go naked by night to the boundaries of the village and there\r\npour water on the ground. In Halmahera, or Gilolo, a large island to\r\nthe west of New Guinea, a wizard makes rain by dipping a branch of a\r\nparticular kind of tree in water and then scattering the moisture\r\nfrom the dripping bough over the ground. In New Britain the\r\nrain-maker wraps some leaves of a red and green striped creeper in a\r\nbanana-leaf, moistens the bundle with water, and buries it in the\r\nground; then he imitates with his mouth the plashing of rain.\r\nAmongst the Omaha Indians of North America, when the corn is\r\nwithering for want of rain, the members of the sacred Buffalo\r\nSociety fill a large vessel with water and dance four times round\r\nit. One of them drinks some of the water and spirts it into the air,\r\nmaking a fine spray in imitation of a mist or drizzling rain. Then\r\nhe upsets the vessel, spilling the water on the ground; whereupon\r\nthe dancers fall down and drink up the water, getting mud all over\r\ntheir faces. Lastly, they squirt the water into the air, making a\r\nfine mist. This saves the corn. In spring-time the Natchez of North\r\nAmerica used to club together to purchase favourable weather for\r\ntheir crops from the wizards. If rain was needed, the wizards fasted\r\nand danced with pipes full of water in their mouths. The pipes were\r\nperforated like the nozzle of a watering-can, and through the holes\r\nthe rain-maker blew the water towards that part of the sky where the\r\nclouds hung heaviest. But if fine weather was wanted, he mounted the\r\nroof of his hut, and with extended arms, blowing with all his might,\r\nhe beckoned to the clouds to pass by. When the rains do not come in\r\ndue season the people of Central Angoniland repair to what is called\r\nthe rain-temple. Here they clear away the grass, and the leader\r\npours beer into a pot which is buried in the ground, while he says,\r\n"Master _Chauta,_ you have hardened your heart towards us, what\r\nwould you have us do? We must perish indeed. Give your children the\r\nrains, there is the beer we have given you." Then they all partake\r\nof the beer that is left over, even the children being made to sip\r\nit. Next they take branches of trees and dance and sing for rain.\r\nWhen they return to the village they find a vessel of water set at\r\nthe doorway by an old woman; so they dip their branches in it and\r\nwave them aloft, so as to scatter the drops. After that the rain is\r\nsure to come driving up in heavy clouds. In these practices we see a\r\ncombination of religion with magic; for while the scattering of the\r\nwater-drops by means of branches is a purely magical ceremony, the\r\nprayer for rain and the offering of beer are purely religious rites.\r\nIn the Mara tribe of Northern Australia the rain-maker goes to a\r\npool and sings over it his magic song. Then he takes some of the\r\nwater in his hands, drinks it, and spits it out in various\r\ndirections. After that he throws water all over himself, scatters it\r\nabout, and returns quietly to the camp. Rain is supposed to follow.\r\nThe Arab historian Makrizi describes a method of stopping rain which\r\nis said to have been resorted to by a tribe of nomads called Alqamar\r\nin Hadramaut. They cut a branch from a certain tree in the desert,\r\nset it on fire, and then sprinkled the burning brand with water.\r\nAfter that the vehemence of the rain abated, just as the water\r\nvanished when it fell on the glowing brand. Some of the Eastern\r\nAngamis of Manipur are said to perform a some-what similar ceremony\r\nfor the opposite purpose, in order, namely, to produce rain. The\r\nhead of the village puts a burning brand on the grave of a man who\r\nhas died of burns, and quenches the brand with water, while he prays\r\nthat rain may fall. Here the putting out the fire with water, which\r\nis an imitation of rain, is reinforced by the influence of the dead\r\nman, who, having been burnt to death, will naturally be anxious for\r\nthe descent of rain to cool his scorched body and assuage his pangs.\r\n\r\nOther people besides the Arabs have used fire as a means of stopping\r\nrain. Thus the Sulka of New Britain heat stones red hot in the fire\r\nand then put them out in the rain, or they throw hot ashes in the\r\nair. They think that the rain will soon cease to fall, for it does\r\nnot like to be burned by the hot stones or ashes. The Telugus send a\r\nlittle girl out naked into the rain with a burning piece of wood in\r\nher hand, which she has to show to the rain. That is supposed to\r\nstop the downpour. At Port Stevens in New South Wales the\r\nmedicine-men used to drive away rain by throwing fire-sticks into\r\nthe air, while at the same time they puffed and shouted. Any man of\r\nthe Anula tribe in Northern Australia can stop rain by simply\r\nwarming a green stick in the fire, and then striking it against the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nIn time of severe drought the Dieri of Central Australia, loudly\r\nlamenting the impoverished state of the country and their own\r\nhalf-starved condition, call upon the spirits of their remote\r\npredecessors, whom they call Mura-muras, to grant them power to make\r\na heavy rain-fall. For they believe that the clouds are bodies in\r\nwhich rain is generated by their own ceremonies or those of\r\nneighbouring tribes, through the influence of the Mura-muras. The\r\nway in which they set about drawing rain from the clouds is this. A\r\nhole is dug about twelve feet long and eight or ten broad, and over\r\nthis hole a conical hut of logs and branches is made. Two wizards,\r\nsupposed to have received a special inspiration from the Mura-muras,\r\nare bled by an old and influential man with a sharp flint; and the\r\nblood, drawn from their arms below the elbow, is made to flow on the\r\nother men of the tribe, who sit huddled together in the hut. At the\r\nsame time the two bleeding men throw handfuls of down about, some of\r\nwhich adheres to the blood-stained bodies of their comrades, while\r\nthe rest floats in the air. The blood is thought to represent the\r\nrain, and the down the clouds. During the ceremony two large stones\r\nare placed in the middle of the hut; they stand for gathering clouds\r\nand presage rain. Then the wizards who were bled carry away the two\r\nstones for about ten or fifteen miles, and place them as high as\r\nthey can in the tallest tree. Meanwhile the other men gather gypsum,\r\npound it fine, and throw it into a water-hole. This the Mura-muras\r\nsee, and at once they cause clouds to appear in the sky. Lastly, the\r\nmen, young and old, surround the hut, and, stooping down, butt at it\r\nwith their heads, like so many rams. Thus they force their way\r\nthrough it and reappear on the other side, repeating the process\r\ntill the hut is wrecked. In doing this they are forbidden to use\r\ntheir hands or arms; but when the heavy logs alone remain, they are\r\nallowed to pull them out with their hands. "The piercing of the hut\r\nwith their heads symbolises the piercing of the clouds; the fall of\r\nthe hut, the fall of the rain." Obviously, too, the act of placing\r\nhigh up in trees the two stones, which stand for clouds, is a way of\r\nmaking the real clouds to mount up in the sky. The Dieri also\r\nimagine that the foreskins taken from lads at circumcision have a\r\ngreat power of producing rain. Hence the Great Council of the tribe\r\nalways keeps a small stock of foreskins ready for use. They are\r\ncarefully concealed, being wrapt up in feathers with the fat of the\r\nwild dog and of the carpet snake. A woman may not see such a parcel\r\nopened on any account. When the ceremony is over, the foreskin is\r\nburied, its virtue being exhausted. After the rains have fallen,\r\nsome of the tribe always undergo a surgical operation, which\r\nconsists in cutting the skin of their chest and arms with a sharp\r\nflint. The wound is then tapped with a flat stick to increase the\r\nflow of blood, and red ochre is rubbed into it. Raised scars are\r\nthus produced. The reason alleged by the natives for this practice\r\nis that they are pleased with the rain, and that there is a\r\nconnexion between the rain and the scars. Apparently the operation\r\nis not very painful, for the patient laughs and jokes while it is\r\ngoing on. Indeed, little children have been seen to crowd round the\r\noperator and patiently take their turn; then after being operated\r\non, they ran away, expanding their little chests and singing for the\r\nrain to beat upon them. However, they were not so well pleased next\r\nday, when they felt their wounds stiff and sore. In Java, when rain\r\nis wanted, two men will sometimes thrash each other with supple rods\r\ntill the blood flows down their backs; the streaming blood\r\nrepresents the rain, and no doubt is supposed to make it fall on the\r\nground. The people of Egghiou, a district of Abyssinia, used to\r\nengage in sanguinary conflicts with each other, village against\r\nvillage, for a week together every January for the purpose of\r\nprocuring rain. Some years ago the emperor Menelik forbade the\r\ncustom. However, the following year the rain was deficient, and the\r\npopular outcry so great that the emperor yielded to it, and allowed\r\nthe murderous fights to be resumed, but for two days a year only.\r\nThe writer who mentions the custom regards the blood shed on these\r\noccasions as a propitiatory sacrifice offered to spirits who control\r\nthe showers; but perhaps, as in the Australian and Javanese\r\nceremonies, it is an imitation of rain. The prophets of Baal, who\r\nsought to procure rain by cutting themselves with knives till the\r\nblood gushed out, may have acted on the same principle.\r\n\r\nThere is a widespread belief that twin children possess magical\r\npowers over nature, especially over rain and the weather. This\r\ncurious superstition prevails among some of the Indian tribes of\r\nBritish Columbia, and has led them often to impose certain singular\r\nrestrictions or taboos on the parents of twins, though the exact\r\nmeaning of these restrictions is generally obscure. Thus the\r\nTsimshian Indians of British Columbia believe that twins control the\r\nweather; therefore they pray to wind and rain, "Calm down, breath of\r\nthe twins." Further, they think that the wishes of twins are always\r\nfulfilled; hence twins are feared, because they can harm the man\r\nthey hate. They can also call the salmon and the olachen or\r\ncandle-fish, and so they are known by a name which means "making\r\nplentiful." In the opinion of the Kwakiutl Indians of British\r\nColumbia twins are transformed salmon; hence they may not go near\r\nwater, lest they should be changed back again into the fish. In\r\ntheir childhood they can summon any wind by motions of their hands,\r\nand they can make fair or foul weather, and also cure diseases by\r\nswinging a large wooden rattle. The Nootka Indians of British\r\nColumbia also believe that twins are somehow related to salmon.\r\nHence among them twins may not catch salmon, and they may not eat or\r\neven handle the fresh fish. They can make fair or foul weather, and\r\ncan cause rain to fall by painting their faces black and then\r\nwashing them, which may represent the rain dripping from the dark\r\nclouds. The Shuswap Indians, like the Thompson Indians, associate\r\ntwins with the grizzly bear, for they call them "young grizzly\r\nbears." According to them, twins remain throughout life endowed with\r\nsupernatural powers. In particular they can make good or bad\r\nweather. They produce rain by spilling water from a basket in the\r\nair; they make fine weather by shaking a small flat piece of wood\r\nattached to a stick by a string; they raise storms by strewing down\r\non the ends of spruce branches.\r\n\r\nThe same power of influencing the weather is attributed to twins by\r\nthe Baronga, a tribe of Bantu negroes who, inhabit the shores of\r\nDelagoa Bay in South-eastern Africa. They bestow the name of\r\n_Tilo_--that is, the sky--on a woman who has given birth to twins,\r\nand the infants themselves are called the children of the sky. Now\r\nwhen the storms which generally burst in the months of September and\r\nOctober have been looked for in vain, when a drought with its\r\nprospect of famine is threatening, and all nature, scorched and\r\nburnt up by a sun that has shone for six months from a cloudless\r\nsky, is panting for the beneficent showers of the South African\r\nspring, the women perform ceremonies to bring down the longed-for\r\nrain on the parched earth. Stripping themselves of all their\r\ngarments, they assume in their stead girdles and head-dresses of\r\ngrass, or short petticoats made of the leaves of a particular sort\r\nof creeper. Thus attired, uttering peculiar cries and singing ribald\r\nsongs, they go about from well to well, cleansing them of the mud\r\nand impurities which have accumulated in them. The wells, it may be\r\nsaid, are merely holes in the sand where a little turbid unwholesome\r\nwater stagnates. Further, the women must repair to the house of one\r\nof their gossips who has given birth to twins, and must drench her\r\nwith water, which they carry in little pitchers. Having done so they\r\ngo on their way, shrieking out their loose songs and dancing\r\nimmodest dances. No man may see these leaf-clad women going their\r\nrounds. If they meet a man, they maul him and thrust him aside. When\r\nthey have cleansed the wells, they must go and pour water on the\r\ngraves of their ancestors in the sacred grove. It often happens,\r\ntoo, that at the bidding of the wizard they go and pour water on the\r\ngraves of twins. For they think that the grave of a twin ought\r\nalways to be moist, for which reason twins are regularly buried near\r\na lake. If all their efforts to procure rain prove abortive, they\r\nwill remember that such and such a twin was buried in a dry place on\r\nthe side of a hill. "No wonder," says the wizard in such a case,\r\n"that the sky is fiery. Take up his body and dig him a grave on the\r\nshore of the lake." His orders are at once obeyed, for this is\r\nsupposed to be the only means of bringing down the rain.\r\n\r\nSome of the foregoing facts strongly support an interpretation which\r\nProfessor Oldenberg has given of the rules to be observed by a\r\nBrahman who would learn a particular hymn of the ancient Indian\r\ncollection known as the Samaveda. The hymn, which bears the name of\r\nthe Sakvari\xaf song, was believed to embody the might of Indra\'s\r\nweapon, the thunderbolt; and hence, on account of the dreadful and\r\ndangerous potency with which it was thus charged, the bold student\r\nwho essayed to master it had to be isolated from his fellow-men, and\r\nto retire from the village into the forest. Here for a space of\r\ntime, which might vary, according to different doctors of the law,\r\nfrom one to twelve years, he had to observe certain rules of life,\r\namong which were the following. Thrice a day he had to touch water;\r\nhe must wear black garments and eat black food; when it rained, he\r\nmight not seek the shelter of a roof, but had to sit in the rain and\r\nsay, "Water is the Sakvari\xaf song"; when the lightning flashed, he\r\nsaid, "That is like the Sakvari\xaf song"; when the thunder pealed, he\r\nsaid, "The Great One is making a great noise." He might never cross\r\na running stream without touching water; he might never set foot on\r\na ship unless his life were in danger, and even then he must be sure\r\nto touch water when he went on board; "for in water," so ran the\r\nsaying, "lies the virtue of the Sakvari\xaf song." When at last he was\r\nallowed to learn the song itself, he had to dip his hands in a\r\nvessel of water in which plants of all sorts had been placed. If a\r\nman walked in the way of all these precepts, the rain-god Parjanya,\r\nit was said, would send rain at the wish of that man. It is clear,\r\nas Professor Oldenberg well points out, that "all these rules are\r\nintended to bring the Brahman into union with water, to make him, as\r\nit were, an ally of the water powers, and to guard him against their\r\nhostility. The black garments and the black food have the same\r\nsignificance; no one will doubt that they refer to the rain-clouds\r\nwhen he remembers that a black victim is sacrificed to procure rain;\r\n\'it is black, for such is the nature of rain.\' In respect of another\r\nrain-charm it is said plainly, \'He puts on a black garment edged\r\nwith black, for such is the nature of rain.\' We may therefore assume\r\nthat here in the circle of ideas and ordinances of the Vedic schools\r\nthere have been preserved magical practices of the most remote\r\nantiquity, which were intended to prepare the rain-maker for his\r\noffice and dedicate him to it."\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe that where an opposite result is\r\ndesired, primitive logic enjoins the weather-doctor to observe\r\nprecisely opposite rules of conduct. In the tropical island of Java,\r\nwhere the rich vegetation attests the abundance of the rainfall,\r\nceremonies for the making of rain are rare, but ceremonies for the\r\nprevention of it are not uncommon. When a man is about to give a\r\ngreat feast in the rainy season and has invited many people, he goes\r\nto a weather-doctor and asks him to "prop up the clouds that may be\r\nlowering." If the doctor consents to exert his professional powers,\r\nhe begins to regulate his behaviour by certain rules as soon as his\r\ncustomer has departed. He must observe a fast, and may neither drink\r\nnor bathe; what little he eats must be eaten dry, and in no case may\r\nhe touch water. The host, on his side, and his servants, both male\r\nand female, must neither wash clothes nor bathe so long as the feast\r\nlasts, and they have all during its continuance to observe strict\r\nchastity. The doctor seats himself on a new mat in his bedroom, and\r\nbefore a small oil-lamp he murmurs, shortly before the feast takes\r\nplace, the following prayer or incantation: "Grandfather and\r\nGrandmother Sroekoel" (the name seems to be taken at random; others\r\nare sometimes used), "return to your country. Akkemat is your\r\ncountry. Put down your water-cask, close it properly, that not a\r\ndrop may fall out." While he utters this prayer the sorcerer looks\r\nupwards, burning incense the while. So among the Toradjas the\r\nrain-doctor, whose special business it is to drive away rain, takes\r\ncare not to touch water before, during, or after the discharge of\r\nhis professional duties. He does not bathe, he eats with unwashed\r\nhands, he drinks nothing but palm wine, and if he has to cross a\r\nstream he is careful not to step in the water. Having thus prepared\r\nhimself for his task he has a small hut built for himself outside of\r\nthe village in a rice-field, and in this hut he keeps up a little\r\nfire, which on no account may be suffered to go out. In the fire he\r\nburns various kinds of wood, which are supposed to possess the\r\nproperty of driving off rain; and he puffs in the direction from\r\nwhich the rain threatens to come, holding in his hand a packet of\r\nleaves and bark which derive a similar cloud-compelling virtue, not\r\nfrom their chemical composition, but from their names, which happen\r\nto signify something dry or volatile. If clouds should appear in the\r\nsky while he is at work, he takes lime in the hollow of his hand and\r\nblows it towards them. The lime, being so very dry, is obviously\r\nwell adapted to disperse the damp clouds. Should rain afterwards be\r\nwanted, he has only to pour water on his fire, and immediately the\r\nrain will descend in sheets.\r\n\r\nThe reader will observe how exactly the Javanese and Toradja\r\nobservances, which are intended to prevent rain, form the antithesis\r\nof the Indian observances, which aim at producing it. The Indian\r\nsage is commanded to touch water thrice a day regularly as well as\r\non various special occasions; the Javanese and Toradja wizards may\r\nnot touch it at all. The Indian lives out in the forest, and even\r\nwhen it rains he may not take shelter; the Javanese and the Toradja\r\nsit in a house or a hut. The one signifies his sympathy with water\r\nby receiving the rain on his person and speaking of it respectfully;\r\nthe others light a lamp or a fire and do their best to drive the\r\nrain away. Yet the principle on which all three act is the same;\r\neach of them, by a sort of childish make-believe, identifies himself\r\nwith the phenomenon which he desires to produce. It is the old\r\nfallacy that the effect resembles its cause: if you would make wet\r\nweather, you must be wet; if you would make dry weather, you must be\r\ndry.\r\n\r\nIn South-eastern Europe at the present day ceremonies are\r\nobserved for the purpose of making rain which not only rest on the\r\nsame general train of thought as the preceding, but even in their\r\ndetails resemble the ceremonies practised with the same intention\r\nby the Baronga of Delagoa Bay. Among the Greeks of Thessaly and\r\nMacedonia, when a drought has lasted a long time, it is customary\r\nto send a procession of children round to all the wells and springs\r\nof the neighbourhood. At the head of the procession walks a girl\r\nadorned with flowers, whom her companions drench with water at\r\nevery halting-place, while they sing an invocation, of which the\r\nfollowing is part:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "Perperia all fresh bedewed,\r\n    Freshen all the neighbourhood;\r\n    By the woods, on the highway,\r\n    As thou goest, to God now pray:\r\n    O my God, upon the plain,\r\n    Send thou us a still, small rain;\r\n    That the fields may fruitful be,\r\n    And vines in blossom we may see;\r\n    That the grain be full and sound,\r\n    And wealthy grow the folks around."\r\n\r\n\r\nIn time of drought the Serbians strip a girl to her skin and clothe\r\nher from head to foot in grass, herbs, and flowers, even her face\r\nbeing hidden behind a veil of living green. Thus disguised she is\r\ncalled the Dodola, and goes through the village with a troop of\r\ngirls. They stop before every house; the Dodola keeps turning\r\nherself round and dancing, while the other girls form a ring about\r\nher singing one of the Dodola songs, and the housewife pours a pail\r\nof water over her. One of the songs they sing runs thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "We go through the village;\r\n    The clouds go in the sky;\r\n    We go faster,\r\n    Faster go the clouds;\r\n    They have overtaken us,\r\n    And wetted the corn and the vine."\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Poona in India, when rain is needed, the boys dress up one of\r\ntheir number in nothing but leaves and call him King of Rain. Then\r\nthey go round to every house in the village, where the house-holder\r\nor his wife sprinkles the Rain King with water, and gives the party\r\nfood of various kinds. When they have thus visited all the houses,\r\nthey strip the Rain King of his leafy robes and feast upon what they\r\nhave gathered.\r\n\r\nBathing is practised as a rain-charm in some parts of Southern and\r\nWestern Russia. Sometimes after service in church the priest in his\r\nrobes has been thrown down on the ground and drenched with water by\r\nhis parishioners. Sometimes it is the women who, without stripping\r\noff their clothes, bathe in crowds on the day of St. John the\r\nBaptist, while they dip in the water a figure made of branches,\r\ngrass, and herbs, which is supposed to represent the saint. In\r\nKursk, a province of Southern Russia, when rain is much wanted, the\r\nwomen seize a passing stranger and throw him into the river, or\r\nsouse him from head to foot. Later on we shall see that a passing\r\nstranger is often taken for a deity or the personification of some\r\nnatural power. It is recorded in official documents that during a\r\ndrought in 1790 the peasants of Scheroutz and Werboutz collected all\r\nthe women and compelled them to bathe, in order that rain might\r\nfall. An Armenian rain-charm is to throw the wife of a priest into\r\nthe water and drench her. The Arabs of North Africa fling a holy\r\nman, willy-nilly, into a spring as a remedy for drought. In\r\nMinahassa, a province of North Celebes, the priest bathes as a\r\nrain-charm. In Central Celebes when there has been no rain for a\r\nlong time and the rice-stalks begin to shrivel up, many of the\r\nvillagers, especially the young folk, go to a neighbouring brook and\r\nsplash each other with water, shouting noisily, or squirt water on\r\none another through bamboo tubes. Sometimes they imitate the plump\r\nof rain by smacking the surface of the water with their hands, or by\r\nplacing an inverted gourd on it and drumming on the gourd with their\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\nWomen are sometimes supposed to be able to make rain by ploughing,\r\nor pretending to plough. Thus the Pshaws and Chewsurs of the\r\nCaucasus have a ceremony called "ploughing the rain," which they\r\nobserve in time of drought. Girls yoke themselves to a plough and\r\ndrag it into a river, wading in the water up to their girdles. In\r\nthe same circumstances Armenian girls and women do the same. The\r\noldest woman, or the priest\'s wife, wears the priest\'s dress, while\r\nthe others, dressed as men, drag the plough through the water\r\nagainst the stream. In the Caucasian province of Georgia, when a\r\ndrought has lasted long, marriageable girls are yoked in couples\r\nwith an ox-yoke on their shoulders, a priest holds the reins, and\r\nthus harnessed they wade through rivers, puddles, and marshes,\r\npraying, screaming, weeping, and laughing. In a district of\r\nTransylvania when the ground is parched with drought, some girls\r\nstrip themselves naked, and, led by an older woman, who is also\r\nnaked, they steal a harrow and carry it across the fields to a\r\nbrook, where they set it afloat. Next they sit on the harrow and\r\nkeep a tiny flame burning on each corner of it for an hour. Then\r\nthey leave the harrow in the water and go home. A similar rain-charm\r\nis resorted to in some parts of India; naked women drag a plough\r\nacross a field by night, while the men keep carefully out of the\r\nway, for their presence would break the spell.\r\n\r\nSometimes the rain-charm operates through the dead. Thus in New\r\nCaledonia the rain-makers blackened themselves all over, dug up a\r\ndead body, took the bones to a cave, jointed them, and hung the\r\nskeleton over some taro leaves. Water was poured over the skeleton\r\nto run down on the leaves. They believed that the soul of the\r\ndeceased took up the water, converted it into rain, and showered it\r\ndown again. In Russia, if common report may be believed, it is not\r\nlong since the peasants of any district that chanced to be afflicted\r\nwith drought used to dig up the corpse of some one who had drunk\r\nhimself to death and sink it in the nearest swamp or lake, fully\r\npersuaded that this would ensure the fall of the needed rain. In\r\n1868 the prospect of a bad harvest, caused by a prolonged drought,\r\ninduced the inhabitants of a village in the Tarashchansk district to\r\ndig up the body of a Raskolnik, or Dissenter, who had died in the\r\npreceding December. Some of the party beat the corpse, or what was\r\nleft of it, about the head, exclaiming, "Give us rain!" while others\r\npoured water on it through a sieve. Here the pouring of water\r\nthrough a sieve seems plainly an imitation of a shower, and reminds\r\nus of the manner in which Strepsiades in Aristophanes imagined that\r\nrain was made by Zeus. Sometimes, in order to procure rain, the\r\nToradjas make an appeal to the pity of the dead. Thus, in the\r\nvillage of Kalingooa, there is the grave of a famous chief, the\r\ngrandfather of the present ruler. When the land suffers from\r\nunseasonable drought, the people go to this grave, pour water on it,\r\nand say, "O grandfather, have pity on us; if it is your will that\r\nthis year we should eat, then give rain." After that they hang a\r\nbamboo full of water over the grave; there is a small hole in the\r\nlower end of the bamboo, so that the water drips from it\r\ncontinually. The bamboo is always refilled with water until rain\r\ndrenches the ground. Here, as in New Caledonia, we find religion\r\nblent with magic, for the prayer to the dead chief, which is purely\r\nreligious, is eked out with a magical imitation of rain at his\r\ngrave. We have seen that the Baronga of Delagoa Bay drench the tombs\r\nof their ancestors, especially the tombs of twins, as a raincharm.\r\nAmong some of the Indian tribes in the region of the Orinoco it was\r\ncustomary for the relations of a deceased person to disinter his\r\nbones a year after burial, burn them, and scatter the ashes to the\r\nwinds, because they believed that the ashes were changed into rain,\r\nwhich the dead man sent in return for his obsequies. The Chinese are\r\nconvinced that when human bodies remain unburied, the souls of their\r\nlate owners feel the discomfort of rain, just as living men would do\r\nif they were exposed without shelter to the inclemency of the\r\nweather. These wretched souls, therefore, do all in their power to\r\nprevent the rain from falling, and often their efforts are only too\r\nsuccessful. Then drought ensues, the most dreaded of all calamities\r\nin China, because bad harvests, dearth, and famine follow in its\r\ntrain. Hence it has been a common practice of the Chinese\r\nauthorities in time of drought to inter the dry bones of the\r\nunburied dead for the purpose of putting an end to the scourge and\r\nconjuring down the rain.\r\n\r\nAnimals, again, often play an important part in these\r\nweather-charms. The Anula tribe of Northern Australia associate the\r\ndollar-bird with rain, and call it the rain-bird. A man who has the\r\nbird for his totem can make rain at a certain pool. He catches a\r\nsnake, puts it alive into the pool, and after holding it under water\r\nfor a time takes it out, kills it, and lays it down by the side of\r\nthe creek. Then he makes an arched bundle of grass stalks in\r\nimitation of a rainbow, and sets it up over the snake. After that\r\nall he does is to sing over the snake and the mimic rainbow; sooner\r\nor later the rain will fall. They explain this procedure by saying\r\nthat long ago the dollar-bird had as a mate at this spot a snake,\r\nwho lived in the pool and used to make rain by spitting up into the\r\nsky till a rainbow and clouds appeared and rain fell. A common way\r\nof making rain in many parts of Java is to bathe a cat or two cats,\r\na male and a female; sometimes the animals are carried in procession\r\nwith music. Even in Batavia you may from time to time see children\r\ngoing about with a cat for this purpose; when they have ducked it in\r\na pool, they let it go.\r\n\r\nAmong the Wambugwe of East Africa, when the sorcerer desires to make\r\nrain, he takes a black sheep and a black calf in bright sunshine,\r\nand has them placed on the roof of the common hut in which the\r\npeople live together. Then he slits the stomachs of the animals and\r\nscatters their contents in all directions. After that he pours water\r\nand medicine into a vessel; if the charm has succeeded, the water\r\nboils up and rain follows. On the other hand, if the sorcerer wishes\r\nto prevent rain from falling, he withdraws into the interior of the\r\nhut, and there heats a rock-crystal in a calabash. In order to\r\nprocure rain the Wagogo sacrifice black fowls, black sheep, and\r\nblack cattle at the graves of dead ancestors, and the rain-maker\r\nwears black clothes during the rainy season. Among the Matabele the\r\nrain-charm employed by sorcerers was made from the blood and gall of\r\na black ox. In a district of Sumatra, in order to procure rain, all\r\nthe women of the village, scantily clad, go to the river, wade into\r\nit, and splash each other with the water. A black cat is thrown into\r\nthe stream and made to swim about for a while, then allowed to\r\nescape to the bank, pursued by the splashing of the women. The Garos\r\nof Assam offer a black goat on the top of a very high mountain in\r\ntime of drought. In all these cases the colour of the animal is part\r\nof the charm; being black, it will darken the sky with rain-clouds.\r\nSo the Bechuanas burn the stomach of an ox at evening, because they\r\nsay, "The black smoke will gather the clouds and cause the rain to\r\ncome." The Timorese sacrifice a black pig to the Earth-goddess for\r\nrain, a white or red one to the Sun-god for sunshine. The Angoni\r\nsacrifice a black ox for rain and a white one for fine weather.\r\nAmong the high mountains of Japan there is a district in which, if\r\nrain has not fallen for a long time, a party of villagers goes in\r\nprocession to the bed of a mountain torrent, headed by a priest, who\r\nleads a black dog. At the chosen spot they tether the beast to a\r\nstone, and make it a target for their bullets and arrows. When its\r\nlife-blood bespatters the rocks, the peasants throw down their\r\nweapons and lift up their voices in supplication to the dragon\r\ndivinity of the stream, exhorting him to send down forthwith a\r\nshower to cleanse the spot from its defilement. Custom has\r\nprescribed that on these occasions the colour of the victim shall be\r\nblack, as an emblem of the wished-for rain-clouds. But if fine\r\nweather is wanted, the victim must be white, without a spot.\r\n\r\nThe intimate association of frogs and toads with water has earned\r\nfor these creatures a widespread reputation as custodians of rain;\r\nand hence they often play a part in charms designed to draw needed\r\nshowers from the sky. Some of the Indians of the Orinoco held the\r\ntoad to be the god or lord of the waters, and for that reason feared\r\nto kill the creature. They have been known to keep frogs under a pot\r\nand to beat them with rods when there was a drought. It is said that\r\nthe Aymara Indians often make little images of frogs and other\r\naquatic animals and place them on the tops of the hills as a means\r\nof bringing down rain. The Thompson Indians of British Columbia and\r\nsome people in Europe think that to kill a frog will cause rain to\r\nfall. In order to procure rain people of low caste in the Central\r\nProvinces of India will tie a frog to a rod covered with green\r\nleaves and branches of the _n\xeem_ tree (_Azadirachta Indica_) and\r\ncarry it from door to door singing:\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Send soon, O frog, the jewel of water!\r\n     And ripen the wheat and millet in the field."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kapus or Reddis are a large caste of cultivators and landowners\r\nin the Madras Presidency. When rain fails, women of the caste will\r\ncatch a frog and tie it alive to a new winnowing fan made of bamboo.\r\nOn this fan they spread a few margosa leaves and go from door to\r\ndoor singing, "Lady frog must have her bath. Oh! rain-god, give a\r\nlittle water for her at least." While the Kapu women sing this song,\r\nthe woman of the house pours water over the frog and gives an alms,\r\nconvinced that by so doing she will soon bring rain down in\r\ntorrents.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when a drought has lasted a long time, people drop the\r\nusual hocus-pocus of imitative magic altogether, and being far too\r\nangry to waste their breath in prayer they seek by threats and\r\ncurses or even downright physical force to extort the waters of\r\nheaven from the supernatural being who has, so to say, cut them off\r\nat the main. In a Japanese village, when the guardian divinity had\r\nlong been deaf to the peasants\' prayers for rain, they at last threw\r\ndown his image and, with curses loud and long, hurled it head\r\nforemost into a stinking rice-field. "There," they said, "you may\r\nstay yourself for a while, to see how _you_ will feel after a few\r\ndays\' scorching in this broiling sun that is burning the life from\r\nour cracking fields." In the like circumstances the Feloupes of\r\nSenegambia cast down their fetishes and drag them about the fields,\r\ncursing them till rain falls.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese are adepts in the art of taking the kingdom of heaven by\r\nstorm. Thus, when rain is wanted they make a huge dragon of paper or\r\nwood to represent the rain-god, and carry it about in procession;\r\nbut if no rain follows, the mock-dragon is execrated and torn to\r\npieces. At other times they threaten and beat the god if he does not\r\ngive rain; sometimes they publicly depose him from the rank of\r\ndeity. On the other hand, if the wished-for rain falls, the god is\r\npromoted to a higher rank by an imperial decree. In April 1888 the\r\nmandarins of Canton prayed to the god Lung-wong to stop the\r\nincessant downpour of rain; and when he turned a deaf ear to their\r\npetitions they put him in a lock-up for five days. This had a\r\nsalutary effect. The rain ceased and the god was restored to\r\nliberty. Some years before, in time of drought, the same deity had\r\nbeen chained and exposed to the sun for days in the courtyard of his\r\ntemple in order that he might feel for himself the urgent need of\r\nrain. So when the Siamese need rain, they set out their idols in the\r\nblazing sun; but if they want dry weather, they unroof the temples\r\nand let the rain pour down on the idols. They think that the\r\ninconvenience to which the gods are thus subjected will induce them\r\nto grant the wishes of their worshippers.\r\n\r\nThe reader may smile at the meteorology of the Far East; but\r\nprecisely similar modes of procuring rain have been resorted to in\r\nChristian Europe within our own lifetime. By the end of April 1893\r\nthere was great distress in Sicily for lack of water. The drought\r\nhad lasted six months. Every day the sun rose and set in a sky of\r\ncloudless blue. The gardens of the Conca d\'Oro, which surround\r\nPalermo with a magnificent belt of verdure, were withering. Food was\r\nbecoming scarce. The people were in great alarm. All the most\r\napproved methods of procuring rain had been tried without effect.\r\nProcessions had traversed the streets and the fields. Men, women,\r\nand children, telling their beads, had lain whole nights before the\r\nholy images. Consecrated candles had burned day and night in the\r\nchurches. Palm branches, blessed on Palm Sunday, had been hung on\r\nthe trees. At Solaparuta, in accordance with a very old custom, the\r\ndust swept from the churches on Palm Sunday had been spread on the\r\nfields. In ordinary years these holy sweepings preserve the crops;\r\nbut that year, if you will believe me, they had no effect whatever.\r\nAt Nicosia the inhabitants, bare-headed and bare-foot, carried the\r\ncrucifixes through all the wards of the town and scourged each other\r\nwith iron whips. It was all in vain. Even the great St. Francis of\r\nPaolo himself, who annually performs the miracle of rain and is\r\ncarried every spring through the market-gardens, either could not or\r\nwould not help. Masses, vespers, concerts, illuminations,\r\nfire-works--nothing could move him. At last the peasants began to\r\nlose patience. Most of the saints were banished. At Palermo they\r\ndumped St. Joseph in a garden to see the state of things for\r\nhimself, and they swore to leave him there in the sun till rain\r\nfell. Other saints were turned, like naughty children, with their\r\nfaces to the wall. Others again, stripped of their beautiful robes,\r\nwere exiled far from their parishes, threatened, grossly insulted,\r\nducked in horse-ponds. At Caltanisetta the golden wings of St.\r\nMichael the Archangel were torn from his shoulders and replaced with\r\nwings of pasteboard; his purple mantle was taken away and a clout\r\nwrapt about him instead. At Licata the patron saint, St. Angelo,\r\nfared even worse, for he was left without any garments at all; he\r\nwas reviled, he was put in irons, he was threatened with drowning or\r\nhanging. "Rain or the rope!" roared the angry people at him, as they\r\nshook their fists in his face.\r\n\r\nSometimes an appeal is made to the pity of the gods. When their corn\r\nis being burnt up by the sun, the Zulus look out for a "heaven\r\nbird," kill it, and throw it into a pool. Then the heaven melts with\r\ntenderness for the death of the bird; "it wails for it by raining,\r\nwailing a funeral wail." In Zululand women sometimes bury their\r\nchildren up to the neck in the ground, and then retiring to a\r\ndistance keep up a dismal howl for a long time. The sky is supposed\r\nto melt with pity at the sight. Then the women dig the children out\r\nand feel sure that rain will soon follow. They say that they call to\r\n"the lord above" and ask him to send rain. If it comes they declare\r\nthat "Usondo rains." In times of drought the Guanches of Teneriffe\r\nled their sheep to sacred ground, and there they separated the lambs\r\nfrom their dams, that their plaintive bleating might touch the heart\r\nof the god. In Kumaon a way of stopping rain is to pour hot oil in\r\nthe left ear of a dog. The animal howls with pain, his howls are\r\nheard by Indra, and out of pity for the beast\'s sufferings the god\r\nstops the rain. Sometimes the Toradjas attempt to procure rain as\r\nfollows. They place the stalks of certain plants in water, saying,\r\n"Go and ask for rain, and so long as no rain falls I will not plant\r\nyou again, but there shall you die." Also they string some\r\nfresh-water snails on a cord, and hang the cord on a tree, and say\r\nto the snails, "Go and ask for rain, and so long as no rain comes, I\r\nwill not take you back to the water." Then the snails go and weep,\r\nand the gods take pity and send rain. However, the foregoing\r\nceremonies are religious rather than magical, since they involve an\r\nappeal to the compassion of higher powers.\r\n\r\nStones are often supposed to possess the property of bringing on\r\nrain, provided they be dipped in water or sprinkled with it, or\r\ntreated in some other appropriate manner. In a Samoan village a\r\ncertain stone was carefully housed as the representative of the\r\nrain-making god, and in time of drought his priests carried the\r\nstone in procession and dipped it in a stream. Among the Ta-ta-thi\r\ntribe of New South Wales, the rain-maker breaks off a piece of\r\nquartz-crystal and spits it towards the sky; the rest of the crystal\r\nhe wraps in emu feathers, soaks both crystal and feathers in water,\r\nand carefully hides them. In the Keramin tribe of New South Wales\r\nthe wizard retires to the bed of a creek, drops water on a round\r\nflat stone, then covers up and conceals it. Among some tribes of\r\nNorth-western Australia the rain-maker repairs to a piece of ground\r\nwhich is set apart for the purpose of rain-making. There he builds a\r\nheap of stones or sand, places on the top of it his magic stone, and\r\nwalks or dances round the pile chanting his incantations for hours,\r\ntill sheer exhaustion obliges him to desist, when his place is taken\r\nby his assistant. Water is sprinkled on the stone and huge fires are\r\nkindled. No layman may approach the sacred spot while the mystic\r\nceremony is being performed. When the Sulka of New Britain wish to\r\nprocure rain they blacken stones with the ashes of certain fruits\r\nand set them out, along with certain other plants and buds, in the\r\nsun. Then a handful of twigs is dipped in water and weighted with\r\nstones, while a spell is chanted. After that rain should follow. In\r\nManipur, on a lofty hill to the east of the capital, there is a\r\nstone which the popular imagination likens to an umbrella. When rain\r\nis wanted, the rajah fetches water from a spring below and sprinkles\r\nit on the stone. At Sagami in Japan there is a stone which draws\r\ndown rain whenever water is poured on it. When the Wakondyo, a tribe\r\nof Central Africa, desire rain, they send to the Wawamba, who dwell\r\nat the foot of snowy mountains, and are the happy possessors of a\r\n"rain-stone." In consideration of a proper payment, the Wawamba wash\r\nthe precious stone, anoint it with oil, and put it in a pot full of\r\nwater. After that the rain cannot fail to come. In the arid wastes\r\nof Arizona and New Mexico the Apaches sought to make rain by\r\ncarrying water from a certain spring and throwing it on a particular\r\npoint high up on a rock; after that they imagined that the clouds\r\nwould soon gather, and that rain would begin to fall.\r\n\r\nBut customs of this sort are not confined to the wilds of Africa and\r\nAsia or the torrid deserts of Australia and the New World. They have\r\nbeen practised in the cool air and under the grey skies of Europe.\r\nThere is a fountain called Barenton, of romantic fame, in those\r\n"wild woods of Broceliande," where, if legend be true, the wizard\r\nMerlin still sleeps his magic slumber in the hawthorn shade. Thither\r\nthe Breton peasants used to resort when they needed rain. They\r\ncaught some of the water in a tankard and threw it on a slab near\r\nthe spring. On Snowdon there is a lonely tarn called Dulyn, or the\r\nBlack Lake, lying "in a dismal dingle surrounded by high and\r\ndangerous rocks." A row of stepping-stones runs out into the lake,\r\nand if any one steps on the stones and throws water so as to wet the\r\nfarthest stone, which is called the Red Altar, "it is but a chance\r\nthat you do not get rain before night, even when it is hot weather."\r\nIn these cases it appears probable that, as in Samoa, the stone is\r\nregarded as more or less divine. This appears from the custom\r\nsometimes observed of dipping a cross in the Fountain of Barenton to\r\nprocure rain, for this is plainly a Christian substitute for the old\r\npagan way of throwing water on the stone. At various places in\r\nFrance it is, or used till lately to be, the practice to dip the\r\nimage of a saint in water as a means of procuring rain. Thus, beside\r\nthe old priory of Commagny, there is a spring of St. Gervais,\r\nwhither the inhabitants go in procession to obtain rain or fine\r\nweather according to the needs of the crops. In times of great\r\ndrought they throw into the basin of the fountain an ancient stone\r\nimage of the saint that stands in a sort of niche from which the\r\nfountain flows. At Collobri\xe8res and Carpentras a similar practice\r\nwas observed with the images of St. Pons and St. Gens respectively.\r\nIn several villages of Navarre prayers for rain used to be offered\r\nto St. Peter, and by way of enforcing them the villagers carried the\r\nimage of the saint in procession to the river, where they thrice\r\ninvited him to reconsider his resolution and to grant their prayers;\r\nthen, if he was still obstinate, they plunged him in the water,\r\ndespite the remonstrances of the clergy, who pleaded with as much\r\ntruth as piety that a simple caution or admonition administered to\r\nthe image would produce an equally good effect. After this the rain\r\nwas sure to fall within twenty-four hours. Catholic countries do not\r\nenjoy a monopoly of making rain by ducking holy images in water. In\r\nMingrelia, when the crops are suffering from want of rain, they take\r\na particularly holy image and dip it in water every day till a\r\nshower falls; and in the Far East the Shans drench the images of\r\nBuddha with water when the rice is perishing of drought. In all such\r\ncases the practice is probably at bottom a sympathetic charm,\r\nhowever it may be disguised under the appearance of a punishment or\r\na threat.\r\n\r\nLike other peoples, the Greeks and Romans sought to obtain rain by\r\nmagic, when prayers and processions had proved ineffectual. For\r\nexample, in Arcadia, when the corn and trees were parched with\r\ndrought, the priest of Zeus dipped an oak branch into a certain\r\nspring on Mount Lycaeus. Thus troubled, the water sent up a misty\r\ncloud, from which rain soon fell upon the land. A similar mode of\r\nmaking rain is still practised, as we have seen, in Halmahera near\r\nNew Guinea. The people of Crannon in Thessaly had a bronze chariot\r\nwhich they kept in a temple. When they desired a shower they shook\r\nthe chariot and the shower fell. Probably the rattling of the\r\nchariot was meant to imitate thunder; we have already seen that mock\r\nthunder and lightning form part of a rain-charm in Russia and Japan.\r\nThe legendary Salmoneus, King of Elis, made mock thunder by dragging\r\nbronze kettles behind his chariot, or by driving over a bronze\r\nbridge, while he hurled blazing torches in imitation of lightning.\r\nIt was his impious wish to mimic the thundering car of Zeus as it\r\nrolled across the vault of heaven. Indeed he declared that he was\r\nactually Zeus, and caused sacrifices to be offered to himself as\r\nsuch. Near a temple of Mars, outside the walls of Rome, there was\r\nkept a certain stone known as the _lapis manalis._ In time of\r\ndrought the stone was dragged into Rome, and this was supposed to\r\nbring down rain immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The Magical Control of the Sun\r\n\r\nAS THE MAGICIAN thinks he can make rain, so he fancies he can cause\r\nthe sun to shine, and can hasten or stay its going down. At an\r\neclipse the Ojebways used to imagine that the sun was being\r\nextinguished. So they shot fire-tipped arrows in the air, hoping\r\nthus to rekindle his expiring light. The Sencis of Peru also shot\r\nburning arrows at the sun during an eclipse, but apparently they did\r\nthis not so much to relight his lamp as to drive away a savage beast\r\nwith which they supposed him to be struggling. Conversely during an\r\neclipse of the moon some tribes of the Orinoco used to bury lighted\r\nbrands in the ground; because, said they, if the moon were to be\r\nextinguished, all fire on earth would be extinguished with her,\r\nexcept such as was hidden from her sight. During an eclipse of the\r\nsun the Kamtchatkans were wont to bring out fire from their huts and\r\npray the great luminary to shine as before. But the prayer addressed\r\nto the sun shows that this ceremony was religious rather than\r\nmagical. Purely magical, on the other hand, was the ceremony\r\nobserved on similar occasions by the Chilcotin Indians. Men and\r\nwomen tucked up their robes, as they do in travelling, and then\r\nleaning on staves, as if they were heavy laden, they continued to\r\nwalk in a circle till the eclipse was over. Apparently they thought\r\nthus to support the failing steps of the sun as he trod his weary\r\nround in the sky. Similarly in ancient Egypt the king, as the\r\nrepresentative of the sun, walked solemnly round the walls of a\r\ntemple in order to ensure that the sun should perform his daily\r\njourney round the sky without the interruption of an eclipse or\r\nother mishap. And after the autumnal equinox the ancient Egyptians\r\nheld a festival called "the nativity of the sun\'s walking-stick,"\r\nbecause, as the luminary declined daily in the sky, and his light\r\nand heat diminished, he was supposed to need a staff on which to\r\nlean. In New Caledonia when a wizard desires to make sunshine, he\r\ntakes some plants and corals to the burial-ground, and fashions them\r\ninto a bundle, adding two locks of hair cut from a living child of\r\nhis family, also two teeth or an entire jawbone from the skeleton of\r\nan ancestor. He then climbs a mountain whose top catches the first\r\nrays of the morning sun. Here he deposits three sorts of plants on a\r\nflat stone, places a branch of dry coral beside them, and hangs the\r\nbundle of charms over the stone. Next morning he returns to the spot\r\nand sets fire to the bundle at the moment when the sun rises from\r\nthe sea. As the smoke curls up, he rubs the stone with the dry\r\ncoral, invokes his ancestors and says: "Sun! I do this that you may\r\nbe burning hot, and eat up all the clouds in the sky." The same\r\nceremony is repeated at sunset. The New Caledonians also make a\r\ndrought by means of a disc-shaped stone with a hole in it. At the\r\nmoment when the sun rises, the wizard holds the stone in his hand\r\nand passes a burning brand repeatedly into the hole, while he says:\r\n"I kindle the sun, in order that he may eat up the clouds and dry up\r\nour land, so that it may produce nothing." The Banks Islanders make\r\nsunshine by means of a mock sun. They take a very round stone,\r\ncalled a _vat loa_ or sunstone, wind red braid about it, and stick\r\nit with owls\' feathers to represent rays, singing the proper spell\r\nin a low voice. Then they hang it on some high tree, such as a\r\nbanyan or a casuarina, in a sacred place.\r\n\r\nThe offering made by the Brahman in the morning is supposed to\r\nproduce the sun, and we are told that "assuredly it would not rise,\r\nwere he not to make that offering." The ancient Mexicans conceived\r\nthe sun as the source of all vital force; hence they named him\r\nIpalnemohuani, "He by whom men live." But if he bestowed life on the\r\nworld, he needed also to receive life from it. And as the heart is\r\nthe seat and symbol of life, bleeding hearts of men and animals were\r\npresented to the sun to maintain him in vigour and enable him to run\r\nhis course across the sky. Thus the Mexican sacrifices to the sun\r\nwere magical rather than religious, being designed, not so much to\r\nplease and propitiate him, as physically to renew his energies of\r\nheat, light, and motion. The constant demand for human victims to\r\nfeed the solar fire was met by waging war every year on the\r\nneighbouring tribes and bringing back troops of captives to be\r\nsacrificed on the altar. Thus the ceaseless wars of the Mexicans and\r\ntheir cruel system of human sacrifices, the most monstrous on\r\nrecord, sprang in great measure from a mistaken theory of the solar\r\nsystem. No more striking illustration could be given of the\r\ndisastrous consequences that may flow in practice from a purely\r\nspeculative error. The ancient Greeks believed that the sun drove in\r\na chariot across the sky; hence the Rhodians, who worshipped the sun\r\nas their chief deity, annually dedicated a chariot and four horses\r\nto him, and flung them into the sea for his use. Doubtless they\r\nthought that after a year\'s work his old horses and chariot would be\r\nworn out. From a like motive, probably, the idolatrous kings of\r\nJudah dedicated chariots and horses to the sun, and the Spartans,\r\nPersians, and Massagetae sacrificed horses to him. The Spartans\r\nperformed the sacrifice on the top of Mount Taygetus, the beautiful\r\nrange behind which they saw the great luminary set every night. It\r\nwas as natural for the inhabitants of the valley of Sparta to do\r\nthis as it was for the islanders of Rhodes to throw the chariot and\r\nhorses into the sea, into which the sun seemed to them to sink at\r\nevening. For thus, whether on the mountain or in the sea, the fresh\r\nhorses stood ready for the weary god where they would be most\r\nwelcome, at the end of his day\'s journey.\r\n\r\nAs some people think they can light up the sun or speed him on his\r\nway, so others fancy they can retard or stop him. In a pass of the\r\nPeruvian Andes stand two ruined towers on opposite hills. Iron hooks\r\nare clamped into their walls for the purpose of stretching a net\r\nfrom one tower to the other. The net is intended to catch the sun.\r\nStories of men who have caught the sun in a noose are widely spread.\r\nWhen the sun is going southward in the autumn, and sinking lower and\r\nlower in the Arctic sky, the Esquimaux of Iglulik play the game of\r\ncat\'s cradle in order to catch him in the meshes of the string and\r\nso prevent his disappearance. On the contrary, when the sun is\r\nmoving northward in the spring, they play the game of cup-and-ball\r\nto hasten his return. When an Australian blackfellow wishes to stay\r\nthe sun from going down till he gets home, he puts a sod in the fork\r\nof a tree, exactly facing the setting sun. On the other hand, to\r\nmake it go down faster, the Australians throw sand into the air and\r\nblow with their mouths towards the sun, perhaps to waft the\r\nlingering orb westward and bury it under the sands into which it\r\nappears to sink at night.\r\n\r\nAs some people imagine they can hasten the sun, so others fancy they\r\ncan jog the tardy moon. The natives of New Guinea reckon months by\r\nthe moon, and some of them have been known to throw stones and\r\nspears at the moon, in order to accelerate its progress and so to\r\nhasten the return of their friends, who were away from home for\r\ntwelve months working on a tobacco plantation. The Malays think that\r\na bright glow at sunset may throw a weak person into a fever. Hence\r\nthey attempt to extinguish the glow by spitting out water and\r\nthrowing ashes at it. The Shuswap Indians believe that they can\r\nbring on cold weather by burning the wood of a tree that has been\r\nstruck by lightning. The belief may be based on the observation that\r\nin their country cold follows a thunder-storm. Hence in spring, when\r\nthese Indians are travelling over the snow on high ground, they burn\r\nsplinters of such wood in the fire in order that the crust of the\r\nsnow may not melt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The Magical Control of the Wind\r\n\r\nONCE more, the savage thinks he can make the wind to blow or to be\r\nstill. When the day is hot and a Yakut has a long way to go, he\r\ntakes a stone which he has chanced to find in an animal or fish,\r\nwinds a horse-hair several times round it, and ties it to a stick.\r\nHe then waves the stick about, uttering a spell. Soon a cool breeze\r\nbegins to blow. In order to procure a cool wind for nine days the\r\nstone should first be dipped in the blood of a bird or beast and\r\nthen presented to the sun, while the sorcerer makes three turns\r\ncontrary to the course of the luminary. If a Hottentot desires the\r\nwind to drop, he takes one of his fattest skins and hangs it on the\r\nend of a pole, in the belief that by blowing the skin down the wind\r\nwill lose all its force and must itself fall. Fuegian wizards throw\r\nshells against the wind to make it drop. The natives of the island\r\nof Bibili, off New Guinea, are reputed to make wind by blowing with\r\ntheir mouths. In stormy weather the Bogadjim people say, "The Bibili\r\nfolk are at it again, blowing away." Another way of making wind\r\nwhich is practised in New Guinea is to strike a "wind-stone" lightly\r\nwith a stick; to strike it hard would bring on a hurricane. So in\r\nScotland witches used to raise the wind by dipping a rag in water\r\nand beating it thrice on a stone, saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "I knok this rag upone this stane\r\n    To raise the wind in the divellis name,\r\n    It sall not lye till I please againe."\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Greenland a woman in child-bed and for some time after delivery\r\nis supposed to possess the power of laying a storm. She has only to\r\ngo out of doors, fill her mouth with air, and coming back into the\r\nhouse blow it out again. In antiquity there was a family at Corinth\r\nwhich enjoyed the reputation of being able to still the raging wind;\r\nbut we do not know in what manner its members exercised a useful\r\nfunction, which probably earned for them a more solid recompense\r\nthan mere repute among the seafaring population of the isthmus. Even\r\nin Christian times, under the reign of Constantine, a certain\r\nSopater suffered death at Constantinople on a charge of binding the\r\nwinds by magic, because it happened that the corn-ships of Egypt and\r\nSyria were detained afar off by calms or head-winds, to the rage and\r\ndisappointment of the hungry Byzantine rabble. Finnish wizards used\r\nto sell wind to storm-stayed mariners. The wind was enclosed in\r\nthree knots; if they undid the first knot, a moderate wind sprang\r\nup; if the second, it blew half a gale; if the third, a hurricane.\r\nIndeed the Esthonians, whose country is divided from Finland only by\r\nan arm of the sea, still believe in the magical powers of their\r\nnorthern neighbours. The bitter winds that blow in spring from the\r\nnorth and north-east, bringing ague and rheumatic inflammations in\r\ntheir train, are set down by the simple Esthonian peasantry to the\r\nmachinations of the Finnish wizards and witches. In particular they\r\nregard with special dread three days in spring to which they give\r\nthe name of Days of the Cross; one of them falls on the Eve of\r\nAscension Day. The people in the neighbourhood of Fellin fear to go\r\nout on these days lest the cruel winds from Lappland should smite\r\nthem dead. A popular Esthonian song runs:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Wind of the Cross! rushing and mighty!\r\n    Heavy the blow of thy wings sweeping past!\r\n    Wild wailing wind of misfortune and sorrow,\r\n    Wizards of Finland ride by on the blast.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said, too, that sailors, beating up against the wind in the\r\nGulf of Finland, sometimes see a strange sail heave in sight astern\r\nand overhaul them hand over hand. On she comes with a cloud of\r\ncanvas--all her studding-sails out--right in the teeth of the wind,\r\nforging her way through the foaming billows, dashing back the spray\r\nin sheets from her cutwater, every sail swollen to bursting, every\r\nrope strained to cracking. Then the sailors know that she hails from\r\nFinland.\r\n\r\nThe art of tying up the wind in three knots, so that the more knots\r\nare loosed the stronger will blow the wind, has been attributed to\r\nwizards in Lappland and to witches in Shetland, Lewis, and the Isle\r\nof Man. Shetland seamen still buy winds in the shape of knotted\r\nhandkerchiefs or threads from old women who claim to rule the\r\nstorms. There are said to be ancient crones in Lerwick now who live\r\nby selling wind. Ulysses received the winds in a leathern bag from\r\nAeolus, King of the Winds. The Motumotu in New Guinea think that\r\nstorms are sent by an Oiabu sorcerer; for each wind he has a bamboo\r\nwhich he opens at pleasure. On the top of Mount Agu in Togo, a\r\ndistrict of West Africa, resides a fetish called Bagba, who is\r\nsupposed to control the wind and the rain. His priest is said to\r\nkeep the winds shut up in great pots.\r\n\r\nOften the stormy wind is regarded as an evil being who may be\r\nintimidated, driven away, or killed. When storms and bad weather\r\nhave lasted long and food is scarce with the Central Esquimaux, they\r\nendeavour to conjure the tempest by making a long whip of seaweed,\r\narmed with which they go down to the beach and strike out in the\r\ndirection of the wind, crying "_Taba_ (it is enough)!" Once when\r\nnorth-westerly winds had kept the ice long on the coast and food was\r\nbecoming scarce, the Esquimaux performed a ceremony to make a calm.\r\nA fire was kindled on the shore, and the men gathered round it and\r\nchanted. An old man then stepped up to the fire and in a coaxing\r\nvoice invited the demon of the wind to come under the fire and warm\r\nhimself. When he was supposed to have arrived, a vessel of water, to\r\nwhich each man present had contributed, was thrown on the flames by\r\nan old man, and immediately a flight of arrows sped towards the spot\r\nwhere the fire had been. They thought that the demon would not stay\r\nwhere he had been so badly treated. To complete the effect, guns\r\nwere discharged in various directions, and the captain of a European\r\nvessel was invited to fire on the wind with cannon. On the\r\ntwenty-first of February 1883 a similar ceremony was performed by\r\nthe Esquimaux of Point Barrow, Alaska, with the intention of killing\r\nthe spirit of the wind. Women drove the demon from their houses with\r\nclubs and knives, with which they made passes in the air; and the\r\nmen, gathering round a fire, shot him with their rifles and crushed\r\nhim under a heavy stone the moment that steam rose in a cloud from\r\nthe smouldering embers, on which a tub of water had just been\r\nthrown.\r\n\r\nThe Lengua Indians of the Gran Chaco ascribe the rush of a\r\nwhirl-wind to the passage of a spirit and they fling sticks at it to\r\nfrighten it away. When the wind blows down their huts, the Payaguas\r\nof South America snatch up firebrands and run against the wind,\r\nmenacing it with the blazing brands, while others beat the air with\r\ntheir fists to frighten the storm. When the Guaycurus are threatened\r\nby a severe storm, the men go out armed, and the women and children\r\nscream their loudest to intimidate the demon. During a tempest the\r\ninhabitants of a Batak village in Sumatra have been seen to rush\r\nfrom their houses armed with sword and lance. The rajah placed\r\nhimself at their head, and with shouts and yells they hewed and\r\nhacked at the invisible foe. An old woman was observed to be\r\nspecially active in the defence of her house, slashing the air right\r\nand left with a long sabre. In a violent thunderstorm, the peals\r\nsounding very near, the Kayans of Borneo have been seen to draw\r\ntheir swords threateningly half out of their scabbards, as if to\r\nfrighten away the demons of the storm. In Australia the huge columns\r\nof red sand that move rapidly across a desert tract are thought by\r\nthe natives to be spirits passing along. Once an athletic young\r\nblack ran after one of these moving columns to kill it with\r\nboomerangs. He was away two or three hours, and came back very\r\nweary, saying he had killed Koochee (the demon), but that Koochee\r\nhad growled at him and he must die. Of the Bedouins of Eastern\r\nAfrica it is said that "no whirl-wind ever sweeps across the path\r\nwithout being pursued by a dozen savages with drawn creeses, who\r\nstab into the centre of the dusty column in order to drive away the\r\nevil spirit that is believed to be riding on the blast."\r\n\r\nIn the light of these examples a story told by Herodotus, which his\r\nmodern critics have treated as a fable, is perfectly credible. He\r\nsays, without however vouching for the truth of the tale, that once\r\nin the land of the Psylli, the modern Tripoli, the wind blowing from\r\nthe Sahara had dried up all the water-tanks. So the people took\r\ncounsel and marched in a body to make war on the south wind. But\r\nwhen they entered the desert the simoon swept down on them and\r\nburied them to a man. The story may well have been told by one who\r\nwatched them disappearing, in battle array, with drums and cymbals\r\nbeating, into the red cloud of whirling sand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Magicians as Kings\r\n\r\nTHE FOREGOING evidence may satisfy us that in many lands and many\r\nraces magic has claimed to control the great forces of nature for\r\nthe good of man. If that has been so, the practitioners of the art\r\nmust necessarily be personages of importance and influence in any\r\nsociety which puts faith in their extravagant pretensions, and it\r\nwould be no matter for surprise if, by virtue of the reputation\r\nwhich they enjoy and of the awe which they inspire, some of them\r\nshould attain to the highest position of authority over their\r\ncredulous fellows. In point of fact magicians appear to have often\r\ndeveloped into chiefs and kings.\r\n\r\nLet us begin by looking at the lowest race of men as to whom we\r\npossess comparatively full and accurate information, the aborigines\r\nof Australia. These savages are ruled neither by chiefs nor kings.\r\nSo far as their tribes can be said to have a political constitution,\r\nit is a democracy or rather an oligarchy of old and influential men,\r\nwho meet in council and decide on all measures of importance to the\r\npractical exclusion of the younger men. Their deliberative assembly\r\nanswers to the senate of later times: if we had to coin a word for\r\nsuch a government of elders we might call it a _gerontocracy._ The\r\nelders who in aboriginal Australia thus meet and direct the affairs\r\nof their tribe appear to be for the most part the headmen of their\r\nrespective totem clans. Now in Central Australia, where the desert\r\nnature of the country and the almost complete isolation from foreign\r\ninfluences have retarded progress and preserved the natives on the\r\nwhole in their most primitive state, the headmen of the various\r\ntotem clans are charged with the important task of performing\r\nmagical ceremonies for the multiplication of the totems, and as the\r\ngreat majority of the totems are edible animals or plants, it\r\nfollows that these men are commonly expected to provide the people\r\nwith food by means of magic. Others have to make the rain to fall or\r\nto render other services to the community. In short, among the\r\ntribes of Central Australia the headmen are public magicians.\r\nFurther, their most important function is to take charge of the\r\nsacred storehouse, usually a cleft in the rocks or a hole in the\r\nground, where are kept the holy stones and sticks (_churinga_) with\r\nwhich the souls of all the people, both living and dead, are\r\napparently supposed to be in a manner bound up. Thus while the\r\nheadmen have certainly to perform what we should call civil duties,\r\nsuch as to inflict punishment for breaches of tribal custom, their\r\nprincipal functions are sacred or magical.\r\n\r\nWhen we pass from Australia to New Guinea we find that, though the\r\nnatives stand at a far higher level of culture than the Australian\r\naborigines, the constitution of society among them is still\r\nessentially democratic or oligarchic, and chieftainship exists only\r\nin embryo. Thus Sir William MacGregor tells us that in British New\r\nGuinea no one has ever arisen wise enough, bold enough, and strong\r\nenough to become the despot even of a single district. "The nearest\r\napproach to this has been the very distant one of some person\r\nbecoming a renowned wizard; but that has only resulted in levying a\r\ncertain amount of blackmail."\r\n\r\nAccording to a native account, the origin of the power of Melanesian\r\nchiefs lies entirely in the belief that they have communication with\r\nmighty ghosts, and wield that supernatural power whereby they can\r\nbring the influence of the ghosts to bear. If a chief imposed a\r\nfine, it was paid because the people universally dreaded his ghostly\r\npower, and firmly believed that he could inflict calamity and\r\nsickness upon such as resisted him. As soon as any considerable\r\nnumber of his people began to disbelieve in his influence with the\r\nghosts, his power to levy fines was shaken. Again, Dr. George Brown\r\ntells us that in New Britain "a ruling chief was always supposed to\r\nexercise priestly functions, that is, he professed to be in constant\r\ncommunication with the _tebarans_ (spirits), and through their\r\ninfluence he was enabled to bring rain or sunshine, fair winds or\r\nfoul ones, sickness or health, success or disaster in war, and\r\ngenerally to procure any blessing or curse for which the applicant\r\nwas willing to pay a sufficient price."\r\n\r\nStill rising in the scale of culture we come to Africa, where both\r\nthe chieftainship and the kingship are fully developed; and here the\r\nevidence for the evolution of the chief out of the magician, and\r\nespecially out of the rain-maker, is comparatively plentiful. Thus\r\namong the Wambugwe, a Bantu people of East Africa, the original form\r\nof government was a family republic, but the enormous power of the\r\nsorcerers, transmitted by inheritance, soon raised them to the rank\r\nof petty lords or chiefs. Of the three chiefs living in the country\r\nin 1894 two were much dreaded as magicians, and the wealth of cattle\r\nthey possessed came to them almost wholly in the shape of presents\r\nbestowed for their services in that capacity. Their principal art\r\nwas that of rain-making. The chiefs of the Wataturu, another people\r\nof East Africa, are said to be nothing but sorcerers destitute of\r\nany direct political influence. Again, among the Wagogo of East\r\nAfrica the main power of the chiefs, we are told, is derived from\r\ntheir art of rain-making. If a chief cannot make rain himself, he\r\nmust procure it from some one who can.\r\n\r\nAgain, among the tribes of the Upper Nile the medicine-men are\r\ngenerally the chiefs. Their authority rests above all upon their\r\nsupposed power of making rain, for "rain is the one thing which\r\nmatters to the people in those districts, as if it does not come\r\ndown at the right time it means untold hardships for the community.\r\nIt is therefore small wonder that men more cunning than their\r\nfellows should arrogate to themselves the power of producing it, or\r\nthat having gained such a reputation, they should trade on the\r\ncredulity of their simpler neighbours." Hence "most of the chiefs of\r\nthese tribes are rain-makers, and enjoy a popularity in proportion\r\nto their powers to give rain to their people at the proper season. .\r\n. . Rain-making chiefs always build their villages on the slopes of\r\na fairly high hill, as they no doubt know that the hills attract the\r\nclouds, and that they are, therefore, fairly safe in their weather\r\nforecasts." Each of these rain-makers has a number of rain-stones,\r\nsuch as rock-crystal, aventurine, and amethyst, which he keeps in a\r\npot. When he wishes to produce rain he plunges the stones in water,\r\nand taking in his hand a peeled cane, which is split at the top, he\r\nbeckons with it to the clouds to come or waves them away in the way\r\nthey should go, muttering an incantation the while. Or he pours\r\nwater and the entrails of a sheep or goat into a hollow in a stone\r\nand then sprinkles the water towards the sky. Though the chief\r\nacquires wealth by the exercise of his supposed magical powers, he\r\noften, perhaps generally, comes to a violent end; for in time of\r\ndrought the angry people assemble and kill him, believing that it is\r\nhe who prevents the rain from falling. Yet the office is usually\r\nhereditary and passes from father to son. Among the tribes which\r\ncherish these beliefs and observe these customs are the Latuka,\r\nBari, Laluba, and Lokoiya.\r\n\r\nIn Central Africa, again, the Lendu tribe, to the west of Lake\r\nAlbert, firmly believe that certain people possess the power of\r\nmaking rain. Among them the rain-maker either is a chief or almost\r\ninvariably becomes one. The Banyoro also have a great respect for\r\nthe dispensers of rain, whom they load with a profusion of gifts.\r\nThe great dispenser, he who has absolute and uncontrollable power\r\nover the rain, is the king; but he can depute his power to other\r\npersons, so that the benefit may be distributed and the heavenly\r\nwater laid on over the various parts of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn Western as well as in Eastern and Central Africa we meet with the\r\nsame union of chiefly with magical functions. Thus in the Fan tribe\r\nthe strict distinction between chief and medicine-man does not\r\nexist. The chief is also a medicine-man and a smith to boot; for the\r\nFans esteem the smith\'s craft sacred, and none but chiefs may meddle\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nAs to the relation between the offices of chief and rain-maker in\r\nSouth Africa a well-informed writer observes: "In very old days the\r\nchief was the great Rain-maker of the tribe. Some chiefs allowed no\r\none else to compete with them, lest a successful Rain-maker should\r\nbe chosen as chief. There was also another reason: the Rain-maker\r\nwas sure to become a rich man if he gained a great reputation, and\r\nit would manifestly never do for the chief to allow any one to be\r\ntoo rich. The Rain-maker exerts tremendous control over the people,\r\nand so it would be most important to keep this function connected\r\nwith royalty. Tradition always places the power of making rain as\r\nthe fundamental glory of ancient chiefs and heroes, and it seems\r\nprobable that it may have been the origin of chieftainship. The man\r\nwho made the rain would naturally become the chief. In the same way\r\nChaka [the famous Zulu despot] used to declare that he was the only\r\ndiviner in the country, for if he allowed rivals his life would be\r\ninsecure." Similarly speaking of the South African tribes in\r\ngeneral, Dr. Moffat says that "the rain-maker is in the estimation\r\nof the people no mean personage, possessing an influence over the\r\nminds of the people superior even to that of the king, who is\r\nlikewise compelled to yield to the dictates of this arch-official."\r\n\r\nThe foregoing evidence renders it probable that in Africa the king\r\nhas often been developed out of the public magician, and especially\r\nout of the rain-maker. The unbounded fear which the magician\r\ninspires and the wealth which he amasses in the exercise of his\r\nprofession may both be supposed to have contributed to his\r\npromotion. But if the career of a magician and especially of a\r\nrain-maker offers great rewards to the successful practitioner of\r\nthe art, it is beset with many pitfalls into which the unskilful or\r\nunlucky artist may fall. The position of the public sorcerer is\r\nindeed a very precarious one; for where the people firmly believe\r\nthat he has it in his power to make the rain to fall, the sun to\r\nshine, and the fruits of the earth to grow, they naturally impute\r\ndrought and dearth to his culpable negligence or wilful obstinacy,\r\nand they punish him accordingly. Hence in Africa the chief who fails\r\nto procure rain is often exiled or killed. Thus, in some parts of\r\nWest Africa, when prayers and offerings presented to the king have\r\nfailed to procure rain, his subjects bind him with ropes and take\r\nhim by force to the grave of his forefathers that he may obtain from\r\nthem the needed rain. The Banjars in West Africa ascribe to their\r\nking the power of causing rain or fine weather. So long as the\r\nweather is fine they load him with presents of grain and cattle. But\r\nif long drought or rain threatens to spoil the crops, they insult\r\nand beat him till the weather changes. When the harvest fails or the\r\nsurf on the coast is too heavy to allow of fishing, the people of\r\nLoango accuse their king of a "bad heart" and depose him. On the\r\nGrain Coast the high priest or fetish king, who bears the title of\r\nBodio, is responsible for the health of the community, the fertility\r\nof the earth, and the abundance of fish in the sea and rivers; and\r\nif the country suffers in any of these respects the Bodio is deposed\r\nfrom his office. In Ussukuma, a great district on the southern bank\r\nof the Victoria Nyanza, "the rain and locust question is part and\r\nparcel of the Sultan\'s government. He, too, must know how to make\r\nrain and drive away the locusts. If he and his medicine-men are\r\nunable to accomplish this, his whole existence is at stake in times\r\nof distress. On a certain occasion, when the rain so greatly desired\r\nby the people did not come, the Sultan was simply driven out (in\r\nUtutwa, near Nassa). The people, in fact, hold that rulers must have\r\npower over Nature and her phenomena." Again, we are told of the\r\nnatives of the Nyanaza region generally that "they are persuaded\r\nthat rain only falls as a result of magic, and the important duty of\r\ncausing it to descend devolves on the chief of the tribe. If rain\r\ndoes not come at the proper time, everybody complains. More than one\r\npetty king has been banished his country because of drought." Among\r\nthe Latuka of the Upper Nile, when the crops are withering, and all\r\nthe efforts of the chief to draw down rain have proved fruitless,\r\nthe people commonly attack him by night, rob him of all he\r\npossesses, and drive him away. But often they kill him.\r\n\r\nIn many other parts of the world kings have been expected to\r\nregulate the course of nature for the good of their people and have\r\nbeen punished if they failed to do so. It appears that the\r\nScythians, when food was scarce, used to put their king in bonds. In\r\nancient Egypt the sacred kings were blamed for the failure of the\r\ncrops, but the sacred beasts were also held responsible for the\r\ncourse of nature. When pestilence and other calamities had fallen on\r\nthe land, in consequence of a long and severe drought, the priests\r\ntook the animals by night and threatened them, but if the evil did\r\nnot abate they slew the beasts. On the coral island of Niue\xaf or\r\nSavage Island, in the South Pacific, there formerly reigned a line\r\nof kings. But as the kings were also high priests, and were supposed\r\nto make the food grow, the people became angry with them in times of\r\nscarcity and killed them; till at last, as one after another was\r\nkilled, no one would be king, and the monarchy came to an end.\r\nAncient Chinese writers inform us that in Corea the blame was laid\r\non the king whenever too much or too little rain fell and the crops\r\ndid not ripen. Some said that he must be deposed, others that he\r\nmust be slain.\r\n\r\nAmong the American Indians the furthest advance towards civilisation\r\nwas made under the monarchical and theocratic governments of Mexico\r\nand Peru; but we know too little of the early history of these\r\ncountries to say whether the predecessors of their deified kings\r\nwere medicine-men or not. Perhaps a trace of such a succession may\r\nbe detected in the oath which the Mexican kings, when they mounted\r\nthe throne, swore that they would make the sun to shine, the clouds\r\nto give rain, the rivers to flow, and the earth to bring forth\r\nfruits in abundance. Certainly, in aboriginal America the sorcerer\r\nor medicine-man, surrounded by a halo of mystery and an atmosphere\r\nof awe, was a personage of great influence and importance, and he\r\nmay well have developed into a chief or king in many tribes, though\r\npositive evidence of such a development appears to be lacking. Thus\r\nCatlin tells us that in North America the medicine-men "are valued\r\nas dignitaries in the tribe, and the greatest respect is paid to\r\nthem by the whole community; not only for their skill in their\r\n_materia medica,_ but more especially for their tact in magic and\r\nmysteries, in which they all deal to a very great extent. . . . In\r\nall tribes their doctors are conjurers--are magicians--are\r\nsooth-sayers, and I had like to have said high-priests, inasmuch as\r\nthey superintend and conduct all their religious ceremonies; they\r\nare looked upon by all as oracles of the nation. In all councils of\r\nwar and peace, they have a seat with the chiefs, are regularly\r\nconsulted before any public step is taken, and the greatest\r\ndeference and respect is paid to their opinions." Similarly in\r\nCalifornia "the shaman was, and still is, perhaps the most important\r\nindividual among the Maidu. In the absence of any definite system of\r\ngovernment, the word of a shaman has great weight: as a class they\r\nare regarded with much awe, and as a rule are obeyed much more than\r\nthe chief."\r\n\r\nIn South America also the magicians or medicine-men seem to have\r\nbeen on the highroad to chieftainship or kingship. One of the\r\nearliest settlers on the coast of Brazil, the Frenchman Thevet,\r\nreports that the Indians "hold these _pages_ (or medicine-men) in\r\nsuch honour and reverence that they adore, or rather idolise them.\r\nYou may see the common folk go to meet them, prostrate themselves,\r\nand pray to them, saying, \'Grant that I be not ill, that I do not\r\ndie, neither I nor my children,\' or some such request. And he\r\nanswers, \'You shall not die, you shall not be ill,\' and such like\r\nreplies. But sometimes if it happens that these _pages_ do not tell\r\nthe truth, and things turn out otherwise than they predicted, the\r\npeople make no scruple of killing them as unworthy of the title and\r\ndignity of _pages._" Among the Lengua Indians of the Gran Chaco\r\nevery clan has its cazique or chief, but he possesses little\r\nauthority. In virtue of his office he has to make many presents, so\r\nhe seldom grows rich and is generally more shabbily clad than any of\r\nhis subjects. "As a matter of fact the magician is the man who has\r\nmost power in his hands, and he is accustomed to receive presents\r\ninstead of to give them." It is the magician\'s duty to bring down\r\nmisfortune and plagues on the enemies of his tribe, and to guard his\r\nown people against hostile magic. For these services he is well\r\npaid, and by them he acquires a position of great influence and\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Malay region the rajah or king is commonly regarded\r\nwith superstitious veneration as the possessor of supernatural\r\npowers, and there are grounds for thinking that he too, like\r\napparently so many African chiefs, has been developed out of a\r\nsimple magician. At the present day the Malays firmly believe that\r\nthe king possesses a personal influence over the works of nature,\r\nsuch as the growth of the crops and the bearing of fruit-trees. The\r\nsame prolific virtue is supposed to reside, though in a lesser\r\ndegree, in his delegates, and even in the persons of Europeans who\r\nchance to have charge of districts. Thus in Selangor, one of the\r\nnative states of the Malay Peninsula, the success or failure of the\r\nrice-crops is often attributed to a change of district officers. The\r\nToorateyas of Southern Celebes hold that the prosperity of the rice\r\ndepends on the behaviour of their princes, and that bad government,\r\nby which they mean a government which does not conform to ancient\r\ncustom, will result in a failure of the crops.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks of Sarawak believed that their famous English ruler, Rajah\r\nBrooke, was endowed with a certain magical virtue which, if properly\r\napplied, could render the rice-crops abundant. Hence when he visited\r\na tribe, they used to bring him the seed which they intended to sow\r\nnext year, and he fertilised it by shaking over it the women\'s\r\nnecklaces, which had been previously dipped in a special mixture.\r\nAnd when he entered a village, the women would wash and bathe his\r\nfeet, first with water, and then with the milk of a young coco-nut,\r\nand lastly with water again, and all this water which had touched\r\nhis person they preserved for the purpose of distributing it on\r\ntheir farms, believing that it ensured an abundant harvest. Tribes\r\nwhich were too far off for him to visit used to send him a small\r\npiece of white cloth and a little gold or silver, and when these\r\nthings had been impregnated by his generative virtue they buried\r\nthem in their fields, and confidently expected a heavy crop. Once\r\nwhen a European remarked that the rice-crops of the Samban tribe\r\nwere thin, the chief immediately replied that they could not be\r\notherwise, since Rajah Brooke had never visited them, and he begged\r\nthat Mr. Brooke might be induced to visit his tribe and remove the\r\nsterility of their land.\r\n\r\nThe belief that kings possess magical or supernatural powers by\r\nvirtue of which they can fertilise the earth and confer other\r\nbenefits on their subjects would seem to have been shared by the\r\nancestors of all the Aryan races from India to Ireland, and it has\r\nleft clear traces of itself in our own country down to modern times.\r\nThus the ancient Hindoo law-book called _The Laws of Manu_ describes\r\nas follows the effects of a good king\'s reign: "In that country\r\nwhere the king avoids taking the property of mortal sinners, men are\r\nborn in due time and are long-lived. And the crops of the husbandmen\r\nspring up, each as it was sown, and the children die not, and no\r\nmisshaped offspring is born." In Homeric Greece kings and chiefs\r\nwere spoken of as sacred or divine; their houses, too, were divine\r\nand their chariots sacred; and it was thought that the reign of a\r\ngood king caused the black earth to bring forth wheat and barley,\r\nthe trees to be loaded with fruit, the flocks to multiply, and the\r\nsea to yield fish. In the Middle Ages, when Waldemar I., King of\r\nDenmark, travelled in Germany, mothers brought their infants and\r\nhusbandmen their seed for him to lay his hands on, thinking that\r\nchildren would both thrive the better for the royal touch, and for a\r\nlike reason farmers asked him to throw the seed for them. It was the\r\nbelief of the ancient Irish that when their kings observed the\r\ncustoms of their ancestors, the seasons were mild, the crops\r\nplentiful, the cattle fruitful, the waters abounded with fish, and\r\nthe fruit trees had to be propped up on account of the weight of\r\ntheir produce. A canon attributed to St. Patrick enumerates among\r\nthe blessings that attend the reign of a just king "fine weather,\r\ncalm seas, crops abundant, and trees laden with fruit." On the other\r\nhand, dearth, dryness of cows, blight of fruit, and scarcity of corn\r\nwere regarded as infallible proofs that the reigning king was bad.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the last relic of such superstitions which lingered about\r\nour English kings was the notion that they could heal scrofula by\r\ntheir touch. The disease was accordingly known as the King\'s Evil.\r\nQueen Elizabeth often exercised this miraculous gift of healing. On\r\nMidsummer Day 1633, Charles the First cured a hundred patients at\r\none swoop in the chapel royal at Holyrood. But it was under his son\r\nCharles the Second that the practice seems to have attained its\r\nhighest vogue. It is said that in the course of his reign Charles\r\nthe Second touched near a hundred thousand persons for scrofula. The\r\npress to get near him was sometimes terrific. On one occasion six or\r\nseven of those who came to be healed were trampled to death. The\r\ncool-headed William the Third contemptuously refused to lend himself\r\nto the hocuspocus; and when his palace was besieged by the usual\r\nunsavoury crowd, he ordered them to be turned away with a dole. On\r\nthe only occasion when he was importuned into laying his hand on a\r\npatient, he said to him, "God give you better health and more\r\nsense." However, the practice was continued, as might have been\r\nexpected, by the dull bigot James the Second and his dull daughter\r\nQueen Anne.\r\n\r\nThe kings of France also claimed to possess the same gift of healing\r\nby touch, which they are said to have derived from Clovis or from\r\nSt. Louis, while our English kings inherited it from Edward the\r\nConfessor. Similarly the savage chiefs of Tonga were believed to\r\nheal scrofula and cases of indurated liver by the touch of their\r\nfeet; and the cure was strictly homoeopathic, for the disease as\r\nwell as the cure was thought to be caused by contact with the royal\r\nperson or with anything that belonged to it.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, we seem to be justified in inferring that in\r\nmany parts of the world the king is the lineal successor of the old\r\nmagician or medicine-man. When once a special class of sorcerers has\r\nbeen segregated from the community and entrusted by it with the\r\ndischarge of duties on which the public safety and welfare are\r\nbelieved to depend, these men gradually rise to wealth and power,\r\ntill their leaders blossom out into sacred kings. But the great\r\nsocial revolution which thus begins with democracy and ends in\r\ndespotism is attended by an intellectual revolution which affects\r\nboth the conception and the functions of royalty. For as time goes\r\non, the fallacy of magic becomes more and more apparent to the\r\nacuter minds and is slowly displaced by religion; in other words,\r\nthe magician gives way to the priest, who, renouncing the attempt to\r\ncontrol directly the processes of nature for the good of man, seeks\r\nto attain the same end indirectly by appealing to the gods to do for\r\nhim what he no longer fancies he can do for himself. Hence the king,\r\nstarting as a magician, tends gradually to exchange the practice of\r\nmagic for the priestly functions of prayer and sacrifice. And while\r\nthe distinction between the human and the divine is still\r\nimperfectly drawn, it is often imagined that men may themselves\r\nattain to godhead, not merely after their death, but in their\r\nlifetime, through the temporary or permanent possession of their\r\nwhole nature by a great and powerful spirit. No class of the\r\ncommunity has benefited so much as kings by this belief in the\r\npossible incarnation of a god in human form. The doctrine of that\r\nincarnation, and with it the theory of the divinity of kings in the\r\nstrict sense of the word, will form the subject of the following\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Incarnate Human Gods\r\n\r\nTHE INSTANCES which in the preceding chapters I have drawn from the\r\nbeliefs and practices of rude peoples all over the world, may\r\nsuffice to prove that the savage fails to recognise those\r\nlimitations to his power over nature which seem so obvious to us. In\r\na society where every man is supposed to be endowed more or less\r\nwith powers which we should call supernatural, it is plain that the\r\ndistinction between gods and men is somewhat blurred, or rather has\r\nscarcely emerged. The conception of gods as superhuman beings\r\nendowed with powers to which man possesses nothing comparable in\r\ndegree and hardly even in kind, has been slowly evolved in the\r\ncourse of history. By primitive peoples the supernatural agents are\r\nnot regarded as greatly, if at all, superior to man; for they may be\r\nfrightened and coerced by him into doing his will. At this stage of\r\nthought the world is viewed as a great democracy; all beings in it,\r\nwhether natural or supernatural, are supposed to stand on a footing\r\nof tolerable equality. But with the growth of his knowledge man\r\nlearns to realise more clearly the vastness of nature and his own\r\nlittleness and feebleness in presence of it. The recognition of his\r\nhelplessness does not, however, carry with it a corresponding belief\r\nin the impotence of those supernatural beings with which his\r\nimagination peoples the universe. On the contrary, it enhances his\r\nconception of their power. For the idea of the world as a system of\r\nimpersonal forces acting in accordance with fixed and invariable\r\nlaws has not yet fully dawned or darkened upon him. The germ of the\r\nidea he certainly has, and he acts upon it, not only in magic art,\r\nbut in much of the business of daily life. But the idea remains\r\nundeveloped, and so far as he attempts to explain the world he lives\r\nin, he pictures it as the manifestation of conscious will and\r\npersonal agency. If then he feels himself to be so frail and slight,\r\nhow vast and powerful must he deem the beings who control the\r\ngigantic machinery of nature! Thus as his old sense of equality with\r\nthe gods slowly vanishes, he resigns at the same time the hope of\r\ndirecting the course of nature by his own unaided resources, that\r\nis, by magic, and looks more and more to the gods as the sole\r\nrepositories of those supernatural powers which he once claimed to\r\nshare with them. With the advance of knowledge, therefore, prayer\r\nand sacrifice assume the leading place in religious ritual; and\r\nmagic, which once ranked with them as a legitimate equal, is\r\ngradually relegated to the background and sinks to the level of a\r\nblack art. It is not regarded as an encroachment, at once vain and\r\nimpious, on the domain of the gods, and as such encounters the\r\nsteady opposition of the priests, whose reputation and influence\r\nrise or fall with those of their gods. Hence, when at a late period\r\nthe distinction between religion and superstition has emerged, we\r\nfind that sacrifice and prayer are the resource of the pious and\r\nenlightened portion of the community, while magic is the refuge of\r\nthe superstitious and ignorant. But when, still later, the\r\nconception of the elemental forces as personal agents is giving way\r\nto the recognition of natural law; then magic, based as it\r\nimplicitly is on the idea of a necessary and invariable sequence of\r\ncause and effect, independent of personal will, reappears from the\r\nobscurity and discredit into which it had fallen, and by\r\ninvestigating the causal sequences in nature, directly prepares the\r\nway for science. Alchemy leads up to chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe notion of a man-god, or of a human being endowed with divine or\r\nsupernatural powers, belongs essentially to that earlier period of\r\nreligious history in which gods and men are still viewed as beings\r\nof much the same order, and before they are divided by the\r\nimpassable gulf which, to later thought, opens out between them.\r\nStrange, therefore, as may seem to us the idea of a god incarnate in\r\nhuman form, it has nothing very startling for early man, who sees in\r\na man-god or a god-man only a higher degree of the same supernatural\r\npowers which he arrogates in perfect good faith to himself. Nor does\r\nhe draw any very sharp distinction between a god and a powerful\r\nsorcerer. His gods are often merely invisible magicians who behind\r\nthe veil of nature work the same sort of charms and incantations\r\nwhich the human magician works in a visible and bodily form among\r\nhis fellows. And as the gods are commonly believed to exhibit\r\nthemselves in the likeness of men to their worshippers, it is easy\r\nfor the magician, with his supposed miraculous powers, to acquire\r\nthe reputation of being an incarnate deity. Thus beginning as little\r\nmore than a simple conjurer, the medicine-man or magician tends to\r\nblossom out into a full-blown god and king in one. Only in speaking\r\nof him as a god we must beware of importing into the savage\r\nconception of deity those very abstract and complex ideas which we\r\nattach to the term. Our ideas on this profound subject are the fruit\r\nof a long intellectual and moral evolution, and they are so far from\r\nbeing shared by the savage that he cannot even understand them when\r\nthey are explained to him. Much of the controversy which has raged\r\nas to the religion of the lower races has sprung merely from a\r\nmutual misunderstanding. The savage does not understand the thoughts\r\nof the civilised man, and few civilised men understand the thoughts\r\nof the savage. When the savage uses his word for god, he has in his\r\nmind a being of a certain sort: when the civilised man uses his word\r\nfor god, he has in his mind a being of a very different sort; and\r\nif, as commonly happens, the two men are equally unable to place\r\nthemselves at the other\'s point of view, nothing but confusion and\r\nmistakes can result from their discussions. If we civilised men\r\ninsist on limiting the name of God to that particular conception of\r\nthe divine nature which we ourselves have formed, then we must\r\nconfess that the savage has no god at all. But we shall adhere more\r\nclosely to the facts of history if we allow most of the higher\r\nsavages at least to possess a rudimentary notion of certain\r\nsupernatural beings who may fittingly be called gods, though not in\r\nthe full sense in which we use the word. That rudimentary notion\r\nrepresents in all probability the germ out of which the civilised\r\npeoples have gradually evolved their own high conceptions of deity;\r\nand if we could trace the whole course of religious development, we\r\nmight find that the chain which links our idea of the Godhead with\r\nthat of the savage is one and unbroken.\r\n\r\nWith these explanations and cautions I will now adduce some examples\r\nof gods who have been believed by their worshippers to be incarnate\r\nin living human beings, whether men or women. The persons in whom a\r\ndeity is thought to reveal himself are by no means always kings or\r\ndescendants of kings; the supposed incarnation may take place even\r\nin men of the humblest rank. In India, for example, one human god\r\nstarted in life as a cotton-bleacher and another as the son of a\r\ncarpenter. I shall therefore not draw my examples exclusively from\r\nroyal personages, as I wish to illustrate the general principle of\r\nthe deification of living men, in other words, the incarnation of a\r\ndeity in human form. Such incarnate gods are common in rude society.\r\nThe incarnation may be temporary or permanent. In the former case,\r\nthe incarnation--commonly known as inspiration or\r\npossession--reveals itself in supernatural knowledge rather than in\r\nsupernatural power. In other words, its usual manifestations are\r\ndivination and prophecy rather than miracles. On the other hand,\r\nwhen the incarnation is not merely temporary, when the divine spirit\r\nhas permanently taken up its abode in a human body, the god-man is\r\nusually expected to vindicate his character by working miracles.\r\nOnly we have to remember that by men at this stage of thought\r\nmiracles are not considered as breaches of natural law. Not\r\nconceiving the existence of natural law, primitive man cannot\r\nconceive a breach of it. A miracle is to him merely an unusually\r\nstriking manifestation of a common power.\r\n\r\nThe belief in temporary incarnation or inspiration is world-wide.\r\nCertain persons are supposed to be possessed from time to time by a\r\nspirit or deity; while the possession lasts, their own personality\r\nlies in abeyance, the presence of the spirit is revealed by\r\nconvulsive shiverings and shakings of the man\'s whole body, by wild\r\ngestures and excited looks, all of which are referred, not to the\r\nman himself, but to the spirit which has entered into him; and in\r\nthis abnormal state all his utterances are accepted as the voice of\r\nthe god or spirit dwelling in him and speaking through him. Thus,\r\nfor example, in the Sandwich Islands, the king, personating the god,\r\nuttered the responses of the oracle from his concealment in a frame\r\nof wicker-work. But in the southern islands of the Pacific the god\r\n"frequently entered the priest, who, inflated as it were with the\r\ndivinity, ceased to act or speak as a voluntary agent, but moved and\r\nspoke as entirely under supernatural influence. In this respect\r\nthere was a striking resemblance between the rude oracles of the\r\nPolynesians, and those of the celebrated nations of ancient Greece.\r\nAs soon as the god was supposed to have entered the priest, the\r\nlatter became violently agitated, and worked himself up to the\r\nhighest pitch of apparent frenzy, the muscles of the limbs seemed\r\nconvulsed, the body swelled, the countenance became terrific, the\r\nfeatures distorted, and the eyes wild and strained. In this state he\r\noften rolled on the earth, foaming at the mouth, as if labouring\r\nunder the influence of the divinity by whom he was possessed, and,\r\nin shrill cries, and violent and often indistinct sounds, revealed\r\nthe will of the god. The priests, who were attending, and versed in\r\nthe mysteries, received, and reported to the people, the\r\ndeclarations which had been thus received. When the priest had\r\nuttered the response of the oracle, the violent paroxysm gradually\r\nsubsided, and comparative composure ensued. The god did not,\r\nhowever, always leave him as soon as the communication had been\r\nmade. Sometimes the same _taura,_ or priest, continued for two or\r\nthree days possessed by the spirit or deity; a piece of a native\r\ncloth, of a peculiar kind, worn round one arm, was an indication of\r\ninspiration, or of the indwelling of the god with the individual who\r\nwore it. The acts of the man during this period were considered as\r\nthose of the god, and hence the greatest attention was paid to his\r\nexpressions, and the whole of his deportment. . . . When _uruhia_\r\n(under the inspiration of the spirit), the priest was always\r\nconsidered as sacred as the god, and was called, during this period,\r\n_atua,_ god, though at other times only denominated _taura_ or\r\npriest."\r\n\r\nBut examples of such temporary inspiration are so common in every\r\npart of the world and are now so familiar through books on ethnology\r\nthat it is needless to multiply illustrations of the general\r\nprinciple. It may be well, however, to refer to two particular modes\r\nof producing temporary inspiration, because they are perhaps less\r\nknown than some others, and because we shall have occasion to refer\r\nto them later on. One of these modes of producing inspiration is by\r\nsucking the fresh blood of a sacrificed victim. In the temple of\r\nApollo Diradiotes at Argos, a lamb was sacrificed by night once a\r\nmonth; a woman, who had to observe a rule of chastity, tasted the\r\nblood of the lamb, and thus being inspired by the god she prophesied\r\nor divined. At Aegira in Achaia the priestess of Earth drank the\r\nfresh blood of a bull before she descended into the cave to\r\nprophesy. Similarly among the Kuruvikkarans, a class of\r\nbird-catchers and beggars in Southern India, the goddess Kali is\r\nbelieved to descend upon the priest, and he gives oracular replies\r\nafter sucking the blood which streams from the cut throat of a goat.\r\nAt a festival of the Alfoors of Minahassa, in Northern Celebes,\r\nafter a pig has been killed, the priest rushes furiously at it,\r\nthrusts his head into the carcase, and drinks of the blood. Then he\r\nis dragged away from it by force and set on a chair, whereupon he\r\nbegins to prophesy how the rice-crop will turn out that year. A\r\nsecond time he runs at the carcase and drinks of the blood; a second\r\ntime he is forced into the chair and continues his predictions. It\r\nis thought that there is a spirit in him which possesses the power\r\nof prophecy.\r\n\r\nThe other mode of producing temporary inspiration, to which I shall\r\nhere refer, consists in the use of a sacred tree or plant. Thus in\r\nthe Hindoo Koosh a fire is kindled with twigs of the sacred cedar;\r\nand the Dainyal or sibyl, with a cloth over her head, inhales the\r\nthick pungent smoke till she is seized with convulsions and falls\r\nsenseless to the ground. Soon she rises and raises a shrill chant,\r\nwhich is caught up and loudly repeated by her audience. So Apollo\'s\r\nprophetess ate the sacred laurel and was fumigated with it before\r\nshe prophesied. The Bacchanals ate ivy, and their inspired fury was\r\nby some believed to be due to the exciting and intoxicating\r\nproperties of the plant. In Uganda the priest, in order to be\r\ninspired by his god, smokes a pipe of tobacco fiercely till he works\r\nhimself into a frenzy; the loud excited tones in which he then talks\r\nare recognised as the voice of the god speaking through him. In\r\nMadura, an island off the north coast of Java, each spirit has its\r\nregular medium, who is oftener a woman than a man. To prepare\r\nherself for the reception of the spirit she inhales the fumes of\r\nincense, sitting with her head over a smoking censer. Gradually she\r\nfalls into a sort of trance accompanied by shrieks, grimaces, and\r\nviolent spasms. The spirit is now supposed to have entered into her,\r\nand when she grows calmer her words are regarded as oracular, being\r\nthe utterances of the indwelling spirit, while her own soul is\r\ntemporarily absent.\r\n\r\nThe person temporarily inspired is believed to acquire, not merely\r\ndivine knowledge, but also, at least occasionally, divine power. In\r\nCambodia, when an epidemic breaks out, the inhabitants of several\r\nvillages unite and go with a band of music at their head to look for\r\nthe man whom the local god is supposed to have chosen for his\r\ntemporary incarnation. When found, the man is conducted to the altar\r\nof the god, where the mystery of incarnation takes place. Then the\r\nman becomes an object of veneration to his fellows, who implore him\r\nto protect the village against the plague. A certain image of\r\nApollo, which stood in a sacred cave at Hylae near Magnesia, was\r\nthought to impart superhuman strength. Sacred men, inspired by it,\r\nleaped down precipices, tore up huge trees by the roots, and carried\r\nthem on their backs along the narrowest defiles. The feats performed\r\nby inspired dervishes belong to the same class.\r\n\r\nThus far we have seen that the savage, failing to discern the limits\r\nof his ability to control nature, ascribes to himself and to all men\r\ncertain powers which we should now call supernatural. Further, we\r\nhave seen that, over and above this general supernaturalism, some\r\npersons are supposed to be inspired for short periods by a divine\r\nspirit, and thus temporarily to enjoy the knowledge and power of the\r\nindwelling deity. From beliefs like these it is an easy step to the\r\nconviction that certain men are permanently possessed by a deity, or\r\nin some other undefined way are endued with so high a degree of\r\nsupernatural power as to be ranked as gods and to receive the homage\r\nof prayer and sacrifice. Sometimes these human gods are restricted\r\nto purely supernatural or spiritual functions. Sometimes they\r\nexercise supreme political power in addition. In the latter case\r\nthey are kings as well as gods, and the government is a theocracy.\r\nThus in the Marquesas or Washington Islands there was a class of men\r\nwho were deified in their lifetime. They were supposed to wield a\r\nsupernatural power over the elements: they could give abundant\r\nharvests or smite the ground with barrenness; and they could inflict\r\ndisease or death. Human sacrifices were offered to them to avert\r\ntheir wrath. There were not many of them, at the most one or two in\r\neach island. They lived in mystic seclusion. Their powers were\r\nsometimes, but not always, hereditary. A missionary has described\r\none of these human gods from personal observation. The god was a\r\nvery old man who lived in a large house within an enclosure. In the\r\nhouse was a kind of altar, and on the beams of the house and on the\r\ntrees round it were hung human skeletons, head down. No one entered\r\nthe enclosure except the persons dedicated to the service of the\r\ngod; only on days when human victims were sacrificed might ordinary\r\npeople penetrate into the precinct. This human god received more\r\nsacrifices than all the other gods; often he would sit on a sort of\r\nscaffold in front of his house and call for two or three human\r\nvictims at a time. They were always brought, for the terror he\r\ninspired was extreme. He was invoked all over the island, and\r\nofferings were sent to him from every side. Again, of the South Sea\r\nIslands in general we are told that each island had a man who\r\nrepresented or personified the divinity. Such men were called gods,\r\nand their substance was confounded with that of the deity. The\r\nman-god was sometimes the king himself; oftener he was a priest or\r\nsubordinate chief.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Egyptians, far from restricting their adoration to cats\r\nand dogs and such small deer, very liberally extended it to men. One\r\nof these human deities resided at the village of Anabis, and burnt\r\nsacrifices were offered to him on the altars; after which, says\r\nPorphyry, he would eat his dinner just as if he were an ordinary\r\nmortal. In classical antiquity the Sicilian philosopher Empedocles\r\ngave himself out to be not merely a wizard but a god. Addressing his\r\nfellow-citizens in verse he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "O friends, in this great city that climbs the yellow slope\r\n    Of Agrigentum\'s citadel, who make good works your scope,\r\n    Who offer to the stranger a haven quiet and fair,\r\n    All hail! Among you honoured I walk with lofty air.\r\n    With garlands, blooming garlands you crown my noble brow,\r\n    A mortal man no longer, a deathless godhead now.\r\n    Where e\'er I go, the people crowd round and worship pay,\r\n    And thousands follow seeking to learn the better way.\r\n    Some crave prophetic visions, some smit with anguish sore\r\n    Would fain hear words of comfort and suffer pain no more."\r\n\r\n\r\nHe asserted that he could teach his disciples how to make the wind\r\nto blow or be still, the rain to fall and the sun to shine, how to\r\nbanish sickness and old age and to raise the dead. When Demetrius\r\nPoliorcetes restored the Athenian democracy in 307 B.C., the\r\nAthenians decreed divine honours to him and his father Antigonus,\r\nboth of them being then alive, under the title of the Saviour Gods.\r\nAltars were set up to the Saviours, and a priest appointed to attend\r\nto their worship. The people went forth to meet their deliverer with\r\nhymns and dances, with garlands and incense and libations; they\r\nlined the streets and sang that he was the only true god, for the\r\nother gods slept, or dwelt far away, or were not. In the words of a\r\ncontemporary poet, which were chanted in public and sung in private:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "Of all the gods the greatest and the dearest\r\n    To the city are come.\r\n    For Demeter and Demetrius\r\n    Together time has brought.\r\n    She comes to hold the Maiden\'s awful rites,\r\n    And he joyous and fair and laughing,\r\n    As befits a god.\r\n    A glorious sight, with all his friends about him,\r\n    He in their midst,\r\n    They like to stars, and he the sun.\r\n    Son of Poseidon the mighty, Aphrodite\'s son,\r\n    All hail!\r\n    The other gods dwell far away,\r\n    Or have no ears,\r\n    Or are not, or pay us no heed.\r\n    But thee we present see,\r\n    No god of wood or stone, but godhead true.\r\n    Therefore to thee we pray."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancient Germans believed that there was something holy in women,\r\nand accordingly consulted them as oracles. Their sacred women, we\r\nare told, looked on the eddying rivers and listened to the murmur or\r\nthe roar of the water, and from the sight and sound foretold what\r\nwould come to pass. But often the veneration of the men went\r\nfurther, and they worshipped women as true and living goddesses. For\r\nexample, in the reign of Vespasian a certain Veleda, of the tribe of\r\nthe Bructeri, was commonly held to be a deity, and in that character\r\nreigned over her people, her sway being acknowledged far and wide.\r\nShe lived in a tower on the river Lippe, a tributary of the Rhine.\r\nWhen the people of Cologne sent to make a treaty with her, the\r\nambassadors were not admitted to her presence; the negotiations were\r\nconducted through a minister, who acted as the mouthpiece of her\r\ndivinity and reported her oracular utterances. The example shows how\r\neasily among our rude forefathers the ideas of divinity and royalty\r\ncoalesced. It is said that among the Getae down to the beginning of\r\nour era there was always a man who personified a god and was called\r\nGod by the people. He dwelt on a sacred mountain and acted as\r\nadviser to the king.\r\n\r\nAccording to the early Portuguese historian, Dos Santos, the Zimbas,\r\nor Muzimbas, a people of South-eastern Africa, "do not adore idols\r\nor recognize any god, but instead they venerate and honour their\r\nking, whom they regard as a divinity, and they say he is the\r\ngreatest and best in the world. And the said king says of himself\r\nthat he alone is god of the earth, for which reason if it rains when\r\nhe does not wish it to do so, or is too hot, he shoots arrows at the\r\nsky for not obeying him." The Mashona of Southern Africa informed\r\ntheir bishop that they had once had a god, but that the Matabeles\r\nhad driven him away. "This last was in reference to a curious custom\r\nin some villages of keeping a man they called their god. He seemed\r\nto be consulted by the people and had presents given to him. There\r\nwas one at a village belonging to a chief Magondi, in the old days.\r\nWe were asked not to fire off any guns near the village, or we\r\nshould frighten him away." This Mashona god was formerly bound to\r\nrender an annual tribute to the king of the Matabele in the shape of\r\nfour black oxen and one dance. A missionary has seen and described\r\nthe deity discharging the latter part of his duty in front of the\r\nroyal hut. For three mortal hours, without a break, to the banging\r\nof a tambourine, the click of castanettes, and the drone of a\r\nmonotonous song, the swarthy god engaged in a frenzied dance,\r\ncrouching on his hams like a tailor, sweating like a pig, and\r\nbounding about with an agility which testified to the strength and\r\nelasticity of his divine legs.\r\n\r\nThe Baganda of Central Africa believed in a god of Lake Nyanza, who\r\nsometimes took up his abode in a man or woman. The incarnate god was\r\nmuch feared by all the people, including the king and the chiefs.\r\nWhen the mystery of incarnation had taken place, the man, or rather\r\nthe god, removed about a mile and a half from the margin of the\r\nlake, and there awaited the appearance of the new moon before he\r\nengaged in his sacred duties. From the moment that the crescent moon\r\nappeared faintly in the sky, the king and all his subjects were at\r\nthe command of the divine man, or _Lubare_ (god), as he was called,\r\nwho reigned supreme not only in matters of faith and ritual, but\r\nalso in questions of war and state policy. He was consulted as an\r\noracle; by his word he could inflict or heal sickness, withhold\r\nrain, and cause famine. Large presents were made him when his advice\r\nwas sought. The chief of Urua, a large region to the west of Lake\r\nTanganyika, "arrogates to himself divine honours and power and\r\npretends to abstain from food for days without feeling its\r\nnecessity; and, indeed, declares that as a god he is altogether\r\nabove requiring food and only eats, drinks, and smokes for the\r\npleasure it affords him." Among the Gallas, when a woman grows tired\r\nof the cares of housekeeping, she begins to talk incoherently and to\r\ndemean herself extravagantly. This is a sign of the descent of the\r\nholy spirit Callo upon her. Immediately her husband prostrates\r\nhimself and adores her; she ceases to bear the humble title of wife\r\nand is called "Lord"; domestic duties have no further claim on her,\r\nand her will is a divine law.\r\n\r\nThe king of Loango is honoured by his people "as though he were a\r\ngod; and he is called Sambee and Pango, which mean god. They believe\r\nthat he can let them have rain when he likes; and once a year, in\r\nDecember, which is the time they want rain, the people come to beg\r\nof him to grant it to them." On this occasion the king, standing on\r\nhis throne, shoots an arrow into the air, which is supposed to bring\r\non rain. Much the same is said of the king of Mombasa. Down to a few\r\nyears ago, when his spiritual reign on earth was brought to an\r\nabrupt end by the carnal weapons of English marines and bluejackets,\r\nthe king of Benin was the chief object of worship in his dominions.\r\n"He occupies a higher post here than the Pope does in Catholic\r\nEurope; for he is not only God\'s vicegerent upon earth, but a god\r\nhimself, whose subjects both obey and adore him as such, although I\r\nbelieve their adoration to arise rather from fear than love." The\r\nking of Iddah told the English officers of the Niger Expedition,\r\n"God made me after his own image; I am all the same as God; and he\r\nappointed me a king."\r\n\r\nA peculiarly bloodthirsty monarch of Burma, by name Badonsachen,\r\nwhose very countenance reflected the inbred ferocity of his nature,\r\nand under whose reign more victims perished by the executioner than\r\nby the common enemy, conceived the notion that he was something more\r\nthan mortal, and that this high distinction had been granted him as\r\na reward for his numerous good works. Accordingly he laid aside the\r\ntitle of king and aimed at making himself a god. With this view, and\r\nin imitation of Buddha, who, before being advanced to the rank of a\r\ndivinity, had quitted his royal palace and seraglio and retired from\r\nthe world, Badonsachen withdrew from his palace to an immense\r\npagoda, the largest in the empire, which he had been engaged in\r\nconstructing for many years. Here he held conferences with the most\r\nlearned monks, in which he sought to persuade them that the five\r\nthousand years assigned for the observance of the law of Buddha were\r\nnow elapsed, and that he himself was the god who was destined to\r\nappear after that period, and to abolish the old law by substituting\r\nhis own. But to his great mortification many of the monks undertook\r\nto demonstrate the contrary; and this disappointment, combined with\r\nhis love of power and his impatience under the restraints of an\r\nascetic life, quickly disabused him of his imaginary godhead, and\r\ndrove him back to his palace and his harem. The king of Siam "is\r\nvenerated equally with a divinity. His subjects ought not to look\r\nhim in the face; they prostrate themselves before him when he\r\npasses, and appear before him on their knees, their elbows resting\r\non the ground." There is a special language devoted to his sacred\r\nperson and attributes, and it must be used by all who speak to or of\r\nhim. Even the natives have difficulty in mastering this peculiar\r\nvocabulary. The hairs of the monarch\'s head, the soles of his feet,\r\nthe breath of his body, indeed every single detail of his person,\r\nboth outward and inward, have particular names. When he eats or\r\ndrinks, sleeps or walks, a special word indicates that these acts\r\nare being performed by the sovereign, and such words cannot possibly\r\nbe applied to the acts of any other person whatever. There is no\r\nword in the Siamese language by which any creature of higher rank or\r\ngreater dignity than a monarch can be described; and the\r\nmissionaries, when they speak of God, are forced to use the native\r\nword for king.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps no country in the world has been so prolific of human\r\ngods as India; nowhere has the divine grace been poured out in a\r\nmore liberal measure on all classes of society from kings down to\r\nmilkmen. Thus amongst the Todas, a pastoral people of the Neilgherry\r\nHills of Southern India, the dairy is a sanctuary, and the milkman\r\nwho attends to it has been described as a god. On being asked\r\nwhether the Todas salute the sun, one of these divine milkmen\r\nreplied, "Those poor fellows do so, but I," tapping his chest, "I, a\r\ngod! why should I salute the sun?" Every one, even his own father,\r\nprostrates himself before the milkman, and no one would dare to\r\nrefuse him anything. No human being, except another milkman, may\r\ntouch him; and he gives oracles to all who consult him, speaking\r\nwith the voice of a god.\r\n\r\nFurther, in India "every king is regarded as little short of a\r\npresent god." The Hindoo law-book of Manu goes farther and says that\r\n"even an infant king must not be despised from an idea that he is a\r\nmere mortal; for he is a great deity in human form." There is said\r\nto have been a sect in Orissa some years ago who worshipped the late\r\nQueen Victoria in her lifetime as their chief divinity. And to this\r\nday in India all living persons remarkable for great strength or\r\nvalour or for supposed miraculous powers run the risk of being\r\nworshipped as gods. Thus, a sect in the Punjaub worshipped a deity\r\nwhom they called Nikkal Sen. This Nikkal Sen was no other than the\r\nredoubted General Nicholson, and nothing that the general could do\r\nor say damped the ardour of his adorers. The more he punished them,\r\nthe greater grew the religious awe with which they worshipped him.\r\nAt Benares not many years ago a celebrated deity was incarnate in\r\nthe person of a Hindoo gentleman who rejoiced in the euphonious name\r\nof Swami Bhaskaranandaji Saraswati, and looked uncommonly like the\r\nlate Cardinal Manning, only more ingenuous. His eyes beamed with\r\nkindly human interest, and he took what is described as an innocent\r\npleasure in the divine honours paid him by his confiding\r\nworshippers.\r\n\r\nAt Chinchvad, a small town about ten miles from Poona in Western\r\nIndia, there lives a family of whom one in each generation is\r\nbelieved by a large proportion of the Mahrattas to be an incarnation\r\nof the elephant-headed god Gunputty. That celebrated deity was first\r\nmade flesh about the year 1640 in the person of a Brahman of Poona,\r\nby name Mooraba Gosseyn, who sought to work out his salvation by\r\nabstinence, mortification, and prayer. His piety had its reward. The\r\ngod himself appeared to him in a vision of the night and promised\r\nthat a portion of his, that is, of Gunputty\'s holy spirit should\r\nabide with him and with his seed after him even to the seventh\r\ngeneration. The divine promise was fulfilled. Seven successive\r\nincarnations, transmitted from father to son, manifested the light\r\nof Gunputty to a dark world. The last of the direct line, a\r\nheavy-looking god with very weak eyes, died in the year 1810. But\r\nthe cause of truth was too sacred, and the value of the church\r\nproperty too considerable, to allow the Brahmans to contemplate with\r\nequanimity the unspeakable loss that would be sustained by a world\r\nwhich knew not Gunputty. Accordingly they sought and found a holy\r\nvessel in whom the divine spirit of the master had revealed itself\r\nanew, and the revelation has been happily continued in an unbroken\r\nsuccession of vessels from that time to this. But a mysterious law\r\nof spiritual economy, whose operation in the history of religion we\r\nmay deplore though we cannot alter, has decreed that the miracles\r\nwrought by the god-man in these degenerate days cannot compare with\r\nthose which were wrought by his predecessors in days gone by; and it\r\nis even reported that the only sign vouchsafed by him to the present\r\ngeneration of vipers is the miracle of feeding the multitude whom he\r\nannually entertains to dinner at Chinchvad.\r\n\r\nA Hindoo sect, which has many representatives in Bombay and Central\r\nIndia, holds that its spiritual chiefs or Maharajas, as they are\r\ncalled, are representatives or even actual incarnations on earth of\r\nthe god Krishna. And as Krishna looks down from heaven with most\r\nfavour on such as minister to the wants of his successors and vicars\r\non earth, a peculiar rite called Self-devotion has been instituted,\r\nwhereby his faithful worshippers make over their bodies, their\r\nsouls, and, what is perhaps still more important, their worldly\r\nsubstance to his adorable incarnations; and women are taught to\r\nbelieve that the highest bliss for themselves and their families is\r\nto be attained by yielding themselves to the embraces of those\r\nbeings in whom the divine nature mysteriously coexists with the form\r\nand even the appetites of true humanity.\r\n\r\nChristianity itself has not uniformly escaped the taint of these\r\nunhappy delusions; indeed it has often been sullied by the\r\nextravagances of vain pretenders to a divinity equal to or even\r\nsurpassing that of its great Founder. In the second century Montanus\r\nthe Phrygian claimed to be the incarnate Trinity, uniting in his\r\nsingle person God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost.\r\nNor is this an isolated case, the exorbitant pretension of a single\r\nill-balanced mind. From the earliest times down to the present day\r\nmany sects have believed that Christ, nay God himself, is incarnate\r\nin every fully initiated Christian, and they have carried this\r\nbelief to its logical conclusion by adoring each other. Tertullian\r\nrecords that this was done by his fellow-Christians at Carthage in\r\nthe second century; the disciples of St. Columba worshipped him as\r\nan embodiment of Christ; and in the eighth century Elipandus of\r\nToledo spoke of Christ as "a god among gods," meaning that all\r\nbelievers were gods just as truly as Jesus himself. The adoration of\r\neach other was customary among the Albigenses, and is noticed\r\nhundreds of times in the records of the Inquisition at Toulouse in\r\nthe early part of the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century there arose a sect called the Brethren and\r\nSisters of the Free Spirit, who held that by long and assiduous\r\ncontemplation any man might be united to the deity in an ineffable\r\nmanner and become one with the source and parent of all things, and\r\nthat he who had thus ascended to God and been absorbed in his\r\nbeatific essence, actually formed part of the Godhead, was the Son\r\nof God in the same sense and manner with Christ himself, and enjoyed\r\nthereby a glorious immunity from the trammels of all laws human and\r\ndivine. Inwardly transported by this blissful persuasion, though\r\noutwardly presenting in their aspect and manners a shocking air of\r\nlunacy and distraction, the sectaries roamed from place to place,\r\nattired in the most fantastic apparel and begging their bread with\r\nwild shouts and clamour, spurning indignantly every kind of honest\r\nlabour and industry as an obstacle to divine contemplation and to\r\nthe ascent of the soul towards the Father of spirits. In all their\r\nexcursions they were followed by women with whom they lived on terms\r\nof the closest familiarity. Those of them who conceived they had\r\nmade the greatest proficiency in the higher spiritual life dispensed\r\nwith the use of clothes altogether in their assemblies, looking upon\r\ndecency and modesty as marks of inward corruption, characteristics\r\nof a soul that still grovelled under the dominion of the flesh and\r\nhad not yet been elevated into communion with the divine spirit, its\r\ncentre and source. Sometimes their progress towards this mystic\r\ncommunion was accelerated by the Inquisition, and they expired in\r\nthe flames, not merely with unclouded serenity, but with the most\r\ntriumphant feelings of cheerfulness and joy.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1830 there appeared, in one of the States of the\r\nAmerican Union bordering on Kentucky, an impostor who declared that\r\nhe was the Son of God, the Saviour of mankind, and that he had\r\nreappeared on earth to recall the impious, the unbelieving, and\r\nsinners to their duty. He protested that if they did not mend their\r\nways within a certain time, he would give the signal, and in a\r\nmoment the world would crumble to ruins. These extravagant\r\npretensions were received with favour even by persons of wealth and\r\nposition in society. At last a German humbly besought the new\r\nMessiah to announce the dreadful catastrophe to his\r\nfellow-countrymen in the German language, as they did not understand\r\nEnglish, and it seemed a pity that they should be damned merely on\r\nthat account. The would-be Saviour in reply confessed with great\r\ncandour that he did not know German. "What!" retorted the German,\r\n"you the Son of God, and don\'t speak all languages, and don\'t even\r\nknow German? Come, come, you are a knave, a hypocrite, and a madman.\r\nBedlam is the place for you." The spectators laughed, and went away\r\nashamed of their credulity.\r\n\r\nSometimes, at the death of the human incarnation, the divine spirit\r\ntransmigrates into another man. The Buddhist Tartars believe in a\r\ngreat number of living Buddhas, who officiate as Grand Lamas at the\r\nhead of the most important monasteries. When one of these Grand\r\nLamas dies his disciples do not sorrow, for they know that he will\r\nsoon reappear, being born in the form of an infant. Their only\r\nanxiety is to discover the place of his birth. If at this time they\r\nsee a rainbow they take it as a sign sent them by the departed Lama\r\nto guide them to his cradle. Sometimes the divine infant himself\r\nreveals his identity. "I am the Grand Lama," he says, "the living\r\nBuddha of such and such a temple. Take me to my old monastery. I am\r\nits immortal head." In whatever way the birthplace of the Buddha is\r\nrevealed, whether by the Buddha\'s own avowal or by the sign in the\r\nsky, tents are struck, and the joyful pilgrims, often headed by the\r\nking or one of the most illustrious of the royal family, set forth\r\nto find and bring home the infant god. Generally he is born in\r\nTibet, the holy land, and to reach him the caravan has often to\r\ntraverse the most frightful deserts. When at last they find the\r\nchild they fall down and worship him. Before, however, he is\r\nacknowledged as the Grand Lama whom they seek he must satisfy them\r\nof his identity. He is asked the name of the monastery of which he\r\nclaims to be the head, how far off it is, and how many monks live in\r\nit; he must also describe the habits of the deceased Grand Lama and\r\nthe manner of his death. Then various articles, as prayer-books,\r\ntea-pots, and cups, are placed before him, and he has to point out\r\nthose used by himself in his previous life. If he does so without a\r\nmistake his claims are admitted, and he is conducted in triumph to\r\nthe monastery. At the head of all the Lamas is the Dalai Lama of\r\nLhasa, the Rome of Tibet. He is regarded as a living god, and at\r\ndeath his divine and immortal spirit is born again in a child.\r\nAccording to some accounts the mode of discovering the Dalai Lama is\r\nsimilar to the method, already described, of discovering an ordinary\r\nGrand Lama. Other accounts speak of an election by drawing lots from\r\na golden jar. Wherever he is born, the trees and plants put forth\r\ngreen leaves; at his bidding flowers bloom and springs of water\r\nrise; and his presence diffuses heavenly blessings.\r\n\r\nBut he is by no means the only man who poses as a god in these\r\nregions. A register of all the incarnate gods in the Chinese empire\r\nis kept in the _Li fan yiian_ or Colonial Office at Peking. The\r\nnumber of gods who have thus taken out a license is one hundred and\r\nsixty. Tibet is blessed with thirty of them, Northern Mongolia\r\nrejoices in nineteen, and Southern Mongolia basks in the sunshine of\r\nno less than fifty-seven. The Chinese government, with a paternal\r\nsolicitude for the welfare of its subjects, forbids the gods on the\r\nregister to be reborn anywhere but in Tibet. They fear lest the\r\nbirth of a god in Mongolia should have serious political\r\nconsequences by stirring the dormant patriotism and warlike spirit\r\nof the Mongols, who might rally round an ambitious native deity of\r\nroyal lineage and seek to win for him, at the point of the sword, a\r\ntemporal as well as a spiritual kingdom. But besides these public or\r\nlicensed gods there are a great many little private gods, or\r\nunlicensed practitioners of divinity, who work miracles and bless\r\ntheir people in holes and corners; and of late years the Chinese\r\ngovernment has winked at the rebirth of these pettifogging deities\r\noutside of Tibet. However, once they are born, the government keeps\r\nits eye on them as well as on the regular practitioners, and if any\r\nof them misbehaves he is promptly degraded, banished to a distant\r\nmonastery, and strictly forbidden ever to be born again in the\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\nFrom our survey of the religious position occupied by the king in\r\nrude societies we may infer that the claim to divine and\r\nsupernatural powers put forward by the monarchs of great historical\r\nempires like those of Egypt, Mexico, and Peru, was not the simple\r\noutcome of inflated vanity or the empty expression of a grovelling\r\nadulation; it was merely a survival and extension of the old savage\r\napotheosis of living kings. Thus, for example, as children of the\r\nSun the Incas of Peru were revered like gods; they could do no\r\nwrong, and no one dreamed of offending against the person, honour,\r\nor property of the monarch or of any of the royal race. Hence, too,\r\nthe Incas did not, like most people, look on sickness as an evil.\r\nThey considered it a messenger sent from their father the Sun to\r\ncall them to come and rest with him in heaven. Therefore the usual\r\nwords in which an Inca announced his approaching end were these: "My\r\nfather calls me to come and rest with him." They would not oppose\r\ntheir father\'s will by offering sacrifice for recovery, but openly\r\ndeclared that he had called them to his rest. Issuing from the\r\nsultry valleys upon the lofty tableland of the Colombian Andes, the\r\nSpanish conquerors were astonished to find, in contrast to the\r\nsavage hordes they had left in the sweltering jungles below, a\r\npeople enjoying a fair degree of civilisation, practising\r\nagriculture, and living under a government which Humboldt has\r\ncompared to the theocracies of Tibet and Japan. These were the\r\nChibchas, Muyscas, or Mozcas, divided into two kingdoms, with\r\ncapitals at Bogota and Tunja, but united apparently in spiritual\r\nallegiance to the high pontiff of Sogamozo or Iraca. By a long and\r\nascetic novitiate, this ghostly ruler was reputed to have acquired\r\nsuch sanctity that the waters and the rain obeyed him, and the\r\nweather depended on his will. The Mexican kings at their accession,\r\nas we have seen, took an oath that they would make the sun to shine,\r\nthe clouds to give rain, the rivers to flow, and the earth to bring\r\nforth fruits in abundance. We are told that Montezuma, the last king\r\nof Mexico, was worshipped by his people as a god.\r\n\r\nThe early Babylonian kings, from the time of Sargon I. till the\r\nfourth dynasty of Ur or later, claimed to be gods in their lifetime.\r\nThe monarchs of the fourth dynasty of Ur in particular had temples\r\nbuilt in their honour; they set up their statues in various\r\nsanctuaries and commanded the people to sacrifice to them; the\r\neighth month was especially dedicated to the kings, and sacrifices\r\nwere offered to them at the new moon and on the fifteenth of each\r\nmonth. Again, the Parthian monarchs of the Arsacid house styled\r\nthemselves brothers of the sun and moon and were worshipped as\r\ndeities. It was esteemed sacrilege to strike even a private member\r\nof the Arsacid family in a brawl.\r\n\r\nThe kings of Egypt were deified in their lifetime, sacrifices were\r\noffered to them, and their worship was celebrated in special temples\r\nand by special priests. Indeed the worship of the kings sometimes\r\ncast that of the gods into the shade. Thus in the reign of Merenra a\r\nhigh official declared that he had built many holy places in order\r\nthat the spirits of the king, the ever-living Merenra, might be\r\ninvoked "more than all the gods." "It has never been doubted that\r\nthe king claimed actual divinity; he was the \'great god,\' the\'golden\r\nHorus,\' and son of Ra. He claimed authority not only over Egypt, but\r\nover\'all lands and nations,\'\'the whole world in its length and its\r\nbreadth, the east and the west,\'\'the entire compass of the great\r\ncircuit of the sun,\'\'the sky and what is in it, the earth and all\r\nthat is upon it,\'\'every creature that walks upon two or upon four\r\nlegs, all that fly or flutter, the whole world offers her\r\nproductions to him.\' Whatever in fact might be asserted of the\r\nSun-god, was dogmatically predicable of the king of Egypt. His\r\ntitles were directly derived from those of the Sun-god." "In the\r\ncourse of his existence," we are told, "the king of Egypt exhausted\r\nall the possible conceptions of divinity which the Egyptians had\r\nframed for themselves. A superhuman god by his birth and by his\r\nroyal office, he became the deified man after his death. Thus all\r\nthat was known of the divine was summed up in him."\r\n\r\nWe have now completed our sketch, for it is no more than a sketch,\r\nof the evolution of that sacred kingship which attained its highest\r\nform, its most absolute expression, in the monarchies of Peru and\r\nEgypt. Historically, the institution appears to have originated in\r\nthe order of public magicians or medicine-men; logically it rests on\r\na mistaken deduction from the association of ideas. Men mistook the\r\norder of their ideas for the order of nature, and hence imagined\r\nthat the control which they have, or seem to have, over their\r\nthoughts, permitted them to exercise a corresponding control over\r\nthings. The men who for one reason or another, because of the\r\nstrength or the weakness of their natural parts, were supposed to\r\npossess these magical powers in the highest degree, were gradually\r\nmarked off from their fellows and became a separate class, who were\r\ndestined to exercise a most far-reaching influence on the political,\r\nreligious, and intellectual evolution of mankind. Social progress,\r\nas we know, consists mainly in a successive differentiation of\r\nfunctions, or, in simpler language, a division of labour. The work\r\nwhich in primitive society is done by all alike and by all equally\r\nill, or nearly so, is gradually distributed among different classes\r\nof workers and executed more and more perfectly; and so far as the\r\nproducts, material or immaterial, of this specialised labour are\r\nshared by all, the whole community benefits by the increasing\r\nspecialisation. Now magicians or medicine-men appear to constitute\r\nthe oldest artificial or professional class in the evolution of\r\nsociety. For sorcerers are found in every savage tribe known to us;\r\nand among the lowest savages, such as the Australian aborigines,\r\nthey are the only professional class that exists. As time goes on,\r\nand the process of differentiation continues, the order of\r\nmedicine-men is itself subdivided into such classes as the healers\r\nof disease, the makers of rain, and so forth; while the most\r\npowerful member of the order wins for himself a position as chief\r\nand gradually develops into a sacred king, his old magical functions\r\nfalling more and more into the background and being exchanged for\r\npriestly or even divine duties, in proportion as magic is slowly\r\nousted by religion. Still later, a partition is effected between the\r\ncivil and the religious aspect of the kingship, the temporal power\r\nbeing committed to one man and the spiritual to another. Meanwhile\r\nthe magicians, who may be repressed but cannot be extirpated by the\r\npredominance of religion, still addict themselves to their old\r\noccult arts in preference to the newer ritual of sacrifice and\r\nprayer; and in time the more sagacious of their number perceive the\r\nfallacy of magic and hit upon a more effectual mode of manipulating\r\nthe forces of nature for the good of man; in short, they abandon\r\nsorcery for science. I am far from affirming that the course of\r\ndevelopment has everywhere rigidly followed these lines: it has\r\ndoubtless varied greatly in different societies. I merely mean to\r\nindicate in the broadest outline what I conceive to have been its\r\ngeneral trend. Regarded from the industrial point of view the\r\nevolution has been from uniformity to diversity of function:\r\nregarded from the political point of view, it has been from\r\ndemocracy to despotism. With the later history of monarchy,\r\nespecially with the decay of despotism and its displacement by forms\r\nof government better adapted to the higher needs of humanity, we are\r\nnot concerned in this enquiry: our theme is the growth, not the\r\ndecay, of a great and, in its time, beneficent institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. Departmental Kings of Nature\r\n\r\nTHE PRECEDING investigation has proved that the same union of sacred\r\nfunctions with a royal title which meets us in the King of the Wood\r\nat Nemi, the Sacrificial King at Rome, and the magistrate called the\r\nKing at Athens, occurs frequently outside the limits of classical\r\nantiquity and is a common feature of societies at all stages from\r\nbarbarism to civilisation. Further, it appears that the royal priest\r\nis often a king, not only in name but in fact, swaying the sceptre\r\nas well as the crosier. All this confirms the traditional view of\r\nthe origin of the titular and priestly kings in the republics of\r\nancient Greece and Italy. At least by showing that the combination\r\nof spiritual and temporal power, of which Graeco-Italian tradition\r\npreserved the memory, has actually existed in many places, we have\r\nobviated any suspicion of improbability that might have attached to\r\nthe tradition. Therefore we may now fairly ask, May not the King of\r\nthe Wood have had an origin like that which a probable tradition\r\nassigns to the Sacrificial King of Rome and the titular King of\r\nAthens? In other words, may not his predecessors in office have been\r\na line of kings whom a republican revolution stripped of their\r\npolitical power, leaving them only their religious functions and the\r\nshadow of a crown? There are at least two reasons for answering this\r\nquestion in the negative. One reason is drawn from the abode of the\r\npriest of Nemi; the other from his title, the King of the Wood. If\r\nhis predecessors had been kings in the ordinary sense, he would\r\nsurely have been found residing, like the fallen kings of Rome and\r\nAthens, in the city of which the sceptre had passed from him. This\r\ncity must have been Aricia, for there was none nearer. But Aricia\r\nwas three miles off from his forest sanctuary by the lake shore. If\r\nhe reigned, it was not in the city, but in the greenwood. Again his\r\ntitle, King of the Wood, hardly allows us to suppose that he had\r\never been a king in the common sense of the word. More likely he was\r\na king of nature, and of a special side of nature, namely, the woods\r\nfrom which he took his title. If we could find instances of what we\r\nmay call departmental kings of nature, that is of persons supposed\r\nto rule over particular elements or aspects of nature, they would\r\nprobably present a closer analogy to the King of the Wood than the\r\ndivine kings we have been hitherto considering, whose control of\r\nnature is general rather than special. Instances of such\r\ndepartmental kings are not wanting.\r\n\r\nOn a hill at Bomma near the mouth of the Congo dwells Namvulu Vumu,\r\nKing of the Rain and Storm. Of some of the tribes on the Upper Nile\r\nwe are told that they have no kings in the common sense; the only\r\npersons whom they acknowledge as such are the Kings of the Rain,\r\n_Mata Kodou,_ who are credited with the power of giving rain at the\r\nproper time, that is, the rainy season. Before the rains begin to\r\nfall at the end of March the country is a parched and arid desert;\r\nand the cattle, which form the people\'s chief wealth, perish for\r\nlack of grass. So, when the end of March draws on, each householder\r\nbetakes himself to the King of the Rain and offers him a cow that he\r\nmay make the blessed waters of heaven to drip on the brown and\r\nwithered pastures. If no shower falls, the people assemble and\r\ndemand that the king shall give them rain; and if the sky still\r\ncontinues cloudless, they rip up his belly, in which he is believed\r\nto keep the storms. Amongst the Bari tribe one of these Rain Kings\r\nmade rain by sprinkling water on the ground out of a handbell.\r\n\r\nAmong tribes on the outskirts of Abyssinia a similar office exists\r\nand has been thus described by an observer: "The priesthood of the\r\nAlfai, as he is called by the Barea and Kunama, is a remarkable one;\r\nhe is believed to be able to make rain. This office formerly existed\r\namong the Algeds and appears to be still common to the Nuba negroes.\r\nThe Alfai of the Barea, who is also consulted by the northern\r\nKunama, lives near Tembadere on a mountain alone with his family.\r\nThe people bring him tribute in the form of clothes and fruits, and\r\ncultivate for him a large field of his own. He is a kind of king,\r\nand his office passes by inheritance to his brother or sister\'s son.\r\nHe is supposed to conjure down rain and to drive away the locusts.\r\nBut if he disappoints the people\'s expectation and a great drought\r\narises in the land, the Alfai is stoned to death, and his nearest\r\nrelations are obliged to cast the first stone at him. When we passed\r\nthrough the country, the office of Alfai was still held by an old\r\nman; but I heard that rain-making had proved too dangerous for him\r\nand that he had renounced his office."\r\n\r\nIn the backwoods of Cambodia live two mysterious sovereigns known as\r\nthe King of the Fire and the King of the Water. Their fame is spread\r\nall over the south of the great Indo-Chinese peninsula; but only a\r\nfaint echo of it has reached the West. Down to a few years ago no\r\nEuropean, so far as is known, had ever seen either of them; and\r\ntheir very existence might have passed for a fable, were it not that\r\ntill lately communications were regularly maintained between them\r\nand the King of Cambodia, who year by year exchanged presents with\r\nthem. Their royal functions are of a purely mystic or spiritual\r\norder; they have no political authority; they are simple peasants,\r\nliving by the sweat of their brow and the offerings of the faithful.\r\nAccording to one account they live in absolute solitude, never\r\nmeeting each other and never seeing a human face. They inhabit\r\nsuccessively seven towers perched upon seven mountains, and every\r\nyear they pass from one tower to another. People come furtively and\r\ncast within their reach what is needful for their subsistence. The\r\nkingship lasts seven years, the time necessary to inhabit all the\r\ntowers successively; but many die before their time is out. The\r\noffices are hereditary in one or (according to others) two royal\r\nfamilies, who enjoy high consideration, have revenues assigned to\r\nthem, and are exempt from the necessity of tilling the ground. But\r\nnaturally the dignity is not coveted, and when a vacancy occurs, all\r\neligible men (they must be strong and have children) flee and hide\r\nthemselves. Another account, admitting the reluctance of the\r\nhereditary candidates to accept the crown, does not countenance the\r\nreport of their hermit-like seclusion in the seven towers. For it\r\nrepresents the people as prostrating themselves before the mystic\r\nkings whenever they appear in public, it being thought that a\r\nterrible hurricane would burst over the country if this mark of\r\nhomage were omitted. Like many other sacred kings, of whom we shall\r\nread in the sequel, the Kings of Fire and Water are not allowed to\r\ndie a natural death, for that would lower their reputation.\r\nAccordingly when one of them is seriously ill, the elders hold a\r\nconsultation and if they think he cannot recover they stab him to\r\ndeath. His body is burned and the ashes are piously collected and\r\npublicly honoured for five years. Part of them is given to the\r\nwidow, and she keeps them in an urn, which she must carry on her\r\nback when she goes to weep on her husband\'s grave.\r\n\r\nWe are told that the Fire King, the more important of the two, whose\r\nsupernatural powers have never been questioned, officiates at\r\nmarriages, festivals, and sacrifices in honour of the _Yan_ or\r\nspirit. On these occasions a special place is set apart for him; and\r\nthe path by which he approaches is spread with white cotton cloths.\r\nA reason for confining the royal dignity to the same family is that\r\nthis family is in possession of certain famous talismans which would\r\nlose their virtue or disappear if they passed out of the family.\r\nThese talismans are three: the fruit of a creeper called _Cui,_\r\ngathered ages ago at the time of the last deluge, but still fresh\r\nand green; a rattan, also very old but bearing flowers that never\r\nfade; and lastly, a sword containing a _Yan_ or spirit, who guards\r\nit constantly and works miracles with it. The spirit is said to be\r\nthat of a slave, whose blood chanced to fall upon the blade while it\r\nwas being forged, and who died a voluntary death to expiate his\r\ninvoluntary offence. By means of the two former talismans the Water\r\nKing can raise a flood that would drown the whole earth. If the Fire\r\nKing draws the magic sword a few inches from its sheath, the sun is\r\nhidden and men and beasts fall into a profound sleep; were he to\r\ndraw it quite out of the scabbard, the world would come to an end.\r\nTo this wondrous brand sacrifices of buffaloes, pigs, fowls, and\r\nducks are offered for rain. It is kept swathed in cotton and silk;\r\nand amongst the annual presents sent by the King of Cambodia were\r\nrich stuffs to wrap the sacred sword.\r\n\r\nContrary to the common usage of the country, which is to bury the\r\ndead, the bodies of both these mystic monarchs are burnt, but their\r\nnails and some of their teeth and bones are religiously preserved as\r\namulets. It is while the corpse is being consumed on the pyre that\r\nthe kinsmen of the deceased magician flee to the forest and hide\r\nthemselves, for fear of being elevated to the invidious dignity\r\nwhich he has just vacated. The people go and search for them, and\r\nthe first whose lurking place they discover is made King of Fire or\r\nWater.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are examples of what I have called departmental kings\r\nof nature. But it is a far cry to Italy from the forests of Cambodia\r\nand the sources of the Nile. And though Kings of Rain, Water, and\r\nFire have been found, we have still to discover a King of the Wood\r\nto match the Arician priest who bore that title. Perhaps we shall\r\nfind him nearer home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. The Worship of Trees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Tree-spirits\r\n\r\nIN THE RELIGIOUS history of the Aryan race in Europe the worship of\r\ntrees has played an important part. Nothing could be more natural.\r\nFor at the dawn of history Europe was covered with immense primaeval\r\nforests, in which the scattered clearings must have appeared like\r\nislets in an ocean of green. Down to the first century before our\r\nera the Hercynian forest stretched eastward from the Rhine for a\r\ndistance at once vast and unknown; Germans whom Caesar questioned\r\nhad travelled for two months through it without reaching the end.\r\nFour centuries later it was visited by the Emperor Julian, and the\r\nsolitude, the gloom, the silence of the forest appear to have made a\r\ndeep impression on his sensitive nature. He declared that he knew\r\nnothing like it in the Roman empire. In our own country the wealds\r\nof Kent, Surrey, and Sussex are remnants of the great forest of\r\nAnderida, which once clothed the whole of the south-eastern portion\r\nof the island. Westward it seems to have stretched till it joined\r\nanother forest that extended from Hampshire to Devon. In the reign\r\nof Henry II. the citizens of London still hunted the wild bull and\r\nthe boar in the woods of Hampstead. Even under the later\r\nPlantagenets the royal forests were sixty-eight in number. In the\r\nforest of Arden it was said that down to modern times a squirrel\r\nmight leap from tree to tree for nearly the whole length of\r\nWarwickshire. The excavation of ancient pile-villages in the valley\r\nof the Po has shown that long before the rise and probably the\r\nfoundation of Rome the north of Italy was covered with dense woods\r\nof elms, chestnuts, and especially of oaks. Archaeology is here\r\nconfirmed by history; for classical writers contain many references\r\nto Italian forests which have now disappeared. As late as the fourth\r\ncentury before our era Rome was divided from central Etruria by the\r\ndreaded Ciminian forest, which Livy compares to the woods of\r\nGermany. No merchant, if we may trust the Roman historian, had ever\r\npenetrated its pathless solitudes; and it was deemed a most daring\r\nfeat when a Roman general, after sending two scouts to explore its\r\nintricacies, led his army into the forest and, making his way to a\r\nridge of the wooded mountains, looked down on the rich Etrurian\r\nfields spread out below. In Greece beautiful woods of pine, oak, and\r\nother trees still linger on the slopes of the high Arcadian\r\nmountains, still adorn with their verdure the deep gorge through\r\nwhich the Ladon hurries to join the sacred Alpheus, and were still,\r\ndown to a few years ago, mirrored in the dark blue waters of the\r\nlonely lake of Pheneus; but they are mere fragments of the forests\r\nwhich clothed great tracts in antiquity, and which at a more remote\r\nepoch may have spanned the Greek peninsula from sea to sea.\r\n\r\nFrom an examination of the Teutonic words for "temple" Grimm has\r\nmade it probable that amongst the Germans the oldest sanctuaries\r\nwere natural woods. However that may be, tree-worship is well\r\nattested for all the great European families of the Aryan stock.\r\nAmongst the Celts the oak-worship of the Druids is familiar to every\r\none, and their old word for sanctuary seems to be identical in\r\norigin and meaning with the Latin _nemus,_ a grove or woodland\r\nglade, which still survives in the name of Nemi. Sacred groves were\r\ncommon among the ancient Germans, and tree-worship is hardly extinct\r\namongst their descendants at the present day. How serious that\r\nworship was in former times may be gathered from the ferocious\r\npenalty appointed by the old German laws for such as dared to peel\r\nthe bark of a standing tree. The culprit\'s navel was to be cut out\r\nand nailed to the part of the tree which he had peeled, and he was\r\nto be driven round and round the tree till all his guts were wound\r\nabout its trunk. The intention of the punishment clearly was to\r\nreplace the dead bark by a living substitute taken from the culprit;\r\nit was a life for a life, the life of a man for the life of a tree.\r\nAt Upsala, the old religious capital of Sweden, there was a sacred\r\ngrove in which every tree was regarded as divine. The heathen Slavs\r\nworshipped trees and groves. The Lithuanians were not converted to\r\nChristianity till towards the close of the fourteenth century, and\r\namongst them at the date of their conversion the worship of trees\r\nwas prominent. Some of them revered remarkable oaks and other great\r\nshady trees, from which they received oracular responses. Some\r\nmaintained holy groves about their villages or houses, where even to\r\nbreak a twig would have been a sin. They thought that he who cut a\r\nbough in such a grove either died suddenly or was crippled in one of\r\nhis limbs. Proofs of the prevalence of tree-worship in ancient\r\nGreece and Italy are abundant. In the sanctuary of Aesculapius at\r\nCos, for example, it was forbidden to cut down the cypress-trees\r\nunder a penalty of a thousand drachms. But nowhere, perhaps, in the\r\nancient world was this antique form of religion better preserved\r\nthan in the heart of the great metropolis itself. In the Forum, the\r\nbusy centre of Roman life, the sacred fig-tree of Romulus was\r\nworshipped down to the days of the empire, and the withering of its\r\ntrunk was enough to spread consternation through the city. Again, on\r\nthe slope of the Palatine Hill grew a cornel-tree which was esteemed\r\none of the most sacred objects in Rome. Whenever the tree appeared\r\nto a passer-by to be drooping, he set up a hue and cry which was\r\nechoed by the people in the street, and soon a crowd might be seen\r\nrunning helter-skelter from all sides with buckets of water, as if\r\n(says Plutarch) they were hastening to put out a fire.\r\n\r\nAmong the tribes of the Finnish-Ugrian stock in Europe the heathen\r\nworship was performed for the most part in sacred groves, which were\r\nalways enclosed with a fence. Such a grove often consisted merely of\r\na glade or clearing with a few trees dotted about, upon which in\r\nformer times the skins of the sacrificial victims were hung. The\r\ncentral point of the grove, at least among the tribes of the Volga,\r\nwas the sacred tree, beside which everything else sank into\r\ninsignificance. Before it the worshippers assembled and the priest\r\noffered his prayers, at its roots the victim was sacrificed, and its\r\nboughs sometimes served as a pulpit. No wood might be hewn and no\r\nbranch broken in the grove, and women were generally forbidden to\r\nenter it.\r\n\r\nBut it is necessary to examine in some detail the notions on which\r\nthe worship of trees and plants is based. To the savage the world in\r\ngeneral is animate, and trees and plants are no exception to the\r\nrule. He thinks that they have souls like his own, and he treats\r\nthem accordingly. "They say," writes the ancient vegetarian\r\nPorphyry, "that primitive men led an unhappy life, for their\r\nsuperstition did not stop at animals but extended even to plants.\r\nFor why should the slaughter of an ox or a sheep be a greater wrong\r\nthan the felling of a fir or an oak, seeing that a soul is implanted\r\nin these trees also?" Similarly, the Hidatsa Indians of North\r\nAmerica believe that every natural object has its spirit, or to\r\nspeak more properly, its shade. To these shades some consideration\r\nor respect is due, but not equally to all. For example, the shade of\r\nthe cottonwood, the greatest tree in the valley of the Upper\r\nMissouri, is supposed to possess an intelligence which, if properly\r\napproached, may help the Indians in certain undertakings; but the\r\nshades of shrubs and grasses are of little account. When the\r\nMissouri, swollen by a freshet in spring, carries away part of its\r\nbanks and sweeps some tall tree into its current, it is said that\r\nthe spirit of the tree cries, while the roots still cling to the\r\nland and until the trunk falls with a splash into the stream.\r\nFormerly the Indians considered it wrong to fell one of these\r\ngiants, and when large logs were needed they made use only of trees\r\nwhich had fallen of themselves. Till lately some of the more\r\ncredulous old men declared that many of the misfortunes of their\r\npeople were caused by this modern disregard for the rights of the\r\nliving cottonwood. The Iroquois believed that each species of tree,\r\nshrub, plant, and herb had its own spirit, and to these spirits it\r\nwas their custom to return thanks. The Wanika of Eastern Africa\r\nfancy that every tree, and especially every coco-nut tree, has its\r\nspirit; "the destruction of a cocoa-nut tree is regarded as\r\nequivalent to matricide, because that tree gives them life and\r\nnourishment, as a mother does her child." Siamese monks, believing\r\nthat there are souls everywhere, and that to destroy anything\r\nwhatever is forcibly to dispossess a soul, will not break a branch\r\nof a tree, "as they will not break the arm of an innocent person."\r\nThese monks, of course, are Buddhists. But Buddhist animism is not a\r\nphilosophical theory. It is simply a common savage dogma\r\nincorporated in the system of an historical religion. To suppose,\r\nwith Benfey and others, that the theories of animism and\r\ntransmigration current among rude peoples of Asia are derived from\r\nBuddhism, is to reverse the facts.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is only particular sorts of trees that are supposed to\r\nbe tenanted by spirits. At Grbalj in Dalmatia it is said that among\r\ngreat beeches, oaks, and other trees there are some that are endowed\r\nwith shades or souls, and whoever fells one of them must die on the\r\nspot, or at least live an invalid for the rest of his days. If a\r\nwoodman fears that a tree which he has felled is one of this sort,\r\nhe must cut off the head of a live hen on the stump of the tree with\r\nthe very same axe with which he cut down the tree. This will protect\r\nhim from all harm, even if the tree be one of the animated kind. The\r\nsilk-cotton trees, which rear their enormous trunks to a stupendous\r\nheight, far out-topping all the other trees of the forest, are\r\nregarded with reverence throughout West Africa, from the Senegal to\r\nthe Niger, and are believed to be the abode of a god or spirit.\r\nAmong the Ewespeaking peoples of the Slave Coast the indwelling god\r\nof this giant of the forest goes by the name of Huntin. Trees in\r\nwhich he specially dwells--for it is not every silk-cotton tree that\r\nhe thus honours--are surrounded by a girdle of palm-leaves; and\r\nsacrifices of fowls, and occasionally of human beings, are fastened\r\nto the trunk or laid against the foot of the tree. A tree\r\ndistinguished by a girdle of palm-leaves may not be cut down or\r\ninjured in any way; and even silk-cotton trees which are not\r\nsupposed to be animated by Huntin may not be felled unless the\r\nwoodman first offers a sacrifice of fowls and palm-oil to purge\r\nhimself of the proposed sacrilege. To omit the sacrifice is an\r\noffence which may be punished with death. Among the Kangra mountains\r\nof the Punjaub a girl used to be annually sacrificed to an old\r\ncedar-tree, the families of the village taking it in turn to supply\r\nthe victim. The tree was cut down not very many years ago.\r\n\r\nIf trees are animate, they are necessarily sensitive and the cutting\r\nof them down becomes a delicate surgical operation, which must be\r\nperformed with as tender a regard as possible for the feelings of\r\nthe sufferers, who otherwise may turn and rend the careless or\r\nbungling operator. When an oak is being felled "it gives a kind of\r\nshriekes or groanes, that may be heard a mile off, as if it were the\r\ngenius of the oake lamenting. E. Wyld, Esq., hath heard it severall\r\ntimes." The Ojebways "very seldom cut down green or living trees,\r\nfrom the idea that it puts them to pain, and some of their\r\nmedicine-men profess to have heard the wailing of the trees under\r\nthe axe." Trees that bleed and utter cries of pain or indignation\r\nwhen they are hacked or burned occur very often in Chinese books,\r\neven in Standard Histories. Old peasants in some parts of Austria\r\nstill believe that forest-trees are animate, and will not allow an\r\nincision to be made in the bark without special cause; they have\r\nheard from their fathers that the tree feels the cut not less than a\r\nwounded man his hurt. In felling a tree they beg its pardon. It is\r\nsaid that in the Upper Palatinate also old woodmen still secretly\r\nask a fine, sound tree to forgive them before they cut it down. So\r\nin Jarkino the woodman craves pardon of the tree he fells. Before\r\nthe Ilocanes of Luzon cut down trees in the virgin forest or on the\r\nmountains, they recite some verses to the following effect: "Be not\r\nuneasy, my friend, though we fell what we have been ordered to\r\nfell." This they do in order not to draw down on themselves the\r\nhatred of the spirits who live in the trees, and who are apt to\r\navenge themselves by visiting with grievous sickness such as injure\r\nthem wantonly. The Basoga of Central Africa think that, when a tree\r\nis cut down, the angry spirit which inhabits it may cause the death\r\nof the chief and his family. To prevent this disaster they consult a\r\nmedicine-man before they fell a tree. If the man of skill gives\r\nleave to proceed, the woodman first offers a fowl and a goat to the\r\ntree; then as soon as he has given the first blow with the axe, he\r\napplies his mouth to the cut and sucks some of the sap. In this way\r\nhe forms a brotherhood with the tree, just as two men become\r\nblood-brothers by sucking each other\'s blood. After that he can cut\r\ndown his tree-brother with impunity.\r\n\r\nBut the spirits of vegetation are not always treated with deference\r\nand respect. If fair words and kind treatment do not move them,\r\nstronger measures are sometimes resorted to. The durian-tree of the\r\nEast Indies, whose smooth stem often shoots up to a height of eighty\r\nor ninety feet without sending out a branch, bears a fruit of the\r\nmost delicious flavour and the most disgusting stench. The Malays\r\ncultivate the tree for the sake of its fruit, and have been known to\r\nresort to a peculiar ceremony for the purpose of stimulating its\r\nfertility. Near Jugra in Selangor there is a small grove of\r\ndurian-trees, and on a specially chosen day the villagers used to\r\nassemble in it. Thereupon one of the local sorcerers would take a\r\nhatchet and deliver several shrewd blows on the trunk of the most\r\nbarren of the trees, saying, "Will you now bear fruit or not? If you\r\ndo not, I shall fell you." To this the tree replied through the\r\nmouth of another man who had climbed a mangostin-tree hard by (the\r\ndurian-tree being unclimbable), "Yes, I will now bear fruit; I beg\r\nof you not to fell me." So in Japan to make trees bear fruit two men\r\ngo into an orchard. One of them climbs up a tree and the other\r\nstands at the foot with an axe. The man with the axe asks the tree\r\nwhether it will yield a good crop next year and threatens to cut it\r\ndown if it does not. To this the man among the branches replies on\r\nbehalf of the tree that it will bear abundantly. Odd as this mode of\r\nhorticulture may seem to us, it has its exact parallels in Europe.\r\nOn Christmas Eve many a South Slavonian and Bulgarian peasant swings\r\nan axe threateningly against a barren fruit-tree, while another man\r\nstanding by intercedes for the menaced tree, saying, "Do not cut it\r\ndown; it will soon bear fruit." Thrice the axe is swung, and thrice\r\nthe impending blow is arrested at the entreaty of the intercessor.\r\nAfter that the frightened tree will certainly bear fruit next year.\r\n\r\nThe conception of trees and plants as animated beings naturally\r\nresults in treating them as male and female, who can be married to\r\neach other in a real, and not merely a figurative or poetical, sense\r\nof the word. The notion is not purely fanciful, for plants like\r\nanimals have their sexes and reproduce their kind by the union of\r\nthe male and female elements. But whereas in all the higher animals\r\nthe organs of the two sexes are regularly separated between\r\ndifferent individuals, in most plants they exist together in every\r\nindividual of the species. This rule, however, is by no means\r\nuniversal, and in many species the male plant is distinct from the\r\nfemale. The distinction appears to have been observed by some\r\nsavages, for we are told that the Maoris "are acquainted with the\r\nsex of trees, etc., and have distinct names for the male and female\r\nof some trees." The ancients knew the difference between the male\r\nand the female date-palm, and fertilised them artificially by\r\nshaking the pollen of the male tree over the flowers of the female.\r\nThe fertilisation took place in spring. Among the heathen of Harran\r\nthe month during which the palms were fertilised bore the name of\r\nthe Date Month, and at this time they celebrated the marriage\r\nfestival of all the gods and goddesses. Different from this true and\r\nfruitful marriage of the palm are the false and barren marriages of\r\nplants which play a part in Hindoo superstition. For example, if a\r\nHindoo has planted a grove of mangos, neither he nor his wife may\r\ntaste of the fruit until he has formally married one of the trees,\r\nas a bridegroom, to a tree of a different sort, commonly a\r\ntamarind-tree, which grows near it in the grove. If there is no\r\ntamarind to act as bride, a jasmine will serve the turn. The\r\nexpenses of such a marriage are often considerable, for the more\r\nBrahmans are feasted at it, the greater the glory of the owner of\r\nthe grove. A family has been known to sell its golden and silver\r\ntrinkets, and to borrow all the money they could in order to marry a\r\nmango-tree to a jasmine with due pomp and ceremony. On Christmas Eve\r\nGerman peasants used to tie fruit-trees together with straw ropes to\r\nmake them bear fruit, saying that the trees were thus married.\r\n\r\nIn the Moluccas, when the clove-trees are in blossom, they are\r\ntreated like pregnant women. No noise may be made near them; no\r\nlight or fire may be carried past them at night; no one may approach\r\nthem with his hat on, all must uncover in their presence. These\r\nprecautions are observed lest the tree should be alarmed and bear no\r\nfruit, or should drop its fruit too soon, like the untimely delivery\r\nof a woman who has been frightened in her pregnancy. So in the East\r\nthe growing rice-crop is often treated with the same considerate\r\nregard as a breeding woman. Thus in Amboyna, when the rice is in\r\nbloom, the people say that it is pregnant and fire no guns and make\r\nno other noises near the field, for fear lest, if the rice were thus\r\ndisturbed, it would miscarry, and the crop would be all straw and no\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is the souls of the dead which are believed to animate\r\ntrees. The Dieri tribe of Central Australia regard as very sacred\r\ncertain trees which are supposed to be their fathers transformed;\r\nhence they speak with reverence of these trees, and are careful that\r\nthey shall not be cut down or burned. If the settlers require them\r\nto hew down the trees, they earnestly protest against it, asserting\r\nthat were they to do so they would have no luck, and might be\r\npunished for not protecting their ancestors. Some of the Philippine\r\nIslanders believe that the souls of their ancestors are in certain\r\ntrees, which they therefore spare. If they are obliged to fell one\r\nof these trees, they excuse themselves to it by saying that it was\r\nthe priest who made them do it. The spirits take up their abode, by\r\npreference, in tall and stately trees with great spreading branches.\r\nWhen the wind rustles the leaves, the natives fancy it is the voice\r\nof the spirit; and they never pass near one of these trees without\r\nbowing respectfully, and asking pardon of the spirit for disturbing\r\nhis repose. Among the Ignorrotes, every village has its sacred tree,\r\nin which the souls of the dead forefathers of the hamlet reside.\r\nOfferings are made to the tree, and any injury done to it is\r\nbelieved to entail some misfortune on the village. Were the tree cut\r\ndown, the village and all its inhabitants would inevitably perish.\r\n\r\nIn Corea the souls of people who die of the plague or by the\r\nroadside, and of women who expire in childbirth, invariably take up\r\ntheir abode in trees. To such spirits offerings of cake, wine, and\r\npork are made on heaps of stones piled under the trees. In China it\r\nhas been customary from time immemorial to plant trees on graves in\r\norder thereby to strengthen the soul of the deceased and thus to\r\nsave his body from corruption; and as the evergreen cypress and pine\r\nare deemed to be fuller of vitality than other trees, they have been\r\nchosen by preference for this purpose. Hence the trees that grow on\r\ngraves are sometimes identified with the souls of the departed.\r\nAmong the Miao-Kia, an aboriginal race of Southern and Western\r\nChina, a sacred tree stands at the entrance of every village, and\r\nthe inhabitants believe that it is tenanted by the soul of their\r\nfirst ancestor and that it rules their destiny. Sometimes there is a\r\nsacred grove near a village, where the trees are suffered to rot and\r\ndie on the spot. Their fallen branches cumber the ground, and no one\r\nmay remove them unless he has first asked leave of the spirit of the\r\ntree and offered him a sacrifice. Among the Maraves of Southern\r\nAfrica the burial-ground is always regarded as a holy place where\r\nneither a tree may be felled nor a beast killed, because everything\r\nthere is supposed to be tenanted by the souls of the dead.\r\n\r\nIn most, if not all, of these cases the spirit is viewed as\r\nincorporate in the tree; it animates the tree and must suffer and\r\ndie with it. But, according to another and probably later opinion,\r\nthe tree is not the body, but merely the abode of the tree-spirit,\r\nwhich can quit it and return to it at pleasure. The inhabitants of\r\nSiaoo, an East Indian island, believe in certain sylvan spirits who\r\ndwell in forests or in great solitary trees. At full moon the spirit\r\ncomes forth from his lurking-place and roams about. He has a big\r\nhead, very long arms and legs, and a ponderous body. In order to\r\npropitiate the wood-spirits people bring offerings of food, fowls,\r\ngoats, and so forth to the places which they are supposed to haunt.\r\nThe people of Nias think that, when a tree dies, its liberated\r\nspirit becomes a demon, which can kill a coco-nut palm by merely\r\nlighting on its branches, and can cause the death of all the\r\nchildren in a house by perching on one of the posts that support it.\r\nFurther, they are of opinion that certain trees are at all times\r\ninhabited by roving demons who, if the trees were damaged, would be\r\nset free to go about on errands of mischief. Hence the people\r\nrespect these trees, and are careful not to cut them down.\r\n\r\nNot a few ceremonies observed at cutting down haunted trees are\r\nbased on the belief that the spirits have it in their power to quit\r\nthe trees at pleasure or in case of need. Thus when the Pelew\r\nIslanders are felling a tree, they conjure the spirit of the tree to\r\nleave it and settle on another. The wily negro of the Slave Coast,\r\nwho wishes to fell an _ashorin_ tree, but knows that he cannot do it\r\nso long as the spirit remains in the tree, places a little palm-oil\r\non the ground as a bait, and then, when the unsuspecting spirit has\r\nquitted the tree to partake of this dainty, hastens to cut down its\r\nlate abode. When the Toboongkoos of Celebes are about to clear a\r\npiece of forest in order to plant rice, they build a tiny house and\r\nfurnish it with tiny clothes and some food and gold. Then they call\r\ntogether all the spirits of the wood, offer them the little house\r\nwith its contents, and beseech them to quit the spot. After that\r\nthey may safely cut down the wood without fearing to wound\r\nthemselves in so doing. Before the Tomori, another tribe of Celebes,\r\nfell a tall tree they lay a quid of betel at its foot, and invite\r\nthe spirit who dwells in the tree to change his lodging; moreover,\r\nthey set a little ladder against the trunk to enable him to descend\r\nwith safety and comfort. The Mandelings of Sumatra endeavour to lay\r\nthe blame of all such misdeeds at the door of the Dutch authorities.\r\nThus when a man is cutting a road through a forest and has to fell a\r\ntall tree which blocks the way, he will not begin to ply his axe\r\nuntil he has said: "Spirit who lodgest in this tree, take it not ill\r\nthat I cut down thy dwelling, for it is done at no wish of mine but\r\nby order of the Controller." And when he wishes to clear a piece of\r\nforest-land for cultivation, it is necessary that he should come to\r\na satisfactory understanding with the woodland spirits who live\r\nthere before he lays low their leafy dwellings. For this purpose he\r\ngoes to the middle of the plot of ground, stoops down, and pretends\r\nto pick up a letter. Then unfolding a bit of paper he reads aloud an\r\nimaginary letter from the Dutch Government, in which he is strictly\r\nenjoined to set about clearing the land without delay. Having done\r\nso, he says: "You hear that, spirits. I must begin clearing at once,\r\nor I shall be hanged."\r\n\r\nEven when a tree has been felled, sawn into planks, and used to\r\nbuild a house, it is possible that the woodland spirit may still be\r\nlurking in the timber, and accordingly some people seek to\r\npropitiate him before or after they occupy the new house. Hence,\r\nwhen a new dwelling is ready the Toradjas of Celebes kill a goat, a\r\npig, or a buffalo, and smear all the woodwork with its blood. If the\r\nbuilding is a _lobo_ or spirit-house, a fowl or a dog is killed on\r\nthe ridge of the roof, and its blood allowed to flow down on both\r\nsides. The ruder Tonapoo in such a case sacrifice a human being on\r\nthe roof. This sacrifice on the roof of a _lobo_ or temple serves\r\nthe same purpose as the smearing of blood on the woodwork of an\r\nordinary house. The intention is to propitiate the forest-spirits\r\nwho may still be in the timber; they are thus put in good humour and\r\nwill do the inmates of the house no harm. For a like reason people\r\nin Celebes and the Moluccas are much afraid of planting a post\r\nupside down at the building of a house; for the forest-spirit, who\r\nmight still be in the timber, would very naturally resent the\r\nindignity and visit the inmates with sickness. The Kayans of Borneo\r\nare of opinion that tree-spirits stand very stiffly on the point of\r\nhonour and visit men with their displeasure for any injury done to\r\nthem. Hence after building a house, whereby they have been forced to\r\nill-treat many trees, these people observe a period of penance for a\r\nyear during which they must abstain from many things, such as the\r\nkilling of bears, tiger-cats, and serpents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Beneficent Powers of Tree-Spirits\r\n\r\nWHEN a tree comes to be viewed, no longer as the body of the\r\ntree-spirit, but simply as its abode which it can quit at pleasure,\r\nan important advance has been made in religious thought. Animism is\r\npassing into polytheism. In other words, instead of regarding each\r\ntree as a living and conscious being, man now sees in it merely a\r\nlifeless, inert mass, tenanted for a longer or shorter time by a\r\nsupernatural being who, as he can pass freely from tree to tree,\r\nthereby enjoys a certain right of possession or lordship over the\r\ntrees, and, ceasing to be a tree-soul, becomes a forest god. As soon\r\nas the tree-spirit is thus in a measure disengaged from each\r\nparticular tree, he begins to change his shape and assume the body\r\nof a man, in virtue of a general tendency of early thought to clothe\r\nall abstract spiritual beings in concrete human form. Hence in\r\nclassical art the sylvan deities are depicted in human shape, their\r\nwoodland character being denoted by a branch or some equally obvious\r\nsymbol. But this change of shape does not affect the essential\r\ncharacter of the tree-spirit. The powers which he exercised as a\r\ntree-soul incorporate in a tree, he still continues to wield as a\r\ngod of trees. This I shall now attempt to prove in detail. I shall\r\nshow, first, that trees considered as animate beings are credited\r\nwith the power of making the rain to fall, the sun to shine, flocks\r\nand herds to multiply, and women to bring forth easily; and, second,\r\nthat the very same powers are attributed to tree-gods conceived as\r\nanthropomorphic beings or as actually incarnate in living men.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, trees or tree-spirits are believed to give rain and\r\nsunshine. When the missionary Jerome of Prague was persuading the\r\nheathen Lithuanians to fell their sacred groves, a multitude of\r\nwomen besought the Prince of Lithuania to stop him, saying that with\r\nthe woods he was destroying the house of god from which they had\r\nbeen wont to get rain and sunshine. The Mundaris in Assam think that\r\nif a tree in the sacred grove is felled the sylvan gods evince their\r\ndispleasure by withholding rain. In order to procure rain the\r\ninhabitants of Monyo, a village in the Sagaing district of Upper\r\nBurma, chose the largest tamarind-tree near the village and named it\r\nthe haunt of the spirit (_nat_) who controls the rain. Then they\r\noffered bread, coco-nuts, plantains, and fowls to the guardian\r\nspirit of the village and to the spirit who gives rain, and they\r\nprayed, "O Lord _nat_ have pity on us poor mortals, and stay not the\r\nrain. Inasmuch as our offering is given ungrudgingly, let the rain\r\nfall day and night." Afterwards libations were made in honour of the\r\nspirit of the tamarind-tree; and still later three elderly women,\r\ndressed in fine clothes and wearing necklaces and earrings, sang the\r\nRain Song.\r\n\r\nAgain, tree-spirits make the crops to grow. Amongst the Mundaris\r\nevery village has its sacred grove, and "the grove deities are held\r\nresponsible for the crops, and are especially honoured at all the\r\ngreat agricultural festivals." The negroes of the Gold Coast are in\r\nthe habit of sacrificing at the foot of certain tall trees, and they\r\nthink that if one of these were felled all the fruits of the earth\r\nwould perish. The Gallas dance in couples round sacred trees,\r\npraying for a good harvest. Every couple consists of a man and\r\nwoman, who are linked together by a stick, of which each holds one\r\nend. Under their arms they carry green corn or grass. Swedish\r\npeasants stick a leafy branch in each furrow of their corn-fields,\r\nbelieving that this will ensure an abundant crop. The same idea\r\ncomes out in the German and French custom of the Harvest-May. This\r\nis a large branch or a whole tree, which is decked with ears of\r\ncorn, brought home on the last waggon from the harvest-field, and\r\nfastened on the roof of the farmhouse or of the barn, where it\r\nremains for a year. Mannhardt has proved that this branch or tree\r\nembodies the tree-spirit conceived as the spirit of vegetation in\r\ngeneral, whose vivifying and fructifying influence is thus brought\r\nto bear upon the corn in particular. Hence in Swabia the Harvest-May\r\nis fastened amongst the last stalks of corn left standing on the\r\nfield; in other places it is planted on the corn-field and the last\r\nsheaf cut is attached to its trunk.\r\n\r\nAgain, the tree-spirit makes the herds to multiply and blesses women\r\nwith offspring. In Northern India the _Emblica officinalis_ is a\r\nsacred tree. On the eleventh of the month Phalgun (February)\r\nlibations are poured at the foot of the tree, a red or yellow string\r\nis bound about the trunk, and prayers are offered to it for the\r\nfruitfulness of women, animals, and crops. Again, in Northern India\r\nthe coco-nut is esteemed one of the most sacred fruits, and is\r\ncalled Sriphala, or the fruit of Sri, the goddess of prosperity. It\r\nis the symbol of fertility, and all through Upper India is kept in\r\nshrines and presented by the priests to women who desire to become\r\nmothers. In the town of Qua, near Old Calabar, there used to grow a\r\npalm-tree which ensured conception to any barren woman who ate a nut\r\nfrom its branches. In Europe the May-tree or May-pole is apparently\r\nsupposed to possess similar powers over both women and cattle. Thus\r\nin some parts of Germany on the first of May the peasants set up\r\nMay-trees or May-bushes at the doors of stables and byres, one for\r\neach horse and cow; this is thought to make the cows yield much\r\nmilk. Of the Irish we are told that "they fancy a green bough of a\r\ntree, fastened on May-day against the house, will produce plenty of\r\nmilk that summer."\r\n\r\nOn the second of July some of the Wends used to set up an oak-tree\r\nin the middle of the village with an iron cock fastened to its top;\r\nthen they danced round it, and drove the cattle round it to make\r\nthem thrive. The Circassians regard the pear-tree as the protector\r\nof cattle. So they cut down a young pear-tree in the forest, branch\r\nit, and carry it home, where it is adored as a divinity. Almost\r\nevery house has one such pear-tree. In autumn, on the day of the\r\nfestival, the tree is carried into the house with great ceremony to\r\nthe sound of music and amid the joyous cries of all the inmates, who\r\ncompliment it on its fortunate arrival. It is covered with candles,\r\nand a cheese is fastened to its top. Round about it they eat, drink,\r\nand sing. Then they bid the tree good-bye and take it back to the\r\ncourtyard, where it remains for the rest of the year, set up against\r\nthe wall, without receiving any mark of respect.\r\n\r\nIn the Tuhoe tribe of Maoris "the power of making women fruitful is\r\nascribed to trees. These trees are associated with the navel-strings\r\nof definite mythical ancestors, as indeed the navel-strings of all\r\nchildren used to be hung upon them down to quite recent times. A\r\nbarren woman had to embrace such a tree with her arms, and she\r\nreceived a male or a female child according as she embraced the east\r\nor the west side." The common European custom of placing a green\r\nbush on May Day before or on the house of a beloved maiden probably\r\noriginated in the belief of the fertilising power of the\r\ntree-spirit. In some parts of Bavaria such bushes are set up also at\r\nthe houses of newly-married pairs, and the practice is only omitted\r\nif the wife is near her confinement; for in that case they say that\r\nthe husband has "set up a May-bush for himself." Among the South\r\nSlavonians a barren woman, who desires to have a child, places a new\r\nchemise upon a fruitful tree on the eve of St. George\'s Day. Next\r\nmorning before sunrise she examines the garment, and if she finds\r\nthat some living creature has crept on it, she hopes that her wish\r\nwill be fulfilled within the year. Then she puts on the chemise,\r\nconfident that she will be as fruitful as the tree on which the\r\ngarment has passed the night. Among the Kara-Kirghiz barren women\r\nroll themselves on the ground under a solitary apple-tree, in order\r\nto obtain offspring. Lastly, the power of granting to women an easy\r\ndelivery at child-birth is ascribed to trees both in Sweden and\r\nAfrica. In some districts of Sweden there was formerly a _bardtr\xe4d_\r\nor guardian-tree (lime, ash, or elm) in the neighbourhood of every\r\nfarm. No one would pluck a single leaf of the sacred tree, any\r\ninjury to which was punished by ill-luck or sickness. Pregnant women\r\nused to clasp the tree in their arms in order to ensure an easy\r\ndelivery. In some negro tribes of the Congo region pregnant women\r\nmake themselves garments out of the bark of a certain sacred tree,\r\nbecause they believe that this tree delivers them from the dangers\r\nthat attend child-bearing. The story that Leto clasped a palm-tree\r\nand an olive-tree or two laurel-trees, when she was about to give\r\nbirth to the divine twins Apollo and Artemis, perhaps points to a\r\nsimilar Greek belief in the efficacy of certain trees to facilitate\r\ndelivery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. Relics of Tree Worship in Modern Europe\r\n\r\nFROM THE FOREGOING review of the beneficent qualities commonly\r\nascribed to tree-spirits, it is easy to understand why customs like\r\nthe May-tree or May-pole have prevailed so widely and figured so\r\nprominently in the popular festivals of European peasants. In spring\r\nor early summer or even on Midsummer Day, it was and still is in\r\nmany parts of Europe the custom to go out to the woods, cut down a\r\ntree and bring it into the village, where it is set up amid general\r\nrejoicings; or the people cut branches in the woods, and fasten them\r\non every house. The intention of these customs is to bring home to\r\nthe village, and to each house, the blessings which the tree-spirit\r\nhas in its power to bestow. Hence the custom in some places of\r\nplanting a May-tree before every house, or of carrying the village\r\nMay-tree from door to door, that every household may receive its\r\nshare of the blessing. Out of the mass of evidence on this subject a\r\nfew examples may be selected.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Piers, in his _Description of Westmeath,_ writing in 1682\r\nsays: "On May-eve, every family sets up before their door a green\r\nbush, strewed over with yellow flowers, which the meadows yield\r\nplentifully. In countries where timber is plentiful, they erect tall\r\nslender trees, which stand high, and they continue almost the whole\r\nyear; so as a stranger would go nigh to imagine that they were all\r\nsigns of ale-sellers, and that all houses were ale-houses." In\r\nNorthamptonshire a young tree ten or twelve feet high used to be\r\nplanted before each house on May Day so as to appear growing;\r\nflowers were thrown over it and strewn about the door. "Among\r\nancient customs still retained by the Cornish, may be reckoned that\r\nof decking their doors and porches on the first of May with green\r\nboughs of sycamore and hawthorn, and of planting trees, or rather\r\nstumps of trees, before their houses." In the north of England it\r\nwas formerly the custom for young people to rise a little after\r\nmidnight on the morning of the first of May, and go out with music\r\nand the blowing of horns into the woods, where they broke branches\r\nand adorned them with nosegays and crowns of flowers. This done,\r\nthey returned about sunrise and fastened the flower-decked branches\r\nover the doors and windows of their houses. At Abingdon in Berkshire\r\nyoung people formerly went about in groups on May morning, singing a\r\ncarol of which the following are two of the verses:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "We\'ve been rambling all the night,\r\n    And sometime of this day;\r\n    And now returning back again,\r\n    We bring a garland gay.\r\n    A garland gay we bring you here;\r\n    And at your door we stand;\r\n    It is a sprout well budded out,\r\n    The work of our Lord\'s hand."\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the towns of Saffron Walden and Debden in Essex on the first of\r\nMay little girls go about in parties from door to door singing a\r\nsong almost identical with the above and carrying garlands; a doll\r\ndressed in white is usually placed in the middle of each garland.\r\nSimilar customs have been and indeed are still observed in various\r\nparts of England. The garlands are generally in the form of hoops\r\nintersecting each other at right angles. It appears that a hoop\r\nwreathed with rowan and marsh marigold, and bearing suspended within\r\nit two balls, is still carried on May Day by villagers in some parts\r\nof Ireland. The balls, which are sometimes covered with gold and\r\nsilver paper, are said to have originally represented the sun and\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nIn some villages of the Vosges Mountains on the first Sunday of May\r\nyoung girls go in bands from house to house, singing a song in\r\npraise of May, in which mention is made of the "bread and meal that\r\ncome in May." If money is given them, they fasten a green bough to\r\nthe door; if it is refused, they wish the family many children and\r\nno bread to feed them. In the French department of Mayenne, boys who\r\nbore the name of _Maillotins_ used to go about from farm to farm on\r\nthe first of May singing carols, for which they received money or a\r\ndrink; they planted a small tree or a branch of a tree. Near Saverne\r\nin Alsace bands of people go about carrying May-trees. Amongst them\r\nis a man dressed in a white shirt with his face blackened; in front\r\nof him is carried a large May-tree, but each member of the band also\r\ncarries a smaller one. One of the company bears a huge basket, in\r\nwhich he collects eggs, bacon, and so forth.\r\n\r\nOn the Thursday before Whitsunday the Russian villagers "go out into\r\nthe woods, sing songs, weave garlands, and cut down a young\r\nbirch-tree, which they dress up in woman\'s clothes, or adorn with\r\nmany-coloured shreds and ribbons. After that comes a feast, at the\r\nend of which they take the dressed-up birch-tree, carry it home to\r\ntheir village with joyful dance and song, and set it up in one of\r\nthe houses, where it remains as an honoured guest till Whitsunday.\r\nOn the two intervening days they pay visits to the house where their\r\n\'guest\' is; but on the third day, Whitsunday, they take her to a\r\nstream and fling her into its waters," throwing their garlands after\r\nher. In this Russian custom the dressing of the birch in woman\'s\r\nclothes shows how clearly the tree is personified; and the throwing\r\nit into a stream is most probably a raincharm.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Sweden on the eve of May Day lads go about carrying\r\neach a bunch of fresh birch twigs wholly or partly in leaf. With the\r\nvillage fiddler at their head, they make the round of the houses\r\nsinging May songs; the burden of their songs is a prayer for fine\r\nweather, a plentiful harvest, and worldly and spiritual blessings.\r\nOne of them carries a basket in which he collects gifts of eggs and\r\nthe like. If they are well received, they stick a leafy twig in the\r\nroof over the cottage door. But in Sweden midsummer is the season\r\nwhen these ceremonies are chiefly observed. On the Eve of St. John\r\n(the twenty-third of June) the houses are thoroughly cleansed and\r\ngarnished with green boughs and flowers. Young fir-trees are raised\r\nat the doorway and elsewhere about the homestead; and very often\r\nsmall umbrageous arbours are constructed in the garden. In Stockholm\r\non this day a leaf-market is held at which thousands of May-poles\r\n(_Maj Stanger_), from six inches to twelve feet high, decorated with\r\nleaves, flowers, slips of coloured paper, gilt egg-shells strung on\r\nreeds, and so on, are exposed for sale. Bonfires are lit on the\r\nhills, and the people dance round them and jump over them. But the\r\nchief event of the day is setting up the May-pole. This consists of\r\na straight and tall sprucepine tree, stripped of its branches. "At\r\ntimes hoops and at others pieces of wood, placed crosswise, are\r\nattached to it at intervals; whilst at others it is provided with\r\nbows, representing, so to say, a man with his arms akimbo. From top\r\nto bottom not only the \'Maj Stang\' (May-pole) itself, but the hoops,\r\nbows, etc., are ornamented with leaves, flowers, slips of various\r\ncloth, gilt egg-shells, etc.; and on the top of it is a large vane,\r\nor it may be a flag." The raising of the May-pole, the decoration of\r\nwhich is done by the village maidens, is an affair of much ceremony;\r\nthe people flock to it from all quarters, and dance round it in a\r\ngreat ring. Midsummer customs of the same sort used to be observed\r\nin some parts of Germany. Thus in the towns of the Upper Harz\r\nMountains tall fir-trees, with the bark peeled off their lower\r\ntrunks, were set up in open places and decked with flowers and eggs,\r\nwhich were painted yellow and red. Round these trees the young folk\r\ndanced by day and the old folk in the evening. In some parts of\r\nBohemia also a May-pole or midsummer-tree is erected on St. John\'s\r\nEve. The lads fetch a tall fir or pine from the wood and set it up\r\non a height, where the girls deck it with nosegays, garlands, and\r\nred ribbons. It is afterwards burned.\r\n\r\nIt would be needless to illustrate at length the custom, which has\r\nprevailed in various parts of Europe, such as England, France, and\r\nGermany, of setting up a village May-tree or May-pole on May Day. A\r\nfew examples will suffice. The puritanical writer Phillip Stubbes in\r\nhis _Anatomie of Abuses,_ first published at London in 1583, has\r\ndescribed with manifest disgust how they used to bring in the\r\nMay-pole in the days of good Queen Bess. His description affords us\r\na vivid glimpse of merry England in the olden time. "Against May,\r\nWhitsonday, or other time, all the yung men and maides, olde men and\r\nwives, run gadding over night to the woods, groves, hils, and\r\nmountains, where they spend all the night in plesant pastimes; and\r\nin the morning they return, bringing with them birch and branches of\r\ntrees, to deck their assemblies withall. And no mervaile, for there\r\nis a great Lord present amongst them, as superintendent and Lord\r\nover their pastimes and sportes, namely, Sathan, prince of hel. But\r\nthe chiefest jewel they bring from thence is their May-pole, which\r\nthey bring home with great veneration, as thus. They have twentie or\r\nfortie yoke of oxen, every oxe having a sweet nose-gay of flouers\r\nplaced on the tip of his hornes, and these oxen drawe home this\r\nMay-pole (this stinkyng ydol, rather), which is covered all over\r\nwith floures and hearbs, bound round about with strings, from the\r\ntop to the bottome, and sometime painted with variable colours, with\r\ntwo or three hundred men, women and children following it with great\r\ndevotion. And thus beeing reared up, with handkercheefs and flags\r\nhovering on the top, they straw the ground rounde about, binde green\r\nboughes about it, set up sommer haules, bowers, and arbors hard by\r\nit. And then fall they to daunce about it, like as the heathen\r\npeople did at the dedication of the Idols, whereof this is a perfect\r\npattern, or rather the thing itself. I have heard it credibly\r\nreported (and that _viva voce_) by men of great gravitie and\r\nreputation, that of fortie, threescore, or a hundred maides going to\r\nthe wood over night, there have scaresly the third part of them\r\nreturned home againe undefiled."\r\n\r\nIn Swabia on the first of May a tall fir-tree used to be fetched\r\ninto the village, where it was decked with ribbons and set up; then\r\nthe people danced round it merrily to music. The tree stood on the\r\nvillage green the whole year through, until a fresh tree was brought\r\nin next May Day. In Saxony "people were not content with bringing\r\nthe summer symbolically (as king or queen) into the village; they\r\nbrought the fresh green itself from the woods even into the houses:\r\nthat is the May or Whitsuntide trees, which are mentioned in\r\ndocuments from the thirteenth century onwards. The fetching in of\r\nthe May-tree was also a festival. The people went out into the woods\r\nto seek the May (_majum quaerere_), brought young trees, especially\r\nfirs and birches, to the village and set them up before the doors of\r\nthe houses or of the cattle-stalls or in the rooms. Young fellows\r\nerected such May-trees, as we have already said, before the chambers\r\nof their sweethearts. Besides these household Mays, a great May-tree\r\nor May-pole, which had also been brought in solemn procession to the\r\nvillage, was set up in the middle of the village or in the\r\nmarket-place of the town. It had been chosen by the whole community,\r\nwho watched over it most carefully. Generally the tree was stripped\r\nof its branches and leaves, nothing but the crown being left, on\r\nwhich were displayed, in addition to many-coloured ribbons and\r\ncloths, a variety of victuals such as sausages, cakes, and eggs. The\r\nyoung folk exerted themselves to obtain these prizes. In the greasy\r\npoles which are still to be seen at our fairs we have a relic of\r\nthese old May-poles. Not uncommonly there was a race on foot or on\r\nhorseback to the May-tree--a Whitsunday pastime which in course of\r\ntime has been divested of its goal and survives as a popular custom\r\nto this day in many parts of Germany." At Bordeaux on the first of\r\nMay the boys of each street used to erect in it a May-pole, which\r\nthey adorned with garlands and a great crown; and every evening\r\nduring the whole of the month the young people of both sexes danced\r\nsinging about the pole. Down to the present day May-trees decked\r\nwith flowers and ribbons are set up on May Day in every village and\r\nhamlet of gay Provence. Under them the young folk make merry and the\r\nold folk rest.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases, apparently, the custom is or was to bring in a\r\nnew May-tree each year. However, in England the village May-pole\r\nseems as a rule, at least in later times, to have been permanent,\r\nnot renewed annually. Villages of Upper Bavaria renew their May-pole\r\nonce every three, four, or five years. It is a fir-tree fetched from\r\nthe forest, and amid all the wreaths, flags, and inscriptions with\r\nwhich it is bedecked, an essential part is the bunch of dark green\r\nfoliage left at the top "as a memento that in it we have to do, not\r\nwith a dead pole, but with a living tree from the greenwood." We can\r\nhardly doubt that originally the practice everywhere was to set up a\r\nnew May-tree every year. As the object of the custom was to bring in\r\nthe fructifying spirit of vegetation, newly awakened in spring, the\r\nend would have been defeated if, instead of a living tree, green and\r\nsappy, an old withered one had been erected year after year or\r\nallowed to stand permanently. When, however, the meaning of the\r\ncustom had been forgotten, and the May-tree was regarded simply as a\r\ncentre for holiday merry-making, people saw no reason for felling a\r\nfresh tree every year, and preferred to let the same tree stand\r\npermanently, only decking it with fresh flowers on May Day. But even\r\nwhen the May-pole had thus become a fixture, the need of giving it\r\nthe appearance of being a green tree, not a dead pole, was sometimes\r\nfelt. Thus at Weverham in Cheshire "are two May-poles, which are\r\ndecorated on this day (May Day) with all due attention to the\r\nancient solemnity; the sides are hung with garlands, and the top\r\nterminated by a birch or other tall slender tree with its leaves on;\r\nthe bark being peeled, and the stem spliced to the pole, so as to\r\ngive the appearance of one tree from the summit." Thus the renewal\r\nof the May-tree is like the renewal of the Harvest-May; each is\r\nintended to secure a fresh portion of the fertilising spirit of\r\nvegetation, and to preserve it throughout the year. But whereas the\r\nefficacy of the Harvest-May is restricted to promoting the growth of\r\nthe crops, that of the May-tree or May-branch extends also, as we\r\nhave seen, to women and cattle. Lastly, it is worth noting that the\r\nold May-tree is sometimes burned at the end of the year. Thus in the\r\ndistrict of Prague young people break pieces of the public May-tree\r\nand place them behind the holy pictures in their rooms, where they\r\nremain till next May Day, and are then burned on the hearth. In\r\nW\xfcrtemberg the bushes which are set up on the houses on Palm Sunday\r\nare sometimes left there for a year and then burnt.\r\n\r\nSo much for the tree-spirit conceived as incorporate or immanent in\r\nthe tree. We have now to show that the tree-spirit is often\r\nconceived and represented as detached from the tree and clothed in\r\nhuman form, and even as embodied in living men or women. The\r\nevidence for this anthropomorphic representation of the tree-spirit\r\nis largely to be found in the popular customs of European peasantry.\r\n\r\nThere is an instructive class of cases in which the tree-spirit is\r\nrepresented simultaneously in vegetable form and in human form,\r\nwhich are set side by side as if for the express purpose of\r\nexplaining each other. In these cases the human representative of\r\nthe tree-spirit is sometimes a doll or puppet, sometimes a living\r\nperson, but whether a puppet or a person, it is placed beside a tree\r\nor bough; so that together the person or puppet, and the tree or\r\nbough, form a sort of bilingual inscription, the one being, so to\r\nspeak, a translation of the other. Here, therefore, there is no room\r\nleft for doubt that the spirit of the tree is actually represented\r\nin human form. Thus in Bohemia, on the fourth Sunday in Lent, young\r\npeople throw a puppet called Death into the water; then the girls go\r\ninto the wood, cut down a young tree, and fasten to it a puppet\r\ndressed in white clothes to look like a woman; with this tree and\r\npuppet they go from house to house collecting gratuities and singing\r\nsongs with the refrain:\r\n\r\n\r\n    "We carry Death out of the village,\r\n     We bring Summer into the village."\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, as we shall see later on, the "Summer" is the spirit of\r\nvegetation returning or reviving in spring. In some parts of our own\r\ncountry children go about asking for pence with some small\r\nimitations of May-poles, and with a finely-dressed doll which they\r\ncall the Lady of the May. In these cases the tree and the puppet are\r\nobviously regarded as equivalent.\r\n\r\nAt Thann, in Alsace, a girl called the Little May Rose, dressed in\r\nwhite, carries a small May-tree, which is gay with garlands and\r\nribbons. Her companions collect gifts from door to door, singing a\r\nsong:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "Little May Rose turn round three times,\r\n    Let us look at you round and round!\r\n    Rose of the May, come to the greenwood away,\r\n    We will be merry all.\r\n    So we go from the May to the roses."\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of the song a wish is expressed that those who give\r\nnothing may lose their fowls by the marten, that their vine may bear\r\nno clusters, their tree no nuts, their field no corn; the produce of\r\nthe year is supposed to depend on the gifts offered to these May\r\nsingers. Here and in the cases mentioned above, where children go\r\nabout with green boughs or garlands on May Day singing and\r\ncollecting money, the meaning is that with the spirit of vegetation\r\nthey bring plenty and good luck to the house, and they expect to be\r\npaid for the service. In Russian Lithuania, on the first of May,\r\nthey used to set up a green tree before the village. Then the rustic\r\nswains chose the prettiest girl, crowned her, swathed her in birch\r\nbranches and set her beside the May-tree, where they danced, sang,\r\nand shouted "O May! O May!" In Brie (Isle de France) a May-tree is\r\nerected in the midst of the village; its top is crowned with\r\nflowers; lower down it is twined with leaves and twigs, still lower\r\nwith huge green branches. The girls dance round it, and at the same\r\ntime a lad wrapt in leaves and called Father May is led about. In\r\nthe small towns of the Franken Wald mountains in Northern Bavaria,\r\non the second of May, a _Walber_ tree is erected before a tavern,\r\nand a man dances round it, enveloped in straw from head to foot in\r\nsuch a way that the ears of corn unite above his head to form a\r\ncrown. He is called the _Walber,_ and used to be led in procession\r\nthrough the streets, which were adorned with sprigs of birch.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Slavs of Carinthia, on St. George\'s Day (the twentythird\r\nof April), the young people deck with flowers and garlands a tree\r\nwhich has been felled on the eve of the festival. The tree is then\r\ncarried in procession, accompanied with music and joyful\r\nacclamations, the chief figure in the procession being the Green\r\nGeorge, a young fellow clad from head to foot in green birch\r\nbranches. At the close of the ceremonies the Green George, that is\r\nan effigy of him, is thrown into the water. It is the aim of the lad\r\nwho acts Green George to step out of his leafy envelope and\r\nsubstitute the effigy so adroitly that no one shall perceive the\r\nchange. In many places, however, the lad himself who plays the part\r\nof Green George is ducked in a river or pond, with the express\r\nintention of thus ensuring rain to make the fields and meadows green\r\nin summer. In some places the cattle are crowned and driven from\r\ntheir stalls to the accompaniment of a song:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "Green George we bring,\r\n    Green George we accompany,\r\n    May he feed our herds well.\r\n    If not, to the water with him."\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we see that the same powers of making rain and fostering the\r\ncattle, which are ascribed to the tree-spirit regarded as\r\nincorporate in the tree, are also attributed to the tree-spirit\r\nrepresented by a living man.\r\n\r\nAmong the gypsies of Transylvania and Roumania the festival of Green\r\nGeorge is the chief celebration of spring. Some of them keep it on\r\nEaster Monday, others on St. George\'s Day (the twentythird of\r\nApril). On the eve of the festival a young willow tree is cut down,\r\nadorned with garlands and leaves, and set up in the ground. Women\r\nwith child place one of their garments under the tree, and leave it\r\nthere over night; if next morning they find a leaf of the tree lying\r\non the garment, they know that their delivery will be easy. Sick and\r\nold people go to the tree in the evening, spit on it thrice, and\r\nsay, "You will soon die, but let us live." Next morning the gypsies\r\ngather about the willow. The chief figure of the festival is Green\r\nGeorge, a lad who is concealed from top to toe in green leaves and\r\nblossoms. He throws a few handfuls of grass to the beasts of the\r\ntribe, in order that they may have no lack of fodder throughout the\r\nyear. Then he takes three iron nails, which have lain for three days\r\nand nights in water, and knocks them into the willow; after which he\r\npulls them out and flings them into a running stream to propitiate\r\nthe water-spirits. Finally, a pretence is made of throwing Green\r\nGeorge into the water, but in fact it is only a puppet made of\r\nbranches and leaves which is ducked in the stream. In this version\r\nof the custom the powers of granting an easy delivery to women and\r\nof communicating vital energy to the sick and old are clearly\r\nascribed to the willow; while Green George, the human double of the\r\ntree, bestows food on the cattle, and further ensures the favour of\r\nthe water-spirits by putting them in indirect communication with the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nWithout citing more examples to the same effect, we may sum up the\r\nresults of the preceding pages in the words of Mannhardt: "The\r\ncustoms quoted suffice to establish with certainty the conclusion\r\nthat in these spring processions the spirit of vegetation is often\r\nrepresented both by the May-tree and in addition by a man dressed in\r\ngreen leaves or flowers or by a girl similarly adorned. It is the\r\nsame spirit which animates the tree and is active in the inferior\r\nplants and which we have recognised in the May-tree and the\r\nHarvest-May. Quite consistently the spirit is also supposed to\r\nmanifest his presence in the first flower of spring and reveals\r\nhimself both in a girl representing a May-rose, and also, as giver\r\nof harvest, in the person of the _Walber._ The procession with this\r\nrepresentative of the divinity was supposed to produce the same\r\nbeneficial effects on the fowls, the fruit-trees, and the crops as\r\nthe presence of the deity himself. In other words the mummer was\r\nregarded not as an image but as an actual representative of the\r\nspirit of vegetation; hence the wish expressed by the attendants on\r\nthe May-rose and the May-tree that those who refuse them gifts of\r\neggs, bacon, and so forth, may have no share in the blessings which\r\nit is in the power of the itinerant spirit to bestow. We may\r\nconclude that these begging processions with May-trees or May-boughs\r\nfrom door to door (\'bringing the May or the summer\') had everywhere\r\noriginally a serious and, so to speak, sacramental significance;\r\npeople really believed that the god of growth was present unseen in\r\nthe bough; by the procession he was brought to each house to bestow\r\nhis blessing. The names May, Father May, May Lady, Queen of the May,\r\nby which the anthropomorphic spirit of vegetation is often denoted,\r\nshow that the idea of the spirit of vegetation is blent with a\r\npersonification of the season at which his powers are most\r\nstrikingly manifested."\r\n\r\nSo far we have seen that the tree-spirit or the spirit of vegetation\r\nin general is represented either in vegetable form alone, as by a\r\ntree, bough, or flower; or in vegetable and human form\r\nsimultaneously, as by a tree, bough, or flower in combination with a\r\npuppet or a living person. It remains to show that the\r\nrepresentation of him by a tree, bough, or flower is sometimes\r\nentirely dropped, while the representation of him by a living person\r\nremains. In this case the representative character of the person is\r\ngenerally marked by dressing him or her in leaves or flowers;\r\nsometimes, too, it is indicated by the name he or she bears.\r\n\r\nThus in some parts of Russia on St. George\'s Day (the twenty-third\r\nof April) a youth is dressed out, like our Jack-in-the-Green, with\r\nleaves and flowers. The Slovenes call him the Green George. Holding\r\na lighted torch in one hand and a pie in the other, he goes out to\r\nthe corn-fields, followed by girls singing appropriate songs. A\r\ncircle of brushwood is next lighted, in the middle of which is set\r\nthe pie. All who take part in the ceremony then sit down around the\r\nfire and divide the pie among them. In this custom the Green George\r\ndressed in leaves and flowers is plainly identical with the\r\nsimilarly disguised Green George who is associated with a tree in\r\nthe Carinthian, Transylvanian, and Roumanian customs observed on the\r\nsame day. Again, we saw that in Russia at Whitsuntide a birch-tree\r\nis dressed in woman\'s clothes and set up in the house. Clearly\r\nequivalent to this is the custom observed on Whit-Monday by Russian\r\ngirls in the district of Pinsk. They choose the prettiest of their\r\nnumber, envelop her in a mass of foliage taken from the birch-trees\r\nand maples, and carry her about through the village.\r\n\r\nIn Ruhla as soon as the trees begin to grow green in spring, the\r\nchildren assemble on a Sunday and go out into the woods, where they\r\nchoose one of their playmates to be the Little Leaf Man. They break\r\nbranches from the trees and twine them about the child till only his\r\nshoes peep out from the leafy mantle. Holes are made in it for him\r\nto see through, and two of the children lead the Little Leaf Man\r\nthat he may not stumble or fall. Singing and dancing they take him\r\nfrom house to house, asking for gifts of food such as eggs, cream,\r\nsausages, and cakes. Lastly, they sprinkle the Leaf Man with water\r\nand feast on the food they have collected. In the Fricktal,\r\nSwitzerland, at Whitsuntide boys go out into a wood and swathe one\r\nof their number in leafy boughs. He is called the Whitsuntide-lout,\r\nand being mounted on horseback with a green branch in his hand he is\r\nled back into the village. At the village-well a halt is called and\r\nthe leaf-clad lout is dismounted and ducked in the trough. Thereby\r\nhe acquires the right of sprinkling water on everybody, and he\r\nexercises the right specially on girls and street urchins. The\r\nurchins march before him in bands begging him to give them a\r\nWhitsuntide wetting.\r\n\r\nIn England the best-known example of these leaf-clad mummers is the\r\nJack-in-the-Green, a chimney-sweeper who walks encased in a\r\npyramidal framework of wickerwork, which is covered with holly and\r\nivy, and surmounted by a crown of flowers and ribbons. Thus arrayed\r\nhe dances on May Day at the head of a troop of chimney-sweeps, who\r\ncollect pence. In Fricktal a similar frame of basketwork is called\r\nthe Whitsuntide Basket. As soon as the trees begin to bud, a spot is\r\nchosen in the wood, and here the village lads make the frame with\r\nall secrecy, lest others should forestall them. Leafy branches are\r\ntwined round two hoops, one of which rests on the shoulders of the\r\nwearer, the other encircles his claves; holes are made for his eyes\r\nand mouth; and a large nosegay crowns the whole. In this guise he\r\nappears suddenly in the village at the hour of vespers, preceded by\r\nthree boys blowing on horns made of willow bark. The great object of\r\nhis supporters is to set up the Whitsuntide Basket on the village\r\nwell, and to keep it and him there, despite the efforts of the lads\r\nfrom neighbouring villages, who seek to carry off the Whitsuntide\r\nBasket and set it up on their own well.\r\n\r\nIn the class of cases of which the foregoing are specimens it is\r\nobvious that the leaf-clad person who is led about is equivalent to\r\nthe May-tree, May-bough, or May-doll, which is carried from house to\r\nhouse by children begging. Both are representatives of the\r\nbeneficent spirit of vegetation, whose visit to the house is\r\nrecompensed by a present of money or food.\r\n\r\nOften the leaf-clad person who represents the spirit of vegetation\r\nis known as the king or the queen; thus, for example, he or she is\r\ncalled the May King, Whitsuntide King, Queen of May, and so on.\r\nThese titles, as Mannhardt observes, imply that the spirit\r\nincorporate in vegetation is a ruler, whose creative power extends\r\nfar and wide.\r\n\r\nIn a village near Salzwedel a May-tree is set up at Whitsuntide and\r\nthe boys race to it; he who reaches it first is king; a garland of\r\nflowers is put round his neck and in his hand he carries a May-bush,\r\nwith which, as the procession moves along, he sweeps away the dew.\r\nAt each house they sing a song, wishing the inmates good luck,\r\nreferring to the "black cow in the stall milking white milk, black\r\nhen on the nest laying white eggs," and begging a gift of eggs,\r\nbacon, and so on. At the village of Ellgoth in Silesia a ceremony\r\ncalled the King\'s Race is observed at Whitsuntide. A pole with a\r\ncloth tied to it is set up in a meadow, and the young men ride past\r\nit on horseback, each trying to snatch away the cloth as he gallops\r\nby. The one who succeeds in carrying it off and dipping it in the\r\nneighbouring Oder is proclaimed King. Here the pole is clearly a\r\nsubstitute for a May-tree. In some villages of Brunswick at\r\nWhitsuntide a May King is completely enveloped in a May-bush. In\r\nsome parts of Th\xfcringen also they have a May King at Whitsuntide,\r\nbut he is dressed up rather differently. A frame of wood is made in\r\nwhich a man can stand; it is completely covered with birch boughs\r\nand is surmounted by a crown of birch and flowers, in which a bell\r\nis fastened. This frame is placed in the wood and the May King gets\r\ninto it. The rest go out and look for him, and when they have found\r\nhim they lead him back into the village to the magistrate, the\r\nclergyman, and others, who have to guess who is in the verdurous\r\nframe. If they guess wrong, the May King rings his bell by shaking\r\nhis head, and a forfeit of beer or the like must be paid by the\r\nunsuccessful guesser. At Wahrstedt the boys at Whitsuntide choose by\r\nlot a king and a high-steward. The latter is completely concealed in\r\na May-bush, wears a wooden crown wreathen with flowers, and carries\r\na wooden sword. The king, on the other hand, is only distinguished\r\nby a nosegay in his cap, and a reed, with a red ribbon tied to it,\r\nin his hand. They beg for eggs from house to house, threatening\r\nthat, where none are given, none will be laid by the hens throughout\r\nthe year. In this custom the high-steward appears, for some reason,\r\nto have usurped the insignia of the king. At Hildesheim five or six\r\nyoung fellows go about on the afternoon of Whit-Monday cracking long\r\nwhips in measured time and collecting eggs from the houses. The\r\nchief person of the band is the Leaf King, a lad swathed so\r\ncompletely in birchen twigs that nothing of him can be seen but his\r\nfeet. A huge head-dress of birchen twigs adds to his apparent\r\nstature. In his hand he carries a long crook, with which he tries to\r\ncatch stray dogs and children. In some parts of Bohemia on\r\nWhit-Monday the young fellows disguise themselves in tall caps of\r\nbirch bark adorned with flowers. One of them is dressed as a king\r\nand dragged on a sledge to the village green, and if on the way they\r\npass a pool the sledge is always overturned into it. Arrived at the\r\ngreen they gather round the king; the crier jumps on a stone or\r\nclimbs up a tree and recites lampoons about each house and its\r\ninmates. Afterwards the disguises of bark are stripped off and they\r\ngo about the village in holiday attire, carrying a May-tree and\r\nbegging. Cakes, eggs, and corn are sometimes given them. At\r\nGrossvargula, near Langensalza, in the eighteenth century a Grass\r\nKing used to be led about in procession at Whitsuntide. He was\r\nencased in a pyramid of poplar branches, the top of which was\r\nadorned with a royal crown of branches and flowers. He rode on\r\nhorseback with the leafy pyramid over him, so that its lower end\r\ntouched the ground, and an opening was left in it only for his face.\r\nSurrounded by a cavalcade of young fellows, he rode in procession to\r\nthe town hall, the parsonage, and so on, where they all got a drink\r\nof beer. Then under the seven lindens of the neighbouring\r\nSommerberg, the Grass King was stripped of his green casing; the\r\ncrown was handed to the Mayor, and the branches were stuck in the\r\nflax fields in order to make the flax grow tall. In this last trait\r\nthe fertilising influence ascribed to the representative of the\r\ntree-spirit comes out clearly. In the neighbourhood of Pilsen\r\n(Bohemia) a conical hut of green branches, without any door, is\r\nerected at Whitsuntide in the midst of the village. To this hut\r\nrides a troop of village lads with a king at their head. He wears a\r\nsword at his side and a sugar-loaf hat of rushes on his head. In his\r\ntrain are a judge, a crier, and a personage called the Frog-flayer\r\nor Hangman. This last is a sort of ragged merryandrew, wearing a\r\nrusty old sword and bestriding a sorry hack. On reaching the hut the\r\ncrier dismounts and goes round it looking for a door. Finding none,\r\nhe says, "Ah, this is perhaps an enchanted castle; the witches creep\r\nthrough the leaves and need no door." At last he draws his sword and\r\nhews his way into the hut, where there is a chair, on which he seats\r\nhimself and proceeds to criticise in rhyme the girls, farmers, and\r\nfarm-servants of the neighbourhood. When this is over, the\r\nFrog-flayer steps forward and, after exhibiting a cage with frogs in\r\nit, sets up a gallows on which he hangs the frogs in a row. In the\r\nneighbourhood of Plas the ceremony differs in some points. The king\r\nand his soldiers are completely clad in bark, adorned with flowers\r\nand ribbons; they all carry swords and ride horses, which are gay\r\nwith green branches and flowers. While the village dames and girls\r\nare being criticised at the arbour, a frog is secretly pinched and\r\npoked by the crier till it quacks. Sentence of death is passed on\r\nthe frog by the king; the hangman beheads it and flings the bleeding\r\nbody among the spectators. Lastly, the king is driven from the hut\r\nand pursued by the soldiers. The pinching and beheading of the frog\r\nare doubtless, as Mannhardt observes, a rain-charm. We have seen\r\nthat some Indians of the Orinoco beat frogs for the express purpose\r\nof producing rain, and that killing a frog is a European rain-charm.\r\n\r\nOften the spirit of vegetation in spring is represented by a queen\r\ninstead of a king. In the neighbourhood of Libchowic (Bohemia), on\r\nthe fourth Sunday in Lent, girls dressed in white and wearing the\r\nfirst spring flowers, as violets and daisies, in their hair, lead\r\nabout the village a girl who is called the Queen and is crowned with\r\nflowers. During the procession, which is conducted with great\r\nsolemnity, none of the girls may stand still, but must keep whirling\r\nround continually and singing. In every house the Queen announces\r\nthe arrival of spring and wishes the inmates good luck and\r\nblessings, for which she receives presents. In German Hungary the\r\ngirls choose the prettiest girl to be their Whitsuntide Queen,\r\nfasten a towering wreath on her brow, and carry her singing through\r\nthe streets. At every house they stop, sing old ballads, and receive\r\npresents. In the south-east of Ireland on May Day the prettiest girl\r\nused to be chosen Queen of the district for twelve months. She was\r\ncrowned with wild flowers; feasting, dancing, and rustic sports\r\nfollowed, and were closed by a grand procession in the evening.\r\nDuring her year of office she presided over rural gatherings of\r\nyoung people at dances and merry-makings. If she married before next\r\nMay Day, her authority was at an end, but her successor was not\r\nelected till that day came round. The May Queen is common In France\r\nand familiar in England.\r\n\r\nAgain the spirit of vegetation is sometimes represented by a king\r\nand queen, a lord and lady, or a bridegroom and bride. Here again\r\nthe parallelism holds between the anthropomorphic and the vegetable\r\nrepresentation of the tree-spirit, for we have seen above that trees\r\nare sometimes married to each other. At Halford in South\r\nWarwickshire the children go from house to house on May Day, walking\r\ntwo and two in procession and headed by a King and Queen. Two boys\r\ncarry a May-pole some six or seven feet high, which is covered with\r\nflowers and greenery. Fastened to it near the top are two cross-bars\r\nat right angles to each other. These are also decked with flowers,\r\nand from the ends of the bars hang hoops similarly adorned. At the\r\nhouses the children sing May songs and receive money, which is used\r\nto provide tea for them at the schoolhouse in the afternoon. In a\r\nBohemian village near K\xf6niggr\xe4tz on Whit-Monday the children play\r\nthe king\'s game, at which a king and queen march about under a\r\ncanopy, the queen wearing a garland, and the youngest girl carrying\r\ntwo wreaths on a plate behind them. They are attended by boys and\r\ngirls called groomsmen and bridesmaids, and they go from house to\r\nhouse collecting gifts. A regular feature in the popular celebration\r\nof Whitsuntide in Silesia used to be, and to some extent still is,\r\nthe contest for the kingship. This contest took various forms, but\r\nthe mark or goal was generally the May-tree or May-pole. Sometimes\r\nthe youth who succeeded in climbing the smooth pole and bringing\r\ndown the prize was proclaimed the Whitsuntide King and his\r\nsweetheart the Whitsuntide Bride. Afterwards the king, carrying the\r\nMay-bush, repaired with the rest of the company to the alehouse,\r\nwhere a dance and a feast ended the merry-making. Often the young\r\nfarmers and labourers raced on horseback to the May-pole, which was\r\nadorned with flowers, ribbons, and a crown. He who first reached the\r\npole was the Whitsuntide King, and the rest had to obey his orders\r\nfor that day. The worst rider became the clown. At the May-tree all\r\ndismounted and hoisted the king on their shoulders. He nimbly\r\nswarmed up the pole and brought down the May-bush and the crown,\r\nwhich had been fastened to the top. Meanwhile the clown hurried to\r\nthe alehouse and proceeded to bolt thirty rolls of bread and to swig\r\nfour quart bottles of brandy with the utmost possible despatch. He\r\nwas followed by the king, who bore the May-bush and crown at the\r\nhead of the company. If on their arrival the clown had already\r\ndisposed of the rolls and the brandy, and greeted the king with a\r\nspeech and a glass of beer, his score was paid by the king;\r\notherwise he had to settle it himself. After church time the stately\r\nprocession wound through the village. At the head of it rode the\r\nking, decked with flowers and carrying the May-bush. Next came the\r\nclown with his clothes turned inside out, a great flaxen beard on\r\nhis chain, and the Whitsuntide crown on his head. Two riders\r\ndisguised as guards followed. The procession drew up before every\r\nfarmyard; the two guards dismounted, shut the clown into the house,\r\nand claimed a contribution from the housewife to buy soap with which\r\nto wash the clown\'s beard. Custom allowed them to carry off any\r\nvictuals which were not under lock and key. Last of all they came to\r\nthe house in which the king\'s sweetheart lived. She was greeted as\r\nWhitsuntide Queen and received suitable presents--to wit, a\r\nmany-coloured sash, a cloth, and an apron. The king got as a prize,\r\na vest, a neck-cloth, and so forth, and had the right of setting up\r\nthe May-bush or Whitsuntide-tree before his master\'s yard, where it\r\nremained as an honourable token till the same day next year. Finally\r\nthe procession took its way to the tavern, where the king and queen\r\nopened the dance. Sometimes the Whitsuntide King and Queen succeeded\r\nto office in a different way. A man of straw, as large as life and\r\ncrowned with a red cap, was conveyed in a cart, between two men\r\narmed and disguised as guards, to a place where a mock court was\r\nwaiting to try him. A great crowd followed the cart. After a formal\r\ntrial the straw man was condemned to death and fastened to a stake\r\non the execution ground. The young men with bandaged eyes tried to\r\nstab him with a spear. He who succeeded became king and his\r\nsweetheart queen. The straw man was known as the Goliath.\r\n\r\nIn a parish of Denmark it used to be the custom at Whitsuntide to\r\ndress up a little girl as the Whitsun-bride and a little boy as her\r\ngroom. She was decked in all the finery of a grown-up bride, and\r\nwore a crown of the freshest flowers of spring on her head. Her\r\ngroom was as gay as flowers, ribbons, and knots could make him. The\r\nother children adorned themselves as best they could with the yellow\r\nflowers of the trollius and caltha. Then they went in great state\r\nfrom farmhouse to farmhouse, two little girls walking at the head of\r\nthe procession as bridesmaids, and six or eight outriders galloping\r\nahead on hobby-horses to announce their coming. Contributions of\r\neggs, butter, loaves, cream, coffee, sugar, and tallow-candles were\r\nreceived and conveyed away in baskets. When they had made the round\r\nof the farms, some of the farmers\' wives helped to arrange the\r\nwedding feast, and the children danced merrily in clogs on the\r\nstamped clay floor till the sun rose and the birds began to sing.\r\nAll this is now a thing of the past. Only the old folks still\r\nremember the little Whitsun-bride and her mimic pomp.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in Sweden the ceremonies associated elsewhere with\r\nMay Day or Whitsuntide commonly take place at Midsummer. Accordingly\r\nwe find that in some parts of the Swedish province of Blekinge they\r\nstill choose a Midsummer\'s Bride, to whom the "church coronet" is\r\noccasionally lent. The girl selects for herself a Bridegroom, and a\r\ncollection is made for the pair, who for the time being are looked\r\non as man and wife. The other youths also choose each his bride. A\r\nsimilar ceremony seems to be still kept up in Norway.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Brian\xe7on (Dauphin\xe9) on May Day the lads wrap\r\nup in green leaves a young fellow whose sweetheart has deserted him\r\nor married another. He lies down on the ground and feigns to be\r\nasleep. Then a girl who likes him, and would marry him, comes and\r\nwakes him, and raising him up offers him her arm and a flag. So they\r\ngo to the alehouse, where the pair lead off the dancing. But they\r\nmust marry within the year, or they are treated as old bachelor and\r\nold maid, and are debarred the company of the young folks. The lad\r\nis called the Bridegroom of the month of May. In the alehouse he\r\nputs off his garment of leaves, out of which, mixed with flowers,\r\nhis partner in the dance makes a nosegay, and wears it at her breast\r\nnext day, when he leads her again to the alehouse. Like this is a\r\nRussian custom observed in the district of Nerechta on the Thursday\r\nbefore Whitsunday. The girls go out into a birch-wood, wind a girdle\r\nor band round a stately birch, twist its lower branches into a\r\nwreath, and kiss each other in pairs through the wreath. The girls\r\nwho kiss through the wreath call each other gossips. Then one of the\r\ngirls steps forward, and mimicking a drunken man, flings herself on\r\nthe ground, rolls on the grass, and feigns to fall fast asleep.\r\nAnother girl wakens the pretended sleeper and kisses him; then the\r\nwhole bevy trips singing through the wood to twine garlands, which\r\nthey throw into the water. In the fate of the garlands floating on\r\nthe stream they read their own. Here the part of the sleeper was\r\nprobably at one time played by a lad. In these French and Russian\r\ncustoms we have a forsaken bridegroom, in the following a forsaken\r\nbride. On Shrove Tuesday the Slovenes of Oberkrain drag a straw\r\npuppet with joyous cries up and down the village; then they throw it\r\ninto the water or burn it, and from the height of the flames they\r\njudge of the abundance of the next harvest. The noisy crew is\r\nfollowed by a female masker, who drags a great board by a string and\r\ngives out that she is a forsaken bride.\r\n\r\nViewed in the light of what has gone before, the awakening of the\r\nforsaken sleeper in these ceremonies probably represents the revival\r\nof vegetation in spring. But it is not easy to assign their\r\nrespective parts to the forsaken bridegroom and to the girl who\r\nwakes him from his slumber. Is the sleeper the leafless forest or\r\nthe bare earth of winter? Is the girl who awakens him the fresh\r\nverdure or the genial sunshine of spring? It is hardly possible, on\r\nthe evidence before us, to answer these questions.\r\n\r\nIn the Highlands of Scotland the revival of vegetation in spring\r\nused to be graphically represented on St. Bride\'s Day, the first of\r\nFebruary. Thus in the Hebrides "the mistress and servants of each\r\nfamily take a sheaf of oats, and dress it up in women\'s apparel, put\r\nit in a large basket and lay a wooden club by it, and this they call\r\nBriid\'s bed; and then the mistress and servants cry three times,\r\n\'Briid is come, Briid is welcome.\' This they do just before going to\r\nbed, and when they rise in the morning they look among the ashes,\r\nexpecting to see the impression of Briid\'s club there; which if they\r\ndo, they reckon it a true presage of a good crop and prosperous\r\nyear, and the contrary they take as an ill omen." The same custom is\r\ndescribed by another witness thus: "Upon the night before Candlemas\r\nit is usual to make a bed with corn and hay, over which some\r\nblankets are laid, in a part of the house, near the door. When it is\r\nready, a person goes out and repeats three times, . . . \'Bridget,\r\nBridget, come in; thy bed is ready.\' One or more candles are left\r\nburning near it all night." Similarly in the Isle of Man "on the eve\r\nof the first of February, a festival was formerly kept, called, in\r\nthe Manks language, _Laa\'l Breeshey,_ in honour of the Irish lady\r\nwho went over to the Isle of Man to receive the veil from St.\r\nMaughold. The custom was to gather a bundle of green rushes, and\r\nstanding with them in the hand on the threshold of the door, to\r\ninvite the holy Saint Bridget to come and lodge with them that\r\nnight. In the Manks language, the invitation ran thus: _\'Brede,\r\nBrede, tar gys my thie tar dyn thie ayms noght Foshil jee yn dorrys\r\nda Brede, as lhig da Brede e heet staigh.\'_ In English: \'Bridget,\r\nBridget, come to my house, come to my house to-night. Open the door\r\nfor Bridget, and let Bridget come in.\' After these words were\r\nrepeated, the rushes were strewn on the floor by way of a carpet or\r\nbed for St. Bridget. A custom very similar to this was also observed\r\nin some of the Out-Isles of the ancient Kingdom of Man." In these\r\nManx and Highland ceremonies it is obvious that St. Bride, or St.\r\nBridget, is an old heathen goddess of fertility, disguised in a\r\nthreadbare Christian cloak. Probably she is no other than Brigit,\r\nthe Celtic goddess of fire and apparently of the crops.\r\n\r\nOften the marriage of the spirit of vegetation in spring, though not\r\ndirectly represented, is implied by naming the human representative\r\nof the spirit, "the Bride," and dressing her in wedding attire. Thus\r\nin some villages of Altmark at Whitsuntide, while the boys go about\r\ncarrying a May-tree or leading a boy enveloped in leaves and\r\nflowers, the girls lead about the May Bride, a girl dressed as a\r\nbride with a great nosegay in her hair. They go from house to house,\r\nthe May Bride singing a song in which she asks for a present and\r\ntells the inmates of each house that if they give her something they\r\nwill themselves have something the whole year through; but if they\r\ngive her nothing they will themselves have nothing. In some parts of\r\nWestphalia two girls lead a flower-crowned girl called the\r\nWhitsuntide Bride from door to door, singing a song in which they\r\nask for eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. The Influence of the Sexes on Vegetation\r\n\r\nFROM THE PRECEDING examination of the spring and summer festivals of\r\nEurope we may infer that our rude forefathers personified the powers\r\nof vegetation as male and female, and attempted, on the principle of\r\nhomoeopathic or imitative magic, to quicken the growth of trees and\r\nplants by representing the marriage of the sylvan deities in the\r\npersons of a King and Queen of May, a Whitsun Bridegroom and Bride,\r\nand so forth. Such representations were accordingly no mere symbolic\r\nor allegorical dramas, pastoral plays designed to amuse or instruct\r\na rustic audience. They were charms intended to make the woods to\r\ngrow green, the fresh grass to sprout, the corn to shoot, and the\r\nflowers to blow. And it was natural to suppose that the more closely\r\nthe mock marriage of the leaf-clad or flower-decked mummers aped the\r\nreal marriage of the woodland sprites, the more effective would be\r\nthe charm. Accordingly we may assume with a high degree of\r\nprobability that the profligacy which notoriously attended these\r\nceremonies was at one time not an accidental excess but an essential\r\npart of the rites, and that in the opinion of those who performed\r\nthem the marriage of trees and plants could not be fertile without\r\nthe real union of the human sexes. At the present day it might\r\nperhaps be vain to look in civilised Europe for customs of this sort\r\nobserved for the explicit purpose of promoting the growth of\r\nvegetation. But ruder races in other parts of the world have\r\nconsciously employed the intercourse of the sexes as a means to\r\nensure the fruitfulness of the earth; and some rites which are\r\nstill, or were till lately, kept up in Europe can be reasonably\r\nexplained only as stunted relics of a similar practice. The\r\nfollowing facts will make this plain.\r\n\r\nFor four days before they committed the seed to the earth the\r\nPipiles of Central America kept apart from their wives "in order\r\nthat on the night before planting they might indulge their passions\r\nto the fullest extent; certain persons are even said to have been\r\nappointed to perform the sexual act at the very moment when the\r\nfirst seeds were deposited in the ground." The use of their wives at\r\nthat time was indeed enjoined upon the people by the priests as a\r\nreligious duty, in default of which it was not lawful to sow the\r\nseed. The only possible explanation of this custom seems to be that\r\nthe Indians confused the process by which human beings reproduce\r\ntheir kind with the process by which plants discharge the same\r\nfunction, and fancied that by resorting to the former they were\r\nsimultaneously forwarding the latter. In some parts of Java, at the\r\nseason when the bloom will soon be on the rice, the husbandman and\r\nhis wife visit their fields by night and there engage in sexual\r\nintercourse for the purpose of promoting the growth of the crop. In\r\nthe Leti, Sarmata, and some other groups of islands which lie\r\nbetween the western end of New Guinea and the northern part of\r\nAustralia, the heathen population regard the sun as the male\r\nprinciple by whom the earth or female pr\xednciple is fertilised. They\r\ncall him Upu-lera or Mr. Sun, and represent him under the form of a\r\nlamp made of coco-nut leaves, which may be seen hanging everywhere\r\nin their houses and in the sacred fig-tree. Under the tree lies a\r\nlarge flat stone, which serves as a sacrificial table. On it the\r\nheads of slain foes were and are still placed in some of the\r\nislands. Once a year, at the beginning of the rainy season, Mr. Sun\r\ncomes down into the holy fig-tree to fertilise the earth, and to\r\nfacilitate his descent a ladder with seven rungs is considerately\r\nplaced at his disposal. It is set up under the tree and is adorned\r\nwith carved figures of the birds whose shrill clarion heralds the\r\napproach of the sun in the east. On this occasion pigs and dogs are\r\nsacrificed in profusion; men and women alike indulge in a\r\nsaturnalia; and the mystic union of the sun and the earth is\r\ndramatically represented in public, amid song and dance, by the real\r\nunion of the sexes under the tree. The object of the festival, we\r\nare told, is to procure rain, plenty of food and drink, abundance of\r\ncattle and children and riches from Grandfather Sun. They pray that\r\nhe may make every she-goat to cast two or three young, the people to\r\nmultiply, the dead pigs to be replaced by living pigs, the empty\r\nrice-baskets to be filled, and so on. And to induce him to grant\r\ntheir requests they offer him pork and rice and liquor, and invite\r\nhim to fall to. In the Babar Islands a special flag is hoisted at\r\nthis festival as a symbol of the creative energy of the sun; it is\r\nof white cotton, about nine feet high, and consists of the figure of\r\na man in an appropriate attitude. It would be unjust to treat these\r\norgies as a mere outburst of unbridled passion; no doubt they are\r\ndeliberately and solemnly organised as essential to the fertility of\r\nthe earth and the welfare of man.\r\n\r\nThe same means which are thus adopted to stimulate the growth of the\r\ncrops are naturally employed to ensure the fruitfulness of trees. In\r\nsome parts of Amboyna, when the state of the clove plantation\r\nindicates that the crop is likely to be scanty, the men go naked to\r\nthe plantations by night, and there seek to fertilise the trees\r\nprecisely as they would impregnate women, while at the same time\r\nthey call out for "More cloves!" This is supposed to make the trees\r\nbear fruit more abundantly.\r\n\r\nThe Baganda of Central Africa believe so strongly in the intimate\r\nrelation between the intercourse of the sexes and the fertility of\r\nthe ground that among them a barren wife is generally sent away,\r\nbecause she is supposed to prevent her husband\'s garden from bearing\r\nfruit. On the contrary, a couple who have given proof of\r\nextraordinary fertility by becoming the parents of twins are\r\nbelieved by the Baganda to be endowed with a corresponding power of\r\nincreasing the fruitfulness of the plantain-trees, which furnish\r\nthem with their staple food. Some little time after the birth of the\r\ntwins a ceremony is performed, the object of which clearly is to\r\ntransmit the reproductive virtue of the parents to the plantains.\r\nThe mother lies down on her back in the thick grass near the house\r\nand places a flower of the plantain between her legs; then her\r\nhusband comes and knocks the flower away with his genital member.\r\nFurther, the parents go through the country performing dances in the\r\ngardens of favoured friends, apparently for the purpose of causing\r\nthe plantain-trees to bear fruit more abundantly.\r\n\r\nIn various parts of Europe customs have prevailed both at spring and\r\nharvest which are clearly based on the same crude notion that the\r\nrelation of the human sexes to each other can be so used as to\r\nquicken the growth of plants. For example, in the Ukraine on St.\r\nGeorge\'s Day (the twenty-third of April) the priest in his robes,\r\nattended by his acolytes, goes out to the fields of the village,\r\nwhere the crops are beginning to show green above the ground, and\r\nblesses them. After that the young married people lie down in\r\ncouples on the sown fields and roll several times over on them, in\r\nthe belief that this will promote the growth of the crops. In some\r\nparts of Russia the priest himself is rolled by women over the\r\nsprouting crop, and that without regard to the mud and holes which\r\nhe may encounter in his beneficent progress. If the shepherd resists\r\nor remonstrates, his flock murmurs, "Little Father, you do not\r\nreally wish us well, you do not wish us to have corn, although you\r\ndo wish to live on our corn." In some parts of Germany at harvest\r\nthe men and women, who have reaped the corn, roll together on the\r\nfield. This again is probably a mitigation of an older and ruder\r\ncustom designed to impart fertility to the fields by methods like\r\nthose resorted to by the Pipiles of Central America long ago and by\r\nthe cultivators of rice in Java at the present time.\r\n\r\nTo the student who cares to track the devious course of the human\r\nmind in its gropings after truth, it is of some interest to observe\r\nthat the same theoretical belief in the sympathetic influence of the\r\nsexes on vegetation, which has led some peoples to indulge their\r\npassions as a means of fertilising the earth, has led others to seek\r\nthe same end by directly opposite means. From the moment that they\r\nsowed the maize till the time that they reaped it, the Indians of\r\nNicaragua lived chastely, keeping apart from their wives and\r\nsleeping in a separate place. They ate no salt, and drank neither\r\ncocoa nor _chicha,_ the fermented liquor made from maize; in short\r\nthe season was for them, as the Spanish historian observes, a time\r\nof abstinence. To this day some of the Indian tribes of Central\r\nAmerica practise continence for the purpose of thereby promoting the\r\ngrowth of the crops. Thus we are told that before sowing the maize\r\nthe Kekchi Indians sleep apart from their wives, and eat no flesh\r\nfor five days, while among the Lanquineros and Cajaboneros the\r\nperiod of abstinence from these carnal pleasures extends to thirteen\r\ndays. So amongst some of the Germans of Transylvania it is a rule\r\nthat no man may sleep with his wife during the whole of the time\r\nthat he is engaged in sowing his fields. The same rule is observed\r\nat Kalotaszeg in Hungary; the people think that if the custom were\r\nnot observed the corn would be mildewed. Similarly a Central\r\nAustralian headman of the Kaitish tribe strictly abstains from\r\nmarital relations with his wife all the time that he is performing\r\nmagical ceremonies to make the grass grow; for he believes that a\r\nbreach of this rule would prevent the grass seed from sprouting\r\nproperly. In some of the Melanesian islands, when the yam vines are\r\nbeing trained, the men sleep near the gardens and never approach\r\ntheir wives; should they enter the garden after breaking this rule\r\nof continence the fruits of the garden would be spoilt.\r\n\r\nIf we ask why it is that similar beliefs should logically lead,\r\namong different peoples, to such opposite modes of conduct as strict\r\nchastity and more or less open debauchery, the reason, as it\r\npresents itself to the primitive mind, is perhaps not very far to\r\nseek. If rude man identifies himself, in a manner, with nature; if\r\nhe fails to distinguish the impulses and processes in himself from\r\nthe methods which nature adopts to ensure the reproduction of plants\r\nand animals, he may leap to one of two conclusions. Either he may\r\ninfer that by yielding to his appetites he will thereby assist in\r\nthe multiplication of plants and animals; or he may imagine that the\r\nvigour which he refuses to expend in reproducing his own kind, will\r\nform as it were a store of energy whereby other creatures, whether\r\nvegetable or animal, will somehow benefit in propagating their\r\nspecies. Thus from the same crude philosophy, the same primitive\r\nnotions of nature and life, the savage may derive by different\r\nchannels a rule either of profligacy or of asceticism.\r\n\r\nTo readers bred in religion which is saturated with the ascetic\r\nidealism of the East, the explanation which I have given of the rule\r\nof continence observed under certain circumstances by rude or savage\r\npeoples may seem far-fetched and improbable. They may think that\r\nmoral purity, which is so intimately associated in their minds with\r\nthe observance of such a rule, furnishes a sufficient explanation of\r\nit; they may hold with Milton that chastity in itself is a noble\r\nvirtue, and that the restraint which it imposes on one of the\r\nstrongest impulses of our animal nature marks out those who can\r\nsubmit to it as men raised above the common herd, and therefore\r\nworthy to receive the seal of the divine approbation. However\r\nnatural this mode of thought may seem to us, it is utterly foreign\r\nand indeed incomprehensible to the savage. If he resists on occasion\r\nthe sexual instinct, it is from no high idealism, no ethereal\r\naspiration after moral purity, but for the sake of some ulterior yet\r\nperfectly definite and concrete object, to gain which he is prepared\r\nto sacrifice the immediate gratification of his senses. That this is\r\nor may be so, the examples I have cited are amply sufficient to\r\nprove. They show that where the instinct of self-preservation, which\r\nmanifests itself chiefly in the search for food, conflicts or\r\nappears to conflict with the instinct which conduces to the\r\npropagation of the species, the former instinct, as the primary and\r\nmore fundamental, is capable of overmastering the latter. In short,\r\nthe savage is willing to restrain his sexual propensity for the sake\r\nof food. Another object for the sake of which he consents to\r\nexercise the same self-restraint is victory in war. Not only the\r\nwarrior in the field but his friends at home will often bridle their\r\nsensual appetites from a belief that by so doing they will the more\r\neasily overcome their enemies. The fallacy of such a belief, like\r\nthe belief that the chastity of the sower conduces to the growth of\r\nthe seed, is plain enough to us; yet perhaps the self-restraint\r\nwhich these and the like beliefs, vain and false as they are, have\r\nimposed on mankind, has not been without its utility in bracing and\r\nstrengthening the breed. For strength of character in the race as in\r\nthe individual consists mainly in the power of sacrificing the\r\npresent to the future, of disregarding the immediate temptations of\r\nephemeral pleasure for more distant and lasting sources of\r\nsatisfaction. The more the power is exercised the higher and\r\nstronger becomes the character; till the height of heroism is\r\nreached in men who renounce the pleasures of life and even life\r\nitself for the sake of keeping or winning for others, perhaps in\r\ndistant ages, the blessings of freedom and truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. The Sacred Marriage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Diana as a Goddess of Fertility\r\n\r\nWE have seen that according to a widespread belief, which is not\r\nwithout a foundation in fact, plants reproduce their kinds through\r\nthe sexual union of male and female elements, and that on the\r\nprinciple of homoeopathic or imitative magic this reproduction is\r\nsupposed to be stimulated by the real or mock marriage of men and\r\nwomen, who masquerade for the time being as spirits of vegetation.\r\nSuch magical dramas have played a great part in the popular\r\nfestivals of Europe, and based as they are on a very crude\r\nconception of natural law, it is clear that they must have been\r\nhanded down from a remote antiquity. We shall hardly, therefore, err\r\nin assuming that they date from a time when the forefathers of the\r\ncivilised nations of Europe were still barbarians, herding their\r\ncattle and cultivating patches of corn in the clearings of the vast\r\nforests, which then covered the greater part of the continent, from\r\nthe Mediterranean to the Arctic Ocean. But if these old spells and\r\nenchantments for the growth of leaves and blossoms, of grass and\r\nflowers and fruit, have lingered down to our own time in the shape\r\nof pastoral plays and popular merry-makings, is it not reasonable to\r\nsuppose that they survived in less attenuated forms some two\r\nthousand years ago among the civilised peoples of antiquity? Or, to\r\nput it otherwise, is it not likely that in certain festivals of the\r\nancients we may be able to detect the equivalents of our May Day,\r\nWhitsuntide, and Midsummer celebrations, with this difference, that\r\nin those days the ceremonies had not yet dwindled into mere shows\r\nand pageants, but were still religious or magical rites, in which\r\nthe actors consciously supported the high parts of gods and\r\ngoddesses? Now in the first chapter of this book we found reason to\r\nbelieve that the priest who bore the title of King of the Wood at\r\nNemi had for his mate the goddess of the grove, Diana herself. May\r\nnot he and she, as King and Queen of the Wood, have been serious\r\ncounterparts of the merry mummers who play the King and Queen of\r\nMay, the Whitsuntide Bridegroom and Bride in modern Europe? and may\r\nnot their union have been yearly celebrated in a _theogamy_ or\r\ndivine marriage? Such dramatic weddings of gods and goddesses, as we\r\nshall see presently, were carried out as solemn religious rites in\r\nmany parts of the ancient world; hence there is no intrinsic\r\nimprobability in the supposition that the sacred grove at Nemi may\r\nhave been the scene of an annual ceremony of this sort. Direct\r\nevidence that it was so there is none, but analogy pleads in favour\r\nof the view, as I shall now endeavour to show.\r\n\r\nDiana was essentially a goddess of the woodlands, as Ceres was a\r\ngoddess of the corn and Bacchus a god of the vine. Her sanctuaries\r\nwere commonly in groves, indeed every grove was sacred to her, and\r\nshe is often associated with the forest god Silvanus in dedications.\r\nBut whatever her origin may have been, Diana was not always a mere\r\ngoddess of trees. Like her Greek sister Artemis, she appears to have\r\ndeveloped into a personification of the teeming life of nature, both\r\nanimal and vegetable. As mistress of the greenwood she would\r\nnaturally be thought to own the beasts, whether wild or tame, that\r\nranged through it, lurking for their prey in its gloomy depths,\r\nmunching the fresh leaves and shoots among the boughs, or cropping\r\nthe herbage in the open glades and dells. Thus she might come to be\r\nthe patron goddess both of hunters and herdsmen, just as Silvanus\r\nwas the god not only of woods, but of cattle. Similarly in Finland\r\nthe wild beasts of the forest were regarded as the herds of the\r\nwoodland god Tapio and of his stately and beautiful wife. No man\r\nmight slay one of these animals without the gracious permission of\r\ntheir divine owners. Hence the hunter prayed to the sylvan deities,\r\nand vowed rich offerings to them if they would drive the game across\r\nhis path. And cattle also seem to have enjoyed the protection of\r\nthose spirits of the woods, both when they were in their stalls and\r\nwhile they strayed in the forest. Before the Gayos of Sumatra hunt\r\ndeer, wild goats, or wild pigs with hounds in the woods, they deem\r\nit necessary to obtain the leave of the unseen Lord of the forest.\r\nThis is done according to a prescribed form by a man who has special\r\nskill in woodcraft. He lays down a quid of betel before a stake\r\nwhich is cut in a particular way to represent the Lord of the Wood,\r\nand having done so he prays to the spirit to signify his consent or\r\nrefusal. In his treatise on hunting, Arrian tells us that the Celts\r\nused to offer an annual sacrifice to Artemis on her birthday,\r\npurchasing the sacrificial victim with the fines which they had paid\r\ninto her treasury for every fox, hare, and roe that they had killed\r\nin the course of the year. The custom clearly implied that the wild\r\nbeasts belonged to the goddess, and that she must be compensated for\r\ntheir slaughter.\r\n\r\nBut Diana was not merely a patroness of wild beasts, a mistress of\r\nwoods and hills, of lonely glades and sounding rivers; conceived as\r\nthe moon, and especially, it would seem, as the yellow harvest moon,\r\nshe filled the farmer\'s grange with goodly fruits, and heard the\r\nprayers of women in travail. In her sacred grove at Nemi, as we have\r\nseen, she was especially worshipped as a goddess of childbirth, who\r\nbestowed offspring on men and women. Thus Diana, like the Greek\r\nArtemis, with whom she was constantly identified, may be described\r\nas a goddess of nature in general and of fertility in particular. We\r\nneed not wonder, therefore, that in her sanctuary on the Aventine\r\nshe was represented by an image copied from the many-breasted idol\r\nof the Ephesian Artemis, with all its crowded emblems of exuberant\r\nfecundity. Hence too we can understand why an ancient Roman law,\r\nattributed to King Tullus Hostilius, prescribed that, when incest\r\nhad been committed, an expiatory sacrifice should be offered by the\r\npontiffs in the grove of Diana. For we know that the crime of incest\r\nis commonly supposed to cause a dearth; hence it would be meet that\r\natonement for the offence should be made to the goddess of\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\nNow on the principle that the goddess of fertility must herself be\r\nfertile, it behoved Diana to have a male partner. Her mate, if the\r\ntestimony of Servius may be trusted, was that Virbius who had his\r\nrepresentative, or perhaps rather his embodiment, in the King of the\r\nWood at Nemi. The aim of their union would be to promote the\r\nfruitfulness of the earth, of animals, and of mankind; and it might\r\nnaturally be thought that this object would be more surely attained\r\nif the sacred nuptials were celebrated every year, the parts of the\r\ndivine bride and bridegroom being played either by their images or\r\nby living persons. No ancient writer mentions that this was done in\r\nthe grove at Nemi; but our knowledge of the Arician ritual is so\r\nscanty that the want of information on this head can hardly count as\r\na fatal objection to the theory. That theory, in the absence of\r\ndirect evidence, must necessarily be based on the analogy of similar\r\ncustoms practised elsewhere. Some modern examples of such customs,\r\nmore or less degenerate, were described in the last chapter. Here we\r\nshall consider their ancient counterparts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Marriage of the Gods\r\n\r\nAT BABYLON the imposing sanctuary of Bel rose like a pyramid above\r\nthe city in a series of eight towers or stories, planted one on the\r\ntop of the other. On the highest tower, reached by an ascent which\r\nwound about all the rest, there stood a spacious temple, and in the\r\ntemple a great bed, magnificently draped and cushioned, with a\r\ngolden table beside it. In the temple no image was to be seen, and\r\nno human being passed the night there, save a single woman, whom,\r\naccording to the Chaldean priests, the god chose from among all the\r\nwomen of Babylon. They said that the deity himself came into the\r\ntemple at night and slept in the great bed; and the woman, as a\r\nconsort of the god, might have no intercourse with mortal man.\r\n\r\nAt Thebes in Egypt a woman slept in the temple of Ammon as the\r\nconsort of the god, and, like the human wife of Bel at Babylon, she\r\nwas said to have no commerce with a man. In Egyptian texts she is\r\noften mentioned as "the divine consort," and usually she was no less\r\na personage than the Queen of Egypt herself. For, according to the\r\nEgyptians, their monarchs were actually begotten by the god Ammon,\r\nwho assumed for the time being the form of the reigning king, and in\r\nthat disguise had intercourse with the queen. The divine procreation\r\nis carved and painted in great detail on the walls of two of the\r\noldest temples in Egypt, those of Deir el Bahari and Luxor; and the\r\ninscriptions attached to the paintings leave no doubt as to the\r\nmeaning of the scenes.\r\n\r\nAt Athens the god of the vine, Dionysus, was annually married to the\r\nQueen, and it appears that the consummation of the divine union, as\r\nwell as the espousals, was enacted at the ceremony; but whether the\r\npart of the god was played by a man or an image we do not know. We\r\nlearn from Aristotle that the ceremony took place in the old\r\nofficial residence of the King, known as the Cattle-stall, which\r\nstood near the Prytaneum or Town-hall on the north-eastern slope of\r\nthe Acropolis. The object of the marriage can hardly have been any\r\nother than that of ensuring the fertility of the vines and other\r\nfruit-trees of which Dionysus was the god. Thus both in form and in\r\nmeaning the ceremony would answer to the nuptials of the King and\r\nQueen of May.\r\n\r\nIn the great mysteries solemnised at Eleusis in the month of\r\nSeptember the union of the sky-god Zeus with the corn-goddess\r\nDemeter appears to have been represented by the union of the\r\nhierophant with the priestess of Demeter, who acted the parts of god\r\nand goddess. But their intercourse was only dramatic or symbolical,\r\nfor the hierophant had temporarily deprived himself of his virility\r\nby an application of hemlock. The torches having been extinguished,\r\nthe pair descended into a murky place, while the throng of\r\nworshippers awaited in anxious suspense the result of the mystic\r\ncongress, on which they believed their own salvation to depend.\r\nAfter a time the hierophant reappeared, and in a blaze of light\r\nsilently exhibited to the assembly a reaped ear of corn, the fruit\r\nof the divine marriage. Then in a loud voice he proclaimed, "Queen\r\nBrimo has brought forth a sacred boy Brimos," by which he meant,\r\n"The Mighty One has brought forth the Mighty." The corn-mother in\r\nfact had given birth to her child, the corn, and her travail-pangs\r\nwere enacted in the sacred drama. This revelation of the reaped corn\r\nappears to have been the crowning act of the mysteries. Thus through\r\nthe glamour shed round these rites by the poetry and philosophy of\r\nlater ages there still looms, like a distant landscape through a\r\nsunlit haze, a simple rustic festival designed to cover the wide\r\nEleusinian plain with a plenteous harvest by wedding the goddess of\r\nthe corn to the sky-god, who fertilised the bare earth with genial\r\nshowers. Every few years the people of Plataea, in Boeotia, held a\r\nfestival called the Little Daedala, at which they felled an oak-tree\r\nin an ancient oak forest. Out of the tree they carved an image, and\r\nhaving dressed it as a bride, they set it on a bullock-cart with a\r\nbridesmaid beside it. The image seems then to have been drawn to the\r\nbank of the river Asopus and back to the town, attended by a piping\r\nand dancing crowd. Every sixty years the festival of the Great\r\nDaedala was celebrated by all the people of Boeotia; and at it all\r\nthe images, fourteen in number, which had accumulated at the lesser\r\nfestivals, were dragged on wains in procession to the river Asopus\r\nand then to the top of Mount Cithaeron, where they were burnt on a\r\ngreat pyre. The story told to explain the festivals suggests that\r\nthey celebrated the marriage of Zeus to Hera, represented by the\r\noaken image in bridal array. In Sweden every year a life-size image\r\nof Frey, the god of fertility, both animal and vegetable, was drawn\r\nabout the country in a waggon attended by a beautiful girl who was\r\ncalled the god\'s wife. She acted also as his priestess in his great\r\ntemple at Upsala. Wherever the waggon came with the image of the god\r\nand his blooming young bride, the people crowded to meet them and\r\noffered sacrifices for a fruitful year.\r\n\r\nThus the custom of marrying gods either to images or to human beings\r\nwas widespread among the nations of antiquity. The ideas on which\r\nsuch a custom is based are too crude to allow us to doubt that the\r\ncivilised Babylonians, Egyptians, and Greeks inherited it from their\r\nbarbarous or savage forefathers. This presumption is strengthened\r\nwhen we find rites of a similar kind in vogue among the lower races.\r\nThus, for example, we are told that once upon a time the Wotyaks of\r\nthe Malmyz district in Russia were distressed by a series of bad\r\nharvests. They did not know what to do, but at last concluded that\r\ntheir powerful but mischievious god Keremet must be angry at being\r\nunmarried. So a deputation of elders visited the Wotyaks of Cura and\r\ncame to an understanding with them on the subject. Then they\r\nreturned home, laid in a large stock of brandy, and having made\r\nready a gaily decked waggon and horses, they drove in procession\r\nwith bells ringing, as they do when they are fetching home a bride,\r\nto the sacred grove at Cura. There they ate and drank merrily all\r\nnight, and next morning they cut a square piece of turf in the grove\r\nand took it home with them. After that, though it fared well with\r\nthe people of Malmyz, it fared ill with the people of Cura; for in\r\nMalmyz the bread was good, but in Cura it was bad. Hence the men of\r\nCura who had consented to the marriage were blamed and roughly\r\nhandled by their indignant fellow-villagers. "What they meant by\r\nthis marriage ceremony," says the writer who reports it, "it is not\r\neasy to imagine. Perhaps, as Bechterew thinks, they meant to marry\r\nKeremet to the kindly and fruitful Mukylcin, the Earth-wife, in\r\norder that she might influence him for good." When wells are dug in\r\nBengal, a wooden image of a god is made and married to the goddess\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nOften the bride destined for the god is not a log or a cloud, but a\r\nliving woman of flesh and blood. The Indians of a village in Peru\r\nhave been known to marry a beautiful girl, about fourteen years of\r\nage, to a stone shaped like a human being, which they regarded as a\r\ngod (_huaca_). All the villagers took part in the marriage ceremony,\r\nwhich lasted three days, and was attended with much revelry. The\r\ngirl thereafter remained a virgin and sacrificed to the idol for the\r\npeople. They showed her the utmost reverence and deemed her divine.\r\nEvery year about the middle of March, when the season for fishing\r\nwith the dragnet began, the Algonquins and Hurons married their nets\r\nto two young girls, aged six or seven. At the wedding feast the net\r\nwas placed between the two maidens, and was exhorted to take courage\r\nand catch many fish. The reason for choosing the brides so young was\r\nto make sure that they were virgins. The origin of the custom is\r\nsaid to have been this. One year, when the fishing season came\r\nround, the Algonquins cast their nets as usual, but took nothing.\r\nSurprised at their want of success, they did not know what to make\r\nof it, till the soul or genius (_oki_) of the net appeared to them\r\nin the likeness of a tall well-built man, who said to them in a\r\ngreat passion, "I have lost my wife and I cannot find one who has\r\nknown no other man but me; that is why you do not succeed, and why\r\nyou never will succeed till you give me satisfaction on this head."\r\nSo the Algonquins held a council and resolved to appease the spirit\r\nof the net by marrying him to two such very young girls that he\r\ncould have no ground of complaint on that score for the future. They\r\ndid so, and the fishing turned out all that could be wished. The\r\nthing got wind among their neighbours the Hurons, and they adopted\r\nthe custom. A share of the catch was always given to the families of\r\nthe two girls who acted as brides of the net for the year.\r\n\r\nThe Oraons of Bengal worship the Earth as a goddess, and annually\r\ncelebrate her marriage with the Sun-god Dharme\xaf at the time when the\r\n_sa\xafl_ tree is in blossom. The ceremony is as follows. All bathe,\r\nthen the men repair to the sacred grove (_sarna_), while the women\r\nassemble at the house of the village priest. After sacrificing some\r\nfowls to the Sun-god and the demon of the grove, the men eat and\r\ndrink. "The priest is then carried back to the village on the\r\nshoulders of a strong man. Near the village the women meet the men\r\nand wash their feet. With beating of drums and singing, dancing, and\r\njumping, all proceed to the priest\'s house, which has been decorated\r\nwith leaves and flowers. Then the usual form of marriage is\r\nperformed between the priest and his wife, symbolising the supposed\r\nunion between Sun and Earth. After the ceremony all eat and drink\r\nand make merry; they dance and sing obscene songs, and finally\r\nindulge in the vilest orgies. The object is to move the mother earth\r\nto become fruitful." Thus the Sacred Marriage of the Sun and Earth,\r\npersonated by the priest and his wife, is celebrated as a charm to\r\nensure the fertility of the ground; and for the same purpose, on the\r\nprinciple of homoeopathic magic, the people indulge in licentious\r\norgy.\r\n\r\nIt deserves to be remarked that the supernatural being to whom women\r\nare married is often a god or spirit of water. Thus Mukasa, the god\r\nof the Victoria Nyanza lake, who was propitiated by the Baganda\r\nevery time they undertook a long voyage, had virgins provided for\r\nhim to serve as his wives. Like the Vestals they were bound to\r\nchastity, but unlike the Vestals they seem to have been often\r\nunfaithful. The custom lasted until Mwanga was converted to\r\nChristianity. The Akikuyu of British East Africa worship the snake\r\nof a certain river, and at intervals of several years they marry the\r\nsnake-god to women, but especially to young girls. For this purpose\r\nhuts are built by order of the medicine-men, who there consummate\r\nthe sacred marriage with the credulous female devotees. If the girls\r\ndo not repair to the huts of their own accord in sufficient numbers,\r\nthey are seized and dragged thither to the embraces of the deity.\r\nThe offspring of these mystic unions appears to be fathered on God\r\n(_ngai_); certainly there are children among the Akikuyu who pass\r\nfor children of God. It is said that once, when the inhabitants of\r\nCayeli in Buru--an East Indian island--were threatened with\r\ndestruction by a swarm of crocodiles, they ascribed the misfortune\r\nto a passion which the prince of the crocodiles had conceived for a\r\ncertain girl. Accordingly, they compelled the damsel\'s father to\r\ndress her in bridal array and deliver her over to the clutches of\r\nher crocodile lover.\r\n\r\nA usage of the same sort is reported to have prevailed in the\r\nMaldive Islands before the conversion of the inhabitants to Islam.\r\nThe famous Arab traveller Ibn Batutah has described the custom and\r\nthe manner in which it came to an end. He was assured by several\r\ntrustworthy natives, whose names he gives, that when the people of\r\nthe islands were idolaters there appeared to them every month an\r\nevil spirit among the jinn, who came from across the sea in the\r\nlikeness of a ship full of burning lamps. The wont of the\r\ninhabitants, as soon as they perceived him, was to take a young\r\nvirgin, and, having adorned her, to lead her to a heathen temple\r\nthat stood on the shore, with a window looking out to sea. There\r\nthey left the damsel for the night, and when they came back in the\r\nmorning they found her a maid no more, and dead. Every month they\r\ndrew lots, and he upon whom the lot fell gave up his daughter to the\r\njinnee of the sea. The last of the maidens thus offered to the demon\r\nwas rescued by a pious Berber, who by reciting the Koran succeeded\r\nin driving the jinnee back into the sea.\r\n\r\nIbn Batutah\'s narrative of the demon lover and his mortal brides\r\nclosely resembles a well-known type of folk-tale, of which versions\r\nhave been found from Japan and Annam in the East to Senegambia,\r\nScandinavia, and Scotland in the West. The story varies in details\r\nfrom people to people, but as commonly told it runs thus. A certain\r\ncountry is infested by a many-headed serpent, dragon, or other\r\nmonster, which would destroy the whole people if a human victim,\r\ngenerally a virgin, were not delivered up to him periodically. Many\r\nvictims have perished, and at last it has fallen to the lot of the\r\nking\'s own daughter to be sacrificed. She is exposed to the monster,\r\nbut the hero of the tale, generally a young man of humble birth,\r\ninterposes in her behalf, slays the monster, and receives the hand\r\nof the princess as his reward. In many of the tales the monster, who\r\nis sometimes described as a serpent, inhabits the water of a sea, a\r\nlake, or a fountain. In other versions he is a serpent or dragon who\r\ntakes possession of the springs of water, and only allows the water\r\nto flow or the people to make use of it on condition of receiving a\r\nhuman victim.\r\n\r\nIt would probably be a mistake to dismiss all these tales as pure\r\ninventions of the story-teller. Rather we may suppose that they\r\nreflect a real custom of sacrificing girls or women to be the wives\r\nof waterspirits, who are very often conceived as great serpents or\r\ndragons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. The Kings of Rome and Alba\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Numa and Egeria\r\n\r\nFROM THE FOREGOING survey of custom and legend we may infer that the\r\nsacred marriage of the powers both of vegetation and of water has\r\nbeen celebrated by many peoples for the sake of promoting the\r\nfertility of the earth, on which the life of animals and men\r\nultimately depends, and that in such rites the part of the divine\r\nbridegroom or bride is often sustained by a man or woman. The\r\nevidence may, therefore, lend some countenance to the conjecture\r\nthat in the sacred grove at Nemi, where the powers of vegetation and\r\nof water manifested themselves in the fair forms of shady woods,\r\ntumbling cascades, and glassy lake, a marriage like that of our King\r\nand Queen of May was annually celebrated between the mortal King of\r\nthe Wood and the immortal Queen of the Wood, Diana. In this\r\nconnexion an important figure in the grove was the water-nymph\r\nEgeria, who was worshipped by pregnant women because she, like\r\nDiana, could grant them an easy delivery. From this it seems fairly\r\nsafe to conclude that, like many other springs, the water of Egeria\r\nwas credited with a power of facilitating conception as well as\r\ndelivery. The votive offerings found on the spot, which clearly\r\nrefer to the begetting of children, may possibly have been dedicated\r\nto Egeria rather than to Diana, or perhaps we should rather say that\r\nthe water-nymph Egeria is only another form of the great\r\nnature-goddess Diana herself, the mistress of sounding rivers as\r\nwell as of umbrageous woods, who had her home by the lake and her\r\nmirror in its calm waters, and whose Greek counterpart Artemis loved\r\nto haunt meres and springs. The identification of Egeria with Diana\r\nis confirmed by a statement of Plutarch that Egeria was one of the\r\noak-nymphs whom the Romans believed to preside over every green\r\noak-grove; for, while Diana was a goddess of the woodlands in\r\ngeneral, she appears to have been intimately associated with oaks in\r\nparticular, especially at her sacred grove of Nemi. Perhaps, then,\r\nEgeria was the fairy of a spring that flowed from the roots of a\r\nsacred oak. Such a spring is said to have gushed from the foot of\r\nthe great oak at Dodona, and from its murmurous flow the priestess\r\ndrew oracles. Among the Greeks a draught of water from certain\r\nsacred springs or wells was supposed to confer prophetic powers.\r\nThis would explain the more than mortal wisdom with which, according\r\nto tradition, Egeria inspired her royal husband or lover Numa. When\r\nwe remember how very often in early society the king is held\r\nresponsible for the fall of rain and the fruitfulness of the earth,\r\nit seems hardly rash to conjecture that in the legend of the\r\nnuptials of Numa and Egeria we have a reminiscence of a sacred\r\nmarriage which the old Roman kings regularly contracted with a\r\ngoddess of vegetation and water for the purpose of enabling him to\r\ndischarge his divine or magical functions. In such a rite the part\r\nof the goddess might be played either by an image or a woman, and if\r\nby a woman, probably by the Queen. If there is any truth in this\r\nconjecture, we may suppose that the King and Queen of Rome\r\nmasqueraded as god and goddess at their marriage, exactly as the\r\nKing and Queen of Egypt appear to have done. The legend of Numa and\r\nEgeria points to a sacred grove rather than to a house as the scene\r\nof the nuptial union, which, like the marriage of the King and Queen\r\nof May, or of the vine-god and the Queen of Athens, may have been\r\nannually celebrated as a charm to ensure the fertility not only of\r\nthe earth but of man and beast. Now, according to some accounts, the\r\nscene of the marriage was no other than the sacred grove of Nemi,\r\nand on quite independent grounds we have been led to suppose that in\r\nthat same grove the King of the Wood was wedded to Diana. The\r\nconvergence of the two distinct lines of enquiry suggests that the\r\nlegendary union of the Roman king with Egeria may have been a\r\nreflection or duplicate of the union of the King of the Wood with\r\nEgeria or her double Diana. This does not imply that the Roman kings\r\never served as Kings of the Wood in the Arician grove, but only that\r\nthey may originally have been invested with a sacred character of\r\nthe same general kind, and may have held office on similar terms. To\r\nbe more explicit, it is possible that they reigned, not by right of\r\nbirth, but in virtue of their supposed divinity as representatives\r\nor embodiments of a god, and that as such they mated with a goddess,\r\nand had to prove their fitness from time to time to discharge their\r\ndivine functions by engaging in a severe bodily struggle, which may\r\noften have proved fatal to them, leaving the crown to their\r\nvictorious adversary. Our knowledge of the Roman kingship is far too\r\nscanty to allow us to affirm any one of these propositions with\r\nconfidence; but at least there are some scattered hints or\r\nindications of a similarity in all these respects between the\r\npriests of Nemi and the kings of Rome, or perhaps rather between\r\ntheir remote predecessors in the dark ages which preceded the dawn\r\nof legend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The King as Jupiter\r\n\r\nIN THE FIRST place, then, it would seem that the Roman king\r\npersonated no less a deity than Jupiter himself. For down to\r\nimperial times victorious generals celebrating a triumph, and\r\nmagistrates presiding at the games in the Circus, wore the costume\r\nof Jupiter, which was borrowed for the occasion from his great\r\ntemple on the Capitol; and it has been held with a high degree of\r\nprobability both by ancients and moderns that in so doing they\r\ncopied the traditionary attire and insignia of the Roman kings. They\r\nrode a chariot drawn by four laurel-crowned horses through the city,\r\nwhere every one else went on foot: they wore purple robes\r\nembroidered or spangled with gold: in the right hand they bore a\r\nbranch of laurel, and in the left hand an ivory sceptre topped with\r\nan eagle: a wreath of laurel crowned their brows: their face was\r\nreddened with vermilion; and over their head a slave held a heavy\r\ncrown of massy gold fashioned in the likeness of oak leaves. In this\r\nattire the assimilation of the man to the god comes out above all in\r\nthe eagle-topped sceptre, the oaken crown, and the reddened face.\r\nFor the eagle was the bird of Jove, the oak was his sacred tree, and\r\nthe face of his image standing in his four-horse chariot on the\r\nCapitol was in like manner regularly dyed red on festivals; indeed,\r\nso important was it deemed to keep the divine features properly\r\nrouged that one of the first duties of the censors was to contract\r\nfor having this done. As the triumphal procession always ended in\r\nthe temple of Jupiter on the Capitol, it was peculiarly appropriate\r\nthat the head of the victor should be graced by a crown of oak\r\nleaves, for not only was every oak consecrated to Jupiter, but the\r\nCapitoline temple of the god was said to have been built by Romulus\r\nbeside a sacred oak, venerated by shepherds, to which the king\r\nattached the spoils won by him from the enemy\'s general in battle.\r\nWe are expressly told that the oak crown was sacred to Capitoline\r\nJupiter; a passage of Ovid proves that it was regarded as the god\'s\r\nspecial emblem.\r\n\r\nAccording to a tradition which we have no reason to reject, Rome was\r\nfounded by settlers from Alba Longa, a city situated on the slope of\r\nthe Alban hills, overlooking the lake and the Campagna. Hence if the\r\nRoman kings claimed to be representatives or embodiments of Jupiter,\r\nthe god of the sky, of the thunder, and of the oak, it is natural to\r\nsuppose that the kings of Alba, from whom the founder of Rome traced\r\nhis descent, may have set up the same claim before them. Now the\r\nAlban dynasty bore the name of Silvii or Wood, and it can hardly be\r\nwithout significance that in the vision of the historic glories of\r\nRome revealed to Aeneas in the underworld, Virgil, an antiquary as\r\nwell as a poet, should represent all the line of Silvii as crowned\r\nwith oak. A chaplet of oak leaves would thus seem to have been part\r\nof the insignia of the old kings of Alba Longa as of their\r\nsuccessors the kings of Rome; in both cases it marked the monarch as\r\nthe human representative of the oak-god. The Roman annals record\r\nthat one of the kings of Alba, Romulus, Remulus, or Amulius Silvius\r\nby name, set up for being a god in his own person, the equal or\r\nsuperior of Jupiter. To support his pretensions and overawe his\r\nsubjects, he constructed machines whereby he mimicked the clap of\r\nthunder and the flash of lightning. Diodorus relates that in the\r\nseason of fruitage, when thunder is loud and frequent, the king\r\ncommanded his soldiers to drown the roar of heaven\'s artillery by\r\nclashing their swords against their shields. But he paid the penalty\r\nof his impiety, for he perished, he and his house, struck by a\r\nthunderbolt in the midst of a dreadful storm. Swollen by the rain,\r\nthe Alban lake rose in flood and drowned his palace. But still, says\r\nan ancient historian, when the water is low and the surface\r\nunruffled by a breeze, you may see the ruins of the palace at the\r\nbottom of the clear lake. Taken along with the similar story of\r\nSalmoneus, king of Elis, this legend points to a real custom\r\nobserved by the early kings of Greece and Italy, who, like their\r\nfellows in Africa down to modern times, may have been expected to\r\nproduce rain and thunder for the good of the crops. The priestly\r\nking Numa passed for an adept in the art of drawing down lightning\r\nfrom the sky. Mock thunder, we know, has been made by various\r\npeoples as a rain-charm in modern times; why should it not have been\r\nmade by kings in antiquity?\r\n\r\nThus, if the kings of Alba and Rome imitated Jupiter as god of the\r\noak by wearing a crown of oak leaves, they seem also to have copied\r\nhim in his character of a weather-god by pretending to make thunder\r\nand lightning. And if they did so, it is probable that, like Jupiter\r\nin heaven and many kings on earth, they also acted as public\r\nrain-makers, wringing showers from the dark sky by their\r\nenchantments whenever the parched earth cried out for the refreshing\r\nmoisture. At Rome the sluices of heaven were opened by means of a\r\nsacred stone, and the ceremony appears to have formed part of the\r\nritual of Jupiter Elicius, the god who elicits from the clouds the\r\nflashing lightning and the dripping rain. And who so well fitted to\r\nperform the ceremony as the king, the living representative of the\r\nsky-god?\r\n\r\nIf the kings of Rome aped Capitoline Jove, their predecessors the\r\nkings of Alba probably laid themselves out to mimic the great Latian\r\nJupiter, who had his seat above the city on the summit of the Alban\r\nMountain. Latinus, the legendary ancestor of the dynasty, was said\r\nto have been changed into Latian Jupiter after vanishing from the\r\nworld in the mysterious fashion characteristic of the old Latin\r\nkings. The sanctuary of the god on the top of the mountain was the\r\nreligious centre of the Latin League, as Alba was its political\r\ncapital till Rome wrested the supremacy from its ancient rival.\r\nApparently no temple, in our sense of the word, was ever erected to\r\nJupiter on this his holy mountain; as god of the sky and thunder he\r\nappropriately received the homage of his worshippers in the open\r\nair. The massive wall, of which some remains still enclose the old\r\ngarden of the Passionist monastery, seems to have been part of the\r\nsacred precinct which Tarquin the Proud, the last king of Rome,\r\nmarked out for the solemn annual assembly of the Latin League. The\r\ngod\'s oldest sanctuary on this airy mountain-top was a grove; and\r\nbearing in mind not merely the special consecration of the oak to\r\nJupiter, but also the traditional oak crown of the Alban kings and\r\nthe analogy of the Capitoline Jupiter at Rome, we may suppose that\r\nthe trees in the grove were oaks. We know that in antiquity Mount\r\nAlgidus, an outlying group of the Alban hills, was covered with dark\r\nforests of oak; and among the tribes who belonged to the Latin\r\nLeague in the earliest days, and were entitled to share the flesh of\r\nthe white bull sacrificed on the Alban Mount, there was one whose\r\nmembers styled themselves the Men of the Oak, doubtless on account\r\nof the woods among which they dwelt.\r\n\r\nBut we should err if we pictured to ourselves the country as covered\r\nin historical times with an unbroken forest of oaks. Theophrastus\r\nhas left us a description of the woods of Latium as they were in the\r\nfourth century before Christ. He says: "The land of the Latins is\r\nall moist. The plains produce laurels, myrtles, and wonderful\r\nbeeches; for they fell trees of such a size that a single stem\r\nsuffices for the keel of a Tyrrhenian ship. Pines and firs grow in\r\nthe mountains. What they call the land of Circe is a lofty headland\r\nthickly wooded with oak, myrtle, and luxuriant laurels. The natives\r\nsay that Circe dwelt there, and they show the grave of Elpenor, from\r\nwhich grow myrtles such as wreaths are made of, whereas the other\r\nmyrtle-trees are tall." Thus the prospect from the top of the Alban\r\nMount in the early days of Rome must have been very different in\r\nsome respects from what it is to-day. The purple Apennines, indeed,\r\nin their eternal calm on the one hand, and the shining Mediterranean\r\nin its eternal unrest on the other, no doubt looked then much as\r\nthey look now, whether bathed in sunshine, or chequered by the\r\nfleeting shadows of clouds; but instead of the desolate brown\r\nexpanse of the fever-stricken Campagna, spanned by its long lines of\r\nruined aqueducts, like the broken arches of the bridge in the vision\r\nof Mirza, the eye must have ranged over woodlands that stretched\r\naway, mile after mile, on all sides, till their varied hues of green\r\nor autumnal scarlet and gold melted insensibly into the blue of the\r\ndistant mountains and sea.\r\n\r\nBut Jupiter did not reign alone on the top of his holy mountain. He\r\nhad his consort with him, the goddess Juno, who was worshipped here\r\nunder the same title, Moneta, as on the Capitol at Rome. As the oak\r\ncrown was sacred to Jupiter and Juno on the Capitol, so we may\r\nsuppose it was on the Alban Mount, from which the Capitoline worship\r\nwas derived. Thus the oak-god would have his oak-goddess in the\r\nsacred oak grove. So at Dodona the oak-god Zeus was coupled with\r\nDione, whose very name is only a dialectically different form of\r\nJuno; and so on the top of Mount Cithaeron, as we have seen, he\r\nappears to have been periodically wedded to an oaken image of Hera.\r\nIt is probable, though it cannot be positively proved, that the\r\nsacred marriage of Jupiter and Juno was annually celebrated by all\r\nthe peoples of the Latin stock in the month which they named after\r\nthe goddess, the midsummer month of June.\r\n\r\nIf at any time of the year the Romans celebrated the sacred marriage\r\nof Jupiter and Juno, as the Greeks commonly celebrated the\r\ncorresponding marriage of Zeus and Hera, we may suppose that under\r\nthe Republic the ceremony was either performed over images of the\r\ndivine pair or acted by the Flamen Dialis and his wife the\r\nFlaminica. For the Flamen Dialis was the priest of Jove; indeed,\r\nancient and modern writers have regarded him, with much probability,\r\nas a living image of Jupiter, a human embodiment of the sky-god. In\r\nearlier times the Roman king, as representative of Jupiter, would\r\nnaturally play the part of the heavenly bridegroom at the sacred\r\nmarriage, while his queen would figure as the heavenly bride, just\r\nas in Egypt the king and queen masqueraded in the character of\r\ndeities, and as at Athens the queen annually wedded the vine-god\r\nDionysus. That the Roman king and queen should act the parts of\r\nJupiter and Juno would seem all the more natural because these\r\ndeities themselves bore the title of King and Queen.\r\n\r\nWhether that was so or not, the legend of Numa and Egeria appears to\r\nembody a reminiscence of a time when the priestly king himself\r\nplayed the part of the divine bridegroom; and as we have seen reason\r\nto suppose that the Roman kings personated the oak-god, while Egeria\r\nis expressly said to have been an oak-nymph, the story of their\r\nunion in the sacred grove raises a presumption that at Rome in the\r\nregal period a ceremony was periodically performed exactly analogous\r\nto that which was annually celebrated at Athens down to the time of\r\nAristotle. The marriage of the King of Rome to the oak-goddess, like\r\nthe wedding of the vine-god to the Queen of Athens, must have been\r\nintended to quicken the growth of vegetation by homoeopathic magic.\r\nOf the two forms of the rite we can hardly doubt that the Roman was\r\nthe older, and that long before the northern invaders met with the\r\nvine on the shores of the Mediterranean their forefathers had\r\nmarried the tree-god to the tree-goddess in the vast oak forests of\r\nCentral and Northern Europe. In the England of our day the forests\r\nhave mostly disappeared, yet still on many a village green and in\r\nmany a country lane a faded image of the sacred marriage lingers in\r\nthe rustic pageantry of May Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV. The Succession to the Kingdom in Ancient Latium\r\n\r\nIN REGARD to the Roman king, whose priestly functions were inherited\r\nby his successor the king of the Sacred Rites, the foregoing\r\ndiscussion has led us to the following conclusions. He represented\r\nand indeed personated Jupiter, the great god of the sky, the\r\nthunder, and the oak, and in that character made rain, thunder, and\r\nlightning for the good of his subjects, like many more kings of the\r\nweather in other parts of the world. Further, he not only mimicked\r\nthe oak-god by wearing an oak wreath and other insignia of divinity,\r\nbut he was married to an oak-nymph Egeria, who appears to have been\r\nmerely a local form of Diana in her character of a goddess of woods,\r\nof waters, and of child-birth. All these conclusions, which we have\r\nreached mainly by a consideration of the Roman evidence, may with\r\ngreat probability be applied to the other Latin communities. They\r\ntoo probably had of old their divine or priestly kings, who\r\ntransmitted their religious functions, without their civil powers,\r\nto their successors the Kings of the Sacred Rites.\r\n\r\nBut we have still to ask, What was the rule of succession to the\r\nkingdom among the old Latin tribes? According to tradition, there\r\nwere in all eight kings of Rome, and with regard to the five last of\r\nthem, at all events, we can hardly doubt that they actually sat on\r\nthe throne, and that the traditional history of their reigns is, in\r\nits main outlines, correct. Now it is very remarkable that though\r\nthe first king of Rome, Romulus, is said to have been descended from\r\nthe royal house of Alba, in which the kingship is represented as\r\nhereditary in the male line, not one of the Roman kings was\r\nimmediately succeeded by his son on the throne. Yet several left\r\nsons or grandsons behind them. On the other hand, one of them was\r\ndescended from a former king through his mother, not through his\r\nfather, and three of the kings, namely Tatius, the elder Tarquin,\r\nand Servius Tullius, were succeeded by their sons-in-law, who were\r\nall either foreigners or of foreign descent. This suggests that the\r\nright to the kingship was transmitted in the female line, and was\r\nactually exercised by foreigners who married the royal princesses.\r\nTo put it in technical language, the succession to the kingship at\r\nRome and probably in Latium generally would seem to have been\r\ndetermined by certain rules which have moulded early society in many\r\nparts of the world, namely exogamy, _beena_ marriage, and female\r\nkinship or mother-kin. Exogamy is the rule which obliges a man to\r\nmarry a woman of a different clan from his own: _beena_ marriage is\r\nthe rule that he must leave the home of his birth and live with his\r\nwife\'s people; and female kinship or mother-kin is the system of\r\ntracing relationship and transmitting the family name through women\r\ninstead of through men. If these principles regulated descent of the\r\nkingship among the ancient Latins, the state of things in this\r\nrespect would be somewhat as follows. The political and religious\r\ncentre of each community would be the perpetual fire on the king\'s\r\nhearth tended by Vestal Virgins of the royal clan. The king would be\r\na man of another clan, perhaps of another town or even of another\r\nrace, who had married a daughter of his predecessor and received the\r\nkingdom with her. The children whom he had by her would inherit\r\ntheir mother\'s name, not his; the daughters would remain at home;\r\nthe sons, when they grew up, would go away into the world, marry,\r\nand settle in their wives\' country, whether as kings or commoners.\r\nOf the daughters who stayed at home, some or all would be dedicated\r\nas Vestal Virgins for a longer or shorter time to the service of the\r\nfire on the hearth, and one of them would in time become the consort\r\nof her father\'s successor.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis has the advantage of explaining in a simple and\r\nnatural way some obscure features in the traditional history of the\r\nLatin kingship. Thus the legends which tell how Latin kings were\r\nborn of virgin mothers and divine fathers become at least more\r\nintelligible. For, stripped of their fabulous element, tales of this\r\nsort mean no more than that a woman has been gotten with child by a\r\nman unknown; and this uncertainty as to fatherhood is more easily\r\ncompatible with a system of kinship which ignores paternity than\r\nwith one which makes it all-important. If at the birth of the Latin\r\nkings their fathers were really unknown, the fact points either to a\r\ngeneral looseness of life in the royal family or to a special\r\nrelaxation of moral rules on certain occasions, when men and women\r\nreverted for a season to the licence of an earlier age. Such\r\nSaturnalias are not uncommon at some stages of social evolution. In\r\nour own country traces of them long survived in the practices of May\r\nDay and Whitsuntide, if not of Christmas. Children born of more or\r\nless promiscuous intercourse which characterises festivals of this\r\nkind would naturally be fathered on the god to whom the particular\r\nfestival was dedicated.\r\n\r\nIn this connexion it may be significant that a festival of jollity\r\nand drunkenness was celebrated by the plebeians and slaves at Rome\r\non Midsummer Day, and that the festival was specially associated\r\nwith the fireborn King Servius Tullius, being held in honour of\r\nFortuna, the goddess who loved Servius as Egeria loved Numa. The\r\npopular merrymakings at this season included foot-races and\r\nboat-races; the Tiber was gay with flower-wreathed boats, in which\r\nyoung folk sat quaffing wine. The festival appears to have been a\r\nsort of Midsummer Saturnalia answering to the real Saturnalia which\r\nfell at Midwinter. In modern Europe, as we shall learn later on, the\r\ngreat Midsummer festival has been above all a festival of lovers and\r\nof fire; one of its principal features is the pairing of\r\nsweethearts, who leap over the bonfires hand in hand or throw\r\nflowers across the flames to each other. And many omens of love and\r\nmarriage are drawn from the flowers which bloom at this mystic\r\nseason. It is the time of the roses and of love. Yet the innocence\r\nand beauty of such festivals in modern times ought not to blind us\r\nto the likelihood that in earlier days they were marked by coarser\r\nfeatures, which were probably of the essence of the rites. Indeed,\r\namong the rude Esthonian peasantry these features seem to have\r\nlingered down to our own generation, if not to the present day. One\r\nother feature in the Roman celebration of Midsummer deserves to be\r\nspecially noticed. The custom of rowing in flower-decked boats on\r\nthe river on this day proves that it was to some extent a water\r\nfestival; and water has always, down to modern times, played a\r\nconspicuous part in the rites of Midsummer Day, which explains why\r\nthe Church, in throwing its cloak over the old heathen festival,\r\nchose to dedicate it to St. John the Baptist.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis that the Latin kings may have been begotten at an\r\nannual festival of love is necessarily a mere conjecture, though the\r\ntraditional birth of Numa at the festival of the Parilia, when\r\nshepherds leaped across the spring bonfires, as lovers leap across\r\nthe Midsummer fires, may perhaps be thought to lend it a faint\r\ncolour of probability. But it is quite possible that the uncertainty\r\nas to their fathers may not have arisen till long after the death of\r\nthe kings, when their figures began to melt away into the cloudland\r\nof fable, assuming fantastic shapes and gorgeous colouring as they\r\npassed from earth to heaven. If they were alien immigrants,\r\nstrangers and pilgrims in the land they ruled over, it would be\r\nnatural enough that the people should forget their lineage, and\r\nforgetting it should provide them with another, which made up in\r\nlustre what it lacked in truth. The final apotheosis, which\r\nrepresented the kings not merely as sprung from gods but as\r\nthemselves deities incarnate, would be much facilitated if in their\r\nlifetime, as we have seen reason to think, they had actually laid\r\nclaim to divinity.\r\n\r\nIf among the Latins the women of royal blood always stayed at home\r\nand received as their consorts men of another stock, and often of\r\nanother country, who reigned as kings in virtue of their marriage\r\nwith a native princess, we can understand not only why foreigners\r\nwore the crown at Rome, but also why foreign names occur in the list\r\nof the Alban kings. In a state of society where nobility is reckoned\r\nonly through women--in other words, where descent through the mother\r\nis everything, and descent through the father is nothing--no\r\nobjection will be felt to uniting girls of the highest rank to men\r\nof humble birth, even to aliens or slaves, provided that in\r\nthemselves the men appear to be suitable mates. What really matters\r\nis that the royal stock, on which the prosperity and even the\r\nexistence of the people is supposed to depend, should be perpetuated\r\nin a vigorous and efficient form, and for this purpose it is\r\nnecessary that the women of the royal family should bear children to\r\nmen who are physically and mentally fit, according to the standard\r\nof early society, to discharge the important duty of procreation.\r\nThus the personal qualities of the kings at this stage of social\r\nevolution are deemed of vital importance. If they, like their\r\nconsorts, are of royal and divine descent, so much the better; but\r\nit is not essential that they should be so.\r\n\r\nAt Athens, as at Rome, we find traces of succession to the throne by\r\nmarriage with a royal princess; for two of the most ancient kings of\r\nAthens, namely Cecrops and Amphictyon, are said to have married the\r\ndaughters of their predecessors. This tradition is to a certain\r\nextent confirmed by evidence, pointing to the conclusion that at\r\nAthens male kinship was preceded by female kinship.\r\n\r\nFurther, if I am right in supposing that in ancient Latium the royal\r\nfamilies kept their daughters at home and sent forth their sons to\r\nmarry princesses and reign among their wives\' people, it will follow\r\nthat the male descendants would reign in successive generations over\r\ndifferent kingdoms. Now this seems to have happened both in ancient\r\nGreece and in ancient Sweden; from which we may legitimately infer\r\nthat it was a custom practised by more than one branch of the Aryan\r\nstock in Europe. Many Greek traditions relate how a prince left his\r\nnative land, and going to a far country married the king\'s daughter\r\nand succeeded to the kingdom. Various reasons are assigned by\r\nancient Greek writers for these migrations of the princes. A common\r\none is that the king\'s son had been banished for murder. This would\r\nexplain very well why he fled his own land, but it is no reason at\r\nall why he should become king of another. We may suspect that such\r\nreasons are afterthoughts devised by writers, who, accustomed to the\r\nrule that a son should succeed to his father\'s property and kingdom,\r\nwere hard put to it to account for so many traditions of kings\' sons\r\nwho quitted the land of their birth to reign over a foreign kingdom.\r\nIn Scandinavian tradition we meet with traces of similar customs.\r\nFor we read of daughters\' husbands who received a share of the\r\nkingdoms of their royal fathers-in-law, even when these\r\nfathers-in-law had sons of their own; in particular, during the five\r\ngenerations which preceded Harold the Fair-haired, male members of\r\nthe Ynglingar family, which is said to have come from Sweden, are\r\nreported in the _Heimskringla_ or _Sagas of the Norwegian Kings_ to\r\nhave obtained at least six provinces in Norway by marriage with the\r\ndaughters of the local kings.\r\n\r\nThus it would seem that among some Aryan peoples, at a certain stage\r\nof their social evolution, it has been customary to regard women and\r\nnot men as the channels in which royal blood flows, and to bestow\r\nthe kingdom in each successive generation on a man of another\r\nfamily, and often of another country, who marries one of the\r\nprincesses and reigns over his wife\'s people. A common type of\r\npopular tale, which relates how an adventurer, coming to a strange\r\nland, wins the hand of the king\'s daughter and with her the half or\r\nthe whole of the kingdom, may well be a reminiscence of a real\r\ncustom.\r\n\r\nWhere usages and ideas of this sort prevail, it is obvious that the\r\nkingship is merely an appanage of marriage with a woman of the blood\r\nroyal. The old Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus puts this view of\r\nthe kingship very clearly in the mouth of Hermutrude, a legendary\r\nqueen of Scotland. "Indeed she was a queen," says Hermutrude, "and\r\nbut that her sex gainsaid it, might be deemed a king; nay (and this\r\nis yet truer), whomsoever she thought worthy of her bed was at once\r\na king, and she yielded her kingdom with herself. Thus her sceptre\r\nand her hand went together." The statement is all the more\r\nsignificant because it appears to reflect the actual practice of the\r\nPictish kings. We know from the testimony of Bede that, whenever a\r\ndoubt arose as to the succession, the Picts chose their kings from\r\nthe female rather than the male line.\r\n\r\nThe personal qualities which recommended a man for a royal alliance\r\nand succession to the throne would naturally vary according to the\r\npopular ideas of the time and the character of the king or his\r\nsubstitute, but it is reasonable to suppose that among them in early\r\nsociety physical strength and beauty would hold a prominent place.\r\n\r\nSometimes apparently the right to the hand of the princess and to\r\nthe throne has been determined by a race. The Alitemnian Libyans\r\nawarded the kingdom to the fleetest runner. Amongst the old\r\nPrussians, candidates for nobility raced on horseback to the king,\r\nand the one who reached him first was ennobled. According to\r\ntradition the earliest games at Olympia were held by Endymion, who\r\nset his sons to run a race for the kingdom. His tomb was said to be\r\nat the point of the racecourse from which the runners started. The\r\nfamous story of Pelops and Hippodamia is perhaps only another\r\nversion of the legend that the first races at Olympia were run for\r\nno less a prize than a kingdom.\r\n\r\nThese traditions may very well reflect a real custom of racing for a\r\nbride, for such a custom appears to have prevailed among various\r\npeoples, though in practice it has degenerated into a mere form or\r\npretence. Thus "there is one race, called the \'Love Chase,\' which\r\nmay be considered a part of the form of marriage among the Kirghiz.\r\nIn this the bride, armed with a formidable whip, mounts a fleet\r\nhorse, and is pursued by all the young men who make any pretensions\r\nto her hand. She will be given as a prize to the one who catches\r\nher, but she has the right, besides urging on her horse to the\r\nutmost, to use her whip, often with no mean force, to keep off those\r\nlovers who are unwelcome to her, and she will probably favour the\r\none whom she has already chosen in her heart." The race for the\r\nbride is found also among the Koryaks of North-eastern Asia. It\r\ntakes place in a large tent, round which many separate compartments\r\ncalled _pologs_ are arranged in a continuous circle. The girl gets a\r\nstart and is clear of the marriage if she can run through all the\r\ncompartments without being caught by the bridegroom. The women of\r\nthe encampment place every obstacle in the man\'s way, tripping him\r\nup, belabouring him with switches, and so forth, so that he has\r\nlittle chance of succeeding unless the girl wishes it and waits for\r\nhim. Similar customs appear to have been practised by all the\r\nTeutonic peoples; for the German, Anglo-Saxon, and Norse languages\r\npossess in common a word for marriage which means simply bride-race.\r\nMoreover, traces of the custom survived into modern times.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that the right to marry a girl, and especially a\r\nprincess, has often been conferred as a prize in an athletic\r\ncontest. There would be no reason, therefore, for surprise if the\r\nRoman kings, before bestowing their daughters in marriage, should\r\nhave resorted to this ancient mode of testing the personal qualities\r\nof their future sons-in-law and successors. If my theory is correct,\r\nthe Roman king and queen personated Jupiter and his divine consort,\r\nand in the character of these divinities went through the annual\r\nceremony of a sacred marriage for the purpose of causing the crops\r\nto grow and men and cattle to be fruitful and multiply. Thus they\r\ndid what in more northern lands we may suppose the King and Queen of\r\nMay were believed to do in days of old. Now we have seen that the\r\nright to play the part of the King of May and to wed the Queen of\r\nMay has sometimes been determined by an athletic contest,\r\nparticularly by a race. This may have been a relic of an old\r\nmarriage custom of the sort we have examined, a custom designed to\r\ntest the fitness of a candidate for matrimony. Such a test might\r\nreasonably be applied with peculiar rigour to the king in order to\r\nensure that no personal defect should incapacitate him for the\r\nperformance of those sacred rites and ceremonies on which, even more\r\nthan on the despatch of his civil and military duties, the safety\r\nand prosperity of the community were believed to depend. And it\r\nwould be natural to require of him that from time to time he should\r\nsubmit himself afresh to the same ordeal for the sake of publicly\r\ndemonstrating that he was still equal to the discharge of his high\r\ncalling. A relic of that test perhaps survived in the ceremony known\r\nas the Flight of the King (_regifugium_), which continued to be\r\nannually observed at Rome down to imperial times. On the\r\ntwenty-fourth day of February a sacrifice used to be offered in the\r\nComitium, and when it was over the King of the Sacred Rites fled\r\nfrom the Forum. We may conjecture that the Flight of the King was\r\noriginally a race for an annual kingship, which may have been\r\nawarded as a prize to the fleetest runner. At the end of the year\r\nthe king might run again for a second term of office; and so on,\r\nuntil he was defeated and deposed or perhaps slain. In this way what\r\nhad once been a race would tend to assume the character of a flight\r\nand a pursuit. The king would be given a start; he ran and his\r\ncompetitors ran after him, and if he were overtaken he had to yield\r\nthe crown and perhaps his life to the lightest of foot among them.\r\nIn time a man of masterful character might succeed in seating\r\nhimself permanently on the throne and reducing the annual race or\r\nflight to the empty form which it seems always to have been within\r\nhistorical times. The rite was sometimes interpreted as a\r\ncommemoration of the expulsion of the kings from Rome; but this\r\nappears to have been a mere afterthought devised to explain a\r\nceremony of which the old meaning was forgotten. It is far more\r\nlikely that in acting thus the King of the Sacred Rites was merely\r\nkeeping up an ancient custom which in the regal period had been\r\nannually observed by his predecessors the kings. What the original\r\nintention of the rite may have been must probably always remain more\r\nor less a matter of conjecture. The present explanation is suggested\r\nwith a full sense of the difficulty and obscurity in which the\r\nsubject is involved.\r\n\r\nThus if my theory is correct, the yearly flight of the Roman king\r\nwas a relic of a time when the kingship was an annual office\r\nawarded, along with the hand of a princess, to the victorious\r\nathlete or gladiator, who thereafter figured along with his bride as\r\na god and goddess at a sacred marriage designed to ensure the\r\nfertility of the earth by homoeopathic magic. If I am right in\r\nsupposing that in very early times the old Latin kings personated a\r\ngod and were regularly put to death in that character, we can better\r\nunderstand the mysterious or violent ends to which so many of them\r\nare said to have come. We have seen that, according to tradition,\r\none of the kings of Alba was killed by a thunderbolt for impiously\r\nmimicking the thunder of Jupiter. Romulus is said to have vanished\r\nmysteriously like Aeneas, or to have been cut to pieces by the\r\npatricians whom he had offended, and the seventh of July, the day on\r\nwhich he perished, was a festival which bore some resemblance to the\r\nSaturnalia. For on that day the female slaves were allowed to take\r\ncertain remarkable liberties. They dressed up as free women in the\r\nattire of matrons and maids, and in this guise they went forth from\r\nthe city, scoffed and jeered at all whom they met, and engaged among\r\nthemselves in a fight, striking and throwing stones at each other.\r\nAnother Roman king who perished by violence was Tatius, the Sabine\r\ncolleague of Romulus. It is said that he was at Lavinium offering a\r\npublic sacrifice to the ancestral gods, when some men, to whom he\r\nhad given umbrage, despatched him with the sacrificial knives and\r\nspits which they had snatched from the altar. The occasion and the\r\nmanner of his death suggest that the slaughter may have been a\r\nsacrifice rather than an assassination. Again, Tullus Hostilius, the\r\nsuccessor of Numa, was commonly said to have been killed by\r\nlightning, but many held that he was murdered at the instigation of\r\nAncus Marcius, who reigned after him. Speaking of the more or less\r\nmythical Numa, the type of the priestly king, Plutarch observes that\r\n"his fame was enhanced by the fortunes of the later kings. For of\r\nthe five who reigned after him the last was deposed and ended his\r\nlife in exile, and of the remaining four not one died a natural\r\ndeath; for three of them were assassinated and Tullus Hostilius was\r\nconsumed by thunderbolts."\r\n\r\nThese legends of the violent ends of the Roman kings suggest that\r\nthe contest by which they gained the throne may sometimes have been\r\na mortal combat rather than a race. If that were so, the analogy\r\nwhich we have traced between Rome and Nemi would be still closer. At\r\nboth places the sacred kings, the living representatives of the\r\ngodhead, would thus be liable to suffer deposition and death at the\r\nhand of any resolute man who could prove his divine right to the\r\nholy office by the strong arm and the sharp sword. It would not be\r\nsurprising if among the early Latins the claim to the kingdom should\r\noften have been settled by single combat; for down to historical\r\ntimes the Umbrians regularly submitted their private disputes to the\r\nordeal of battle, and he who cut his adversary\'s throat was thought\r\nthereby to have proved the justice of his cause beyond the reach of\r\ncavil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV. The Worship of the Oak\r\n\r\nTHE WORSHIP of the oak tree or of the oak god appears to have been\r\nshared by all the branches of the Aryan stock in Europe. Both Greeks\r\nand Italians associated the tree with their highest god, Zeus or\r\nJupiter, the divinity of the sky, the rain, and the thunder. Perhaps\r\nthe oldest and certainly one of the most famous sanctuaries in\r\nGreece was that of Dodona, where Zeus was revered in the oracular\r\noak. The thunder-storms which are said to rage at Dodona more\r\nfrequently than anywhere else in Europe, would render the spot a\r\nfitting home for the god whose voice was heard alike in the rustling\r\nof the oak leaves and in the crash of thunder. Perhaps the bronze\r\ngongs which kept up a humming in the wind round the sanctuary were\r\nmeant to mimick the thunder that might so often be heard rolling and\r\nrumbling in the coombs of the stern and barren mountains which shut\r\nin the gloomy valley. In Boeotia, as we have seen, the sacred\r\nmarriage of Zeus and Hera, the oak god and the oak goddess, appears\r\nto have been celebrated with much pomp by a religious federation of\r\nstates. And on Mount Lycaeus in Arcadia the character of Zeus as god\r\nboth of the oak and of the rain comes out clearly in the rain charm\r\npractised by the priest of Zeus, who dipped an oak branch in a\r\nsacred spring. In his latter capacity Zeus was the god to whom the\r\nGreeks regularly prayed for rain. Nothing could be more natural; for\r\noften, though not always, he had his seat on the mountains where the\r\nclouds gather and the oaks grow. On the Acropolis at Athens there\r\nwas an image of Earth praying to Zeus for rain. And in time of\r\ndrought the Athenians themselves prayed, "Rain, rain, O dear Zeus,\r\non the cornland of the Athenians and on the plains."\r\n\r\nAgain, Zeus wielded the thunder and lightning as well as the rain.\r\nAt Olympia and elsewhere he was worshipped under the surname of\r\nThunderbolt; and at Athens there was a sacrificial hearth of\r\nLightning Zeus on the city wall, where some priestly officials\r\nwatched for lightning over Mount Parnes at certain seasons of the\r\nyear. Further, spots which had been struck by lightning were\r\nregularly fenced in by the Greeks and consecrated to Zeus the\r\nDescender, that is, to the god who came down in the flash from\r\nheaven. Altars were set up within these enclosures and sacrifices\r\noffered on them. Several such places are known from inscriptions to\r\nhave existed in Athens.\r\n\r\nThus when ancient Greek kings claimed to be descended from Zeus, and\r\neven to bear his name, we may reasonably suppose that they also\r\nattempted to exercise his divine functions by making thunder and\r\nrain for the good of their people or the terror and confusion of\r\ntheir foes. In this respect the legend of Salmoneus probably\r\nreflects the pretensions of a whole class of petty sovereigns who\r\nreigned of old, each over his little canton, in the oak-clad\r\nhighlands of Greece. Like their kinsmen the Irish kings, they were\r\nexpected to be a source of fertility to the land and of fecundity to\r\nthe cattle; and how could they fulfil these expectations better than\r\nby acting the part of their kinsman Zeus, the great god of the oak,\r\nthe thunder, and the rain? They personified him, apparently, just as\r\nthe Italian kings personified Jupiter.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Italy every oak was sacred to Jupiter, the Italian\r\ncounterpart of Zeus; and on the Capitol at Rome the god was\r\nworshipped as the deity not merely of the oak, but of the rain and\r\nthe thunder. Contrasting the piety of the good old times with the\r\nscepticism of an age when nobody thought that heaven was heaven, or\r\ncared a fig for Jupiter, a Roman writer tells us that in former days\r\nnoble matrons used to go with bare feet, streaming hair, and pure\r\nminds, up the long Capitoline slope, praying to Jupiter for rain.\r\nAnd straightway, he goes on, it rained bucketsful, then or never,\r\nand everybody returned dripping like drowned rats. "But nowadays,"\r\nsays he, "we are no longer religious, so the fields lie baking."\r\n\r\nWhen we pass from Southern to Central Europe we still meet with the\r\ngreat god of the oak and the thunder among the barbarous Aryans who\r\ndwelt in the vast primaeval forests. Thus among the Celts of Gaul\r\nthe Druids esteemed nothing more sacred than the mistletoe and the\r\noak on which it grew; they chose groves of oaks for the scene of\r\ntheir solemn service, and they performed none of their rites without\r\noak leaves. "The Celts," says a Greek writer, "worship Zeus, and the\r\nCeltic image of Zeus is a tall oak." The Celtic conquerors, who\r\nsettled in Asia in the third century before our era, appear to have\r\ncarried the worship of the oak with them to their new home; for in\r\nthe heart of Asia Minor the Galatian senate met in a place which\r\nbore the pure Celtic name of Drynemetum, "the sacred oak grove" or\r\n"the temple of the oak." Indeed the very name of Druids is believed\r\nby good authorities to mean no more than "oak men."\r\n\r\nIn the religion of the ancient Germans the veneration for sacred\r\ngroves seems to have held the foremost place, and according to Grimm\r\nthe chief of their holy trees was the oak. It appears to have been\r\nespecially dedicated to the god of thunder, Donar or Thunar, the\r\nequivalent of the Norse Thor; for a sacred oak near Geismar, in\r\nHesse, which Boniface cut down in the eighth century, went among the\r\nheathen by the name of Jupiter\'s oak (_robur Jovis_), which in old\r\nGerman would be _Donares eih,_ "the oak of Donar." That the Teutonic\r\nthunder god Donar, Thunar, Thor was identified with the Italian\r\nthunder god Jupiter appears from our word Thursday, Thunar\'s day,\r\nwhich is merely a rendering of the Latin _dies Jovis._ Thus among\r\nthe ancient Teutons, as among the Greeks and Italians, the god of\r\nthe oak was also the god of the thunder. Moreover, he was regarded\r\nas the great fertilising power, who sent rain and caused the earth\r\nto bear fruit; for Adam of Bremen tells us that "Thor presides in\r\nthe air; he it is who rules thunder and lightning, wind and rains,\r\nfine weather and crops." In these respects, therefore, the Teutonic\r\nthunder god again resembled his southern counterparts Zeus and\r\nJupiter.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Slavs also the oak appears to have been the sacred tree\r\nof the thunder god Perun, the counterpart of Zeus and Jupiter. It is\r\nsaid that at Novgorod there used to stand an image of Perun in the\r\nlikeness of a man with a thunder-stone in his hand. A fire of oak\r\nwood burned day and night in his honour; and if ever it went out the\r\nattendants paid for their negligence with their lives. Perun seems,\r\nlike Zeus and Jupiter, to have been the chief god of his people; for\r\nProcopius tells us that the Slavs "believe that one god, the maker\r\nof lightning, is alone lord of all things, and they sacrifice to him\r\noxen and every victim."\r\n\r\nThe chief deity of the Lithuanians was Perkunas or Perkuns, the god\r\nof thunder and lightning, whose resemblance to Zeus and Jupiter has\r\noften been pointed out. Oaks were sacred to him, and when they were\r\ncut down by the Christian missionaries, the people loudly complained\r\nthat their sylvan deities were destroyed. Perpetual fires, kindled\r\nwith the wood of certain oak-trees, were kept up in honour of\r\nPerkunas; if such a fire went out, it was lighted again by friction\r\nof the sacred wood. Men sacrificed to oak-trees for good crops,\r\nwhile women did the same to lime-trees; from which we may infer that\r\nthey regarded oaks as male and lime-trees as female. And in time of\r\ndrought, when they wanted rain, they used to sacrifice a black\r\nheifer, a black he-goat, and a black cock to the thunder god in the\r\ndepths of the woods. On such occasions the people assembled in great\r\nnumbers from the country round about, ate and drank, and called upon\r\nPerkunas. They carried a bowl of beer thrice round the fire, then\r\npoured the liquor on the flames, while they prayed to the god to\r\nsend showers. Thus the chief Lithuanian deity presents a close\r\nresemblance to Zeus and Jupiter, since he was the god of the oak,\r\nthe thunder, and the rain.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing survey it appears that a god of the oak, the\r\nthunder, and the rain was worshipped of old by all the main branches\r\nof the Aryan stock in Europe, and was indeed the chief deity of\r\ntheir pantheon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI. Dianus and Diana\r\n\r\nIN THIS CHAPTER I propose to recapitulate the conclusions to which\r\nthe enquiry has thus far led us, and drawing together the scattered\r\nrays of light, to turn them on the dark figure of the priest of\r\nNemi.\r\n\r\nWe have found that at an early stage of society men, ignorant of the\r\nsecret processes of nature and of the narrow limits within which it\r\nis in our power to control and direct them, have commonly arrogated\r\nto themselves functions which in the present state of knowledge we\r\nshould deem superhuman or divine. The illusion has been fostered and\r\nmaintained by the same causes which begot it, namely, the marvellous\r\norder and uniformity with which nature conducts her operations, the\r\nwheels of her great machine revolving with a smoothness and\r\nprecision which enable the patient observer to anticipate in general\r\nthe season, if not the very hour, when they will bring round the\r\nfulfilment of his hopes or the accomplishment of his fears. The\r\nregularly recurring events of this great cycle, or rather series of\r\ncycles, soon stamp themselves even on the dull mind of the savage.\r\nHe foresees them, and foreseeing them mistakes the desired\r\nrecurrence for an effect of his own will, and the dreaded recurrence\r\nfor an effect of the will of his enemies. Thus the springs which set\r\nthe vast machine in motion, though they lie far beyond our ken,\r\nshrouded in a mystery which we can never hope to penetrate, appear\r\nto ignorant man to lie within his reach: he fancies he can touch\r\nthem and so work by magic art all manner of good to himself and evil\r\nto his foes. In time the fallacy of this belief becomes apparent to\r\nhim: he discovers that there are things he cannot do, pleasures\r\nwhich he is unable of himself to procure, pains which even the most\r\npotent magician is powerless to avoid. The unattainable good, the\r\ninevitable ill, are now ascribed by him to the action of invisible\r\npowers, whose favour is joy and life, whose anger is misery and\r\ndeath. Thus magic tends to be displaced by religion, and the\r\nsorcerer by the priest. At this stage of thought the ultimate causes\r\nof things are conceived to be personal beings, many in number and\r\noften discordant in character, who partake of the nature and even of\r\nthe frailty of man, though their might is greater than his, and\r\ntheir life far exceeds the span of his ephemeral existence. Their\r\nsharply-marked individualities, their clear-cut outlines have not\r\nyet begun, under the powerful solvent of philosophy, to melt and\r\ncoalesce into that single unknown substratum of phenomena which,\r\naccording to the qualities with which our imagination invests it,\r\ngoes by one or other of the high-sounding names which the wit of man\r\nhas devised to hide his ignorance. Accordingly, so long as men look\r\non their gods as beings akin to themselves and not raised to an\r\nunapproachable height above them, they believe it to be possible for\r\nthose of their own number who surpass their fellows to attain to the\r\ndivine rank after death or even in life. Incarnate human deities of\r\nthis latter sort may be said to halt midway between the age of magic\r\nand the age of religion. If they bear the names and display the pomp\r\nof deities, the powers which they are supposed to wield are commonly\r\nthose of their predecessor the magician. Like him, they are expected\r\nto guard their people against hostile enchantments, to heal them in\r\nsickness, to bless them with offspring, and to provide them with an\r\nabundant supply of food by regulating the weather and performing the\r\nother ceremonies which are deemed necessary to ensure the fertility\r\nof the earth and the multiplication of animals. Men who are credited\r\nwith powers so lofty and far-reaching naturally hold the highest\r\nplace in the land, and while the rift between the spiritual and the\r\ntemporal spheres has not yet widened too far, they are supreme in\r\ncivil as well as religious matters: in a word, they are kings as\r\nwell as gods. Thus the divinity which hedges a king has its roots\r\ndeep down in human history, and long ages pass before these are\r\nsapped by a profounder view of nature and man.\r\n\r\nIn the classical period of Greek and Latin antiquity the reign of\r\nkings was for the most part a thing of the past; yet the stories of\r\ntheir lineage, titles, and pretensions suffice to prove that they\r\ntoo claimed to rule by divine right and to exercise superhuman\r\npowers. Hence we may without undue temerity assume that the King of\r\nthe Wood at Nemi, though shorn in later times of his glory and\r\nfallen on evil days, represented a long line of sacred kings who had\r\nonce received not only the homage but the adoration of their\r\nsubjects in return for the manifold blessings which they were\r\nsupposed to dispense. What little we know of the functions of Diana\r\nin the Arician grove seems to prove that she was here conceived as a\r\ngoddess of fertility, and particularly as a divinity of childbirth.\r\nIt is reasonable, therefore, to suppose that in the discharge of\r\nthese important duties she was assisted by her priest, the two\r\nfiguring as King and Queen of the Wood in a solemn marriage, which\r\nwas intended to make the earth gay with the blossoms of spring and\r\nthe fruits of autumn, and to gladden the hearts of men and women\r\nwith healthful offspring.\r\n\r\nIf the priest of Nemi posed not merely as a king, but as a god of\r\nthe grove, we have still to ask, What deity in particular did he\r\npersonate? The answer of antiquity is that he represented Virbius,\r\nthe consort or lover of Diana. But this does not help us much, for\r\nof Virbius we know little more than the name. A clue to the mystery\r\nis perhaps supplied by the Vestal fire which burned in the grove.\r\nFor the perpetual holy fires of the Aryans in Europe appear to have\r\nbeen commonly kindled and fed with oak-wood, and in Rome itself, not\r\nmany miles from Nemi, the fuel of the Vestal fire consisted of oaken\r\nsticks or logs, as has been proved by a microscopic analysis of the\r\ncharred embers of the Vestal fire, which were discovered by\r\nCommendatore G. Boni in the course of the memorable excavations\r\nwhich he conducted in the Roman forum at the end of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. But the ritual of the various Latin towns seems to have\r\nbeen marked by great uniformity; hence it is reasonable to conclude\r\nthat wherever in Latium a Vestal fire was maintained, it was fed, as\r\nat Rome, with wood of the sacred oak. If this was so at Nemi, it\r\nbecomes probable that the hallowed grove there consisted of a\r\nnatural oak-wood, and that therefore the tree which the King of the\r\nWood had to guard at the peril of his life was itself an oak;\r\nindeed, it was from an evergreen oak, according to Virgil, that\r\nAeneas plucked the Golden Bough. Now the oak was the sacred tree of\r\nJupiter, the supreme god of the Latins. Hence it follows that the\r\nKing of the Wood, whose life was bound up in a fashion with an oak,\r\npersonated no less a deity than Jupiter himself. At least the\r\nevidence, slight as it is, seems to point to this conclusion. The\r\nold Alban dynasty of the Silvii or Woods, with their crown of oak\r\nleaves, apparently aped the style and emulated the powers of Latian\r\nJupiter, who dwelt on the top of the Alban Mount. It is not\r\nimpossible that the King of the Wood, who guarded the sacred oak a\r\nlittle lower down the mountain, was the lawful successor and\r\nrepresentative of this ancient line of the Silvii or Woods. At all\r\nevents, if I am right in supposing that he passed for a human\r\nJupiter, it would appear that Virbius, with whom legend identified\r\nhim, was nothing but a local form of Jupiter, considered perhaps in\r\nhis original aspect as a god of the greenwood.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis that in later times at all events the King of the\r\nWood played the part of the oak god Jupiter, is confirmed by an\r\nexamination of his divine partner Diana. For two distinct lines of\r\nargument converge to show that if Diana was a queen of the woods in\r\ngeneral, she was at Nemi a goddess of the oak in particular. In the\r\nfirst place, she bore the title of Vesta, and as such presided over\r\na perpetual fire, which we have seen reason to believe was fed with\r\noak wood. But a goddess of fire is not far removed from a goddess of\r\nthe fuel which burns in the fire; primitive thought perhaps drew no\r\nsharp line of distinction between the blaze and the wood that\r\nblazes. In the second place, the nymph Egeria at Nemi appears to\r\nhave been merely a form of Diana, and Egeria is definitely said to\r\nhave been a Dryad, a nymph of the oak. Elsewhere in Italy the\r\ngoddess had her home on oak-clad mountains. Thus Mount Algidus, a\r\nspur of the Alban hills, was covered in antiquity with dark forests\r\nof oak, both of the evergreen and the deciduous sort. In winter the\r\nsnow lay long on these cold hills, and their gloomy oak-woods were\r\nbelieved to be a favourite haunt of Diana, as they have been of\r\nbrigands in modern times. Again, Mount Tifata, the long abrupt ridge\r\nof the Apennines which looks down on the Campanian plain behind\r\nCapua, was wooded of old with evergreen oaks, among which Diana had\r\na temple. Here Sulla thanked the goddess for his victory over the\r\nMarians in the plain below, attesting his gratitude by inscriptions\r\nwhich were long afterwards to be seen in the temple. On the whole,\r\nthen, we conclude that at Nemi the King of the Wood personated the\r\noak-god Jupiter and mated with the oak-goddess Diana in the sacred\r\ngrove. An echo of their mystic union has come down to us in the\r\nlegend of the loves of Numa and Egeria, who according to some had\r\ntheir trysting-place in these holy woods.\r\n\r\nTo this theory it may naturally be objected that the divine consort\r\nof Jupiter was not Diana but Juno, and that if Diana had a mate at\r\nall he might be expected to bear the name not of Jupiter, but of\r\nDianus or Janus, the latter of these forms being merely a corruption\r\nof the former. All this is true, but the objection may be parried by\r\nobserving that the two pairs of deities, Jupiter and Juno on the one\r\nside, and Dianus and Diana, or Janus and Jana, on the other side,\r\nare merely duplicates of each other, their names and their functions\r\nbeing in substance and origin identical. With regard to their names,\r\nall four of them come from the same Aryan root _DI,_ meaning\r\n"bright," which occurs in the names of the corresponding Greek\r\ndeities, Zeus and his old female consort Dione. In regard to their\r\nfunctions, Juno and Diana were both goddesses of fecundity and\r\nchildbirth, and both were sooner or later identified with the moon.\r\nAs to the true nature and functions of Janus the ancients themselves\r\nwere puzzled; and where they hesitated, it is not for us confidently\r\nto decide. But the view mentioned by Varro that Janus was the god of\r\nthe sky is supported not only by the etymological identity of his\r\nname with that of the sky-god Jupiter, but also by the relation in\r\nwhich he appears to have stood to Jupiter\'s two mates, Juno and\r\nJuturna. For the epithet Junonian bestowed on Janus points to a\r\nmarriage union between the two deities; and according to one account\r\nJanus was the husband of the water-nymph Juturna, who according to\r\nothers was beloved by Jupiter. Moreover, Janus, like Jove, was\r\nregularly invoked, and commonly spoken of under the title of Father.\r\nIndeed, he was identified with Jupiter not merely by the logic of\r\nthe learned St. Augustine, but by the piety of a pagan worshipper\r\nwho dedicated an offering to Jupiter Dianus. A trace of his relation\r\nto the oak may be found in the oakwoods of the Janiculum, the hill\r\non the right bank of the Tiber, where Janus is said to have reigned\r\nas a king in the remotest ages of Italian history.\r\n\r\nThus, if I am right, the same ancient pair of deities was variously\r\nknown among the Greek and Italian peoples as Zeus and Dione, Jupiter\r\nand Juno, or Dianus (Janus) and Diana (Jana), the names of the\r\ndivinities being identical in substance, though varying in form with\r\nthe dialect of the particular tribe which worshipped them. At first,\r\nwhen the peoples dwelt near each other, the difference between the\r\ndeities would be hardly more than one of name; in other words, it\r\nwould be almost purely dialectical. But the gradual dispersion of\r\nthe tribes, and their consequent isolation from each other, would\r\nfavour the growth of divergent modes of conceiving and worshipping\r\nthe gods whom they had carried with them from their old home, so\r\nthat in time discrepancies of myth and ritual would tend to spring\r\nup and thereby to convert a nominal into a real distinction between\r\nthe divinities. Accordingly when, with the slow progress of culture,\r\nthe long period of barbarism and separation was passing away, and\r\nthe rising political power of a single strong community had begun to\r\ndraw or hammer its weaker neighbours into a nation, the confluent\r\npeoples would throw their gods, like their dialects, into a common\r\nstock; and thus it might come about that the same ancient deities,\r\nwhich their forefathers had worshipped together before the\r\ndispersion, would now be so disguised by the accumulated effect of\r\ndialectical and religious divergencies that their original identity\r\nmight fail to be recognised, and they would take their places side\r\nby side as independent divinities in the national pantheon.\r\n\r\nThis duplication of deities, the result of the final fusion of\r\nkindred tribes who had long lived apart, would account for the\r\nappearance of Janus beside Jupiter, and of Diana or Jana beside Juno\r\nin the Roman religion. At least this appears to be a more probable\r\ntheory than the opinion, which has found favour with some modern\r\nscholars, that Janus was originally nothing but the god of doors.\r\nThat a deity of his dignity and importance, whom the Romans revered\r\nas a god of gods and the father of his people, should have started\r\nin life as a humble, though doubtless respectable, doorkeeper\r\nappears very unlikely. So lofty an end hardly consorts with so lowly\r\na beginning. It is more probable that the door (_janua_) got its\r\nname from Janus than that he got his name from it. This view is\r\nstrengthened by a consideration of the word _janua_ itself. The\r\nregular word for door is the same in all the languages of the Aryan\r\nfamily from India to Ireland. It is _dur_ in Sanscrit, _thura_ in\r\nGreek, _t\xfcr_ in German, _door_ in English, _dorus_ in old Irish, and\r\n_foris_ in Latin. Yet besides this ordinary name for door, which the\r\nLatins shared with all their Aryan brethren, they had also the name\r\n_janua,_ to which there is no corresponding term in any\r\nIndo-European speech. The word has the appearance of being an\r\nadjectival form derived from the noun _Janus._ I conjecture that it\r\nmay have been customary to set up an image or symbol of Janus at the\r\nprincipal door of the house in order to place the entrance under the\r\nprotection of the great god. A door thus guarded might be known as a\r\n_janua foris,_ that is, a Januan door, and the phrase might in time\r\nbe abridged into _janua,_ the noun _foris_ being understood but not\r\nexpressed. From this to the use of _janua_ to designate a door in\r\ngeneral, whether guarded by an image of Janus or not, would be an\r\neasy and natural transition.\r\n\r\nIf there is any truth in this conjecture, it may explain very simply\r\nthe origin of the double head of Janus, which has so long exercised\r\nthe ingenuity of mythologists. When it had become customary to guard\r\nthe entrance of houses and towns by an image of Janus, it might well\r\nbe deemed necessary to make the sentinel god look both ways, before\r\nand behind, at the same time, in order that nothing should escape\r\nhis vigilant eye. For if the divine watchman always faced in one\r\ndirection, it is easy to imagine what mischief might have been\r\nwrought with impunity behind his back. This explanation of the\r\ndouble-headed Janus at Rome is confirmed by the double-headed idol\r\nwhich the Bush negroes in the interior of Surinam regularly set up\r\nas a guardian at the entrance of a village. The idol consists of a\r\nblock of wood with a human face rudely carved on each side; it\r\nstands under a gateway composed of two uprights and a cross-bar.\r\nBeside the idol generally lies a white rag intended to keep off the\r\ndevil; and sometimes there is also a stick which seems to represent\r\na bludgeon or weapon of some sort. Further, from the cross-bar hangs\r\na small log which serves the useful purpose of knocking on the head\r\nany evil spirit who might attempt to pass through the gateway.\r\nClearly this double-headed fetish at the gateway of the negro\r\nvillages in Surinam bears a close resemblance to the double-headed\r\nimages of Janus which, grasping a stick in one hand and a key in the\r\nother, stood sentinel at Roman gates and doorways; and we can hardly\r\ndoubt that in both cases the heads facing two ways are to be\r\nsimilarly explained as expressive of the vigilance of the guardian\r\ngod, who kept his eye on spiritual foes behind and before, and stood\r\nready to bludgeon them on the spot. We may, therefore, dispense with\r\nthe tedious and unsatisfactory explanations which, if we may trust\r\nOvid, the wily Janus himself fobbed off an anxious Roman enquirer.\r\n\r\nTo apply these conclusions to the priest of Nemi, we may suppose\r\nthat as the mate of Diana he represented originally Dianus or Janus\r\nrather than Jupiter, but that the difference between these deities\r\nwas of old merely superficial, going little deeper than the names,\r\nand leaving practically unaffected the essential functions of the\r\ngod as a power of the sky, the thunder, and the oak. It was fitting,\r\ntherefore, that his human representative at Nemi should dwell, as we\r\nhave seen reason to believe he did, in an oak grove. His title of\r\nKing of the Wood clearly indicates the sylvan character of the deity\r\nwhom he served; and since he could only be assailed by him who had\r\nplucked the bough of a certain tree in the grove, his own life might\r\nbe said to be bound up with that of the sacred tree. Thus he not\r\nonly served but embodied the great Aryan god of the oak; and as an\r\noak-god he would mate with the oak-goddess, whether she went by the\r\nname of Egeria or Diana. Their union, however consummated, would be\r\ndeemed essential to the fertility of the earth and the fecundity of\r\nman and beast. Further, as the oak-god was also a god of the sky,\r\nthe thunder, and the rain, so his human representative would be\r\nrequired, like many other divine kings, to cause the clouds to\r\ngather, the thunder to peal, and the rain to descend in due season,\r\nthat the fields and orchards might bear fruit and the pastures be\r\ncovered with luxuriant herbage. The reputed possessor of powers so\r\nexalted must have been a very important personage; and the remains\r\nof buildings and of votive offerings which have been found on the\r\nsite of the sanctuary combine with the testimony of classical\r\nwriters to prove that in later times it was one of the greatest and\r\nmost popular shrines in Italy. Even in the old days, when the\r\nchampaign country around was still parcelled out among the petty\r\ntribes who composed the Latin League, the sacred grove is known to\r\nhave been an object of their common reverence and care. And just as\r\nthe kings of Cambodia used to send offerings to the mystic kings of\r\nFire and Water far in the dim depths of the tropical forest, so, we\r\nmay well believe, from all sides of the broad Latian plain the eyes\r\nand footsteps of Italian pilgrims turned to the quarter where,\r\nstanding sharply out against the faint blue line of the Apennines or\r\nthe deeper blue of the distant sea, the Alban Mountain rose before\r\nthem, the home of the mysterious priest of Nemi, the King of the\r\nWood. There, among the green woods and beside the still waters of\r\nthe lonely hills, the ancient Aryan worship of the god of the oak,\r\nthe thunder, and the dripping sky lingered in its early, almost\r\nDruidical form, long after a great political and intellectual\r\nrevolution had shifted the capital of Latin religion from the forest\r\nto the city, from Nemi to Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII. The Burden of Royalty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Royal and Priestly Taboos\r\n\r\nAT A CERTAIN stage of early society the king or priest is often\r\nthought to be endowed with supernatural powers or to be an\r\nincarnation of a deity, and consistently with this belief the course\r\nof nature is supposed to be more or less under his control, and he\r\nis held responsible for bad weather, failure of the crops, and\r\nsimilar calamities. To some extent it appears to be assumed that the\r\nking\'s power over nature, like that over his subjects and slaves, is\r\nexerted through definite acts of will; and therefore if drought,\r\nfamine, pestilence, or storms arise, the people attribute the\r\nmisfortune to the negligence or guilt of their king, and punish him\r\naccordingly with stripes and bonds, or, if he remains obdurate, with\r\ndeposition and death. Sometimes, however, the course of nature,\r\nwhile regarded as dependent on the king, is supposed to be partly\r\nindependent of his will. His person is considered, if we may express\r\nit so, as the dynamical centre of the universe, from which lines of\r\nforce radiate to all quarters of the heaven; so that any motion of\r\nhis--the turning of his head, the lifting of his\r\nhand--instantaneously affects and may seriously disturb some part of\r\nnature. He is the point of support on which hangs the balance of the\r\nworld, and the slightest irregularity on his part may overthrow the\r\ndelicate equipoise. The greatest care must, therefore, be taken both\r\nby and of him; and his whole life, down to its minutest details,\r\nmust be so regulated that no act of his, voluntary or involuntary,\r\nmay disarrange or upset the established order of nature. Of this\r\nclass of monarchs the Mikado or Dairi, the spiritual emperor of\r\nJapan, is or rather used to be a typical example. He is an\r\nincarnation of the sun goddess, the deity who rules the universe,\r\ngods and men included; once a year all the gods wait upon him and\r\nspend a month at his court. During that month, the name of which\r\nmeans "without gods," no one frequents the temples, for they are\r\nbelieved to be deserted. The Mikado receives from his people and\r\nassumes in his official proclamations and decrees the title of\r\n"manifest or incarnate deity," and he claims a general authority\r\nover the gods of Japan. For example, in an official decree of the\r\nyear 646 the emperor is described as "the incarnate god who governs\r\nthe universe."\r\n\r\nThe following description of the Mikado\'s mode of life was written\r\nabout two hundred years ago:\r\n\r\n"Even to this day the princes descended of this family, more\r\nparticularly those who sit on the throne, are looked upon as persons\r\nmost holy in themselves, and as Popes by birth. And, in order to\r\npreserve these advantageous notions in the minds of their subjects,\r\nthey are obliged to take an uncommon care of their sacred persons,\r\nand to do such things, which, examined according to the customs of\r\nother nations, would be thought ridiculous and impertinent. It will\r\nnot be improper to give a few instances of it. He thinks that it\r\nwould be very prejudicial to his dignity and holiness to touch the\r\nground with his feet; for this reason, when he intends to go\r\nanywhere, he must be carried thither on men\'s shoulders. Much less\r\nwill they suffer that he should expose his sacred person to the open\r\nair, and the sun is not thought worthy to shine on his head. There\r\nis such a holiness ascribed to all the parts of his body that he\r\ndares to cut off neither his hair, nor his beard, nor his nails.\r\nHowever, lest he should grow too dirty, they may clean him in the\r\nnight when he is asleep; because, they say, that which is taken from\r\nhis body at that time, hath been stolen from him, and that such a\r\ntheft doth not prejudice his holiness or dignity. In ancient times,\r\nhe was obliged to sit on the throne for some hours every morning,\r\nwith the imperial crown on his head, but to sit altogether like a\r\nstatue, without stirring either hands or feet, head or eyes, nor\r\nindeed any part of his body, because, by this means, it was thought\r\nthat he could preserve peace and tranquillity in his empire; for if,\r\nunfortunately, he turned himself on one side or the other, or if he\r\nlooked a good while towards any part of his dominions, it was\r\napprehended that war, famine, fire, or some other great misfortune\r\nwas near at hand to desolate the country. But it having been\r\nafterwards discovered, that the imperial crown was the palladium,\r\nwhich by its immobility could preserve peace in the empire, it was\r\nthought expedient to deliver his imperial person, consecrated only\r\nto idleness and pleasures, from this burthensome duty, and therefore\r\nthe crown is at present placed on the throne for some hours every\r\nmorning. His victuals must be dressed every time in new pots, and\r\nserved at table in new dishes: both are very clean and neat, but\r\nmade only of common clay; that without any considerable expense they\r\nmay be laid aside, or broke, after they have served once. They are\r\ngenerally broke, for fear they should come into the hands of laymen,\r\nfor they believe religiously, that if any layman should presume to\r\neat his food out of these sacred dishes, it would swell and inflame\r\nhis mouth and throat. The like ill effect is dreaded from the\r\nDairi\'s sacred habits; for they believe that if a layman should wear\r\nthem, without the Emperor\'s express leave or command, they would\r\noccasion swellings and pains in all parts of his body." To the same\r\neffect an earlier account of the Mikado says: "It was considered as\r\na shameful degradation for him even to touch the ground with his\r\nfoot. The sun and moon were not even permitted to shine upon his\r\nhead. None of the superfluities of the body were ever taken from\r\nhim, neither his hair, his beard, nor his nails were cut. Whatever\r\nhe eat was dressed in new vessels."\r\n\r\nSimilar priestly or rather divine kings are found, at a lower level\r\nof barbarism, on the west coast of Africa. At Shark Point near Cape\r\nPadron, in Lower Guinea, lives the priestly king Kukulu, alone in a\r\nwood. He may not touch a woman nor leave his house; indeed he may\r\nnot even quit his chair, in which he is obliged to sleep sitting,\r\nfor if he lay down no wind would arise and navigation would be\r\nstopped. He regulates storms, and in general maintains a wholesome\r\nand equable state of the atmosphere. On Mount Agu in Togo there\r\nlives a fetish or spirit called Bagba, who is of great importance\r\nfor the whole of the surrounding country. The power of giving or\r\nwithholding rain is ascribed to him, and he is lord of the winds,\r\nincluding the Harmattan, the dry, hot wind which blows from the\r\ninterior. His priest dwells in a house on the highest peak of the\r\nmountain, where he keeps the winds bottled up in huge jars.\r\nApplications for rain, too, are made to him, and he does a good\r\nbusiness in amulets, which consist of the teeth and claws of\r\nleopards. Yet though his power is great and he is indeed the real\r\nchief of the land, the rule of the fetish forbids him ever to leave\r\nthe mountain, and he must spend the whole of his life on its summit.\r\nOnly once a year may he come down to make purchases in the market;\r\nbut even then he may not set foot in the hut of any mortal man, and\r\nmust return to his place of exile the same day. The business of\r\ngovernment in the villages is conducted by subordinate chiefs, who\r\nare appointed by him. In the West African kingdom of Congo there was\r\na supreme pontiff called Chitom\xe9 or Chitomb\xe9, whom the negroes\r\nregarded as a god on earth and all-powerful in heaven. Hence before\r\nthey would taste the new crops they offered him the first-fruits,\r\nfearing that manifold misfortunes would befall them if they broke\r\nthis rule. When he left his residence to visit other places within\r\nhis jurisdiction, all married people had to observe strict\r\ncontinence the whole time he was out; for it was supposed that any\r\nact of incontinence would prove fatal to him. And if he were to die\r\na natural death, they thought that the world would perish, and the\r\nearth, which he alone sustained by his power and merit, would\r\nimmediately be annihilated. Amongst the semi-barbarous nations of\r\nthe New World, at the date of the Spanish conquest, there were found\r\nhierarchies or theocracies like those of Japan; in particular, the\r\nhigh pontiff of the Zapotecs appears to have presented a close\r\nparallel to the Mikado. A powerful rival to the king himself, this\r\nspiritual lord governed Yopaa, one of the chief cities of the\r\nkingdom, with absolute dominion. It is impossible, we are told, to\r\noverrate the reverence in which he was held. He was looked on as a\r\ngod whom the earth was not worthy to hold nor the sun to shine upon.\r\nHe profaned his sanctity if he even touched the ground with his\r\nfoot. The officers who bore his palanquin on their shoulders were\r\nmembers of the highest families: he hardly deigned to look on\r\nanything around him; and all who met him fell with their faces to\r\nthe earth, fearing that death would overtake them if they saw even\r\nhis shadow. A rule of continence was regularly imposed on the\r\nZapotec priests, especially upon the high pontiff; but "on certain\r\ndays in each year, which were generally celebrated with feasts and\r\ndances, it was customary for the high priest to become drunk. While\r\nin this state, seeming to belong neither to heaven nor to earth, one\r\nof the most beautiful of the virgins consecrated to the service of\r\nthe gods was brought to him." If the child she bore him was a son,\r\nhe was brought up as a prince of the blood, and the eldest son\r\nsucceeded his father on the pontifical throne. The supernatural\r\npowers attributed to this pontiff are not specified, but probably\r\nthey resembled those of the Mikado and Chitom\xe9.\r\n\r\nWherever, as in Japan and West Africa, it is supposed that the order\r\nof nature, and even the existence of the world, is bound up with the\r\nlife of the king or priest, it is clear that he must be regarded by\r\nhis subjects as a source both of infinite blessing and of infinite\r\ndanger. On the one hand, the people have to thank him for the rain\r\nand sunshine which foster the fruits of the earth, for the wind\r\nwhich brings ships to their coasts, and even for the solid ground\r\nbeneath their feet. But what he gives he can refuse; and so close is\r\nthe dependence of nature on his person, so delicate the balance of\r\nthe system of forces whereof he is the centre, that the least\r\nirregularity on his part may set up a tremor which shall shake the\r\nearth to its foundations. And if nature may be disturbed by the\r\nslightest involuntary act of the king, it is easy to conceive the\r\nconvulsion which his death might provoke. The natural death of the\r\nChitom\xe9, as we have seen, was thought to entail the destruction of\r\nall things. Clearly, therefore, out of a regard for their own\r\nsafety, which might be imperilled by any rash act of the king, and\r\nstill more by his death, the people will exact of their king or\r\npriest a strict conformity to those rules, the observance of which\r\nis deemed necessary for his own preservation, and consequently for\r\nthe preservation of his people and the world. The idea that early\r\nkingdoms are despotisms in which the people exist only for the\r\nsovereign, is wholly inapplicable to the monarchies we are\r\nconsidering. On the contrary, the sovereign in them exists only for\r\nhis subjects; his life is only valuable so long as he discharges the\r\nduties of his position by ordering the course of nature for his\r\npeople\'s benefit. So soon as he fails to do so, the care, the\r\ndevotion, the religious homage which they had hitherto lavished on\r\nhim cease and are changed into hatred and contempt; he is dismissed\r\nignominiously, and may be thankful if he escapes with his life.\r\nWorshipped as a god one day, he is killed as a criminal the next.\r\nBut in this changed behaviour of the people there is nothing\r\ncapricious or inconsistent. On the contrary, their conduct is\r\nentirely of a piece. If their king is their god, he is or should be\r\nalso their preserver; and if he will not preserve them, he must make\r\nroom for another who will. So long, however, as he answers their\r\nexpectations, there is no limit to the care which they take of him,\r\nand which they compel him to take of himself. A king of this sort\r\nlives hedged in by a ceremonious etiquette, a network of\r\nprohibitions and observances, of which the intention is not to\r\ncontribute to his dignity, much less to his comfort, but to restrain\r\nhim from conduct which, by disturbing the harmony of nature, might\r\ninvolve himself, his people, and the universe in one common\r\ncatastrophe. Far from adding to his comfort, these observances, by\r\ntrammelling his every act, annihilate his freedom and often render\r\nthe very life, which it is their object to preserve, a burden and\r\nsorrow to him.\r\n\r\nOf the supernaturally endowed kings of Loango it is said that the\r\nmore powerful a king is, the more taboos is he bound to observe;\r\nthey regulate all his actions, his walking and his standing, his\r\neating and drinking, his sleeping and waking. To these restraints\r\nthe heir to the throne is subject from infancy; but as he advances\r\nin life the number of abstinences and ceremonies which he must\r\nobserve increases, "until at the moment that he ascends the throne\r\nhe is lost in the ocean of rites and taboos." In the crater of an\r\nextinct volcano, enclosed on all sides by grassy slopes, lie the\r\nscattered huts and yam-fields of Riabba, the capital of the native\r\nking of Fernando Po. This mysterious being lives in the lowest\r\ndepths of the crater, surrounded by a harem of forty women, and\r\ncovered, it is said, with old silver coins. Naked savage as he is,\r\nhe yet exercises far more influence in the island than the Spanish\r\ngovernor at Santa Isabel. In him the conservative spirit of the\r\nBoobies or aboriginal inhabitants of the island is, as it were,\r\nincorporate. He has never seen a white man and, according to the\r\nfirm conviction of all the Boobies, the sight of a pale face would\r\ncause his instant death. He cannot bear to look upon the sea; indeed\r\nit is said that he may never see it even in the distance, and that\r\ntherefore he wears away his life with shackles on his legs in the\r\ndim twilight of his hut. Certain it is that he has never set foot on\r\nthe beach. With the exception of his musket and knife, he uses\r\nnothing that comes from the whites; European cloth never touches his\r\nperson, and he scorns tobacco, rum, and even salt.\r\n\r\nAmong the Ewe-speaking peoples of the Slave Coast "the king is at\r\nthe same time high priest. In this quality he was, particularly in\r\nformer times, unapproachable by his subjects. Only by night was he\r\nallowed to quit his dwelling in order to bathe and so forth. None\r\nbut his representative, the so-called \'visible king,\' with three\r\nchosen elders might converse with him, and even they had to sit on\r\nan ox-hide with their backs turned to him. He might not see any\r\nEuropean nor any horse, nor might he look upon the sea, for which\r\nreason he was not allowed to quit his capital even for a few\r\nmoments. These rules have been disregarded in recent times." The\r\nking of Dahomey himself is subject to the prohibition of beholding\r\nthe sea, and so are the kings of Loango and Great Ardra in Guinea.\r\nThe sea is the fetish of the Eyeos, to the north-west of Dahomey,\r\nand they and their king are threatened with death by their priests\r\nif ever they dare to look on it. It is believed that the king of\r\nCayor in Senegal would infallibly die within the year if he were to\r\ncross a river or an arm of the sea. In Mashonaland down to recent\r\ntimes the chiefs would not cross certain rivers, particularly the\r\nRurikwi and the Nyadiri; and the custom was still strictly observed\r\nby at least one chief within recent years. "On no account will the\r\nchief cross the river. If it is absolutely necessary for him to do\r\nso, he is blindfolded and carried across with shouting and singing.\r\nShould he walk across, he will go blind or die and certainly lose\r\nthe chieftainship." So among the Mahafalys and Sakalavas in the\r\nsouth of Madagascar some kings are forbidden to sail on the sea or\r\nto cross certain rivers. Among the Sakalavas the chief is regarded\r\nas a sacred being, but "he is held in leash by a crowd of\r\nrestrictions, which regulate his behaviour like that of the emperor\r\nof China. He can undertake nothing whatever unless the sorcerers\r\nhave declared the omens favourable; he may not eat warm food: on\r\ncertain days he may not quit his hut; and so on." Among some of the\r\nhill tribes of Assam both the headman and his wife have to observe\r\nmany taboos in respect of food; thus they may not eat buffalo, pork,\r\ndog, fowl, or tomatoes. The headman must be chaste, the husband of\r\none wife, and he must separate himself from her on the eve of a\r\ngeneral or public observance of taboo. In one group of tribes the\r\nheadman is forbidden to eat in a strange village, and under no\r\nprovocation whatever may he utter a word of abuse. Apparently the\r\npeople imagine that the violation of any of these taboos by a\r\nheadman would bring down misfortune on the whole village.\r\n\r\nThe ancient kings of Ireland, as well as the kings of the four\r\nprovinces of Leinster, Munster, Connaught, and Ulster, were subject\r\nto certain quaint prohibitions or taboos, on the due observance of\r\nwhich the prosperity of the people of the country, as well as their\r\nown, was supposed to depend. Thus, for example, the sun might not\r\nrise on the king of Ireland in his bed at Tara, the old capital of\r\nErin; he was forbidden to alight on Wednesday at Magh Breagh, to\r\ntraverse Magh Cuillinn after sunset, to incite his horse at\r\nFan-Chomair, to go in a ship upon the water the Monday after\r\nBealltaine (May day), and to leave the track of his army upon Ath\r\nMaighne the Tuesday after All-Hallows. The king of Leinster might\r\nnot go round Tuath Laighean left-hand-wise on Wednesday, nor sleep\r\nbetween the Dothair (Dodder) and the Duibhlinn with his head\r\ninclining to one side, nor encamp for nine days on the plains of\r\nCualann, nor travel the road of Duibhlinn on Monday, nor ride a\r\ndirty black-heeled horse across Magh Maistean. The king of Munster\r\nwas prohibited from enjoying the feast of Loch Lein from one Monday\r\nto another; from banqueting by night in the beginning of harvest\r\nbefore Geim at Leitreacha; from encamping for nine days upon the\r\nSiuir; and from holding a border meeting at Gabhran. The king of\r\nConnaught might not conclude a treaty respecting his ancient palace\r\nof Cruachan after making peace on All-Hallows Day, nor go in a\r\nspeckled garment on a grey speckled steed to the heath of Dal Chais,\r\nnor repair to an assembly of women at Seaghais, nor sit in autumn on\r\nthe sepulchral mounds of the wife of Maine, nor contend in running\r\nwith the rider of a grey one-eyed horse at Ath Gallta between two\r\nposts. The king of Ulster was forbidden to attend the horse fair at\r\nRath Line among the youths of Dal Araidhe, to listen to the\r\nfluttering of the flocks of birds of Linn Saileach after sunset, to\r\ncelebrate the feast of the bull of Daire-mic-Daire, to go into Magh\r\nCobha in the month of March, and to drink of the water of Bo\r\nNeimhidh between two darknesses. If the kings of Ireland strictly\r\nobserved these and many other customs, which were enjoined by\r\nimmemorial usage, it was believed that they would never meet with\r\nmischance or misfortune, and would live for ninety years without\r\nexperiencing the decay of old age; that no epidemic or mortality\r\nwould occur during their reigns; and that the seasons would be\r\nfavourable and the earth yield its fruit in abundance; whereas, if\r\nthey set the ancient usages at naught, the country would be visited\r\nwith plague, famine, and bad weather.\r\n\r\nThe kings of Egypt were worshipped as gods, and the routine of their\r\ndaily life was regulated in every detail by precise and unvarying\r\nrules. "The life of the kings of Egypt," says Diodorus, "was not\r\nlike that of other monarchs who are irresponsible and may do just\r\nwhat they choose; on the contrary, everything was fixed for them by\r\nlaw, not only their official duties, but even the details of their\r\ndaily life. . . . The hours both of day and night were arranged at\r\nwhich the king had to do, not what he pleased, but what was\r\nprescribed for him. . . . For not only were the times appointed at\r\nwhich he should transact public business or sit in judgment; but the\r\nvery hours for his walking and bathing and sleeping with his wife,\r\nand, in short, performing every act of life were all settled. Custom\r\nenjoined a simple diet; the only flesh he might eat was veal and\r\ngoose, and he might only drink a prescribed quantity of wine."\r\nHowever, there is reason to think that these rules were observed,\r\nnot by the ancient Pharaohs, but by the priestly kings who reigned\r\nat Thebes and Ethiopia at the close of the twentieth dynasty.\r\n\r\nOf the taboos imposed on priests we may see a striking example in\r\nthe rules of life prescribed for the Flamen Dialis at Rome, who has\r\nbeen interpreted as a living image of Jupiter, or a human embodiment\r\nof the sky-spirit. They were such as the following: The Flamen\r\nDialis might not ride or even touch a horse, nor see an army under\r\narms, nor wear a ring which was not broken, nor have a knot on any\r\npart of his garments; no fire except a sacred fire might be taken\r\nout of his house; he might not touch wheaten flour or leavened\r\nbread; he might not touch or even name a goat, a dog, raw meat,\r\nbeans, and ivy; he might not walk under a vine; the feet of his bed\r\nhad to be daubed with mud; his hair could be cut only by a free man\r\nand with a bronze knife and his hair and nails when cut had to be\r\nburied under a lucky tree; he might not touch a dead body nor enter\r\na place where one was burned; he might not see work being done on\r\nholy days; he might not be uncovered in the open air; if a man in\r\nbonds were taken into his house, the captive had to be unbound and\r\nthe cords had to be drawn up through a hole in the roof and so let\r\ndown into the street. His wife, the Flaminica, had to observe nearly\r\nthe same rules, and others of her own besides. She might not ascend\r\nmore than three steps of the kind of staircase called Greek; at a\r\ncertain festival she might not comb her hair; the leather of her\r\nshoes might not be made from a beast that had died a natural death,\r\nbut only from one that had been slain or sacrificed; if she heard\r\nthunder she was tabooed till she had offered an expiatory sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAmong the Grebo people of Sierra Leone there is a pontiff who bears\r\nthe title of Bodia and has been compared, on somewhat slender\r\ngrounds, to the high priest of the Jews. He is appointed in\r\naccordance with the behest of an oracle. At an elaborate ceremony of\r\ninstallation he is anointed, a ring is put on his ankle as a badge\r\nof office, and the door-posts of his house are sprinkled with the\r\nblood of a sacrificed goat. He has charge of the public talismans\r\nand idols, which he feeds with rice and oil every new moon; and he\r\nsacrifices on behalf of the town to the dead and to demons.\r\nNominally his power is very great, but in practice it is very\r\nlimited; for he dare not defy public opinion, and he is held\r\nresponsible, even with his life, for any adversity that befalls the\r\ncountry. It is expected of him that he should cause the earth to\r\nbring forth abundantly, the people to be healthy, war to be driven\r\nfar away, and witchcraft to be kept in abeyance. His life is\r\ntrammelled by the observance of certain restrictions or taboos. Thus\r\nhe may not sleep in any house but his own official residence, which\r\nis called the "anointed house" with reference to the ceremony of\r\nanointing him at inauguration. He may not drink water on the\r\nhighway. He may not eat while a corpse is in the town, and he may\r\nnot mourn for the dead. If he dies while in office, he must be\r\nburied at dead of night; few may hear of his burial, and none may\r\nmourn for him when his death is made public. Should he have fallen a\r\nvictim to the poison ordeal by drinking a decoction of sassywood, as\r\nit is called, he must be buried under a running stream of water.\r\n\r\nAmong the Todas of Southern India the holy milkman, who acts as\r\npriest of the sacred dairy, is subject to a variety of irksome and\r\nburdensome restrictions during the whole time of his incumbency,\r\nwhich may last many years. Thus he must live at the sacred dairy and\r\nmay never visit his home or any ordinary village. He must be\r\ncelibate; if he is married he must leave his wife. On no account may\r\nany ordinary person touch the holy milkman or the holy dairy; such a\r\ntouch would so defile his holiness that he would forfeit his office.\r\nIt is only on two days a week, namely Mondays and Thursdays, that a\r\nmere layman may even approach the milkman; on other days if he has\r\nany business with him, he must stand at a distance (some say a\r\nquarter of a mile) and shout his message across the intervening\r\nspace. Further, the holy milkman never cuts his hair or pares his\r\nnails so long as he holds office; he never crosses a river by a\r\nbridge, but wades through a ford and only certain fords; if a death\r\noccurs in his clan, he may not attend any of the funeral ceremonies,\r\nunless he first resigns his office and descends from the exalted\r\nrank of milkman to that of a mere common mortal. Indeed it appears\r\nthat in old days he had to resign the seals, or rather the pails, of\r\noffice whenever any member of his clan departed this life. However,\r\nthese heavy restraints are laid in their entirety only on milkmen of\r\nthe very highest class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Divorce of the Spiritual from the Temporal Power\r\n\r\nTHE BURDENSOME observances attached to the royal or priestly office\r\nproduced their natural effect. Either men refused to accept the\r\noffice, which hence tended to fall into abeyance; or accepting it,\r\nthey sank under its weight into spiritless creatures, cloistered\r\nrecluses, from whose nerveless fingers the reins of government\r\nslipped into the firmer grasp of men who were often content to wield\r\nthe reality of sovereignty without its name. In some countries this\r\nrift in the supreme power deepened into a total and permanent\r\nseparation of the spiritual and temporal powers, the old royal house\r\nretaining their purely religious functions, while the civil\r\ngovernment passed into the hands of a younger and more vigorous\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nTo take examples. In a previous part of this work we saw that in\r\nCambodia it is often necessary to force the kingships of Fire and\r\nWater upon the reluctant successors, and that in Savage Island the\r\nmonarchy actually came to an end because at last no one could be\r\ninduced to accept the dangerous distinction. In some parts of West\r\nAfrica, when the king dies, a family council is secretly held to\r\ndetermine his successor. He on whom the choice falls is suddenly\r\nseized, bound, and thrown into the fetish-house, where he is kept in\r\ndurance till he consents to accept the crown. Sometimes the heir\r\nfinds means of evading the honour which it is sought to thrust upon\r\nhim; a ferocious chief has been known to go about constantly armed,\r\nresolute to resist by force any attempt to set him on the throne.\r\nThe savage Timmes of Sierra Leone, who elect their king, reserve to\r\nthemselves the right of beating him on the eve of his coronation;\r\nand they avail themselves of this constitutional privilege with such\r\nhearty goodwill that sometimes the unhappy monarch does not long\r\nsurvive his elevation to the throne. Hence when the leading chiefs\r\nhave a spite at a man and wish to rid themselves of him, they elect\r\nhim king. Formerly, before a man was proclaimed king of Sierra\r\nLeone, it used to be the custom to load him with chains and thrash\r\nhim. Then the fetters were knocked off, the kingly robe was placed\r\non him, and he received in his hands the symbol of royal dignity,\r\nwhich was nothing but the axe of the executioner. It is not\r\ntherefore surprising to read that in Sierra Leone, where such\r\ncustoms have prevailed, "except among the Mandingoes and Suzees, few\r\nkings are natives of the countries they govern. So different are\r\ntheir ideas from ours, that very few are solicitous of the honour,\r\nand competition is very seldom heard of."\r\n\r\nThe Mikados of Japan seem early to have resorted to the expedient of\r\ntransferring the honours and burdens of supreme power to their\r\ninfant children; and the rise of the Tycoons, long the temporal\r\nsovereigns of the country, is traced to the abdication of a certain\r\nMikado in favour of his three-year-old son. The sovereignty having\r\nbeen wrested by a usurper from the infant prince, the cause of the\r\nMikado was championed by Yoritomo, a man of spirit and conduct, who\r\noverthrew the usurper and restored to the Mikado the shadow, while\r\nhe retained for himself the substance, of power. He bequeathed to\r\nhis descendants the dignity he had won, and thus became the founder\r\nof the line of Tycoons. Down to the latter half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury the Tycoons were active and efficient rulers; but the same\r\nfate overtook them which had befallen the Mikados. Immeshed in the\r\nsame inextricable web of custom and law, they degenerated into mere\r\npuppets, hardly stirring from their palaces and occupied in a\r\nperpetual round of empty ceremonies, while the real business of\r\ngovernment was managed by the council of state. In Tonquin the\r\nmonarchy ran a similar course. Living like his predecessors in\r\neffeminacy and sloth, the king was driven from the throne by an\r\nambitious adventurer named Mack, who from a fisherman had risen to\r\nbe Grand Mandarin. But the king\'s brother Tring put down the usurper\r\nand restored the king, retaining, however, for himself and his\r\ndescendants the dignity of general of all the forces. Thenceforward\r\nthe kings, though invested with the title and pomp of sovereignty,\r\nceased to govern. While they lived secluded in their palaces, all\r\nreal political power was wielded by the hereditary generals.\r\n\r\nIn Mangaia, a Polynesian island, religious and civil authority were\r\nlodged in separate hands, spiritual functions being discharged by a\r\nline of hereditary kings, while the temporal government was\r\nentrusted from time to time to a victorious war-chief, whose\r\ninvestiture, however, had to be completed by the king. Similarly in\r\nTonga, besides the civil king whose right to the throne was partly\r\nhereditary and partly derived from his warlike reputation and the\r\nnumber of his fighting men, there was a great divine chief who\r\nranked above the king and the other chiefs in virtue of his supposed\r\ndescent from one of the chief gods. Once a year the first-fruits of\r\nthe ground were offered to him at a solemn ceremony, and it was\r\nbelieved that if these offerings were not made the vengeance of the\r\ngods would fall in a signal manner on the people. Peculiar forms of\r\nspeech, such as were applied to no one else, were used in speaking\r\nof him, and everything that he chanced to touch became sacred or\r\ntabooed. When he and the king met, the monarch had to sit down on\r\nthe ground in token of respect until his holiness had passed by. Yet\r\nthough he enjoyed the highest veneration by reason of his divine\r\norigin, this sacred personage possessed no political authority, and\r\nif he ventured to meddle with affairs of state it was at the risk of\r\nreceiving a rebuff from the king, to whom the real power belonged,\r\nand who finally succeeded in ridding himself of his spiritual rival.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Western Africa two kings reign side by side, a\r\nfetish or religious king and a civil king, but the fetish king is\r\nreally supreme. He controls the weather and so forth, and can put a\r\nstop to everything. When he lays his red staff on the ground, no one\r\nmay pass that way. This division of power between a sacred and a\r\nsecular ruler is to be met with wherever the true negro culture has\r\nbeen left unmolested, but where the negro form of society has been\r\ndisturbed, as in Dahomey and Ashantee, there is a tendency to\r\nconsolidate the two powers in a single king.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the East Indian island of Timor we meet with a\r\npartition of power like that which is represented by the civil king\r\nand the fetish king of Western Africa. Some of the Timorese tribes\r\nrecognise two rajahs, the ordinary or civil rajah, who governs the\r\npeople, and the fetish or taboo rajah, who is charged with the\r\ncontrol of everything that concerns the earth and its products. This\r\nlatter ruler has the right of declaring anything taboo; his\r\npermission must be obtained before new land may be brought under\r\ncultivation, and he must perform certain necessary ceremonies when\r\nthe work is being carried out. If drought or blight threatens the\r\ncrops, his help is invoked to save them. Though he ranks below the\r\ncivil rajah, he exercises a momentous influence on the course of\r\nevents, for his secular colleague is bound to consult him in all\r\nimportant matters. In some of the neighbouring islands, such as\r\nRotti and eastern Flores, a spiritual ruler of the same sort is\r\nrecognised under various native names, which all mean "lord of the\r\nground." Similarly in the Mekeo district of British New Guinea there\r\nis a double chieftainship. The people are divided into two groups\r\naccording to families, and each of the groups has its chief. One of\r\nthe two is the war chief, the other is the taboo chief. The office\r\nof the latter is hereditary; his duty is to impose a taboo on any of\r\nthe crops, such as the coco-nuts and areca nuts, whenever he thinks\r\nit desirable to prohibit their use. In his office we may perhaps\r\ndetect the beginning of a priestly dynasty, but as yet his functions\r\nappear to be more magical than religious, being concerned with the\r\ncontrol of the harvests rather than with the propitiation of higher\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII. The Perils of the Soul\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Soul as a Mannikin\r\n\r\nTHE FOREGOING examples have taught us that the office of a sacred\r\nking or priest is often hedged in by a series of burdensome\r\nrestrictions or taboos, of which a principal purpose appears to be\r\nto preserve the life of the divine man for the good of his people.\r\nBut if the object of the taboos is to save his life, the question\r\narises, How is their observance supposed to effect this end? To\r\nunderstand this we must know the nature of the danger which\r\nthreatens the king\'s life, and which it is the intention of these\r\ncurious restrictions to guard against. We must, therefore, ask: What\r\ndoes early man understand by death? To what causes does he attribute\r\nit? And how does he think it may be guarded against?\r\n\r\nAs the savage commonly explains the processes of inanimate nature by\r\nsupposing that they are produced by living beings working in or\r\nbehind the phenomena, so he explains the phenomena of life itself.\r\nIf an animal lives and moves, it can only be, he thinks, because\r\nthere is a little animal inside which moves it: if a man lives and\r\nmoves, it can only be because he has a little man or animal inside\r\nwho moves him. The animal inside the animal, the man inside the man,\r\nis the soul. And as the activity of an animal or man is explained by\r\nthe presence of the soul, so the repose of sleep or death is\r\nexplained by its absence; sleep or trance being the temporary, death\r\nbeing the permanent absence of the soul. Hence if death be the\r\npermanent absence of the soul, the way to guard against it is either\r\nto prevent the soul from leaving the body, or, if it does depart, to\r\nensure that it shall return. The precautions adopted by savages to\r\nsecure one or other of these ends take the form of certain\r\nprohibitions or taboos, which are nothing but rules intended to\r\nensure either the continued presence or the return of the soul. In\r\nshort, they are life-preservers or life-guards. These general\r\nstatements will now be illustrated by examples.\r\n\r\nAddressing some Australian blacks, a European missionary said, "I am\r\nnot one, as you think, but two." Upon this they laughed. "You may\r\nlaugh as much as you like," continued the missionary, "I tell you\r\nthat I am two in one; this great body that you see is one; within\r\nthat there is another little one which is not visible. The great\r\nbody dies, and is buried, but the little body flies away when the\r\ngreat one dies." To this some of the blacks replied, "Yes, yes. We\r\nalso are two, we also have a little body within the breast." On\r\nbeing asked where the little body went after death, some said it\r\nwent behind the bush, others said it went into the sea, and some\r\nsaid they did not know. The Hurons thought that the soul had a head\r\nand body, arms and legs; in short, that it was a complete little\r\nmodel of the man himself. The Esquimaux believe that "the soul\r\nexhibits the same shape as the body it belongs to, but is of a more\r\nsubtle and ethereal nature." According to the Nootkas the soul has\r\nthe shape of a tiny man; its seat is the crown of the head. So long\r\nas it stands erect, its owner is hale and hearty; but when from any\r\ncause it loses its upright position, he loses his senses. Among the\r\nIndian tribes of the Lower Fraser River, man is held to have four\r\nsouls, of which the principal one has the form of a mannikin, while\r\nthe other three are shadows of it. The Malays conceive the human\r\nsoul as a little man, mostly invisible and of the bigness of a\r\nthumb, who corresponds exactly in shape, proportion, and even in\r\ncomplexion to the man in whose body he resides. This mannikin is of\r\na thin, unsubstantial nature, though not so impalpable but that it\r\nmay cause displacement on entering a physical object, and it can\r\nflit quickly from place to place; it is temporarily absent from the\r\nbody in sleep, trance, and disease, and permanently absent after\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nSo exact is the resemblance of the mannikin to the man, in other\r\nwords, of the soul to the body, that, as there are fat bodies and\r\nthin bodies, so there are fat souls and thin souls; as there are\r\nheavy bodies and light bodies, long bodies and short bodies, so\r\nthere are heavy souls and light souls, long souls and short souls.\r\nThe people of Nias think that every man, before he is born, is asked\r\nhow long or how heavy a soul he would like, and a soul of the\r\ndesired weight or length is measured out to him. The heaviest soul\r\never given out weighs about ten grammes. The length of a man\'s life\r\nis proportioned to the length of his soul; children who die young\r\nhad short souls. The Fijian conception of the soul as a tiny human\r\nbeing comes clearly out in the customs observed at the death of a\r\nchief among the Nakelo tribe. When a chief dies, certain men, who\r\nare the hereditary undertakers, call him, as he lies, oiled and\r\nornamented, on fine mats, saying, "Rise, sir, the chief, and let us\r\nbe going. The day has come over the land." Then they conduct him to\r\nthe river side, where the ghostly ferryman comes to ferry Nakelo\r\nghosts across the stream. As they thus attend the chief on his last\r\njourney, they hold their great fans close to the ground to shelter\r\nhim, because, as one of them explained to a missionary, "His soul is\r\nonly a little child." People in the Punjaub who tattoo themselves\r\nbelieve that at death the soul, "the little entire man or woman"\r\ninside the mortal frame, will go to heaven blazoned with the same\r\ntattoo patterns which adorned the body in life. Sometimes, however,\r\nas we shall see, the human soul is conceived not in human but in\r\nanimal form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Absence and Recall of the Soul\r\n\r\nTHE SOUL is commonly supposed to escape by the natural openings of\r\nthe body, especially the mouth and nostrils. Hence in Celebes they\r\nsometimes fasten fish-hooks to a sick man\'s nose, navel, and feet,\r\nso that if his soul should try to escape it may be hooked and held\r\nfast. A Turik on the Baram River, in Borneo, refused to part with\r\nsome hook-like stones, because they, as it were, hooked his soul to\r\nhis body, and so prevented the spiritual portion of him from\r\nbecoming detached from the material. When a Sea Dyak sorcerer or\r\nmedicine-man is initiated, his fingers are supposed to be furnished\r\nwith fish-hooks, with which he will thereafter clutch the human soul\r\nin the act of flying away, and restore it to the body of the\r\nsufferer. But hooks, it is plain, may be used to catch the souls of\r\nenemies as well as of friends. Acting on this principle head-hunters\r\nin Borneo hang wooden hooks beside the skulls of their slain enemies\r\nin the belief that this helps them on their forays to hook in fresh\r\nheads. One of the implements of a Haida medicine-man is a hollow\r\nbone, in which he bottles up departing souls, and so restores them\r\nto their owners. When any one yawns in their presence the Hindoos\r\nalways snap their thumbs, believing that this will hinder the soul\r\nfrom issuing through the open mouth. The Marquesans used to hold the\r\nmouth and nose of a dying man, in order to keep him in life by\r\npreventing his soul from escaping; the same custom is reported of\r\nthe New Caledonians; and with the like intention the Bagobos of the\r\nPhilippine Islands put rings of brass wire on the wrists or ankles\r\nof their sick. On the other hand, the Itonamas of South America seal\r\nup the eyes, nose, and mouth of a dying person, in case his ghost\r\nshould get out and carry off others; and for a similar reason the\r\npeople of Nias, who fear the spirits of the recently deceased and\r\nidentify them with the breath, seek to confine the vagrant soul in\r\nits earthly tabernacle by bunging up the nose or tying up the jaws\r\nof the corpse. Before leaving a corpse the Wakelbura of Australia\r\nused to place hot coals in its ears in order to keep the ghost in\r\nthe body, until they had got such a good start that he could not\r\novertake them. In Southern Celebes, to hinder the escape of a\r\nwoman\'s soul in childbed, the nurse ties a band as tightly as\r\npossible round the body of the expectant mother. The Minangkabauers\r\nof Sumatra observe a similar custom; a skein of thread or a string\r\nis sometimes fastened round the wrist or loins of a woman in\r\nchildbed, so that when her soul seeks to depart in her hour of\r\ntravail it may find the egress barred. And lest the soul of a babe\r\nshould escape and be lost as soon as it is born, the Alfoors of\r\nCelebes, when a birth is about to take place, are careful to close\r\nevery opening in the house, even the keyhole; and they stop up every\r\nchink and cranny in the walls. Also they tie up the mouths of all\r\nanimals inside and outside the house, for fear one of them might\r\nswallow the child\'s soul. For a similar reason all persons present\r\nin the house, even the mother herself, are obliged to keep their\r\nmouths shut the whole time the birth is taking place. When the\r\nquestion was put, Why they did not hold their noses also, lest the\r\nchild\'s soul should get into one of them? the answer was that breath\r\nbeing exhaled as well as inhaled through the nostrils, the soul\r\nwould be expelled before it could have time to settle down. Popular\r\nexpressions in the language of civilised peoples, such as to have\r\none\'s heart in one\'s mouth, or the soul on the lips or in the nose,\r\nshow how natural is the idea that the life or soul may escape by the\r\nmouth or nostrils.\r\n\r\nOften the soul is conceived as a bird ready to take flight. This\r\nconception has probably left traces in most languages, and it\r\nlingers as a metaphor in poetry. The Malays carry out the conception\r\nof the bird-soul in a number of odd ways. If the soul is a bird on\r\nthe wing, it may be attracted by rice, and so either prevented from\r\nflying away or lured back again from its perilous flight. Thus in\r\nJava when a child is placed on the ground for the first time (a\r\nmoment which uncultured people seem to regard as especially\r\ndangerous), it is put in a hen-coop and the mother makes a clucking\r\nsound, as if she were calling hens. And in Sintang, a district of\r\nBorneo, when a person, whether man, woman, or child, has fallen out\r\nof a house or off a tree, and has been brought home, his wife or\r\nother kinswoman goes as speedily as possible to the spot where the\r\naccident happened, and there strews rice, which has been coloured\r\nyellow, while she utters the words, "Cluck! cluck! soul! So-and-so\r\nis in his house again. Cluck! cluck! soul!" Then she gathers up the\r\nrice in a basket, carries it to the sufferer, and drops the grains\r\nfrom her hand on his head, saying again, "Cluck! cluck! soul!" Here\r\nthe intention clearly is to decoy back the loitering bird-soul and\r\nreplace it in the head of its owner.\r\n\r\nThe soul of a sleeper is supposed to wander away from his body and\r\nactually to visit the places, to see the persons, and to perform the\r\nacts of which he dreams. For example, when an Indian of Brazil or\r\nGuiana wakes up from a sound sleep, he is firmly convinced that his\r\nsoul has really been away hunting, fishing, felling trees, or\r\nwhatever else he has dreamed of doing, while all the time his body\r\nhas been lying motionless in his hammock. A whole Bororo village has\r\nbeen thrown into a panic and nearly deserted because somebody had\r\ndreamed that he saw enemies stealthily approaching it. A Macusi\r\nIndian in weak health, who dreamed that his employer had made him\r\nhaul the canoe up a series of difficult cataracts, bitterly\r\nreproached his master next morning for his want of consideration in\r\nthus making a poor invalid go out and toil during the night. The\r\nIndians of the Gran Chaco are often heard to relate the most\r\nincredible stories as things which they have themselves seen and\r\nheard; hence strangers who do not know them intimately say in their\r\nhaste that these Indians are liars. In point of fact the Indians are\r\nfirmly convinced of the truth of what they relate; for these\r\nwonderful adventures are simply their dreams, which they do not\r\ndistinguish from waking realities.\r\n\r\nNow the absence of the soul in sleep has its dangers, for if from\r\nany cause the soul should be permanently detained away from the\r\nbody, the person thus deprived of the vital principle must die.\r\nThere is a German belief that the soul escapes from a sleeper\'s\r\nmouth in the form of a white mouse or a little bird, and that to\r\nprevent the return of the bird or animal would be fatal to the\r\nsleeper. Hence in Transylvania they say that you should not let a\r\nchild sleep with its mouth open, or its soul will slip out in the\r\nshape of a mouse, and the child will never wake. Many causes may\r\ndetain the sleeper\'s soul. Thus, his soul may meet the soul of\r\nanother sleeper and the two souls may fight; if a Guinea negro\r\nwakens with sore bones in the morning, he thinks that his soul has\r\nbeen thrashed by another soul in sleep. Or it may meet the soul of a\r\nperson just deceased and be carried off by it; hence in the Aru\r\nIslands the inmates of a house will not sleep the night after a\r\ndeath has taken place in it, because the soul of the deceased is\r\nsupposed to be still in the house and they fear to meet it in a\r\ndream. Again, the soul of the sleeper may be prevented by an\r\naccident or by physical force from returning to his body. When a\r\nDyak dreams of falling into the water, he supposes that this\r\naccident has really befallen his spirit, and he sends for a wizard,\r\nwho fishes for the spirit with a hand-net in a basin of water till\r\nhe catches it and restores it to its owner. The Santals tell how a\r\nman fell asleep, and growing very thirsty, his soul, in the form of\r\na lizard, left his body and entered a pitcher of water to drink.\r\nJust then the owner of the pitcher happened to cover it; so the soul\r\ncould not return to the body and the man died. While his friends\r\nwere preparing to burn the body some one uncovered the pitcher to\r\nget water. The lizard thus escaped and returned to the body, which\r\nimmediately revived; so the man rose up and asked his friends why\r\nthey were weeping. They told him they thought he was dead and were\r\nabout to burn his body. He said he had been down a well to get\r\nwater, but had found it hard to get out and had just returned. So\r\nthey saw it all.\r\n\r\nIt is a common rule with primitive people not to waken a sleeper,\r\nbecause his soul is away and might not have time to get back; so if\r\nthe man wakened without his soul, he would fall sick. If it is\r\nabsolutely necessary to rouse a sleeper, it must be done very\r\ngradually, to allow the soul time to return. A Fijian in Matuku,\r\nsuddenly wakened from a nap by somebody treading on his foot, has\r\nbeen heard bawling after his soul and imploring it to return. He had\r\njust been dreaming that he was far away in Tonga, and great was his\r\nalarm on suddenly wakening to find his body in Matuku. Death stared\r\nhim in the face unless his soul could be induced to speed at once\r\nacross the sea and reanimate its deserted tenement. The man would\r\nprobably have died of fright if a missionary had not been at hand to\r\nallay his terror.\r\n\r\nStill more dangerous is it in the opinion of primitive man to move a\r\nsleeper or alter his appearance, for if this were done the soul on\r\nits return might not be able to find or recognise its body, and so\r\nthe person would die. The Minangkabauers deem it highly improper to\r\nblacken or dirty the face of a sleeper, lest the absent soul should\r\nshrink from re-entering a body thus disfigured. Patani Malays fancy\r\nthat if a person\'s face be painted while he sleeps, the soul which\r\nhas gone out of him will not recognise him, and he will sleep on\r\ntill his face is washed. In Bombay it is thought equivalent to\r\nmurder to change the aspect of a sleeper, as by painting his face in\r\nfantastic colours or giving moustaches to a sleeping woman. For when\r\nthe soul returns it will not know its own body, and the person will\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nBut in order that a man\'s soul should quit his body, it is not\r\nnecessary that he should be asleep. It may quit him in his waking\r\nhours, and then sickness, insanity, or death will be the result.\r\nThus a man of the Wurunjeri tribe in Australia lay at his last gasp\r\nbecause his spirit had departed from him. A medicine-man went in\r\npursuit and caught the spirit by the middle just as it was about to\r\nplunge into the sunset glow, which is the light cast by the souls of\r\nthe dead as they pass in and out of the under-world, where the sun\r\ngoes to rest. Having captured the vagrant spirit, the doctor brought\r\nit back under his opossum rug, laid himself down on the dying man,\r\nand put the soul back into him, so that after a time he revived. The\r\nKarens of Burma are perpetually anxious about their souls, lest\r\nthese should go roving from their bodies, leaving the owners to die.\r\nWhen a man has reason to fear that his soul is about to take this\r\nfatal step, a ceremony is performed to retain or recall it, in which\r\nthe whole family must take part. A meal is prepared consisting of a\r\ncock and hen, a special kind of rice, and a bunch of bananas. Then\r\nthe head of the family takes the bowl which is used to skim rice,\r\nand knocking with it thrice on the top of the houseladder says:\r\n"_Prrrroo!_ Come back, soul, do not tarry outside! If it rains, you\r\nwill be wet. If the sun shines, you will be hot. The gnats will\r\nsting you, the leeches will bite you, the tigers will devour you,\r\nthe thunder will crush you. _Prrrroo!_ Come back, soul! Here it will\r\nbe well with you. You shall want for nothing. Come and eat under\r\nshelter from the wind and the storm." After that the family partakes\r\nof the meal, and the ceremony ends with everybody tying their right\r\nwrist with a string which has been charmed by a sorcerer. Similarly\r\nthe Lolos of South-western China believe that the soul leaves the\r\nbody in chronic illness. In that case they read a sort of elaborate\r\nlitany, calling on the soul by name and beseeching it to return from\r\nthe hills, the vales, the rivers, the forests, the fields, or from\r\nwherever it may be straying. At the same time cups of water, wine,\r\nand rice are set at the door for the refreshment of the weary\r\nwandering spirit. When the ceremony is over, they tie a red cord\r\nround the arm of the sick man to tether the soul, and this cord is\r\nworn by him until it decays and drops off.\r\n\r\nSome of the Congo tribes believe that when a man is ill, his soul\r\nhas left his body and is wandering at large. The aid of the sorcerer\r\nis then called in to capture the vagrant spirit and restore it to\r\nthe invalid. Generally the physician declares that he has\r\nsuccessfully chased the soul into the branch of a tree. The whole\r\ntown thereupon turns out and accompanies the doctor to the tree,\r\nwhere the strongest men are deputed to break off the branch in which\r\nthe soul of the sick man is supposed to be lodged. This they do and\r\ncarry the branch back to the town, insinuating by their gestures\r\nthat the burden is heavy and hard to bear. When the branch has been\r\nbrought to the sick man\'s hut, he is placed in an upright position\r\nby its side, and the sorcerer performs the enchantments by which the\r\nsoul is believed to be restored to its owner.\r\n\r\nPining, sickness, great fright, and death are ascribed by the Bataks\r\nof Sumatra to the absence of the soul from the body. At first they\r\ntry to beckon the wanderer back, and to lure him, like a fowl, by\r\nstrewing rice. Then the following form of words is commonly\r\nrepeated: "Come back, O soul, whether thou art lingering in the\r\nwood, or on the hills, or in the dale. See, I call thee with a\r\n_toemba bras,_ with an egg of the fowl Rajah _moelija,_ with the\r\neleven healing leaves. Detain it not, let it come straight here,\r\ndetain it not, neither in the wood, nor on the hill, nor in the\r\ndale. That may not be. O come straight home!" Once when a popular\r\ntraveller was leaving a Kayan village, the mothers, fearing that\r\ntheir children\'s souls might follow him on his journey, brought him\r\nthe boards on which they carry their infants and begged him to pray\r\nthat the souls of the little ones would return to the familiar\r\nboards and not go away with him into the far country. To each board\r\nwas fastened a looped string for the purpose of tethering the\r\nvagrant spirits, and through the loop each baby was made to pass a\r\nchubby finger to make sure that its tiny soul would not wander away.\r\n\r\nIn an Indian story a king conveys his soul into the dead body of a\r\nBrahman, and a hunchback conveys his soul into the deserted body of\r\nthe king. The hunchback is now king and the king is a Brahman.\r\nHowever, the hunchback is induced to show his skill by transferring\r\nhis soul to the dead body of a parrot, and the king seizes the\r\nopportunity to regain possession of his own body. A tale of the same\r\ntype, with variations of detail, reappears among the Malays. A king\r\nhas incautiously transferred his soul to an ape, upon which the\r\nvizier adroitly inserts his own soul into the king\'s body and so\r\ntakes possession of the queen and the kingdom, while the true king\r\nlanguishes at court in the outward semblance of an ape. But one day\r\nthe false king, who played for high stakes, was watching a combat of\r\nrams, and it happened that the animal on which he had laid his money\r\nfell down dead. All efforts to restore animation proved unavailing\r\ntill the false king, with the instinct of a true sportsman,\r\ntransferred his own soul to the body of the deceased ram, and thus\r\nrenewed the fray. The real king in the body of the ape saw his\r\nchance, and with great presence of mind darted back into his own\r\nbody, which the vizier had rashly vacated. So he came to his own\r\nagain, and the usurper in the ram\'s body met with the fate he richly\r\ndeserved. Similarly the Greeks told how the soul of Hermotimus of\r\nClazomenae used to quit his body and roam far and wide, bringing\r\nback intelligence of what he had seen on his rambles to his friends\r\nat home; until one day, when his spirit was abroad, his enemies\r\ncontrived to seize his deserted body and committed it to the flames.\r\n\r\nThe departure of the soul is not always voluntary. It may be\r\nextracted from the body against its will by ghosts, demons, or\r\nsorcerers. Hence, when a funeral is passing the house, the Karens\r\ntie their children with a special kind of string to a particular\r\npart of the house, lest the souls of the children should leave their\r\nbodies and go into the corpse which is passing. The children are\r\nkept tied in this way until the corpse is out of sight. And after\r\nthe corpse has been laid in the grave, but before the earth has been\r\nshovelled in, the mourners and friends range themselves round the\r\ngrave, each with a bamboo split lengthwise in one hand and a little\r\nstick in the other; each man thrusts his bamboo into the grave, and\r\ndrawing the stick along the groove of the bamboo points out to his\r\nsoul that in this way it may easily climb up out of the tomb. While\r\nthe earth is being shovelled in, the bamboos are kept out of the\r\nway, lest the souls should be in them, and so should be\r\ninadvertently buried with the earth as it is being thrown into the\r\ngrave; and when the people leave the spot they carry away the\r\nbamboos, begging their souls to come with them. Further, on\r\nreturning from the grave each Karen provides himself with three\r\nlittle hooks made of branches of trees, and calling his spirit to\r\nfollow him, at short intervals, as he returns, he makes a motion as\r\nif hooking it, and then thrusts the hook into the ground. This is\r\ndone to prevent the soul of the living from staying behind with the\r\nsoul of the dead. When the Karo-Bataks have buried somebody and are\r\nfilling in the grave, a sorceress runs about beating the air with a\r\nstick. This she does in order to drive away the souls of the\r\nsurvivors, for if one of these souls happened to slip into the grave\r\nand to be covered up with earth, its owner would die.\r\n\r\nIn Uea, one of the Loyalty Islands, the souls of the dead seem to\r\nhave been credited with the power of stealing the souls of the\r\nliving. For when a man was sick the soul-doctor would go with a\r\nlarge troop of men and women to the graveyard. Here the men played\r\non flutes and the women whistled softly to lure the soul home. After\r\nthis had gone on for some time they formed in procession and moved\r\nhomewards, the flutes playing and the women whistling all the way,\r\nwhile they led back the wandering soul and drove it gently along\r\nwith open palms. On entering the patient\'s dwelling they commanded\r\nthe soul in a loud voice to enter his body.\r\n\r\nOften the abduction of a man\'s soul is set down to demons. Thus fits\r\nand convulsions are generally ascribed by the Chinese to the agency\r\nof certain mischievous spirits who love to draw men\'s souls out of\r\ntheir bodies. At Amoy the spirits who serve babies and children in\r\nthis way rejoice in the high-sounding titles of "celestial agencies\r\nbestriding galloping horses" and "literary graduates residing\r\nhalfway up in the sky." When an infant is writhing in convulsions,\r\nthe frightened mother hastens to the roof of the house, and, waving\r\nabout a bamboo pole to which one of the child\'s garments is\r\nattached, cries out several times "My child So-and-so, come back,\r\nreturn home!" Meantime, another inmate of the house bangs away at a\r\ngong in the hope of attracting the attention of the strayed soul,\r\nwhich is supposed to recognise the familiar garment and to slip into\r\nit. The garment containing the soul is then placed on or beside the\r\nchild, and if the child does not die recovery is sure to follow,\r\nsooner or later. Similarly some Indians catch a man\'s lost soul in\r\nhis boots and restore it to his body by putting his feet into them.\r\n\r\nIn the Moluccas when a man is unwell it is thought that some devil\r\nhas carried away his soul to the tree, mountain, or hill where he\r\n(the devil) resides. A sorcerer having pointed out the devil\'s\r\nabode, the friends of the patient carry thither cooked rice, fruit,\r\nfish, raw eggs, a hen, a chicken, a silken robe, gold, armlets, and\r\nso forth. Having set out the food in order they pray, saying: "We\r\ncome to offer to you, O devil, this offering of food, clothes, gold,\r\nand so on; take it and release the soul of the patient for whom we\r\npray. Let it return to his body, and he who now is sick shall be\r\nmade whole." Then they eat a little and let the hen loose as a\r\nransom for the soul of the patient; also they put down the raw eggs;\r\nbut the silken robe, the gold, and the armlets they take home with\r\nthem. As soon as they are come to the house they place a flat bowl\r\ncontaining the offerings which have been brought back at the sick\r\nman\'s head, and say to him: "Now is your soul released, and you\r\nshall fare well and live to grey hairs on the earth."\r\n\r\nDemons are especially feared by persons who have just entered a new\r\nhouse. Hence at a house-warming among the Alfoors of Minahassa in\r\nCelebes the priest performs a ceremony for the purpose of restoring\r\ntheir souls to the inmates. He hangs up a bag at the place of\r\nsacrifice and then goes through a list of the gods. There are so\r\nmany of them that this takes him the whole night through without\r\nstopping. In the morning he offers the gods an egg and some rice. By\r\nthis time the souls of the household are supposed to be gathered in\r\nthe bag. So the priest takes the bag, and holding it on the head of\r\nthe master of the house, says, "Here you have your soul; go (soul)\r\nto-morrow away again." He then does the same, saying the same words,\r\nto the housewife and all the other members of the family. Amongst\r\nthe same Alfoors one way of recovering a sick man\'s soul is to let\r\ndown a bowl by a belt out of a window and fish for the soul till it\r\nis caught in the bowl and hauled up. And among the same people, when\r\na priest is bringing back a sick man\'s soul which he has caught in a\r\ncloth, he is preceded by a girl holding the large leaf of a certain\r\npalm over his head as an umbrella to keep him and the soul from\r\ngetting wet, in case it should rain; and he is followed by a man\r\nbrandishing a sword to deter other souls from any attempt at\r\nrescuing the captured spirit.\r\n\r\nSometimes the lost soul is brought back in a visible shape. The\r\nSalish or Flathead Indians of Oregon believe that a man\'s soul may\r\nbe separated for a time from his body without causing death and\r\nwithout the man being aware of his loss. It is necessary, however,\r\nthat the lost soul should be soon found and restored to its owner or\r\nhe will die. The name of the man who has lost his soul is revealed\r\nin a dream to the medicine-man, who hastens to inform the sufferer\r\nof his loss. Generally a number of men have sustained a like loss at\r\nthe same time; all their names are revealed to the medicine-man, and\r\nall employ him to recover their souls. The whole night long these\r\nsoulless men go about the village from lodge to lodge, dancing and\r\nsinging. Towards daybreak they go into a separate lodge, which is\r\nclosed up so as to be totally dark. A small hole is then made in the\r\nroof, through which the medicine-man, with a bunch of feathers,\r\nbrushes in the souls, in the shape of bits of bone and the like,\r\nwhich he receives on a piece of matting. A fire is next kindled, by\r\nthe light of which the medicine-man sorts out the souls. First he\r\nputs aside the souls of dead people, of which there are usually\r\nseveral; for if he were to give the soul of a dead person to a\r\nliving man, the man would die instantly. Next he picks out the souls\r\nof all the persons present, and making them all to sit down before\r\nhim, he takes the soul of each, in the shape of a splinter of bone,\r\nwood, or shell, and placing it on the owner\'s head, pats it with\r\nmany prayers and contortions till it descends into the heart and so\r\nresumes its proper place.\r\n\r\nAgain, souls may be extracted from their bodies or detained on their\r\nwanderings not only by ghosts and demons but also by men, especially\r\nby sorcerers. In Fiji, if a criminal refused to confess, the chief\r\nsent for a scarf with which "to catch away the soul of the rogue."\r\nAt the sight or even at the mention of the scarf the culprit\r\ngenerally made a clean breast. For if he did not, the scarf would be\r\nwaved over his head till his soul was caught in it, when it would be\r\ncarefully folded up and nailed to the end of a chief\'s canoe; and\r\nfor want of his soul the criminal would pine and die. The sorcerers\r\nof Danger Island used to set snares for souls. The snares were made\r\nof stout cinet, about fifteen to thirty feet long, with loops on\r\neither side of different sizes, to suit the different sizes of\r\nsouls; for fat souls there were large loops, for thin souls there\r\nwere small ones. When a man was sick against whom the sorcerers had\r\na grudge, they set up these soul-snares near his house and watched\r\nfor the flight of his soul. If in the shape of a bird or an insect\r\nit was caught in the snare, the man would infallibly die. In some\r\nparts of West Africa, indeed, wizards are continually setting traps\r\nto catch souls that wander from their bodies in sleep; and when they\r\nhave caught one, they tie it up over the fire, and as it shrivels in\r\nthe heat the owner sickens. This is done, not out of any grudge\r\ntowards the sufferer, but purely as a matter of business. The wizard\r\ndoes not care whose soul he has captured, and will readily restore\r\nit to its owner, if only he is paid for doing so. Some sorcerers\r\nkeep regular asylums for strayed souls, and anybody who has lost or\r\nmislaid his own soul can always have another one from the asylum on\r\npayment of the usual fee. No blame whatever attaches to men who keep\r\nthese private asylums or set traps for passing souls; it is their\r\nprofession, and in the exercise of it they are actuated by no harsh\r\nor unkindly feelings. But there are also wretches who from pure\r\nspite or for the sake of lucre set and bait traps with the\r\ndeliberate purpose of catching the soul of a particular man; and in\r\nthe bottom of the pot, hidden by the bait, are knives and sharp\r\nhooks which tear and rend the poor soul, either killing it outright\r\nor mauling it so as to impair the health of its owner when it\r\nsucceeds in escaping and returning to him. Miss Kingsley knew a\r\nKruman who became very anxious about his soul, because for several\r\nnights he had smelt in his dreams the savoury smell of smoked\r\ncrawfish seasoned with red pepper. Clearly some ill-wisher had set a\r\ntrap baited with this dainty for his dream-soul, intending to do him\r\ngrievous bodily, or rather spiritual, harm; and for the next few\r\nnights great pains were taken to keep his soul from straying abroad\r\nin his sleep. In the sweltering heat of the tropical night he lay\r\nsweating and snorting under a blanket, his nose and mouth tied up\r\nwith a handkerchief to prevent the escape of his precious soul. In\r\nHawaii there were sorcerers who caught souls of living people, shut\r\nthem up in calabashes, and gave them to people to eat. By squeezing\r\na captured soul in their hands they discovered the place where\r\npeople had been secretly buried.\r\n\r\nNowhere perhaps is the art of abducting human souls more carefully\r\ncultivated or carried to higher perfection than in the Malay\r\nPeninsula. Here the methods by which the wizard works his will are\r\nvarious, and so too are his motives. Sometimes he desires to destroy\r\nan enemy, sometimes to win the love of a cold or bashful beauty.\r\nThus, to take an instance of the latter sort of charm, the following\r\nare the directions given for securing the soul of one whom you wish\r\nto render distraught. When the moon, just risen, looks red above the\r\neastern horizon, go out, and standing in the moonlight, with the big\r\ntoe of your right foot on the big toe of your left, make a\r\nspeaking-trumpet of your right hand and recite through it the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "OM. I loose my shaft, I loose it and the moon clouds over,\r\n    I loose it, and the sun is extinguished.\r\n    I loose it, and the stars burn dim.\r\n    But it is not the sun, moon, and stars that I shoot at,\r\n    It is the stalk of the heart of that child of the congregation,\r\n    So-and-so.\r\n\r\n    Cluck! cluck! soul of So-and-so, come and walk with me,\r\n    Come and sit with me,\r\n    Come and sleep and share my pillow.\r\n    Cluck! cluck! soul."\r\n\r\n\r\nRepeat this thrice and after every repetition blow through your\r\nhollow fist. Or you may catch the soul in your turban, thus. Go out\r\non the night of the full moon and the two succeeding nights; sit\r\ndown on an ant-hill facing the moon, burn incense, and recite the\r\nfollowing incantation:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "I bring you a betel leaf to chew,\r\n    Dab the lime on to it, Prince Ferocious,\r\n    For Somebody, Prince Distraction\'s daughter, to chew.\r\n    Somebody at sunrise be distraught for love of me\r\n    Somebody at sunset be distraught for love of me.\r\n    As you remember your parents, remember me;\r\n    As you remember your house and houseladder, remember me;\r\n    When thunder rumbles, remember me;\r\n    When wind whistles, remember me;\r\n    When the heavens rain, remember me;\r\n    When cocks crow, remember me;\r\n    When the dial-bird tells its tales, remember me;\r\n    When you look up at the sun, remember me;\r\n    When you look up at the moon, remember me,\r\n    For in that self-same moon I am there.\r\n    Cluck! cluck! soul of Somebody come hither to me.\r\n    I do not mean to let you have my soul,\r\n    Let your soul come hither to mine."\r\n\r\n\r\nNow wave the end of your turban towards the moon seven times each\r\nnight. Go home and put it under your pillow, and if you want to wear\r\nit in the daytime, burn incense and say, "It is not a turban that I\r\ncarry in my girdle, but the soul of Somebody."\r\n\r\nThe Indians of the Nass River, in British Columbia, are impressed\r\nwith a belief that a physician may swallow his patient\'s soul by\r\nmistake. A doctor who is believed to have done so is made by the\r\nother members of the faculty to stand over the patient, while one of\r\nthem thrusts his fingers down the doctor\'s throat, another kneads\r\nhim in the stomach with his knuckles, and a third slaps him on the\r\nback. If the soul is not in him after all, and if the same process\r\nhas been repeated upon all the medical men without success, it is\r\nconcluded that the soul must be in the head-doctor\'s box. A party of\r\ndoctors, therefore, waits upon him at his house and requests him to\r\nproduce his box. When he has done so and arranged its contents on a\r\nnew mat, they take the votary of Aesculapius and hold him up by the\r\nheels with his head in a hole in the floor. In this position they\r\nwash his head, and "any water remaining from the ablution is taken\r\nand poured upon the sick man\'s head." No doubt the lost soul is in\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The Soul as a Shadow and a Reflection\r\n\r\nBUT the spiritual dangers I have enumerated are not the only ones\r\nwhich beset the savage. Often he regards his shadow or reflection as\r\nhis soul, or at all events as a vital part of himself, and as such\r\nit is necessarily a source of danger to him. For if it is trampled\r\nupon, struck, or stabbed, he will feel the injury as if it were done\r\nto his person; and if it is detached from him entirely (as he\r\nbelieves that it may be) he will die. In the island of Wetar there\r\nare magicians who can make a man ill by stabbing his shadow with a\r\npike or hacking it with a sword. After Sankara had destroyed the\r\nBuddhists in India, it is said that he journeyed to Nepaul, where he\r\nhad some difference of opinion with the Grand Lama. To prove his\r\nsupernatural powers, he soared into the air. But as he mounted up\r\nthe Grand Lama, perceiving his shadow swaying and wavering on the\r\nground, struck his knife into it and down fell Sankara and broke his\r\nneck.\r\n\r\nIn the Banks Islands there are some stones of a remarkably long\r\nshape which go by the name of "eating ghosts," because certain\r\npowerful and dangerous ghosts are believed to lodge in them. If a\r\nman\'s shadow falls on one of these stones, the ghost will draw his\r\nsoul out from him, so that he will die. Such stones, therefore, are\r\nset in a house to guard it; and a messenger sent to a house by the\r\nabsent owner will call out the name of the sender, lest the watchful\r\nghost in the stone should fancy that he came with evil intent and\r\nshould do him a mischief. At a funeral in China, when the lid is\r\nabout to be placed on the coffin, most of the bystanders, with the\r\nexception of the nearest kin, retire a few steps or even retreat to\r\nanother room, for a person\'s health is believed to be endangered by\r\nallowing his shadow to be enclosed in a coffin. And when the coffin\r\nis about to be lowered into the grave most of the spectators recoil\r\nto a little distance lest their shadows should fall into the grave\r\nand harm should thus be done to their persons. The geomancer and his\r\nassistants stand on the side of the grave which is turned away from\r\nthe sun; and the grave-diggers and coffin-bearers attach their\r\nshadows firmly to their persons by tying a strip of cloth tightly\r\nround their waists. Nor is it human beings alone who are thus liable\r\nto be injured by means of their shadows. Animals are to some extent\r\nin the same predicament. A small snail, which frequents the\r\nneighbourhood of the limestone hills in Perak, is believed to suck\r\nthe blood of cattle through their shadows; hence the beasts grow\r\nlean and sometimes die from loss of blood. The ancients supposed\r\nthat in Arabia, if a hyaena trod on a man\'s shadow, it deprived him\r\nof the power of speech and motion; and that if a dog, standing on a\r\nroof in the moonlight, cast a shadow on the ground and a hyaena trod\r\non it, the dog would fall down as if dragged with a rope. Clearly in\r\nthese cases the shadow, if not equivalent to the soul, is at least\r\nregarded as a living part of the man or the animal, so that injury\r\ndone to the shadow is felt by the person or animal as if it were\r\ndone to his body.\r\n\r\nConversely, if the shadow is a vital part of a man or an animal, it\r\nmay under certain circumstances be as hazardous to be touched by it\r\nas it would be to come into contact with the person or animal. Hence\r\nthe savage makes it a rule to shun the shadow of certain persons\r\nwhom for various reasons he regards as sources of dangerous\r\ninfluence. Amongst the dangerous classes he commonly ranks mourners\r\nand women in general, but especially his mother-in-law. The Shuswap\r\nIndians think that the shadow of a mourner falling upon a person\r\nwould make him sick. Amongst the Kurnai of Victoria novices at\r\ninitiation were cautioned not to let a woman\'s shadow fall across\r\nthem, as this would make them thin, lazy, and stupid. An Australian\r\nnative is said to have once nearly died of fright because the shadow\r\nof his mother-in-law fell on his legs as he lay asleep under a tree.\r\nThe awe and dread with which the untutored savage contemplates his\r\nmother-in-law are amongst the most familiar facts of anthropology.\r\nIn the Yuin tribes of New South Wales the rule which forbade a man\r\nto hold any communication with his wife\'s mother was very strict. He\r\nmight not look at her or even in her direction. It was a ground of\r\ndivorce if his shadow happened to fall on his mother-in-law: in that\r\ncase he had to leave his wife, and she returned to her parents. In\r\nNew Britain the native imagination fails to conceive the extent and\r\nnature of the calamities which would result from a man\'s\r\naccidentally speaking to his wife\'s mother; suicide of one or both\r\nwould probably be the only course open to them. The most solemn form\r\nof oath a New Briton can take is, "Sir, if I am not telling the\r\ntruth, I hope I may shake hands with my mother-in-law."\r\n\r\nWhere the shadow is regarded as so intimately bound up with the life\r\nof the man that its loss entails debility or death, it is natural to\r\nexpect that its diminution should be regarded with solicitude and\r\napprehension, as betokening a corresponding decrease in the vital\r\nenergy of its owner. In Amboyna and Uliase, two islands near the\r\nequator, where necessarily there is little or no shadow cast at\r\nnoon, the people make it a rule not to go out of the house at\r\nmid-day, because they fancy that by doing so a man may lose the\r\nshadow of his soul. The Mangaians tell of a mighty warrior,\r\nTukaitawa, whose strength waxed and waned with the length of his\r\nshadow. In the morning, when his shadow fell longest, his strength\r\nwas greatest; but as the shadow shortened towards noon his strength\r\nebbed with it, till exactly at noon it reached its lowest point;\r\nthen, as the shadow stretched out in the afternoon, his strength\r\nreturned. A certain hero discovered the secret of Tukaitawa\'s\r\nstrength and slew him at noon. The savage Besisis of the Malay\r\nPeninsula fear to bury their dead at noon, because they fancy that\r\nthe shortness of their shadows at that hour would sympathetically\r\nshorten their own lives.\r\n\r\nNowhere, perhaps, does the equivalence of the shadow to the life or\r\nsoul come out more clearly than in some customs practised to this\r\nday in South-eastern Europe. In modern Greece, when the foundation\r\nof a new building is being laid, it is the custom to kill a cock, a\r\nram, or a lamb, and to let its blood flow on the foundation-stone,\r\nunder which the animal is afterwards buried. The object of the\r\nsacrifice is to give strength and stability to the building. But\r\nsometimes, instead of killing an animal, the builder entices a man\r\nto the foundation-stone, secretly measures his body, or a part of\r\nit, or his shadow, and buries the measure under the\r\nfoundation-stone; or he lays the foundation-stone upon the man\'s\r\nshadow. It is believed that the man will die within the year. The\r\nRoumanians of Transylvania think that he whose shadow is thus\r\nimmured will die within forty days; so persons passing by a building\r\nwhich is in course of erection may hear a warning cry, "Beware lest\r\nthey take thy shadow!" Not long ago there were still shadow-traders\r\nwhose business it was to provide architects with the shadows\r\nnecessary for securing their walls. In these cases the measure of\r\nthe shadow is looked on as equivalent to the shadow itself, and to\r\nbury it is to bury the life or soul of the man, who, deprived of it,\r\nmust die. Thus the custom is a substitute for the old practice of\r\nimmuring a living person in the walls, or crushing him under the\r\nfoundation-stone of a new building, in order to give strength and\r\ndurability to the structure, or more definitely in order that the\r\nangry ghost may haunt the place and guard it against the intrusion\r\nof enemies.\r\n\r\nAs some peoples believe a man\'s soul to be in his shadow, so other\r\n(or the same) peoples believe it to be in his reflection in water or\r\na mirror. Thus "the Andamanese do not regard their shadows but their\r\nreflections (in any mirror) as their souls." When the Motumotu of\r\nNew Guinea first saw their likenesses in a looking-glass, they\r\nthought that their reflections were their souls. In New Caledonia\r\nthe old men are of opinion that a person\'s reflection in water or a\r\nmirror is his soul; but the younger men, taught by the Catholic\r\npriests, maintain that it is a reflection and nothing more, just\r\nlike the reflection of palm-trees in the water. The reflection-soul,\r\nbeing external to the man, is exposed to much the same dangers as\r\nthe shadow-soul. The Zulus will not look into a dark pool because\r\nthey think there is a beast in it which will take away their\r\nreflections, so that they die. The Basutos say that crocodiles have\r\nthe power of thus killing a man by dragging his reflection under\r\nwater. When one of them dies suddenly and from no apparent cause,\r\nhis relatives will allege that a crocodile must have taken his\r\nshadow some time when he crossed a stream. In Saddle Island,\r\nMelanesia, there is a pool "into which if any one looks he dies; the\r\nmalignant spirit takes hold upon his life by means of his reflection\r\non the water."\r\n\r\nWe can now understand why it was a maxim both in ancient India and\r\nancient Greece not to look at one\'s reflection in water, and why the\r\nGreeks regarded it as an omen of death if a man dreamed of seeing\r\nhimself so reflected. They feared that the water-spirits would drag\r\nthe person\'s reflection or soul under water, leaving him soulless to\r\nperish. This was probably the origin of the classical story of the\r\nbeautiful Narcissus, who languished and died through seeing his\r\nreflection in the water.\r\n\r\nFurther, we can now explain the widespread custom of covering up\r\nmirrors or turning them to the wall after a death has taken place in\r\nthe house. It is feared that the soul, projected out of the person\r\nin the shape of his reflection in the mirror, may be carried off by\r\nthe ghost of the departed, which is commonly supposed to linger\r\nabout the house till the burial. The custom is thus exactly parallel\r\nto the Aru custom of not sleeping in a house after a death for fear\r\nthat the soul, projected out of the body in a dream, may meet the\r\nghost and be carried off by it. The reason why sick people should\r\nnot see themselves in a mirror, and why the mirror in a sick-room is\r\ntherefore covered up, is also plain; in time of sickness, when the\r\nsoul might take flight so easily, it is particularly dangerous to\r\nproject it out of the body by means of the reflection in a mirror.\r\nThe rule is therefore precisely parallel to the rule observed by\r\nsome peoples of not allowing sick people to sleep; for in sleep the\r\nsoul is projected out of the body, and there is always a risk that\r\nit may not return.\r\n\r\nAs with shadows and reflections, so with portraits; they are often\r\nbelieved to contain the soul of the person portrayed. People who\r\nhold this belief are naturally loth to have their likenesses taken;\r\nfor if the portrait is the soul, or at least a vital part of the\r\nperson portrayed, whoever possesses the portrait will be able to\r\nexercise a fatal influence over the original of it. Thus the\r\nEsquimaux of Bering Strait believe that persons dealing in\r\nwitchcraft have the power of stealing a person\'s shade, so that\r\nwithout it he will pine away and die. Once at a village on the lower\r\nYukon River an explorer had set up his camera to get a picture of\r\nthe people as they were moving about among their houses. While he\r\nwas focusing the instrument, the headman of the village came up and\r\ninsisted on peeping under the cloth. Being allowed to do so, he\r\ngazed intently for a minute at the moving figures on the ground\r\nglass, then suddenly withdrew his head and bawled at the top of his\r\nvoice to the people, "He has all of your shades in this box." A\r\npanic ensued among the group, and in an instant they disappeared\r\nhelterskelter into their houses. The Tepehuanes of Mexico stood in\r\nmortal terror of the camera, and five days\' persuasion was necessary\r\nto induce them to pose for it. When at last they consented, they\r\nlooked like criminals about to be executed. They believed that by\r\nphotographing people the artist could carry off their souls and\r\ndevour them at his leisure moments. They said that, when the\r\npictures reached his country, they would die or some other evil\r\nwould befall them. When Dr. Catat and some companions were exploring\r\nthe Bara country on the west coast of Madagascar, the people\r\nsuddenly became hostile. The day before the travellers, not without\r\ndifficulty, had photographed the royal family, and now found\r\nthemselves accused of taking the souls of the natives for the\r\npurpose of selling them when they returned to France. Denial was\r\nvain; in compliance with the custom of the country they were obliged\r\nto catch the souls, which were then put into a basket and ordered by\r\nDr. Catat to return to their respective owners.\r\n\r\nSome villagers in Sikhim betrayed a lively horror and hid away\r\nwhenever the lens of a camera, or "the evil eye of the box" as they\r\ncalled it, was turned on them. They thought it took away their souls\r\nwith their pictures, and so put it in the power of the owner of the\r\npictures to cast spells on them, and they alleged that a photograph\r\nof the scenery blighted the landscape. Until the reign of the late\r\nKing of Siam no Siamese coins were ever stamped with the image of\r\nthe king, "for at that time there was a strong prejudice against the\r\nmaking of portraits in any medium. Europeans who travel into the\r\njungle have, even at the present time, only to point a camera at a\r\ncrowd to procure its instant dispersion. When a copy of the face of\r\na person is made and taken away from him, a portion of his life goes\r\nwith the picture. Unless the sovereign had been blessed with the\r\nyears of a Methusaleh he could scarcely have permitted his life to\r\nbe distributed in small pieces together with the coins of the\r\nrealm."\r\n\r\nBeliefs of the same sort still linger in various parts of Europe.\r\nNot very many years ago some old women in the Greek island of\r\nCarpathus were very angry at having their likenesses drawn, thinking\r\nthat in consequence they would pine and die. There are persons in\r\nthe West of Scotland "who refuse to have their likenesses taken lest\r\nit prove unlucky; and give as instances the cases of several of\r\ntheir friends who never had a day\'s health after being\r\nphotographed."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX. Tabooed Acts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Taboos on Intercourse with Strangers\r\n\r\nSO much for the primitive conceptions of the soul and the dangers to\r\nwhich it is exposed. These conceptions are not limited to one people\r\nor country; with variations of detail they are found all over the\r\nworld, and survive, as we have seen, in modern Europe. Beliefs so\r\ndeep-seated and so widespread must necessarily have contributed to\r\nshape the mould in which the early kingship was cast. For if every\r\nperson was at such pains to save his own soul from the perils which\r\nthreatened it on so many sides, how much more carefully must _he_\r\nhave been guarded upon whose life hung the welfare and even the\r\nexistence of the whole people, and whom therefore it was the common\r\ninterest of all to preserve? Therefore we should expect to find the\r\nking\'s life protected by a system of precautions or safeguards still\r\nmore numerous and minute than those which in primitive society every\r\nman adopts for the safety of his own soul. Now in point of fact the\r\nlife of the early kings is regulated, as we have seen and shall see\r\nmore fully presently, by a very exact code of rules. May we not then\r\nconjecture that these rules are in fact the very safeguards which we\r\nshould expect to find adopted for the protection of the king\'s life?\r\nAn examination of the rules themselves confirms this conjecture. For\r\nfrom this it appears that some of the rules observed by the kings\r\nare identical with those observed by private persons out of regard\r\nfor the safety of their souls; and even of those which seem peculiar\r\nto the king, many, if not all, are most readily explained on the\r\nhypothesis that they are nothing but safeguards or lifeguards of the\r\nking. I will now enumerate some of these royal rules or taboos,\r\noffering on each of them such comments and explanations as may serve\r\nto set the original intention of the rule in its proper light.\r\n\r\nAs the object of the royal taboos is to isolate the king from all\r\nsources of danger, their general effect is to compel him to live in\r\na state of seclusion, more or less complete, according to the number\r\nand stringency of the rules he observes. Now of all sources of\r\ndanger none are more dreaded by the savage than magic and\r\nwitchcraft, and he suspects all strangers of practising these black\r\narts. To guard against the baneful influence exerted voluntarily or\r\ninvoluntarily by strangers is therefore an elementary dictate of\r\nsavage prudence. Hence before strangers are allowed to enter a\r\ndistrict, or at least before they are permitted to mingle freely\r\nwith the inhabitants, certain ceremonies are often performed by the\r\nnatives of the country for the purpose of disarming the strangers of\r\ntheir magical powers, of counteracting the baneful influence which\r\nis believed to emanate from them, or of disinfecting, so to speak,\r\nthe tainted atmosphere by which they are supposed to be surrounded.\r\nThus, when the ambassadors sent by Justin II., Emperor of the East,\r\nto conclude a peace with the Turks had reached their destination,\r\nthey were received by shamans, who subjected them to a ceremonial\r\npurification for the purpose of exorcising all harmful influence.\r\nHaving deposited the goods brought by the ambassadors in an open\r\nplace, these wizards carried burning branches of incense round them,\r\nwhile they rang a bell and beat on a tambourine, snorting and\r\nfalling into a state of frenzy in their efforts to dispel the powers\r\nof evil. Afterwards they purified the ambassadors themselves by\r\nleading them through the flames. In the island of Nanumea (South\r\nPacific) strangers from ships or from other islands were not allowed\r\nto communicate with the people until they all, or a few as\r\nrepresentatives of the rest, had been taken to each of the four\r\ntemples in the island, and prayers offered that the god would avert\r\nany disease or treachery which these strangers might have brought\r\nwith them. Meat offerings were also laid upon the altars,\r\naccompanied by songs and dances in honour of the god. While these\r\nceremonies were going on, all the people except the priests and\r\ntheir attendants kept out of sight. Amongst the Ot Danoms of Borneo\r\nit is the custom that strangers entering the territory should pay to\r\nthe natives a certain sum, which is spent in the sacrifice of\r\nbuffaloes or pigs to the spirits of the land and water, in order to\r\nreconcile them to the presence of the strangers, and to induce them\r\nnot to withdraw their favour from the people of the country, but to\r\nbless the rice-harvest, and so forth. The men of a certain district\r\nin Borneo, fearing to look upon a European traveller lest he should\r\nmake them ill, warned their wives and children not to go near him.\r\nThose who could not restrain their curiosity killed fowls to appease\r\nthe evil spirits and smeared themselves with the blood. "More\r\ndreaded," says a traveller in Central Borneo, "than the evil spirits\r\nof the neighbourhood are the evil spirits from a distance which\r\naccompany travellers. When a company from the middle Mahakam River\r\nvisited me among the Blu-u Kayans in the year 1897, no woman showed\r\nherself outside her house without a burning bundle of _plehiding_\r\nbark, the stinking smoke of which drives away evil spirits."\r\n\r\nWhen Crevaux was travelling in South America he entered a village of\r\nthe Apalai Indians. A few moments after his arrival some of the\r\nIndians brought him a number of large black ants, of a species whose\r\nbite is painful, fastened on palm leaves. Then all the people of the\r\nvillage, without distinction of age or sex, presented themselves to\r\nhim, and he had to sting them all with the ants on their faces,\r\nthighs, and other parts of their bodies. Sometimes, when he applied\r\nthe ants too tenderly, they called out "More! more!" and were not\r\nsatisfied till their skin was thickly studded with tiny swellings\r\nlike what might have been produced by whipping them with nettles.\r\nThe object of this ceremony is made plain by the custom observed in\r\nAmboyna and Uliase of sprinkling sick people with pungent spices,\r\nsuch as ginger and cloves, chewed fine, in order by the prickling\r\nsensation to drive away the demon of disease which may be clinging\r\nto their persons. In Java a popular cure for gout or rheumatism is\r\nto rub Spanish pepper into the nails of the fingers and toes of the\r\nsufferer; the pungency of the pepper is supposed to be too much for\r\nthe gout or rheumatism, who accordingly departs in haste. So on the\r\nSlave Coast the mother of a sick child sometimes believes that an\r\nevil spirit has taken possession of the child\'s body, and in order\r\nto drive him out, she makes small cuts in the body of the little\r\nsufferer and inserts green peppers or spices in the wounds,\r\nbelieving that she will thereby hurt the evil spirit and force him\r\nto be gone. The poor child naturally screams with pain, but the\r\nmother hardens her heart in the belief that the demon is suffering\r\nequally.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the same dread of strangers, rather than any\r\ndesire to do them honour, is the motive of certain ceremonies which\r\nare sometimes observed at their reception, but of which the\r\nintention is not directly stated. In the Ongtong Java Islands, which\r\nare inhabited by Polynesians, the priests or sorcerers seem to wield\r\ngreat influence. Their main business is to summon or exorcise\r\nspirits for the purpose of averting or dispelling sickness, and of\r\nprocuring favourable winds, a good catch of fish, and so on. When\r\nstrangers land on the islands, they are first of all received by the\r\nsorcerers, sprinkled with water, anointed with oil, and girt with\r\ndried pandanus leaves. At the same time sand and water are freely\r\nthrown about in all directions, and the newcomer and his boat are\r\nwiped with green leaves. After this ceremony the strangers are\r\nintroduced by the sorcerers to the chief. In Afghanistan and in some\r\nparts of Persia the traveller, before he enters a village, is\r\nfrequently received with a sacrifice of animal life or food, or of\r\nfire and incense. The Afghan Boundary Mission, in passing by\r\nvillages in Afghanistan, was often met with fire and incense.\r\nSometimes a tray of lighted embers is thrown under the hoofs of the\r\ntraveller\'s horse, with the words, "You are welcome." On entering a\r\nvillage in Central Africa Emin Pasha was received with the sacrifice\r\nof two goats; their blood was sprinkled on the path and the chief\r\nstepped over the blood to greet Emin. Sometimes the dread of\r\nstrangers and their magic is too great to allow of their reception\r\non any terms. Thus when Speke arrived at a certain village, the\r\nnatives shut their doors against him, "because they had never before\r\nseen a white man nor the tin boxes that the men were carrying: \'Who\r\nknows,\' they said, \'but that these very boxes are the plundering\r\nWatuta transformed and come to kill us? You cannot be admitted.\' No\r\npersuasion could avail with them, and the party had to proceed to\r\nthe next village."\r\n\r\nThe fear thus entertained of alien visitors is often mutual.\r\nEntering a strange land the savage feels that he is treading\r\nenchanted ground, and he takes steps to guard against the demons\r\nthat haunt it and the magical arts of its inhabitants. Thus on going\r\nto a strange land the Maoris performed certain ceremonies to make it\r\n"common," lest it might have been previously "sacred." When Baron\r\nMiklucho-Maclay was approaching a village on the Maclay Coast of New\r\nGuinea, one of the natives who accompanied him broke a branch from a\r\ntree and going aside whispered to it for a while; then stepping up\r\nto each member of the party, one after another, he spat something\r\nupon his back and gave him some blows with the branch. Lastly, he\r\nwent into the forest and buried the branch under withered leaves in\r\nthe thickest part of the jungle. This ceremony was believed to\r\nprotect the party against all treachery and danger in the village\r\nthey were approaching. The idea probably was that the malignant\r\ninfluences were drawn off from the persons into the branch and\r\nburied with it in the depths of the forest. In Australia, when a\r\nstrange tribe has been invited into a district and is approaching\r\nthe encampment of the tribe which owns the land, "the strangers\r\ncarry lighted bark or burning sticks in their hands, for the\r\npurpose, they say, of clearing and purifying the air." When the\r\nToradjas are on a head-hunting expedition and have entered the\r\nenemy\'s country, they may not eat any fruits which the foe has\r\nplanted nor any animal which he has reared until they have first\r\ncommitted an act of hostility, as by burning a house or killing a\r\nman. They think that if they broke this rule they would receive\r\nsomething of the soul or spiritual essence of the enemy into\r\nthemselves, which would destroy the mystic virtue of their\r\ntalismans.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is believed that a man who has been on a journey may have\r\ncontracted some magic evil from the strangers with whom he has\r\nassociated. Hence, on returning home, before he is readmitted to the\r\nsociety of his tribe and friends, he has to undergo certain\r\npurificatory ceremonies. Thus the Bechuanas "cleanse or purify\r\nthemselves after journeys by shaving their heads, etc., lest they\r\nshould have contracted from strangers some evil by witchcraft or\r\nsorcery." In some parts of Western Africa, when a man returns home\r\nafter a long absence, before he is allowed to visit his wife, he\r\nmust wash his person with a particular fluid, and receive from the\r\nsorcerer a certain mark on his forehead, in order to counteract any\r\nmagic spell which a stranger woman may have cast on him in his\r\nabsence, and which might be communicated through him to the women of\r\nhis village. Two Hindoo ambassadors, who had been sent to England by\r\na native prince and had returned to India, were considered to have\r\nso polluted themselves by contact with strangers that nothing but\r\nbeing born again could restore them to purity. "For the purpose of\r\nregeneration it is directed to make an image of pure gold of the\r\nfemale power of nature, in the shape either of a woman or of a cow.\r\nIn this statue the person to be regenerated is enclosed, and dragged\r\nthrough the usual channel. As a statue of pure gold and of proper\r\ndimensions would be too expensive, it is sufficient to make an image\r\nof the sacred _Yoni,_ through which the person to be regenerated is\r\nto pass." Such an image of pure gold was made at the prince\'s\r\ncommand, and his ambassadors were born again by being dragged\r\nthrough it.\r\n\r\nWhen precautions like these are taken on behalf of the people in\r\ngeneral against the malignant influence supposed to be exercised by\r\nstrangers, it is no wonder that special measures are adopted to\r\nprotect the king from the same insidious danger. In the middle ages\r\nthe envoys who visited a Tartar Khan were obliged to pass between\r\ntwo fires before they were admitted to his presence, and the gifts\r\nthey brought were also carried between the fires. The reason\r\nassigned for the custom was that the fire purged away any magic\r\ninfluence which the strangers might mean to exercise over the Khan.\r\nWhen subject chiefs come with their retinues to visit Kalamba (the\r\nmost powerful chief of the Bashilange in the Congo Basin) for the\r\nfirst time or after being rebellious, they have to bathe, men and\r\nwomen together, in two brooks on two successive days, passing the\r\nnights under the open sky in the market-place. After the second bath\r\nthey proceed, entirely naked, to the house of Kalamba, who makes a\r\nlong white mark on the breast and forehead of each of them. Then\r\nthey return to the market-place and dress, after which they undergo\r\nthe pepper ordeal. Pepper is dropped into the eyes of each of them,\r\nand while this is being done the sufferer has to make a confession\r\nof all his sins, to answer all questions that may be put to him, and\r\nto take certain vows. This ends the ceremony, and the strangers are\r\nnow free to take up their quarters in the town for as long as they\r\nchoose to remain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Taboos on Eating and Drinking\r\n\r\nIN THE OPINION of savages the acts of eating and drinking are\r\nattended with special danger; for at these times the soul may escape\r\nfrom the mouth, or be extracted by the magic arts of an enemy\r\npresent. Among the Ewe-speaking peoples of the Slave Coast "the\r\ncommon belief seems to be that the indwelling spirit leaves the body\r\nand returns to it through the mouth; hence, should it have gone out,\r\nit behoves a man to be careful about opening his mouth, lest a\r\nhomeless spirit should take advantage of the opportunity and enter\r\nhis body. This, it appears, is considered most likely to take place\r\nwhile the man is eating." Precautions are therefore adopted to guard\r\nagainst these dangers. Thus of the Bataks it is said that "since the\r\nsoul can leave the body, they always take care to prevent their soul\r\nfrom straying on occasions when they have most need of it. But it is\r\nonly possible to prevent the soul from straying when one is in the\r\nhouse. At feasts one may find the whole house shut up, in order that\r\nthe soul may stay and enjoy the good things set before it." The\r\nZafimanelo in Madagascar lock their doors when they eat, and hardly\r\nany one ever sees them eating. The Warua will not allow any one to\r\nsee them eating and drinking, being doubly particular that no person\r\nof the opposite sex shall see them doing so. "I had to pay a man to\r\nlet me see him drink; I could not make a man let a woman see him\r\ndrink." When offered a drink they often ask that a cloth may be held\r\nup to hide them whilst drinking.\r\n\r\nIf these are the ordinary precautions taken by common people, the\r\nprecautions taken by kings are extraordinary. The king of Loango may\r\nnot be seen eating or drinking by man or beast under pain of death.\r\nA favourite dog having broken into the room where the king was\r\ndining, the king ordered it to be killed on the spot. Once the\r\nking\'s own son, a boy of twelve years old, inadvertently saw the\r\nking drink. Immediately the king ordered him to be finely apparelled\r\nand feasted, after which he commanded him to be cut in quarters, and\r\ncarried about the city with a proclamation that he had seen the king\r\ndrink. "When the king has a mind to drink, he has a cup of wine\r\nbrought; he that brings it has a bell in his hand, and as soon as he\r\nhas delivered the cup to the king, he turns his face from him and\r\nrings the bell, on which all present fall down with their faces to\r\nthe ground, and continue so till the king has drank. . . . His\r\neating is much in the same style, for which he has a house on\r\npurpose, where his victuals are set upon a bensa or table: which he\r\ngoes to, and shuts the door: when he has done, he knocks and comes\r\nout. So that none ever see the king eat or drink. For it is believed\r\nthat if any one should, the king shall immediately die." The\r\nremnants of his food are buried, doubtless to prevent them from\r\nfalling into the hands of sorcerers, who by means of these fragments\r\nmight cast a fatal spell over the monarch. The rules observed by the\r\nneighbouring king of Cacongo were similar; it was thought that the\r\nking would die if any of his subjects were to see him drink. It is a\r\ncapital offence to see the king of Dahomey at his meals. When he\r\ndrinks in public, as he does on extraordinary occasions, he hides\r\nhimself behind a curtain, or handkerchiefs are held up round his\r\nhead, and all the people throw themselves with their faces to the\r\nearth. When the king of Bunyoro in Central Africa went to drink milk\r\nin the dairy, every man must leave the royal enclosure and all the\r\nwomen had to cover their heads till the king returned. No one might\r\nsee him drink. One wife accompanied him to the dairy and handed him\r\nthe milk-pot, but she turned away her face while he drained it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Taboos on Showing the Face\r\n\r\nIN SOME of the preceding cases the intention of eating and drinking\r\nin strict seclusion may perhaps be to hinder evil influences from\r\nentering the body rather than to prevent the escape of the soul.\r\nThis certainly is the motive of some drinking customs observed by\r\nnatives of the Congo region. Thus we are told of these people that\r\n"there is hardly a native who would dare to swallow a liquid without\r\nfirst conjuring the spirits. One of them rings a bell all the time\r\nhe is drinking; another crouches down and places his left hand on\r\nthe earth; another veils his head; another puts a stalk of grass or\r\na leaf in his hair, or marks his forehead with a line of clay. This\r\nfetish custom assumes very varied forms. To explain them, the black\r\nis satisfied to say that they are an energetic mode of conjuring\r\nspirits." In this part of the world a chief will commonly ring a\r\nbell at each draught of beer which he swallows, and at the same\r\nmoment a lad stationed in front of him brandishes a spear "to keep\r\nat bay the spirits which might try to sneak into the old chief\'s\r\nbody by the same road as the beer." The same motive of warding off\r\nevil spirits probably explains the custom observed by some African\r\nsultans of veiling their faces. The Sultan of Darfur wraps up his\r\nface with a piece of white muslin, which goes round his head several\r\ntimes, covering his mouth and nose first, and then his forehead, so\r\nthat only his eyes are visible. The same custom of veiling the face\r\nas a mark of sovereignty is said to be observed in other parts of\r\nCentral Africa. The Sultan of Wadai always speaks from behind a\r\ncurtain; no one sees his face except his intimates and a few\r\nfavoured persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Taboos on Quitting the House\r\n\r\nBY AN EXTENSION of the like precaution kings are sometimes forbidden\r\never to leave their palaces; or, if they are allowed to do so, their\r\nsubjects are forbidden to see them abroad. The fetish king of Benin,\r\nwho was worshipped as a deity by his subjects, might not quit his\r\npalace. After his coronation the king of Loango is confined to his\r\npalace, which he may not leave. The king of Onitsha "does not step\r\nout of his house into the town unless a human sacrifice is made to\r\npropitiate the gods: on this account he never goes out beyond the\r\nprecincts of his premises." Indeed we are told that he may not quit\r\nhis palace under pain of death or of giving up one or more slaves to\r\nbe executed in his presence. As the wealth of the country is\r\nmeasured in slaves, the king takes good care not to infringe the\r\nlaw. Yet once a year at the Feast of Yams the king is allowed, and\r\neven required by custom, to dance before his people outside the high\r\nmud wall of the palace. In dancing he carries a great weight,\r\ngenerally a sack of earth, on his back to prove that he is still\r\nable to support the burden and cares of state. Were he unable to\r\ndischarge this duty, he would be immediately deposed and perhaps\r\nstoned. The kings of Ethiopia were worshipped as gods, but were\r\nmostly kept shut up in their palaces. On the mountainous coast of\r\nPontus there dwelt in antiquity a rude and warlike people named the\r\nMosyni or Mosynoeci, through whose rugged country the Ten Thousand\r\nmarched on their famous retreat from Asia to Europe. These\r\nbarbarians kept their king in close custody at the top of a high\r\ntower, from which after his election he was never more allowed to\r\ndescend. Here he dispensed justice to his people; but if he offended\r\nthem, they punished him by stopping his rations for a whole day, or\r\neven starving him to death. The kings of Sabaea or Sheba, the spice\r\ncountry of Arabia, were not allowed to go out of their palaces; if\r\nthey did so, the mob stoned them to death. But at the top of the\r\npalace there was a window with a chain attached to it. If any man\r\ndeemed he had suffered wrong, he pulled the chain, and the king\r\nperceived him and called him in and gave judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Taboos on Leaving Food over\r\n\r\nAGAIN, magic mischief may be wrought upon a man through the remains\r\nof the food he has partaken of, or the dishes out of which he has\r\neaten. On the principles of sympathetic magic a real connexion\r\ncontinues to subsist between the food which a man has in his stomach\r\nand the refuse of it which he has left untouched, and hence by\r\ninjuring the refuse you can simultaneously injure the eater. Among\r\nthe Narrinyeri of South Australia every adult is constantly on the\r\nlook-out for bones of beasts, birds, or fish, of which the flesh has\r\nbeen eaten by somebody, in order to construct a deadly charm out of\r\nthem. Every one is therefore careful to burn the bones of the\r\nanimals which he has eaten, lest they should fall into the hands of\r\na sorcerer. Too often, however, the sorcerer succeeds in getting\r\nhold of such a bone, and when he does so he believes that he has the\r\npower of life and death over the man, woman, or child who ate the\r\nflesh of the animal. To put the charm in operation he makes a paste\r\nof red ochre and fish oil, inserts in it the eye of a cod and a\r\nsmall piece of the flesh of a corpse, and having rolled the compound\r\ninto a ball sticks it on the top of the bone. After being left for\r\nsome time in the bosom of a dead body, in order that it may derive a\r\ndeadly potency by contact with corruption, the magical implement is\r\nset up in the ground near the fire, and as the ball melts, so the\r\nperson against whom the charm is directed wastes with disease; if\r\nthe ball is melted quite away, the victim will die. When the\r\nbewitched man learns of the spell that is being cast upon him, he\r\nendeavours to buy the bone from the sorcerer, and if he obtains it\r\nhe breaks the charm by throwing the bone into a river or lake. In\r\nTana, one of the New Hebrides, people bury or throw into the sea the\r\nleavings of their food, lest these should fall into the hands of the\r\ndisease-makers. For if a disease-maker finds the remnants of a meal,\r\nsay the skin of a banana, he picks it up and burns it slowly in the\r\nfire. As it burns, the person who ate the banana falls ill and sends\r\nto the disease-maker, offering him presents if he will stop burning\r\nthe banana skin. In New Guinea the natives take the utmost care to\r\ndestroy or conceal the husks and other remains of their food, lest\r\nthese should be found by their enemies and used by them for the\r\ninjury or destruction of the eaters. Hence they burn their leavings,\r\nthrow them into the sea, or otherwise put them out of harm\'s way.\r\n\r\nFrom a like fear, no doubt, of sorcery, no one may touch the food\r\nwhich the king of Loango leaves upon his plate; it is buried in a\r\nhole in the ground. And no one may drink out of the king\'s vessel.\r\nIn antiquity the Romans used immediately to break the shells of eggs\r\nand of snails which they had eaten, in order to prevent enemies from\r\nmaking magic with them. The common practice, still observed among\r\nus, of breaking egg-shells after the eggs have been eaten may very\r\nwell have originated in the same superstition.\r\n\r\nThe superstitious fear of the magic that may be wrought on a man\r\nthrough the leavings of his food has had the beneficial effect of\r\ninducing many savages to destroy refuse which, if left to rot, might\r\nthrough its corruption have proved a real, not a merely imaginary,\r\nsource of disease and death. Nor is it only the sanitary condition\r\nof a tribe which has benefited by this superstition; curiously\r\nenough the same baseless dread, the same false notion of causation,\r\nhas indirectly strengthened the moral bonds of hospitality, honour,\r\nand good faith among men who entertain it. For it is obvious that no\r\none who intends to harm a man by working magic on the refuse of his\r\nfood will himself partake of that food, because if he did so he\r\nwould, on the principles of sympathetic magic, suffer equally with\r\nhis enemy from any injury done to the refuse. This is the idea which\r\nin primitive society lends sanctity to the bond produced by eating\r\ntogether; by participation in the same food two men give, as it\r\nwere, hostages for their good behaviour; each guarantees the other\r\nthat he will devise no mischief against him, since, being physically\r\nunited with him by the common food in their stomachs, any harm he\r\nmight do to his fellow would recoil on his own head with precisely\r\nthe same force with which it fell on the head of his victim. In\r\nstrict logic, however, the sympathetic bond lasts only so long as\r\nthe food is in the stomach of each of the parties. Hence the\r\ncovenant formed by eating together is less solemn and durable than\r\nthe covenant formed by transfusing the blood of the covenanting\r\nparties into each other\'s veins, for this transfusion seems to knit\r\nthem together for life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX. Tabooed Persons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Chiefs and Kings tabooed\r\n\r\nWE have seen that the Mikado\'s food was cooked every day in new pots\r\nand served up in new dishes; both pots and dishes were of common\r\nclay, in order that they might be broken or laid aside after they\r\nhad been once used. They were generally broken, for it was believed\r\nthat if any one else ate his food out of these sacred dishes, his\r\nmouth and throat would become swollen and inflamed. The same ill\r\neffect was thought to be experienced by any one who should wear the\r\nMikado\'s clothes without his leave; he would have swellings and\r\npains all over his body. In Fiji there is a special name (_kana\r\nlama_) for the disease supposed to be caused by eating out of a\r\nchief\'s dishes or wearing his clothes. "The throat and body swell,\r\nand the impious person dies. I had a fine mat given to me by a man\r\nwho durst not use it because Thakombau\'s eldest son had sat upon it.\r\nThere was always a family or clan of commoners who were exempt from\r\nthis danger. I was talking about this once to Thakombau. \'Oh yes,\'\r\nsaid he. \'Here, So-and-so! come and scratch my back.\' The man\r\nscratched; he was one of those who could do it with impunity." The\r\nname of the men thus highly privileged was _Na nduka ni,_ or the\r\ndirt of the chief.\r\n\r\nIn the evil effects thus supposed to follow upon the use of the\r\nvessels or clothes of the Mikado and a Fijian chief we see that\r\nother side of the god-man\'s character to which attention has been\r\nalready called. The divine person is a source of danger as well as\r\nof blessing; he must not only be guarded, he must also be guarded\r\nagainst. His sacred organism, so delicate that a touch may disorder\r\nit, is also, as it were, electrically charged with a powerful\r\nmagical or spiritual force which may discharge itself with fatal\r\neffect on whatever comes in contact with it. Accordingly the\r\nisolation of the man-god is quite as necessary for the safety of\r\nothers as for his own. His magical virtue is in the strictest sense\r\nof the word contagious: his divinity is a fire, which, under proper\r\nrestraints, confers endless blessings, but, if rashly touched or\r\nallowed to break bounds, burns and destroys what it touches. Hence\r\nthe disastrous effects supposed to attend a breach of taboo; the\r\noffender has thrust his hand into the divine fire, which shrivels up\r\nand consumes him on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe Nubas, for example, who inhabit the wooded and fertile range of\r\nJebel Nuba in Eastern Africa, believe that they would die if they\r\nentered the house of their priestly king; however, they can evade\r\nthe penalty of their intrusion by baring the left shoulder and\r\ngetting the king to lay his hand on it. And were any man to sit on a\r\nstone which the king has consecrated to his own use, the\r\ntransgressor would die within the year. The Cazembes of Angola\r\nregard their king as so holy that no one can touch him without being\r\nkilled by the magical power which pervades his sacred person. But\r\nsince contact with him is sometimes unavoidable, they have devised a\r\nmeans whereby the sinner can escape with his life. Kneeling down\r\nbefore the king he touches the back of the royal hand with the back\r\nof his own, then snaps his fingers; afterwards he lays the palm of\r\nhis hand on the palm of the king\'s hand, then snaps his fingers\r\nagain. This ceremony is repeated four or five times, and averts the\r\nimminent danger of death. In Tonga it was believed that if any one\r\nfed himself with his own hands after touching the sacred person of a\r\nsuperior chief or anything that belonged to him, he would swell up\r\nand die; the sanctity of the chief, like a virulent poison, infected\r\nthe hands of his inferior, and, being communicated through them to\r\nthe food, proved fatal to the eater. A commoner who had incurred\r\nthis danger could disinfect himself by performing a certain\r\nceremony, which consisted in touching the sole of a chief\'s foot\r\nwith the palm and back of each of his hands, and afterwards rinsing\r\nhis hands in water. If there was no water near, he rubbed his hands\r\nwith the juicy stem of a plantain or banana. After that he was free\r\nto feed himself with his own hands without danger of being attacked\r\nby the malady which would otherwise follow from eating with tabooed\r\nor sanctified hands. But until the ceremony of expiation or\r\ndisinfection had been performed, if he wished to eat he had either\r\nto get some one to feed him, or else to go down on his knees and\r\npick up the food from the ground with his mouth like a beast. He\r\nmight not even use a toothpick himself, but might guide the hand of\r\nanother person holding the toothpick. The Tongans were subject to\r\ninduration of the liver and certain forms of scrofula, which they\r\noften attributed to a failure to perform the requisite expiation\r\nafter having inadvertently touched a chief or his belongings. Hence\r\nthey often went through the ceremony as a precaution, without\r\nknowing that they had done anything to call for it. The king of\r\nTonga could not refuse to play his part in the rite by presenting\r\nhis foot to such as desired to touch it, even when they applied to\r\nhim at an inconvenient time. A fat unwieldy king, who perceived his\r\nsubjects approaching with this intention, while he chanced to be\r\ntaking his walks abroad, has been sometimes seen to waddle as fast\r\nas his legs could carry him out of their way, in order to escape the\r\nimportunate and not wholly disinterested expression of their homage.\r\nIf any one fancied he might have already unwittingly eaten with\r\ntabooed hands, he sat down before the chief, and, taking the chief\'s\r\nfoot, pressed it against his own stomach, that the food in his belly\r\nmight not injure him, and that he might not swell up and die. Since\r\nscrofula was regarded by the Tongans as a result of eating with\r\ntabooed hands, we may conjecture that persons who suffered from it\r\namong them often resorted to the touch or pressure of the king\'s\r\nfoot as a cure for their malady. The analogy of the custom with the\r\nold English practice of bringing scrofulous patients to the king to\r\nbe healed by his touch is sufficiently obvious, and suggests, as I\r\nhave already pointed out elsewhere, that among our own remote\r\nancestors scrofula may have obtained its name of the King\'s Evil,\r\nfrom a belief, like that of the Tongans, that it was caused as well\r\nas cured by contact with the divine majesty of kings.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand the dread of the sanctity of chiefs was at least as\r\ngreat as in Tonga. Their ghostly power, derived from an ancestral\r\nspirit, diffused itself by contagion over everything they touched,\r\nand could strike dead all who rashly or unwittingly meddled with it.\r\nFor instance, it once happened that a New Zealand chief of high rank\r\nand great sanctity had left the remains of his dinner by the\r\nwayside. A slave, a stout, hungry fellow, coming up after the chief\r\nhad gone, saw the unfinished dinner, and ate it up without asking\r\nquestions. Hardly had he finished when he was informed by a\r\nhorror-stricken spectator that the food of which he had eaten was\r\nthe chief\'s. "I knew the unfortunate delinquent well. He was\r\nremarkable for courage, and had signalised himself in the wars of\r\nthe tribe," but "no sooner did he hear the fatal news than he was\r\nseized by the most extraordinary convulsions and cramp in the\r\nstomach, which never ceased till he died, about sundown the same\r\nday. He was a strong man, in the prime of life, and if any pakeha\r\n[European] freethinker should have said he was not killed by the\r\n_tapu_ of the chief, which had been communicated to the food by\r\ncontact, he would have been listened to with feelings of contempt\r\nfor his ignorance and inability to understand plain and direct\r\nevidence." This is not a solitary case. A Maori woman having eaten\r\nof some fruit, and being afterwards told that the fruit had been\r\ntaken from a tabooed place, exclaimed that the spirit of the chief,\r\nwhose sanctity had been thus profaned, would kill her. This was in\r\nthe afternoon, and next day by twelve o\'clock she was dead. A Maori\r\nchief\'s tinder-box was once the means of killing several persons;\r\nfor, having been lost by him, and found by some men who used it to\r\nlight their pipes, they died of fright on learning to whom it had\r\nbelonged. So, too, the garments of a high New Zealand chief will\r\nkill any one else who wears them. A chief was observed by a\r\nmissionary to throw down a precipice a blanket which he found too\r\nheavy to carry. Being asked by the missionary why he did not leave\r\nit on a tree for the use of a future traveller, the chief replied\r\nthat "it was the fear of its being taken by another which caused him\r\nto throw it where he did, for if it were worn, his tapu" (that is,\r\nhis spiritual power communicated by contact to the blanket and\r\nthrough the blanket to the man) "would kill the person." For a\r\nsimilar reason a Maori chief would not blow a fire with his mouth;\r\nfor his sacred breath would communicate its sanctity to the fire,\r\nwhich would pass it on to the pot on the fire, which would pass it\r\non to the meat in the pot, which would pass it on to the man who ate\r\nthe meat, which was in the pot, which stood on the fire, which was\r\nbreathed on by the chief; so that the eater, infected by the chief\'s\r\nbreath conveyed through these intermediaries, would surely die.\r\n\r\nThus in the Polynesian race, to which the Maoris belong,\r\nsuperstition erected round the persons of sacred chiefs a real,\r\nthough at the same time purely imaginary barrier, to transgress\r\nwhich actually entailed the death of the transgressor whenever he\r\nbecame aware of what he had done. This fatal power of the\r\nimagination working through superstitious terrors is by no means\r\nconfined to one race; it appears to be common among savages. For\r\nexample, among the aborigines of Australia a native will die after\r\nthe infliction of even the most superficial wound, if only he\r\nbelieves that the weapon which inflicted the wound had been sung\r\nover and thus endowed with magical virtue. He simply lies down,\r\nrefuses food, and pines away. Similarly among some of the Indian\r\ntribes of Brazil, if the medicine-man predicted the death of any one\r\nwho had offended him, "the wretch took to his hammock instantly in\r\nsuch full expectation of dying, that he would neither eat nor drink,\r\nand the prediction was a sentence which faith effectually executed."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Mourners tabooed\r\n\r\nTHUS regarding his sacred chiefs and kings as charged with a\r\nmysterious spiritual force which so to say explodes at contact, the\r\nsavage naturally ranks them among the dangerous classes of society,\r\nand imposes upon them the same sort of restraints that he lays on\r\nmanslayers, menstruous women, and other persons whom he looks upon\r\nwith a certain fear and horror. For example, sacred kings and\r\npriests in Polynesia were not allowed to touch food with their\r\nhands, and had therefore to be fed by others; and as we have just\r\nseen, their vessels, garments, and other property might not be used\r\nby others on pain of disease and death. Now precisely the same\r\nobservances are exacted by some savages from girls at their first\r\nmenstruation, women after childbirth, homicides, mourners, and all\r\npersons who have come into contact with the dead. Thus, for example,\r\nto begin with the last class of persons, among the Maoris any one\r\nwho had handled a corpse, helped to convey it to the grave, or\r\ntouched a dead man\'s bones, was cut off from all intercourse and\r\nalmost all communication with mankind. He could not enter any house,\r\nor come into contact with any person or thing, without utterly\r\nbedevilling them. He might not even touch food with his hands, which\r\nhad become so frightfully tabooed or unclean as to be quite useless.\r\nFood would be set for him on the ground, and he would then sit or\r\nkneel down, and, with his hands carefully held behind his back,\r\nwould gnaw at it as best he could. In some cases he would be fed by\r\nanother person, who with outstretched arm contrived to do it without\r\ntouching the tabooed man; but the feeder was himself subjected to\r\nmany severe restrictions, little less onerous than those which were\r\nimposed upon the other. In almost every populous village there lived\r\na degraded wretch, the lowest of the low, who earned a sorry\r\npittance by thus waiting upon the defiled. Clad in rags, daubed from\r\nhead to foot with red ochre and stinking shark oil, always solitary\r\nand silent, generally old, haggard, and wizened, often half crazed,\r\nhe might be seen sitting motionless all day apart from the common\r\npath or thoroughfare of the village, gazing with lack-lustre eyes on\r\nthe busy doings in which he might never take a part. Twice a day a\r\ndole of food would be thrown on the ground before him to munch as\r\nwell as he could without the use of his hands; and at night,\r\nhuddling his greasy tatters about him, he would crawl into some\r\nmiserable lair of leaves and refuse, where, dirty, cold, and hungry,\r\nhe passed, in broken ghost-haunted slumbers, a wretched night as a\r\nprelude to another wretched day. Such was the only human being\r\ndeemed fit to associate at arm\'s length with one who had paid the\r\nlast offices of respect and friendship to the dead. And when, the\r\ndismal term of his seclusion being over, the mourner was about to\r\nmix with his fellows once more, all the dishes he had used in his\r\nseclusion were diligently smashed, and all the garments he had worn\r\nwere carefully thrown away, lest they should spread the contagion of\r\nhis defilement among others, just as the vessels and clothes of\r\nsacred kings and chiefs are destroyed or cast away for a similar\r\nreason. So complete in these respects is the analogy which the\r\nsavage traces between the spiritual influences that emanate from\r\ndivinities and from the dead, between the odour of sanctity and the\r\nstench of corruption.\r\n\r\nThe rule which forbids persons who have been in contact with the\r\ndead to touch food with their hands would seem to have been\r\nuniversal in Polynesia. Thus in Samoa "those who attended the\r\ndeceased were most careful not to handle food, and for days were fed\r\nby others as if they were helpless infants. Baldness and the loss of\r\nteeth were supposed to be the punishment inflicted by the household\r\ngod if they violated the rule." Again, in Tonga, "no person can\r\ntouch a dead chief without being taboo\'d for ten lunar months,\r\nexcept chiefs, who are only taboo\'d for three, four, or five months,\r\naccording to the superiority of the dead chief; except again it be\r\nthe body of Tooitonga [the great divine chief], and then even the\r\ngreatest chief would be taboo\'d ten months. . . . During the time a\r\nman is taboo\'d he must not feed himself with his own hands, but must\r\nbe fed by somebody else: he must not even use a toothpick himself,\r\nbut must guide another person\'s hand holding the toothpick. If he is\r\nhungry and there is no one to feed him, he must go down upon his\r\nhands and knees, and pick up his victuals with his mouth: and if he\r\ninfringes upon any of these rules, it is firmly expected that he\r\nwill swell up and die."\r\n\r\nAmong the Shuswap of British Columbia widows and widowers in\r\nmourning are secluded and forbidden to touch their own head or body;\r\nthe cups and cooking-vessels which they use may be used by no one\r\nelse. They must build a sweat-house beside a creek, sweat there all\r\nnight and bathe regularly, after which they must rub their bodies\r\nwith branches of spruce. The branches may not be used more than\r\nonce, and when they have served their purpose they are stuck into\r\nthe ground all round the hut. No hunter would come near such\r\nmourners, for their presence is unlucky. If their shadow were to\r\nfall on any one, he would be taken ill at once. They employ thorn\r\nbushes for bed and pillow, in order to keep away the ghost of the\r\ndeceased; and thorn bushes are also laid all around their beds. This\r\nlast precaution shows clearly what the spiritual danger is which\r\nleads to the exclusion of such persons from ordinary society; it is\r\nsimply a fear of the ghost who is supposed to be hovering near them.\r\nIn the Mekeo district of British New Guinea a widower loses all his\r\ncivil rights and becomes a social outcast, an object of fear and\r\nhorror, shunned by all. He may not cultivate a garden, nor show\r\nhimself in public, nor traverse the village, nor walk on the roads\r\nand paths. Like a wild beast he must skulk in the long grass and the\r\nbushes; and if he sees or hears any one coming, especially a woman,\r\nhe must hide behind a tree or a thicket. If he wishes to fish or\r\nhunt, he must do it alone and at night. If he would consult any one,\r\neven the missionary, he does so by stealth and at night; he seems to\r\nhave lost his voice and speaks only in whispers. Were he to join a\r\nparty of fishers or hunters, his presence would bring misfortune on\r\nthem; the ghost of his dead wife would frighten away the fish or the\r\ngame. He goes about everywhere and at all times armed with a\r\ntomahawk to defend himself, not only against wild boars in the\r\njungle, but against the dreaded spirit of his departed spouse, who\r\nwould do him an ill turn if she could; for all the souls of the dead\r\nare malignant and their only delight is to harm the living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Women tabooed at Menstruation and Childbirth\r\n\r\nIN GENERAL, we may say that the prohibition to use the vessels,\r\ngarments, and so forth of certain persons, and the effects supposed\r\nto follow an infraction of the rule, are exactly the same whether\r\nthe persons to whom the things belong are sacred or what we might\r\ncall unclean and polluted. As the garments which have been touched\r\nby a sacred chief kill those who handle them, so do the things which\r\nhave been touched by a menstruous women. An Australian blackfellow,\r\nwho discovered that his wife had lain on his blanket at her\r\nmenstrual period, killed her and died of terror himself within a\r\nfortnight. Hence Australian women at these times are forbidden under\r\npain of death to touch anything that men use, or even to walk on a\r\npath that any man frequents. They are also secluded at childbirth,\r\nand all vessels used by them during their seclusion are burned. In\r\nUganda the pots which a woman touches, while the impurity of\r\nchildbirth or of menstruation is on her, should be destroyed; spears\r\nand shields defiled by her touch are not destroyed, but only\r\npurified. "Among all the D\xe9n\xe9 and most other American tribes, hardly\r\nany other being was the object of so much dread as a menstruating\r\nwoman. As soon as signs of that condition made themselves apparent\r\nin a young girl she was carefully segregated from all but female\r\ncompany, and had to live by herself in a small hut away from the\r\ngaze of the villagers or of the male members of the roving band.\r\nWhile in that awful state, she had to abstain from touching anything\r\nbelonging to man, or the spoils of any venison or other animal, lest\r\nshe would thereby pollute the same, and condemn the hunters to\r\nfailure, owing to the anger of the game thus slighted. Dried fish\r\nformed her diet, and cold water, absorbed through a drinking tube,\r\nwas her only beverage. Moreover, as the very sight of her was\r\ndangerous to society, a special skin bonnet, with fringes falling\r\nover her face down to her breast, hid her from the public gaze, even\r\nsome time after she had recovered her normal state." Among the\r\nBribri Indians of Costa Rica a menstruous woman is regarded as\r\nunclean. The only plates she may use for her food are banana leaves,\r\nwhich, when she has done with them, she throws away in some\r\nsequestered spot; for were a cow to find them and eat them, the\r\nanimal would waste away and perish. And she drinks out of a special\r\nvessel for a like reason; because if any one drank out of the same\r\ncup after her, he would surely die.\r\n\r\nAmong many peoples similar restrictions are imposed on women in\r\nchildbed and apparently for similar reasons; at such periods women\r\nare supposed to be in a dangerous condition which would infect any\r\nperson or thing they might touch; hence they are put into quarantine\r\nuntil, with the recovery of their health and strength, the imaginary\r\ndanger has passed away. Thus, in Tahiti a woman after childbirth was\r\nsecluded for a fortnight or three weeks in a temporary hut erected\r\non sacred ground; during the time of her seclusion she was debarred\r\nfrom touching provisions, and had to be fed by another. Further, if\r\nany one else touched the child at this period, he was subjected to\r\nthe same restrictions as the mother until the ceremony of her\r\npurification had been performed. Similarly in the island of Kadiak,\r\noff Alaska, a woman about to be delivered retires to a miserable low\r\nhovel built of reeds, where she must remain for twenty days after\r\nthe birth of her child, whatever the season may be, and she is\r\nconsidered so unclean that no one will touch her, and food is\r\nreached to her on sticks. The Bribri Indians regard the pollution of\r\nchildbed as much more dangerous even than that of menstruation. When\r\na woman feels her time approaching, she informs her husband, who\r\nmakes haste to build a hut for her in a lonely spot. There she must\r\nlive alone, holding no converse with anybody save her mother or\r\nanother woman. After her delivery the medicine-man purifies her by\r\nbreathing on her and laying an animal, it matters not what, upon\r\nher. But even this ceremony only mitigates her uncleanness into a\r\nstate considered to be equivalent to that of a menstruous woman; and\r\nfor a full lunar month she must live apart from her housemates,\r\nobserving the same rules with regard to eating and drinking as at\r\nher monthly periods. The case is still worse, the pollution is still\r\nmore deadly, if she has had a miscarriage or has been delivered of a\r\nstillborn child. In that case she may not go near a living soul: the\r\nmere contact with things she has used is exceedingly dangerous: her\r\nfood is handed to her at the end of a long stick. This lasts\r\ngenerally for three weeks, after which she may go home, subject only\r\nto the restrictions incident to an ordinary confinement.\r\n\r\nSome Bantu tribes entertain even more exaggerated notions of the\r\nvirulent infection spread by a woman who has had a miscarriage and\r\nhas concealed it. An experienced observer of these people tells us\r\nthat the blood of childbirth "appears to the eyes of the South\r\nAfricans to be tainted with a pollution still more dangerous than\r\nthat of the menstrual fluid. The husband is excluded from the hut\r\nfor eight days of the lying-in period, chiefly from fear that he\r\nmight be contaminated by this secretion. He dare not take his child\r\nin his arms for the three first months after the birth. But the\r\nsecretion of childbed is particularly terrible when it is the\r\nproduct of a miscarriage, especially _a concealed miscarriage._ In\r\nthis case it is not merely the man who is threatened or killed, it\r\nis the whole country, it is the sky itself which suffers. By a\r\ncurious association of ideas a physiological fact causes cosmic\r\ntroubles!" As for the disastrous effect which a miscarriage may have\r\non the whole country I will quote the words of a medicine-man and\r\nrain-maker of the Ba-Pedi tribe: "When a woman has had a\r\nmiscarriage, when she has allowed her blood to flow, and has hidden\r\nthe child, it is enough to cause the burning winds to blow and to\r\nparch the country with heat. The rain no longer falls, for the\r\ncountry is no longer in order. When the rain approaches the place\r\nwhere the blood is, it will not dare to approach. It will fear and\r\nremain at a distance. That woman has committed a great fault. She\r\nhas spoiled the country of the chief, for she has hidden blood which\r\nhad not yet been well congealed to fashion a man. That blood is\r\ntaboo. It should never drip on the road! The chief will assemble his\r\nmen and say to them, \'Are you in order in your villages?\' Some one\r\nwill answer, \'Such and such a woman was pregnant and we have not yet\r\nseen the child which she has given birth to.\' Then they go and\r\narrest the woman. They say to her, \'Show us where you have hidden\r\nit.\' They go and dig at the spot, they sprinkle the hole with a\r\ndecoction of two sorts of roots prepared in a special pot. They take\r\na little of the earth of this grave, they throw it into the river,\r\nthen they bring back water from the river and sprinkle it where she\r\nshed her blood. She herself must wash every day with the medicine.\r\nThen the country will be moistened again (by rain). Further, we\r\n(medicine-men), summon the women of the country; we tell them to\r\nprepare a ball of the earth which contains the blood. They bring it\r\nto us one morning. If we wish to prepare medicine with which to\r\nsprinkle the whole country, we crumble this earth to powder; at the\r\nend of five days we send little boys and little girls, girls that\r\nyet know nothing of women\'s affairs and have not yet had relations\r\nwith men. We put the medicine in the horns of oxen, and these\r\nchildren go to all the fords, to all the entrances of the country. A\r\nlittle girl turns up the soil with her mattock, the others dip a\r\nbranch in the horn and sprinkle the inside of the hole saying,\r\n\'Rain! rain!\' So we remove the misfortune which the women have\r\nbrought on the roads; the rain will be able to come. The country is\r\npurified!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Warriors tabooed\r\n\r\nONCE more, warriors are conceived by the savage to move, so to say,\r\nin an atmosphere of spiritual danger which constrains them to\r\npractise a variety of superstitious observances quite different in\r\ntheir nature from those rational precautions which, as a matter of\r\ncourse, they adopt against foes of flesh and blood. The general\r\neffect of these observances is to place the warrior, both before and\r\nafter victory, in the same state of seclusion or spiritual\r\nquarantine in which, for his own safety, primitive man puts his\r\nhuman gods and other dangerous characters. Thus when the Maoris went\r\nout on the war-path they were sacred or taboo in the highest degree,\r\nand they and their friends at home had to observe strictly many\r\ncurious customs over and above the numerous taboos of ordinary life.\r\nThey became, in the irreverent language of Europeans who knew them\r\nin the old fighting days, "tabooed an inch thick"; and as for the\r\nleader of the expedition, he was quite unapproachable. Similarly,\r\nwhen the Israelites marched forth to war they were bound by certain\r\nrules of ceremonial purity identical with rules observed by Maoris\r\nand Australian blackfellows on the war-path. The vessels they used\r\nwere sacred, and they had to practise continence and a custom of\r\npersonal cleanliness of which the original motive, if we may judge\r\nfrom the avowed motive of savages who conform to the same custom,\r\nwas a fear lest the enemy should obtain the refuse of their persons,\r\nand thus be enabled to work their destruction by magic. Among some\r\nIndian tribes of North America a young warrior in his first campaign\r\nhad to conform to certain customs, of which two were identical with\r\nthe observances imposed by the same Indians on girls at their first\r\nmenstruation: the vessels he ate and drank out of might be touched\r\nby no other person, and he was forbidden to scratch his head or any\r\nother part of his body with his fingers; if he could not help\r\nscratching himself, he had to do it with a stick. The latter rule,\r\nlike the one which forbids a tabooed person to feed himself with his\r\nown fingers, seems to rest on the supposed sanctity or pollution,\r\nwhichever we choose to call it, of the tabooed hands. Moreover among\r\nthese Indian tribes the men on the war-path had always to sleep at\r\nnight with their faces turned towards their own country; however\r\nuneasy the posture, they might not change it. They might not sit\r\nupon the bare ground, nor wet their feet, nor walk on a beaten path\r\nif they could help it; when they had no choice but to walk on a\r\npath, they sought to counteract the ill effect of doing so by\r\ndoctoring their legs with certain medicines or charms which they\r\ncarried with them for the purpose. No member of the party was\r\npermitted to step over the legs, hands, or body of any other member\r\nwho chanced to be sitting or lying on the ground; and it was equally\r\nforbidden to step over his blanket, gun, tomahawk, or anything that\r\nbelonged to him. If this rule was inadvertently broken, it became\r\nthe duty of the member whose person or property had been stepped\r\nover to knock the other member down, and it was similarly the duty\r\nof that other to be knocked down peaceably and without resistance.\r\nThe vessels out of which the warriors ate their food were commonly\r\nsmall bowls of wood or birch bark, with marks to distinguish the two\r\nsides; in marching from home the Indians invariably drank out of one\r\nside of the bowl, and in returning they drank out of the other. When\r\non their way home they came within a day\'s march of the village,\r\nthey hung up all their bowls on trees, or threw them away on the\r\nprairie, doubtless to prevent their sanctity or defilement from\r\nbeing communicated with disastrous effects to their friends, just as\r\nwe have seen that the vessels and clothes of the sacred Mikado, of\r\nwomen at childbirth and menstruation, and of persons defiled by\r\ncontact with the dead are destroyed or laid aside for a similar\r\nreason. The first four times that an Apache Indian goes out on the\r\nwar-path, he is bound to refrain from scratching his head with his\r\nfingers and from letting water touch his lips. Hence he scratches\r\nhis head with a stick, and drinks through a hollow reed or cane.\r\nStick and reed are attached to the warrior\'s belt and to each other\r\nby a leathern thong. The rule not to scratch their heads with their\r\nfingers, but to use a stick for the purpose instead, was regularly\r\nobserved by Ojebways on the war-path.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Creek Indians and kindred tribes we are told they\r\n"will not cohabit with women while they are out at war; they\r\nreligiously abstain from every kind of intercourse even with their\r\nown wives, for the space of three days and nights before they go to\r\nwar, and so after they return home, because they are to sanctify\r\nthemselves." Among the Ba-Pedi and Ba-Thonga tribes of South Africa\r\nnot only have the warriors to abstain from women, but the people\r\nleft behind in the villages are also bound to continence; they think\r\nthat any incontinence on their part would cause thorns to grow on\r\nthe ground traversed by the warriors, and that success would not\r\nattend the expedition.\r\n\r\nWhy exactly many savages have made it a rule to refrain from women\r\nin time of war, we cannot say for certain, but we may conjecture\r\nthat their motive was a superstitious fear lest, on the principles\r\nof sympathetic magic, close contact with women should infect them\r\nwith feminine weakness and cowardice. Similarly some savages imagine\r\nthat contact with a woman in childbed enervates warriors and\r\nenfeebles their weapons. Indeed the Kayans of Central Borneo go so\r\nfar as to hold that to touch a loom or women\'s clothes would so\r\nweaken a man that he would have no success in hunting, fishing, and\r\nwar. Hence it is not merely sexual intercourse with women that the\r\nsavage warrior sometimes shuns; he is careful to avoid the sex\r\naltogether. Thus among the hill tribes of Assam, not only are men\r\nforbidden to cohabit with their wives during or after a raid, but\r\nthey may not eat food cooked by a woman; nay, they should not\r\naddress a word even to their own wives. Once a woman, who\r\nunwittingly broke the rule by speaking to her husband while he was\r\nunder the war taboo, sickened and died when she learned the awful\r\ncrime she had committed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Manslayers tabooed\r\n\r\nIF THE READER still doubts whether the rules of conduct which we\r\nhave just been considering are based on superstitious fears or\r\ndictated by a rational prudence, his doubts will probably be\r\ndissipated when he learns that rules of the same sort are often\r\nimposed even more stringently on warriors after the victory has been\r\nwon and when all fear of the living corporeal foe is at an end. In\r\nsuch cases one motive for the inconvenient restrictions laid on the\r\nvictors in their hour of triumph is probably a dread of the angry\r\nghosts of the slain; and that the fear of the vengeful ghosts does\r\ninfluence the behaviour of the slayers is often expressly affirmed.\r\nThe general effect of the taboos laid on sacred chiefs, mourners,\r\nwomen at childbirth, men on the war-path, and so on, is to seclude\r\nor isolate the tabooed persons from ordinary society, this effect\r\nbeing attained by a variety of rules, which oblige the men or women\r\nto live in separate huts or in the open air, to shun the commerce of\r\nthe sexes, to avoid the use of vessels employed by others, and so\r\nforth. Now the same effect is produced by similar means in the case\r\nof victorious warriors, particularly such as have actually shed the\r\nblood of their enemies. In the island of Timor, when a warlike\r\nexpedition has returned in triumph bringing the heads of the\r\nvanquished foe, the leader of the expedition is forbidden by\r\nreligion and custom to return at once to his own house. A special\r\nhut is prepared for him, in which he has to reside for two months,\r\nundergoing bodily and spiritual purification. During this time he\r\nmay not go to his wife nor feed himself; the food must be put into\r\nhis mouth by another person. That these observances are dictated by\r\nfear of the ghosts of the slain seems certain; for from another\r\naccount of the ceremonies performed on the return of a successful\r\nhead-hunter in the same island we learn that sacrifices are offered\r\non this occasion to appease the soul of the man whose head has been\r\ntaken; the people think that some misfortune would befall the victor\r\nwere such offerings omitted. Moreover, a part of the ceremony\r\nconsists of a dance accompanied by a song, in which the death of the\r\nslain man is lamented and his forgiveness is entreated. "Be not\r\nangry," they say, "because your head is here with us; had we been\r\nless lucky, our heads might now have been exposed in your village.\r\nWe have offered the sacrifice to appease you. Your spirit may now\r\nrest and leave us at peace. Why were you our enemy? Would it not\r\nhave been better that we should remain friends? Then your blood\r\nwould not have been spilt and your head would not have been cut\r\noff." The people of Paloo in Central Celebes take the heads of their\r\nenemies in war and afterwards propitiate the souls of the slain in\r\nthe temple.\r\n\r\nAmong the tribes at the mouth of the Wanigela River, in New Guinea,\r\n"a man who has taken life is considered to be impure until he has\r\nundergone certain ceremonies: as soon as possible after the deed he\r\ncleanses himself and his weapon. This satisfactorily accomplished,\r\nhe repairs to his village and seats himself on the logs of\r\nsacrificial staging. No one approaches him or takes any notice\r\nwhatever of him. A house is prepared for him which is put in charge\r\nof two or three small boys as servants. He may eat only toasted\r\nbananas, and only the centre portion of them--the ends being thrown\r\naway. On the third day of his seclusion a small feast is prepared by\r\nhis friends, who also fashion some new perineal bands for him. This\r\nis called _ivi poro._ The next day the man dons all his best\r\nornaments and badges for taking life, and sallies forth fully armed\r\nand parades the village. The next day a hunt is organised, and a\r\nkangaroo selected from the game captured. It is cut open and the\r\nspleen and liver rubbed over the back of the man. He then walks\r\nsolemnly down to the nearest water, and standing straddle-legs in it\r\nwashes himself. All the young untried warriors swim between his\r\nlegs. This is supposed to impart courage and strength to them. The\r\nfollowing day, at early dawn, he dashes out of his house, fully\r\narmed, and calls aloud the name of his victim. Having satisfied\r\nhimself that he has thoroughly scared the ghost of the dead man, he\r\nreturns to his house. The beating of flooring-boards and the\r\nlighting of fires is also a certain method of scaring the ghost. A\r\nday later his purification is finished. He can then enter his wife\'s\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\nIn Windessi, Dutch New Guinea, when a party of head-hunters has been\r\nsuccessful, and they are nearing home, they announce their approach\r\nand success by blowing on triton shells. Their canoes are also\r\ndecked with branches. The faces of the men who have taken a head are\r\nblackened with charcoal. If several have taken part in killing the\r\nsame victim, his head is divided among them. They always time their\r\narrival so as to reach home in the early morning. They come rowing\r\nto the village with a great noise, and the women stand ready to\r\ndance in the verandahs of the houses. The canoes row past the _room\r\nsram_ or house where the young men live; and as they pass, the\r\nmurderers throw as many pointed sticks or bamboos at the wall or the\r\nroof as there were enemies killed. The day is spent very quietly.\r\nNow and then they drum or blow on the conch; at other times they\r\nbeat the walls of the houses with loud shouts to drive away the\r\nghosts of the slain. So the Yabim of New Guinea believe that the\r\nspirit of a murdered man pursues his murderer and seeks to do him a\r\nmischief. Hence they drive away the spirit with shouts and the\r\nbeating of drums. When the Fijians had buried a man alive, as they\r\noften did, they used at nightfall to make a great uproar by means of\r\nbamboos, trumpet-shells, and so forth, for the purpose of\r\nfrightening away his ghost, lest he should attempt to return to his\r\nold home. And to render his house unattractive to him they\r\ndismantled it and clothed it with everything that to their ideas\r\nseemed most repulsive. On the evening of the day on which they had\r\ntortured a prisoner to death, the American Indians were wont to run\r\nthrough the village with hideous yells, beating with sticks on the\r\nfurniture, the walls, and the roofs of the huts to prevent the angry\r\nghost of their victim from settling there and taking vengeance for\r\nthe torments that his body had endured at their hands. "Once," says\r\na traveller, "on approaching in the night a village of Ottawas, I\r\nfound all the inhabitants in confusion: they were all busily engaged\r\nin raising noises of the loudest and most inharmonious kind. Upon\r\ninquiry, I found that a battle had been lately fought between the\r\nOttawas and the Kickapoos, and that the object of all this noise was\r\nto prevent the ghosts of the departed combatants from entering the\r\nvillage."\r\n\r\nAmong the Basutos "ablution is specially performed on return from\r\nbattle. It is absolutely necessary that the warriors should rid\r\nthemselves, as soon as possible, of the blood they have shed, or the\r\nshades of their victims would pursue them incessantly, and disturb\r\ntheir slumbers. They go in a procession, and in full armour, to the\r\nnearest stream. At the moment they enter the water a diviner, placed\r\nhigher up, throws some purifying substances into the current. This\r\nis, however, not strictly necessary. The javelins and battle-axes\r\nalso undergo the process of washing." Among the Bageshu of East\r\nAfrica a man who has killed another may not return to his own house\r\non the same day, though he may enter the village and spend the night\r\nin a friend\'s house. He kills a sheep and smears his chest, his\r\nright arm, and his head with the contents of the animal\'s stomach.\r\nHis children are brought to him and he smears them in like manner.\r\nThen he smears each side of the doorway with the tripe and entrails,\r\nand finally throws the rest of the stomach on the roof of his house.\r\nFor a whole day he may not touch food with his hands, but picks it\r\nup with two sticks and so conveys it to his mouth. His wife is not\r\nunder any such restrictions. She may even go to mourn for the man\r\nwhom her husband has killed, if she wishes to do so. Among the\r\nAngoni, to the north of the Zambesi, warriors who have slain foes on\r\nan expedition smear their bodies and faces with ashes, hang garments\r\nof their victims on their persons, and tie bark ropes round their\r\nnecks, so that the ends hang down over their shoulders or breasts.\r\nThis costume they wear for three days after their return, and rising\r\nat break of day they run through the village uttering frightful\r\nyells to drive away the ghosts of the slain, which, if they were not\r\nthus banished from the houses, might bring sickness and misfortune\r\non the inmates.\r\n\r\nIn some of these accounts nothing is said of an enforced seclusion,\r\nat least after the ceremonial cleansing, but some South African\r\ntribes certainly require the slayer of a very gallant foe in war to\r\nkeep apart from his wife and family for ten days after he has washed\r\nhis body in running water. He also receives from the tribal doctor a\r\nmedicine which he chews with his food. When a Nandi of East Africa\r\nhas killed a member of another tribe, he paints one side of his\r\nbody, spear, and sword red, and the other side white. For four days\r\nafter the slaughter he is considered unclean and may not go home. He\r\nhas to build a small shelter by a river and live there; he may not\r\nassociate with his wife or sweetheart, and he may eat nothing but\r\nporridge, beef, and goat\'s flesh. At the end of the fourth day he\r\nmust purify himself by taking a strong purge made from the bark of\r\nthe _segetet_ tree and by drinking goat\'s milk mixed with blood.\r\nAmong the Bantu tribes of Kavirondo, when a man has killed an enemy\r\nin warfare he shaves his head on his return home, and his friends\r\nrub a medicine, which generally consists of goat\'s dung, over his\r\nbody to prevent the spirit of the slain man from troubling him.\r\nExactly the same custom is practised for the same reason by the\r\nWageia of East Africa. With the Ja-Luo of Kavirondo the custom is\r\nsomewhat different. Three days after his return from the fight the\r\nwarrior shaves his head. But before he may enter his village he has\r\nto hang a live fowl, head uppermost, round his neck; then the bird\r\nis decapitated and its head left hanging round his neck. Soon after\r\nhis return a feast is made for the slain man, in order that his\r\nghost may not haunt his slayer. In the Pelew Islands, when the men\r\nreturn from a warlike expedition in which they have taken a life,\r\nthe young warriors who have been out fighting for the first time,\r\nand all who handled the slain, are shut up in the large\r\ncouncil-house and become tabooed. They may not quit the edifice, nor\r\nbathe, nor touch a woman, nor eat fish; their food is limited to\r\ncoco-nuts and syrup. They rub themselves with charmed leaves and\r\nchew charmed betel. After three days they go together to bathe as\r\nnear as possible to the spot where the man was killed.\r\n\r\nAmong the Natchez Indians of North America young braves who had\r\ntaken their first scalps were obliged to observe certain rules of\r\nabstinence for six months. They might not sleep with their wives nor\r\neat flesh; their only food was fish and hasty-pudding. If they broke\r\nthese rules, they believed that the soul of the man they had killed\r\nwould work their death by magic, that they would gain no more\r\nsuccesses over the enemy, and that the least wound inflicted on them\r\nwould prove mortal. When a Choctaw had killed an enemy and taken his\r\nscalp, he went into mourning for a month, during which he might not\r\ncomb his hair, and if his head itched he might not scratch it except\r\nwith a little stick which he wore fastened to his wrist for the\r\npurpose. This ceremonial mourning for the enemies they had slain was\r\nnot uncommon among the North American Indians.\r\n\r\nThus we see that warriors who have taken the life of a foe in battle\r\nare temporarily cut off from free intercourse with their fellows,\r\nand especially with their wives, and must undergo certain rites of\r\npurification before they are readmitted to society. Now if the\r\npurpose of their seclusion and of the expiatory rites which they\r\nhave to perform is, as we have been led to believe, no other than to\r\nshake off, frighten, or appease the angry spirit of the slain man,\r\nwe may safely conjecture that the similar purification of homicides\r\nand murderers, who have imbrued their hands in the blood of a\r\nfellow-tribesman, had at first the same significance, and that the\r\nidea of a moral or spiritual regeneration symbolised by the washing,\r\nthe fasting, and so on, was merely a later interpretation put upon\r\nthe old custom by men who had outgrown the primitive modes of\r\nthought in which the custom originated. The conjecture will be\r\nconfirmed if we can show that savages have actually imposed certain\r\nrestrictions on the murderer of a fellow-tribesman from a definite\r\nfear that he is haunted by the ghost of his victim. This we can do\r\nwith regard to the Omahas of North America. Among these Indians the\r\nkinsmen of a murdered man had the right to put the murderer to\r\ndeath, but sometimes they waived their right in consideration of\r\npresents which they consented to accept. When the life of the\r\nmurderer was spared, he had to observe certain stringent rules for a\r\nperiod which varied from two to four years. He must walk barefoot,\r\nand he might eat no warm food, nor raise his voice, nor look around.\r\nHe was compelled to pull his robe about him and to have it tied at\r\nthe neck even in hot weather; he might not let it hang loose or fly\r\nopen. He might not move his hands about, but had to keep them close\r\nto his body. He might not comb his hair, and it might not be blown\r\nabout by the wind. When the tribe went out hunting, he was obliged\r\nto pitch his tent about a quarter of mile from the rest of the\r\npeople "lest the ghost of his victim should raise a high wind, which\r\nmight cause damage." Only one of his kindred was allowed to remain\r\nwith him at his tent. No one wished to eat with him, for they said,\r\n"If we eat with him whom Wakanda hates, Wakanda will hate us."\r\nSometimes he wandered at night crying and lamenting his offence. At\r\nthe end of his long isolation the kinsmen of the murdered man heard\r\nhis crying and said, "It is enough. Begone, and walk among the\r\ncrowd. Put on moccasins and wear a good robe." Here the reason\r\nalleged for keeping the murderer at a considerable distance from the\r\nhunters gives the clue to all the other restrictions laid on him: he\r\nwas haunted and therefore dangerous. The ancient Greeks believed\r\nthat the soul of a man who had just been killed was wroth with his\r\nslayer and troubled him; wherefore it was needful even for the\r\ninvoluntary homicide to depart from his country for a year until the\r\nanger of the dead man had cooled down; nor might the slayer return\r\nuntil sacrifice had been offered and ceremonies of purification\r\nperformed. If his victim chanced to be a foreigner, the homicide had\r\nto shun the native country of the dead man as well as his own. The\r\nlegend of the matricide Orestes, how he roamed from place to place\r\npursued by the Furies of his murdered mother, and none would sit at\r\nmeat with him, or take him in, till he had been purified, reflects\r\nfaithfully the real Greek dread of such as were still haunted by an\r\nangry ghost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Hunters and Fishers tabooed\r\n\r\nIN SAVAGE society the hunter and the fisherman have often to observe\r\nrules of abstinence and to submit to ceremonies of purification of\r\nthe same sort as those which are obligatory on the warrior and the\r\nmanslayer; and though we cannot in all cases perceive the exact\r\npurpose which these rules and ceremonies are supposed to serve, we\r\nmay with some probability assume that, just as the dread of the\r\nspirits of his enemies is the main motive for the seclusion and\r\npurification of the warrior who hopes to take or has already taken\r\ntheir lives, so the huntsman or fisherman who complies with similar\r\ncustoms is principally actuated by a fear of the spirits of the\r\nbeasts, birds, or fish which he has killed or intends to kill. For\r\nthe savage commonly conceives animals to be endowed with souls and\r\nintelligences like his own, and hence he naturally treats them with\r\nsimilar respect. Just as he attempts to appease the ghosts of the\r\nmen he has slain, so he essays to propitiate the spirits of the\r\nanimals he has killed. These ceremonies of propitiation will be\r\ndescribed later on in this work; here we have to deal, first, with\r\nthe taboos observed by the hunter and the fisherman before or during\r\nthe hunting and fishing seasons, and, second, with the ceremonies of\r\npurification which have to be practised by these men on returning\r\nwith their booty from a successful chase.\r\n\r\nWhile the savage respects, more or less, the souls of all animals,\r\nhe treats with particular deference the spirits of such as are\r\neither especially useful to him or formidable on account of their\r\nsize, strength, or ferocity. Accordingly the hunting and killing of\r\nthese valuable or dangerous beasts are subject to more elaborate\r\nrules and ceremonies than the slaughter of comparatively useless and\r\ninsignificant creatures. Thus the Indians of Nootka Sound prepared\r\nthemselves for catching whales by observing a fast for a week,\r\nduring which they ate very little, bathed in the water several times\r\na day, sang, and rubbed their bodies, limbs, and faces with shells\r\nand bushes till they looked as if they had been severely torn with\r\nbriars. They were likewise required to abstain from any commerce\r\nwith their women for the like period, this last condition being\r\nconsidered indispensable to their success. A chief who failed to\r\ncatch a whale has been known to attribute his failure to a breach of\r\nchastity on the part of his men. It should be remarked that the\r\nconduct thus prescribed as a preparation for whaling is precisely\r\nthat which in the same tribe of Indians was required of men about to\r\ngo on the war-path. Rules of the same sort are, or were formerly,\r\nobserved by Malagasy whalers. For eight days before they went to sea\r\nthe crew of a whaler used to fast, abstaining from women and liquor,\r\nand confessing their most secret faults to each other; and if any\r\nman was found to have sinned deeply, he was forbidden to share in\r\nthe expedition. In the island of Mabuiag continence was imposed on\r\nthe people both before they went to hunt the dugong and while the\r\nturtles were pairing. The turtle-season lasts during parts of\r\nOctober and November; and if at that time unmarried persons had\r\nsexual intercourse with each other, it was believed that when the\r\ncanoe approached the floating turtle, the male would separate from\r\nthe female and both would dive down in different directions. So at\r\nMowat in New Guinea men have no relation with women when the turtles\r\nare coupling, though there is considerable laxity of morals at other\r\ntimes. In the island of Uap, one of the Caroline group, every\r\nfisherman plying his craft lies under a most strict taboo during the\r\nwhole of the fishing season, which lasts for six or eight weeks.\r\nWhenever he is on shore he must spend all his time in the men\'s\r\nclubhouse, and under no pretext whatever may he visit his own house\r\nor so much as look upon the faces of his wife and womenkind. Were he\r\nbut to steal a glance at them, they think that flying fish must\r\ninevitably bore out his eyes at night. If his wife, mother, or\r\ndaughter brings any gift for him or wishes to talk with him, she\r\nmust stand down towards the shore with her back turned to the men\'s\r\nclubhouse. Then the fisherman may go out and speak to her, or with\r\nhis back turned to her he may receive what she has brought him;\r\nafter which he must return at once to his rigorous confinement.\r\nIndeed the fishermen may not even join in dance and song with the\r\nother men of the clubhouse in the evening; they must keep to\r\nthemselves and be silent. In Mirzapur, when the seed of the silkworm\r\nis brought into the house, the Kol or Bhuiyar puts it in a place\r\nwhich has been carefully plastered with holy cowdung to bring good\r\nluck. From that time the owner must be careful to avoid ceremonial\r\nimpurity. He must give up cohabitation with his wife; he may not\r\nsleep on a bed, nor shave himself, nor cut his nails, nor anoint\r\nhimself with oil, nor eat food cooked with butter, nor tell lies,\r\nnor do anything else that he deems wrong. He vows to Singarmati Devi\r\nthat, if the worms are duly born, he will make her an offering. When\r\nthe cocoons open and the worms appear, he assembles the women of the\r\nhouse and they sing the same song as at the birth of a baby, and red\r\nlead is smeared on the parting of the hair of all the married women\r\nof the neighbourhood. When the worms pair, rejoicings are made as at\r\na marriage. Thus the silkworms are treated as far as possible like\r\nhuman beings. Hence the custom which prohibits the commerce of the\r\nsexes while the worms are hatching may be only an extension, by\r\nanalogy, of the rule which is observed by many races, that the\r\nhusband may not cohabit with his wife during pregnancy and\r\nlactation.\r\n\r\nIn the island of Nias the hunters sometimes dig pits, cover them\r\nlightly over with twigs, grass, and leaves, and then drive the game\r\ninto them. While they are engaged in digging the pits, they have to\r\nobserve a number of taboos. They may not spit, or the game would\r\nturn back in disgust from the pits. They may not laugh, or the sides\r\nof the pit would fall in. They may eat no salt, prepare no fodder\r\nfor swine, and in the pit they may not scratch themselves, for if\r\nthey did, the earth would be loosened and would collapse. And the\r\nnight after digging the pit they may have no intercourse with a\r\nwoman, or all their labour would be in vain.\r\n\r\nThis practice of observing strict chastity as a condition of success\r\nin hunting and fishing is very common among rude races; and the\r\ninstances of it which have been cited render it probable that the\r\nrule is always based on a superstition rather than on a\r\nconsideration of the temporary weakness which a breach of the custom\r\nmay entail on the hunter or fisherman. In general it appears to be\r\nsupposed that the evil effect of incontinence is not so much that it\r\nweakens him, as that, for some reason or other, it offends the\r\nanimals, who in consequence will not suffer themselves to be caught.\r\nA Carrier Indian of British Columbia used to separate from his wife\r\nfor a full month before he set traps for bears, and during this time\r\nhe might not drink from the same vessel as his wife, but had to use\r\na special cup made of birch bark. The neglect of these precautions\r\nwould cause the game to escape after it had been snared. But when he\r\nwas about to snare martens, the period of continence was cut down to\r\nten days.\r\n\r\nAn examination of all the many cases in which the savage bridles his\r\npassions and remains chaste from motives of superstition, would be\r\ninstructive, but I cannot attempt it now. I will only add a few\r\nmiscellaneous examples of the custom before passing to the\r\nceremonies of purification which are observed by the hunter and\r\nfisherman after the chase and the fishing are over. The workers in\r\nthe salt-pans near Siphoum, in Laos, must abstain from all sexual\r\nrelations at the place where they are at work; and they may not\r\ncover their heads nor shelter themselves under an umbrella from the\r\nburning rays of the sun. Among the Kachins of Burma the ferment used\r\nin making beer is prepared by two women, chosen by lot, who during\r\nthe three days that the process lasts may eat nothing acid and may\r\nhave no conjugal relations with their husbands; otherwise it is\r\nsupposed that the beer would be sour. Among the Masai honey-wine is\r\nbrewed by a man and a woman who live in a hut set apart for them\r\ntill the wine is ready for drinking. But they are strictly forbidden\r\nto have sexual intercourse with each other during this time; it is\r\ndeemed essential that they should be chaste for two days before they\r\nbegin to brew and for the whole of the six days that the brewing\r\nlasts. The Masai believe that were the couple to commit a breach of\r\nchastity, not only would the wine be undrinkable but the bees which\r\nmade the honey would fly away. Similarly they require that a man who\r\nis making poison should sleep alone and observe other taboos which\r\nrender him almost an outcast. The Wandorobbo, a tribe of the same\r\nregion as the Masai, believe that the mere presence of a woman in\r\nthe neighbourhood of a man who is brewing poison would deprive the\r\npoison of its venom, and that the same thing would happen if the\r\nwife of the poison-maker were to commit adultery while her husband\r\nwas brewing the poison. In this last case it is obvious that a\r\nrationalistic explanation of the taboo is impossible. How could the\r\nloss of virtue in the poison be a physical consequence of the loss\r\nof virtue in the poison-maker\'s wife? Clearly the effect which the\r\nwife\'s adultery is supposed to have on the poison is a case of\r\nsympathetic magic; her misconduct sympathetically affects her\r\nhusband and his work at a distance. We may, accordingly, infer with\r\nsome confidence that the rule of continence imposed on the\r\npoison-maker himself is also a simple case of sympathetic magic, and\r\nnot, as a civilised reader might be disposed to conjecture, a wise\r\nprecaution designed to prevent him from accidentally poisoning his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nAmong the Ba-Pedi and Ba-Thonga tribes of South Africa, when the\r\nsite of a new village has been chosen and the houses are building,\r\nall the married people are forbidden to have conjugal relations with\r\neach other. If it were discovered that any couple had broken this\r\nrule, the work of building would immediately be stopped, and another\r\nsite chosen for the village. For they think that a breach of\r\nchastity would spoil the village which was growing up, that the\r\nchief would grow lean and perhaps die, and that the guilty woman\r\nwould never bear another child. Among the Chams of Cochin-China,\r\nwhen a dam is made or repaired on a river for the sake of\r\nirrigation, the chief who offers the traditional sacrifices and\r\nimplores the protection of the deities on the work has to stay all\r\nthe time in a wretched hovel of straw, taking no part in the labour,\r\nand observing the strictest continence; for the people believe that\r\na breach of his chastity would entail a breach of the dam. Here, it\r\nis plain, there can be no idea of maintaining the mere bodily vigour\r\nof the chief for the accomplishment of a task in which he does not\r\neven bear a hand.\r\n\r\nIf the taboos or abstinences observed by hunters and fishermen\r\nbefore and during the chase are dictated, as we have seen reason to\r\nbelieve, by superstitious motives, and chiefly by a dread of\r\noffending or frightening the spirits of the creatures whom it is\r\nproposed to kill, we may expect that the restraints imposed after\r\nthe slaughter has been perpetrated will be at least as stringent,\r\nthe slayer and his friends having now the added fear of the angry\r\nghosts of his victims before their eyes. Whereas on the hypothesis\r\nthat the abstinences in question, including those from food, drink,\r\nand sleep, are merely salutary precautions for maintaining the men\r\nin health and strength to do their work, it is obvious that the\r\nobservance of these abstinences or taboos after the work is done,\r\nthat is, when the game is killed and the fish caught, must be wholly\r\nsuperfluous, absurd, and inexplicable. But as I shall now show,\r\nthese taboos often continue to be enforced or even increased in\r\nstringency after the death of the animals, in other words, after the\r\nhunter or fisher has accomplished his object by making his bag or\r\nlanding his fish. The rationalistic theory of them therefore breaks\r\ndown entirely; the hypothesis of superstition is clearly the only\r\none open to us.\r\n\r\nAmong the Inuit or Esquimaux of Bering Strait "the dead bodies of\r\nvarious animals must be treated very carefully by the hunter who\r\nobtains them, so that their shades may not be offended and bring bad\r\nluck or even death upon him or his people." Hence the Unalit hunter\r\nwho has had a hand in the killing of a white whale, or even has\r\nhelped to take one from the net, is not allowed to do any work for\r\nthe next four days, that being the time during which the shade or\r\nghost of the whale is supposed to stay with its body. At the same\r\ntime no one in the village may use any sharp or pointed instrument\r\nfor fear of wounding the whale\'s shade, which is believed to be\r\nhovering invisible in the neighbourhood; and no loud noise may be\r\nmade lest it should frighten or offend the ghost. Whoever cuts a\r\nwhale\'s body with an iron axe will die. Indeed the use of all iron\r\ninstruments is forbidden in the village during these four days.\r\n\r\nThese same Esquimaux celebrate a great annual festival in December\r\nwhen the bladders of all the seals, whales, walrus, and white bears\r\nthat have been killed in the year are taken into the assembly-house\r\nof the village. They remain there for several days, and so long as\r\nthey do so the hunters avoid all intercourse with women, saying that\r\nif they failed in that respect the shades of the dead animals would\r\nbe offended. Similarly among the Aleuts of Alaska the hunter who had\r\nstruck a whale with a charmed spear would not throw again, but\r\nreturned at once to his home and separated himself from his people\r\nin a hut specially constructed for the purpose, where he stayed for\r\nthree days without food or drink, and without touching or looking\r\nupon a woman. During this time of seclusion he snorted occasionally\r\nin imitation of the wounded and dying whale, in order to prevent the\r\nwhale which he had struck from leaving the coast. On the fourth day\r\nhe emerged from his seclusion and bathed in the sea, shrieking in a\r\nhoarse voice and beating the water with his hands. Then, taking with\r\nhim a companion, he repaired to that part of the shore where he\r\nexpected to find the whale stranded. If the beast was dead, he at\r\nonce cut out the place where the death-wound had been inflicted. If\r\nthe whale was not dead, he again returned to his home and continued\r\nwashing himself until the whale died. Here the hunter\'s imitation of\r\nthe wounded whale is probably intended by means of homoeopathic\r\nmagic to make the beast die in earnest. Once more the soul of the\r\ngrim polar bear is offended if the taboos which concern him are not\r\nobserved. His soul tarries for three days near the spot where it\r\nleft his body, and during these days the Esquimaux are particularly\r\ncareful to conform rigidly to the laws of taboo, because they\r\nbelieve that punishment overtakes the transgressor who sins against\r\nthe soul of a bear far more speedily than him who sins against the\r\nsouls of the sea-beasts.\r\n\r\nWhen the Kayans have shot one of the dreaded Bornean panthers, they\r\nare very anxious about the safety of their souls, for they think\r\nthat the soul of a panther is almost more powerful than their own.\r\nHence they step eight times over the carcase of the dead beast\r\nreciting the spell, "Panther, thy soul under my soul." On returning\r\nhome they smear themselves, their dogs, and their weapons with the\r\nblood of fowls in order to calm their souls and hinder them from\r\nfleeing away; for, being themselves fond of the flesh of fowls, they\r\nascribe the same taste to their souls. For eight days afterwards\r\nthey must bathe by day and by night before going out again to the\r\nchase. Among the Hottentots, when a man has killed a lion, leopard,\r\nelephant, or rhinoceros, he is esteemed a great hero, but he has to\r\nremain at home quite idle for three days, during which his wife may\r\nnot come near him; she is also enjoined to restrict herself to a\r\npoor diet and to eat no more than is barely necessary to keep her in\r\nhealth. Similarly the Lapps deem it the height of glory to kill a\r\nbear, which they consider the king of beasts. Nevertheless, all the\r\nmen who take part in the slaughter are regarded as unclean, and must\r\nlive by themselves for three days in a hut or tent made specially\r\nfor them, where they cut up and cook the bear\'s carcase. The\r\nreindeer which brought in the carcase on a sledge may not be driven\r\nby a woman for a whole year; indeed, according to one account, it\r\nmay not be used by anybody for that period. Before the men go into\r\nthe tent where they are to be secluded, they strip themselves of the\r\ngarments they had worn in killing the bear, and their wives spit the\r\nred juice of alder bark in their faces. They enter the tent not by\r\nthe ordinary door but by an opening at the back. When the bear\'s\r\nflesh has been cooked, a portion of it is sent by the hands of two\r\nmen to the women, who may not approach the men\'s tent while the\r\ncooking is going on. The men who convey the flesh to the women\r\npretend to be strangers bringing presents from a foreign land; the\r\nwomen keep up the pretence and promise to tie red threads round the\r\nlegs of the strangers. The bear\'s flesh may not be passed in to the\r\nwomen through the door of their tent, but must be thrust in at a\r\nspecial opening made by lifting up the hem of the tent-cover. When\r\nthe three days\' seclusion is over and the men are at liberty to\r\nreturn to their wives, they run, one after the other, round the\r\nfire, holding the chain by which pots are suspended over it. This is\r\nregarded as a form of purification; they may now leave the tent by\r\nthe ordinary door and rejoin the women. But the leader of the party\r\nmust still abstain from cohabitation with his wife for two days\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Caffres are said to dread greatly the boa-constrictor or\r\nan enormous serpent resembling it; "and being influenced by certain\r\nsuperstitious notions they even fear to kill it. The man who\r\nhappened to put it to death, whether in self-defence or otherwise,\r\nwas formerly required to lie in a running stream of water during the\r\nday for several weeks together; and no beast whatever was allowed to\r\nbe slaughtered at the hamlet to which he belonged, until this duty\r\nhad been fully performed. The body of the snake was then taken and\r\ncarefully buried in a trench, dug close to the cattle-fold, where\r\nits remains, like those of a chief, were henceforward kept perfectly\r\nundisturbed. The period of penance, as in the case of mourning for\r\nthe dead, is now happily reduced to a few days." In Madras it is\r\nconsidered a great sin to kill a cobra. When this has happened, the\r\npeople generally burn the body of the serpent, just as they burn the\r\nbodies of human beings. The murderer deems himself polluted for\r\nthree days. On the second day milk is poured on the remains of the\r\ncobra. On the third day the guilty wretch is free from pollution.\r\n\r\nIn these last cases the animal whose slaughter has to be atoned for\r\nis sacred, that is, it is one whose life is commonly spared from\r\nmotives of superstition. Yet the treatment of the sacrilegious\r\nslayer seems to resemble so closely the treatment of hunters and\r\nfishermen who have killed animals for food in the ordinary course of\r\nbusiness, that the ideas on which both sets of customs are based may\r\nbe assumed to be substantially the same. Those ideas, if I am right,\r\nare the respect which the savage feels for the souls of beasts,\r\nespecially valuable or formidable beasts, and the dread which he\r\nentertains of their vengeful ghosts. Some confirmation of this view\r\nmay be drawn from the ceremonies observed by fishermen of Annam when\r\nthe carcase of a whale is washed ashore. These fisherfolk, we are\r\ntold, worship the whale on account of the benefits they derive from\r\nit. There is hardly a village on the sea-shore which has not its\r\nsmall pagoda, containing the bones, more or less authentic, of a\r\nwhale. When a dead whale is washed ashore, the people accord it a\r\nsolemn burial. The man who first caught sight of it acts as chief\r\nmourner, performing the rites which as chief mourner and heir he\r\nwould perform for a human kinsman. He puts on all the garb of woe,\r\nthe straw hat, the white robe with long sleeves turned inside out,\r\nand the other paraphernalia of full mourning. As next of kin to the\r\ndeceased he presides over the funeral rites. Perfumes are burned,\r\nsticks of incense kindled, leaves of gold and silver scattered,\r\ncrackers let off. When the flesh has been cut off and the oil\r\nextracted, the remains of the carcase are buried in the sand. After\r\nwards a shed is set up and offerings are made in it. Usually some\r\ntime after the burial the spirit of the dead whale takes possession\r\nof some person in the village and declares by his mouth whether he\r\nis a male or a female.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI. Tabooed Things\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Meaning of Taboo\r\n\r\nTHUS in primitive society the rules of ceremonial purity observed by\r\ndivine kings, chiefs, and priests agree in many respects with the\r\nrules observed by homicides, mourners, women in childbed, girls at\r\npuberty, hunters and fishermen, and so on. To us these various\r\nclasses of persons appear to differ totally in character and\r\ncondition; some of them we should call holy, others we might\r\npronounce unclean and polluted. But the savage makes no such moral\r\ndistinction between them; the conceptions of holiness and pollution\r\nare not yet differentiated in his mind. To him the common feature of\r\nall these persons is that they are dangerous and in danger, and the\r\ndanger in which they stand and to which they expose others is what\r\nwe should call spiritual or ghostly, and therefore imaginary. The\r\ndanger, however, is not less real because it is imaginary;\r\nimagination acts upon man as really as does gravitation, and may\r\nkill him as certainly as a dose of prussic acid. To seclude these\r\npersons from the rest of the world so that the dreaded spiritual\r\ndanger shall neither reach them nor spread from them, is the object\r\nof the taboos which they have to observe. These taboos act, so to\r\nsay, as electrical insulators to preserve the spiritual force with\r\nwhich these persons are charged from suffering or inflicting harm by\r\ncontact with the outer world.\r\n\r\nTo the illustrations of these general principles which have been\r\nalready given I shall now add some more, drawing my examples, first,\r\nfrom the class of tabooed things, and, second, from the class of\r\ntabooed words; for in the opinion of the savage both things and\r\nwords may, like persons, be charged or electrified, either\r\ntemporarily or permanently, with the mysterious virtue of taboo, and\r\nmay therefore require to be banished for a longer or shorter time\r\nfrom the familiar usage of common life. And the examples will be\r\nchosen with special reference to those sacred chiefs, kings and\r\npriests, who, more than anybody else, live fenced about by taboo as\r\nby a wall. Tabooed things will be illustrated in the present\r\nchapter, and tabooed words in the next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Iron tabooed\r\n\r\nIN THE FIRST place we may observe that the awful sanctity of kings\r\nnaturally leads to a prohibition to touch their sacred persons. Thus\r\nit was unlawful to lay hands on the person of a Spartan king: no one\r\nmight touch the body of the king or queen of Tahiti: it is forbidden\r\nto touch the person of the king of Siam under pain of death; and no\r\none may touch the king of Cambodia, for any purpose whatever,\r\nwithout his express command. In July 1874 the king was thrown from\r\nhis carriage and lay insensible on the ground, but not one of his\r\nsuite dared to touch him; a European coming to the spot carried the\r\ninjured monarch to his palace. Formerly no one might touch the king\r\nof Corea; and if he deigned to touch a subject, the spot touched\r\nbecame sacred, and the person thus honoured had to wear a visible\r\nmark (generally a cord of red silk) for the rest of his life. Above\r\nall, no iron might touch the king\'s body. In 1800 King\r\nTieng-tsong-tai-oang died of a tumour in the back, no one dreaming\r\nof employing the lancet, which would probably have saved his life.\r\nIt is said that one king suffered terribly from an abscess in the\r\nlip, till his physician called in a jester, whose pranks made the\r\nking laugh heartily, and so the abscess burst. Roman and Sabine\r\npriests might not be shaved with iron but only with bronze razors or\r\nshears; and whenever an iron graving-tool was brought into the\r\nsacred grove of the Arval Brothers at Rome for the purpose of\r\ncutting an inscription in stone, an expiatory sacrifice of a lamb\r\nand a pig must be offered, which was repeated when the graving-tool\r\nwas removed from the grove. As a general rule iron might not be\r\nbrought into Greek sanctuaries. In Crete sacrifices were offered to\r\nMenedemus without the use of iron, because the legend ran that\r\nMenedemus had been killed by an iron weapon in the Trojan war. The\r\nArchon of Plataea might not touch iron; but once a year, at the\r\nannual commemoration of the men who fell at the battle of Plataea,\r\nhe was allowed to carry a sword wherewith to sacrifice a bull. To\r\nthis day a Hottentot priest never uses an iron knife, but always a\r\nsharp splint of quartz, in sacrificing an animal or circumcising a\r\nlad. Among the Ovambo of South-west Africa custom requires that lads\r\nshould be circumcised with a sharp flint; if none is to hand, the\r\noperation may be performed with iron, but the iron must afterwards\r\nbe buried. Amongst the Moquis of Arizona stone knives, hatchets, and\r\nso on have passed out of common use, but are retained in religious\r\nceremonies. After the Pawnees had ceased to use stone arrow-heads\r\nfor ordinary purposes, they still employed them to slay the\r\nsacrifices, whether human captives or buffalo and deer. Amongst the\r\nJews no iron tool was used in building the Temple at Jerusalem or in\r\nmaking an altar. The old wooden bridge (_Pons Sublicius_) at Rome,\r\nwhich was considered sacred, was made and had to be kept in repair\r\nwithout the use of iron or bronze. It was expressly provided by law\r\nthat the temple of Jupiter Liber at Furfo might be repaired with\r\niron tools. The council chamber at Cyzicus was constructed of wood\r\nwithout any iron nails, the beams being so arranged that they could\r\nbe taken out and replaced.\r\n\r\nThis superstitious objection to iron perhaps dates from that early\r\ntime in the history of society when iron was still a novelty, and as\r\nsuch was viewed by many with suspicion and dislike. For everything\r\nnew is apt to excite the awe and dread of the savage. "It is a\r\ncurious superstition," says a pioneer in Borneo, "this of the\r\nDusuns, to attribute anything--whether good or bad, lucky or\r\nunlucky--that happens to them to something novel which has arrived\r\nin their country. For instance, my living in Kindram has caused the\r\nintensely hot weather we have experienced of late." The unusually\r\nheavy rains which happened to follow the English survey of the\r\nNicobar Islands in the winter of 1886-1887 were imputed by the\r\nalarmed natives to the wrath of the spirits at the theodolites,\r\ndumpy-levellers, and other strange instruments which had been set up\r\nin so many of their favourite haunts; and some of them proposed to\r\nsoothe the anger of the spirits by sacrificing a pig. In the\r\nseventeenth century a succession of bad seasons excited a revolt\r\namong the Esthonian peasantry, who traced the origin of the evil to\r\na watermill, which put a stream to some inconvenience by checking\r\nits flow. The first introduction of iron ploughshares into Poland\r\nhaving been followed by a succession of bad harvests, the farmers\r\nattributed the badness of the crops to the iron ploughshares, and\r\ndiscarded them for the old wooden ones. To this day the primitive\r\nBaduwis of Java, who live chiefly by husbandry, will use no iron\r\ntools in tilling their fields.\r\n\r\nThe general dislike of innovation, which always makes itself\r\nstrongly felt in the sphere of religion, is sufficient by itself to\r\naccount for the superstitious aversion to iron entertained by kings\r\nand priests and attributed by them to the gods; possibly this\r\naversion may have been intensified in places by some such accidental\r\ncause as the series of bad seasons which cast discredit on iron\r\nploughshares in Poland. But the disfavour in which iron is held by\r\nthe gods and their ministers has another side. Their antipathy to\r\nthe metal furnishes men with a weapon which may be turned against\r\nthe spirits when occasion serves. As their dislike of iron is\r\nsupposed to be so great that they will not approach persons and\r\nthings protected by the obnoxious metal, iron may obviously be\r\nemployed as a charm for banning ghosts and other dangerous spirits.\r\nAnd often it is so used. Thus in the Highlands of Scotland the great\r\nsafeguard against the elfin race is iron, or, better yet, steel. The\r\nmetal in any form, whether as a sword, a knife, a gun-barrel, or\r\nwhat not, is all-powerful for this purpose. Whenever you enter a\r\nfairy dwelling you should always remember to stick a piece of steel,\r\nsuch as a knife, a needle, or a fish-hook, in the door; for then the\r\nelves will not be able to shut the door till you come out again. So,\r\ntoo, when you have shot a deer and are bringing it home at night, be\r\nsure to thrust a knife into the carcase, for that keeps the fairies\r\nfrom laying their weight on it. A knife or nail in your pocket is\r\nquite enough to prevent the fairies from lifting you up at night.\r\nNails in the front of a bed ward off elves from women "in the straw"\r\nand from their babes; but to make quite sure it is better to put the\r\nsmoothing-iron under the bed, and the reaping-hook in the window. If\r\na bull has fallen over a rock and been killed, a nail stuck into it\r\nwill preserve the flesh from the fairies. Music discoursed on a\r\nJew\'s harp keeps the elfin women away from the hunter, because the\r\ntongue of the instrument is of steel. In Morocco iron is considered\r\na great protection against demons; hence it is usual to place a\r\nknife or dagger under a sick man\'s pillow. The Singhalese believe\r\nthat they are constantly surrounded by evil spirits, who lie in wait\r\nto do them harm. A peasant would not dare to carry good food, such\r\nas cakes or roast meat, from one place to another without putting an\r\niron nail on it to prevent a demon from taking possession of the\r\nviands and so making the eater ill. No sick person, whether man or\r\nwoman, would venture out of the house without a bunch of keys or a\r\nknife in his hand, for without such a talisman he would fear that\r\nsome devil might take advantage of his weak state to slip into his\r\nbody. And if a man has a large sore on his body he tries to keep a\r\nmorsel of iron on it as a protection against demons. On the Slave\r\nCoast when a mother sees her child gradually wasting away, she\r\nconcludes that a demon has entered into the child, and takes her\r\nmeasures accordingly. To lure the demon out of the body of her\r\noffspring, she offers a sacrifice of food; and while the devil is\r\nbolting it, she attaches iron rings and small bells to her child\'s\r\nankles and hangs iron chains round his neck. The jingling of the\r\niron and the tinkling of the bells are supposed to prevent the\r\ndemon, when he has concluded his repast, from entering again into\r\nthe body of the little sufferer. Hence many children may be seen in\r\nthis part of Africa weighed down with iron ornaments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Sharp Weapons tabooed\r\n\r\nTHERE is a priestly king to the north of Zengwih in Burma, revered\r\nby the Sotih as the highest spiritual and temporal authority, into\r\nwhose house no weapon or cutting instrument may be brought. This\r\nrule may perhaps be explained by a custom observed by various\r\npeoples after a death; they refrain from the use of sharp\r\ninstruments so long as the ghost of the deceased is supposed to be\r\nnear, lest they should wound it. Thus among the Esquimaux of Bering\r\nStrait "during the day on which a person dies in the village no one\r\nis permitted to work, and the relatives must perform no labour\r\nduring the three following days. It is especially forbidden during\r\nthis period to cut with any edged instrument, such as a knife or an\r\naxe; and the use of pointed instruments, like needles or bodkins, is\r\nalso forbidden. This is said to be done to avoid cutting or injuring\r\nthe shade, which may be present at any time during this period, and,\r\nif accidentally injured by any of these things, it would become very\r\nangry and bring sickness or death to the people. The relatives must\r\nalso be very careful at this time not to make any loud or harsh\r\nnoises that may startle or anger the shade." We have seen that in\r\nlike manner after killing a white whale these Esquimaux abstain from\r\nthe use of cutting or pointed instruments for four days, lest they\r\nshould unwittingly cut or stab the whale\'s ghost. The same taboo is\r\nsometimes observed by them when there is a sick person in the\r\nvillage, probably from a fear of injuring his shade which may be\r\nhovering outside of his body. After a death the Roumanians of\r\nTransylvania are careful not to leave a knife lying with the sharp\r\nedge uppermost so long as the corpse remains in the house, "or else\r\nthe soul will be forced to ride on the blade." For seven days after\r\na death, the corpse being still in the house, the Chinese abstain\r\nfrom the use of knives and needles, and even of chopsticks, eating\r\ntheir food with their fingers. On the third, sixth, ninth, and\r\nfortieth days after the funeral the old Prussians and Lithuanians\r\nused to prepare a meal, to which, standing at the door, they invited\r\nthe soul of the deceased. At these meals they sat silent round the\r\ntable and used no knives and the women who served up the food were\r\nalso without knives. If any morsels fell from the table they were\r\nleft lying there for the lonely souls that had no living relations\r\nor friends to feed them. When the meal was over the priest took a\r\nbroom and swept the souls out of the house, saying, "Dear souls, ye\r\nhave eaten and drunk. Go forth, go forth." We can now understand why\r\nno cutting instrument may be taken into the house of the Burmese\r\npontiff. Like so many priestly kings, he is probably regarded as\r\ndivine, and it is therefore right that his sacred spirit should not\r\nbe exposed to the risk of being cut or wounded whenever it quits his\r\nbody to hover invisible in the air or to fly on some distant\r\nmission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Blood tabooed\r\n\r\nWE have seen that the Flamen Dialis was forbidden to touch or even\r\nname raw flesh. At certain times a Brahman teacher is enjoined not\r\nto look on raw flesh, blood, or persons whose hands have been cut\r\noff. In Uganda the father of twins is in a state of taboo for some\r\ntime after birth; among other rules he is forbidden to kill anything\r\nor to see blood. In the Pelew Islands when a raid has been made on a\r\nvillage and a head carried off, the relations of the slain man are\r\ntabooed and have to submit to certain observances in order to escape\r\nthe wrath of his ghost. They are shut up in the house, touch no raw\r\nflesh, and chew betel over which an incantation has been uttered by\r\nthe exorcist. After this the ghost of the slaughtered man goes away\r\nto the enemy\'s country in pursuit of his murderer. The taboo is\r\nprobably based on the common belief that the soul or spirit of the\r\nanimal is in the blood. As tabooed persons are believed to be in a\r\nperilous state--for example, the relations of the slain man are\r\nliable to the attacks of his indignant ghost--it is especially\r\nnecessary to isolate them from contact with spirits; hence the\r\nprohibition to touch raw meat. But as usual the taboo is only the\r\nspecial enforcement of a general precept; in other words, its\r\nobservance is particularly enjoined in circumstances which seem\r\nurgently to call for its application, but apart from such\r\ncircumstances the prohibition is also observed, though less\r\nstrictly, as a common rule of life. Thus some of the Esthonians will\r\nnot taste blood because they believe that it contains the animal\'s\r\nsoul, which would enter the body of the person who tasted the blood.\r\nSome Indian tribes of North America, "through a strong principle of\r\nreligion, abstain in the strictest manner from eating the blood of\r\nany animal, as it contains the life and spirit of the beast." Jewish\r\nhunters poured out the blood of the game they had killed and covered\r\nit up with dust. They would not taste the blood, believing that the\r\nsoul or life of the animal was in the blood, or actually was the\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nIt is a common rule that royal blood may not be shed upon the\r\nground. Hence when a king or one of his family is to be put to death\r\na mode of execution is devised by which the royal blood shall not be\r\nspilt upon the earth. About the year 1688 the generalissimo of the\r\narmy rebelled against the king of Siam and put him to death "after\r\nthe manner of royal criminals, or as princes of the blood are\r\ntreated when convicted of capital crimes, which is by putting them\r\ninto a large iron caldron, and pounding them to pieces with wooden\r\npestles, because none of their royal blood must be spilt on the\r\nground, it being, by their religion, thought great impiety to\r\ncontaminate the divine blood by mixing it with earth." When Kublai\r\nKhan defeated and took his uncle Nayan, who had rebelled against\r\nhim, he caused Nayan to be put to death by being wrapt in a carpet\r\nand tossed to and fro till he died, "because he would not have the\r\nblood of his Line Imperial spilt upon the ground or exposed in the\r\neye of Heaven and before the Sun." "Friar Ricold mentions the Tartar\r\nmaxim: \'One Khan will put another to death to get possession of the\r\nthrone, but he takes great care that the blood be not spilt. For\r\nthey say that it is highly improper that the blood of the Great Khan\r\nshould be spilt upon the ground; so they cause the victim to be\r\nsmothered somehow or other.\' The like feeling prevails at the court\r\nof Burma, where a peculiar mode of execution without bloodshed is\r\nreserved for princes of the blood."\r\n\r\nThe reluctance to spill royal blood seems to be only a particular\r\ncase of a general unwillingness to shed blood or at least to allow\r\nit to fall on the ground. Marco Polo tells us that in his day\r\npersons caught in the streets of Cambaluc (Peking) at unseasonable\r\nhours were arrested, and if found guilty of a misdemeanor were\r\nbeaten with a stick. "Under this punishment people sometimes die,\r\nbut they adopt it in order to eschew bloodshed, for their _Bacsis_\r\nsay that it is an evil thing to shed man\'s blood." In West Sussex\r\npeople believe that the ground on which human blood has been shed is\r\naccursed and will remain barren for ever. Among some primitive\r\npeoples, when the blood of a tribesman has to be spilt it is not\r\nsuffered to fall upon the ground, but is received upon the bodies of\r\nhis fellow-tribesmen. Thus in some Australian tribes boys who are\r\nbeing circumcised are laid on a platform, formed by the living\r\nbodies of the tribesmen; and when a boy\'s tooth is knocked out as an\r\ninitiatory ceremony, he is seated on the shoulders of a man, on\r\nwhose breast the blood flows and may not be wiped away. "Also the\r\nGauls used to drink their enemies\' blood and paint themselves\r\ntherewith. So also they write that the old Irish were wont; and so\r\nhave I seen some of the Irish do, but not their enemies\' but\r\nfriends\' blood, as, namely, at the execution of a notable traitor at\r\nLimerick, called Murrogh O\'Brien, I saw an old woman, which was his\r\nfoster-mother, take up his head whilst he was quartered and suck up\r\nall the blood that ran thereout, saying that the earth was not\r\nworthy to drink it, and therewith also steeped her face and breast\r\nand tore her hair, crying out and shrieking most terribly." Among\r\nthe Latuka of Central Africa the earth on which a drop of blood has\r\nfallen at childbirth is carefully scraped up with an iron shovel,\r\nput into a pot along with the water used in washing the mother, and\r\nburied tolerably deep outside the house on the left-hand side. In\r\nWest Africa, if a drop of your blood has fallen on the ground, you\r\nmust carefully cover it up, rub and stamp it into the soil; if it\r\nhas fallen on the side of a canoe or a tree, the place is cut out\r\nand the chip destroyed. One motive of these African customs may be a\r\nwish to prevent the blood from falling into the hands of magicians,\r\nwho might make an evil use of it. That is admittedly the reason why\r\npeople in West Africa stamp out any blood of theirs which has\r\ndropped on the ground or cut out any wood that has been soaked with\r\nit. From a like dread of sorcery natives of New Guinea are careful\r\nto burn any sticks, leaves, or rags which are stained with their\r\nblood; and if the blood has dripped on the ground they turn up the\r\nsoil and if possible light a fire on the spot. The same fear\r\nexplains the curious duties discharged by a class of men called\r\n_ramanga_ or "blue blood" among the Betsileo of Madagascar. It is\r\ntheir business to eat all the nail-parings and to lick up all the\r\nspilt blood of the nobles. When the nobles pare their nails, the\r\nparings are collected to the last scrap and swallowed by these\r\n_ramanga._ If the parings are too large, they are minced small and\r\nso gulped down. Again, should a nobleman wound himself, say in\r\ncutting his nails or treading on something, the _ramanga_ lick up\r\nthe blood as fast as possible. Nobles of high rank hardly go\r\nanywhere without these humble attendants; but if it should happen\r\nthat there are none of them present, the cut nails and the spilt\r\nblood are carefully collected to be afterwards swallowed by the\r\n_ramanga._ There is scarcely a nobleman of any pretensions who does\r\nnot strictly observe this custom, the intention of which probably is\r\nto prevent these parts of his person from falling into the hands of\r\nsorcerers, who on the principles of contagious magic could work him\r\nharm thereby.\r\n\r\nThe general explanation of the reluctance to shed blood on the\r\nground is probably to be found in the belief that the soul is in the\r\nblood, and that therefore any ground on which it may fall\r\nnecessarily becomes taboo or sacred. In New Zealand anything upon\r\nwhich even a drop of a high chief\'s blood chances to fall becomes\r\ntaboo or sacred to him. For instance, a party of natives having come\r\nto visit a chief in a fine new canoe, the chief got into it, but in\r\ndoing so a splinter entered his foot, and the blood trickled on the\r\ncanoe, which at once became sacred to him. The owner jumped out,\r\ndragged the canoe ashore opposite the chief\'s house, and left it\r\nthere. Again, a chief in entering a missionary\'s house knocked his\r\nhead against a beam, and the blood flowed. The natives said that in\r\nformer times the house would have belonged to the chief. As usually\r\nhappens with taboos of universal application, the prohibition to\r\nspill the blood of a tribesman on the ground applies with peculiar\r\nstringency to chiefs and kings, and is observed in their case long\r\nafter it has ceased to be observed in the case of others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The Head tabooed\r\n\r\nMANY peoples regard the head as peculiarly sacred; the special\r\nsanctity attributed to it is sometimes explained by a belief that it\r\ncontains a spirit which is very sensitive to injury or disrespect.\r\nThus the Yorubas hold that every man has three spiritual inmates, of\r\nwhom the first, called Olori, dwells in the head and is the man\'s\r\nprotector, guardian, and guide. Offerings are made to this spirit,\r\nchiefly of fowls, and some of the blood mixed with palmoil is rubbed\r\non the forehead. The Karens suppose that a being called the _tso_\r\nresides in the upper part of the head, and while it retains its seat\r\nno harm can befall the person from the efforts of the seven\r\n_Kelahs,_ or personified passions. "But if the _tso_ becomes\r\nheedless or weak certain evil to the person is the result. Hence the\r\nhead is carefully attended to, and all possible pains are taken to\r\nprovide such dress and attire as will be pleasing to the _tso._" The\r\nSiamese think that a spirit called _khuan_ or _kwun_ dwells in the\r\nhuman head, of which it is the guardian spirit. The spirit must be\r\ncarefully protected from injury of every kind; hence the act of\r\nshaving or cutting the hair is accompanied with many ceremonies. The\r\n_kwun_ is very sensitive on points of honour, and would feel\r\nmortally insulted if the head in which he resides were touched by\r\nthe hand of a stranger. The Cambodians esteem it a grave offence to\r\ntouch a man\'s head; some of them will not enter a place where\r\nanything whatever is suspended over their heads; and the meanest\r\nCambodian would never consent to live under an inhabited room. Hence\r\nthe houses are built of one story only; and even the Government\r\nrespects the prejudice by never placing a prisoner in the stocks\r\nunder the floor of a house, though the houses are raised high above\r\nthe ground. The same superstition exists amongst the Malays; for an\r\nearly traveller reports that in Java people "wear nothing on their\r\nheads, and say that nothing must be on their heads . . . and if any\r\nperson were to put his hand upon their head they would kill him; and\r\nthey do not build houses with storeys, in order that they may not\r\nwalk over each other\'s heads."\r\n\r\nThe same superstition as to the head is found in full force\r\nthroughout Polynesia. Thus of Gattanewa, a Marquesan chief, it is\r\nsaid that "to touch the top of his head, or anything which had been\r\non his head, was sacrilege. To pass over his head was an indignity\r\nnever to be forgotten." The son of a Marquesan high priest has been\r\nseen to roll on the ground in an agony of rage and despair, begging\r\nfor death, because some one had desecrated his head and deprived him\r\nof his divinity by sprinkling a few drops of water on his hair. But\r\nit was not the Marquesan chiefs only whose heads were sacred. The\r\nhead of every Marquesan was taboo, and might neither be touched nor\r\nstepped over by another; even a father might not step over the head\r\nof his sleeping child; women were forbidden to carry or touch\r\nanything that had been in contact with, or had merely hung over, the\r\nhead of their husband or father. No one was allowed to be over the\r\nhead of the king of Tonga. In Tahiti any one who stood over the king\r\nor queen, or passed his hand over their heads, might be put to\r\ndeath. Until certain rites were performed over it, a Tahitian infant\r\nwas especially taboo; whatever touched the child\'s head, while it\r\nwas in this state, became sacred and was deposited in a consecrated\r\nplace railed in for the purpose at the child\'s house. If a branch of\r\na tree touched the child\'s head, the tree was cut down; and if in\r\nits fall it injured another tree so as to penetrate the bark, that\r\ntree also was cut down as unclean and unfit for use. After the rites\r\nwere performed these special taboos ceased; but the head of a\r\nTahitian was always sacred, he never carried anything on it, and to\r\ntouch it was an offence. So sacred was the head of a Maori chief\r\nthat "if he only touched it with his fingers, he was obliged\r\nimmediately to apply them to his nose, and snuff up the sanctity\r\nwhich they had acquired by the touch, and thus restore it to the\r\npart from whence it was taken." On account of the sacredness of his\r\nhead a Maori chief "could not blow the fire with his mouth, for the\r\nbreath being sacred, communicated his sanctity to it, and a brand\r\nmight be taken by a slave, or a man of another tribe, or the fire\r\nmight be used for other purposes, such as cooking, and so cause his\r\ndeath."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Hair tabooed\r\n\r\nWHEN the head was considered so sacred that it might not even be\r\ntouched without grave offence, it is obvious that the cutting of the\r\nhair must have been a delicate and difficult operation. The\r\ndifficulties and dangers which, on the primitive view, beset the\r\noperation are of two kinds. There is first the danger of disturbing\r\nthe spirit of the head, which may be injured in the process and may\r\nrevenge itself upon the person who molests him. Secondly, there is\r\nthe difficulty of disposing of the shorn locks. For the savage\r\nbelieves that the sympathetic connexion which exists between himself\r\nand every part of his body continues to exist even after the\r\nphysical connexion has been broken, and that therefore he will\r\nsuffer from any harm that may befall the several parts of his body,\r\nsuch as the clippings of his hair or the parings of his nails.\r\nAccordingly he takes care that these severed portions of himself\r\nshall not be left in places where they might either be exposed to\r\naccidental injury or fall into the hands of malicious persons who\r\nmight work magic on them to his detriment or death. Such dangers are\r\ncommon to all, but sacred persons have more to fear from them than\r\nordinary people, so the precautions taken by them are\r\nproportionately stringent. The simplest way of evading the peril is\r\nnot to cut the hair at all; and this is the expedient adopted where\r\nthe risk is thought to be more than usually great. The Frankish\r\nkings were never allowed to crop their hair; from their childhood\r\nupwards they had to keep it unshorn. To poll the long locks that\r\nfloated on their shoulders would have been to renounce their right\r\nto the throne. When the wicked brothers Clotaire and Childebert\r\ncoveted the kingdom of their dead brother Clodomir, they inveigled\r\ninto their power their little nephews, the two sons of Clodomir; and\r\nhaving done so, they sent a messenger bearing scissors and a naked\r\nsword to the children\'s grandmother, Queen Clotilde, at Paris. The\r\nenvoy showed the scissors and the sword to Clotilde, and bade her\r\nchoose whether the children should be shorn and live or remain\r\nunshorn and die. The proud queen replied that if her grandchildren\r\nwere not to come to the throne she would rather see them dead than\r\nshorn. And murdered they were by their ruthless uncle Clotaire with\r\nhis own hand. The king of Ponape, one of the Caroline Islands, must\r\nwear his hair long, and so must his grandees. Among the Hos, a negro\r\ntribe of West Africa, "there are priests on whose head no razor may\r\ncome during the whole of their lives. The god who dwells in the man\r\nforbids the cutting of his hair on pain of death. If the hair is at\r\nlast too long, the owner must pray to his god to allow him at least\r\nto clip the tips of it. The hair is in fact conceived as the seat\r\nand lodging-place of his god, so that were it shorn the god would\r\nlose his abode in the priest." The members of a Masai clan, who are\r\nbelieved to possess the art of making rain, may not pluck out their\r\nbeards, because the loss of their beards would, it is supposed,\r\nentail the loss of their rain-making powers. The head chief and the\r\nsorcerers of the Masai observe the same rule for a like reason: they\r\nthink that were they to pull out their beards, their supernatural\r\ngifts would desert them.\r\n\r\nAgain, men who have taken a vow of vengeance sometimes keep their\r\nhair unshorn till they have fulfilled their vow. Thus of the\r\nMarquesans we are told that "occasionally they have their head\r\nentirely shaved, except one lock on the crown, which is worn loose\r\nor put up in a knot. But the latter mode of wearing the hair is only\r\nadopted by them when they have a solemn vow, as to revenge the death\r\nof some near relation, etc. In such case the lock is never cut off\r\nuntil they have fulfilled their promise." A similar custom was\r\nsometimes observed by the ancient Germans; among the Chatti the\r\nyoung warriors never clipped their hair or their beard till they had\r\nslain an enemy. Among the Toradjas, when a child\'s hair is cut to\r\nrid it of vermin, some locks are allowed to remain on the crown of\r\nthe head as a refuge for one of the child\'s souls. Otherwise the\r\nsoul would have no place in which to settle, and the child would\r\nsicken. The Karo-Bataks are much afraid of frightening away the soul\r\nof a child; hence when they cut its hair, they always leave a patch\r\nunshorn, to which the soul can retreat before the shears. Usually\r\nthis lock remains unshorn all through life, or at least up till\r\nmanhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Ceremonies at Hair-cutting\r\n\r\nBUT when it becomes necessary to crop the hair, measures are taken\r\nto lessen the dangers which are supposed to attend the operation.\r\nThe chief of Namosi in Fiji always ate a man by way of precaution\r\nwhen he had had his hair cut. "There was a certain clan that had to\r\nprovide the victim, and they used to sit in solemn council among\r\nthemselves to choose him. It was a sacrificial feast to avert evil\r\nfrom the chief." Amongst the Maoris many spells were uttered at\r\nhair-cutting; one, for example, was spoken to consecrate the\r\nobsidian knife with which the hair was cut; another was pronounced\r\nto avert the thunder and lightning which hair-cutting was believed\r\nto cause. "He who has had his hair cut is in immediate charge of the\r\nAtua (spirit); he is removed from the contact and society of his\r\nfamily and his tribe; he dare not touch his food himself; it is put\r\ninto his mouth by another person; nor can he for some days resume\r\nhis accustomed occupations or associate with his fellow-men." The\r\nperson who cuts the hair is also tabooed; his hands having been in\r\ncontact with a sacred head, he may not touch food with them or\r\nengage in any other employment; he is fed by another person with\r\nfood cooked over a sacred fire. He cannot be released from the taboo\r\nbefore the following day, when he rubs his hands with potato or fern\r\nroot which has been cooked on a sacred fire; and this food having\r\nbeen taken to the head of the family in the female line and eaten by\r\nher, his hands are freed from the taboo. In some parts of New\r\nZealand the most sacred day of the year was that appointed for\r\nhair-cutting; the people assembled in large numbers on that day from\r\nall the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Disposal of Cut Hair and Nails\r\n\r\nBUT even when the hair and nails have been safely cut, there remains\r\nthe difficulty of disposing of them, for their owner believes\r\nhimself liable to suffer from any harm that may befall them. The\r\nnotion that a man may be bewitched by means of the clippings of his\r\nhair, the parings of his nails, or any other severed portion of his\r\nperson is almost world-wide, and attested by evidence too ample, too\r\nfamiliar, and too tedious in its uniformity to be here analysed at\r\nlength. The general idea on which the superstition rests is that of\r\nthe sympathetic connexion supposed to persist between a person and\r\neverything that has once been part of his body or in any way closely\r\nrelated to him. A very few examples must suffice. They belong to\r\nthat branch of sympathetic magic which may be called contagious.\r\nDread of sorcery, we are told, formed one of the most salient\r\ncharacteristics of the Marquesan islanders in the old days. The\r\nsorcerer took some of the hair, spittle, or other bodily refuse of\r\nthe man he wished to injure, wrapped it up in a leaf, and placed the\r\npacket in a bag woven of threads or fibres, which were knotted in an\r\nintricate way. The whole was then buried with certain rites, and\r\nthereupon the victim wasted away of a languishing sickness which\r\nlasted twenty days. His life, however, might be saved by discovering\r\nand digging up the buried hair, spittle, or what not; for as soon as\r\nthis was done the power of the charm ceased. A Maori sorcerer intent\r\non bewitching somebody sought to get a tress of his victim\'s hair,\r\nthe parings of his nails, some of his spittle, or a shred of his\r\ngarment. Having obtained the object, whatever it was, he chanted\r\ncertain spells and curses over it in a falsetto voice and buried it\r\nin the ground. As the thing decayed, the person to whom it had\r\nbelonged was supposed to waste away. When an Australian blackfellow\r\nwishes to get rid of his wife, he cuts off a lock of her hair in her\r\nsleep, ties it to his spear-thrower, and goes with it to a\r\nneighbouring tribe, where he gives it to a friend. His friend sticks\r\nthe spear-thrower up every night before the camp fire, and when it\r\nfalls down it is a sign that the wife is dead. The way in which the\r\ncharm operates was explained to Dr. Howitt by a Wirajuri man. "You\r\nsee," he said, "when a blackfellow doctor gets hold of something\r\nbelonging to a man and roasts it with things, and sings over it, the\r\nfire catches hold of the smell of the man, and that settles the poor\r\nfellow."\r\n\r\nThe Huzuls of the Carpathians imagine that if mice get a person\'s\r\nshorn hair and make a nest of it, the person will suffer from\r\nheadache or even become idiotic. Similarly in Germany it is a common\r\nnotion that if birds find a person\'s cut hair, and build their nests\r\nwith it, the person will suffer from headache; sometimes it is\r\nthought that he will have an eruption on the head. The same\r\nsuperstition prevails, or used to prevail, in West Sussex.\r\n\r\nAgain it is thought that cut or combed-out hair may disturb the\r\nweather by producing rain and hail, thunder and lightning. We have\r\nseen that in New Zealand a spell was uttered at hair-cutting to\r\navert thunder and lightning. In the Tyrol, witches are supposed to\r\nuse cut or combed-out hair to make hailstones or thunderstorms with.\r\nThlinkeet Indians have been known to attribute stormy weather to the\r\nrash act of a girl who had combed her hair outside of the house. The\r\nRomans seem to have held similar views, for it was a maxim with them\r\nthat no one on shipboard should cut his hair or nails except in a\r\nstorm, that is, when the mischief was already done. In the Highlands\r\nof Scotland it is said that no sister should comb her hair at night\r\nif she have a brother at sea. In West Africa, when the Mani of\r\nChitombe or Jumba died, the people used to run in crowds to the\r\ncorpse and tear out his hair, teeth, and nails, which they kept as a\r\nrain-charm, believing that otherwise no rain would fall. The Makoko\r\nof the Anzikos begged the missionaries to give him half their beards\r\nas a rain-charm.\r\n\r\nIf cut hair and nails remain in sympathetic connexion with the\r\nperson from whose body they have been severed, it is clear that they\r\ncan be used as hostages for his good behaviour by any one who may\r\nchance to possess them; for on the principles of contagious magic he\r\nhas only to injure the hair or nails in order to hurt simultaneously\r\ntheir original owner. Hence when the Nandi have taken a prisoner\r\nthey shave his head and keep the shorn hair as a surety that he will\r\nnot attempt to escape; but when the captive is ransomed, they return\r\nhis shorn hair with him to his own people.\r\n\r\nTo preserve the cut hair and nails from injury and from the\r\ndangerous uses to which they may be put by sorcerers, it is\r\nnecessary to deposit them in some safe place. The shorn locks of a\r\nMaori chief were gathered with much care and placed in an adjoining\r\ncemetery. The Tahitians buried the cuttings of their hair at the\r\ntemples. In the streets of Soku a modern traveller observed cairns\r\nof large stones piled against walls with tufts of human hair\r\ninserted in the crevices. On asking the meaning of this, he was told\r\nthat when any native of the place polled his hair he carefully\r\ngathered up the clippings and deposited them in one of these cairns,\r\nall of which were sacred to the fetish and therefore inviolable.\r\nThese cairns of sacred stones, he further learned, were simply a\r\nprecaution against witchcraft, for if a man were not thus careful in\r\ndisposing of his hair, some of it might fall into the hands of his\r\nenemies, who would, by means of it, be able to cast spells over him\r\nand so compass his destruction. When the top-knot of a Siamese child\r\nhas been cut with great ceremony, the short hairs are put into a\r\nlittle vessel made of plantain leaves and set adrift on the nearest\r\nriver or canal. As they float away, all that was wrong or harmful in\r\nthe child\'s disposition is believed to depart with them. The long\r\nhairs are kept till the child makes a pilgrimage to the holy\r\nFootprint of Buddha on the sacred hill at Prabat. They are then\r\npresented to the priests, who are supposed to make them into brushes\r\nwith which they sweep the Footprint; but in fact so much hair is\r\nthus offered every year that the priests cannot use it all, so they\r\nquietly burn the superfluity as soon as the pilgrims\' backs are\r\nturned. The cut hair and nails of the Flamen Dialis were buried\r\nunder a lucky tree. The shorn tresses of the Vestal Virgins were\r\nhung on an ancient lotus-tree.\r\n\r\nOften the clipped hair and nails are stowed away in any secret\r\nplace, not necessarily in a temple or cemetery or at a tree, as in\r\nthe cases already mentioned. Thus in Swabia you are recommended to\r\ndeposit your clipped hair in some spot where neither sun nor moon\r\ncan shine on it, for example in the earth or under a stone. In\r\nDanzig it is buried in a bag under the threshold. In Ugi, one of the\r\nSolomon Islands, men bury their hair lest it should fall into the\r\nhands of an enemy, who would make magic with it and so bring\r\nsickness or calamity on them. The same fear seems to be general in\r\nMelanesia, and has led to a regular practice of hiding cut hair and\r\nnails. The same practice prevails among many tribes of South Africa,\r\nfrom a fear lest wizards should get hold of the severed particles\r\nand work evil with them. The Caffres carry still further this dread\r\nof allowing any portion of themselves to fall into the hands of an\r\nenemy; for not only do they bury their cut hair and nails in a\r\nsecret spot, but when one of them cleans the head of another he\r\npreserves the vermin which he catches, "carefully delivering them to\r\nthe person to whom they originally appertained, supposing, according\r\nto their theory, that as they derived their support from the blood\r\nof the man from whom they were taken, should they be killed by\r\nanother, the blood of his neighbour would be in his possession, thus\r\nplacing in his hands the power of some superhuman influence."\r\n\r\nSometimes the severed hair and nails are preserved, not to prevent\r\nthem from falling into the hands of a magician, but that the owner\r\nmay have them at the resurrection of the body, to which some races\r\nlook forward. Thus the Incas of Peru "took extreme care to preserve\r\nthe nail-parings and the hairs that were shorn off or torn out with\r\na comb; placing them in holes or niches in the walls; and if they\r\nfell out, any other Indian that saw them picked them up and put them\r\nin their places again. I very often asked different Indians, at\r\nvarious times, why they did this, in order to see what they would\r\nsay, and they all replied in the same words saying, \'Know that all\r\npersons who are born must return to life\' (they have no word to\r\nexpress resurrection), \'and the souls must rise out of their tombs\r\nwith all that belonged to their bodies. We, therefore, in order that\r\nwe may not have to search for our hair and nails at a time when\r\nthere will be much hurry and confusion, place them in one place,\r\nthat they may be brought together more conveniently, and, whenever\r\nit is possible, we are also careful to spit in one place.\'"\r\nSimilarly the Turks never throw away the parings of their nails, but\r\ncarefully stow them in cracks of the walls or of the boards, in the\r\nbelief that they will be needed at the resurrection. The Armenians\r\ndo not throw away their cut hair and nails and extracted teeth, but\r\nhide them in places that are esteemed holy, such as a crack in the\r\nchurch wall, a pillar of the house, or a hollow tree. They think\r\nthat all these severed portions of themselves will be wanted at the\r\nresurrection, and that he who has not stowed them away in a safe\r\nplace will have to hunt about for them on the great day. In the\r\nvillage of Drumconrath in Ireland there used to be some old women\r\nwho, having ascertained from Scripture that the hairs of their heads\r\nwere all numbered by the Almighty, expected to have to account for\r\nthem at the day of judgment. In order to be able to do so they\r\nstuffed the severed hair away in the thatch of their cottages.\r\n\r\nSome people burn their loose hair to save it from falling into the\r\nhands of sorcerers. This is done by the Patagonians and some of the\r\nVictorian tribes. In the Upper Vosges they say that you should never\r\nleave the clippings of your hair and nails lying about, but burn\r\nthem to hinder the sorcerers from using them against you. For the\r\nsame reason Italian women either burn their loose hairs or throw\r\nthem into a place where no one is likely to look for them. The\r\nalmost universal dread of witchcraft induces the West African\r\nnegroes, the Makololo of South Africa, and the Tahitians to burn or\r\nbury their shorn hair. In the Tyrol many people burn their hair lest\r\nthe witches should use it to raise thunderstorms; others burn or\r\nbury it to prevent the birds from lining their nests with it, which\r\nwould cause the heads from which the hair came to ache.\r\n\r\nThis destruction of the hair and nails plainly involves an\r\ninconsistency of thought. The object of the destruction is avowedly\r\nto prevent these severed portions of the body from being used by\r\nsorcerers. But the possibility of their being so used depends upon\r\nthe supposed sympathetic connexion between them and the man from\r\nwhom they were severed. And if this sympathetic connexion still\r\nexists, clearly these severed portions cannot be destroyed without\r\ninjury to the man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. Spittle tabooed\r\n\r\nTHE SAME fear of witchcraft which has led so many people to hide or\r\ndestroy their loose hair and nails has induced other or the same\r\npeople to treat their spittle in a like fashion. For on the\r\nprinciples of sympathetic magic the spittle is part of the man, and\r\nwhatever is done to it will have a corresponding effect on him. A\r\nChilote Indian, who has gathered up the spittle of an enemy, will\r\nput it in a potato, and hang the potato in the smoke, uttering\r\ncertain spells as he does so in the belief that his foe will waste\r\naway as the potato dries in the smoke. Or he will put the spittle in\r\na frog and throw the animal into an inaccessible, unnavigable river,\r\nwhich will make the victim quake and shake with ague. The natives of\r\nUrewera, a district of New Zealand, enjoyed a high reputation for\r\ntheir skill in magic. It was said that they made use of people\'s\r\nspittle to bewitch them. Hence visitors were careful to conceal\r\ntheir spittle, lest they should furnish these wizards with a handle\r\nfor working them harm. Similarly among some tribes of South Africa\r\nno man will spit when an enemy is near, lest his foe should find the\r\nspittle and give it to a wizard, who would then mix it with magical\r\ningredients so as to injure the person from whom it fell. Even in a\r\nman\'s own house his saliva is carefully swept away and obliterated\r\nfor a similar reason.\r\n\r\nIf common folk are thus cautious, it is natural that kings and\r\nchiefs should be doubly so. In the Sandwich Islands chiefs were\r\nattended by a confidential servant bearing a portable spittoon, and\r\nthe deposit was carefully buried every morning to put it out of the\r\nreach of sorcerers. On the Slave Coast, for the same reason,\r\nwhenever a king or chief expectorates, the saliva is scrupulously\r\ngathered up and hidden or buried. The same precautions are taken for\r\nthe same reason with the spittle of the chief of Tabali in Southern\r\nNigeria.\r\n\r\nThe magical use to which spittle may be put marks it out, like blood\r\nor nail-parings, as a suitable material basis for a covenant, since\r\nby exchanging their saliva the covenanting parties give each other a\r\nguarantee of good faith. If either of them afterwards foreswears\r\nhimself, the other can punish his perfidy by a magical treatment of\r\nthe purjurer\'s spittle which he has in his custody. Thus when the\r\nWajagga of East Africa desire to make a covenant, the two parties\r\nwill sometimes sit down with a bowl of milk or beer between them,\r\nand after uttering an incantation over the beverage they each take a\r\nmouthful of the milk or beer and spit it into the other\'s mouth. In\r\nurgent cases, when there is no time to spend on ceremony, the two\r\nwill simply spit into each other\'s mouth, which seals the covenant\r\njust as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Foods tabooed\r\n\r\nAS MIGHT have been expected, the superstitions of the savage cluster\r\nthick about the subject of food; and he abstains from eating many\r\nanimals and plants, wholesome enough in themselves, which for one\r\nreason or another he fancies would prove dangerous or fatal to the\r\neater. Examples of such abstinence are too familiar and far too\r\nnumerous to quote. But if the ordinary man is thus deterred by\r\nsuperstitious fear from partaking of various foods, the restraints\r\nof this kind which are laid upon sacred or tabooed persons, such as\r\nkings and priests, are still more numerous and stringent. We have\r\nalready seen that the Flamen Dialis was forbidden to eat or even\r\nname several plants and animals, and that the flesh diet of Egyptian\r\nkings was restricted to veal and goose. In antiquity many priests\r\nand many kings of barbarous peoples abstained wholly from a flesh\r\ndiet. The _Gangas_ or fetish priests of the Loango Coast are\r\nforbidden to eat or even see a variety of animals and fish, in\r\nconsequence of which their flesh diet is extremely limited; often\r\nthey live only on herbs and roots, though they may drink fresh\r\nblood. The heir to the throne of Loango is forbidden from infancy to\r\neat pork; from early childhood he is interdicted the use of the\r\n_cola_ fruit in company; at puberty he is taught by a priest not to\r\npartake of fowls except such as he has himself killed and cooked;\r\nand so the number of taboos goes on increasing with his years. In\r\nFernando Po the king after installation is forbidden to eat cocco\r\n(_arum acaule_), deer, and porcupine, which are the ordinary foods\r\nof the people. The head chief of the Masai may eat nothing but milk,\r\nhoney, and the roasted livers of goats; for if he partook of any\r\nother food he would lose his power of soothsaying and of compounding\r\ncharms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11. Knots and Rings tabooed\r\n\r\nWE have seen that among the many taboos which the Flamen Dialis at\r\nRome had to observe, there was one that forbade him to have a knot\r\non any part of his garments, and another that obliged him to wear no\r\nring unless it were broken. In like manner Moslem pilgrims to Mecca\r\nare in a state of sanctity or taboo and may wear on their persons\r\nneither knots nor rings. These rules are probably of kindred\r\nsignificance, and may conveniently be considered together. To begin\r\nwith knots, many people in different parts of the world entertain a\r\nstrong objection to having any knot about their person at certain\r\ncritical seasons, particularly childbirth, marriage, and death. Thus\r\namong the Saxons of Transylvania, when a woman is in travail all\r\nknots on her garments are untied, because it is believed that this\r\nwill facilitate her delivery, and with the same intention all the\r\nlocks in the house, whether on doors or boxes, are unlocked. The\r\nLapps think that a lying-in woman should have no knot on her\r\ngarments, because a knot would have the effect of making the\r\ndelivery difficult and painful. In the East Indies this superstition\r\nis extended to the whole time of pregnancy; the people believe that\r\nif a pregnant woman were to tie knots, or braid, or make anything\r\nfast, the child would thereby be constricted or the woman would\r\nherself be "tied up" when her time came. Nay, some of them enforce\r\nthe observance of the rule on the father as well as the mother of\r\nthe unborn child. Among the Sea Dyaks neither of the parents may\r\nbind up anything with a string or make anything fast during the\r\nwife\'s pregnancy. In the Toumbuluh tribe of North Celebes a ceremony\r\nis performed in the fourth or fifth month of a woman\'s pregnancy,\r\nand after it her husband is forbidden, among many other things, to\r\ntie any fast knots and to sit with his legs crossed over each other.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases the idea seems to be that the tying of a knot\r\nwould, as they say in the East Indies, "tie up" the woman, in other\r\nwords, impede and perhaps prevent her delivery, or delay her\r\nconvalescence after the birth. On the principles of homoeopathic or\r\nimitative magic the physical obstacle or impediment of a knot on a\r\ncord would create a corresponding obstacle or impediment in the body\r\nof the woman. That this is really the explanation of the rule\r\nappears from a custom observed by the Hos of West Africa at a\r\ndifficult birth. When a woman is in hard labour and cannot bring\r\nforth, they call in a magician to her aid. He looks at her and says,\r\n"The child is bound in the womb, that is why she cannot be\r\ndelivered." On the entreaties of her female relations he then\r\npromises to loosen the bond so that she may bring forth. For that\r\npurpose he orders them to fetch a tough creeper from the forest, and\r\nwith it he binds the hands and feet of the sufferer on her back.\r\nThen he takes a knife and calls out the woman\'s name, and when she\r\nanswers he cuts through the creeper with a knife, saying, "I cut\r\nthrough to-day thy bonds and thy child\'s bonds." After that he chops\r\nup the creeper small, puts the bits in a vessel of water, and bathes\r\nthe woman with the water. Here the cutting of the creeper with which\r\nthe woman\'s hands and feet are bound is a simple piece of\r\nhomoeopathic or imitative magic: by releasing her limbs from their\r\nbonds the magician imagines that he simultaneously releases the\r\nchild in her womb from the trammels which impede its birth. The same\r\ntrain of thought underlies a practice observed by some peoples of\r\nopening all locks, doors, and so on, while a birth is taking place\r\nin the house. We have seen that at such a time the Germans of\r\nTransylvania open all the locks, and the same thing is done also in\r\nVoigtland and Mecklenburg. In North-western Argyllshire\r\nsuperstitious people used to open every lock in the house at\r\nchildbirth. In the island of Salsette near Bombay, when a woman is\r\nin hard labour, all locks of doors or drawers are opened with a key\r\nto facilitate her delivery. Among the Mandelings of Sumatra the lids\r\nof all chests, boxes, pans, and so forth are opened; and if this\r\ndoes not produce the desired effect, the anxious husband has to\r\nstrike the projecting ends of some of the house-beams in order to\r\nloosen them; for they think that "everything must be open and loose\r\nto facilitate the delivery." In Chittagong, when a woman cannot\r\nbring her child to the birth, the midwife gives orders to throw all\r\ndoors and windows wide open, to uncork all bottles, to remove the\r\nbungs from all casks, to unloose the cows in the stall, the horses\r\nin the stable, the watchdog in his kennel, to set free sheep, fowls,\r\nducks, and so forth. This universal liberty accorded to the animals\r\nand even to inanimate things is, according to the people, an\r\ninfallible means of ensuring the woman\'s delivery and allowing the\r\nbabe to be born. In the island of Saghalien, when a woman is in\r\nlabour, her husband undoes everything that can be undone. He loosens\r\nthe plaits of his hair and the laces of his shoes. Then he unties\r\nwhatever is tied in the house or its vicinity. In the courtyard he\r\ntakes the axe out of the log in which it is stuck; he unfastens the\r\nboat, if it is moored to a tree, he withdraws the cartridges from\r\nhis gun, and the arrows from his crossbow.\r\n\r\nAgain, we have seen that a Toumbuluh man abstains not only from\r\ntying knots, but also from sitting with crossed legs during his\r\nwife\'s pregnancy. The train of thought is the same in both cases.\r\nWhether you cross threads in tying a knot, or only cross your legs\r\nin sitting at your ease, you are equally, on the principles of\r\nhomoeopathic magic, crossing or thwarting the free course of things,\r\nand your action cannot but check and impede whatever may be going\r\nforward in your neighbourhood. Of this important truth the Romans\r\nwere fully aware. To sit beside a pregnant woman or a patient under\r\nmedical treatment with clasped hands, says the grave Pliny, is to\r\ncast a malignant spell over the person, and it is worse still if you\r\nnurse your leg or legs with your clasped hands, or lay one leg over\r\nthe other. Such postures were regarded by the old Romans as a let\r\nand hindrance to business of every sort, and at a council of war or\r\na meeting of magistrates, at prayers and sacrifices, no man was\r\nsuffered to cross his legs or clasp his hands. The stock instance of\r\nthe dreadful consequences that might flow from doing one or the\r\nother was that of Alcmena, who travailed with Hercules for seven\r\ndays and seven nights, because the goddess Lucina sat in front of\r\nthe house with clasped hands and crossed legs, and the child could\r\nnot be born until the goddess had been beguiled into changing her\r\nattitude. It is a Bulgarian superstition that if a pregnant woman is\r\nin the habit of sitting with crossed legs, she will suffer much in\r\nchildbed. In some parts of Bavaria, when conversation comes to a\r\nstandstill and silence ensues, they say, "Surely somebody has\r\ncrossed his legs."\r\n\r\nThe magical effect of knots in trammelling and obstructing human\r\nactivity was believed to be manifested at marriage not less than at\r\nbirth. During the Middle Ages, and down to the eighteenth century,\r\nit seems to have been commonly held in Europe that the consummation\r\nof marriage could be prevented by any one who, while the wedding\r\nceremony was taking place, either locked a lock or tied a knot in a\r\ncord, and then threw the lock or the cord away. The lock or the\r\nknotted cord had to be flung into water; and until it had been found\r\nand unlocked, or untied, no real union of the married pair was\r\npossible. Hence it was a grave offence, not only to cast such a\r\nspell, but also to steal or make away with the material instrument\r\nof it, whether lock or knotted cord. In the year 1718 the parliament\r\nof Bordeaux sentenced some one to be burned alive for having spread\r\ndesolation through a whole family by means of knotted cords; and in\r\n1705 two persons were condemned to death in Scotland for stealing\r\ncertain charmed knots which a woman had made, in order thereby to\r\nmar the wedded happiness of Spalding of Ashintilly. The belief in\r\nthe efficacy of these charms appears to have lingered in the\r\nHighlands of Pertshire down to the end of the eighteenth century,\r\nfor at that time it was still customary in the beautiful parish of\r\nLogierait, between the river Tummel and the river Tay, to unloose\r\ncarefully every knot in the clothes of the bride and bridegroom\r\nbefore the celebration of the marriage ceremony. We meet with the\r\nsame superstition and the same custom at the present day in Syria.\r\nThe persons who help a Syrian bridegroom to don his wedding garments\r\ntake care that no knot is tied on them and no button buttoned, for\r\nthey believe that a button buttoned or a knot tied would put it\r\nwithin the power of his enemies to deprive him of his nuptial rights\r\nby magical means. The fear of such charms is diffused all over North\r\nAfrica at the present day. To render a bridegroom impotent the\r\nenchanter has only to tie a knot in a handkerchief which he had\r\npreviously placed quietly on some part of the bridegroom\'s body when\r\nhe was mounted on horseback ready to fetch his bride: so long as the\r\nknot in the handkerchief remains tied, so long will the bridegroom\r\nremain powerless to consummate the marriage.\r\n\r\nThe maleficent power of knots may also be manifested in the\r\ninfliction of sickness, disease, and all kinds of misfortune. Thus\r\namong the Hos of West Africa a sorcerer will sometimes curse his\r\nenemy and tie a knot in a stalk of grass, saying, "I have tied up\r\nSo-and-so in this knot. May all evil light upon him! When he goes\r\ninto the field, may a snake sting him! When he goes to the chase,\r\nmay a ravening beast attack him! And when he steps into a river, may\r\nthe water sweep him away! When it rains, may the lightning strike\r\nhim! May evil nights be his!" It is believed that in the knot the\r\nsorcerer has bound up the life of his enemy. In the Koran there is\r\nan allusion to the mischief of "those who puff into the knots," and\r\nan Arab commentator on the passage explains that the words refer to\r\nwomen who practise magic by tying knots in cords, and then blowing\r\nand spitting upon them. He goes on to relate how, once upon a time,\r\na wicked Jew bewitched the prophet Mohammed himself by tying nine\r\nknots on a string, which he then hid in a well. So the prophet fell\r\nill, and nobody knows what might have happened if the archangel\r\nGabriel had not opportunely revealed to the holy man the place where\r\nthe knotted cord was concealed. The trusty Ali soon fetched the\r\nbaleful thing from the well; and the prophet recited over it certain\r\ncharms, which were specially revealed to him for the purpose. At\r\nevery verse of the charms a knot untied itself, and the prophet\r\nexperienced a certain relief.\r\n\r\nIf knots are supposed to kill, they are also supposed to cure. This\r\nfollows from the belief that to undo the knots which are causing\r\nsickness will bring the sufferer relief. But apart from this\r\nnegative virtue of maleficent knots, there are certain beneficent\r\nknots to which a positive power of healing is ascribed. Pliny tells\r\nus that some folk cured diseases of the groin by taking a thread\r\nfrom a web, tying seven or nine knots on it, and then fastening it\r\nto the patient\'s groin; but to make the cure effectual it was\r\nnecessary to name some widow as each knot was tied. O\'Donovan\r\ndescribes a remedy for fever employed among the Turcomans. The\r\nenchanter takes some camel hair and spins it into a stout thread,\r\ndroning a spell the while. Next he ties seven knots on the thread,\r\nblowing on each knot before he pulls it tight. This knotted thread\r\nis then worn as a bracelet on his wrist by the patient. Every day\r\none of the knots is untied and blown upon, and when the seventh knot\r\nis undone the whole thread is rolled up into a ball and thrown into\r\na river, bearing away (as they imagine) the fever with it.\r\n\r\nAgain knots may be used by an enchantress to win a lover and attach\r\nhim firmly to herself. Thus the love-sick maid in Virgil seeks to\r\ndraw Daphnis to her from the city by spells and by tying three knots\r\non each of three strings of different colours. So an Arab maiden,\r\nwho had lost her heart to a certain man, tried to gain his love and\r\nbind him to herself by tying knots in his whip; but her jealous\r\nrival undid the knots. On the same principle magic knots may be\r\nemployed to stop a runaway. In Swazieland you may often see grass\r\ntied in knots at the side of the footpaths. Every one of these knots\r\ntells of a domestic tragedy. A wife has run away from her husband,\r\nand he and his friends have gone in pursuit, binding up the paths,\r\nas they call it, in this fashion to prevent the fugitive from\r\ndoubling back over them. A net, from its affluence of knots, has\r\nalways been considered in Russia very efficacious against sorcerers;\r\nhence in some places, when a bride is being dressed in her wedding\r\nattire, a fishing-net is flung over her to keep her out of harm\'s\r\nway. For a similar purpose the bridegroom and his companions are\r\noften girt with pieces of net, or at least with tight-drawn girdles,\r\nfor before a wizard can begin to injure them he must undo all the\r\nknots in the net, or take off the girdles. But often a Russian\r\namulet is merely a knotted thread. A skein of red wool wound about\r\nthe arms and legs is thought to ward off agues and fevers; and nine\r\nskeins, fastened round a child\'s neck, are deemed a preservative\r\nagainst scarlatina. In the Tver Government a bag of a special kind\r\nis tied to the neck of the cow which walks before the rest of a\r\nherd, in order to keep off wolves; its force binds the maw of the\r\nravening beast. On the same principle, a padlock is carried thrice\r\nround a herd of horses before they go afield in the spring, and the\r\nbearer locks and unlocks it as he goes, saying, "I lock from my herd\r\nthe mouths of the grey wolves with this steel lock."\r\n\r\nKnots and locks may serve to avert not only wizards and wolves but\r\ndeath itself. When they brought a woman to the stake at St. Andrews\r\nin 1572 to burn her alive for a witch, they found on her a white\r\ncloth like a collar, with strings and many knots on the strings.\r\nThey took it from her, sorely against her will, for she seemed to\r\nthink that she could not die in the fire, if only the cloth with the\r\nknotted strings was on her. When it was taken away, she said, "Now I\r\nhave no hope of myself." In many parts of England it is thought that\r\na person cannot die so long as any locks are locked or bolts shot in\r\nthe house. It is therefore a very common practice to undo all locks\r\nand bolts when the sufferer is plainly near his end, in order that\r\nhis agony may not be unduly prolonged. For example, in the year\r\n1863, at Taunton, a child lay sick of scarlatina and death seemed\r\ninevitable. "A jury of matrons was, as it were, empanelled, and to\r\nprevent the child \'dying hard\' all the doors in the house, all the\r\ndrawers, all the boxes, all the cupboards were thrown wide open, the\r\nkeys taken out, and the body of the child placed under a beam,\r\nwhereby a sure, certain, and easy passage into eternity could be\r\nsecured." Strange to say, the child declined to avail itself of the\r\nfacilities for dying so obligingly placed at its disposal by the\r\nsagacity and experience of the British matrons of Taunton; it\r\npreferred to live rather than give up the ghost just then.\r\n\r\nThe rule which prescribes that at certain magical and religious\r\nceremonies the hair should hang loose and the feet should be bare is\r\nprobably based on the same fear of trammelling and impeding the\r\naction in hand, whatever it may be, by the presence of any knot or\r\nconstriction, whether on the head or on the feet of the performer. A\r\nsimilar power to bind and hamper spiritual as well as bodily\r\nactivities is ascribed by some people to rings. Thus in the island\r\nof Carpathus people never button the clothes they put upon a dead\r\nbody and they are careful to remove all rings from it; "for the\r\nspirit, they say, can even be detained in the little finger, and\r\ncannot rest." Here it is plain that even if the soul is not\r\ndefinitely supposed to issue at death from the finger-tips, yet the\r\nring is conceived to exercise a certain constrictive influence which\r\ndetains and imprisons the immortal spirit in spite of its efforts to\r\nescape from the tabernacle of clay; in short the ring, like the\r\nknot, acts as a spiritual fetter. This may have been the reason of\r\nan ancient Greek maxim, attributed to Pythagoras, which forbade\r\npeople to wear rings. Nobody might enter the ancient Arcadian\r\nsanctuary of the Mistress at Lycosura with a ring on his or her\r\nfinger. Persons who consulted the oracle of Faunus had to be chaste,\r\nto eat no flesh, and to wear no rings.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the same constriction which hinders the egress of\r\nthe soul may prevent the entrance of evil spirits; hence we find\r\nrings used as amulets against demons, witches, and ghosts. In the\r\nTyrol it is said that a woman in childbed should never take off her\r\nwedding-ring, or spirits and witches will have power over her. Among\r\nthe Lapps, the person who is about to place a corpse in the coffin\r\nreceives from the husband, wife, or children of the deceased a brass\r\nring, which he must wear fastened to his right arm until the corpse\r\nis safely deposited in the grave. The ring is believed to serve the\r\nperson as an amulet against any harm which the ghost might do to\r\nhim. How far the custom of wearing finger-rings may have been\r\ninfluenced by, or even have sprung from, a belief in their efficacy\r\nas amulets to keep the soul in the body, or demons out of it, is a\r\nquestion which seems worth considering. Here we are only concerned\r\nwith the belief in so far as it seems to throw light on the rule\r\nthat the Flamen Dialis might not wear a ring unless it were broken.\r\nTaken in conjunction with the rule which forbade him to have a knot\r\non his garments, it points to a fear that the powerful spirit\r\nembodied in him might be trammelled and hampered in its goings-out\r\nand comings-in by such corporeal and spiritual fetters as rings and\r\nknots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII. Tabooed Words\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Personal Names tabooed\r\n\r\nUNABLE to discriminate clearly between words and things, the savage\r\ncommonly fancies that the link between a name and the person or\r\nthing denominated by it is not a mere arbitrary and ideal\r\nassociation, but a real and substantial bond which unites the two in\r\nsuch a way that magic may be wrought on a man just as easily through\r\nhis name as through his hair, his nails, or any other material part\r\nof his person. In fact, primitive man regards his name as a vital\r\nportion of himself and takes care of it accordingly. Thus, for\r\nexample, the North American Indian "regards his name, not as a mere\r\nlabel, but as a distinct part of his personality, just as much as\r\nare his eyes or his teeth, and believes that injury will result as\r\nsurely from the malicious handling of his name as from a wound\r\ninflicted on any part of his physical organism. This belief was\r\nfound among the various tribes from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and\r\nhas occasioned a number of curious regulations in regard to the\r\nconcealment and change of names." Some Esquimaux take new names when\r\nthey are old, hoping thereby to get a new lease of life. The\r\nTolampoos of Celebes believe that if you write a man\'s name down you\r\ncan carry off his soul along with it. Many savages at the present\r\nday regard their names as vital parts of themselves, and therefore\r\ntake great pains to conceal their real names, lest these should give\r\nto evil-disposed persons a handle by which to injure their owners.\r\n\r\nThus, to begin with the savages who rank at the bottom of the social\r\nscale, we are told that the secrecy with which among the Australian\r\naborigines personal names are often kept from general knowledge\r\n"arises in great measure from the belief that an enemy, who knows\r\nyour name, has in it something which he can use magically to your\r\ndetriment." "An Australian black," says another writer, "is always\r\nvery unwilling to tell his real name, and there is no doubt that\r\nthis reluctance is due to the fear that through his name he may be\r\ninjured by sorcerers." Amongst the tribes of Central Australia every\r\nman, woman, and child has, besides a personal name which is in\r\ncommon use, a secret or sacred name which is bestowed by the older\r\nmen upon him or her soon after birth, and which is known to none but\r\nthe fully initiated members of the group. This secret name is never\r\nmentioned except upon the most solemn occasions; to utter it in the\r\nhearing of women or of men of another group would be a most serious\r\nbreach of tribal custom, as serious as the most flagrant case of\r\nsacrilege among ourselves. When mentioned at all, the name is spoken\r\nonly in a whisper, and not until the most elaborate precautions have\r\nbeen taken that it shall be heard by no one but members of the\r\ngroup. "The native thinks that a stranger knowing his secret name\r\nwould have special power to work him ill by means of magic."\r\n\r\nThe same fear seems to have led to a custom of the same sort amongst\r\nthe ancient Egyptians, whose comparatively high civilisation was\r\nstrangely dashed and chequered with relics of the lowest savagery.\r\nEvery Egyptian received two names, which were known respectively as\r\nthe true name and the good name, or the great name and the little\r\nname; and while the good or little name was made public, the true or\r\ngreat name appears to have been carefully concealed. A Brahman child\r\nreceives two names, one for common use, the other a secret name\r\nwhich none but his father and mother should know. The latter is only\r\nused at ceremonies such as marriage. The custom is intended to\r\nprotect the person against magic, since a charm only becomes\r\neffectual in combination with the real name. Similarly, the natives\r\nof Nias believe that harm may be done to a person by the demons who\r\nhear his name pronounced. Hence the names of infants, who are\r\nespecially exposed to the assaults of evil sprits, are never spoken;\r\nand often in haunted spots, such as the gloomy depths of the forest,\r\nthe banks of a river, or beside a bubbling spring, men will abstain\r\nfrom calling each other by their names for a like reason.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of Chiloe keep their names secret and do not like to\r\nhave them uttered aloud; for they say that there are fairies or imps\r\non the mainland or neighbouring islands who, if they knew folk\'s\r\nnames, would do them an injury; but so long as they do not know the\r\nnames, these mischievous sprites are powerless. The Araucanians will\r\nhardly ever tell a stranger their names because they fear that he\r\nwould thereby acquire some supernatural power over themselves. Asked\r\nhis name by a stranger, who is ignorant of their superstitions, an\r\nAraucanian will answer, "I have none." When an Ojebway is asked his\r\nname, he will look at some bystander and ask him to answer. "This\r\nreluctance arises from an impression they receive when young, that\r\nif they repeat their own names it will prevent their growth, and\r\nthey will be small in stature. On account of this unwillingness to\r\ntell their names, many strangers have fancied that they either have\r\nno names or have forgotten them."\r\n\r\nIn this last case no scruple seems to be felt about communicating a\r\nman\'s name to strangers, and no ill effects appear to be dreaded as\r\na consequence of divulging it; harm is only done when a name is\r\nspoken by its owner. Why is this? and why in particular should a man\r\nbe thought to stunt his growth by uttering his own name? We may\r\nconjecture that to savages who act and think thus a person\'s name\r\nonly seems to be a part of himself when it is uttered with his own\r\nbreath; uttered by the breath of others it has no vital connexion\r\nwith him, and no harm can come to him through it. Whereas, so these\r\nprimitive philosophers may have argued, when a man lets his own name\r\npass his lips, he is parting with a living piece of himself, and if\r\nhe persists in so reckless a course he must certainly end by\r\ndissipating his energy and shattering his constitution. Many a\r\nbroken-down debauchee, many a feeble frame wasted with disease, may\r\nhave been pointed out by these simple moralists to their awe-struck\r\ndisciples as a fearful example of the fate that must sooner or later\r\novertake the profligate who indulges immoderately in the seductive\r\nhabit of mentioning his own name.\r\n\r\nHowever we may explain it, the fact is certain that many a savage\r\nevinces the strongest reluctance to pronounce his own name, while at\r\nthe same time he makes no objection at all to other people\r\npronouncing it, and will even invite them to do so for him in order\r\nto satisfy the curiosity of an inquisitive stranger. Thus in some\r\nparts of Madagascar it is taboo for a person to tell his own name,\r\nbut a slave or attendant will answer for him. The same curious\r\ninconsistency, as it may seem to us, is recorded of some tribes of\r\nAmerican Indians. Thus we are told that "the name of an American\r\nIndian is a sacred thing, not to be divulged by the owner himself\r\nwithout due consideration. One may ask a warrior of any tribe to\r\ngive his name, and the question will be met with either a\r\npoint-blank refusal or the more diplomatic evasion that he cannot\r\nunderstand what is wanted of him. The moment a friend approaches,\r\nthe warrior first interrogated will whisper what is wanted, and the\r\nfriend can tell the name, receiving a reciprocation of the courtesy\r\nfrom the other." This general statement applies, for example, to the\r\nIndian tribes of British Columbia, as to whom it is said that "one\r\nof their strangest prejudices, which appears to pervade all tribes\r\nalike, is a dislike to telling their names--thus you never get a\r\nman\'s right name from himself; but they will tell each other\'s names\r\nwithout hesitation." In the whole of the East Indian Archipelago the\r\netiquette is the same. As a general rule no one will utter his own\r\nname. To enquire, "What is your name?" is a very indelicate question\r\nin native society. When in the course of administrative or judicial\r\nbusiness a native is asked his name, instead of replying he will\r\nlook at his comrade to indicate that he is to answer for him, or he\r\nwill say straight out, "Ask him." The superstition is current all\r\nover the East Indies without exception, and it is found also among\r\nthe Motu and Motumotu tribes, the Papuans of Finsch Haven in North\r\nNew Guinea, the Nufoors of Dutch New Guinea, and the Melanesians of\r\nthe Bismarck Archipelago. Among many tribes of South Africa men and\r\nwomen never mention their names if they can get any one else to do\r\nit for them, but they do not absolutely refuse when it cannot be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nSometimes the embargo laid on personal names is not permanent; it is\r\nconditional on circumstances, and when these change it ceases to\r\noperate. Thus when the Nandi men are away on a foray, nobody at home\r\nmay pronounce the names of the absent warriors; they must be\r\nreferred to as birds. Should a child so far forget itself as to\r\nmention one of the distant ones by name, the mother would rebuke it,\r\nsaying, "Don\'t talk of the birds who are in the heavens." Among the\r\nBangala of the Upper Congo, while a man is fishing and when he\r\nreturns with his catch, his proper name is in abeyance and nobody\r\nmay mention it. Whatever the fisherman\'s real name may be, he is\r\ncalled _mwele_ without distinction. The reason is that the river is\r\nfull of spirits, who, if they heard the fisherman\'s real name, might\r\nso work against him that he would catch little or nothing. Even when\r\nhe has caught his fish and landed with them, the buyer must still\r\nnot address him by his proper name, but must only call him _mwele;_\r\nfor even then, if the spirits were to hear his proper name, they\r\nwould either bear it in mind and serve him out another day, or they\r\nmight so mar the fish he had caught that he would get very little\r\nfor them. Hence the fisherman can extract heavy damages from anybody\r\nwho mentions his name, or can compel the thoughtless speaker to\r\nrelieve him of the fish at a good price so as to restore his luck.\r\nWhen the Sulka of New Britain are near the territory of their\r\nenemies the Gaktei, they take care not to mention them by their\r\nproper name, believing that were they to do so, their foes would\r\nattack and slay them. Hence in these circumstances they speak of the\r\nGaktei as _o lapsiek,_ that is, "the rotten tree-trunks," and they\r\nimagine that by calling them that they make the limbs of their\r\ndreaded enemies ponderous and clumsy like logs. This example\r\nillustrates the extremely materialistic view which these savages\r\ntake of the nature of words; they suppose that the mere utterance of\r\nan expression signifying clumsiness will homoeopathically affect\r\nwith clumsiness the limbs of their distant foemen. Another\r\nillustration of this curious misconception is furnished by a Caffre\r\nsuperstition that the character of a young thief can be reformed by\r\nshouting his name over a boiling kettle of medicated water, then\r\nclapping a lid on the kettle and leaving the name to steep in the\r\nwater for several days. It is not in the least necessary that the\r\nthief should be aware of the use that is being made of his name\r\nbehind his back; the moral reformation will be effected without his\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nWhen it is deemed necessary that a man\'s real name should be kept\r\nsecret, it is often customary, as we have seen, to call him by a\r\nsurname or nickname. As distinguished from the real or primary\r\nnames, these secondary names are apparently held to be no part of\r\nthe man himself, so that they may be freely used and divulged to\r\neverybody without endangering his safety thereby. Sometimes in order\r\nto avoid the use of his own name a man will be called after his\r\nchild. Thus we are informed that "the Gippsland blacks objected\r\nstrongly to let any one outside the tribe know their names, lest\r\ntheir enemies, learning them, should make them vehicles of\r\nincantation, and so charm their lives away. As children were not\r\nthought to have enemies, they used to speak of a man as \'the father,\r\nuncle, or cousin of So-and-so,\' naming a child; but on all occasions\r\nabstained from mentioning the name of a grown-up person." The\r\nAlfoors of Poso in Celebes will not pronounce their own names. Among\r\nthem, accordingly, if you wish to ascertain a person\'s name, you\r\nought not to ask the man himself, but should enquire of others. But\r\nif this is impossible, for example, when there is no one else near,\r\nyou should ask him his child\'s name, and then address him as the\r\n"Father of So-and-so." Nay, these Alfoors are shy of uttering the\r\nnames even of children; so when a boy or girl has a nephew or niece,\r\nhe or she is addressed as "Uncle of So-and-so," or "Aunt of\r\nSo-and-so." In pure Malay society, we are told, a man is never asked\r\nhis name, and the custom of naming parents after their children is\r\nadopted only as a means of avoiding the use of the parents\' own\r\nnames. The writer who makes this statement adds in confirmation of\r\nit that childless persons are named after their younger brothers.\r\nAmong the Land Dyaks children as they grow up are called, according\r\nto their sex, the father or mother of a child of their father\'s or\r\nmother\'s younger brother or sister, that is, they are called the\r\nfather or mother of what we should call their first cousin. The\r\nCaffres used to think it discourteous to call a bride by her own\r\nname, so they would call her "the Mother of So-and-so," even when\r\nshe was only betrothed, far less a wife and a mother. Among the\r\nKukis and Zemis or Kacha Nagas of Assam parents drop their names\r\nafter the birth of a child and are named Father and Mother of\r\nSo-and-so. Childless couples go by the name of "the childless\r\nfather," "the childless mother," "the father of no child," "the\r\nmother of no child." The widespread custom of naming a father after\r\nhis child has sometimes been supposed to spring from a desire on the\r\nfather\'s part to assert his paternity, apparently as a means of\r\nobtaining those rights over his children which had previously, under\r\na system of mother-kin, been possessed by the mother. But this\r\nexplanation does not account for the parallel custom of naming the\r\nmother after her child, which seems commonly to co-exist with the\r\npractice of naming the father after the child. Still less, if\r\npossible, does it apply to the customs of calling childless couples\r\nthe father and mother of children which do not exist, of naming\r\npeople after their younger brothers, and of designating children as\r\nthe uncles and aunts of So-and-so, or as the fathers and mothers of\r\ntheir first cousins. But all these practices are explained in a\r\nsimple and natural way if we suppose that they originate in a\r\nreluctance to utter the real names of persons addressed or directly\r\nreferred to. That reluctance is probably based partly on a fear of\r\nattracting the notice of evil spirits, partly on a dread of\r\nrevealing the name to sorcerers, who would thereby obtain a handle\r\nfor injuring the owner of the name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Names of Relations tabooed\r\n\r\nIT might naturally be expected that the reserve so commonly\r\nmaintained with regard to personal names would be dropped or at\r\nleast relaxed among relations and friends. But the reverse of this\r\nis often the case. It is precisely the persons most intimately\r\nconnected by blood and especially by marriage to whom the rule\r\napplies with the greatest stringency. Such people are often\r\nforbidden, not only to pronounce each other\'s names, but even to\r\nutter ordinary words which resemble or have a single syllable in\r\ncommon with these names. The persons who are thus mutually debarred\r\nfrom mentioning each other\'s names are especially husbands and\r\nwives, a man and his wife\'s parents, and a woman and her husband\'s\r\nfather. For example, among the Caffres a woman may not publicly\r\npronounce the birth-name of her husband or of any of his brothers,\r\nnor may she use the interdicted word in its ordinary sense. If her\r\nhusband, for instance, be called u-Mpaka, from _impaka,_ a small\r\nfeline animal, she must speak of that beast by some other name.\r\nFurther, a Caffre wife is forbidden to pronounce even mentally the\r\nnames of her father-in-law and of all her husband\'s male relations\r\nin the ascending line; and whenever the emphatic syllable of any of\r\ntheir names occurs in another word, she must avoid it by\r\nsubstituting either an entirely new word, or, at least, another\r\nsyllable in its place. Hence this custom has given rise to an almost\r\ndistinct language among the women, which the Caffres call "women\'s\r\nspeech." The interpretation of this "women\'s speech" is naturally\r\nvery difficult, "for no definite rules can be given for the\r\nformation of these substituted words, nor is it possible to form a\r\ndictionary of them, their number being so great--since there may be\r\nmany women, even in the same tribe, who would be no more at liberty\r\nto use the substitutes employed by some others, than they are to use\r\nthe original words themselves." A Caffre man, on his side, may not\r\nmention the name of his mother-in-law, nor may she pronounce his;\r\nbut he is free to utter words in which the emphatic syllable of her\r\nname occurs. A Kirghiz woman dares not pronounce the names of the\r\nolder relations of her husband, nor even use words which resemble\r\nthem in sound. For example, if one of these relations is called\r\nShepherd, she may not speak of sheep, but must call them "the\r\nbleating ones"; if his name is Lamb, she must refer to lambs as "the\r\nyoung bleating ones." In Southern India wives believe that to tell\r\ntheir husband\'s name or to pronounce it even in a dream would bring\r\nhim to an untimely end. Among the Sea Dyaks a man may not pronounce\r\nthe name of his father-in-law or mother-in-law without incurring the\r\nwrath of the spirits. And since he reckons as his father-in-law and\r\nmother-in-law not only the father and mother of his own wife, but\r\nalso the fathers and mothers of his brothers\' wives and sisters\'\r\nhusbands, and likewise the fathers and mothers of all his cousins,\r\nthe number of tabooed names may be very considerable and the\r\nopportunities of error correspondingly numerous. To make confusion\r\nworse confounded, the names of persons are often the names of common\r\nthings, such as moon, bridge, barley, cobra, leopard; so that when\r\nany of a man\'s many fathers-in-law and mothers-in-law are called by\r\nsuch names, these common words may not pass his lips. Among the\r\nAlfoors of Minahassa, in Celebes, the custom is carried still\r\nfurther so as to forbid the use even of words which merely resemble\r\nthe personal names in sound. It is especially the name of a\r\nfather-in-law which is thus laid under an interdict. If he, for\r\nexample, is called Kalala, his son-in-law may not speak of a horse\r\nby its common name _kawalo;_ he must call it a "riding-beast"\r\n(_sasakajan_). So among the Alfoors of the island of Buru it is\r\ntaboo to mention the names of parents and parents-in-law, or even to\r\nspeak of common objects by words which resemble these names in\r\nsound. Thus, if your mother-in-law is called Dalu, which means\r\n"betel," you may not ask for betel by its ordinary name, you must\r\nask for "red mouth"; if you want betel-leaf, you may not say\r\nbetel-leaf (_dalu \'mun_), you must say _karon fenna._ In the same\r\nisland it is also taboo to mention the name of an elder brother in\r\nhis presence. Transgressions of these rules are punished with fines.\r\nIn Sunda it is thought that a particular crop would be spoilt if a\r\nman were to mention the names of his father and mother.\r\n\r\nAmong the Nufoors of Dutch New Guinea persons who are related to\r\neach other by marriage are forbidden to mention each other\'s names.\r\nAmong the connexions whose names are thus tabooed are wife,\r\nmother-in-law, father-in-law, your wife\'s uncles and aunts and also\r\nher grand-uncles and grand-aunts, and the whole of your wife\'s or\r\nyour husband\'s family in the same generation as yourself, except\r\nthat men may mention the names of their brothers-in-law, though\r\nwomen may not. The taboo comes into operation as soon as the\r\nbetrothal has taken place and before the marriage has been\r\ncelebrated. Families thus connected by the betrothal of two of their\r\nmembers are not only forbidden to pronounce each other\'s names; they\r\nmay not even look at each other, and the rule gives rise to the most\r\ncomical scenes when they happen to meet unexpectedly. And not merely\r\nthe names themselves, but any words that sound like them are\r\nscrupulously avoided and other words used in their place. If it\r\nshould chance that a person has inadvertently uttered a forbidden\r\nname, he must at once throw himself on the floor and say, "I have\r\nmentioned a wrong name. I throw it through the chinks of the floor\r\nin order that I may eat well."\r\n\r\nIn the western islands of Torres Straits a man never mentioned the\r\npersonal names of his father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law,\r\nand sister-in-law; and a woman was subject to the same restrictions.\r\nA brother-in-law might be spoken of as the husband or brother of\r\nsome one whose name it was lawful to mention; and similarly a\r\nsister-in-law might be called the wife of So-and-so. If a man by\r\nchance used the personal name of his brother-in-law, he was ashamed\r\nand hung his head. His shame was only relieved when he had made a\r\npresent as compensation to the man whose name he had taken in vain.\r\nThe same compensation was made to a sister-in-law, a father-in-law,\r\nand a mother-in-law for the accidental mention of their names. Among\r\nthe natives who inhabit the coast of the Gazelle Peninsula in New\r\nBritain to mention the name of a brother-in-law is the grossest\r\npossible affront you can offer to him; it is a crime punishable with\r\ndeath. In the Banks\' Islands, Melanesia, the taboos laid on the\r\nnames of persons connected by marriage are very strict. A man will\r\nnot mention the name of his father-in-law, much less the name of his\r\nmother-in-law, nor may he name his wife\'s brother; but he may name\r\nhis wife\'s sister--she is nothing to him. A woman may not name her\r\nfather-in-law, nor on any account her son-in-law. Two people whose\r\nchildren have intermarried are also debarred from mentioning each\r\nother\'s names. And not only are all these persons forbidden to utter\r\neach other\'s names; they may not even pronounce ordinary words which\r\nchance to be either identical with these names or to have any\r\nsyllables in common with them. Thus we hear of a native of these\r\nislands who might not use the common words for "pig" and "to die,"\r\nbecause these words occurred in the polysyllabic name of his\r\nson-in-law; and we are told of another unfortunate who might not\r\npronounce the everyday words for "hand" and "hot" on account of his\r\nwife\'s brother\'s name, and who was even debarred from mentioning the\r\nnumber "one," because the word for "one" formed part of the name of\r\nhis wife\'s cousin.\r\n\r\nThe reluctance to mention the names or even syllables of the names\r\nof persons connected with the speaker by marriage can hardly be\r\nseparated from the reluctance evinced by so many people to utter\r\ntheir own names or the names of the dead or of the dead or of chiefs\r\nand kings; and if the reticence as to these latter names springs\r\nmainly from superstition, we may infer that the reticence as to the\r\nformer has no better foundation. That the savage\'s unwillingness to\r\nmention his own name is based, at least in part, on a superstitious\r\nfear of the ill use that might be made of it by his foes, whether\r\nhuman or spiritual, has already been shown. It remains to examine\r\nthe similar usage in regard to the names of the dead and of royal\r\npersonages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Names of the Dead tabooed\r\n\r\nTHE CUSTOM of abstaining from all mention of the names of the dead\r\nwas observed in antiquity by the Albanians of the Caucasus, and at\r\nthe present day it is in full force among many savage tribes. Thus\r\nwe are told that one of the customs most rigidly observed and\r\nenforced amongst the Australian aborigines is never to mention the\r\nname of a deceased person, whether male or female; to name aloud one\r\nwho has departed this life would be a gross violation of their most\r\nsacred prejudices, and they carefully abstain from it. The chief\r\nmotive for this abstinence appears to be a fear of evoking the\r\nghost, although the natural unwillingness to revive past sorrows\r\nundoubtedly operates also to draw the veil of oblivion over the\r\nnames of the dead. Once Mr. Oldfield so terrified a native by\r\nshouting out the name of a deceased person, that the man fairly took\r\nto his heels and did not venture to show himself again for several\r\ndays. At their next meeting he bitterly reproached the rash white\r\nman for his indiscretion; "nor could I," adds Mr. Oldfield, "induce\r\nhim by any means to utter the awful sound of a dead man\'s name, for\r\nby so doing he would have placed himself in the power of the malign\r\nspirits." Among the aborigines of Victoria the dead were very rarely\r\nspoken of, and then never by their names; they were referred to in a\r\nsubdued voice as "the lost one" or "the poor fellow that is no\r\nmore." To speak of them by name would, it was supposed, excite the\r\nmalignity of Couit-gil, the spirit of the departed, which hovers on\r\nearth for a time before it departs for ever towards the setting sun.\r\nOf the tribes on the Lower Murray River we are told that when a\r\nperson dies "they carefully avoid mentioning his name; but if\r\ncompelled to do so, they pronounce it in a very low whisper, so\r\nfaint that they imagine the spirit cannot hear their voice." Amongst\r\nthe tribes of Central Australia no one may utter the name of the\r\ndeceased during the period of mourning, unless it is absolutely\r\nnecessary to do so, and then it is only done in a whisper for fear\r\nof disturbing and annoying the man\'s spirit which is walking about\r\nin ghostly form. If the ghost hears his name mentioned he concludes\r\nthat his kinsfolk are not mourning for him properly; if their grief\r\nwere genuine they could not bear to bandy his name about. Touched to\r\nthe quick by their hard-hearted indifference the indignant ghost\r\nwill come and trouble them in dreams.\r\n\r\nThe same reluctance to utter the names of the dead appears to\r\nprevail among all the Indian tribes of America from Hudson\'s Bay\r\nTerritory to Patagonia. Among the Goajiros of Colombia to mention\r\nthe dead before his kinsmen is a dreadful offence, which is often\r\npunished with death; for if it happens on the _rancho_ of the\r\ndeceased, in presence of his nephew or uncle, they will assuredly\r\nkill the offender on the spot if they can. But if he escapes, the\r\npenalty resolves itself into a heavy fine, usually of two or more\r\noxen.\r\n\r\nA similar reluctance to mention the names of the dead is reported of\r\npeoples so widely separated from each other as the Samoyeds of\r\nSiberia and the Todas of Southern India; the Mongols of Tartary and\r\nthe Tuaregs of the Sahara; the Ainos of Japan and the Akamba and\r\nNandi of Eastern Africa; the Tinguianes of the Philippines and the\r\ninhabitants of the Nicobar Islands, of Borneo, of Madagascar, and of\r\nTasmania. In all cases, even where it is not expressly stated, the\r\nfundamental reason for this avoidance is probably the fear of the\r\nghost. That this is the real motive with the Tuaregs we are\r\npositively informed. They dread the return of the dead man\'s spirit,\r\nand do all they can to avoid it by shifting their camp after a\r\ndeath, ceasing for ever to pronounce the name of the departed, and\r\neschewing everything that might be regarded as an evocation or\r\nrecall of his soul. Hence they do not, like the Arabs, designate\r\nindividuals by adding to their personal names the names of their\r\nfathers; they never speak of So-and-so, son of So-and-so; they give\r\nto every man a name which will live and die with him. So among some\r\nof the Victorian tribes in Australia personal names were rarely\r\nperpetuated, because the natives believed that any one who adopted\r\nthe name of a deceased person would not live long; probably his\r\nghostly namesake was supposed to come and fetch him away to the\r\nspirit-land.\r\n\r\nThe same fear of the ghost, which moves people to suppress his old\r\nname, naturally leads all persons who bear a similar name to\r\nexchange it for another, lest its utterance should attract the\r\nattention of the ghost, who cannot reasonably be expected to\r\ndiscriminate between all the different applications of the same\r\nname. Thus we are told that in the Adelaide and Encounter Bay tribes\r\nof South Australia the repugnance to mentioning the names of those\r\nwho have died lately is carried so far, that persons who bear the\r\nsame name as the deceased abandon it, and either adopt temporary\r\nnames or are known by any others that happen to belong to them. A\r\nsimilar custom prevails among some of the Queensland tribes; but the\r\nprohibition to use the names of the dead is not permanent, though it\r\nmay last for many years. In some Australian tribes the change of\r\nname thus brought about is permanent; the old name is laid aside for\r\never, and the man is known by his new name for the rest of his life,\r\nor at least until he is obliged to change it again for a like\r\nreason. Among the North American Indians all persons, whether men or\r\nwomen, who bore the name of one who had just died were obliged to\r\nabandon it and to adopt other names, which was formally done at the\r\nfirst ceremony of mourning for the dead. In some tribes to the east\r\nof the Rocky Mountains this change of name lasted only during the\r\nseason of mourning, but in other tribes on the Pacific Coast of\r\nNorth America it seems to have been permanent.\r\n\r\nSometimes by an extension of the same reasoning all the near\r\nrelations of the deceased change their names, whatever they may\r\nhappen to be, doubtless from a fear that the sound of the familiar\r\nnames might lure back the vagrant spirit to its old home. Thus in\r\nsome Victorian tribes the ordinary names of all the next of kin were\r\ndisused during the period of mourning, and certain general terms,\r\nprescribed by custom, were substituted for them. To call a mourner\r\nby his own name was considered an insult to the departed, and often\r\nled to fighting and bloodshed. Among Indian tribes of North-western\r\nAmerica near relations of the deceased often change their names\r\n"under an impression that spirits will be attracted back to earth if\r\nthey hear familiar names often repeated." Among the Kiowa Indians\r\nthe name of the dead is never spoken in the presence of the\r\nrelatives, and on the death of any member of a family all the others\r\ntake new names. This custom was noted by Raleigh\'s colonists on\r\nRoanoke Island more than three centuries ago. Among the Lengua\r\nIndians not only is a dead man\'s name never mentioned, but all the\r\nsurvivors change their names also. They say that Death has been\r\namong them and has carried off a list of the living, and that he\r\nwill soon come back for more victims; hence in order to defeat his\r\nfell purpose they change their names, believing that on his return\r\nDeath, though he has got them all on his list, will not be able to\r\nidentify them under their new names, and will depart to pursue the\r\nsearch elsewhere. Nicobarese mourners take new names in order to\r\nescape the unwelcome attentions of the ghost; and for the same\r\npurpose they disguise themselves by shaving their heads so that the\r\nghost is unable to recognise them.\r\n\r\nFurther, when the name of the deceased happens to be that of some\r\ncommon object, such as an animal, or plant, or fire, or water, it is\r\nsometimes considered necessary to drop that word in ordinary speech\r\nand replace it by another. A custom of this sort, it is plain, may\r\neasily be a potent agent of change in language; for where it\r\nprevails to any considerable extent many words must constantly\r\nbecome obsolete and new ones spring up. And this tendency has been\r\nremarked by observers who have recorded the custom in Australia,\r\nAmerica, and elsewhere. For example, with regard to the Australian\r\naborigines it has been noted that "the dialects change with almost\r\nevery tribe. Some tribes name their children after natural objects;\r\nand when the person so named dies, the word is never again\r\nmentioned; another word has therefore to be invented for the object\r\nafter which the child was called." The writer gives as an instance\r\nthe case of a man whose name Karla signified "fire"; when Karla\r\ndied, a new word for fire had to be introduced. "Hence," adds the\r\nwriter, "the language is always changing." Again, in the Encounter\r\nBay tribe of South Australia, if a man of the name of Ngnke, which\r\nmeans "water," were to die, the whole tribe would be obliged to use\r\nsome other word to express water for a considerable time after his\r\ndecease. The writer who records this custom surmises that it may\r\nexplain the presence of a number of synonyms in the language of the\r\ntribe. This conjecture is confirmed by what we know of some\r\nVictorian tribes whose speech comprised a regular set of synonyms to\r\nbe used instead of the common terms by all members of a tribe in\r\ntimes of mourning. For instance, if a man called Waa ( "crow")\r\ndeparted this life, during the period of mourning for him nobody\r\nmight call a crow a _waa;_ everybody had to speak of the bird as a\r\n_narrapart._ When a person who rejoiced in the title of Ringtail\r\nOpossum (_weearn_) had gone the way of all flesh, his sorrowing\r\nrelations and the tribe at large were bound for a time to refer to\r\nringtail opossums by the more sonorous name of _manuungkuurt._ If\r\nthe community were plunged in grief for the loss of a respected\r\nfemale who bore the honourable name of Turkey Bustard, the proper\r\nname for turkey bustards, which was _barrim barrim,_ went out, and\r\n_tillit tilliitsh_ came in. And so _mutatis mutandis_ with the names\r\nof Black Cockatoo, Grey Duck, Gigantic Crane, Kangaroo, Eagle,\r\nDingo, and the rest.\r\n\r\nA similar custom used to be constantly transforming the language of\r\nthe Abipones of Paraguay, amongst whom, however, a word once\r\nabolished seems never to have been revived. New words, says the\r\nmissionary Dobrizhoffer, sprang up every year like mushrooms in a\r\nnight, because all words that resembled the names of the dead were\r\nabolished by proclamation and others coined in their place. The mint\r\nof words was in the hands of the old women of the tribe, and\r\nwhatever term they stamped with their approval and put in\r\ncirculation was immediately accepted without a murmur by high and\r\nlow alike, and spread like wildfire through every camp and\r\nsettlement of the tribe. You would be astonished, says the same\r\nmissionary, to see how meekly the whole nation acquiesces in the\r\ndecision of a withered old hag, and how completely the old familiar\r\nwords fall instantly out of use and are never repeated either\r\nthrough force of habit or forgetfulness. In the seven years that\r\nDobrizhoffer spent among these Indians the native word for jaguar\r\nwas changed thrice, and the words for crocodile, thorn, and the\r\nslaughter of cattle underwent similar though less varied\r\nvicissitudes. As a result of this habit, the vocabularies of the\r\nmissionaries teemed with erasures, old words having constantly to be\r\nstruck out as obsolete and new ones inserted in their place. In many\r\ntribes of British New Guinea the names of persons are also the names\r\nof common things. The people believe that if the name of a deceased\r\nperson is pronounced, his spirit will return, and as they have no\r\nwish to see it back among them the mention of his name is tabooed\r\nand a new word is created to take its place, whenever the name\r\nhappens to be a common term of the language. Consequently many words\r\nare permanently lost or revived with modified or new meanings. In\r\nthe Nicobar Islands a similar practice has similarly affected the\r\nspeech of the natives. "A most singular custom," says Mr. de\r\nRoepstorff, "prevails among them which one would suppose must most\r\neffectually hinder the \'making of history,\' or, at any rate, the\r\ntransmission of historical narrative. By a strict rule, which has\r\nall the sanction of Nicobar superstition, no man\'s name may be\r\nmentioned after his death! To such a length is this carried that\r\nwhen, as very frequently happens, the man rejoiced in the name of\r\n\'Fowl,\' \'Hat\', \'Fire,\' \'Road,\' etc., in its Nicobarese equivalent,\r\nthe use of these words is carefully eschewed for the future, not\r\nonly as being the personal designation of the deceased, but even as\r\nthe names of the common things they represent; the words die out of\r\nthe language, and either new vocables are coined to express the\r\nthing intended, or a substitute for the disused word is found in\r\nother Nicobarese dialects or in some foreign tongue. This\r\nextraordinary custom not only adds an element of instability to the\r\nlanguage, but destroys the continuity of political life, and renders\r\nthe record of past events precarious and vague, if not impossible."\r\n\r\nThat a superstition which suppresses the names of the dead must cut\r\nat the very root of historical tradition has been remarked by other\r\nworkers in this field. "The Klamath people," observes Mr. A. S.\r\nGatschet, "possess no historic traditions going further back in time\r\nthan a century, for the simple reason that there was a strict law\r\nprohibiting the mention of the person or acts of a deceased\r\nindividual by _using his name._ This law was rigidly observed among\r\nthe Californians no less than among the Oregonians, and on its\r\ntransgression the death penalty could be inflicted. This is\r\ncertainly enough to suppress all historical knowledge within a\r\npeople. How can history be written without names?"\r\n\r\nIn many tribes, however, the power of this superstition to blot out\r\nthe memory of the past is to some extent weakened and impaired by a\r\nnatural tendency of the human mind. Time, which wears out the\r\ndeepest impressions, inevitably dulls, if it does not wholly efface,\r\nthe print left on the savage mind by the mystery and horror of\r\ndeath. Sooner or later, as the memory of his loved ones fades slowly\r\naway, he becomes more willing to speak of them, and thus their rude\r\nnames may sometimes be rescued by the philosophic enquirer before\r\nthey have vanished, like autumn leaves or winter snows, into the\r\nvast undistinguished limbo of the past. In some of the Victorian\r\ntribes the prohibition to mention the names of the dead remained in\r\nforce only during the period of mourning; in the Port Lincoln tribe\r\nof South Australia it lasted many years. Among the Chinook Indians\r\nof North America "custom forbids the mention of a dead man\'s name,\r\nat least till many years have elapsed after the bereavement." Among\r\nthe Puyallup Indians the observance of the taboo is relaxed after\r\nseveral years, when the mourners have forgotten their grief; and if\r\nthe deceased was a famous warrior, one of his descendants, for\r\ninstance a great-grandson, may be named after him. In this tribe the\r\ntaboo is not much observed at any time except by the relations of\r\nthe dead. Similarly the Jesuit missionary Lafitau tells us that the\r\nname of the departed and the similar names of the survivors were, so\r\nto say, buried with the corpse until, the poignancy of their grief\r\nbeing abated, it pleased the relations "to lift up the tree and\r\nraise the dead." By raising the dead they meant bestowing the name\r\nof the departed upon some one else, who thus became to all intents\r\nand purposes a reincarnation of the deceased, since on the\r\nprinciples of savage philosophy the name is a vital part, if not the\r\nsoul, of the man.\r\n\r\nAmong the Lapps, when a woman was with child and near the time of\r\nher delivery, a deceased ancestor or relation used to appear to her\r\nin a dream and inform her what dead person was to be born again in\r\nher infant, and whose name the child was therefore to bear. If the\r\nwoman had no such dream, it fell to the father or the relatives to\r\ndetermine the name by divination or by consulting a wizard. Among\r\nthe Khonds a birth is celebrated on the seventh day after the event\r\nby a feast given to the priest and to the whole village. To\r\ndetermine the child\'s name the priest drops grains of rice into a\r\ncup of water, naming with each grain a deceased ancestor. From the\r\nmovements of the seed in the water, and from observations made on\r\nthe person of the infant, he pronounces which of his progenitors has\r\nreappeared in him, and the child generally, at least among the\r\nnorthern tribes, receives the name of that ancestor. Among the\r\nYorubas, soon after a child has been born, a priest of Ifa, the god\r\nof divination, appears on the scene to ascertain what ancestral soul\r\nhas been reborn in the infant. As soon as this has been decided, the\r\nparents are told that the child must conform in all respects to the\r\nmanner of life of the ancestor who now animates him or her, and if,\r\nas often happens, they profess ignorance, the priest supplies the\r\nnecessary information. The child usually receives the name of the\r\nancestor who has been born again in him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Names of Kings and other Sacred Persons tabooed\r\n\r\nWHEN we see that in primitive society the names of mere commoners,\r\nwhether alive or dead, are matters of such anxious care, we need not\r\nbe surprised that great precautions should be taken to guard from\r\nharm the names of sacred kings and priests. Thus the name of the\r\nking of Dahomey is always kept secret, lest the knowledge of it\r\nshould enable some evil-minded person to do him a mischief. The\r\nappellations by which the different kings of Dahomey have been known\r\nto Europeans are not their true names, but mere titles, or what the\r\nnatives call "strong names." The natives seem to think that no harm\r\ncomes of such titles being known, since they are not, like the\r\nbirth-names, vitally connected with their owners. In the Galla\r\nkingdom of Ghera the birth-name of the sovereign may not be\r\npronounced by a subject under pain of death, and common words which\r\nresemble it in sound are changed for others. Among the Bahima of\r\nCentral Africa, when the king dies, his name is abolished from the\r\nlanguage, and if his name was that of an animal, a new appellation\r\nmust be found for the creature at once. For example, the king is\r\noften called a lion; hence at the death of a king named Lion a new\r\nname for lions in general has to be coined. In Siam it used to be\r\ndifficult to ascertain the king\'s real name, since it was carefully\r\nkept secret from fear of sorcery; any one who mentioned it was\r\nclapped into gaol. The king might only be referred to under certain\r\nhigh-sounding titles, such as "the august," "the perfect," "the\r\nsupreme," "the great emperor," "descendant of the angels," and so\r\non. In Burma it was accounted an impiety of the deepest dye to\r\nmention the name of the reigning sovereign; Burmese subjects, even\r\nwhen they were far from their country, could not be prevailed upon\r\nto do so; after his accession to the throne the king was known by\r\nhis royal titles only.\r\n\r\nAmong the Zulus no man will mention the name of the chief of his\r\ntribe or the names of the progenitors of the chief, so far as he can\r\nremember them; nor will he utter common words which coincide with or\r\nmerely resemble in sound tabooed names. In the tribe of the Dwandwes\r\nthere was a chief called Langa, which means the sun; hence the name\r\nof the sun was changed from _langa_ to _gala,_ and so remains to\r\nthis day, though Langa died more than a hundred years ago. Again, in\r\nthe Xnumayo tribe the word meaning "to herd cattle" was changed from\r\n_alusa or ayusa_ to _kagesa,_ because u-Mayusi was the name of the\r\nchief. Besides these taboos, which were observed by each tribe\r\nseparately, all the Zulu tribes united in tabooing the name of the\r\nking who reigned over the whole nation. Hence, for example, when\r\nPanda was king of Zululand, the word for "a root of a tree," which\r\nis _impando,_ was changed to _nxabo._ Again, the word for "lies" or\r\n"slander" was altered from _amacebo_ to _amakwata,_ because\r\n_amacebo_ contains a syllable of the name of the famous King\r\nCetchwayo. These substitutions are not, however, carried so far by\r\nthe men as by the women, who omit every sound even remotely\r\nresembling one that occurs in a tabooed name. At the king\'s kraal,\r\nindeed, it is sometimes difficult to understand the speech of the\r\nroyal wives, as they treat in this fashion the names not only of the\r\nking and his forefathers, but even of his and their brothers back\r\nfor generations. When to these tribal and national taboos we add\r\nthose family taboos on the names of connexions by marriage which\r\nhave been already described, we can easily understand how it comes\r\nabout that in Zululand every tribe has words peculiar to itself, and\r\nthat the women have a considerable vocabulary of their own. Members,\r\ntoo, of one family may be debarred from using words employed by\r\nthose of another. The women of one kraal, for instance, may call a\r\nhyaena by its ordinary name; those of the next may use the common\r\nsubstitute; while in a third the substitute may also be unlawful and\r\nanother term may have to be invented to supply its place. Hence the\r\nZulu language at the present day almost presents the appearance of\r\nbeing a double one; indeed, for multitudes of things it possesses\r\nthree or four synonyms, which through the blending of tribes are\r\nknown all over Zululand.\r\n\r\nIn Madagascar a similar custom everywhere prevails and has resulted,\r\nas among the Zulus, in producing certain dialectic differences in\r\nthe speech of the various tribes. There are no family names in\r\nMadagascar, and almost every personal name is drawn from the\r\nlanguage of daily life and signifies some common object or action or\r\nquality, such as a bird, a beast, a tree, a plant, a colour, and so\r\non. Now, whenever one of these common words forms the name or part\r\nof the name of the chief of the tribe, it becomes sacred and may no\r\nlonger be used in its ordinary signification as the name of a tree,\r\nan insect, or what not. Hence a new name for the object must be\r\ninvented to replace the one which has been discarded. It is easy to\r\nconceive what confusion and uncertainty may thus be introduced into\r\na language when it is spoken by many little local tribes each ruled\r\nby a petty chief with his own sacred name. Yet there are tribes and\r\npeople who submit to this tyranny of words as their fathers did\r\nbefore them from time immemorial. The inconvenient results of the\r\ncustom are especially marked on the western coast of the island,\r\nwhere, on account of the large number of independent chieftains, the\r\nnames of things, places, and rivers have suffered so many changes\r\nthat confusion often arises, for when once common words have been\r\nbanned by the chiefs the natives will not acknowledge to have ever\r\nknown them in their old sense.\r\n\r\nBut it is not merely the names of living kings and chiefs which are\r\ntabooed in Madagascar; the names of dead sovereigns are equally\r\nunder a ban, at least in some parts of the island. Thus among the\r\nSakalavas, when a king has died, the nobles and people meet in\r\ncouncil round the dead body and solemnly choose a new name by which\r\nthe deceased monarch shall be henceforth known. After the new name\r\nhas been adopted, the old name by which the king was known during\r\nhis life becomes sacred and may not be pronounced under pain of\r\ndeath. Further, words in the common language which bear any\r\nresemblance to the forbidden name also become sacred and have to be\r\nreplaced by others. Persons who uttered these forbidden words were\r\nlooked on not only as grossly rude, but even as felons; they had\r\ncommitted a capital crime. However, these changes of vocabulary are\r\nconfined to the district over which the deceased king reigned; in\r\nthe neighbouring districts the old words continue to be employed in\r\nthe old sense.\r\n\r\nThe sanctity attributed to the persons of chiefs in Polynesia\r\nnaturally extended also to their names, which on the primitive view\r\nare hardly separable from the personality of their owners. Hence in\r\nPolynesia we find the same systematic prohibition to utter the names\r\nof chiefs or of common words resembling them which we have already\r\nmet with in Zululand and Madagascar. Thus in New Zealand the name of\r\na chief is held so sacred that, when it happens to be a common word,\r\nit may not be used in the language, and another has to be found to\r\nreplace it. For example, a chief of the southward of East Cape bore\r\nthe name of Maripi, which signified a knife, hence a new word\r\n(_nekra_) for knife was introduced, and the old one became obsolete.\r\nElsewhere the word for water (_wai_) had to be changed, because it\r\nchanced to be the name of the chief, and would have been desecrated\r\nby being applied to the vulgar fluid as well as to his sacred\r\nperson. This taboo naturally produced a plentiful crop of synonyms\r\nin the Maori language, and travellers newly arrived in the country\r\nwere sometimes puzzled at finding the same things called by quite\r\ndifferent names in neighbouring tribes. When a king comes to the\r\nthrone in Tahiti, any words in the language that resemble his name\r\nin sound must be changed for others. In former times, if any man\r\nwere so rash as to disregard this custom and to use the forbidden\r\nwords, not only he but all his relations were immediately put to\r\ndeath. But the changes thus introduced were only temporary; on the\r\ndeath of the king the new words fell into disuse, and the original\r\nones were revived.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Greece the names of the priests and other high officials\r\nwho had to do with the performance of the Eleusinian mysteries might\r\nnot be uttered in their lifetime. To pronounce them was a legal\r\noffence The pedant in Lucian tells how he fell in with these august\r\npersonages haling along to the police court a ribald fellow who had\r\ndared to name them, though well he knew that ever since their\r\nconsecration it was unlawful to do so, because they had become\r\nanonymous, having lost their old names and acquired new and sacred\r\ntitles. From two inscriptions found at Eleusis it appears that the\r\nnames of the priests were committed to the depths of the sea;\r\nprobably they were engraved on tablets of bronze or lead, which were\r\nthen thrown into deep water in the Gulf of Salamis. The intention\r\ndoubtless was to keep the names a profound secret; and how could\r\nthat be done more surely than by sinking them in the sea? what human\r\nvision could spy them glimmering far down in the dim depths of the\r\ngreen water? A clearer illustration of the confusion between the\r\nincorporeal and the corporeal, between the name and its material\r\nembodiment, could hardly be found than in this practice of civilised\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Names of Gods tabooed\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE man creates his gods in his own image. Xenophanes remarked\r\nlong ago that the complexion of negro gods was black and their noses\r\nflat; that Thracian gods were ruddy and blue-eyed; and that if\r\nhorses, oxen, and lions only believed in gods and had hands\r\nwherewith to portray them, they would doubtless fashion their\r\ndeities in the form of horses, and oxen, and lions. Hence just as\r\nthe furtive savage conceals his real name because he fears that\r\nsorcerers might make an evil use of it, so he fancies that his gods\r\nmust likewise keep their true name secret, lest other gods or even\r\nmen should learn the mystic sounds and thus be able to conjure with\r\nthem. Nowhere was this crude conception of the secrecy and magical\r\nvirtue of the divine name more firmly held or more fully developed\r\nthan in ancient Egypt, where the superstitions of a dateless past\r\nwere embalmed in the hearts of the people hardly less effectually\r\nthan the bodies of cats and crocodiles and the rest of the divine\r\nmenagerie in their rock-cut tombs. The conception is well\r\nillustrated by a story which tells how the subtle Isis wormed his\r\nsecret name from Ra, the great Egyptian god of the sun. Isis, so\r\nruns the tale, was a woman mighty in words, and she was weary of the\r\nworld of men, and yearned after the world of the gods. And she\r\nmeditated in her heart, saying, "Cannot I by virtue of the great\r\nname of Ra make myself a goddess and reign like him in heaven and\r\nearth?" For Ra had many names, but the great name which gave him all\r\npower over gods and men was known to none but himself. Now the god\r\nwas by this time grown old; he slobbered at the mouth and his\r\nspittle fell upon the ground. So Isis gathered up the spittle and\r\nthe earth with it, and kneaded thereof a serpent and laid it in the\r\npath where the great god passed every day to his double kingdom\r\nafter his heart\'s desire. And when he came forth according to his\r\nwont, attended by all his company of gods, the sacred serpent stung\r\nhim, and the god opened his mouth and cried, and his cry went up to\r\nheaven. And the company of gods cried, "What aileth thee?" and the\r\ngods shouted, "Lo and behold!" But he could not answer; his jaws\r\nrattled, his limbs shook, the poison ran through his flesh as the\r\nNile floweth over the land. When the great god had stilled his\r\nheart, he cried to his followers, "Come to me, O my children,\r\noffspring of my body. I am a prince, the son of a prince, the divine\r\nseed of a god. My father devised my name; my father and my mother\r\ngave me my name, and it remained hidden in my body since my birth,\r\nthat no magician might have magic power over me. I went out to\r\nbehold that which I have made, I walked in the two lands which I\r\nhave created, and lo! something stung me. What it was, I know not.\r\nWas it fire? was it water? My heart is on fire, my flesh trembleth,\r\nall my limbs do quake. Bring me the children of the gods with\r\nhealing words and understanding lips, whose power reacheth to\r\nheaven." Then came to him the children of the gods, and they were\r\nvery sorrowful. And Isis came with her craft, whose mouth is full of\r\nthe breath of life, whose spells chase pain away, whose word maketh\r\nthe dead to live. She said, "What is it, divine Father? what is it?"\r\nThe holy god opened his mouth, he spake and said, "I went upon my\r\nway, I walked after my heart\'s desire in the two regions which I\r\nhave made to behold that which I have created, and lo! a serpent\r\nthat I saw not stung me. Is it fire? is it water? I am colder than\r\nwater, I am hotter than fire, all my limbs sweat, I tremble, mine\r\neye is not steadfast, I behold not the sky, the moisture bedeweth my\r\nface as in summer-time." Then spake Isis, "Tell me thy name, divine\r\nFather, for the man shall live who is called by his name." Then\r\nanswered Ra, "I created the heavens and the earth, I ordered the\r\nmountains, I made the great and wide sea, I stretched out the two\r\nhorizons like a curtain. I am he who openeth his eyes and it is\r\nlight, and who shutteth them and it is dark. At his command the Nile\r\nriseth, but the gods know not his name. I am Khepera in the morning,\r\nI am Ra at noon, I am Tum at eve." But the poison was not taken away\r\nfrom him; it pierced deeper, and the great god could no longer walk.\r\nThen said Isis to him, "That was not thy name that thou spakest unto\r\nme. Oh tell it me, that the poison may depart; for he shall live\r\nwhose name is named." Now the poison burned like fire, it was hotter\r\nthan the flame of fire. The god said, "I consent that Isis shall\r\nsearch into me, and that my name shall pass from my breast into\r\nhers." Then the god hid himself from the gods, and his place in the\r\nship of eternity was empty. Thus was the name of the great god taken\r\nfrom him, and Isis, the witch, spake, "Flow away, poison, depart\r\nfrom Ra. It is I, even I, who overcome the poison and cast it to the\r\nearth; for the name of the great god hath been taken away from him.\r\nLet Ra live and let the poison die." Thus spake great Isis, the\r\nqueen of the gods, she who knows Ra and his true name.\r\n\r\nFrom this story it appears that the real name of the god, with which\r\nhis power was inextricably bound up, was supposed to be lodged, in\r\nan almost physical sense, somewhere in his breast, from which Isis\r\nextracted it by a sort of surgical operation and transferred it with\r\nall its supernatural powers to herself. In Egypt attempts like that\r\nof Isis to appropriate the power of a high god by possessing herself\r\nof his name were not mere legends told of the mythical beings of a\r\nremote past; every Egyptian magician aspired to wield like powers by\r\nsimilar means. For it was believed that he who possessed the true\r\nname possessed the very being of god or man, and could force even a\r\ndeity to obey him as a slave obeys his master. Thus the art of the\r\nmagician consisted in obtaining from the gods a revelation of their\r\nsacred names, and he left no stone unturned to accomplish his end.\r\nWhen once a god in a moment of weakness or forgetfulness had\r\nimparted to the wizard the wondrous lore, the deity had no choice\r\nbut to submit humbly to the man or pay the penalty of his contumacy.\r\n\r\nThe belief in the magic virtue of divine names was shared by the\r\nRomans. When they sat down before a city, the priests addressed the\r\nguardian deity of the place in a set form of prayer or incantation,\r\ninviting him to abandon the beleaguered city and come over to the\r\nRomans, who would treat him as well as or better than he had ever\r\nbeen treated in his old home. Hence the name of the guardian deity\r\nof Rome was kept a profound secret, lest the enemies of the republic\r\nmight lure him away, even as the Romans themselves had induced many\r\ngods to desert, like rats, the falling fortunes of cities that had\r\nsheltered them in happier days. Nay, the real name, not merely of\r\nits guardian deity, but of the city itself, was wrapt in mystery and\r\nmight never be uttered, not even in the sacred rites. A certain\r\nValerius Soranus, who dared to divulge the priceless secret, was put\r\nto death or came to a bad end. In like manner, it seems, the ancient\r\nAssyrians were forbidden to mention the mystic names of their\r\ncities; and down to modern times the Cheremiss of the Caucasus keep\r\nthe names of their communal villages secret from motives of\r\nsuperstition.\r\n\r\nIf the reader has had the patience to follow this examination of the\r\nsuperstitions attaching to personal names, he will probably agree\r\nthat the mystery in which the names of royal personages are so often\r\nshrouded is no isolated phenomenon, no arbitrary expression of\r\ncourtly servility and adulation, but merely the particular\r\napplication of a general law of primitive thought, which includes\r\nwithin its scope common folk and gods as well as kings and priests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII. Our Debt to the Savage\r\n\r\nIT would be easy to extend the list of royal and priestly taboos,\r\nbut the instances collected in the preceding pages may suffice as\r\nspecimens. To conclude this part of our subject it only remains to\r\nstate summarily the general conclusions to which our enquiries have\r\nthus far conducted us. We have seen that in savage or barbarous\r\nsociety there are often found men to whom the superstition of their\r\nfellows ascribes a controlling influence over the general course of\r\nnature. Such men are accordingly adored and treated as gods. Whether\r\nthese human divinities also hold temporal sway over the lives and\r\nfortunes of their adorers, or whether their functions are purely\r\nspiritual and supernatural, in other words, whether they are kings\r\nas well as gods or only the latter, is a distinction which hardly\r\nconcerns us here. Their supposed divinity is the essential fact with\r\nwhich we have to deal. In virtue of it they are a pledge and\r\nguarantee to their worshippers of the continuance and orderly\r\nsuccession of those physical phenomena upon which mankind depends\r\nfor subsistence. Naturally, therefore, the life and health of such a\r\ngod-man are matters of anxious concern to the people whose welfare\r\nand even existence are bound up with his; naturally he is\r\nconstrained by them to conform to such rules as the wit of early man\r\nhas devised for averting the ills to which flesh is heir, including\r\nthe last ill, death. These rules, as an examination of them has\r\nshown, are nothing but the maxims with which, on the primitive view,\r\nevery man of common prudence must comply if he would live long in\r\nthe land. But while in the case of ordinary men the observance of\r\nthe rules is left to the choice of the individual, in the case of\r\nthe god-man it is enforced under penalty of dismissal from his high\r\nstation, or even of death. For his worshippers have far too great a\r\nstake in his life to allow him to play fast and loose with it.\r\nTherefore all the quaint superstitions, the old-world maxims, the\r\nvenerable saws which the ingenuity of savage philosophers elaborated\r\nlong ago, and which old women at chimney corners still impart as\r\ntreasures of great price to their descendants gathered round the\r\ncottage fire on winter evenings--all these antique fancies\r\nclustered, all these cobwebs of the brain were spun about the path\r\nof the old king, the human god, who, immeshed in them like a fly in\r\nthe toils of a spider, could hardly stir a limb for the threads of\r\ncustom, "light as air but strong as links of iron," that crossing\r\nand recrossing each other in an endless maze bound him fast within a\r\nnetwork of observances from which death or deposition alone could\r\nrelease him.\r\n\r\nThus to students of the past the life of the old kings and priests\r\nteems with instruction. In it was summed up all that passed for\r\nwisdom when the world was young. It was the perfect pattern after\r\nwhich every man strove to shape his life; a faultless model\r\nconstructed with rigorous accuracy upon the lines laid down by a\r\nbarbarous philosophy. Crude and false as that philosophy may seem to\r\nus, it would be unjust to deny it the merit of logical consistency.\r\nStarting from a conception of the vital principle as a tiny being or\r\nsoul existing in, but distinct and separable from, the living being,\r\nit deduces for the practical guidance of life a system of rules\r\nwhich in general hangs well together and forms a fairly complete and\r\nharmonious whole. The flaw--and it is a fatal one--of the system\r\nlies not in its reasoning, but in its premises; in its conception of\r\nthe nature of life, not in any irrelevancy of the conclusions which\r\nit draws from that conception. But to stigmatise these premises as\r\nridiculous because we can easily detect their falseness, would be\r\nungrateful as well as unphilosophical. We stand upon the foundation\r\nreared by the generations that have gone before, and we can but\r\ndimly realise the painful and prolonged efforts which it has cost\r\nhumanity to struggle up to the point, no very exalted one after all,\r\nwhich we have reached. Our gratitude is due to the nameless and\r\nforgotten toilers, whose patient thought and active exertions have\r\nlargely made us what we are. The amount of new knowledge which one\r\nage, certainly which one man, can add to the common store is small,\r\nand it argues stupidity or dishonesty, besides ingratitude, to\r\nignore the heap while vaunting the few grains which it may have been\r\nour privilege to add to it. There is indeed little danger at present\r\nof undervaluing the contributions which modern times and even\r\nclassical antiquity have made to the general advancement of our\r\nrace. But when we pass these limits, the case is different. Contempt\r\nand ridicule or abhorrence and denunciation are too often the only\r\nrecognition vouchsafed to the savage and his ways. Yet of the\r\nbenefactors whom we are bound thankfully to commemorate, many,\r\nperhaps most, were savages. For when all is said and done our\r\nresemblances to the savage are still far more numerous than our\r\ndifferences from him; and what we have in common with him, and\r\ndeliberately retain as true and useful, we owe to our savage\r\nforefathers who slowly acquired by experience and transmitted to us\r\nby inheritance those seemingly fundamental ideas which we are apt to\r\nregard as original and intuitive. We are like heirs to a fortune\r\nwhich has been handed down for so many ages that the memory of those\r\nwho built it up is lost, and its possessors for the time being\r\nregard it as having been an original and unalterable possession of\r\ntheir race since the beginning of the world. But reflection and\r\nenquiry should satisfy us that to our predecessors we are indebted\r\nfor much of what we thought most our own, and that their errors were\r\nnot wilful extravagances or the ravings of insanity, but simply\r\nhypotheses, justifiable as such at the time when they were\r\npropounded, but which a fuller experience has proved to be\r\ninadequate. It is only by the successive testing of hypotheses and\r\nrejection of the false that truth is at last elicited. After all,\r\nwhat we call truth is only the hypothesis which is found to work\r\nbest. Therefore in reviewing the opinions and practices of ruder\r\nages and races we shall do well to look with leniency upon their\r\nerrors as inevitable slips made in the search for truth, and to give\r\nthem the benefit of that indulgence which we ourselves may one day\r\nstand in need of: _cum excusatione itaque veteres audiendi sunt._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV. The Killing of the Divine King\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Mortality of the Gods\r\n\r\nMAN has created gods in his own likeness and being himself mortal he\r\nhas naturally supposed his creatures to be in the same sad\r\npredicament. Thus the Greenlanders believed that a wind could kill\r\ntheir most powerful god, and that he would certainly die if he\r\ntouched a dog. When they heard of the Christian God, they kept\r\nasking if he never died, and being informed that he did not, they\r\nwere much surprised, and said that he must be a very great god\r\nindeed. In answer to the enquiries of Colonel Dodge, a North\r\nAmerican Indian stated that the world was made by the Great Spirit.\r\nBeing asked which Great Spirit he meant, the good one or the bad\r\none, "Oh, neither of _them,_" replied he, "the Great Spirit that\r\nmade the world is dead long ago. He could not possibly have lived as\r\nlong as this." A tribe in the Philippine Islands told the Spanish\r\nconquerors that the grave of the Creator was upon the top of Mount\r\nCabunian. Heitsi-eibib, a god or divine hero of the Hottentots, died\r\nseveral times and came to life again. His graves are generally to be\r\nmet with in narrow defiles between mountains. When the Hottentots\r\npass one of them, they throw a stone on it for good luck, sometimes\r\nmuttering, "Give us plenty of cattle." The grave of Zeus, the great\r\ngod of Greece, was shown to visitors in Crete as late as about the\r\nbeginning of our era. The body of Dionysus was buried at Delphi\r\nbeside the golden statue of Apollo, and his tomb bore the\r\ninscription, "Here lies Dionysus dead, the son of Semele." According\r\nto one account, Apollo himself was buried at Delphi; for Pythagoras\r\nis said to have carved an inscription on his tomb, setting forth how\r\nthe god had been killed by the python and buried under the tripod.\r\n\r\nThe great gods of Egypt themselves were not exempt from the common\r\nlot. They too grew old and died. But when at a later time the\r\ndiscovery of the art of embalming gave a new lease of life to the\r\nsouls of the dead by preserving their bodies for an indefinite time\r\nfrom corruption, the deities were permitted to share the benefit of\r\nan invention which held out to gods as well as to men a reasonable\r\nhope of immortality. Every province then had the tomb and mummy of\r\nits dead god. The mummy of Osiris was to be seen at Mendes; Thinis\r\nboasted of the mummy of Anhouri; and Heliopolis rejoiced in the\r\npossession of that of Toumou. The high gods of Babylon also, though\r\nthey appeared to their worshippers only in dreams and visions, were\r\nconceived to be human in their bodily shape, human in their\r\npassions, and human in their fate; for like men they were born into\r\nthe world, and like men they loved and fought and died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Kings killed when their Strength fails\r\n\r\nIF THE HIGH gods, who dwell remote from the fret and fever of this\r\nearthly life, are yet believed to die at last, it is not to be\r\nexpected that a god who lodges in a frail tabernacle of flesh should\r\nescape the same fate, though we hear of African kings who have\r\nimagined themselves immortal by virtue of their sorceries. Now\r\nprimitive peoples, as we have seen, sometimes believe that their\r\nsafety and even that of the world is bound up with the life of one\r\nof these god-men or human incarnations of the divinity. Naturally,\r\ntherefore, they take the utmost care of his life, out of a regard\r\nfor their own. But no amount of care and precaution will prevent the\r\nman-god from growing old and feeble and at last dying. His\r\nworshippers have to lay their account with this sad necessity and to\r\nmeet it as best they can. The danger is a formidable one; for if the\r\ncourse of nature is dependent on the man-god\'s life, what\r\ncatastrophes may not be expected from the gradual enfeeblement of\r\nhis powers and their final extinction in death? There is only one\r\nway of averting these dangers. The man-god must be killed as soon as\r\nhe shows symptoms that his powers are beginning to fail, and his\r\nsoul must be transferred to a vigorous successor before it has been\r\nseriously impaired by the threatened decay. The advantages of thus\r\nputting the man-god to death instead of allowing him to die of old\r\nage and disease are, to the savage, obvious enough. For if the\r\nman-god dies what we call a natural death, it means, according to\r\nthe savage, that his soul has either voluntarily departed from his\r\nbody and refuses to return, or more commonly that it has been\r\nextracted, or at least detained in its wanderings, by a demon or\r\nsorcerer. In any of these cases the soul of the man-god is lost to\r\nhis worshippers, and with it their prosperity is gone and their very\r\nexistence endangered. Even if they could arrange to catch the soul\r\nof the dying god as it left his lips or his nostrils and so transfer\r\nit to a successor, this would not effect their purpose; for, dying\r\nof disease, his soul would necessarily leave his body in the last\r\nstage of weakness and exhaustion, and so enfeebled it would continue\r\nto drag out a languid, inert existence in any body to which it might\r\nbe transferred. Whereas by slaying him his worshippers could, in the\r\nfirst place, make sure of catching his soul as it escaped and\r\ntransferring it to a suitable successor; and, in the second place,\r\nby putting him to death before his natural force was abated, they\r\nwould secure that the world should not fall into decay with the\r\ndecay of the man-god. Every purpose, therefore, was answered, and\r\nall dangers averted by thus killing the man-god and transferring his\r\nsoul, while yet at its prime, to a vigorous successor.\r\n\r\nThe mystic kings of Fire and Water in Cambodia are not allowed to\r\ndie a natural death. Hence when one of them is seriously ill and the\r\nelders think that he cannot recover, they stab him to death. The\r\npeople of Congo believed, as we have seen, that if their pontiff the\r\nChitom\xe9 were to die a natural death, the world would perish, and the\r\nearth, which he alone sustained by his power and merit, would\r\nimmediately be annihilated. Accordingly when he fell ill and seemed\r\nlikely to die, the man who was destined to be his successor entered\r\nthe pontiff\'s house with a rope or a club and strangled or clubbed\r\nhim to death. The Ethiopian kings of Meroe were worshipped as gods;\r\nbut whenever the priests chose, they sent a messenger to the king,\r\nordering him to die, and alleging an oracle of the gods as their\r\nauthority for the command. This command the kings always obeyed down\r\nto the reign of Ergamenes, a contemporary of Ptolemy II., King of\r\nEgypt. Having received a Greek education which emancipated him from\r\nthe superstitions of his countrymen, Ergamenes ventured to disregard\r\nthe command of the priests, and, entering the Golden Temple with a\r\nbody of soldiers, put the priests to the sword.\r\n\r\nCustoms of the same sort appear to have prevailed in this part of\r\nAfrica down to modern times. In some tribes of Fazoql the king had\r\nto administer justice daily under a certain tree. If from sickness\r\nor any other cause he was unable to discharge this duty for three\r\nwhole days, he was hanged on the tree in a noose, which contained\r\ntwo razors so arranged that when the noose was drawn tight by the\r\nweight of the king\'s body they cut his throat.\r\n\r\nA custom of putting their divine kings to death at the first\r\nsymptoms of infirmity or old age prevailed until lately, if indeed\r\nit is even now extinct and not merely dormant, among the Shilluk of\r\nthe White Nile, and in recent years it has been carefully\r\ninvestigated by Dr. C. G. Seligman. The reverence which the Shilluk\r\npay to their king appears to arise chiefly from the conviction that\r\nhe is a reincarnation of the spirit of Nyakang, the semi-divine hero\r\nwho founded the dynasty and settled the tribe in their present\r\nterritory. It is a fundamental article of the Shilluk creed that the\r\nspirit of the divine or semi-divine Nyakang is incarnate in the\r\nreigning king, who is accordingly himself invested to some extent\r\nwith the character of a divinity. But while the Shilluk hold their\r\nkings in high, indeed religious reverence and take every precaution\r\nagainst their accidental death, nevertheless they cherish "the\r\nconviction that the king must not be allowed to become ill or\r\nsenile, lest with his diminishing vigour the cattle should sicken\r\nand fail to bear their increase, the crops should rot in the fields,\r\nand man, stricken with disease, should die in ever-increasing\r\nnumbers." To prevent these calamities it used to be the regular\r\ncustom with the Shilluk to put the king to death whenever he showed\r\nsigns of ill-health or failing strength. One of the fatal symptoms\r\nof decay was taken to be an incapacity to satisfy the sexual\r\npassions of his wives, of whom he has very many, distributed in a\r\nlarge number of houses at Fashoda. When this ominous weakness\r\nmanifested itself, the wives reported it to the chiefs, who are\r\npopularly said to have intimated to the king his doom by spreading a\r\nwhite cloth over his face and knees as he lay slumbering in the heat\r\nof the sultry afternoon. Execution soon followed the sentence of\r\ndeath. A hut was specially built for the occasion: the king was led\r\ninto it and lay down with his head resting on the lap of a nubile\r\nvirgin: the door of the hut was then walled up; and the couple were\r\nleft without food, water, or fire to die of hunger and suffocation.\r\nThis was the old custom, but it was abolished some five generations\r\nago on account of the excessive sufferings of one of the kings who\r\nperished in this way. It is said that the chiefs announce his fate\r\nto the king, and that afterwards he is strangled in a hut which has\r\nbeen specially built for the occasion.\r\n\r\nFrom Dr. Seligman\'s enquiries it appears that not only was the\r\nShilluk king liable to be killed with due ceremony at the first\r\nsymptoms of incipient decay, but even while he was yet in the prime\r\nof health and strength he might be attacked at any time by a rival\r\nand have to defend his crown in a combat to the death. According to\r\nthe common Shilluk tradition any son of a king had the right thus to\r\nfight the king in possession and, if he succeeded in killing him, to\r\nreign in his stead. As every king had a large harem and many sons,\r\nthe number of possible candidates for the throne at any time may\r\nwell have been not inconsiderable, and the reigning monarch must\r\nhave carried his life in his hand. But the attack on him could only\r\ntake place with any prospect of success at night; for during the day\r\nthe king surrounded himself with his friends and bodyguards, and an\r\naspirant to the throne could hardly hope to cut his way through them\r\nand strike home. It was otherwise at night. For then the guards were\r\ndismissed and the king was alone in his enclosure with his favourite\r\nwives, and there was no man near to defend him except a few\r\nherdsmen, whose huts stood a little way off. The hours of darkness\r\nwere therefore the season of peril for the king. It is said that he\r\nused to pass them in constant watchfulness, prowling round his huts\r\nfully armed, peering into the blackest shadows, or himself standing\r\nsilent and alert, like a sentinel on duty, in some dark corner. When\r\nat last his rival appeared, the fight would take place in grim\r\nsilence, broken only by the clash of spears and shields, for it was\r\na point of honour with the king not to call the herdsmen to his\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nLike Nyakang himself, their founder, each of the Shilluk kings after\r\ndeath is worshipped at a shrine, which is erected over his grave,\r\nand the grave of a king is always in the village where he was born.\r\nThe tomb-shrine of a king resembles the shrine of Nyakang,\r\nconsisting of a few huts enclosed by a fence; one of the huts is\r\nbuilt over the king\'s grave, the others are occupied by the\r\nguardians of the shrine. Indeed the shrines of Nyakang and the\r\nshrines of the kings are scarcely to be distinguished from each\r\nother, and the religious rituals observed at all of them are\r\nidentical in form and vary only in matters of detail, the variations\r\nbeing due apparently to the far greater sanctity attributed to the\r\nshrines of Nyakang. The grave-shrines of the kings are tended by\r\ncertain old men or women, who correspond to the guardians of the\r\nshrines of Nyakang. They are usually widows or old men-servants of\r\nthe deceased king, and when they die they are succeeded in their\r\noffice by their descendants. Moreover, cattle are dedicated to the\r\ngrave-shrines of the kings and sacrifices are offered at them just\r\nas at the shrines of Nyakang.\r\n\r\nIn general the principal element in the religion of the Shilluk\r\nwould seem to be the worship which they pay to their sacred or\r\ndivine kings, whether dead or alive. These are believed to be\r\nanimated by a single divine spirit, which has been transmitted from\r\nthe semi-mythical, but probably in substance historical, founder of\r\nthe dynasty through all his successors to the present day. Hence,\r\nregarding their kings as incarnate divinities on whom the welfare of\r\nmen, of cattle, and of the corn implicitly depends, the Shilluk\r\nnaturally pay them the greatest respect and take every care of them;\r\nand however strange it may seem to us, their custom of putting the\r\ndivine king to death as soon as he shows signs of ill-health or\r\nfailing strength springs directly from their profound veneration for\r\nhim and from their anxiety to preserve him, or rather the divine\r\nspirit by which he is animated, in the most perfect state of\r\nefficiency: nay, we may go further and say that their practice of\r\nregicide is the best proof they can give of the high regard in which\r\nthey hold their kings. For they believe, as we have seen, that the\r\nking\'s life or spirit is so sympathetically bound up with the\r\nprosperity of the whole country, that if he fell ill or grew senile\r\nthe cattle would sicken and cease to multiply, the crops would rot\r\nin the fields, and men would perish of widespread disease. Hence, in\r\ntheir opinion, the only way of averting these calamities is to put\r\nthe king to death while he is still hale and hearty, in order that\r\nthe divine spirit which he has inherited from his predecessors may\r\nbe transmitted in turn by him to his successor while it is still in\r\nfull vigour and has not yet been impaired by the weakness of disease\r\nand old age. In this connexion the particular symptom which is\r\ncommonly said to seal the king\'s death-warrant is highly\r\nsignificant; when he can no longer satisfy the passions of his\r\nnumerous wives, in other words, when he has ceased, whether\r\npartially or wholly, to be able to reproduce his kind, it is time\r\nfor him to die and to make room for a more vigorous successor. Taken\r\nalong with the other reasons which are alleged for putting the king\r\nto death, this one suggests that the fertility of men, of cattle,\r\nand of the crops is believed to depend sympathetically on the\r\ngenerative power of the king, so that the complete failure of that\r\npower in him would involve a corresponding failure in men, animals,\r\nand plants, and would thereby entail at no distant date the entire\r\nextinction of all life, whether human, animal, or vegetable. No\r\nwonder, that with such a danger before their eyes the Shilluk should\r\nbe most careful not to let the king die what we should call a\r\nnatural death of sickness or old age. It is characteristic of their\r\nattitude towards the death of the kings that they refrain from\r\nspeaking of it as death: they do not say that a king has died but\r\nsimply that he has "gone away" like his divine ancestors Nyakang and\r\nDag, the two first kings of the dynasty, both of whom are reported\r\nnot to have died but to have disappeared. The similar legends of the\r\nmysterious disappearance of early kings in other lands, for example\r\nat Rome and in Uganda, may well point to a similar custom of putting\r\nthem to death for the purpose of preserving their life.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the theory and practice of the divine kings of the\r\nShilluk correspond very nearly to the theory and practice of the\r\npriests of Nemi, the Kings of the Wood, if my view of the latter is\r\ncorrect. In both we see a series of divine kings on whose life the\r\nfertility of men, of cattle, and of vegetation is believed to\r\ndepend, and who are put to death, whether in single combat or\r\notherwise, in order that their divine spirit may be transmitted to\r\ntheir successors in full vigour, uncontaminated by the weakness and\r\ndecay of sickness or old age, because any such degeneration on the\r\npart of the king would, in the opinion of his worshippers, entail a\r\ncorresponding degeneration on manking, on cattle, and on the crops.\r\nSome points in this explanation of the custom of putting divine\r\nkings to death, particularly the method of transmitting their divine\r\nsouls to their successors, will be dealt with more fully in the\r\nsequel. Meantime we pass to other examples of the general practice.\r\n\r\nThe Dinka are a congeries of independent tribes in the valley of the\r\nWhite Nile. They are essentially a pastoral people, passionately\r\ndevoted to the care of their numerous herds of oxen, though they\r\nalso keep sheep and goats, and the women cultivate small quantities\r\nof millet and sesame. For their crops and above all for their\r\npastures they depend on the regularity of the rains: in seasons of\r\nprolonged drought they are said to be reduced to great extremities.\r\nHence the rain-maker is a very important personage among them to\r\nthis day; indeed the men in authority whom travellers dub chiefs or\r\nsheikhs are in fact the actual or potential rain-makers of the tribe\r\nor community. Each of them is believed to be animated by the spirit\r\nof a great rain-maker, which has come down to him through a\r\nsuccession of rain-makers; and in virtue of this inspiration a\r\nsuccessful rain-maker enjoys very great power and is consulted on\r\nall important matters. Yet in spite, or rather in virtue, of the\r\nhigh honour in which he is held, no Dinka rain-maker is allowed to\r\ndie a natural death of sickness or old age; for the Dinka believe\r\nthat if such an untoward event were to happen, the tribe would\r\nsuffer from disease and famine, and the herds would not yield their\r\nincrease. So when a rain-maker feels that he is growing old and\r\ninfirm, he tells his children that he wishes to die. Among the Agar\r\nDinka a large grave is dug and the rain-maker lies down in it,\r\nsurrounded by his friends and relatives. From time to time he speaks\r\nto the people, recalling the past history of the tribe, reminding\r\nthem how he has ruled and advised them, and instructing them how\r\nthey are to act in the future. Then, when he has concluded his\r\nadmonition, he bids them cover him up. So the earth is thrown down\r\non him as he lies in the grave, and he soon dies of suffocation.\r\nSuch, with minor variations, appears to be the regular end of the\r\nhonourable career of a rain-maker in all the Dinka tribes. The\r\nKhor-Adar Dinka told Dr. Seligman that when they have dug the grave\r\nfor their rain-maker they strangle him in his house. The father and\r\npaternal uncle of one of Dr. Seligman\'s informants had both been\r\nrain-makers and both had been killed in the most regular and\r\northodox fashion. Even if a rain-maker is quite young he will be put\r\nto death should he seem likely to perish of disease. Further, every\r\nprecaution is taken to prevent a rain-maker from dying an accidental\r\ndeath, for such an end, though not nearly so serious a matter as\r\ndeath from illness or old age, would be sure to entail sickness on\r\nthe tribe. As soon as a rain-maker is killed, his valuable spirit is\r\nsupposed to pass to a suitable successor, whether a son or other\r\nnear blood relation.\r\n\r\nIn the Central African kingdom of Bunyoro down to recent years\r\ncustom required that as soon as the king fell seriously ill or began\r\nto break up from age, he should die by his own hand; for, according\r\nto an old prophecy, the throne would pass away from the dynasty if\r\never the king were to die a natural death. He killed himself by\r\ndraining a poisoned cup. If he faltered or were too ill to ask for\r\nthe cup, it was his wife\'s duty to administer the poison. When the\r\nking of Kibanga, on the Upper Congo, seems near his end, the\r\nsorcerers put a rope round his neck, which they draw gradually\r\ntighter till he dies. If the king of Gingiro happens to be wounded\r\nin war, he is put to death by his comrades, or, if they fail to kill\r\nhim, by his kinsfolk, however hard he may beg for mercy. They say\r\nthey do it that he may not die by the hands of his enemies. The\r\nJukos are a heathen tribe of the Benue River, a great tributary of\r\nthe Niger. In their country "the town of Gatri is ruled by a king\r\nwho is elected by the big men of the town as follows. When in the\r\nopinion of the big men the king has reigned long enough, they give\r\nout that \'the king is sick\'--a formula understood by all to mean\r\nthat they are going to kill him, though the intention is never put\r\nmore plainly. They then decide who is to be the next king. How long\r\nhe is to reign is settled by the influential men at a meeting; the\r\nquestion is put and answered by each man throwing on the ground a\r\nlittle piece of stick for each year he thinks the new king should\r\nrule. The king is then told, and a great feast prepared, at which\r\nthe king gets drunk on guinea-corn beer. After that he is speared,\r\nand the man who was chosen becomes king. Thus each Juko king knows\r\nthat he cannot have very many more years to live, and that he is\r\ncertain of his predecessor\'s fate. This, however, does not seem to\r\nfrighten candidates. The same custom of king-killing is said to\r\nprevail at Quonde and Wukari as well as at Gatri." In the three\r\nHausa kingdoms of Gobir, Katsina, and Daura, in Northern Nigeria, as\r\nsoon as a king showed signs of failing health or growing infirmity,\r\nan official who bore the title of Killer of the Elephant appeared\r\nand throttled him.\r\n\r\nThe Matiamvo is a great king or emperor in the interior of Angola.\r\nOne of the inferior kings of the country, by name Challa, gave to a\r\nPortuguese expedition the following account of the manner in which\r\nthe Matiamvo comes by his end. "It has been customary," he said,\r\n"for our Matiamvos to die either in war or by a violent death, and\r\nthe present Matiamvo must meet this last fate, as, in consequence of\r\nhis great exactions, he has lived long enough. When we come to this\r\nunderstanding, and decide that he should be killed, we invite him to\r\nmake war with our enemies, on which occasion we all accompany him\r\nand his family to the war, when we lose some of our people. If he\r\nescapes unhurt, we return to the war again and fight for three or\r\nfour days. We then suddenly abandon him and his family to their\r\nfate, leaving him in the enemy\'s hands. Seeing himself thus\r\ndeserted, he causes his throne to be erected, and, sitting down,\r\ncalls his family around him. He then orders his mother to approach;\r\nshe kneels at his feet; he first cuts off her head, then decapitates\r\nhis sons in succession, next his wives and relatives, and, last of\r\nall, his most beloved wife, called Anacullo. This slaughter being\r\naccomplished, the Matiamvo, dressed in all his pomp, awaits his own\r\ndeath, which immediately follows, by an officer sent by the powerful\r\nneighbouring chiefs, Caniquinha and Canica. This officer first cuts\r\noff his legs and arms at the joints, and lastly he cuts off his\r\nhead; after which the head of the officer is struck off. All the\r\npotentates retire from the encampment, in order not to witness his\r\ndeath. It is my duty to remain and witness his death, and to mark\r\nthe place where the head and arms have been deposited by the two\r\ngreat chiefs, the enemies of the Matiamvo. They also take possession\r\nof all the property belonging to the deceased monarch and his\r\nfamily, which they convey to their own residence. I then provide for\r\nthe funeral of the mutilated remains of the late Matiamvo, after\r\nwhich I retire to his capital and proclaim the new government. I\r\nthen return to where the head, legs, and arms have been deposited,\r\nand, for forty slaves, I ransom them, together with the merchandise\r\nand other property belonging to the deceased, which I give up to the\r\nnew Matiamvo, who has been proclaimed. This is what has happened to\r\nmany Matiamvos, and what must happen to the present one."\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been a Zulu custom to put the king to death as\r\nsoon as he began to have wrinkles or grey hairs. At least this seems\r\nimplied in the following passage written by one who resided for some\r\ntime at the court of the notorious Zulu tyrant Chaka, in the early\r\npart of the nineteenth century: "The extraordinary violence of the\r\nking\'s rage with me was mainly occasioned by that absurd nostrum,\r\nthe hair oil, with the notion of which Mr. Farewell had impressed\r\nhim as being a specific for removing all indications of age. From\r\nthe first moment of his having heard that such a preparation was\r\nattainable, he evinced a solicitude to procure it, and on every\r\noccasion never forgot to remind us of his anxiety respecting it;\r\nmore especially on our departure on the mission his injunctions were\r\nparticularly directed to this object. It will be seen that it is one\r\nof the barbarous customs of the Zoolas in their choice or election\r\nof their kings that he must neither have wrinkles nor grey hairs, as\r\nthey are both distinguishing marks of disqualification for becoming\r\na monarch of a warlike people. It is also equally indispensable that\r\ntheir king should never exhibit those proofs of having become unfit\r\nand incompetent to reign; it is therefore important that they should\r\nconceal these indications so long as they possibly can. Chaka had\r\nbecome greatly apprehensive of the approach of grey hairs; which\r\nwould at once be the signal for him to prepare to make his exit from\r\nthis sublunary world, it being always followed by the death of the\r\nmonarch." The writer to whom we are indebted for this instructive\r\nanecdote of the hair oil omits to specify the mode in which a\r\ngrey-haired and wrinkled Zulu chief used "to make his exit from this\r\nsublunary world"; but on analogy we may conjecture that he was\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nThe custom of putting kings to death as soon as they suffered from\r\nany personal defect prevailed two centuries ago in the Caffre\r\nkingdom of Sofala. We have seen that these kings of Sofala were\r\nregarded as gods by their people, being entreated to give rain or\r\nsunshine, according as each might be wanted. Nevertheless a slight\r\nbodily blemish, such as the loss of a tooth, was considered a\r\nsufficient cause for putting one of these god-men to death, as we\r\nlearn from the following passage of an old Portuguese historian: "It\r\nwas formerly the custom of the kings of this land to commit suicide\r\nby taking poison when any disaster or natural physical defect fell\r\nupon them, such as impotence, infectious disease, the loss of their\r\nfront teeth, by which they were disfigured, or any other deformity\r\nor affliction. To put an end to such defects they killed themselves,\r\nsaying that the king should be free from any blemish, and if not, it\r\nwas better for his honour that he should die and seek another life\r\nwhere he would be made whole, for there everything was perfect. But\r\nthe Quiteve (king) who reigned when I was in those parts would not\r\nimitate his predecessors in this, being discreet and dreaded as he\r\nwas; for having lost a front tooth he caused it to be proclaimed\r\nthroughout the kingdom that all should be aware that he had lost a\r\ntooth and should recognise him when they saw him without it, and if\r\nhis predecessors killed themselves for such things they were very\r\nfoolish, and he would not do so; on the contrary, he would be very\r\nsorry when the time came for him to die a natural death, for his\r\nlife was very necessary to preserve his kingdom and defend it from\r\nhis enemies; and he recommended his successors to follow his\r\nexample."\r\n\r\nThe king of Sofala who dared to survive the loss of his front tooth\r\nwas thus a bold reformer like Ergamenes, king of Ethiopia. We may\r\nconjecture that the ground for putting the Ethiopian kings to death\r\nwas, as in the case of the Zulu and Sofala kings, the appearance on\r\ntheir person of any bodily defect or sign of decay; and that the\r\noracle which the priests alleged as the authority for the royal\r\nexecution was to the effect that great calamities would result from\r\nthe reign of a king who had any blemish on his body; just as an\r\noracle warned Sparta against a "lame reign," that is, the reign of a\r\nlame king. It is some confirmation of this conjecture that the kings\r\nof Ethiopia were chosen for their size, strength, and beauty long\r\nbefore the custom of killing them was abolished. To this day the\r\nSultan of Wadai must have no obvious bodily defect, and the king of\r\nAngoy cannot be crowned if he has a single blemish, such as a broken\r\nor a filed tooth or the scar of an old wound. According to the Book\r\nof Acaill and many other authorities no king who was afflicted with\r\na personal blemish might reign over Ireland at Tara. Hence, when the\r\ngreat King Cormac Mac Art lost one eye by an accident, he at once\r\nabdicated.\r\n\r\nMany days\' journey to the north-east of Abomey, the old capital of\r\nDahomey, lies the kingdom of Eyeo. "The Eyeos are governed by a\r\nking, no less absolute than the king of Dahomey, yet subject to a\r\nregulation of state, at once humiliating and extraordinary. When the\r\npeople have conceived an opinion of his ill-government, which is\r\nsometimes insidiously infused into them by the artifice of his\r\ndiscontented ministers, they send a deputation to him with a present\r\nof parrots\' eggs, as a mark of its authenticity, to represent to him\r\nthat the burden of government must have so far fatigued him that\r\nthey consider it full time for him to repose from his cares and\r\nindulge himself with a little sleep. He thanks his subjects for\r\ntheir attention to his ease, retires to his own apartment as if to\r\nsleep, and there gives directions to his women to strangle him. This\r\nis immediately executed, and his son quietly ascends the throne upon\r\nthe usual terms of holding the reins of government no longer than\r\nwhilst he merits the approbation of the people." About the year\r\n1774, a king of Eyeo, whom his ministers attempted to remove in the\r\ncustomary manner, positively refused to accept the proffered\r\nparrots\' eggs at their hands, telling them that he had no mind to\r\ntake a nap, but on the contrary was resolved to watch for the\r\nbenefit of his subjects. The ministers, surprised and indignant at\r\nhis recalcitrancy, raised a rebellion, but were defeated with great\r\nslaughter, and thus by his spirited conduct the king freed himself\r\nfrom the tyranny of his councillors and established a new precedent\r\nfor the guidance of his successors. However, the old custom seems to\r\nhave revived and persisted until late in the nineteenth century, for\r\na Catholic missionary, writing in 1884, speaks of the practice as if\r\nit were still in vogue. Another missionary, writing in 1881, thus\r\ndescribes the usage of the Egbas and the Yorubas of West Africa:\r\n"Among the customs of the country one of the most curious is\r\nunquestionably that of judging, and punishing the king. Should he\r\nhave earned the hatred of his people by exceeding his rights, one of\r\nhis councillors, on whom the heavy duty is laid, requires of the\r\nprince that he shall \'go to sleep,\' which means simply \'take poison\r\nand die.\' If his courage fails him at the supreme moment, a friend\r\nrenders him this last service, and quietly, without betraying the\r\nsecret, they prepare the people for the news of the king\'s death. In\r\nYoruba the thing is managed a little differently. When a son is born\r\nto the king of Oyo, they make a model of the infant\'s right foot in\r\nclay and keep it in the house of the elders (_ogboni_). If the king\r\nfails to observe the customs of the country, a messenger, without\r\nspeaking a word, shows him his child\'s foot. The king knows what\r\nthat means. He takes poison and goes to sleep." The old Prussians\r\nacknowledged as their supreme lord a ruler who governed them in the\r\nname of the gods, and was known as "God\'s Mouth." When he felt\r\nhimself weak and ill, if he wished to leave a good name behind him,\r\nhe had a great heap made of thorn-bushes and straw, on which he\r\nmounted and delivered a long sermon to the people, exhorting them to\r\nserve the gods and promising to go to the gods and speak for the\r\npeople. Then he took some of the perpetual fire which burned in\r\nfront of the holy oak-tree, and lighting the pile with it burned\r\nhimself to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Kings killed at the End of a Fixed Term\r\n\r\nIN THE CASES hitherto described, the divine king or priest is\r\nsuffered by his people to retain office until some outward defect,\r\nsome visible symptom of failing health or advancing age, warns them\r\nthat he is no longer equal to the discharge of his divine duties;\r\nbut not until such symptoms have made their appearance is he put to\r\ndeath. Some peoples, however, appear to have thought it unsafe to\r\nwait for even the slightest symptom of decay and have preferred to\r\nkill the king while he was still in the full vigour of life.\r\nAccordingly, they have fixed a term beyond which he might not reign,\r\nand at the close of which he must die, the term fixed upon being\r\nshort enough to exclude the probability of his degenerating\r\nphysically in the interval. In some parts of Southern India the\r\nperiod fixed was twelve years. Thus, according to an old traveller,\r\nin the province of Quilacare, "there is a Gentile house of prayer,\r\nin which there is an idol which they hold in great account, and\r\nevery twelve years they celebrate a great feast to it, whither all\r\nthe Gentiles go as to a jubilee. This temple possesses many lands\r\nand much revenue: it is a very great affair. This province has a\r\nking over it, who has not more than twelve years to reign from\r\njubilee to jubilee. His manner of living is in this wise, that is to\r\nsay: when the twelve years are completed, on the day of this feast\r\nthere assemble together innumerable people, and much money is spent\r\nin giving food to Bramans. The king has a wooden scaffolding made,\r\nspread over with silken hangings: and on that day he goes to bathe\r\nat a tank with great ceremonies and sound of music, after that he\r\ncomes to the idol and prays to it, and mounts on to the scaffolding,\r\nand there before all the people he takes some very sharp knives, and\r\nbegins to cut off his nose, and then his ears, and his lips, and all\r\nhis members, and as much flesh off himself as he can; and he throws\r\nit away very hurriedly until so much of his blood is spilled that he\r\nbegins to faint, and then he cuts his throat himself. And he\r\nperforms this sacrifice to the idol, and whoever desires to reign\r\nanother twelve years and undertake this martyrdom for love of the\r\nidol, has to be present looking on at this: and from that place they\r\nraise him up as king."\r\n\r\nThe king of Calicut, on the Malabar coast, bears the title of\r\nSamorin or Samory. He "pretends to be of a higher rank than the\r\nBrahmans, and to be inferior only to the invisible gods; a\r\npretention that was acknowledged by his subjects, but which is held\r\nas absurd and abominable by the Brahmans, by whom he is only treated\r\nas a Sudra." Formerly the Samorin had to cut his throat in public at\r\nthe end of a twelve years\' reign. But towards the end of the\r\nseventeenth century the rule had been modified as follows: "Many\r\nstrange customs were observed in this country in former times, and\r\nsome very odd ones are still continued. It was an ancient custom for\r\nthe Samorin to reign but twelve years, and no longer. If he died\r\nbefore his term was expired, it saved him a troublesome ceremony of\r\ncutting his own throat, on a publick scaffold erected for the\r\npurpose. He first made a feast for all his nobility and gentry, who\r\nare very numerous. After the feast he saluted his guests, and went\r\non the scaffold, and very decently cut his own throat in the view of\r\nthe assembly, and his body was, a little while after, burned with\r\ngreat pomp and ceremony, and the grandees elected a new Samorin.\r\nWhether that custom was a religious or a civil ceremony, I know not,\r\nbut it is now laid aside. And a new custom is followed by the modern\r\nSamorins, that jubilee is proclaimed throughout his dominions, at\r\nthe end of twelve years, and a tent is pitched for him in a spacious\r\nplain, and a great feast is celebrated for ten or twelve days, with\r\nmirth and jollity, guns firing night and day, so at the end of the\r\nfeast any four of the guests that have a mind to gain a crown by a\r\ndesperate action, in fighting their way through 30 or 40,000 of his\r\nguards, and kill the Samorin in his tent, he that kills him succeeds\r\nhim in his empire. In anno 1695, one of those jubilees happened, and\r\nthe tent pitched near Pennany, a seaport of his, about fifteen\r\nleagues to the southward of Calicut. There were but three men that\r\nwould venture on that desperate action, who fell in, with sword and\r\ntarget, among the guard, and, after they had killed and wounded\r\nmany, were themselves killed. One of the desperados had a nephew of\r\nfifteen or sixteen years of age, that kept close by his uncle in the\r\nattack on the guards, and, when he saw him fall, the youth got\r\nthrough the guards into the tent, and made a stroke at his Majesty\'s\r\nhead, and had certainly despatched him if a large brass lamp which\r\nwas burning over his head had not marred the blow; but, before he\r\ncould make another, he was killed by the guards; and, I believe, the\r\nsame Samorin reigns yet. I chanced to come that time along the coast\r\nand heard the guns for two or three days and nights successively."\r\n\r\nThe English traveller, whose account I have quoted, did not himself\r\nwitness the festival he describes, though he heard the sound of the\r\nfiring in the distance. Fortunately, exact records of these\r\nfestivals and of the number of men who perished at them have been\r\npreserved in the archives of the royal family at Calicut. In the\r\nlatter part of the nineteenth century they were examined by Mr. W.\r\nLogan, with the personal assistance of the reigning king, and from\r\nhis work it is possible to gain an accurate conception both of the\r\ntragedy and of the scene where it was periodically enacted down to\r\n1743, when the ceremony took place for the last time.\r\n\r\nThe festival at which the king of Calicut staked his crown and his\r\nlife on the issue of battle was known as the "Great Sacrifice." It\r\nfell every twelfth year, when the planet Jupiter was in retrograde\r\nmotion in the sign of the Crab, and it lasted twenty-eight days,\r\nculminating at the time of the eighth lunar asterism in the month of\r\nMakaram. As the date of the festival was determined by the position\r\nof Jupiter in the sky, and the interval between two festivals was\r\ntwelve years, which is roughly Jupiter\'s period of revolution round\r\nthe sun, we may conjecture that the splendid planet was supposed to\r\nbe in a special sense the king\'s star and to rule his destiny, the\r\nperiod of its revolution in heaven corresponding to the period of\r\nhis reign on earth. However that may be, the ceremony was observed\r\nwith great pomp at the Tirunavayi temple, on the north bank of the\r\nPonnani River. The spot is close to the present railway line. As the\r\ntrain rushes by, you can just catch a glimpse of the temple, almost\r\nhidden behind a clump of trees on the river bank. From the western\r\ngateway of the temple a perfectly straight road, hardly raised above\r\nthe level of the surrounding rice-fields and shaded by a fine\r\navenue, runs for half a mile to a high ridge with a precipitous\r\nbank, on which the outlines of three or four terraces can still be\r\ntraced. On the topmost of these terraces the king took his stand on\r\nthe eventful day. The view which it commands is a fine one. Across\r\nthe flat expanse of the rice-fields, with the broad placid river\r\nwinding through them, the eye ranges eastward to high tablelands,\r\ntheir lower slopes embowered in woods, while afar off looms the\r\ngreat chain of the western Ghauts, and in the furthest distance the\r\nNeilgherries or Blue Mountains, hardly distinguishable from the\r\nazure of the sky above.\r\n\r\nBut it was not to the distant prospect that the king\'s eyes\r\nnaturally turned at this crisis of his fate. His attention was\r\narrested by a spectacle nearer at hand. For all the plain below was\r\nalive with troops, their banners waving gaily in the sun, the white\r\ntents of their many camps standing sharply out against the green and\r\ngold of the ricefields. Forty thousand fighting men or more were\r\ngathered there to defend the king. But if the plain swarmed with\r\nsoldiers, the road that cuts across it from the temple to the king\'s\r\nstand was clear of them. Not a soul was stirring on it. Each side of\r\nthe way was barred by palisades, and from the palisades on either\r\nhand a long hedge of spears, held by strong arms, projected into the\r\nempty road, their blades meeting in the middle and forming a\r\nglittering arch of steel. All was now ready. The king waved his\r\nsword. At the same moment a great chain of massy gold, enriched with\r\nbosses, was placed on an elephant at his side. That was the signal.\r\nOn the instant a stir might be seen half a mile away at the gate of\r\nthe temple. A group of swordsmen, decked with flowers and smeared\r\nwith ashes, has stepped out from the crowd. They have just partaken\r\nof their last meal on earth, and they now receive the last blessings\r\nand farewells of their friends. A moment more and they are coming\r\ndown the lane of spears, hewing and stabbing right and left at the\r\nspearmen, winding and turning and writhing among the blades as if\r\nthey had no bones in their bodies. It is all in vain. One after the\r\nother they fall, some nearer the king, some farther off, content to\r\ndie, not for the shadow of a crown, but for the mere sake of\r\napproving their dauntless valour and swordsmanship to the world. On\r\nthe last days of the festival the same magnificent display of\r\ngallantry, the same useless sacrifice of life was repeated again and\r\nagain. Yet perhaps no sacrifice is wholly useless which proves that\r\nthere are men who prefer honour to life.\r\n\r\n"It is a singular custom in Bengal," says an old native historian of\r\nIndia, "that there is little of hereditary descent in succession to\r\nthe sovereignty. . . . Whoever kills the king, and succeeds in\r\nplacing himself on that throne, is immediately acknowledged as king;\r\nall the _amirs, wazirs,_ soldiers, and peasants instantly obey and\r\nsubmit to him, and consider him as being as much their sovereign as\r\nthey did their former prince, and obey his orders implicitly. The\r\npeople of Bengal say, \'We are faithful to the throne; whoever fills\r\nthe throne we are obedient and true to it.\'" A custom of the same\r\nsort formerly prevailed in the little kingdom of Passier, on the\r\nnorthern coast of Sumatra. The old Portuguese historian De Barros,\r\nwho informs us of it, remarks with surprise that no wise man would\r\nwish to be king of Passier, since the monarch was not allowed by his\r\nsubjects to live long. From time to time a sort of fury seized the\r\npeople, and they marched through the streets of the city chanting\r\nwith loud voices the fatal words, "The king must die!" When the king\r\nheard that song of death he knew that his hour had come. The man who\r\nstruck the fatal blow was of the royal lineage, and as soon as he\r\nhad done the deed of blood and seated himself on the throne he was\r\nregarded as the legitimate king, provided that he contrived to\r\nmaintain his seat peaceably for a single day. This, however, the\r\nregicide did not always succeed in doing. When Fern\xe3o Peres\r\nd\'Andrade, on a voyage to China, put in at Passier for a cargo of\r\nspices, two kings were massacred, and that in the most peaceable and\r\norderly manner, without the smallest sign of tumult or sedition in\r\nthe city, where everything went on in its usual course, as if the\r\nmurder or execution of a king were a matter of everyday occurrence.\r\nIndeed, on one occasion three kings were raised to the dangerous\r\nelevation and followed each other in the dusty road of death in a\r\nsingle day. The people defended the custom, which they esteemed very\r\nlaudable and even of divine institution, by saying that God would\r\nnever allow so high and mighty a being as a king, who reigned as his\r\nvicegerent on earth, to perish by violence unless for his sins he\r\nthoroughly deserved it. Far away from the tropical island of Sumatra\r\na rule of the same sort appears to have obtained among the old\r\nSlavs. When the captives Gunn and Jarmerik contrived to slay the\r\nking and queen of the Slavs and made their escape, they were pursued\r\nby the barbarians, who shouted after them that if they would only\r\ncome back they would reign instead of the murdered monarch, since by\r\na public statute of the ancients the succession to the throne fell\r\nto the king\'s assassin. But the flying regicides turned a deaf ear\r\nto promises which they regarded as mere baits to lure them back to\r\ndestruction; they continued their flight, and the shouts and clamour\r\nof the barbarians gradually died away in the distance.\r\n\r\nWhen kings were bound to suffer death, whether at their own hands or\r\nat the hands of others, on the expiration of a fixed term of years,\r\nit was natural that they should seek to delegate the painful duty,\r\nalong with some of the privileges of sovereignty, to a substitute\r\nwho should suffer vicariously in their stead. This expedient appears\r\nto have been resorted to by some of the princes of Malabar. Thus we\r\nare informed by a native authority on that country that "in some\r\nplaces all powers both executive and judicial were delegated for a\r\nfixed period to natives by the sovereign. This institution was\r\nstyled _Thalavettiparothiam_ or authority obtained by decapitation.\r\n. . . It was an office tenable for five years during which its bearer\r\nwas invested with supreme despotic powers within his jurisdiction.\r\nOn the expiry of the five years the man\'s head was cut off and\r\nthrown up in the air amongst a large concourse of villagers, each of\r\nwhom vied with the other in trying to catch it in its course down.\r\nHe who succeeded was nominated to the post for the next five years."\r\n\r\nWhen once kings, who had hitherto been bound to die a violent death\r\nat the end of a term of years, conceived the happy thought of dying\r\nby deputy in the persons of others, they would very naturally put it\r\nin practice; and accordingly we need not wonder at finding so\r\npopular an expedient, or traces of it, in many lands. Scandinavian\r\ntraditions contain some hints that of old the Swedish kings reigned\r\nonly for periods of nine years, after which they were put to death\r\nor had to find a substitute to die in their stead. Thus Aun or On,\r\nking of Sweden, is said to have sacrificed to Odin for length of\r\ndays and to have been answered by the god that he should live so\r\nlong as he sacrificed one of his sons every ninth year. He\r\nsacrificed nine of them in this manner, and would have sacrificed\r\nthe tenth and last, but the Swedes would not allow him. So he died\r\nand was buried in a mound at Upsala. Another indication of a similar\r\ntenure of the crown occurs in a curious legend of the deposition and\r\nbanishment of Odin. Offended at his misdeeds, the other gods\r\noutlawed and exiled him, but set up in his place a substitute, Oller\r\nby name, a cunning wizard, to whom they accorded the symbols both of\r\nroyalty and of godhead. The deputy bore the name of Odin, and\r\nreigned for nearly ten years, when he was driven from the throne,\r\nwhile the real Odin came to his own again. His discomfited rival\r\nretired to Sweden and was afterwards slain in an attempt to repair\r\nhis shattered fortunes. As gods are often merely men who loom large\r\nthrough the mists of tradition, we may conjecture that this Norse\r\nlegend preserves a confused reminiscence of ancient Swedish kings\r\nwho reigned for nine or ten years together, then abdicated,\r\ndelegating to others the privilege of dying for their country. The\r\ngreat festival which was held at Upsala every nine years may have\r\nbeen the occasion on which the king or his deputy was put to death.\r\nWe know that human sacrifices formed part of the rites.\r\n\r\nThere are some grounds for believing that the reign of many ancient\r\nGreek kings was limited to eight years, or at least that at the end\r\nof every period of eight years a new consecration, a fresh\r\noutpouring of the divine grace, was regarded as necessary in order\r\nto enable them to discharge their civil and religious duties. Thus\r\nit was a rule of the Spartan constitution that every eighth year the\r\nephors should choose a clear and moonless night and sitting down\r\nobserve the sky in silence. If during their vigil they saw a meteor\r\nor shooting star, they inferred that the king had sinned against the\r\ndeity, and they suspended him from his functions until the Delphic\r\nor Olympic oracle should reinstate him in them. This custom, which\r\nhas all the air of great antiquity, was not suffered to remain a\r\ndead letter even in the last period of the Spartan monarchy; for in\r\nthe third century before our era a king, who had rendered himself\r\nobnoxious to the reforming party, was actually deposed on various\r\ntrumped-up charges, among which the allegation that the ominous sign\r\nhad been seen in the sky took a prominent place.\r\n\r\nIf the tenure of the regal office was formerly limited among the\r\nSpartans to eight years, we may naturally ask, why was that precise\r\nperiod selected as the measure of a king\'s reign? The reason is\r\nprobably to be found in those astronomical considerations which\r\ndetermined the early Greek calendar. The difficulty of reconciling\r\nlunar with solar time is one of the standing puzzles which has taxed\r\nthe ingenuity of men who are emerging from barbarism. Now an\r\noctennial cycle is the shortest period at the end of which sun and\r\nmoon really mark time together after overlapping, so to say,\r\nthroughout the whole of the interval. Thus, for example, it is only\r\nonce in every eight years that the full moon coincides with the\r\nlongest or shortest day; and as this coincidence can be observed\r\nwith the aid of a simple dial, the observation is naturally one of\r\nthe first to furnish a base for a calendar which shall bring lunar\r\nand solar times into tolerable, though not exact, harmony. But in\r\nearly days the proper adjustment of the calendar is a matter of\r\nreligious concern, since on it depends a knowledge of the right\r\nseasons for propitiating the deities whose favour is indispensable\r\nto the welfare of the community. No wonder, therefore, that the\r\nking, as the chief priest of the state, or as himself a god, should\r\nbe liable to deposition or death at the end of an astronomical\r\nperiod. When the great luminaries had run their course on high, and\r\nwere about to renew the heavenly race, it might well be thought that\r\nthe king should renew his divine energies, or prove them unabated,\r\nunder pain of making room for a more vigorous successor. In Southern\r\nIndia, as we have seen, the king\'s reign and life terminated with\r\nthe revolution of the planet Jupiter round the sun. In Greece, on\r\nthe other hand, the king\'s fate seems to have hung in the balance at\r\nthe end of every eight years, ready to fly up and kick the beam as\r\nsoon as the opposite scale was loaded with a falling star.\r\n\r\nWhatever its origin may have been, the cycle of eight years appears\r\nto have coincided with the normal length of the king\'s reign in\r\nother parts of Greece besides Sparta. Thus Minos, king of Cnossus in\r\nCrete, whose great palace has been unearthed in recent years, is\r\nsaid to have held office for periods of eight years together. At the\r\nend of each period he retired for a season to the oracular cave on\r\nMount Ida, and there communed with his divine father Zeus, giving\r\nhim an account of his kingship in the years that were past, and\r\nreceiving from him instructions for his guidance in those which were\r\nto come. The tradition plainly implies that at the end of every\r\neight years the king\'s sacred powers needed to be renewed by\r\nintercourse with the godhead, and that without such a renewal he\r\nwould have forfeited his right to the throne.\r\n\r\nWithout being unduly rash we may surmise that the tribute of seven\r\nyouths and seven maidens whom the Athenians were bound to send to\r\nMinos every eight years had some connexion with the renewal of the\r\nking\'s power for another octennial cycle. Traditions varied as to\r\nthe fate which awaited the lads and damsels on their arrival in\r\nCrete; but the common view appears to have been that they were shut\r\nup in the labyrinth, there to be devoured by the Minotaur, or at\r\nleast to be imprisoned for life. Perhaps they were sacrificed by\r\nbeing roasted alive in a bronze image of a bull, or of a bull-headed\r\nman, in order to renew the strength of the king and of the sun, whom\r\nhe personated. This at all events is suggested by the legend of\r\nTalos, a bronze man who clutched people to his breast and leaped\r\nwith them into the fire, so that they were roasted alive. He is said\r\nto have been given by Zeus to Europa, or by Hephaestus to Minos, to\r\nguard the island of Crete, which he patrolled thrice daily.\r\nAccording to one account he was a bull, according to another he was\r\nthe sun. Probably he was identical with the Minotaur, and stripped\r\nof his mythical features was nothing but a bronze image of the sun\r\nrepresented as a man with a bull\'s head. In order to renew the solar\r\nfires, human victims may have been sacrificed to the idol by being\r\nroasted in its hollow body or placed on its sloping hands and\r\nallowed to roll into a pit of fire. It was in the latter fashion\r\nthat the Carthaginians sacrificed their offspring to Moloch. The\r\nchildren were laid on the hands of a calf-headed image of bronze,\r\nfrom which they slid into a fiery oven, while the people danced to\r\nthe music of flutes and timbrels to drown the shrieks of the burning\r\nvictims. The resemblance which the Cretan traditions bear to the\r\nCarthaginian practice suggests that the worship associated with the\r\nnames of Minos and the Minotaur may have been powerfully influenced\r\nby that of a Semitic Baal. In the tradition of Phalaris, tyrant of\r\nAgrigentum, and his brazen bull we may have an echo of similar rites\r\nin Sicily, where the Carthaginian power struck deep roots.\r\n\r\nIn the province of Lagos, the Ijebu tribe of the Yoruba race is\r\ndivided into two branches, which are known respectively as the Ijebu\r\nOde and the Ijebu Remon. The Ode branch of the tribe is ruled by a\r\nchief who bears the title of Awujale and is surrounded by a great\r\ndeal of mystery. Down to recent times his face might not be seen\r\neven by his own subjects, and if circumstances obliged him to\r\ncommunicate with them he did so through a screen which hid him from\r\nview. The other or Remon branch of the Ijebu tribe is governed by a\r\nchief, who ranks below the Awujale. Mr. John Parkinson was informed\r\nthat in former times this subordinate chief used to be killed with\r\nceremony after a rule of three years. As the country is now under\r\nBritish protection the custom of putting the chief to death at the\r\nend of a three years\' reign has long been abolished, and Mr.\r\nParkinson was unable to ascertain any particulars on the subject.\r\n\r\nAt Babylon, within historical times, the tenure of the kingly office\r\nwas in practice lifelong, yet in theory it would seem to have been\r\nmerely annual. For every year at the festival of Zagmuk the king had\r\nto renew his power by seizing the hands of the image of Marduk in\r\nhis great temple of Esagil at Babylon. Even when Babylon passed\r\nunder the power of Assyria, the monarchs of that country were\r\nexpected to legalise their claim to the throne every year by coming\r\nto Babylon and performing the ancient ceremony at the New Year\r\nfestival, and some of them found the obligation so burdensome that\r\nrather than discharge it they renounced the title of king altogether\r\nand contented themselves with the humbler one of Governor. Further,\r\nit would appear that in remote times, though not within the\r\nhistorical period, the kings of Babylon or their barbarous\r\npredecessors forfeited not merely their crown but their life at the\r\nend of a year\'s tenure of office. At least this is the conclusion to\r\nwhich the following evidence seems to point. According to the\r\nhistorian Berosus, who as a Babylonian priest spoke with ample\r\nknowledge, there was annually celebrated in Babylon a festival\r\ncalled the Sacaea. It began on the sixteenth day of the month Lous,\r\nand lasted for five days, during which masters and servants changed\r\nplaces, the servants giving orders and the masters obeying them. A\r\nprisoner condemned to death was dressed in the king\'s robes, seated\r\non the king\'s throne, allowed to issue whatever commands he pleased,\r\nto eat, drink, and enjoy himself, and to lie with the king\'s\r\nconcubines. But at the end of the five days he was stripped of his\r\nroyal robes, scourged, and hanged or impaled. During his brief term\r\nof office he bore the title of Zoganes. This custom might perhaps\r\nhave been explained as merely a grim jest perpetrated in a season of\r\njollity at the expense of an unhappy criminal. But one\r\ncircumstance--the leave given to the mock king to enjoy the king\'s\r\nconcubines--is decisive against this interpretation. Considering the\r\njealous seclusion of an oriental despot\'s harem we may be quite\r\ncertain that permission to invade it would never have been granted\r\nby the despot, least of all to a condemned criminal, except for the\r\nvery gravest cause. This cause could hardly be other than that the\r\ncondemned man was about to die in the king\'s stead, and that to make\r\nthe substitution perfect it was necessary he should enjoy the full\r\nrights of royalty during his brief reign. There is nothing\r\nsurprising in this substitution. The rule that the king must be put\r\nto death either on the appearance of any symptom of bodily decay or\r\nat the end of a fixed period is certainly one which, sooner or\r\nlater, the kings would seek to abolish or modify. We have seen that\r\nin Ethiopia, Sofala, and Eyeo the rule was boldly set aside by\r\nenlightened monarchs; and that in Calicut the old custom of killing\r\nthe king at the end of twelve years was changed into a permission\r\ngranted to any one at the end of the twelve years\' period to attack\r\nthe king, and, in the event of killing him, to reign in his stead;\r\nthough, as the king took care at these times to be surrounded by his\r\nguards, the permission was little more than a form. Another way of\r\nmodifying the stern old rule is seen in the Babylonian custom just\r\ndescribed. When the time drew near for the king to be put to death\r\n(in Babylon this appears to have been at the end of a single year\'s\r\nreign) he abdicated for a few days, during which a temporary king\r\nreigned and suffered in his stead. At first the temporary king may\r\nhave been an innocent person, possibly a member of the king\'s own\r\nfamily; but with the growth of civilisation the sacrifice of an\r\ninnocent person would be revolting to the public sentiment, and\r\naccordingly a condemned criminal would be invested with the brief\r\nand fatal sovereignty. In the sequel we shall find other examples of\r\na dying criminal representing a dying god. For we must not forget\r\nthat, as the case of the Shilluk kings clearly shows, the king is\r\nslain in his character of a god or a demigod, his death and\r\nresurrection, as the only means of perpetuating the divine life\r\nunimpaired, being deemed necessary for the salvation of his people\r\nand the world.\r\n\r\nA vestige of a practice of putting the king to death at the end of a\r\nyear\'s reign appears to have survived in the festival called\r\nMacahity, which used to be celebrated in Hawaii during the last\r\nmonth of the year. About a hundred years ago a Russian voyager\r\ndescribed the custom as follows: "The taboo Macahity is not unlike\r\nto our festival of Christmas. It continues a whole month, during\r\nwhich the people amuse themselves with dances, plays, and\r\nsham-fights of every kind. The king must open this festival wherever\r\nhe is. On this occasion his majesty dresses himself in his richest\r\ncloak and helmet, and is paddled in a canoe along the shore,\r\nfollowed sometimes by many of his subjects. He embarks early, and\r\nmust finish his excursion at sunrise. The strongest and most expert\r\nof the warriors is chosen to receive him on his landing. This\r\nwarrior watches the canoe along the beach; and as soon as the king\r\nlands, and has thrown off his cloak, he darts his spear at him, from\r\na distance of about thirty paces, and the king must either catch the\r\nspear in his hand, or suffer from it: there is no jesting in the\r\nbusiness. Having caught it, he carries it under his arm, with the\r\nsharp end downwards, into the temple or _heavoo._ On his entrance,\r\nthe assembled multitude begin their sham-fights, and immediately the\r\nair is obscured by clouds of spears, made for the occasion with\r\nblunted ends. Hamamea [the king] has been frequently advised to\r\nabolish this ridiculous ceremony, in which he risks his life every\r\nyear; but to no effect. His answer always is, that he is as able to\r\ncatch a spear as any one on the island is to throw it at him. During\r\nthe Macahity, all punishments are remitted throughout the country;\r\nand no person can leave the place in which he commences these\r\nholidays, let the affair be ever so important."\r\n\r\nThat a king should regularly have been put to death at the close of\r\na year\'s reign will hardly appear improbable when we learn that to\r\nthis day there is still a kingdom in which the reign and the life of\r\nthe sovereign are limited to a single day. In Ngoio, a province of\r\nthe ancient kingdom of Congo, the rule obtains that the chief who\r\nassumes the cap of sovereignty is always killed on the night after\r\nhis coronation. The right of succession lies with the chief of the\r\nMusurongo; but we need not wonder that he does not exercise it, and\r\nthat the throne stands vacant. "No one likes to lose his life for a\r\nfew hours\' glory on the Ngoio throne."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV. Temporary Kings\r\n\r\nIN SOME places the modified form of the old custom of regicide which\r\nappears to have prevailed at Babylon has been further softened down.\r\nThe king still abdicates annually for a short time and his place is\r\nfilled by a more or less nominal sovereign; but at the close of his\r\nshort reign the latter is no longer killed, though sometimes a mock\r\nexecution still survives as a memorial of the time when he was\r\nactually put to death. To take examples. In the month of M\xe9ac\r\n(February) the king of Cambodia annually abdicated for three days.\r\nDuring this time he performed no act of authority, he did not touch\r\nthe seals, he did not even receive the revenues which fell due. In\r\nhis stead there reigned a temporary king called Sdach M\xe9ac, that is,\r\nKing February. The office of temporary king was hereditary in a\r\nfamily distantly connected with the royal house, the sons succeeding\r\nthe fathers and the younger brothers the elder brothers just as in\r\nthe succession to the real sovereignty. On a favourable day fixed by\r\nthe astrologers the temporary king was conducted by the mandarins in\r\ntriumphal procession. He rode one of the royal elephants, seated in\r\nthe royal palanquin, and escorted by soldiers who, dressed in\r\nappropriate costumes, represented the neighbouring peoples of Siam,\r\nAnnam, Laos, and so on. In place of the golden crown he wore a\r\npeaked white cap, and his regalia, instead of being of gold\r\nencrusted with diamonds, were of rough wood. After paying homage to\r\nthe real king, from whom he received the sovereignty for three days,\r\ntogether with all the revenues accruing during that time (though\r\nthis last custom has been omitted for some time), he moved in\r\nprocession round the palace and through the streets of the capital.\r\nOn the third day, after the usual procession, the temporary king\r\ngave orders that the elephants should trample under foot the\r\n"mountain of rice," which was a scaffold of bamboo surrounded by\r\nsheaves of rice. The people gathered up the rice, each man taking\r\nhome a little with him to secure a good harvest. Some of it was also\r\ntaken to the king, who had it cooked and presented to the monks.\r\n\r\nIn Siam on the sixth day of the moon in the sixth month (the end of\r\nApril) a temporary king is appointed, who for three days enjoys the\r\nroyal prerogatives, the real king remaining shut up in his palace.\r\nThis temporary king sends his numerous satellites in all directions\r\nto seize and confiscate whatever they can find in the bazaar and\r\nopen shops; even the ships and junks which arrive in harbour during\r\nthe three days are forfeited to him and must be redeemed. He goes to\r\na field in the middle of the city, whither they bring a gilded\r\nplough drawn by gaily-decked oxen. After the plough has been\r\nanointed and the oxen rubbed with incense, the mock king traces nine\r\nfurrows with the plough, followed by aged dames of the palace\r\nscattering the first seed of the season. As soon as the nine furrows\r\nare drawn, the crowd of spectators rushes in and scrambles for the\r\nseed which has just been sown, believing that, mixed with the\r\nseed-rice, it will ensure a plentiful crop. Then the oxen are\r\nunyoked, and rice, maize, sesame, sago, bananas, sugar-cane, melons,\r\nand so on, are set before them; whatever they eat first will, it is\r\nthought, be dear in the year following, though some people interpret\r\nthe omen in the opposite sense. During this time the temporary king\r\nstands leaning against a tree with his right foot resting on his\r\nleft knee. From standing thus on one foot he is popularly known as\r\nKing Hop; but his official title is Phaya Phollathep "Lord of the\r\nHeavenly Hosts." He is a sort of Minister of Agriculture; all\r\ndisputes about fields, rice, and so forth, are referred to him.\r\nThere is moreover another ceremony in which he personates the king.\r\nIt takes place in the second month (which falls in the cold season)\r\nand lasts three days. He is conducted in procession to an open place\r\nopposite the Temple of the Brahmans, where there are a number of\r\npoles dressed like May-poles, upon which the Brahmans swing. All the\r\nwhile that they swing and dance, the Lord of the Heavenly Hosts has\r\nto stand on one foot upon a seat which is made of bricks plastered\r\nover, covered with a white cloth, and hung with tapestry. He is\r\nsupported by a wooden frame with a gilt canopy, and two Brahmans\r\nstand one on each side of him. The dancing Brahmans carry buffalo\r\nhorns with which they draw water from a large copper caldron and\r\nsprinkle it on the spectators; this is supposed to bring good luck,\r\ncausing the people to dwell in peace and quiet, health and\r\nprosperity. The time during which the Lord of the Heavenly Hosts has\r\nto stand on one foot is about three hours. This is thought "to prove\r\nthe dispositions of the Devattas and spirits." If he lets his foot\r\ndown "he is liable to forfeit his property and have his family\r\nenslaved by the king, as it is believed to be a bad omen, portending\r\ndestruction to the state, and instability to the throne. But if he\r\nstand firm he is believed to have gained a victory over evil\r\nspirits, and he has moreover the privilege, ostensibly at least, of\r\nseizing any ship which may enter the harbour during these three\r\ndays, and taking its contents, and also of entering any open shop in\r\nthe town and carrying away what he chooses."\r\n\r\nSuch were the duties and privileges of the Siamese King Hop down to\r\nabout the middle of the nineteenth century or later. Under the reign\r\nof the late enlightened monarch this quaint personage was to some\r\nextent both shorn of the glories and relieved of the burden of his\r\noffice. He still watches, as of old, the Brahmans rushing through\r\nthe air in a swing suspended between two tall masts, each some\r\nninety feet high; but he is allowed to sit instead of stand, and,\r\nalthough public opinion still expects him to keep his right foot on\r\nhis left knee during the whole of the ceremony, he would incur no\r\nlegal penalty were he, to the great chagrin of the people, to put\r\nhis weary foot to the ground. Other signs, too, tell of the invasion\r\nof the East by the ideas and civilisation of the West. The\r\nthoroughfares that lead to the scene of the performance are blocked\r\nwith carriages: lamp-posts and telegraph posts, to which eager\r\nspectators cling like monkeys, rise above the dense crowd; and,\r\nwhile a tatterdemalion band of the old style, in gaudy garb of\r\nvermilion and yellow, bangs and tootles away on drums and trumpets\r\nof an antique pattern, the procession of barefooted soldiers in\r\nbrilliant uniforms steps briskly along to the lively strains of a\r\nmodern military band playing "Marching through Georgia."\r\n\r\nOn the first day of the sixth month, which was regarded as the\r\nbeginning of the year, the king and people of Samarcand used to put\r\non new clothes and cut their hair and beards. Then they repaired to\r\na forest near the capital where they shot arrows on horseback for\r\nseven days. On the last day the target was a gold coin, and he who\r\nhit it had the right to be king for one day. In Upper Egypt on the\r\nfirst day of the solar year by Coptic reckoning, that is, on the\r\ntenth of September, when the Nile has generally reached its highest\r\npoint, the regular government is suspended for three days and every\r\ntown chooses its own ruler. This temporary lord wears a sort of tall\r\nfool\'s cap and a long flaxen beard, and is enveloped in a strange\r\nmantle. With a wand of office in his hand and attended by men\r\ndisguised as scribes, executioners, and so forth, he proceeds to the\r\nGovernor\'s house. The latter allows himself to be deposed; and the\r\nmock king, mounting the throne, holds a tribunal, to the decisions\r\nof which even the governor and his officials must bow. After three\r\ndays the mock king is condemned to death; the envelope or shell in\r\nwhich he was encased is committed to the flames, and from its ashes\r\nthe Fellah creeps forth. The custom perhaps points to an old\r\npractice of burning a real king in grim earnest. In Uganda the\r\nbrothers of the king used to be burned, because it was not lawful to\r\nshed the royal blood.\r\n\r\nThe Mohammedan students of Fez, in Morocco, are allowed to appoint a\r\nsultan of their own, who reigns for a few weeks, and is known as\r\n_Sultan t-tulba,_ "the Sultan of the Scribes." This brief authority\r\nis put up for auction and knocked down to the highest bidder. It\r\nbrings some substantial privileges with it, for the holder is freed\r\nfrom taxes thenceforward, and he has the right of asking a favour\r\nfrom the real sultan. That favour is seldom refused; it usually\r\nconsists in the release of a prisoner. Moreover, the agents of the\r\nstudent-sultan levy fines on the shopkeepers and householders,\r\nagainst whom they trump up various humorous charges. The temporary\r\nsultan is surrounded with the pomp of a real court, and parades the\r\nstreets in state with music and shouting, while a royal umbrella is\r\nheld over his head. With the so-called fines and free-will\r\nofferings, to which the real sultan adds a liberal supply of\r\nprovisions, the students have enough to furnish forth a magnificent\r\nbanquet; and altogether they enjoy themselves thoroughly, indulging\r\nin all kinds of games and amusements. For the first seven days the\r\nmock sultan remains in the college; then he goes about a mile out of\r\nthe town and encamps on the bank of the river, attended by the\r\nstudents and not a few of the citizens. On the seventh day of his\r\nstay outside the town he is visited by the real sultan, who grants\r\nhim his request and gives him seven more days to reign, so that the\r\nreign of "the Sultan of the Scribes" nominally lasts three weeks.\r\nBut when six days of the last week have passed the mock sultan runs\r\nback to the town by night. This temporary sultanship always falls in\r\nspring, about the beginning of April. Its origin is said to have\r\nbeen as follows. When Mulai Rasheed II. was fighting for the throne\r\nin 1664 or 1665, a certain Jew usurped the royal authority at Taza.\r\nBut the rebellion was soon suppressed through the loyalty and\r\ndevotion of the students. To effect their purpose they resorted to\r\nan ingenious stratagem. Forty of them caused themselves to be packed\r\nin chests which were sent as a present to the usurper. In the dead\r\nof night, while the unsuspecting Jew was slumbering peacefully among\r\nthe packing-cases, the lids were stealthily raised, the brave forty\r\ncrept forth, slew the usurper, and took possession of the city in\r\nthe name of the real sultan, who, to mark his gratitude for the help\r\nthus rendered him in time of need, conferred on the students the\r\nright of annually appointing a sultan of their own. The narrative\r\nhas all the air of a fiction devised to explain an old custom, of\r\nwhich the real meaning and origin had been forgotten.\r\n\r\nA custom of annually appointing a mock king for a single day was\r\nobserved at Lostwithiel in Cornwall down to the sixteenth century.\r\nOn "little Easter Sunday" the freeholders of the town and manor\r\nassembled together, either in person or by their deputies, and one\r\namong them, as it fell to his lot by turn, gaily attired and\r\ngallantly mounted, with a crown on his head, a sceptre in his hand,\r\nand a sword borne before him, rode through the principal street to\r\nthe church, dutifully attended by all the rest on horseback. The\r\nclergyman in his best robes received him at the churchyard stile and\r\nconducted him to hear divine service. On leaving the church he\r\nrepaired, with the same pomp, to a house provided for his reception.\r\nHere a feast awaited him and his suite, and being set at the head of\r\nthe table he was served on bended knees, with all the rites due to\r\nthe estate of a prince. The ceremony ended with the dinner, and\r\nevery man returned home.\r\n\r\nSometimes the temporary king occupies the throne, not annually, but\r\nonce for all at the beginning of each reign. Thus in the kingdom of\r\nJambi in Sumatra it is the custom that at the beginning of a new\r\nreign a man of the people should occupy the throne and exercise the\r\nroyal prerogatives for a single day. The origin of the custom is\r\nexplained by a tradition that there were once five royal brothers,\r\nthe four elder of whom all declined the throne on the ground of\r\nvarious bodily defects, leaving it to their youngest brother. But\r\nthe eldest occupied the throne for one day, and reserved for his\r\ndescendants a similar privilege at the beginning of every reign.\r\nThus the office of temporary king is hereditary in a family akin to\r\nthe royal house. In Bilaspur it seems to be the custom, after the\r\ndeath of a Rajah, for a Brahman to eat rice out of the dead Rajah\'s\r\nhand, and then to occupy the throne for a year. At the end of the\r\nyear the Brahman receives presents and is dismissed from the\r\nterritory, being forbidden apparently to return. "The idea seems to\r\nbe that the spirit of the R\xe1j\xe1 enters into the Br\xe1hman who eats the\r\n_khir_ (rice and milk) out of his hand when he is dead, as the\r\nBrahman is apparently carefully watched during the whole year, and\r\nnot allowed to go away." The same or a similar custom is believed to\r\nobtain among the hill states about Kangra. The custom of banishing\r\nthe Brahman who represents the king may be a substitute for putting\r\nhim to death. At the installation of a prince of Carinthia a\r\npeasant, in whose family the office was hereditary, ascended a\r\nmarble stone which stood surrounded by meadows in a spacious valley;\r\non his right stood a black mother-cow, on his left a lean ugly mare.\r\nA rustic crowd gathered about him. Then the future prince, dressed\r\nas a peasant and carrying a shepherd\'s staff, drew near, attended by\r\ncourtiers and magistrates. On perceiving him the peasant called out,\r\n"Who is this whom I see coming so proudly along?" The people\r\nanswered, "The prince of the land." The peasant was then prevailed\r\non to surrender the marble seat to the prince on condition of\r\nreceiving sixty pence, the cow and mare, and exemption from taxes.\r\nBut before yielding his place he gave the prince a light blow on the\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\nSome points about these temporary kings deserve to be specially\r\nnoticed before we pass to the next branch of the evidence. In the\r\nfirst place, the Cambodian and Siamese examples show clearly that it\r\nis especially the divine or magical functions of the king which are\r\ntransferred to his temporary substitute. This appears from the\r\nbelief that by keeping up his foot the temporary king of Siam gained\r\na victory over the evil spirits, whereas by letting it down he\r\nimperilled the existence of the state. Again, the Cambodian ceremony\r\nof trampling down the "mountain of rice," and the Siamese ceremony\r\nof opening the ploughing and sowing, are charms to produce a\r\nplentiful harvest, as appears from the belief that those who carry\r\nhome some of the trampled rice, or of the seed sown, will thereby\r\nsecure a good crop. Moreover, when the Siamese representative of the\r\nking is guiding the plough, the people watch him anxiously, not to\r\nsee whether he drives a straight furrow, but to mark the exact point\r\non his leg to which the skirt of his silken robe reaches; for on\r\nthat is supposed to hang the state of the weather and the crops\r\nduring the ensuing season. If the Lord of the Heavenly Hosts hitches\r\nup his garment above his knee, the weather will be wet and heavy\r\nrains will spoil the harvest. If he lets it trail to his ankle, a\r\ndrought will be the consequence. But fine weather and heavy crops\r\nwill follow if the hem of his robe hangs exactly half-way down the\r\ncalf of his leg. So closely is the course of nature, and with it the\r\nweal or woe of the people, dependent on the minutest act or gesture\r\nof the king\'s representative. But the task of making the crops grow,\r\nthus deputed to the temporary kings, is one of the magical functions\r\nregularly supposed to be discharged by kings in primitive society.\r\nThe rule that the mock king must stand on one foot upon a raised\r\nseat in the rice-field was perhaps originally meant as a charm to\r\nmake the crop grow high; at least this was the object of a similar\r\nceremony observed by the old Prussians. The tallest girl, standing\r\non one foot upon a seat, with her lap full of cakes, a cup of brandy\r\nin her right hand and a piece of elm-bark or linden-bark in her\r\nleft, prayed to the god Waizganthos that the flax might grow as high\r\nas she was standing. Then, after draining the cup, she had it\r\nrefilled, and poured the brandy on the ground as an offering to\r\nWaizganthos, and threw down the cakes for his attendant sprites. If\r\nshe remained steady on one foot throughout the ceremony, it was an\r\nomen that the flax crop would be good; but if she let her foot down,\r\nit was feared that the crop might fail. The same significance\r\nperhaps attaches to the swinging of the Brahmans, which the Lord of\r\nthe Heavenly Hosts had formerly to witness standing on one foot. On\r\nthe principles of homoeopathic or imitative magic it might be\r\nthought that the higher the priests swing the higher will grow the\r\nrice. For the ceremony is described as a harvest festival, and\r\nswinging is practised by the Letts of Russia with the avowed\r\nintention of influencing the growth of the crops. In the spring and\r\nearly summer, between Easter and St. John\'s Day (the summer\r\nsolstice), every Lettish peasant is said to devote his leisure hours\r\nto swinging diligently; for the higher he rises in the air the\r\nhigher will his flax grow that season.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing cases the temporary king is appointed annually in\r\naccordance with a regular custom. But in other cases the appointment\r\nis made only to meet a special emergency, such as to relieve the\r\nreal king from some actual or threatened evil by diverting it to a\r\nsubstitute, who takes his place on the throne for a short time. The\r\nhistory of Persia furnishes instances of such occasional substitutes\r\nfor the Shah. Thus Shah Abbas the Great, being warned by his\r\nastrologers in the year 1591 that a serious danger impended over\r\nhim, attempted to avert the omen by abdicating the throne and\r\nappointing a certain unbeliever named Yusoofee, probably a\r\nChristian, to reign in his stead. The substitute was accordingly\r\ncrowned, and for three days, if we may trust the Persian historians,\r\nhe enjoyed not only the name and the state but the power of the\r\nking. At the end of his brief reign he was put to death: the decree\r\nof the stars was fulfilled by this sacrifice; and Abbas, who\r\nreascended his throne in a most propitious hour, was promised by his\r\nastrologers a long and glorious reign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI. Sacrifice of the King\'s Son\r\n\r\nA POINT to notice about the temporary kings described in the\r\nforegoing chapter is that in two places (Cambodia and Jambi) they\r\ncome of a stock which is believed to be akin to the royal family. If\r\nthe view here taken of the origin of these temporary kingships is\r\ncorrect, we can easily understand why the king\'s substitute should\r\nsometimes be of the same race as the king. When the king first\r\nsucceeded in getting the life of another accepted as a sacrifice\r\ninstead of his own, he would have to show that the death of that\r\nother would serve the purpose quite as well as his own would have\r\ndone. Now it was as a god or demigod that the king had to die;\r\ntherefore the substitute who died for him had to be invested, at\r\nleast for the occasion, with the divine attributes of the king.\r\nThis, as we have just seen, was certainly the case with the\r\ntemporary kings of Siam and Cambodia; they were invested with the\r\nsupernatural functions, which in an earlier stage of society were\r\nthe special attributes of the king. But no one could so well\r\nrepresent the king in his divine character as his son, who might be\r\nsupposed to share the divine afflatus of his father. No one,\r\ntherefore, could so appropriately die for the king and, through him,\r\nfor the whole people, as the king\'s son.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that according to tradition, Aun or On, King of Sweden,\r\nsacrificed nine of his sons to Odin at Upsala in order that his own\r\nlife might be spared. After he had sacrificed his second son he\r\nreceived from the god an answer that he should live so long as he\r\ngave him one of his sons every ninth year. When he had sacrificed\r\nhis seventh son, he still lived, but was so feeble that he could not\r\nwalk but had to be carried in a chair. Then he offered up his eighth\r\nson, and lived nine years more, lying in his bed. After that he\r\nsacrificed his ninth son, and lived another nine years, but so that\r\nhe drank out of a horn like a weaned child. He now wished to\r\nsacrifice his only remaining son to Odin, but the Swedes would not\r\nallow him. So he died and was buried in a mound at Upsala.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Greece there seems to have been at least one kingly house\r\nof great antiquity of which the eldest sons were always liable to be\r\nsacrificed in room of their royal sires. When Xerxes was marching\r\nthrough Thessaly at the head of his mighty host to attack the\r\nSpartans at Thermopylae, he came to the town of Alus. Here he was\r\nshown the sanctuary of Laphystian Zeus, about which his guides told\r\nhim a strange tale. It ran somewhat as follows. Once upon a time the\r\nking of the country, by name Athamas, married a wife Nephele, and\r\nhad by her a son called Phrixus and a daughter named Helle.\r\nAfterwards he took to himself a second wife called Ino, by whom he\r\nhad two sons, Learchus and Melicertes. But his second wife was\r\njealous of her stepchildren, Phrixus and Helle, and plotted their\r\ndeath. She went about very cunningly to compass her bad end. First\r\nof all she persuaded the women of the country to roast the seed corn\r\nsecretly before it was committed to the ground. So next year no\r\ncrops came up and the people died of famine. Then the king sent\r\nmessengers to the oracle at Delphi to enquire the cause of the\r\ndearth. But the wicked stepmother bribed the messenger to give out\r\nas the answer of the god that the dearth would never cease till the\r\nchildren of Athamas by his first wife had been sacrificed to Zeus.\r\nWhen Athamas heard that, he sent for the children, who were with the\r\nsheep. But a ram with a fleece of gold opened his lips, and speaking\r\nwith the voice of a man warned the children of their danger. So they\r\nmounted the ram and fled with him over land and sea. As they flew\r\nover the sea, the girl slipped from the animal\'s back, and falling\r\ninto water was drowned. But her brother Phrixus was brought safe to\r\nthe land of Colchis, where reigned a child of the sun. Phrixus\r\nmarried the king\'s daughter, and she bore him a son Cytisorus. And\r\nthere he sacrificed the ram with the golden fleece to Zeus the God\r\nof Flight; but some will have it that he sacrificed the animal to\r\nLaphystian Zeus. The golden fleece itself he gave to his wife\'s\r\nfather, who nailed it to an oak tree, guarded by a sleepless dragon\r\nin a sacred grove of Ares. Meanwhile at home an oracle had commanded\r\nthat King Athamas himself should be sacrificed as an expiatory\r\noffering for the whole country. So the people decked him with\r\ngarlands like a victim and led him to the altar, where they were\r\njust about to sacrifice him when he was rescued either by his\r\ngrandson Cytisorus, who arrived in the nick of time from Colchis, or\r\nby Hercules, who brought tidings that the king\'s son Phrixus was yet\r\nalive. Thus Athamas was saved, but afterward he went mad, and\r\nmistaking his son Learchus for a wild beast, shot him dead. Next he\r\nattempted the life of his remaining son Melicertes, but the child\r\nwas rescued by his mother Ino, who ran and threw herself and him\r\nfrom a high rock into the sea. Mother and son were changed into\r\nmarine divinities, and the son received special homage in the isle\r\nof Tenedos, where babes were sacrificed to him. Thus bereft of wife\r\nand children the unhappy Athamas quitted his country, and on\r\nenquiring of the oracle where he should dwell was told to take up\r\nhis abode wherever he should be entertained by wild beasts. He fell\r\nin with a pack of wolves devouring sheep, and when they saw him they\r\nfled and left him the bleeding remnants of their prey. In this way\r\nthe oracle was fulfilled. But because King Athamas had not been\r\nsacrificed as a sin-offering for the whole country, it was divinely\r\ndecreed that the eldest male scion of his family in each generation\r\nshould be sacrificed without fail, if ever he set foot in the\r\ntown-hall, where the offerings were made to Laphystian Zeus by one\r\nof the house of Athamas. Many of the family, Xerxes was informed,\r\nhad fled to foreign lands to escape this doom; but some of them had\r\nreturned long afterwards, and being caught by the sentinels in the\r\nact of entering the town-hall were wreathed as victims, led forth in\r\nprocession, and sacrificed. These instances appear to have been\r\nnotorious, if not frequent; for the writer of a dialogue attributed\r\nto Plato, after speaking of the immolation of human victims by the\r\nCarthaginians, adds that such practices were not unknown among the\r\nGreeks, and he refers with horror to the sacrifices offered on Mount\r\nLycaeus and by the descendants of Athamas.\r\n\r\nThe suspicion that this barbarous custom by no means fell into\r\ndisuse even in later days is strengthened by a case of human\r\nsacrifice which occurred in Plutarch\'s time at Orchomenus, a very\r\nancient city of Boeotia, distant only a few miles across the plain\r\nfrom the historian\'s birthplace. Here dwelt a family of which the\r\nmen went by the name of Psoloeis or "Sooty," and the women by the\r\nname of Oleae or "Destructive." Every year at the festival of the\r\nAgrionia the priest of Dionysus pursued these women with a drawn\r\nsword, and if he overtook one of them he had the right to slay her.\r\nIn Plutarch\'s lifetime the right was actually exercised by a priest\r\nZoilus. The family thus liable to furnish at least one human victim\r\nevery year was of royal descent, for they traced their lineage to\r\nMinyas, the famous old king of Orchomenus, the monarch of fabulous\r\nwealth, whose stately treasury, as it is called, still stands in\r\nruins at the point where the long rocky hill of Orchomenus melts\r\ninto the vast level expanse of the Copaic plain. Tradition ran that\r\nthe king\'s three daughters long despised the other women of the\r\ncountry for yielding to the Bacchic frenzy, and sat at home in the\r\nking\'s house scornfully plying the distaff and the loom, while the\r\nrest, wreathed with flowers, their dishevelled locks streaming to\r\nthe wind, roamed in ecstasy the barren mountains that rise above\r\nOrchomenus, making the solitude of the hills to echo to the wild\r\nmusic of cymbals and tambourines. But in time the divine fury\r\ninfected even the royal damsels in their quiet chamber; they were\r\nseized with a fierce longing to partake of human flesh, and cast\r\nlots among themselves which should give up her child to furnish a\r\ncannibal feast. The lot fell on Leucippe, and she surrendered her\r\nson Hippasus, who was torn limb from limb by the three. From these\r\nmisguided women sprang the Oleae and the Psoloeis, of whom the men\r\nwere said to be so called because they wore sad-coloured raiment in\r\ntoken of their mourning and grief.\r\n\r\nNow this practice of taking human victims from a family of royal\r\ndescent at Orchomenus is all the more significant because Athamas\r\nhimself is said to have reigned in the land of Orchomenus even\r\nbefore the time of Minyas, and because over against the city there\r\nrises Mount Laphystius, on which, as at Alus in Thessaly, there was\r\na sanctuary of Laphystian Zeus, where, according to tradition,\r\nAthamas purposed to sacrifice his two children Phrixus and Helle. On\r\nthe whole, comparing the traditions about Athamas with the custom\r\nthat obtained with regard to his descendants in historical times, we\r\nmay fairly infer that in Thessaly and probably in Boeotia there\r\nreigned of old a dynasty of which the kings were liable to be\r\nsacrificed for the good of the country to the god called Laphystian\r\nZeus, but that they contrived to shift the fatal responsibility to\r\ntheir offspring, of whom the eldest son was regularly destined to\r\nthe altar. As time went on, the cruel custom was so far mitigated\r\nthat a ram was accepted as a vicarious sacrifice in room of the\r\nroyal victim, provided always that the prince abstained from setting\r\nfoot in the town-hall where the sacrifices were offered to\r\nLaphystian Zeus by one of his kinsmen. But if he were rash enough to\r\nenter the place of doom, to thrust himself wilfully, as it were, on\r\nthe notice of the god who had good-naturedly winked at the\r\nsubstitution of a ram, the ancient obligation which had been\r\nsuffered to lie in abeyance recovered all its force, and there was\r\nno help for it but he must die. The tradition which associated the\r\nsacrifice of the king or his children with a great dearth points\r\nclearly to the belief, so common among primitive folk, that the king\r\nis responsible for the weather and the crops, and that he may justly\r\npay with his life for the inclemency of the one or the failure of\r\nthe other. Athamas and his line, in short, appear to have united\r\ndivine or magical with royal functions; and this view is strongly\r\nsupported by the claims to divinity which Salmoneus, the brother of\r\nAthamas, is said to have set up. We have seen that this presumptuous\r\nmortal professed to be no other than Zeus himself, and to wield the\r\nthunder and lightning, of which he made a trumpery imitation by the\r\nhelp of tinkling kettles and blazing torches. If we may judge from\r\nanalogy, his mock thunder and lightning were no mere scenic\r\nexhibition designed to deceive and impress the beholders; they were\r\nenchantments practised by the royal magician for the purpose of\r\nbringing about the celestial phenomena which they feebly mimicked.\r\n\r\nAmong the Semites of Western Asia the king, in a time of national\r\ndanger, sometimes gave his own son to die as a sacrifice for the\r\npeople. Thus Philo of Byblus, in his work on the Jews, says: "It was\r\nan ancient custom in a crisis of great danger that the ruler of a\r\ncity or nation should give his beloved son to die for the whole\r\npeople, as a ransom offered to the avenging demons; and the children\r\nthus offered were slain with mystic rites. So Cronus, whom the\r\nPhoenicians call Israel, being king of the land and having an\r\nonly-begotten son called Jeoud (for in the Phoenician tongue Jeoud\r\nsignifies \'only begotten\'), dressed him in royal robes and\r\nsacrificed him upon an altar in a time of war, when the country was\r\nin great danger from the enemy." When the king of Moab was besieged\r\nby the Israelites and hard beset, he took his eldest son, who should\r\nhave reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering on\r\nthe wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII. Succession to the Soul\r\n\r\nTO THE VIEW that in early times, and among barbarous races, kings\r\nhave frequently been put to death at the end of a short reign, it\r\nmay be objected that such a custom would tend to the extinction of\r\nthe royal family. The objection may be met by observing, first, that\r\nthe kingship is often not confined to one family, but may be shared\r\nin turn by several; second, that the office is frequently not\r\nhereditary, but is open to men of any family, even to foreigners,\r\nwho may fulfil the requisite conditions, such as marrying a princess\r\nor vanquishing the king in battle; and, third, that even if the\r\ncustom did tend to the extinction of a dynasty, that is not a\r\nconsideration which would prevent its observance among people less\r\nprovident of the future and less heedful of human life than\r\nourselves. Many races, like many individuals, have indulged in\r\npractices which must in the end destroy them. The Polynesians seem\r\nregularly to have killed two-thirds of their children. In some parts\r\nof East Africa the proportion of infants massacred at birth is said\r\nto be the same. Only children born in certain presentations are\r\nallowed to live. The Jagas, a conquering tribe in Angola, are\r\nreported to have put to death all their children, without exception,\r\nin order that the women might not be cumbered with babies on the\r\nmarch. They recruited their numbers by adopting boys and girls of\r\nthirteen or fourteen years of age, whose parents they had killed and\r\neaten. Among the Mbaya Indians of South America the women used to\r\nmurder all their children except the last, or the one they believed\r\nto be the last. If one of them had another child afterwards, she\r\nkilled it. We need not wonder that this practice entirely destroyed\r\na branch of the Mbaya nation, who had been for many years the most\r\nformidable enemies of the Spaniards. Among the Lengua Indians of the\r\nGran Chaco, the missionaries discovered what they describe as "a\r\ncarefully planned system of racial suicide, by the practice of\r\ninfanticide by abortion, and other methods." Nor is infanticide the\r\nonly mode in which a savage tribe commits suicide. A lavish use of\r\nthe poison ordeal may be equally effective. Some time ago a small\r\ntribe named Uwet came down from the hill country, and settled on the\r\nleft branch of the Calabar River in West Africa. When the\r\nmissionaries first visited the place, they found the population\r\nconsiderable, distributed into three villages. Since then the\r\nconstant use of the poison ordeal has almost extinguished the tribe.\r\nOn one occasion the whole population took poison to prove their\r\ninnocence. About half perished on the spot, and the remnant, we are\r\ntold, still continuing their superstitious practice, must soon\r\nbecome extinct. With such examples before us we need not hesitate to\r\nbelieve that many tribes have felt no scruple or delicacy in\r\nobserving a custom which tends to wipe out a single family. To\r\nattribute such scruples to them is to commit the common, the\r\nperpetually repeated mistake of judging the savage by the standard\r\nof European civilisation. If any of my readers set out with the\r\nnotion that all races of men think and act much in the same way as\r\neducated Englishmen, the evidence of superstitious belief and custom\r\ncollected in this work should suffice to disabuse him of so\r\nerroneous a prepossession.\r\n\r\nThe explanation here given of the custom of killing divine persons\r\nassumes, or at least is readily combined with, the idea that the\r\nsoul of the slain divinity is transmitted to his successor. Of this\r\ntransmission I have no direct proof except in the case of the\r\nShilluk, among whom the practice of killing the divine king prevails\r\nin a typical form, and with whom it is a fundamental article of\r\nfaith that the soul of the divine founder of the dynasty is immanent\r\nin every one of his slain successors. But if this is the only actual\r\nexample of such a belief which I can adduce, analogy seems to render\r\nit probable that a similar succession to the soul of the slain god\r\nhas been supposed to take place in other instances, though direct\r\nevidence of it is wanting. For it has been already shown that the\r\nsoul of the incarnate deity is often supposed to transmigrate at\r\ndeath into another incarnation; and if this takes place when the\r\ndeath is a natural one, there seems no reason why it should not take\r\nplace when the death has been brought about by violence. Certainly\r\nthe idea that the soul of a dying person may be transmitted to his\r\nsuccessor is perfectly familiar to primitive peoples. In Nias the\r\neldest son usually succeeds his father in the chieftainship. But if\r\nfrom any bodily or mental defect the eldest son is disqualified for\r\nruling, the father determines in his lifetime which of his sons\r\nshall succeed him. In order, however, to establish his right of\r\nsuccession, it is necessary that the son upon whom his father\'s\r\nchoice falls shall catch in his mouth or in a bag the last breath,\r\nand with it the soul, of the dying chief. For whoever catches his\r\nlast breath is chief equally with the appointed successor. Hence the\r\nother brothers, and sometimes also strangers, crowd round the dying\r\nman to catch his soul as it passes. The houses in Nias are raised\r\nabove the ground on posts, and it has happened that when the dying\r\nman lay with his face on the floor, one of the candidates has bored\r\na hole in the floor and sucked in the chief\'s last breath through a\r\nbamboo tube. When the chief has no son, his soul is caught in a bag,\r\nwhich is fastened to an image made to represent the deceased; the\r\nsoul is then believed to pass into the image.\r\n\r\nSometimes it would appear that the spiritual link between a king and\r\nthe souls of his predecessors is formed by the possession of some\r\npart of their persons. In southern Celebes the regalia often consist\r\nof corporeal portions of deceased rajahs, which are treasured as\r\nsacred relics and confer the right to the throne. Similarly among\r\nthe Sakalavas of southern Madagascar a vertebra of the neck, a nail,\r\nand a lock of hair of a deceased king are placed in a crocodile\'s\r\ntooth and carefully kept along with the similar relics of his\r\npredecessors in a house set apart for the purpose. The possession of\r\nthese relics constitutes the right to the throne. A legitimate heir\r\nwho should be deprived of them would lose all his authority over the\r\npeople, and on the contrary a usurper who should make himself master\r\nof the relics would be acknowledged king without dispute. When the\r\nAlake or king of Abeokuta in West Africa dies, the principal men\r\ndecapitate his body, and placing the head in a large earthen vessel\r\ndeliver it to the new sovereign; it becomes his fetish and he is\r\nbound to pay it honours. Sometimes, in order apparently that the new\r\nsovereign may inherit more surely the magical and other virtues of\r\nthe royal line, he is required to eat a piece of his dead\r\npredecessor. Thus at Abeokuta not only was the head of the late king\r\npresented to his successor, but the tongue was cut out and given him\r\nto eat. Hence, when the natives wish to signify that the sovereign\r\nreigns, they say, "He has eaten the king." A custom of the same sort\r\nis still practised at Ibadan, a large town in the interior of Lagos,\r\nWest Africa. When the king dies his head is cut off and sent to his\r\nnominal suzerain, the Alafin of Oyo, the paramount king of Yoruba\r\nland; but his heart is eaten by his successor. This ceremony was\r\nperformed not very many years ago at the accession of a new king of\r\nIbadan.\r\n\r\nTaking the whole of the preceding evidence into account, we may\r\nfairly suppose that when the divine king or priest is put to death\r\nhis spirit is believed to pass into his successor. In point of fact,\r\namong the Shilluk of the White Nile, who regularly kill their divine\r\nkings, every king on his accession has to perform a ceremony which\r\nappears designed to convey to him the same sacred and worshipful\r\nspirit which animated all his predecessors, one after the other, on\r\nthe throne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII. The Killing of the Tree-Spirit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Whitsuntide Mummers\r\n\r\nIT remains to ask what light the custom of killing the divine king\r\nor priest sheds upon the special subject to our enquiry. In an\r\nearlier part of this work we saw reason to suppose that the King of\r\nthe Wood at Nemi was regarded as an incarnation of a tree-spirit or\r\nof the spirit of vegetation, and that as such he would be endowed,\r\nin the belief of his worshippers, with a magical power of making the\r\ntrees to bear fruit, the crops to grow, and so on. His life must\r\ntherefore have been held very precious by his worshippers, and was\r\nprobably hedged in by a system of elaborate precautions or taboos\r\nlike those by which, in so many places, the life of the man-god has\r\nbeen guarded against the malignant influence of demons and\r\nsorcerers. But we have seen that the very value attached to the life\r\nof the man-god necessitates his violent death as the only means of\r\npreserving it from the inevitable decay of age. The same reasoning\r\nwould apply to the King of the Wood; he, too, had to be killed in\r\norder that the divine spirit, incarnate in him, might be transferred\r\nin its integrity to his successor. The rule that he held office till\r\na stronger should slay him might be supposed to secure both the\r\npreservation of his divine life in full vigour and its transference\r\nto a suitable successor as soon as that vigour began to be impaired.\r\nFor so long as he could maintain his position by the strong hand, it\r\nmight be inferred that his natural force was not abated; whereas his\r\ndefeat and death at the hands of another proved that his strength\r\nwas beginning to fail and that it was time his divine life should be\r\nlodged in a less dilapidated tabernacle. This explanation of the\r\nrule that the King of the Wood had to be slain by his successor at\r\nleast renders that rule perfectly intelligible. It is strongly\r\nsupported by the theory and practice of the Shilluk, who put their\r\ndivine king to death at the first signs of failing health, lest his\r\ndecrepitude should entail a corresponding failure of vital energy on\r\nthe corn, the cattle, and men. Moreover, it is countenanced by the\r\nanalogy of the Chitom\xe9, upon whose life the existence of the world\r\nwas supposed to hang, and who was therefore slain by his successor\r\nas soon as he showed signs of breaking up. Again, the terms on which\r\nin later times the King of Calicut held office are identical with\r\nthose attached to the office of King of the Wood, except that\r\nwhereas the former might be assailed by a candidate at any time, the\r\nKing of Calicut might only be attacked once every twelve years. But\r\nas the leave granted to the King of Calicut to reign so long as he\r\ncould defend himself against all comers was a mitigation of the old\r\nrule which set a fixed term to his life, so we may conjecture that\r\nthe similar permission granted to the King of the Wood was a\r\nmitigation of an older custom of putting him to death at the end of\r\na definite period. In both cases the new rule gave to the god-man at\r\nleast a chance for his life, which under the old rule was denied\r\nhim; and people probably reconciled themselves to the change by\r\nreflecting that so long as the god-man could maintain himself by the\r\nsword against all assaults, there was no reason to apprehend that\r\nthe fatal decay had set in.\r\n\r\nThe conjecture that the King of the Wood was formerly put to death\r\nat the expiry of a fixed term, without being allowed a chance for\r\nhis life, will be confirmed if evidence can be adduced of a custom\r\nof periodically killing his counterparts, the human representatives\r\nof the tree-spirit, in Northern Europe. Now in point of fact such a\r\ncustom has left unmistakable traces of itself in the rural festivals\r\nof the peasantry. To take examples.\r\n\r\nAt Niederp\xf6ring, in Lower Bavaria, the Whitsuntide representative of\r\nthe tree-spirit--the _Pfingstl_ as he was called--was clad from top\r\nto toe in leaves and flowers. On his head he wore a high pointed\r\ncap, the ends of which rested on his shoulders, only two holes being\r\nleft in it for his eyes. The cap was covered with water-flowers and\r\nsurmounted with a nosegay of peonies. The sleeves of his coat were\r\nalso made of water-plants, and the rest of his body was enveloped in\r\nalder and hazel leaves. On each side of him marched a boy holding up\r\none of the _Pfingstl\'s_ arms. These two boys carried drawn swords,\r\nand so did most of the others who formed the procession. They\r\nstopped at every house where they hoped to receive a present; and\r\nthe people, in hiding, soused the leaf-clad boy with water. All\r\nrejoiced when he was well drenched. Finally he waded into the brook\r\nup to his middle; whereupon one of the boys, standing on the bridge,\r\npretended to cut off his head. At Wurmlingen, in Swabia, a score of\r\nyoung fellows dress themselves on Whit-Monday in white shirts and\r\nwhite trousers, with red scarves round their waists and swords\r\nhanging from the scarves. They ride on horseback into the wood, led\r\nby two trumpeters blowing their trumpets. In the wood they cut down\r\nleafy oak branches, in which they envelop from head to foot him who\r\nwas the last of their number to ride out of the village. His legs,\r\nhowever, are encased separately, so that he may be able to mount his\r\nhorse again. Further, they give him a long artificial neck, with an\r\nartificial head and a false face on the top of it. Then a May-tree\r\nis cut, generally an aspen or beech about ten feet high; and being\r\ndecked with coloured handkerchiefs and ribbons it is entrusted to a\r\nspecial "May-bearer." The cavalcade then returns with music and song\r\nto the village. Amongst the personages who figure in the procession\r\nare a Moorish king with a sooty face and a crown on his head, a Dr.\r\nIron-Beard, a corporal, and an executioner. They halt on the village\r\ngreen, and each of the characters makes a speech in rhyme. The\r\nexecutioner announces that the leaf-clad man has been condemned to\r\ndeath, and cuts off his false head. Then the riders race to the\r\nMay-tree, which has been set up a little way off. The first man who\r\nsucceeds in wrenching it from the ground as he gallops past keeps it\r\nwith all its decorations. The ceremony is observed every second or\r\nthird year.\r\n\r\nIn Saxony and Th\xfcringen there is a Whitsuntide ceremony called\r\n"chasing the Wild Man out of the bush," or "fetching the Wild Man\r\nout of the wood." A young fellow is enveloped in leaves or moss and\r\ncalled the Wild Man. He hides in the wood and the other lads of the\r\nvillage go out to seek him. They find him, lead him captive out of\r\nthe wood, and fire at him with blank muskets. He falls like dead to\r\nthe ground, but a lad dressed as a doctor bleeds him, and he comes\r\nto life again. At this they rejoice, and, binding him fast on a\r\nwaggon, take him to the village, where they tell all the people how\r\nthey have caught the Wild Man. At every house they receive a gift.\r\nIn the Erzgebirge the following custom was annually observed at\r\nShrovetide about the beginning of the seventeenth century. Two men\r\ndisguised as Wild Men, the one in brushwood and moss, the other in\r\nstraw, were led about the streets, and at last taken to the\r\nmarket-place, where they were chased up and down, shot and stabbed.\r\nBefore falling they reeled about with strange gestures and spirted\r\nblood on the people from bladders which they carried. When they were\r\ndown, the huntsmen placed them on boards and carried them to the\r\nale-house, the miners marching beside them and winding blasts on\r\ntheir mining tools as if they had taken a noble head of game. A very\r\nsimilar Shrovetide custom is still observed near Schluckenau in\r\nBohemia. A man dressed up as a Wild Man is chased through several\r\nstreets till he comes to a narrow lane across which a cord is\r\nstretched. He stumbles over the cord and, falling to the ground, is\r\novertaken and caught by his pursuers. The executioner runs up and\r\nstabs with his sword a bladder filled with blood which the Wild Man\r\nwears round his body; so the Wild Man dies, while a stream of blood\r\nreddens the ground. Next day a straw-man, made up to look like the\r\nWild Man, is placed on a litter, and, accompanied by a great crowd,\r\nis taken to a pool into which it is thrown by the executioner. The\r\nceremony is called "burying the Carnival."\r\n\r\nIn Semic (Bohemia) the custom of beheading the King is observed on\r\nWhit-Monday. A troop of young people disguise themselves; each is\r\ngirt with a girdle of bark and carries a wooden sword and a trumpet\r\nof willow-bark. The King wears a robe of tree-bark adorned with\r\nflowers, on his head is a crown of bark decked with flowers and\r\nbranches, his feet are wound about with ferns, a mask hides his\r\nface, and for a sceptre he has a hawthorn switch in his hand. A lad\r\nleads him through the village by a rope fastened to his foot, while\r\nthe rest dance about, blow their trumpets, and whistle. In every\r\nfarmhouse the King is chased round the room, and one of the troop,\r\namid much noise and outcry, strikes with his sword a blow on the\r\nKing\'s robe of bark till it rings again. Then a gratuity is\r\ndemanded. The ceremony of decapitation, which is here somewhat\r\nslurred over, is carried out with a greater semblance of reality in\r\nother parts of Bohemia. Thus in some villages of the K\xf6niggr\xe4tz\r\ndistrict on Whit-Monday the girls assemble under one lime-tree and\r\nthe young men under another, all dressed in their best and tricked\r\nout with ribbons. The young men twine a garland for the Queen, and\r\nthe girls another for the King. When they have chosen the King and\r\nQueen they all go in procession two and two, to the ale-house, from\r\nthe balcony of which the crier proclaims the names of the King and\r\nQueen. Both are then invested with the insignia of their office and\r\nare crowned with the garlands, while the music plays up. Then some\r\none gets on a bench and accuses the King of various offences, such\r\nas ill-treating the cattle. The King appeals to witnesses and a\r\ntrial ensues, at the close of which the judge, who carries a white\r\nwand as his badge of office, pronounces a verdict of "Guilty," or\r\n"Not guilty." If the verdict is "Guilty," the judge breaks his wand,\r\nthe King kneels on a white cloth, all heads are bared, and a soldier\r\nsets three or four hats, one above the other, on his Majesty\'s head.\r\nThe judge then pronounces the word "Guilty" thrice in a loud voice,\r\nand orders the crier to behead the King. The crier obeys by striking\r\noff the King\'s hats with the wooden sword.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps, for our purpose, the most instructive of these mimic\r\nexecutions is the following Bohemian one. In some places of the\r\nPilsen district (Bohemia) on Whit-Monday the King is dressed in\r\nbark, ornamented with flowers and ribbons; he wears a crown of gilt\r\npaper and rides a horse, which is also decked with flowers. Attended\r\nby a judge, an executioner, and other characters, and followed by a\r\ntrain of soldiers, all mounted, he rides to the village square,\r\nwhere a hut or arbour of green boughs has been erected under the\r\nMay-trees, which are firs, freshly cut, peeled to the top, and\r\ndressed with flowers and ribbons. After the dames and maidens of the\r\nvillage have been criticised and a frog beheaded, the cavalcade\r\nrides to a place previously determined upon, in a straight, broad\r\nstreet. Here they draw up in two lines and the King takes to flight.\r\nHe is given a short start and rides off at full speed, pursued by\r\nthe whole troop. If they fail to catch him he remains King for\r\nanother year, and his companions must pay his score at the ale-house\r\nin the evening. But if they overtake and catch him he is scourged\r\nwith hazel rods or beaten with the wooden swords and compelled to\r\ndismount. Then the executioner asks, "Shall I behead this King?" The\r\nanswer is given, "Behead him"; the executioner brandishes his axe,\r\nand with the words, "One, two, three, let the King headless be!" he\r\nstrikes off the King\'s crown. Amid the loud cries of the bystanders\r\nthe King sinks to the ground; then he is laid on a bier and carried\r\nto the nearest farmhouse.\r\n\r\nIn most of the personages who are thus slain in mimicry it is\r\nimpossible not to recognise representatives of the tree-spirit or\r\nspirit of vegetation, as he is supposed to manifest himself in\r\nspring. The bark, leaves, and flowers in which the actors are\r\ndressed, and the season of the year at which they appear, show that\r\nthey belong to the same class as the Grass King, King of the May,\r\nJack-in-the-Green, and other representatives of the vernal spirit of\r\nvegetation which we examined in an earlier part of this work. As if\r\nto remove any possible doubt on this head, we find that in two cases\r\nthese slain men are brought into direct connexion with May-trees,\r\nwhich are the impersonal, as the May King, Grass King, and so forth,\r\nare the personal representatives of the tree-spirit. The drenching\r\nof the _Pfingstl_ with water and his wading up to the middle into\r\nthe brook are, therefore, no doubt rain-charms like those which have\r\nbeen already described.\r\n\r\nBut if these personages represent, as they certainly do, the spirit\r\nof vegetation in spring, the question arises, Why kill them? What is\r\nthe object of slaying the spirit of vegetation at any time and above\r\nall in spring, when his services are most wanted? The only probable\r\nanswer to this question seems to be given in the explanation already\r\nproposed of the custom of killing the divine king or priest. The\r\ndivine life, incarnate in a material and mortal body, is liable to\r\nbe tainted and corrupted by the weakness of the frail medium in\r\nwhich it is for a time enshrined; and if it is to be saved from the\r\nincreasing enfeeblement which it must necessarily share with its\r\nhuman incarnation as he advances in years, it must be detached from\r\nhim before, or at least as soon as, he exhibits signs of decay, in\r\norder to be transferred to a vigorous successor. This is done by\r\nkilling the old representative of the god and conveying the divine\r\nspirit from him to a new incarnation. The killing of the god, that\r\nis, of his human incarnation, is therefore merely a necessary step\r\nto his revival or resurrection in a better form. Far from being an\r\nextinction of the divine spirit, it is only the beginning of a purer\r\nand stronger manifestation of it. If this explanation holds good of\r\nthe custom of killing divine kings and priests in general, it is\r\nstill more obviously applicable to the custom of annually killing\r\nthe representative of the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation in\r\nspring. For the decay of plant life in winter is readily interpreted\r\nby primitive man as an enfeeblement of the spirit of vegetation; the\r\nspirit has, he thinks, grown old and weak and must therefore be\r\nrenovated by being slain and brought to life in a younger and\r\nfresher form. Thus the killing of the representative of the\r\ntree-spirit in spring is regarded as a means to promote and quicken\r\nthe growth of vegetation. For the killing of the tree-spirit is\r\nassociated always (we must suppose) implicitly, and sometimes\r\nexplicitly also, with a revival or resurrection of him in a more\r\nyouthful and vigorous form. So in the Saxon and Th\xfcringen custom,\r\nafter the Wild Man has been shot he is brought to life again by a\r\ndoctor; and in the Wurmlingen ceremony there figures a Dr.\r\nIron-Beard, who probably once played a similar part; certainly in\r\nanother spring ceremony, which will be described presently, Dr.\r\nIron-Beard pretends to restore a dead man to life. But of this\r\nrevival or resurrection of the god we shall have more to say anon.\r\n\r\nThe points of similarity between these North European personages and\r\nthe subject of our enquiry--the King of the Wood or priest of\r\nNemi--are sufficiently striking. In these northern maskers we see\r\nkings, whose dress of bark and leaves along with the hut of green\r\nboughs and the fir-trees, under which they hold their court,\r\nproclaim them unmistakably as, like their Italian counterpart, Kings\r\nof the Wood. Like him they die a violent death, but like him they\r\nmay escape from it for a time by their bodily strength and agility;\r\nfor in several of these northern customs the flight and pursuit of\r\nthe king is a prominent part of the ceremony, and in one case at\r\nleast if the king can outrun his pursuers he retains his life and\r\nhis office for another year. In this last case the king in fact\r\nholds office on condition of running for his life once a year, just\r\nas the King of Calicut in later times held office on condition of\r\ndefending his life against all comers once every twelve years, and\r\njust as the priest of Nemi held office on condition of defending\r\nhimself against any assault at any time. In every one of these\r\ninstances the life of the god-man is prolonged on condition of his\r\nshowing, in a severe physical contest of fight or flight, that his\r\nbodily strength is not decayed, and that, therefore, the violent\r\ndeath, which sooner or later is inevitable, may for the present be\r\npostponed. With regard to flight it is noticeable that flight\r\nfigured conspicuously both in the legend and in the practice of the\r\nKing of the Wood. He had to be a runaway slave in memory of the\r\nflight of Orestes, the traditional founder of the worship; hence the\r\nKings of the Wood are described by an ancient writer as "both strong\r\nof hand and fleet of foot." Perhaps if we knew the ritual of the\r\nArician grove fully we might find that the king was allowed a chance\r\nfor his life by flight, like his Bohemian brother. I have already\r\nconjectured that the annual flight of the priestly king at Rome\r\n(_regifugium_) was at first a flight of the same kind; in other\r\nwords, that he was originally one of those divine kings who are\r\neither put to death after a fixed period or allowed to prove by the\r\nstrong hand or the fleet foot that their divinity is vigorous and\r\nunimpaired. One more point of resemblance may be noted between the\r\nItalian King of the Wood and his northern counterparts. In Saxony\r\nand Th\xfcringen the representative of the tree-spirit, after being\r\nkilled, is brought to life again by a doctor. This is exactly what\r\nlegend affirmed to have happened to the first King of the Wood at\r\nNemi, Hippolytus or Virbius, who after he had been killed by his\r\nhorses was restored to life by the physician Aesculapius. Such a\r\nlegend tallies well with the theory that the slaying of the King of\r\nthe Wood was only a step to his revival or resurrection in his\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Burying the Carnival\r\n\r\nTHUS far I have offered an explanation of the rule which required\r\nthat the priest of Nemi should be slain by his successor. The\r\nexplanation claims to be no more than probable; our scanty knowledge\r\nof the custom and of its history forbids it to be more. But its\r\nprobability will be augmented in proportion to the extent to which\r\nthe motives and modes of thought which it assumes can be proved to\r\nhave operated in primitive society. Hitherto the god with whose\r\ndeath and resurrection we have been chiefly concerned has been the\r\ntree-god. But if I can show that the custom of killing the god and\r\nthe belief in his resurrection originated, or at least existed, in\r\nthe hunting and pastoral stage of society, when the slain god was an\r\nanimal, and that it survived into the agricultural stage, when the\r\nslain god was the corn or a human being representing the corn, the\r\nprobability of my explanation will have been considerably increased.\r\nThis I shall attempt to do in the sequel, and in the course of the\r\ndiscussion I hope to clear up some obscurities which still remain,\r\nand to answer some objections which may have suggested themselves to\r\nthe reader.\r\n\r\nWe start from the point at which we left off--the spring customs of\r\nEuropean peasantry. Besides the ceremonies already described there\r\nare two kindred sets of observances in which the simulated death of\r\na divine or supernatural being is a conspicuous feature. In one of\r\nthem the being whose death is dramatically represented is a\r\npersonification of the Carnival; in the other it is Death himself.\r\nThe former ceremony falls naturally at the end of the Carnival,\r\neither on the last day of that merry season, namely Shrove Tuesday,\r\nor on the first day of Lent, namely Ash Wednesday. The date of the\r\nother ceremony--the Carrying or Driving out of Death, as it is\r\ncommonly called--is not so uniformly fixed. Generally it is the\r\nfourth Sunday in Lent, which hence goes by the name of Dead Sunday;\r\nbut in some places the celebration falls a week earlier, in others,\r\nas among the Czechs of Bohemia, a week later, while in certain\r\nGerman villages of Moravia it is held on the first Sunday after\r\nEaster. Perhaps, as has been suggested, the date may originally have\r\nbeen variable, depending on the appearance of the first swallow or\r\nsome other herald of the spring. Some writers regard the ceremony as\r\nSlavonic in its origin. Grimm thought it was a festival of the New\r\nYear with the old Slavs, who began their year in March. We shall\r\nfirst take examples, of the mimic death of the Carnival, which\r\nalways falls before the other in the calendar.\r\n\r\nAt Frosinone, in Latium, about half-way between Rome and Naples, the\r\ndull monotony of life in a provincial Italian town is agreeably\r\nbroken on the last day of the Carnival by the ancient festival known\r\nas the _Radica._ About four o\'clock in the afternoon the town band,\r\nplaying lively tunes and followed by a great crowd, proceeds to the\r\nPiazza del Plebiscito, where is the Sub-Prefecture as well as the\r\nrest of the Government buildings. Here, in the middle of the square,\r\nthe eyes of the expectant multitude are greeted by the sight of an\r\nimmense car decked with many-coloured festoons and drawn by four\r\nhorses. Mounted on the car is a huge chair, on which sits enthroned\r\nthe majestic figure of the Carnival, a man of stucco about nine feet\r\nhigh with a rubicund and smiling countenance. Enormous boots, a tin\r\nhelmet like those which grace the heads of officers of the Italian\r\nmarine, and a coat of many colours embellished with strange devices,\r\nadorn the outward man of this stately personage. His left hand rests\r\non the arm of the chair, while with his right he gracefully salutes\r\nthe crowd, being moved to this act of civility by a string which is\r\npulled by a man who modestly shrinks from publicity under the\r\nmercy-seat. And now the crowd, surging excitedly round the car,\r\ngives vent to its feelings in wild cries of joy, gentle and simple\r\nbeing mixed up together and all dancing furiously the _Saltarello._\r\nA special feature of the festival is that every one must carry in\r\nhis hand what is called a _radica_ ( "root"), by which is meant a\r\nhuge leaf of the aloe or rather the agave. Any one who ventured into\r\nthe crowd without such a leaf would be unceremoniously hustled out\r\nof it, unless indeed he bore as a substitute a large cabbage at the\r\nend of a long stick or a bunch of grass curiously plaited. When the\r\nmultitude, after a short turn, has escorted the slow-moving car to\r\nthe gate of the Sub-Prefecture, they halt, and the car, jolting over\r\nthe uneven ground, rumbles into the courtyard. A hush now falls on\r\nthe crowd, their subdued voices sounding, according to the\r\ndescription of one who has heard them, like the murmur of a troubled\r\nsea. All eyes are turned anxiously to the door from which the\r\nSub-Prefect himself and the other representatives of the majesty of\r\nthe law are expected to issue and pay their homage to the hero of\r\nthe hour. A few moments of suspense and then a storm of cheers and\r\nhand-clapping salutes the appearance of the dignitaries, as they\r\nfile out and, descending the staircase, take their place in the\r\nprocession. The hymn of the Carnival is now thundered out, after\r\nwhich, amid a deafening roar, aloe leaves and cabbages are whirled\r\naloft and descend impartially on the heads of the just and the\r\nunjust, who lend fresh zest to the proceedings by engaging in a free\r\nfight. When these preliminaries have been concluded to the\r\nsatisfaction of all concerned, the procession gets under weigh. The\r\nrear is brought up by a cart laden with barrels of wine and\r\npolicemen, the latter engaged in the congenial task of serving out\r\nwine to all who ask for it, while a most internecine struggle,\r\naccompanied by a copious discharge of yells, blows, and blasphemy,\r\ngoes on among the surging crowd at the cart\'s tail in their anxiety\r\nnot to miss the glorious opportunity of intoxicating themselves at\r\nthe public expense. Finally, after the procession has paraded the\r\nprincipal streets in this majestic manner, the effigy of Carnival is\r\ntaken to the middle of a public square, stripped of his finery, laid\r\non a pile of wood, and burnt amid the cries of the multitude, who\r\nthundering out once more the song of the Carnival fling their\r\nso-called "roots" on the pyre and give themselves up without\r\nrestraint to the pleasures of the dance.\r\n\r\nIn the Abruzzi a pasteboard figure of the Carnival is carried by\r\nfour grave-diggers with pipes in their mouths and bottles of wine\r\nslung at their shoulder-belts. In front walks the wife of the\r\nCarnival, dressed in mourning and dissolved in tears. From time to\r\ntime the company halts, and while the wife addresses the\r\nsympathising public, the grave-diggers refresh the inner man with a\r\npull at the bottle. In the open square the mimic corpse is laid on a\r\npyre, and to the roll of drums, the shrill screams of the women, and\r\nthe gruffer cries of the men a light is set to it. While the figure\r\nburns, chestnuts are thrown about among the crowd. Sometimes the\r\nCarnival is represented by a straw-man at the top of a pole which is\r\nborne through the town by a troop of mummers in the course of the\r\nafternoon. When evening comes on, four of the mummers hold out a\r\nquilt or sheet by the corners, and the figure of the Carnival is\r\nmade to tumble into it. The procession is then resumed, the\r\nperformers weeping crocodile tears and emphasising the poignancy of\r\ntheir grief by the help of saucepans and dinner bells. Sometimes,\r\nagain, in the Abruzzi the dead Carnival is personified by a living\r\nman who lies in a coffin, attended by another who acts the priest\r\nand dispenses holy water in great profusion from a bathing tub.\r\n\r\nAt Lerida, in Catalonia, the funeral of the Carnival was witnessed\r\nby an English traveller in 1877. On the last Sunday of the Carnival\r\na grand procession of infantry, cavalry, and maskers of many sorts,\r\nsome on horseback and some in carriages, escorted the grand car of\r\nHis Grace Pau Pi, as the effigy was called, in triumph through the\r\nprincipal streets. For three days the revelry ran high, and then at\r\nmidnight on the last day of the Carnival the same procession again\r\nwound through the streets, but under a different aspect and for a\r\ndifferent end. The triumphal car was exchanged for a hearse, in\r\nwhich reposed the effigy of his dead Grace: a troop of maskers, who\r\nin the first procession had played the part of Students of Folly\r\nwith many a merry quip and jest, now, robed as priests and bishops,\r\npaced slowly along holding aloft huge lighted tapers and singing a\r\ndirge. All the mummers wore crape, and all the horsemen carried\r\nblazing flambeaux. Down the high street, between the lofty,\r\nmany-storeyed and balconied houses, where every window, every\r\nbalcony, every housetop was crammed with a dense mass of spectators,\r\nall dressed and masked in fantastic gorgeousness, the procession\r\ntook its melancholy way. Over the scene flashed and played the\r\nshifting cross-lights and shadows from the moving torches: red and\r\nblue Bengal lights flared up and died out again; and above the\r\ntrampling of the horses and the measured tread of the marching\r\nmultitude rose the voices of the priests chanting the requiem, while\r\nthe military bands struck in with the solemn roll of the muffled\r\ndrums. On reaching the principal square the procession halted, a\r\nburlesque funeral oration was pronounced over the defunct Pau Pi,\r\nand the lights were extinguished. Immediately the devil and his\r\nangels darted from the crowd, seized the body and fled away with it,\r\nhotly pursued by the whole multitude, yelling, screaming, and\r\ncheering. Naturally the fiends were overtaken and dispersed; and the\r\nsham corpse, rescued from their clutches, was laid in a grave that\r\nhad been made ready for its reception. Thus the Carnival of 1877 at\r\nLerida died and was buried.\r\n\r\nA ceremony of the same sort is observed in Provence on Ash\r\nWednesday. An effigy called Caramantran, whimsically attired, is\r\ndrawn in a chariot or borne on a litter, accompanied by the populace\r\nin grotesque costumes, who carry gourds full of wine and drain them\r\nwith all the marks, real or affected, of intoxication. At the head\r\nof the procession are some men disguised as judges and barristers,\r\nand a tall gaunt personage who masquerades as Lent; behind them\r\nfollow young people mounted on miserable hacks and attired as\r\nmourners who pretend to bewail the fate that is in store for\r\nCaramantran. In the principal square the procession halts, the\r\ntribunal is constituted, and Caramantran placed at the bar. After a\r\nformal trial he is sentenced to death amid the groans of the mob:\r\nthe barrister who defended him embraces his client for the last\r\ntime: the officers of justice do their duty: the condemned is set\r\nwith his back to a wall and hurried into eternity under a shower of\r\nstones. The sea or a river receives his mangled remains. Throughout\r\nnearly the whole of the Ardennes it was and still is customary on\r\nAsh Wednesday to burn an effigy which is supposed to represent the\r\nCarnival, while appropriate verses are sung round about the blazing\r\nfigure. Very often an attempt is made to fashion the effigy in the\r\nlikeness of the husband who is reputed to be least faithful to his\r\nwife of any in the village. As might perhaps have been anticipated,\r\nthe distinction of being selected for portraiture under these\r\npainful circumstances has a slight tendency to breed domestic jars,\r\nespecially when the portrait is burnt in front of the house of the\r\ngay deceiver whom it represents, while a powerful chorus of\r\ncaterwauls, groans, and other melodious sounds bears public\r\ntestimony to the opinion which his friends and neighbours entertain\r\nof his private virtues. In some villages of the Ardennes a young man\r\nof flesh and blood, dressed up in hay and straw, used to act the\r\npart of Shrove Tuesday (_Mardi Gras_), as the personification of the\r\nCarnival is often called in France after the last day of the period\r\nwhich he personates. He was brought before a mock tribunal, and\r\nbeing condemned to death was placed with his back to a wall, like a\r\nsoldier at a military execution, and fired at with blank cartridges.\r\nAt Vrigne-aux-Bois one of these harmless buffoons, named Thierry,\r\nwas accidentally killed by a wad that had been left in a musket of\r\nthe firing-party. When poor Shrove Tuesday dropped under the fire,\r\nthe applause was loud and long, he did it so naturally; but when he\r\ndid not get up again, they ran to him and found him a corpse. Since\r\nthen there have been no more of these mock executions in the\r\nArdennes.\r\n\r\nIn Normandy on the evening of Ash Wednesday it used to be the custom\r\nto hold a celebration called the Burial of Shrove Tuesday. A squalid\r\neffigy scantily clothed in rags, a battered old hat crushed down on\r\nhis dirty face, his great round paunch stuffed with straw,\r\nrepresented the disreputable old rake who, after a long course of\r\ndissipation, was now about to suffer for his sins. Hoisted on the\r\nshoulders of a sturdy fellow, who pretended to stagger under the\r\nburden, this popular personification of the Carnival promenaded the\r\nstreets for the last time in a manner the reverse of triumphal.\r\nPreceded by a drummer and accompanied by a jeering rabble, among\r\nwhom the urchins and all the tag-rag and bobtail of the town\r\nmustered in great force, the figure was carried about by the\r\nflickering light of torches to the discordant din of shovels and\r\ntongs, pots and pans, horns and kettles, mingled with hootings,\r\ngroans, and hisses. From time to time the procession halted, and a\r\nchampion of morality accused the broken-down old sinner of all the\r\nexcesses he had committed and for which he was now about to be\r\nburned alive. The culprit, having nothing to urge in his own\r\ndefence, was thrown on a heap of straw, a torch was put to it, and a\r\ngreat blaze shot up, to the delight of the children who frisked\r\nround it screaming out some old popular verses about the death of\r\nthe Carnival. Sometimes the effigy was rolled down the slope of a\r\nhill before being burnt. At Saint-L\xf4 the ragged effigy of Shrove\r\nTuesday was followed by his widow, a big burly lout dressed as a\r\nwoman with a crape veil, who emitted sounds of lamentation and woe\r\nin a stentorian voice. After being carried about the streets on a\r\nlitter attended by a crowd of maskers, the figure was thrown into\r\nthe River Vire. The final scene has been graphically described by\r\nMadame Octave Feuillet as she witnessed it in her childhood some\r\nsixty years ago. "My parents invited friends to see, from the top of\r\nthe tower of Jeanne Couillard, the funeral procession passing. It\r\nwas there that, quaffing lemonade--the only refreshment allowed\r\nbecause of the fast--we witnessed at nightfall a spectacle of which\r\nI shall always preserve a lively recollection. At our feet flowed\r\nthe Vire under its old stone bridge. On the middle of the bridge lay\r\nthe figure of Shrove Tuesday on a litter of leaves, surrounded by\r\nscores of maskers dancing, singing, and carrying torches. Some of\r\nthem in their motley costumes ran along the parapet like fiends. The\r\nrest, worn out with their revels, sat on the posts and dozed. Soon\r\nthe dancing stopped, and some of the troop, seizing a torch, set\r\nfire to the effigy, after which they flung it into the river with\r\nredoubled shouts and clamour. The man of straw, soaked with resin,\r\nfloated away burning down the stream of the Vire, lighting up with\r\nits funeral fires the woods on the bank and the battlements of the\r\nold castle in which Louis XI. and Francis I. had slept. When the\r\nlast glimmer of the blazing phantom had vanished, like a falling\r\nstar, at the end of the valley, every one withdrew, crowd and\r\nmaskers alike, and we quitted the ramparts with our guests."\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of T\xfcbingen on Shrove Tuesday a straw-man,\r\ncalled the Shrovetide Bear, is made up; he is dressed in a pair of\r\nold trousers, and a fresh black-pudding or two squirts filled with\r\nblood are inserted in his neck. After a formal condemnation he is\r\nbeheaded, laid in a coffin, and on Ash Wednesday is buried in the\r\nchurchyard. This is called "Burying the Carnival." Amongst some of\r\nthe Saxons of Transylvania the Carnival is hanged. Thus at Braller\r\non Ash Wednesday or Shrove Tuesday two white and two chestnut horses\r\ndraw a sledge on which is placed a straw-man swathed in a white\r\ncloth; beside him is a cart-wheel which is kept turning round. Two\r\nlads disguised as old men follow the sledge lamenting. The rest of\r\nthe village lads, mounted on horseback and decked with ribbons,\r\naccompany the procession, which is headed by two girls crowned with\r\nevergreen and drawn in a waggon or sledge. A trial is held under a\r\ntree, at which lads disguised as soldiers pronounce sentence of\r\ndeath. The two old men try to rescue the straw-man and to fly with\r\nhim, but to no purpose; he is caught by the two girls and handed\r\nover to the executioner, who hangs him on a tree. In vain the old\r\nmen try to climb up the tree and take him down; they always tumble\r\ndown, and at last in despair they throw themselves on the ground and\r\nweep and howl for the hanged man. An official then makes a speech in\r\nwhich he declares that the Carnival was condemned to death because\r\nhe had done them harm, by wearing out their shoes and making them\r\ntired and sleepy. At the "Burial of Carnival" in Lechrain, a man\r\ndressed as a woman in black clothes is carried on a litter or bier\r\nby four men; he is lamented over by men disguised as women in black\r\nclothes, then thrown down before the village dung-heap, drenched\r\nwith water, buried in the dung-heap, and covered with straw. On the\r\nevening of Shrove Tuesday the Esthonians make a straw figure called\r\n_metsik_ or "wood-spirit"; one year it is dressed with a man\'s coat\r\nand hat, next year with a hood and a petticoat. This figure is stuck\r\non a long pole, carried across the boundary of the village with loud\r\ncries of joy, and fastened to the top of a tree in the wood. The\r\nceremony is believed to be a protection against all kinds of\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\nSometimes at these Shrovetide or Lenten ceremonies the resurrection\r\nof the pretended dead person is enacted. Thus, in some parts of\r\nSwabia on Shrove Tuesday Dr. Iron-Beard professes to bleed a sick\r\nman, who thereupon falls as dead to the ground; but the doctor at\r\nlast restores him to life by blowing air into him through a tube. In\r\nthe Harz Mountains, when Carnival is over, a man is laid on a\r\nbaking-trough and carried with dirges to the grave; but in the grave\r\na glass of brandy is buried instead of the man. A speech is\r\ndelivered and then the people return to the village-green or\r\nmeeting-place, where they smoke the long clay pipes which are\r\ndistributed at funerals. On the morning of Shrove Tuesday in the\r\nfollowing year the brandy is dug up and the festival begins by every\r\none tasting the spirit which, as the phrase goes, has come to life\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Carrying out Death\r\n\r\nTHE CEREMONY of "Carrying out Death" presents much the same features\r\nas "Burying the Carnival"; except that the carrying out of Death is\r\ngenerally followed by a ceremony, or at least accompanied by a\r\nprofession, of bringing in Summer, Spring, or Life. Thus in Middle\r\nFranken, a province of Bavaria, on the fourth Sunday in Lent, the\r\nvillage urchins used to make a straw effigy of Death, which they\r\ncarried about with burlesque pomp through the streets, and\r\nafterwards burned with loud cries beyond the bounds. The Frankish\r\ncustom is thus described by a writer of the sixteenth century: "At\r\nMid-Lent, the season when the church bids us rejoice, the young\r\npeople of my native country make a straw image of Death, and\r\nfastening it to a pole carry it with shouts to the neighbouring\r\nvillages. By some they are kindly received, and after being\r\nrefreshed with milk, peas, and dried pears, the usual food of that\r\nseason, are sent home again. Others, however, treat them with\r\nanything but hospitality; for, looking on them as harbingers of\r\nmisfortune, to wit of death, they drive them from their boundaries\r\nwith weapons and insults." In the villages near Erlangen, when the\r\nfourth Sunday in Lent came around, the peasant girls used to dress\r\nthemselves in all their finery with flowers in their hair. Thus\r\nattired they repaired to the neighbouring town, carrying puppets\r\nwhich were adorned with leaves and covered with white cloths. These\r\nthey took from house to house in pairs, stopping at every door where\r\nthey expected to receive something, and singing a few lines in which\r\nthey announced that it was Mid-Lent and that they were about to\r\nthrow Death into the water. When they had collected some trifling\r\ngratuities they went to the river Regnitz and flung the puppets\r\nrepresenting Death into the stream. This was done to ensure a\r\nfruitful and prosperous year; further, it was considered a safeguard\r\nagainst pestilence and sudden death. At Nuremberg girls of seven to\r\neighteen years of age go through the streets bearing a little open\r\ncoffin, in which is a doll hidden under a shroud. Others carry a\r\nbeech branch, with an apple fastened to it for a head, in an open\r\nbox. They sing, "We carry Death into the water, it is well," or "We\r\ncarry Death into the water, carry him in and out again." In some\r\nparts of Bavaria down to 1780 it was believed that a fatal epidemic\r\nwould ensue if the custom of "Carrying out Death" were not observed.\r\n\r\nIn some villages of Th\xfcringen, on the fourth Sunday of Lent, the\r\nchildren used to carry a puppet of birchen twigs through the\r\nvillage, and then threw it into a pool, while they sang, "We carry\r\nthe old Death out behind the herdman\'s old house; we have got\r\nSummer, and Kroden\'s (?) power is destroyed." At Debschwitz or\r\nDobschwitz, near Gera, the ceremony of "Driving out Death" is or was\r\nannually observed on the first of March. The young people make up a\r\nfigure of straw or the like materials, dress it in old clothes,\r\nwhich they have begged from houses in the village, and carry it out\r\nand throw it into the river. On returning to the village they break\r\nthe good news to the people, and receive eggs and other victuals as\r\na reward. The ceremony is or was supposed to purify the village and\r\nto protect the inhabitants from sickness and plague. In other\r\nvillages of Th\xfcringen, in which the population was originally\r\nSlavonic, the carrying out of the puppet is accompanied with the\r\nsinging of a song, which begins, "Now we carry Death out of the\r\nvillage and Spring into the village." At the end of the seventeenth\r\nand beginning of the eighteenth century the custom was observed in\r\nTh\xfcringen as follows. The boys and girls made an effigy of straw or\r\nthe like materials, but the shape of the figure varied from year to\r\nyear. In one year it would represent an old man, in the next an old\r\nwoman, in the third a young man, and in the fourth a maiden, and the\r\ndress of the figure varied with the character it personated. There\r\nused to be a sharp contest as to where the effigy was to be made,\r\nfor the people thought that the house from which it was carried\r\nforth would not be visited with death that year. Having been made,\r\nthe puppet was fastened to a pole and carried by a girl if it\r\nrepresented an old man, but by a boy if it represented an old woman.\r\nThus it was borne in procession, the young people holding sticks in\r\ntheir hands and singing that they were driving out Death. When they\r\ncame to water they threw the effigy into it and ran hastily back,\r\nfearing that it might jump on their shoulders and wring their necks.\r\nThey also took care not to touch it, lest it should dry them up. On\r\ntheir return they beat the cattle with the sticks, believing that\r\nthis would make the animals fat or fruitful. Afterwards they visited\r\nthe house or houses from which they had carried the image of Death;\r\nwhere they received a dole of half-boiled peas. The custom of\r\n"Carrying out Death" was practised also in Saxony. At Leipsic the\r\nbastards and public women used to make a straw effigy of Death every\r\nyear at Mid-Lent. This they carried through all the streets with\r\nsongs and showed it to the young married women. Finally they threw\r\nit into the river Parthe. By this ceremony they professed to make\r\nthe young wives fruitful, to purify the city, and to protect the\r\ninhabitants for that year from plague and other epidemics.\r\n\r\nCeremonies of the same sort are observed at Mid-Lent in Silesia.\r\nThus in many places the grown girls with the help of the young men\r\ndress up a straw figure with women\'s clothes and carry it out of the\r\nvillage towards the setting sun. At the boundary they strip it of\r\nits clothes, tear it in pieces, and scatter the fragments about the\r\nfields. This is called "Burying Death." As they carry the image out,\r\nthey sing that they are about to bury Death under an oak, that he\r\nmay depart from the people. Sometimes the song runs that they are\r\nbearing Death over hill and dale to return no more. In the Polish\r\nneighbourhood of Gross-Strehlitz the puppet is called Goik. It is\r\ncarried on horseback and thrown into the nearest water. The people\r\nthink that the ceremony protects them from sickness of every sort in\r\nthe coming year. In the districts of Wohlau and Guhrau the image of\r\nDeath used to be thrown over the boundary of the next village. But\r\nas the neighbours feared to receive the ill-omened figure, they were\r\non the look-out to repel it, and hard knocks were often exchanged\r\nbetween the two parties. In some Polish parts of Upper Silesia the\r\neffigy, representing an old woman, goes by the name of Marzana, the\r\ngoddess of death. It is made in the house where the last death\r\noccurred, and is carried on a pole to the boundary of the village,\r\nwhere it is thrown into a pond or burnt. At Polkwitz the custom of\r\n"Carrying out Death" fell into abeyance; but an outbreak of fatal\r\nsickness which followed the intermission of the ceremony induced the\r\npeople to resume it.\r\n\r\nIn Bohemia the children go out with a straw-man, representing Death,\r\nto the end of the village, where they burn it, singing--\r\n\r\n\r\n   "Now carry we Death out of the village,\r\n    The new Summer into the village,\r\n    Welcome, dear Summer,\r\n    Green little corn."\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Tabor in Bohemia the figure of Death is carried out of the town\r\nand flung from a high rock into the water, while they sing--\r\n\r\n\r\n   "Death swims on the water,\r\n    Summer will soon be here,\r\n    We carried Death away for you\r\n    We brought the Summer.\r\n    And do thou, O holy Marketa,\r\n    Give us a good year\r\n    For wheat and for rye."\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other parts of Bohemia they carry Death to the end of the\r\nvillage, singing--\r\n\r\n\r\n   "We carry Death out of the village,\r\n    And the New Year into the village.\r\n    Dear Spring, we bid you welcome,\r\n    Green grass, we bid you welcome."\r\n\r\n\r\nBehind the village they erect a pyre, on which they burn the straw\r\nfigure, reviling and scoffing at it the while. Then they return,\r\nsinging--\r\n\r\n\r\n   "We have carried away Death,\r\n    And brought Life back.\r\n    He has taken up his quarters in the village,\r\n    Therefore sing joyous songs."\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some German villages of Moravia, as in Jassnitz and Seitendorf,\r\nthe young folk assemble on the third Sunday in Lent and fashion a\r\nstraw-man, who is generally adorned with a fur cap and a pair of old\r\nleathern hose, if such are to be had. The effigy is then hoisted on\r\na pole and carried by the lads and lasses out into the open fields.\r\nOn the way they sing a song, in which it is said that they are\r\ncarrying Death away and bringing dear Summer into the house, and\r\nwith Summer the May and the flowers. On reaching an appointed place\r\nthey dance in a circle round the effigy with loud shouts and\r\nscreams, then suddenly rush at it and tear it to pieces with their\r\nhands. Lastly, the pieces are thrown together in a heap, the pole is\r\nbroken, and fire is set to the whole. While it burns the troop\r\ndances merrily round it, rejoicing at the victory won by Spring; and\r\nwhen the fire has nearly died out they go to the householders to beg\r\nfor a present of eggs wherewith to hold a feast, taking care to give\r\nas a reason for the request that they have carried Death out and\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe preceding evidence shows that the effigy of Death is often\r\nregarded with fear and treated with marks of hatred and abhorrence.\r\nThus the anxiety of the villagers to transfer the figure from their\r\nown to their neighbours\' land, and the reluctance of the latter to\r\nreceive the ominous guest, are proof enough of the dread which it\r\ninspires. Further, in Lusatia and Silesia the puppet is sometimes\r\nmade to look in at the window of a house, and it is believed that\r\nsome one in the house will die within the year unless his life is\r\nredeemed by the payment of money. Again, after throwing the effigy\r\naway, the bearers sometimes run home lest Death should follow them,\r\nand if one of them falls in running, it is believed that he will die\r\nwithin the year. At Chrudim, in Bohemia, the figure of Death is made\r\nout of a cross, with a head and mask stuck at the top, and a shirt\r\nstretched out on it. On the fifth Sunday in Lent the boys take this\r\neffigy to the nearest brook or pool, and standing in a line throw it\r\ninto the water. Then they all plunge in after it; but as soon as it\r\nis caught no one more may enter the water. The boy who did not enter\r\nthe water or entered it last will die within the year, and he is\r\nobliged to carry the Death back to the village. The effigy is then\r\nburned. On the other hand, it is believed that no one will die\r\nwithin the year in the house out of which the figure of Death has\r\nbeen carried; and the village out of which Death has been driven is\r\nsometimes supposed to be protected against sickness and plague. In\r\nsome villages of Austrian Silesia on the Saturday before Dead Sunday\r\nan effigy is made of old clothes, hay, and straw, for the purpose of\r\ndriving Death out of the village. On Sunday the people, armed with\r\nsticks and straps, assemble before the house where the figure is\r\nlodged. Four lads then draw the effigy by cords through the village\r\namid exultant shouts, while all the others beat it with their sticks\r\nand straps. On reaching a field which belongs to a neighbouring\r\nvillage they lay down the figure, cudgel it soundly, and scatter the\r\nfragments over the field. The people believe that the village from\r\nwhich Death has been thus carried out will be safe from any\r\ninfectious disease for the whole year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Bringing in Summer\r\n\r\nIN THE PRECEDING ceremonies the return of Spring, Summer, or Life,\r\nas a sequel to the expulsion of Death, is only implied or at most\r\nannounced. In the following ceremonies it is plainly enacted. Thus\r\nin some parts of Bohemia the effigy of Death is drowned by being\r\nthrown into the water at sunset; then the girls go out into the wood\r\nand cut down a young tree with a green crown, hang a doll dressed as\r\na woman on it, deck the whole with green, red, and white ribbons,\r\nand march in procession with their _L\xedto_ (Summer) into the village,\r\ncollecting gifts and singing--\r\n\r\n\r\n   "Death swims in the water,\r\n    Spring comes to visit us,\r\n    With eggs that are red,\r\n    With yellow pancakes.\r\n    We carried Death out of the village,\r\n    We are carrying Summer into the village."\r\n\r\n\r\nIn many Silesian villages the figure of Death, after being treated\r\nwith respect, is stript of its clothes and flung with curses into\r\nthe water, or torn to pieces in a field. Then the young folk repair\r\nto a wood, cut down a small fir-tree, peel the trunk, and deck it\r\nwith festoons of evergreens, paper roses, painted egg-shells, motley\r\nbits of cloth, and so forth. The tree thus adorned is called Summer\r\nor May. Boys carry it from house to house singing appropriate songs\r\nand begging for presents. Among their songs is the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "We have carried Death out,\r\n    We are bringing the dear Summer back,\r\n    The Summer and the May\r\n    And all the flowers gay."\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes they also bring back from the wood a prettily adorned\r\nfigure, which goes by the name of Summer, May, or the Bride; in the\r\nPolish districts it is called Dziewanna, the goddess of spring.\r\n\r\nAt Eisenach on the fourth Sunday in Lent young people used to fasten\r\na straw-man, representing Death, to a wheel, which they trundled to\r\nthe top of a hill. Then setting fire to the figure they allowed it\r\nand the wheel to roll down the slope. Next day they cut a tall\r\nfir-tree, tricked it out with ribbons, and set it up in the plain.\r\nThe men then climbed the tree to fetch down the ribbons. In Upper\r\nLusatia the figure of Death, made of straw and rags, is dressed in a\r\nveil furnished by the last bride and a shirt provided by the house\r\nin which the last death took place. Thus arrayed the figure is stuck\r\non the end of a long pole and carried at full speed by the tallest\r\nand strongest girl, while the rest pelt the effigy with sticks and\r\nstones. Whoever hits it will be sure to live through the year. In\r\nthis way Death is carried out of the village and thrown into the\r\nwater or over the boundary of the next village. On their way home\r\neach one breaks a green branch and carries it gaily with him till he\r\nreaches the village, when he throws it away. Sometimes the young\r\npeople of the next village, upon whose land the figure has been\r\nthrown, run after them and hurl it back, not wishing to have Death\r\namong them. Hence the two parties occasionally come to blows.\r\n\r\nIn these cases Death is represented by the puppet which is thrown\r\naway, Summer or Life by the branches or trees which are brought\r\nback. But sometimes a new potency of life seems to be attributed to\r\nthe image of Death itself, and by a kind of resurrection it becomes\r\nthe instrument of the general revival. Thus in some parts of Lusatia\r\nwomen alone are concerned in carrying out Death, and suffer no male\r\nto meddle with it. Attired in mourning, which they wear the whole\r\nday, they make a puppet of straw, clothe it in a white shirt, and\r\ngive it a broom in one hand and a scythe in the other. Singing songs\r\nand pursued by urchins throwing stones, they carry the puppet to the\r\nvillage boundary, where they tear it in pieces. Then they cut down a\r\nfine tree, hang the shirt on it, and carry it home singing. On the\r\nFeast of Ascension the Saxons of Braller, a village of Transylvania,\r\nnot far from Hermannstadt, observe the ceremony of "Carrying out\r\nDeath" in the following manner. After morning service all the\r\nschool-girls repair to the house of one of their number, and there\r\ndress up the Death. This is done by tying a threshed-out sheaf of\r\ncorn into a rough semblance of a head and body, while the arms are\r\nsimulated by a broomstick thrust through it horizontally. The figure\r\nis dressed in the holiday attire of a young peasant woman, with a\r\nred hood, silver brooches, and a profusion of ribbons at the arms\r\nand breast. The girls bustle at their work, for soon the bells will\r\nbe ringing to vespers, and the Death must be ready in time to be\r\nplaced at the open window, that all the people may see it on their\r\nway to church. When vespers are over, the longed-for moment has come\r\nfor the first procession with the Death to begin; it is a privilege\r\nthat belongs to the school-girls alone. Two of the older girls seize\r\nthe figure by the arms and walk in front: all the rest follow two\r\nand two. Boys may take no part in the procession, but they troop\r\nafter it gazing with open-mouthed admiration at the "beautiful\r\nDeath." So the procession goes through all the streets of the\r\nvillage, the girls singing the old hymn that begins--\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Gott mein Vater, deine Liebe\r\n     Reicht so weit der Himmel ist,"\r\n\r\n\r\nto a tune that differs from the ordinary one. When the procession\r\nhas wound its way through every street, the girls go to another\r\nhouse, and having shut the door against the eager prying crowd of\r\nboys who follow at their heels, they strip the Death and pass the\r\nnaked truss of straw out of the window to the boys, who pounce on\r\nit, run out of the village with it without singing, and fling the\r\ndilapidated effigy into the neighbouring brook. This done, the\r\nsecond scene of the little drama begins. While the boys were\r\ncarrying away the Death out of the village, the girls remained in\r\nthe house, and one of them is now dressed in all the finery which\r\nhad been worn by the effigy. Thus arrayed she is led in procession\r\nthrough all the streets to the singing of the same hymn as before.\r\nWhen the procession is over they all betake themselves to the house\r\nof the girl who played the leading part. Here a feast awaits them\r\nfrom which also the boys are excluded. It is a popular belief that\r\nthe children may safely begin to eat gooseberries and other fruit\r\nafter the day on which Death has thus been carried out; for Death,\r\nwhich up to that time lurked especially in gooseberries, is now\r\ndestroyed. Further, they may now bathe with impunity out of doors.\r\nVery similar is the ceremony which, down to recent years, was\r\nobserved in some of the German villages of Moravia. Boys and girls\r\nmet on the afternoon of the first Sunday after Easter, and together\r\nfashioned a puppet of straw to represent Death. Decked with\r\nbright-coloured ribbons and cloths, and fastened to the top of a\r\nlong pole, the effigy was then borne with singing and clamour to the\r\nnearest height, where it was stript of its gay attire and thrown or\r\nrolled down the slope. One of the girls was next dressed in the\r\ngauds taken from the effigy of Death, and with her at its head the\r\nprocession moved back to the village. In some villages the practice\r\nis to bury the effigy in the place that has the most evil reputation\r\nof all the country-side: others throw it into running water.\r\n\r\nIn the Lusatian ceremony described above, the tree which is brought\r\nhome after the destruction of the figure of Death is plainly\r\nequivalent to the trees or branches which, in the preceding customs,\r\nwere brought back as representatives of Summer or Life, after Death\r\nhad been thrown away or destroyed. But the transference of the shirt\r\nworn by the effigy of Death to the tree clearly indicates that the\r\ntree is a kind of revivification, in a new form, of the destroyed\r\neffigy. This comes out also in the Transylvanian and Moravian\r\ncustoms: the dressing of a girl in the clothes worn by the Death,\r\nand the leading her about the village to the same song which had\r\nbeen sung when the Death was being carried about, show that she is\r\nintended to be a kind of resuscitation of the being whose effigy has\r\njust been destroyed. These examples therefore suggest that the Death\r\nwhose demolition is represented in these ceremonies cannot be\r\nregarded as the purely destructive agent which we understand by\r\nDeath. If the tree which is brought back as an embodiment of the\r\nreviving vegetation of spring is clothed in the shirt worn by the\r\nDeath which has just been destroyed, the object certainly cannot be\r\nto check and counteract the revival of vegetation: it can only be to\r\nfoster and promote it. Therefore the being which has just been\r\ndestroyed--the so-called Death--must be supposed to be endowed with\r\na vivifying and quickening influence, which it can communicate to\r\nthe vegetable and even the animal world. This ascription of a\r\nlife-giving virtue to the figure of Death is put beyond a doubt by\r\nthe custom, observed in some places, of taking pieces of the straw\r\neffigy of Death and placing them in the fields to make the crops\r\ngrow, or in the manger to make the cattle thrive. Thus in\r\nSpachendorf, a village of Austrian Silesia, the figure of Death,\r\nmade of straw, brushwood, and rags, is carried with wild songs to an\r\nopen place outside the village and there burned, and while it is\r\nburning a general struggle takes place for the pieces, which are\r\npulled out of the flames with bare hands. Each one who secures a\r\nfragment of the effigy ties it to a branch of the largest tree in\r\nhis garden, or buries it in his field, in the belief that this\r\ncauses the crops to grow better. In the Troppau district of Austrian\r\nSilesia the straw figure which the boys make on the fourth Sunday in\r\nLent is dressed by the girls in woman\'s clothes and hung with\r\nribbons, necklace, and garlands. Attached to a long pole it is\r\ncarried out of the village, followed by a troop of young people of\r\nboth sexes, who alternately frolic, lament, and sing songs. Arrived\r\nat its destination--a field outside the village--the figure is\r\nstripped of its clothes and ornaments; then the crowd rushes at it\r\nand tears it to bits, scuffling for the fragments. Every one tries\r\nto get a wisp of the straw of which the effigy was made, because\r\nsuch a wisp, placed in the manger, is believed to make the cattle\r\nthrive. Or the straw is put in the hens\' nest, it being supposed\r\nthat this prevents the hens from carrying away their eggs, and makes\r\nthem brood much better. The same attribution of a fertilising power\r\nto the figure of Death appears in the belief that if the bearers of\r\nthe figure, after throwing it away, beat cattle with their sticks,\r\nthis will render the beasts fat or prolific. Perhaps the sticks had\r\nbeen previously used to beat the Death, and so had acquired the\r\nfertilising power ascribed to the effigy. We have seen, too, that at\r\nLeipsic a straw effigy of Death was shown to young wives to make\r\nthem fruitful.\r\n\r\nIt seems hardly possible to separate from the May-trees the trees or\r\nbranches which are brought into the village after the destruction of\r\nthe Death. The bearers who bring them in profess to be bringing in\r\nthe Summer, therefore the trees obviously represent the Summer;\r\nindeed in Silesia they are commonly called the Summer or the May,\r\nand the doll which is sometimes attached to the Summer-tree is a\r\nduplicate representative of the Summer, just as the May is sometimes\r\nrepresented at the same time by a May-tree and a May Lady. Further,\r\nthe Summer-trees are adorned like May-trees with ribbons and so on;\r\nlike May-trees, when large, they are planted in the ground and\r\nclimbed up; and like May-trees, when small, they are carried from\r\ndoor to door by boys or girls singing songs and collecting money.\r\nAnd as if to demonstrate the identity of the two sets of customs the\r\nbearers of the Summer-tree sometimes announce that they are bringing\r\nin the Summer and the May. The customs, therefore, of bringing in\r\nthe May and bringing in the Summer are essentially the same; and the\r\nSummer-tree is merely another form of the May-tree, the only\r\ndistinction (besides that of name) being in the time at which they\r\nare respectively brought in; for while the May-tree is usually\r\nfetched in on the first of May or at Whitsuntide, the Summer-tree is\r\nfetched in on the fourth Sunday in Lent. Therefore, if the May-tree\r\nis an embodiment of the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation, the\r\nSummer-tree must likewise be an embodiment of the tree-spirit or\r\nspirit of vegetation. But we have seen that the Summer-tree is in\r\nsome cases a revivification of the effigy of Death. It follows,\r\ntherefore, that in these cases the effigy called Death must be an\r\nembodiment of the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation. This\r\ninference is confirmed, first, by the vivifying and fertilising\r\ninfluence which the fragments of the effigy of Death are believed to\r\nexercise both on vegetable and on animal life; for this influence,\r\nas we saw in an earlier part of this work, is supposed to be a\r\nspecial attribute of the tree-spirit. It is confirmed, secondly, by\r\nobserving that the effigy of Death is sometimes decked with leaves\r\nor made of twigs, branches, hemp, or a threshed-out sheaf of corn;\r\nand that sometimes it is hung on a little tree and so carried about\r\nby girls collecting money, just as is done with the May-tree and the\r\nMay Lady, and with the Summer-tree and the doll attached to it. In\r\nshort we are driven to regard the expulsion of Death and the\r\nbringing in of Summer as, in some cases at least, merely another\r\nform of that death and revival of the spirit of vegetation in spring\r\nwhich we saw enacted in the killing and resurrection of the Wild\r\nMan. The burial and resurrection of the Carnival is probably another\r\nway of expressing the same idea. The interment of the representative\r\nof the Carnival under a dung-heap is natural, if he is supposed to\r\npossess a quickening and fertilising influence like that ascribed to\r\nthe effigy of Death. The Esthonians, indeed, who carry the straw\r\nfigure out of the village in the usual way on Shrove Tuesday, do not\r\ncall it the Carnival, but the Wood-spirit (_Metsik_), and they\r\nclearly indicate the identity of the effigy with the wood-spirit by\r\nfixing it to the top of a tree in the wood, where it remains for a\r\nyear, and is besought almost daily with prayers and offerings to\r\nprotect the herds; for like a true wood-spirit the _Metsik_ is a\r\npatron of cattle. Sometimes the _Metsik_ is made of sheaves of corn.\r\n\r\nThus we may fairly conjecture that the names Carnival, Death, and\r\nSummer are comparatively late and inadequate expressions for the\r\nbeings personified or embodied in the customs with which we have\r\nbeen dealing. The very abstractness of the names bespeaks a modern\r\norigin; for the personification of times and seasons like the\r\nCarnival and Summer, or of an abstract notion like death, is not\r\nprimitive. But the ceremonies themselves bear the stamp of a\r\ndateless antiquity; therefore we can hardly help supposing that in\r\ntheir origin the ideas which they embodied were of a more simple and\r\nconcrete order. The notion of a tree, perhaps of a particular kind\r\nof tree (for some savages have no word for tree in general), or even\r\nof an individual tree, is sufficiently concrete to supply a basis\r\nfrom which by a gradual process of generalisation the wider idea of\r\na spirit of vegetation might be reached. But this general idea of\r\nvegetation would readily be confounded with the season in which it\r\nmanifests itself; hence the substitution of Spring, Summer, or May\r\nfor the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation would be easy and\r\nnatural. Again, the concrete notion of the dying tree or dying\r\nvegetation would by a similar process of generalisation glide into a\r\nnotion of death in general; so that the practice of carrying out the\r\ndying or dead vegetation in spring, as a preliminary to its revival,\r\nwould in time widen out into an attempt to banish Death in general\r\nfrom the village or district. The view that in these spring\r\nceremonies Death meant originally the dying or dead vegetation of\r\nwinter has the high support of W. Mannhardt; and he confirms it by\r\nthe analogy of the name Death as applied to the spirit of the ripe\r\ncorn. Commonly the spirit of the ripe corn is conceived, not as\r\ndead, but as old, and hence it goes by the name of the Old Man or\r\nthe Old Woman. But in some places the last sheaf cut at harvest,\r\nwhich is generally believed to be the seat of the corn spirit, is\r\ncalled "the Dead One": children are warned against entering the\r\ncorn-fields because Death sits in the corn; and, in a game played by\r\nSaxon children in Transylvania at the maize harvest, Death is\r\nrepresented by a child completely covered with maize leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Battle of Summer and Winter\r\n\r\nSOMETIMES in the popular customs of the peasantry the contrast\r\nbetween the dormant powers of vegetation in winter and their\r\nawakening vitality in spring takes the form of a dramatic contest\r\nbetween actors who play the parts respectively of Winter and Summer.\r\nThus in the towns of Sweden on May Day two troops of young men on\r\nhorseback used to meet as if for mortal combat. One of them was led\r\nby a representative of Winter clad in furs, who threw snowballs and\r\nice in order to prolong the cold weather. The other troop was\r\ncommanded by a representative of Summer covered with fresh leaves\r\nand flowers. In the sham fight which followed the party of Summer\r\ncame off victorious, and the ceremony ended with a feast. Again, in\r\nthe region of the middle Rhine, a representative of Summer clad in\r\nivy combats a representative of Winter clad in straw or moss and\r\nfinally gains a victory over him. The vanquished foe is thrown to\r\nthe ground and stripped of his casing of straw, which is torn to\r\npieces and scattered about, while the youthful comrades of the two\r\nchampions sing a song to commemorate the defeat of Winter by Summer.\r\nAfterwards they carry about a summer garland or branch and collect\r\ngifts of eggs and bacon from house to house. Sometimes the champion\r\nwho acts the part of Summer is dressed in leaves and flowers and\r\nwears a chaplet of flowers on his head. In the Palatinate this mimic\r\nconflict takes place on the fourth Sunday in Lent. All over Bavaria\r\nthe same drama used to be acted on the same day, and it was still\r\nkept up in some places down to the middle of the nineteenth century\r\nor later. While Summer appeared clad all in green, decked with\r\nfluttering ribbons, and carrying a branch in blossom or a little\r\ntree hung with apples and pears, Winter was muffled up in cap and\r\nmantle of fur and bore in his hand a snow-shovel or a flail.\r\nAccompanied by their respective retinues dressed in corresponding\r\nattire, they went through all the streets of the village, halting\r\nbefore the houses and singing staves of old songs, for which they\r\nreceived presents of bread, eggs, and fruit. Finally, after a short\r\nstruggle, Winter was beaten by Summer and ducked in the village well\r\nor driven out of the village with shouts and laughter into the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nAt Goepfritz in Lower Austria, two men personating Summer and Winter\r\nused to go from house to house on Shrove Tuesday, and were\r\neverywhere welcomed by the children with great delight. The\r\nrepresentative of Summer was clad in white and bore a sickle; his\r\ncomrade, who played the part of Winter, had a fur-cap on his head,\r\nhis arms and legs were swathed in straw, and he carried a flail. In\r\nevery house they sang verses alternately. At Dr\xf6mling in Brunswick,\r\ndown to the present time, the contest between Summer and Winter is\r\nacted every year at Whitsuntide by a troop of boys and a troop of\r\ngirls. The boys rush singing, shouting, and ringing bells from house\r\nto house to drive Winter away; after them come the girls singing\r\nsoftly and led by a May Bride, all in bright dresses and decked with\r\nflowers and garlands to represent the genial advent of spring.\r\nFormerly the part of Winter was played by a straw-man which the boys\r\ncarried with them; now it is acted by a real man in disguise.\r\n\r\nAmong the Central Esquimaux of North America the contest between\r\nrepresentatives of summer and winter, which in Europe has long\r\ndegenerated into a mere dramatic performance, is still kept up as a\r\nmagical ceremony of which the avowed intention is to influence the\r\nweather. In autumn, when storms announce the approach of the dismal\r\nArctic winter, the Esquimaux divide themselves into two parties\r\ncalled respectively the ptarmigans and the ducks, the ptarmigans\r\ncomprising all persons born in winter, and the ducks all persons\r\nborn in summer. A long rope of sealskin is then stretched out, and\r\neach party laying hold of one end of it seeks by tugging with might\r\nand main to drag the other party over to its side. If the ptarmigans\r\nget the worst of it, then summer has won the game and fine weather\r\nmay be expected to prevail through the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Death and Resurrection of Kostrubonko\r\n\r\nI RUSSIA funeral ceremonies like those of "Burying the Carnival" and\r\n"Carrying out Death" are celebrated under the names, not of Death or\r\nthe Carnival, but of certain mythic figures, Kostrubonko, Kostroma,\r\nKupalo, Lada, and Yarilo. These Russian ceremonies are observed both\r\nin spring and at midsummer. Thus "in Little Russia it used to be the\r\ncustom at Eastertide to celebrate the funeral of a being called\r\nKostrubonko, the deity of the spring. A circle was formed of singers\r\nwho moved slowly around a girl who lay on the ground as if dead, and\r\nas they went they sang:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \'Dead, dead is our Kostrubonko!\r\n     Dead, dead is our dear one!\'\r\n\r\n\r\nuntil the girl suddenly sprang up, on which the chorus joyfully\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \'Come to life, come to life has our Kostrubonko!\r\n     Come to life, come to life has our dear one!\'"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Eve of St. John (Midsummer Eve) a figure of Kupalo is made of\r\nstraw and "is dressed in woman\'s clothes, with a necklace and a\r\nfloral crown. Then a tree is felled, and, after being decked with\r\nribbons, is set up on some chosen spot. Near this tree, to which\r\nthey give the name of Marena [Winter or Death], the straw figure is\r\nplaced, together with a table, on which stand spirits and viands.\r\nAfterwards a bonfire is lit, and the young men and maidens jump over\r\nit in couples, carrying the figure with them. On the next day they\r\nstrip the tree and the figure of their ornaments, and throw them\r\nboth into a stream." On St. Peter\'s Day, the twenty-ninth of June,\r\nor on the following Sunday, "the Funeral of Kostroma" or of Lada or\r\nof Yarilo is celebrated in Russia. In the Governments of Penza and\r\nSimbirsk the funeral used to be represented as follows. A bonfire\r\nwas kindled on the twenty-eighth of June, and on the next day the\r\nmaidens chose one of their number to play the part of Kostroma. Her\r\ncompanions saluted her with deep obeisances, placed her on a board,\r\nand carried her to the bank of a stream. There they bathed her in\r\nthe water, while the oldest girl made a basket of lime-tree bark and\r\nbeat it like a drum. Then they returned to the village and ended the\r\nday with processions, games, and dances. In the Murom district\r\nKostroma was represented by a straw figure dressed in woman\'s\r\nclothes and flowers. This was laid in a trough and carried with\r\nsongs to the bank of a lake or river. Here the crowd divided into\r\ntwo sides, of which the one attacked and the other defended the\r\nfigure. At last the assailants gained the day, stripped the figure\r\nof its dress and ornaments, tore it in pieces, trod the straw of\r\nwhich it was made under foot, and flung it into the stream; while\r\nthe defenders of the figure hid their faces in their hands and\r\npretended to bewail the death of Kostroma. In the district of\r\nKostroma the burial of Yarilo was celebrated on the twenty-ninth or\r\nthirtieth of June. The people chose an old man and gave him a small\r\ncoffin containing a Priapus-like figure representing Yarilo. This he\r\ncarried out of the town, followed by women chanting dirges and\r\nexpressing by their gestures grief and despair. In the open fields a\r\ngrave was dug, and into it the figure was lowered amid weeping and\r\nwailing, after which games and dances were begun, "calling to mind\r\nthe funeral games celebrated in old times by the pagan Slavonians."\r\nIn Little Russia the figure of Yarilo was laid in a coffin and\r\ncarried through the streets after sunset surrounded by drunken\r\nwomen, who kept repeating mournfully, "He is dead! he is dead!" The\r\nmen lifted and shook the figure as if they were trying to recall the\r\ndead man to life. Then they said to the women, "Women, weep not. I\r\nknow what is sweeter than honey." But the women continued to lament\r\nand chant, as they do at funerals. "Of what was he guilty? He was so\r\ngood. He will arise no more. O how shall we part from thee? What is\r\nlife without thee? Arise, if only for a brief hour. But he rises\r\nnot, he not." At last the Yarilo was buried in a grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Death and Revival of Vegetation\r\n\r\nTHESE Russian customs are plainly of the same nature as those which\r\nin Austria and Germany are known as "Carrying out Death." Therefore\r\nif the interpretation here adopted of the latter is right, the\r\nRussian Kostrubonko, Yarilo, and the rest must also have been\r\noriginally embodiments of the spirit of vegetation, and their death\r\nmust have been regarded as a necessary preliminary to their revival.\r\nThe revival as a sequel to the death is enacted in the first of the\r\nceremonies described, the death and resurrection of Kostrubonko. The\r\nreason why in some of these Russian ceremonies the death of the\r\nspirit of vegetation is celebrated at midsummer may be that the\r\ndecline of summer is dated from Midsummer Day, after which the days\r\nbegin to shorten, and the sun sets out on his downward journey:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "To the darksome hollows\r\n    Where the frosts of winter lie."\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch a turning-point of the year, when vegetation might be thought\r\nto share the incipient though still almost imperceptible decay of\r\nsummer, might very well be chosen by primitive man as a fit moment\r\nfor resorting to those magic rites by which he hopes to stay the\r\ndecline, or at least to ensure the revival, of plant life.\r\n\r\nBut while the death of vegetation appears to have been represented\r\nin all, and its revival in some, of these spring and midsummer\r\nceremonies, there are features in some of them which can hardly be\r\nexplained on this hypothesis alone. The solemn funeral, the\r\nlamentations, and the mourning attire, which often characterise\r\nthese rites, are indeed appropriate at the death of the beneficent\r\nspirit of vegetation. But what shall we say of the glee with which\r\nthe effigy is often carried out, of the sticks and stones with which\r\nit is assailed, and the taunts and curses which are hurled at it?\r\nWhat shall we say of the dread of the effigy evinced by the haste\r\nwith which the bearers scamper home as soon as they have thrown it\r\naway, and by the belief that some one must soon die in any house\r\ninto which it has looked? This dread might perhaps be explained by a\r\nbelief that there is a certain infectiousness in the dead spirit of\r\nvegetation which renders its approach dangerous. But this\r\nexplanation, besides being rather strained, does not cover the\r\nrejoicings which often attend the carrying out of Death. We must\r\ntherefore recognise two distinct and seemingly opposite features in\r\nthese ceremonies: on the one hand, sorrow for the death, and\r\naffection and respect for the dead; on the other hand, fear and\r\nhatred of the dead, and rejoicings at his death. How the former of\r\nthese features is to be explained I have attempted to show: how the\r\nlatter came to be so closely associated with the former is a\r\nquestion which I shall try to answer in the sequel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Analogous Rites in India\r\n\r\nIN THE KANAGRA district of India there is a custom observed by young\r\ngirls in spring which closely resembles some of the European spring\r\nceremonies just described. It is called the _Ral\xee Ka mel\xe2,_ or fair\r\nof Ral\xee, the _Ral\xee_ being a small painted earthen image of Siva or\r\nP\xe2rvat\xee. The custom is in vogue all over the Kanagra district, and\r\nits celebration, which is entirely confined to young girls, lasts\r\nthrough most of Chet (March-April) up to the Sankr\xe2nt of Bais\xe2kh\r\n(April). On a morning in March all the young girls of the village\r\ntake small baskets of _d\xfbb_ grass and flowers to an appointed place,\r\nwhere they throw them in a heap. Round this heap they stand in a\r\ncircle and sing. This goes on every day for ten days, till the heap\r\nof grass and flowers has reached a fair height. Then they cut in the\r\njungle two branches, each with three prongs at one end, and place\r\nthem, prongs downwards, over the heap of flowers, so as to make two\r\ntripods or pyramids. On the single uppermost points of these\r\nbranches they get an image-maker to construct two clay images, one\r\nto represent Siva, and the other P\xe2rvat\xee. The girls then divide\r\nthemselves into two parties, one for Siva and one for P\xe2rvat\xee, and\r\nmarry the images in the usual way, leaving out no part of the\r\nceremony. After the marriage they have a feast, the cost of which is\r\ndefrayed by contributions solicited from their parents. Then at the\r\nnext Sankr\xe2nt (Bais\xe2kh) they all go together to the river-side,\r\nthrow the images into a deep pool, and weep over the place, as\r\nthough they were performing funeral obsequies. The boys of the\r\nneighbourhood often tease them by diving after the images, bringing\r\nthem up, and waving them about while the girls are crying over them.\r\nThe object of the fair is said to be to secure a good husband.\r\n\r\nThat in this Indian ceremony the deities Siva and P\xe2rvat\xee are\r\nconceived as spirits of vegetation seems to be proved by the placing\r\nof their images on branches over a heap of grass and flowers. Here,\r\nas often in European folk-custom, the divinities of vegetation are\r\nrepresented in duplicate, by plants and by puppets. The marriage of\r\nthese Indian deities in spring corresponds to the European\r\nceremonies in which the marriage of the vernal spirits of vegetation\r\nis represented by the King and Queen of May, the May Bride,\r\nBridegroom of the May, and so forth. The throwing of the images into\r\nthe water, and the mourning for them, are the equivalents of the\r\nEuropean customs of throwing the dead spirit of vegetation under the\r\nname of Death, Yarilo, Kostroma, and the rest, into the water and\r\nlamenting over it. Again, in India, as often in Europe, the rite is\r\nperformed exclusively by females. The notion that the ceremony helps\r\nto procure husbands for the girls can be explained by the quickening\r\nand fertilising influence which the spirit of vegetation is believed\r\nto exert upon the life of man as well as of plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. The Magic Spring\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL explanation which we have been led to adopt of these and\r\nmany similar ceremonies is that they are, or were in their origin,\r\nmagical rites intended to ensure the revival of nature in spring.\r\nThe means by which they were supposed to effect this end were\r\nimitation and sympathy. Led astray by his ignorance of the true\r\ncauses of things, primitive man believed that in order to produce\r\nthe great phenomena of nature on which his life depended he had only\r\nto imitate them, and that immediately by a secret sympathy or mystic\r\ninfluence the little drama which he acted in forest glade or\r\nmountain dell, on desert plain or wind-swept shore, would be taken\r\nup and repeated by mightier actors on a vaster stage. He fancied\r\nthat by masquerading in leaves and flowers he helped the bare earth\r\nto clothe herself with verdure, and that by playing the death and\r\nburial of winter he drove that gloomy season away, and made smooth\r\nthe path for the footsteps of returning spring. If we find it hard\r\nto throw ourselves even in fancy into a mental condition in which\r\nsuch things seem possible, we can more easily picture to ourselves\r\nthe anxiety which the savage, when he first began to lift his\r\nthoughts above the satisfaction of his merely animal wants, and to\r\nmeditate on the causes of things, may have felt as to the continued\r\noperation of what we now call the laws of nature. To us, familiar as\r\nwe are with the conception of the uniformity and regularity with\r\nwhich the great cosmic phenomena succeed each other, there seems\r\nlittle ground for apprehension that the causes which produce these\r\neffects will cease to operate, at least within the near future. But\r\nthis confidence in the stability of nature is bred only by the\r\nexperience which comes of wide observation and long tradition; and\r\nthe savage, with his narrow sphere of observation and his\r\nshort-lived tradition, lacks the very elements of that experience\r\nwhich alone could set his mind at rest in face of the ever-changing\r\nand often menacing aspects of nature. No wonder, therefore, that he\r\nis thrown into a panic by an eclipse, and thinks that the sun or the\r\nmoon would surely perish, if he did not raise a clamour and shoot\r\nhis puny shafts into the air to defend the luminaries from the\r\nmonster who threatens to devour them. No wonder he is terrified when\r\nin the darkness of night a streak of sky is suddenly illumined by\r\nthe flash of a meteor, or the whole expanse of the celestial arch\r\nglows with the fitful light of the Northern Streamers. Even\r\nphenomena which recur at fixed and uniform intervals may be viewed\r\nby him with apprehension, before he has come to recognise the\r\norderliness of their recurrence. The speed or slowness of his\r\nrecognition of such periodic or cyclic changes in nature will depend\r\nlargely on the length of the particular cycle. The cycle, for\r\nexample, of day and night is everywhere, except in the polar\r\nregions, so short and hence so frequent that men probably soon\r\nceased to discompose themselves seriously as to the chance of its\r\nfailing to recur, though the ancient Egyptians, as we have seen,\r\ndaily wrought enchantments to bring back to the east in the morning\r\nthe fiery orb which had sunk at evening in the crimson west. But it\r\nwas far otherwise with the annual cycle of the seasons. To any man a\r\nyear is a considerable period, seeing that the number of our years\r\nis but few at the best. To the primitive savage, with his short\r\nmemory and imperfect means of marking the flight of time, a year may\r\nwell have been so long that he failed to recognise it as a cycle at\r\nall, and watched the changing aspects of earth and heaven with a\r\nperpetual wonder, alternately delighted and alarmed, elated and cast\r\ndown, according as the vicissitudes of light and heat, of plant and\r\nanimal life, ministered to his comfort or threatened his existence.\r\nIn autumn when the withered leaves were whirled about the forest by\r\nthe nipping blast, and he looked up at the bare boughs, could he\r\nfeel sure that they would ever be green again? As day by day the sun\r\nsank lower and lower in the sky, could he be certain that the\r\nluminary would ever retrace his heavenly road? Even the waning moon,\r\nwhose pale sickle rose thinner and thinner every night over the rim\r\nof the eastern horizon, may have excited in his mind a fear lest,\r\nwhen it had wholly vanished, there should be moons no more.\r\n\r\nThese and a thousand such misgivings may have thronged the fancy and\r\ntroubled the peace of the man who first began to reflect on the\r\nmysteries of the world he lived in, and to take thought for a more\r\ndistant future than the morrow. It was natural, therefore, that with\r\nsuch thoughts and fears he should have done all that in him lay to\r\nbring back the faded blossom to the bough, to swing the low sun of\r\nwinter up to his old place in the summer sky, and to restore its\r\norbed fulness to the silver lamp of the waning moon. We may smile at\r\nhis vain endeavours if we please, but it was only by making a long\r\nseries of experiments, of which some were almost inevitably doomed\r\nto failure, that man learned from experience the futility of some of\r\nhis attempted methods and the fruitfulness of others. After all,\r\nmagical ceremonies are nothing but experiments which have failed and\r\nwhich continue to be repeated merely because, for reasons which have\r\nalready been indicated, the operator is unaware of their failure.\r\nWith the advance of knowledge these ceremonies either cease to be\r\nperformed altogether or are kept up from force of habit long after\r\nthe intention with which they were instituted has been forgotten.\r\nThus fallen from their high estate, no longer regarded as solemn\r\nrites on the punctual performance of which the welfare and even the\r\nlife of the community depend, they sink gradually to the level of\r\nsimple pageants, mummeries, and pastimes, till in the final stage of\r\ndegeneration they are wholly abandoned by older people, and, from\r\nhaving once been the most serious occupation of the sage, become at\r\nlast the idle sport of children. It is in this final stage of decay\r\nthat most of the old magical rites of our European forefathers\r\nlinger on at the present day, and even from this their last retreat\r\nthey are fast being swept away by the rising tide of those\r\nmultitudinous forces, moral, intellectual, and social, which are\r\nbearing mankind onward to a new and unknown goal. We may feel some\r\nnatural regret at the disappearance of quaint customs and\r\npicturesque ceremonies, which have preserved to an age often deemed\r\ndull and prosaic something of the flavour and freshness of the olden\r\ntime, some breath of the springtime of the world; yet our regret\r\nwill be lessened when we remember that these pretty pageants, these\r\nnow innocent diversions, had their origin in ignorance and\r\nsuperstition; that if they are a record of human endeavour, they are\r\nalso a monument of fruitless ingenuity, of wasted labour, and of\r\nblighted hopes; and that for all their gay trappings--their flowers,\r\ntheir ribbons, and their music--they partake far more of tragedy\r\nthan of farce.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation which, following in the footsteps of W.\r\nMannhardt, I have attempted to give of these ceremonies has been not\r\na little confirmed by the discovery, made since this book was first\r\nwritten, that the natives of Central Australia regularly practise\r\nmagical ceremonies for the purpose of awakening the dormant energies\r\nof nature at the approach of what may be called the Australian\r\nspring. Nowhere apparently are the alternations of the seasons more\r\nsudden and the contrasts between them more striking than in the\r\ndeserts of Central Australia, where at the end of a long period of\r\ndrought the sandy and stony wilderness, over which the silence and\r\ndesolation of death appear to brood, is suddenly, after a few days\r\nof torrential rain, transformed into a landscape smiling with\r\nverdure and peopled with teeming multitudes of insects and lizards,\r\nof frogs and birds. The marvellous change which passes over the face\r\nof nature at such times has been compared even by European observers\r\nto the effect of magic; no wonder, then, that the savage should\r\nregard it as such in very deed. Now it is just when there is promise\r\nof the approach of a good season that the natives of Central\r\nAustralia are wont especially to perform those magical ceremonies of\r\nwhich the avowed intention is to multiply the plants and animals\r\nthey use as food. These ceremonies, therefore, present a close\r\nanalogy to the spring customs of our European peasantry not only in\r\nthe time of their celebration, but also in their aim; for we can\r\nhardly doubt that in instituting rites designed to assist the\r\nrevival of plant life in spring our primitive forefathers were\r\nmoved, not by any sentimental wish to smell at early violets, or\r\npluck the rathe primrose, or watch yellow daffodils dancing in the\r\nbreeze, but by the very practical consideration, certainly not\r\nformulated in abstract terms, that the life of man is inextricably\r\nbound up with that of plants, and that if they were to perish he\r\ncould not survive. And as the faith of the Australian savage in the\r\nefficacy of his magic rites is confirmed by observing that their\r\nperformance is invariably followed, sooner or later, by that\r\nincrease of vegetable and animal life which it is their object to\r\nproduce, so, we may suppose, it was with European savages in the\r\nolden time. The sight of the fresh green in brake and thicket, of\r\nvernal flowers blowing on mossy banks, of swallows arriving from the\r\nsouth, and of the sun mounting daily higher in the sky, would be\r\nwelcomed by them as so many visible signs that their enchantments\r\nwere indeed taking effect, and would inspire them with a cheerful\r\nconfidence that all was well with a world which they could thus\r\nmould to suit their wishes. Only in autumn days, as summer slowly\r\nfaded, would their confidence again be dashed by doubts and\r\nmisgivings at symptoms of decay, which told how vain were all their\r\nefforts to stave off for ever the approach of winter and of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX. The Myth of Adonis\r\n\r\nTHE SPECTACLE of the great changes which annually pass over the face\r\nof the earth has powerfully impressed the minds of men in all ages,\r\nand stirred them to meditate on the causes of transformations so\r\nvast and wonderful. Their curiosity has not been purely\r\ndisinterested; for even the savage cannot fail to perceive how\r\nintimately his own life is bound up with the life of nature, and how\r\nthe same processes which freeze the stream and strip the earth of\r\nvegetation menace him with extinction. At a certain stage of\r\ndevelopment men seem to have imagined that the means of averting the\r\nthreatened calamity were in their own hands, and that they could\r\nhasten or retard the flight of the seasons by magic art. Accordingly\r\nthey performed ceremonies and recited spells to make the rain to\r\nfall, the sun to shine, animals to multiply, and the fruits of the\r\nearth to grow. In course of time the slow advance of knowledge,\r\nwhich has dispelled so many cherished illusions, convinced at least\r\nthe more thoughtful portion of mankind that the alternations of\r\nsummer and winter, of spring and autumn, were not merely the result\r\nof their own magical rites, but that some deeper cause, some\r\nmightier power, was at work behind the shifting scenes of nature.\r\nThey now pictured to themselves the growth and decay of vegetation,\r\nthe birth and death of living creatures, as effects of the waxing or\r\nwaning strength of divine beings, of gods and goddesses, who were\r\nborn and died, who married and begot children, on the pattern of\r\nhuman life.\r\n\r\nThus the old magical theory of the seasons was displaced, or rather\r\nsupplemented, by a religious theory. For although men now attributed\r\nthe annual cycle of change primarily to corresponding changes in\r\ntheir deities, they still thought that by performing certain magical\r\nrites they could aid the god who was the principle of life, in his\r\nstruggle with the opposing principle of death. They imagined that\r\nthey could recruit his failing energies and even raise him from the\r\ndead. The ceremonies which they observed for this purpose were in\r\nsubstance a dramatic representation of the natural processes which\r\nthey wished to facilitate; for it is a familiar tenet of magic that\r\nyou can produce any desired effect by merely imitating it. And as\r\nthey now explained the fluctuations of growth and decay, of\r\nreproduction and dissolution, by the marriage, the death, and the\r\nrebirth or revival of the gods, their religious or rather magical\r\ndramas turned in great measure on these themes. They set forth the\r\nfruitful union of the powers of fertility, the sad death of one at\r\nleast of the divine partners, and his joyful resurrection. Thus a\r\nreligious theory was blended with a magical practice. The\r\ncombination is familiar in history. Indeed, few religions have ever\r\nsucceeded in wholly extricating themselves from the old trammels of\r\nmagic. The inconsistency of acting on two opposite principles,\r\nhowever it may vex the soul of the philosopher, rarely troubles the\r\ncommon man; indeed he is seldom even aware of it. His affair is to\r\nact, not to analyse the motives of his action. If mankind had always\r\nbeen logical and wise, history would not be a long chronicle of\r\nfolly and crime.\r\n\r\nOf the changes which the seasons bring with them, the most striking\r\nwithin the temperate zone are those which affect vegetation. The\r\ninfluence of the seasons on animals, though great, is not nearly so\r\nmanifest. Hence it is natural that in the magical dramas designed to\r\ndispel winter and bring back spring the emphasis should be laid on\r\nvegetation, and that trees and plants should figure in them more\r\nprominently than beasts and birds. Yet the two sides of life, the\r\nvegetable and the animal, were not dissociated in the minds of those\r\nwho observed the ceremonies. Indeed they commonly believed that the\r\ntie between the animal and the vegetable world was even closer than\r\nit really is; hence they often combined the dramatic representation\r\nof reviving plants with a real or a dramatic union of the sexes for\r\nthe purpose of furthering at the same time and by the same act the\r\nmultiplication of fruits, of animals, and of men. To them the\r\nprinciple of life and fertility, whether animal or vegetable, was\r\none and indivisible. To live and to cause to live, to eat food and\r\nto beget children, these were the primary wants of men in the past,\r\nand they will be the primary wants of men in the future so long as\r\nthe world lasts. Other things may be added to enrich and beautify\r\nhuman life, but unless these wants are first satisfied, humanity\r\nitself must cease to exist. These two things, therefore, food and\r\nchildren, were what men chiefly sought to procure by the performance\r\nof magical rites for the regulation of the seasons.\r\n\r\nNowhere, apparently, have these rites been more widely and solemnly\r\ncelebrated than in the lands which border the Eastern Mediterranean.\r\nUnder the names of Osiris, Tammuz, Adonis, and Attis, the peoples of\r\nEgypt and Western Asia represented the yearly decay and revival of\r\nlife, especially of vegetable life, which they personified as a god\r\nwho annually died and rose again from the dead. In name and detail\r\nthe rites varied from place to place: in substance they were the\r\nsame. The supposed death and resurrection of this oriental deity, a\r\ngod of many names but of essentially one nature, is now to be\r\nexamined. We begin with Tammuz or Adonis.\r\n\r\nThe worship of Adonis was practised by the Semitic peoples of\r\nBabylonia and Syria, and the Greeks borrowed it from them as early\r\nas the seventh century before Christ. The true name of the deity was\r\nTammuz: the appellation of Adonis is merely the Semitic _Adon,_\r\n"lord," a title of honour by which his worshippers addressed him.\r\nBut the Greeks through a misunderstanding converted the title of\r\nhonour into a proper name. In the religious literature of Babylonia\r\nTammuz appears as the youthful spouse or lover of Ishtar, the great\r\nmother goddess, the embodiment of the reproductive energies of\r\nnature. The references to their connexion with each other in myth\r\nand ritual are both fragmentary and obscure, but we gather from them\r\nthat every year Tammuz was believed to die, passing away from the\r\ncheerful earth to the gloomy subterranean world, and that every year\r\nhis divine mistress journeyed in quest of him "to the land from\r\nwhich there is no returning, to the house of darkness, where dust\r\nlies on door and bolt." During her absence the passion of love\r\nceased to operate: men and beasts alike forgot to reproduce their\r\nkinds: all life was threatened with extinction. So intimately bound\r\nup with the goddess were the sexual functions of the whole animal\r\nkingdom that without her presence they could not be discharged. A\r\nmessenger of the great god Ea was accordingly despatched to rescue\r\nthe goddess on whom so much depended. The stern queen of the\r\ninfernal regions, Allatu or Eresh-Kigal by name, reluctantly allowed\r\nIshtar to be sprinkled with the Water of Life and to depart, in\r\ncompany probably with her lover Tammuz, that the two might return\r\ntogether to the upper world, and that with their return all nature\r\nmight revive.\r\n\r\nLaments for the departed Tammuz are contained in several Babylonian\r\nhymns, which liken him to plants that quickly fade. He is\r\n\r\n\r\n   "A tamarisk that in the garden has drunk no water,\r\n    Whose crown in the field has brought forth no blossom.\r\n    A willow that rejoiced not by the watercourse,\r\n    A willow whose roots were torn up.\r\n    A herb that in the garden had drunk no water."\r\n\r\n\r\nHis death appears to have been annually mourned, to the shrill music\r\nof flutes, by men and women about midsummer in the month named after\r\nhim, the month of Tammuz. The dirges were seemingly chanted over an\r\neffigy of the dead god, which was washed with pure water, anointed\r\nwith oil, and clad in a red robe, while the fumes of incense rose\r\ninto the air, as if to stir his dormant senses by their pungent\r\nfragrance and wake him from the sleep of death. In one of these\r\ndirges, inscribed _Lament of the Flutes for Tammuz,_ we seem still\r\nto hear the voices of the singers chanting the sad refrain and to\r\ncatch, like far-away music, the wailing notes of the flutes:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "At his vanishing away she lifts up a lament,\r\n    \'Oh my child!\' at his vanishing away she lifts up a lament;\r\n    \'My Damu!\' at his vanishing away she lifts up a lament.\r\n    \'My enchanter and priest!\' at his vanishing away\r\n            she lifts up a lament,\r\n    At the shining cedar, rooted in a spacious place,\r\n    In Eanna, above and below, she lifts up a lament.\r\n    Like the lament that a house lifts up for its master,\r\n            lifts she up a lament,\r\n    Like the lament that a city lifts up for its lord,\r\n            lifts she up a lament.\r\n    Her lament is the lament for a herb that grows not in the bed,\r\n    Her lament is the lament for the corn that grows not in the ear.\r\n    Her chamber is a possession that brings not forth a possession,\r\n    A weary woman, a weary child, forspent.\r\n    Her lament is for a great river, where no willows grow,\r\n    Her lament is for a field, where corn and herbs grow not.\r\n    Her lament is for a pool, where fishes grow not.\r\n    Her lament is for a thickest of reeds, where no reeds grow.\r\n    Her lament is for woods, where tamarisks grow not.\r\n    Her lament is for a wilderness where no cypresses (?) grow.\r\n    Her lament is for the depth of a garden of trees,\r\n            where honey and wine grow not.\r\n    Her lament is for meadows, where no plants grow.\r\n    Her lament is for a palace, where length of life grows not."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tragical story and the melancholy rites of Adonis are better\r\nknown to us from the descriptions of Greek writers than from the\r\nfragments of Babylonian literature or the brief reference of the\r\nprophet Ezekiel, who saw the women of Jerusalem weeping for Tammuz\r\nat the north gate of the temple. Mirrored in the glass of Greek\r\nmythology, the oriental deity appears as a comely youth beloved by\r\nAphrodite. In his infancy the goddess hid him in a chest, which she\r\ngave in charge to Persephone, queen of the nether world. But when\r\nPersephone opened the chest and beheld the beauty of the babe, she\r\nrefused to give him back to Aphrodite, though the goddess of love\r\nwent down herself to hell to ransom her dear one from the power of\r\nthe grave. The dispute between the two goddesses of love and death\r\nwas settled by Zeus, who decreed that Adonis should abide with\r\nPersephone in the under world for one part of the year, and with\r\nAphrodite in the upper world for another part. At last the fair\r\nyouth was killed in hunting by a wild boar, or by the jealous Ares,\r\nwho turned himself into the likeness of a boar in order to compass\r\nthe death of his rival. Bitterly did Aphrodite lament her loved and\r\nlost Adonis. In this form of the myth, the contest between Aphrodite\r\nand Persephone for the possession of Adonis clearly reflects the\r\nstruggle between Ishtar and Allatu in the land of the dead, while\r\nthe decision of Zeus that Adonis is to spend one part of the year\r\nunder ground and another part above ground is merely a Greek version\r\nof the annual disappearance and reappearance of Tammuz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX. Adonis in Syria\r\n\r\nTHE MYTH of Adonis was localised and his rites celebrated with much\r\nsolemnity at two places in Western Asia. One of these was Byblus on\r\nthe coast of Syria, the other was Paphos in Cyprus. Both were great\r\nseats of the worship of Aphrodite, or rather of her Semitic\r\ncounterpart, Astarte; and of both, if we accept the legends,\r\nCinyras, the father of Adonis, was king. Of the two cities Byblus\r\nwas the more ancient; indeed it claimed to be the oldest city in\r\nPhoenicia, and to have been founded in the early ages of the world\r\nby the great god El, whom Greeks and Romans identified with Cronus\r\nand Saturn respectively. However that may have been, in historical\r\ntimes it ranked as a holy place, the religious capital of the\r\ncountry, the Mecca or Jerusalem of the Phoenicians. The city stood\r\non a height beside the sea, and contained a great sanctuary of\r\nAstarte, where in the midst of a spacious open court, surrounded by\r\ncloisters and approached from below by staircases, rose a tall cone\r\nor obelisk, the holy image of the goddess. In this sanctuary the\r\nrites of Adonis were celebrated. Indeed the whole city was sacred to\r\nhim, and the river Nahr Ibrahim, which falls into the sea a little\r\nto the south of Byblus, bore in antiquity the name of Adonis. This\r\nwas the kingdom of Cinyras. From the earliest to the latest times\r\nthe city appears to have been ruled by kings, assisted perhaps by a\r\nsenate or council of elders.\r\n\r\nThe last king of Byblus bore the ancient name of Cinyras, and was\r\nbeheaded by Pompey the Great for his tyrannous excesses. His\r\nlegendary namesake Cinyras is said to have founded a sanctuary of\r\nAphrodite, that is, of Astarte, at a place on Mount Lebanon, distant\r\na day\'s journey from the capital. The spot was probably Aphaca, at\r\nthe source of the river Adonis, half-way between Byblus and Baalbec;\r\nfor at Aphaca there was a famous grove and sanctuary of Astarte\r\nwhich Constantine destroyed on account of the flagitious character\r\nof the worship. The site of the temple has been discovered by modern\r\ntravellers near the miserable village which still bears the name of\r\nAfka at the head of the wild, romantic, wooded gorge of the Adonis.\r\nThe hamlet stands among groves of noble walnut-trees on the brink of\r\nthe lyn. A little way off the river rushes from a cavern at the foot\r\nof a mighty amphitheatre of towering cliffs to plunge in a series of\r\ncascades into the awful depths of the glen. The deeper it descends,\r\nthe ranker and denser grows the vegetation, which, sprouting from\r\nthe crannies and fissures of the rocks, spreads a green veil over\r\nthe roaring or murmuring stream in the tremendous chasm below. There\r\nis something delicious, almost intoxicating, in the freshness of\r\nthese tumbling waters, in the sweetness and purity of the mountain\r\nair, in the vivid green of the vegetation. The temple, of which some\r\nmassive hewn blocks and a fine column of Syenite granite still mark\r\nthe site, occupied a terrace facing the source of the river and\r\ncommanding a magnificent prospect. Across the foam and the roar of\r\nthe waterfalls you look up to the cavern and away to the top of the\r\nsublime precipices above. So lofty is the cliff that the goats which\r\ncreep along its ledges to browse on the bushes appear like ants to\r\nthe spectator hundreds of feet below. Seaward the view is especially\r\nimpressive when the sun floods the profound gorge with golden light,\r\nrevealing all the fantastic buttresses and rounded towers of its\r\nmountain rampart, and falling softly on the varied green of the\r\nwoods which clothe its depths. It was here that, according to the\r\nlegend, Adonis met Aphrodite for the first or the last time, and\r\nhere his mangled body was buried. A fairer scene could hardly be\r\nimagined for a story of tragic love and death. Yet, sequestered as\r\nthe valley is and must always have been, it is not wholly deserted.\r\nA convent or a village may be observed here and there standing out\r\nagainst the sky on the top of some beetling crag, or clinging to the\r\nface of a nearly perpendicular cliff high above the foam and the din\r\nof the river; and at evening the lights that twinkle through the\r\ngloom betray the presence of human habitations on slopes which might\r\nseem inaccessible to man. In antiquity the whole of the lovely vale\r\nappears to have been dedicated to Adonis, and to this day it is\r\nhaunted by his memory; for the heights which shut it in are crested\r\nat various points by ruined monuments of his worship, some of them\r\noverhanging dreadful abysses, down which it turns the head dizzy to\r\nlook and see the eagles wheeling about their nests far below. One\r\nsuch monument exists at Ghineh. The face of a great rock, above a\r\nroughly hewn recess, is here carved with figures of Adonis and\r\nAphrodite. He is portrayed with spear in rest, awaiting the attack\r\nof a bear, while she is seated in an attitude of sorrow. Her\r\ngrief-stricken figure may well be the mourning Aphrodite of the\r\nLebanon described by Macrobius, and the recess in the rock is\r\nperhaps her lover\'s tomb. Every year, in the belief of his\r\nworshippers, Adonis was wounded to death on the mountains, and every\r\nyear the face of nature itself was dyed with his sacred blood. So\r\nyear by year the Syrian damsels lamented his untimely fate, while\r\nthe red anemone, his flower, bloomed among the cedars of Lebanon,\r\nand the river ran red to the sea, fringing the winding shores of the\r\nblue Mediterranean, whenever the wind set inshore, with a sinuous\r\nband of crimson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI. Adonis in Cyprus\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND of Cyprus lies but one day\'s sail from the coast of\r\nSyria. Indeed, on fine summer evenings its mountains may be descried\r\nlooming low and dark against the red fires of sunset. With its rich\r\nmines of copper and its forests of firs and stately cedars, the\r\nisland naturally attracted a commercial and maritime people like the\r\nPhoenicians; while the abundance of its corn, its wine, and its oil\r\nmust have rendered it in their eyes a Land of Promise by comparison\r\nwith the niggardly nature of their own rugged coast, hemmed in\r\nbetween the mountains and the sea. Accordingly they settled in\r\nCyprus at a very early date and remained there long after the Greeks\r\nhad also established themselves on its shores; for we know from\r\ninscriptions and coins that Phoenician kings reigned at Citium, the\r\nChittim of the Hebrews, down to the time of Alexander the Great.\r\nNaturally the Semitic colonists brought their gods with them from\r\nthe mother-land. They worshipped Baal of the Lebanon, who may well\r\nhave been Adonis, and at Amathus on the south coast they instituted\r\nthe rites of Adonis and Aphrodite, or rather Astarte. Here, as at\r\nByblus, these rites resembled the Egyptian worship of Osiris so\r\nclosely that some people even identified the Adonis of Amathus with\r\nOsiris.\r\n\r\nBut the great seat of the worship of Aphrodite and Adonis in Cyprus\r\nwas Paphos on the south-western side of the island. Among the petty\r\nkingdoms into which Cyprus was divided from the earliest times until\r\nthe end of the fourth century before our era Paphos must have ranked\r\nwith the best. It is a land of hills and billowy ridges, diversified\r\nby fields and vineyards and intersected by rivers, which in the\r\ncourse of ages have carved for themselves beds of such tremendous\r\ndepth that travelling in the interior is difficult and tedious. The\r\nlofty range of Mount Olympus (the modern Troodos), capped with snow\r\nthe greater part of the year, screens Paphos from the northerly and\r\neasterly winds and cuts it off from the rest of the island. On the\r\nslopes of the range the last pine-woods of Cyprus linger, sheltering\r\nhere and there monasteries in scenery not unworthy of the Apennines.\r\nThe old city of Paphos occupied the summit of a hill about a mile\r\nfrom the sea; the newer city sprang up at the harbour some ten miles\r\noff. The sanctuary of Aphrodite at Old Paphos (the modern Kuklia)\r\nwas one of the most celebrated shrines in the ancient world.\r\nAccording to Herodotus, it was founded by Phoenician colonists from\r\nAscalon; but it is possible that a native goddess of fertility was\r\nworshipped on the spot before the arrival of the Phoenicians, and\r\nthat the newcomers identified her with their own Baalath or Astarte,\r\nwhom she may have closely resembled. If two deities were thus fused\r\nin one, we may suppose that they were both varieties of that great\r\ngoddess of motherhood and fertility whose worship appears to have\r\nbeen spread all over Western Asia from a very early time. The\r\nsupposition is confirmed as well by the archaic shape of her image\r\nas by the licentious character of her rites; for both that shape and\r\nthose rites were shared by her with other Asiatic deities. Her image\r\nwas simply a white cone or pyramid. In like manner, a cone was the\r\nemblem of Astarte at Byblus, of the native goddess whom the Greeks\r\ncalled Artemis at Perga in Pamphylia, and of the sun-god\r\nHeliogabalus at Emesa in Syria. Conical stones, which apparently\r\nserved as idols, have also been found at Golgi in Cyprus, and in the\r\nPhoenician temples of Malta; and cones of sandstone came to light at\r\nthe shrine of the "Mistress of Torquoise" among the barren hills and\r\nfrowning precipices of Sinai.\r\n\r\nIn Cyprus it appears that before marriage all women were formerly\r\nobliged by custom to prostitute themselves to strangers at the\r\nsanctuary of the goddess, whether she went by the name of Aphrodite,\r\nAstarte, or what not. Similar customs prevailed in many parts of\r\nWestern Asia. Whatever its motive, the practice was clearly\r\nregarded, not as an orgy of lust, but as a solemn religious duty\r\nperformed in the service of that great Mother Goddess of Western\r\nAsia whose name varied, while her type remained constant, from place\r\nto place. Thus at Babylon every woman, whether rich or poor, had\r\nonce in her life to submit to the embraces of a stranger at the\r\ntemple of Mylitta, that is, of Ishtar or Astarte, and to dedicate to\r\nthe goddess the wages earned by this sanctified harlotry. The sacred\r\nprecinct was crowded with women waiting to observe the custom. Some\r\nof them had to wait there for years. At Heliopolis or Baalbec in\r\nSyria, famous for the imposing grandeur of its ruined temples, the\r\ncustom of the country required that every maiden should prostitute\r\nherself to a stranger at the temple of Astarte, and matrons as well\r\nas maids testified their devotion to the goddess in the same manner.\r\nThe emperor Constantine abolished the custom, destroyed the temple,\r\nand built a church in its stead. In Phoenician temples women\r\nprostituted themselves for hire in the service of religion,\r\nbelieving that by this conduct they propitiated the goddess and won\r\nher favour. "It was a law of the Amorites, that she who was about to\r\nmarry should sit in fornication seven days by the gate." At Byblus\r\nthe people shaved their heads in the annual mourning for Adonis.\r\nWomen who refused to sacrifice their hair had to give themselves up\r\nto strangers on a certain day of the festival, and the money which\r\nthey thus earned was devoted to the goddess. A Greek inscription\r\nfound at Tralles in Lydia proves that the practice of religious\r\nprostitution survived in that country as late as the second century\r\nof our era. It records of a certain woman, Aurelia Aemilia by name,\r\nnot only that she herself served the god in the capacity of a harlot\r\nat his express command, but that her mother and other female\r\nancestors had done the same before her; and the publicity of the\r\nrecord, engraved on a marble column which supported a votive\r\noffering, shows that no stain attached to such a life and such a\r\nparentage. In Armenia the noblest families dedicated their daughters\r\nto the service of the goddess Anaitis in her temple of Acilisena,\r\nwhere the damsels acted as prostitutes for a long time before they\r\nwere given in marriage. Nobody scrupled to take one of these girls\r\nto wife when her period of service was over. Again, the goddess Ma\r\nwas served by a multitude of sacred harlots at Comana in Pontus, and\r\ncrowds of men and women flocked to her sanctuary from the\r\nneighbouring cities and country to attend the biennial festivals or\r\nto pay their vows to the goddess.\r\n\r\nIf we survey the whole of the evidence on this subject, some of\r\nwhich has still to be laid before the reader, we may conclude that a\r\ngreat Mother Goddess, the personification of all the reproductive\r\nenergies of nature, was worshipped under different names but with a\r\nsubstantial similarity of myth and ritual by many peoples of Western\r\nAsia; that associated with her was a lover, or rather series of\r\nlovers, divine yet mortal, with whom she mated year by year, their\r\ncommerce being deemed essential to the propagation of animals and\r\nplants, each in their several kind; and further, that the fabulous\r\nunion of the divine pair was simulated and, as it were, multiplied\r\non earth by the real, though temporary, union of the human sexes at\r\nthe sanctuary of the goddess for the sake of thereby ensuring the\r\nfruitfulness of the ground and the increase of man and beast.\r\n\r\nAt Paphos the custom of religious prostitution is said to have been\r\ninstituted by King Cinyras, and to have been practised by his\r\ndaughters, the sisters of Adonis, who, having incurred the wrath of\r\nAphrodite, mated with strangers and ended their days in Egypt. In\r\nthis form of the tradition the wrath of Aphrodite is probably a\r\nfeature added by a later authority, who could only regard conduct\r\nwhich shocked his own moral sense as a punishment inflicted by the\r\ngoddess instead of as a sacrifice regularly enjoined by her on all\r\nher devotees. At all events the story indicates that the princesses\r\nof Paphos had to conform to the custom as well as women of humble\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\nAmong the stories which were told of Cinyras, the ancestor of the\r\npriestly kings of Paphos and the father of Adonis, there are some\r\nthat deserve our attention. In the first place, he is said to have\r\nbegotten his son Adonis in incestuous intercourse with his daughter\r\nMyrrha at a festival of the corn-goddess, at which women robed in\r\nwhite were wont to offer corn-wreaths as first-fruits of the harvest\r\nand to observe strict chastity for nine days. Similar cases of\r\nincest with a daughter are reported of many ancient kings. It seems\r\nunlikely that such reports are without foundation, and perhaps\r\nequally improbable that they refer to mere fortuitous outbursts of\r\nunnatural lust. We may suspect that they are based on a practice\r\nactually observed for a definite reason in certain special\r\ncircumstances. Now in countries where the royal blood was traced\r\nthrough women only, and where consequently the king held office\r\nmerely in virtue of his marriage with an hereditary princess, who\r\nwas the real sovereign, it appears to have often happened that a\r\nprince married his own sister, the princess royal, in order to\r\nobtain with her hand the crown which otherwise would have gone to\r\nanother man, perhaps to a stranger. May not the same rule of descent\r\nhave furnished a motive for incest with a daughter? For it seems a\r\nnatural corollary from such a rule that the king was bound to vacate\r\nthe throne on the death of his wife, the queen, since he occupied it\r\nonly by virtue of his marriage with her. When that marriage\r\nterminated, his right to the throne terminated with it and passed at\r\nonce to his daughter\'s husband. Hence if the king desired to reign\r\nafter his wife\'s death, the only way in which he could legitimately\r\ncontinue to do so was by marrying his daughter, and thus prolonging\r\nthrough her the title which had formerly been his through her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nCinyras is said to have been famed for his exquisite beauty and to\r\nhave been wooed by Aphrodite herself. Thus it would appear, as\r\nscholars have already observed, that Cinyras was in a sense a\r\nduplicate of his handsome son Adonis, to whom the inflammable\r\ngoddess also lost her heart. Further, these stories of the love of\r\nAphrodite for two members of the royal house of Paphos can hardly be\r\ndissociated from the corresponding legend told of Pygmalion, a\r\nPhoenician king of Cyprus, who is said to have fallen in love with\r\nan image of Aphrodite and taken it to his bed. When we consider that\r\nPygmalion was the father-in-law of Cinyras, that the son of Cinyras\r\nwas Adonis, and that all three, in successive generations, are said\r\nto have been concerned in a love-intrigue with Aphrodite, we can\r\nhardly help concluding that the early Phoenician kings of Paphos, or\r\ntheir sons, regularly claimed to be not merely the priests of the\r\ngoddess but also her lovers, in other words, that in their official\r\ncapacity they personated Adonis. At all events Adonis is said to\r\nhave reigned in Cyprus, and it appears to be certain that the title\r\nof Adonis was regularly borne by the sons of all the Phoenician\r\nkings of the island. It is true that the title strictly signified no\r\nmore than "lord"; yet the legends which connect these Cyprian\r\nprinces with the goddess of love make it probable that they claimed\r\nthe divine nature as well as the human dignity of Adonis. The story\r\nof Pygmalion points to a ceremony of a sacred marriage in which the\r\nking wedded the image of Aphrodite, or rather of Astarte. If that\r\nwas so, the tale was in a sense true, not of a single man only, but\r\nof a whole series of men, and it would be all the more likely to be\r\ntold of Pygmalion, if that was a common name of Semitic kings in\r\ngeneral, and of Cyprian kings in particular. Pygmalion, at all\r\nevents, is known as the name of the king of Tyre from whom his\r\nsister Dido fled; and a king of Citium and Idalium in Cyprus, who\r\nreigned in the time of Alexander the Great, was also called\r\nPygmalion, or rather Pumiyathon, the Phoenician name which the\r\nGreeks corrupted into Pygmalion. Further, it deserves to be noted\r\nthat the names Pygmalion and Astarte occur together in a Punic\r\ninscription on a gold medallion which was found in a grave at\r\nCarthage; the characters of the inscription are of the earliest\r\ntype. As the custom of religious prostitution at Paphos is said to\r\nhave been founded by king Cinyras and observed by his daughters, we\r\nmay surmise that the kings of Paphos played the part of the divine\r\nbridegroom in a less innocent rite than the form of marriage with a\r\nstatue; in fact, that at certain festivals each of them had to mate\r\nwith one or more of the sacred harlots of the temple, who played\r\nAstarte to his Adonis. If that was so, there is more truth than has\r\ncommonly been supposed in the reproach cast by the Christian fathers\r\nthat the Aphrodite worshipped by Cinyras was a common whore. The\r\nfruit of their union would rank as sons and daughters of the deity,\r\nand would in time become the parents of gods and goddesses, like\r\ntheir fathers and mothers before them. In this manner Paphos, and\r\nperhaps all sanctuaries of the great Asiatic goddess where sacred\r\nprostitution was practised, might be well stocked with human\r\ndeities, the offspring of the divine king by his wives, concubines,\r\nand temple harlots. Any one of these might probably succeed his\r\nfather on the throne or be sacrificed in his stead whenever stress\r\nof war or other grave junctures called, as they sometimes did, for\r\nthe death of a royal victim. Such a tax, levied occasionally on the\r\nking\'s numerous progeny for the good of the country, would neither\r\nextinguish the divine stock nor break the father\'s heart, who\r\ndivided his paternal affection among so many. At all events, if, as\r\nthere seems reason to believe, Semitic kings were often regarded at\r\nthe same time as hereditary deities, it is easy to understand the\r\nfrequency of Semitic personal names which imply that the bearers of\r\nthem were the sons or daughters, the brothers or sisters, the\r\nfathers or mothers of a god, and we need not resort to the shifts\r\nemployed by some scholars to evade the plain sense of the words.\r\nThis interpretation is confirmed by a parallel Egyptian usage; for\r\nin Egypt, where the kings were worshipped as divine, the queen was\r\ncalled "the wife of the god" or "the mother of the god," and the\r\ntitle "father of the god" was borne not only by the king\'s real\r\nfather but also by his father-in-law. Similarly, perhaps, among the\r\nSemites any man who sent his daughter to swell the royal harem may\r\nhave been allowed to call himself "the father of the god."\r\n\r\nIf we may judge by his name, the Semitic king who bore the name of\r\nCinyras was, like King David, a harper; for the name of Cinyras is\r\nclearly connected with the Greek _cinyra,_ "a lyre," which in its\r\nturn comes from the Semitic _kinnor,_ "a lyre," the very word\r\napplied to the instrument on which David played before Saul. We\r\nshall probably not err in assuming that at Paphos as at Jerusalem\r\nthe music of the lyre or harp was not a mere pastime designed to\r\nwhile away an idle hour, but formed part of the service of religion,\r\nthe moving influence of its melodies being perhaps set down, like\r\nthe effect of wine, to the direct inspiration of a deity. Certainly\r\nat Jerusalem the regular clergy of the temple prophesied to the\r\nmusic of harps, of psalteries, and of cymbals; and it appears that\r\nthe irregular clergy also, as we may call the prophets, depended on\r\nsome such stimulus for inducing the ecstatic state which they took\r\nfor immediate converse with the divinity. Thus we read of a band of\r\nprophets coming down from a high place with a psaltery, a timbrel, a\r\npipe, and a harp before them, and prophesying as they went. Again,\r\nwhen the united forces of Judah and Ephraim were traversing the\r\nwilderness of Moab in pursuit of the enemy, they could find no water\r\nfor three days, and were like to die of thirst, they and the beasts\r\nof burden. In this emergency the prophet Elisha, who was with the\r\narmy, called for a minstrel and bade him play. Under the influence\r\nof the music he ordered the soldiers to dig trenches in the sandy\r\nbed of the waterless waddy through which lay the line of march. They\r\ndid so, and next morning the trenches were full of the water that\r\nhad drained down into them underground from the desolate, forbidding\r\nmountains on either hand. The prophet\'s success in striking water in\r\nthe wilderness resembles the reported success of modern dowsers,\r\nthough his mode of procedure was different. Incidentally he rendered\r\nanother service to his countrymen. For the skulking Moabites from\r\ntheir lairs among the rocks saw the red sun of the desert reflected\r\nin the water, and taking it for the blood, or perhaps rather for an\r\nomen of the blood, of their enemies, they plucked up heart to attack\r\nthe camp and were defeated with great slaughter.\r\n\r\nAgain, just as the cloud of melancholy which from time to time\r\ndarkened the moody mind of Saul was viewed as an evil spirit from\r\nthe Lord vexing him, so on the other hand the solemn strains of the\r\nharp, which soothed and composed his troubled thoughts, may well\r\nhave seemed to the hag-ridden king the very voice of God or of his\r\ngood angel whispering peace. Even in our own day a great religious\r\nwriter, himself deeply sensitive to the witchery of music, has said\r\nthat musical notes, with all their power to fire the blood and melt\r\nthe heart, cannot be mere empty sounds and nothing more; no, they\r\nhave escaped from some higher sphere, they are outpourings of\r\neternal harmony, the voice of angels, the Magnificat of saints. It\r\nis thus that the rude imaginings of primitive man are transfigured\r\nand his feeble lispings echoed with a rolling reverberation in the\r\nmusical prose of Newman. Indeed the influence of music on the\r\ndevelopment of religion is a subject which would repay a sympathetic\r\nstudy. For we cannot doubt that this, the most intimate and\r\naffecting of all the arts, has done much to create as well as to\r\nexpress the religious emotions, thus modifying more or less deeply\r\nthe fabric of belief to which at first sight it seems only to\r\nminister. The musician has done his part as well as the prophet and\r\nthe thinker in the making of religion. Every faith has its\r\nappropriate music, and the difference between the creeds might\r\nalmost be expressed in musical notation. The interval, for example,\r\nwhich divides the wild revels of Cybele from the stately ritual of\r\nthe Catholic Church is measured by the gulf which severs the\r\ndissonant clash of cymbals and tambourines from the grave harmonies\r\nof Palestrina and Handel. A different spirit breathes in the\r\ndifference of the music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII. The Ritual of Adonis\r\n\r\nAT THE FESTIVALS of Adonis, which were held in Western Asia and in\r\nGreek lands, the death of the god was annually mourned, with a\r\nbitter wailing, chiefly by women; images of him, dressed to resemble\r\ncorpses, were carried out as to burial and then thrown into the sea\r\nor into springs; and in some places his revival was celebrated on\r\nthe following day. But at different places the ceremonies varied\r\nsomewhat in the manner and apparently also in the season of their\r\ncelebration. At Alexandria images of Aphrodite and Adonis were\r\ndisplayed on two couches; beside them were set ripe fruits of all\r\nkinds, cakes, plants growing in flower-pots, and green bowers twined\r\nwith anise. The marriage of the lovers was celebrated one day, and\r\non the morrow women attired as mourners, with streaming hair and\r\nbared breasts, bore the image of the dead Adonis to the sea-shore\r\nand committed it to the waves. Yet they sorrowed not without hope,\r\nfor they sang that the lost one would come back again. The date at\r\nwhich this Alexandrian ceremony was observed is not expressly\r\nstated; but from the mention of the ripe fruits it has been inferred\r\nthat it took place in late summer. In the great Phoenician sanctuary\r\nof Astarte at Byblus the death of Adonis was annually mourned, to\r\nthe shrill wailing notes of the flute, with weeping, lamentation,\r\nand beating of the breast; but next day he was believed to come to\r\nlife again and ascend up to heaven in the presence of his\r\nworshippers. The disconsolate believers, left behind on earth,\r\nshaved their heads as the Egyptians did on the death of the divine\r\nbull Apis; women who could not bring themselves to sacrifice their\r\nbeautiful tresses had to give themselves up to strangers on a\r\ncertain day of the festival, and to dedicate to Astarte the wages of\r\ntheir shame.\r\n\r\nThis Phoenician festival appears to have been a vernal one, for its\r\ndate was determined by the discoloration of the river Adonis, and\r\nthis has been observed by modern travellers to occur in spring. At\r\nthat season the red earth washed down from the mountains by the rain\r\ntinges the water of the river, and even the sea, for a great way\r\nwith a blood-red hue, and the crimson stain was believed to be the\r\nblood of Adonis, annually wounded to death by the boar on Mount\r\nLebanon. Again, the scarlet anemone is said to have sprung from the\r\nblood of Adonis, or to have been stained by it; and as the anemone\r\nblooms in Syria about Easter, this may be thought to show that the\r\nfestival of Adonis, or at least one of his festivals, was held in\r\nspring. The name of the flower is probably derived from Naaman\r\n("darling"), which seems to have been an epithet of Adonis. The\r\nArabs still call the anemone "wounds of the Naaman." The red rose\r\nalso was said to owe its hue to the same sad occasion; for\r\nAphrodite, hastening to her wounded lover, trod on a bush of white\r\nroses; the cruel thorns tore her tender flesh, and her sacred blood\r\ndyed the white roses for ever red. It would be idle, perhaps, to lay\r\nmuch weight on evidence drawn from the calendar of flowers, and in\r\nparticular to press an argument so fragile as the bloom of the rose.\r\nYet so far as it counts at all, the tale which links the damask rose\r\nwith the death of Adonis points to a summer rather than to a spring\r\ncelebration of his passion. In Attica, certainly, the festival fell\r\nat the height of summer. For the fleet which Athens fitted out\r\nagainst Syracuse, and by the destruction of which her power was\r\npermanently crippled, sailed at midsummer, and by an ominous\r\ncoincidence the sombre rites of Adonis were being celebrated at the\r\nvery time. As the troops marched down to the harbour to embark, the\r\nstreets through which they passed were lined with coffins and\r\ncorpse-like effigies, and the air was rent with the noise of women\r\nwailing for the dead Adonis. The circumstance cast a gloom over the\r\nsailing of the most splendid armament that Athens ever sent to sea.\r\nMany ages afterwards, when the Emperor Julian made his first entry\r\ninto Antioch, he found in like manner the gay, the luxurious capital\r\nof the East plunged in mimic grief for the annual death of Adonis;\r\nand if he had any presentiment of coming evil, the voices of\r\nlamentation which struck upon his ear must have seemed to sound his\r\nknell.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance of these ceremonies to the Indian and European\r\nceremonies which I have described elsewhere is obvious. In\r\nparticular, apart from the somewhat doubtful date of its\r\ncelebration, the Alexandrian ceremony is almost identical with the\r\nIndian. In both of them the marriage of two divine beings, whose\r\naffinity with vegetation seems indicated by the fresh plants with\r\nwhich they are surrounded, is celebrated in effigy, and the effigies\r\nare afterwards mourned over and thrown into the water. From the\r\nsimilarity of these customs to each other and to the spring and\r\nmidsummer customs of modern Europe we should naturally expect that\r\nthey all admit of a common explanation. Hence, if the explanation\r\nwhich I have adopted of the latter is correct, the ceremony of the\r\ndeath and resurrection of Adonis must also have been a dramatic\r\nrepresentation of the decay and revival of plant life. The inference\r\nthus based on the resemblance of the customs is confirmed by the\r\nfollowing features in the legend and ritual of Adonis. His affinity\r\nwith vegetation comes out at once in the common story of his birth.\r\nHe was said to have been born from a myrrh-tree, the bark of which\r\nbursting, after a ten months\' gestation, allowed the lovely infant\r\nto come forth. According to some, a boar rent the bark with his tusk\r\nand so opened a passage for the babe. A faint rationalistic colour\r\nwas given to the legend by saying that his mother was a woman named\r\nMyrrh, who had been turned into a myrrh-tree soon after she had\r\nconceived the child. The use of myrrh as incense at the festival of\r\nAdonis may have given rise to the fable. We have seen that incense\r\nwas burnt at the corresponding Babylonian rites, just as it was\r\nburnt by the idolatrous Hebrews in honour of the Queen of Heaven,\r\nwho was no other than Astarte. Again, the story that Adonis spent\r\nhalf, or according to others a third, of the year in the lower world\r\nand the rest of it in the upper world, is explained most simply and\r\nnaturally by supposing that he represented vegetation, especially\r\nthe corn, which lies buried in the earth half the year and reappears\r\nabove ground the other half. Certainly of the annual phenomena of\r\nnature there is none which suggests so obviously the idea of death\r\nand resurrection as the disappearance and reappearance of vegetation\r\nin autumn and spring. Adonis has been taken for the sun; but there\r\nis nothing in the sun\'s annual course within the temperate and\r\ntropical zones to suggest that he is dead for half or a third of the\r\nyear and alive for the other half or two-thirds. He might, indeed,\r\nbe conceived as weakened in winter, but dead he could not be thought\r\nto be; his daily reappearance contradicts the supposition. Within\r\nthe Arctic Circle, where the sun annually disappears for a\r\ncontinuous period which varies from twenty-four hours to six months\r\naccording to the latitude, his yearly death and resurrection would\r\ncertainly be an obvious idea; but no one except the unfortunate\r\nastronomer Bailly has maintained that the Adonis worship came from\r\nthe Arctic regions. On the other hand, the annual death and revival\r\nof vegetation is a conception which readily presents itself to men\r\nin every stage of savagery and civilisation; and the vastness of the\r\nscale on which this ever-recurring decay and regeneration takes\r\nplace, together with man\'s intimate dependence on it for\r\nsubsistence, combine to render it the most impressive annual\r\noccurrence in nature, at least within the temperate zones. It is no\r\nwonder that a phenomenon so important, so striking, and so universal\r\nshould, by suggesting similar ideas, have given rise to similar\r\nrites in many lands. We may, therefore, accept as probable an\r\nexplanation of the Adonis worship which accords so well with the\r\nfacts of nature and with the analogy of similar rites in other\r\nlands. Moreover, the explanation is countenanced by a considerable\r\nbody of opinion amongst the ancients themselves, who again and again\r\ninterpreted the dying and reviving god as the reaped and sprouting\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nThe character of Tammuz or Adonis as a corn-spirit comes out plainly\r\nin an account of his festival given by an Arabic writer of the tenth\r\ncentury. In describing the rites and sacrifices observed at the\r\ndifferent seasons of the year by the heathen Syrians of Harran, he\r\nsays: "Tammuz (July). In the middle of this month is the festival of\r\nel-B\xfbg\xe2t, that is, of the weeping women, and this is the T\xe2-uz\r\nfestival, which is celebrated in honour of the god T\xe2-uz. The women\r\nbewail him, because his lord slew him so cruelly, ground his bones\r\nin a mill, and then scattered them to the wind. The women (during\r\nthis festival) eat nothing which has been ground in a mill, but\r\nlimit their diet to steeped wheat, sweet vetches, dates, raisins,\r\nand the like." T\xe2-uz, who is no other than Tammuz, is here like\r\nBurns\'s John Barleycorn:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "They wasted o\'er a scorching flame\r\n    The marrow of his bones;\r\n    But a miller us\'d him worst of all--\r\n    For he crush\'d him between two stones."\r\n\r\n\r\nThis concentration, so to say, of the nature of Adonis upon the\r\ncereal crops is characteristic of the stage of culture reached by\r\nhis worshippers in historical times. They had left the nomadic life\r\nof the wandering hunter and herdsman far behind them; for ages they\r\nhad been settled on the land, and had depended for their subsistence\r\nmainly on the products of tillage. The berries and roots of the\r\nwilderness, the grass of the pastures, which had been matters of\r\nvital importance to their ruder forefathers, were now of little\r\nmoment to them: more and more their thoughts and energies were\r\nengrossed by the staple of their life, the corn; more and more\r\naccordingly the propitiation of the deities of fertility in general\r\nand of the corn-spirit in particular tended to become the central\r\nfeature of their religion. The aim they set before themselves in\r\ncelebrating the rites was thoroughly practical. It was no vague\r\npoetical sentiment which prompted them to hail with joy the rebirth\r\nof vegetation and to mourn its decline. Hunger, felt or feared, was\r\nthe mainspring of the worship of Adonis.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested by Father Lagrange that the mourning for\r\nAdonis was essentially a harvest rite designed to propitiate the\r\ncorngod, who was then either perishing under the sickles of the\r\nreapers, or being trodden to death under the hoofs of the oxen on\r\nthe threshing-floor. While the men slew him, the women wept\r\ncrocodile tears at home to appease his natural indignation by a show\r\nof grief for his death. The theory fits in well with the dates of\r\nthe festivals, which fell in spring or summer; for spring and\r\nsummer, not autumn, are the seasons of the barley and wheat harvests\r\nin the lands which worshipped Adonis. Further, the hypothesis is\r\nconfirmed by the practice of the Egyptian reapers, who lamented,\r\ncalling upon Isis, when they cut the first corn; and it is\r\nrecommended by the analogous customs of many hunting tribes, who\r\ntestify great respect for the animals which they kill and eat.\r\n\r\nThus interpreted the death of Adonis is not the natural decay of\r\nvegetation in general under the summer heat or the winter cold; it\r\nis the violent destruction of the corn by man, who cuts it down on\r\nthe field, stamps it to pieces on the threshing-floor, and grinds it\r\nto powder in the mill. That this was indeed the principal aspect in\r\nwhich Adonis presented himself in later times to the agricultural\r\npeoples of the Levant, may be admitted; but whether from the\r\nbeginning he had been the corn and nothing but the corn, may be\r\ndoubted. At an earlier period he may have been to the herdsman,\r\nabove all, the tender herbage which sprouts after rain, offering\r\nrich pasture to the lean and hungry cattle. Earlier still he may\r\nhave embodied the spirit of the nuts and berries which the autumn\r\nwoods yield to the savage hunter and his squaw. And just as the\r\nhusband-man must propitiate the spirit of the corn which he\r\nconsumes, so the herdsman must appease the spirit of the grass and\r\nleaves which his cattle munch, and the hunter must soothe the spirit\r\nof the roots which he digs, and of the fruits which he gathers from\r\nthe bough. In all cases the propitiation of the injured and angry,\r\nsprite would naturally comprise elaborate excuses and apologies,\r\naccompanied by loud lamentations at his decease whenever, through\r\nsome deplorable accident or necessity, he happened to be murdered as\r\nwell as robbed. Only we must bear in mind that the savage hunter and\r\nherdsman of those early days had probably not yet attained to the\r\nabstract idea of vegetation in general; and that accordingly, so far\r\nas Adonis existed for them at all, he must have been the _Adon_ or\r\nlord of each individual tree and plant rather than a personification\r\nof vegetable life as a whole. Thus there would be as many Adonises\r\nas there were trees and shrubs, and each of them might expect to\r\nreceive satisfaction for any damage done to his person or property.\r\nAnd year by year, when the trees were deciduous, every Adonis would\r\nseem to bleed to death with the red leaves of autumn and to come to\r\nlife again with the fresh green of spring.\r\n\r\nThere is some reason to think that in early times Adonis was\r\nsometimes personated by a living man who died a violent death in the\r\ncharacter of the god. Further, there is evidence which goes to show\r\nthat among the agricultural peoples of the Eastern Mediterranean,\r\nthe corn-spirit, by whatever name he was known, was often\r\nrepresented, year by year, by human victims slain on the\r\nharvest-field. If that was so, it seems likely that the propitiation\r\nof the corn-spirit would tend to fuse to some extent with the\r\nworship of the dead. For the spirits of these victims might be\r\nthought to return to life in the ears which they had fattened with\r\ntheir blood, and to die a second death at the reaping of the corn.\r\nNow the ghosts of those who have perished by violence are surly and\r\napt to wreak their vengeance on their slayers whenever an\r\nopportunity offers. Hence the attempt to appease the souls of the\r\nslaughtered victims would naturally blend, at least in the popular\r\nconception, with the attempt to pacify the slain corn-spirit. And as\r\nthe dead came back in the sprouting corn, so they might be thought\r\nto return in the spring flowers, waked from their long sleep by the\r\nsoft vernal airs. They had been laid to their rest under the sod.\r\nWhat more natural than to imagine that the violets and the\r\nhyacinths, the roses and the anemones, sprang from their dust, were\r\nempurpled or incarnadined by their blood, and contained some portion\r\nof their spirit?\r\n\r\n\r\n   "I sometimes think that never blows so red\r\n    The Rose as where some buried Caesar bled;\r\n    That every Hyacinth the Garden wears\r\n    Dropt in her Lap from some once lovely Head.\r\n\r\n   "And this reviving Herb whose tender Green\r\n    Fledges the River-Lip on which we lean--\r\n    Ah, lean upon it lightly, for who knows\r\n    From what once lovely Lip it springs unseen?"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer after the battle of Landen, the most sanguinary battle\r\nof the seventeenth century in Europe, the earth, saturated with the\r\nblood of twenty thousand slain, broke forth into millions of\r\npoppies, and the traveller who passed that vast sheet of scarlet\r\nmight well fancy that the earth had indeed given up her dead. At\r\nAthens the great Commemoration of the Dead fell in spring about the\r\nmiddle of March, when the early flowers are in bloom. Then the dead\r\nwere believed to rise from their graves and go about the streets,\r\nvainly endeavouring to enter the temples and dwellings, which were\r\nbarred against these perturbed spirits with ropes, buckthorn, and\r\npitch. The name of the festival, according to the most obvious and\r\nnatural interpretation, means the Festival of Flowers, and the title\r\nwould fit well with the substance of the ceremonies if at that\r\nseason the poor ghosts were indeed thought to creep from the narrow\r\nhouse with the opening flowers. There may therefore be a measure of\r\ntruth in the theory of Renan, who saw in the Adonis worship a dreamy\r\nvoluptuous cult of death, conceived not as the King of Terrors, but\r\nas an insidious enchanter who lures his victims to himself and lulls\r\nthem into an eternal sleep. The infinite charm of nature in the\r\nLebanon, he thought, lends itself to religious emotions of this\r\nsensuous, visionary sort, hovering vaguely between pain and\r\npleasure, between slumber and tears. It would doubtless be a mistake\r\nto attribute to Syrian peasants the worship of a conception so\r\npurely abstract as that of death in general. Yet it may be true that\r\nin their simple minds the thought of the reviving spirit of\r\nvegetation was blent with the very concrete notion of the ghosts of\r\nthe dead, who come to life again in spring days with the early\r\nflowers, with the tender green of the corn and the many-tinted\r\nblossoms of the trees. Thus their views of the death and\r\nresurrection of nature would be coloured by their views of the death\r\nand resurrection of man, by their personal sorrows and hopes and\r\nfears. In like manner we cannot doubt that Renan\'s theory of Adonis\r\nwas itself deeply tinged by passionate memories, memories of the\r\nslumber akin to death which sealed his own eyes on the slopes of the\r\nLebanon, memories of the sister who sleeps in the land of Adonis\r\nnever again to wake with the anemones and the roses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII. The Gardens of Adonis\r\n\r\nPERHAPS the best proof that Adonis was a deity of vegetation, and\r\nespecially of the corn, is furnished by the gardens of Adonis, as\r\nthey were called. These were baskets or pots filled with earth, in\r\nwhich wheat, barley, lettuces, fennel, and various kinds of flowers\r\nwere sown and tended for eight days, chiefly or exclusively by\r\nwomen. Fostered by the sun\'s heat, the plants shot up rapidly, but\r\nhaving no root they withered as rapidly away, and at the end of\r\neight days were carried out with the images of the dead Adonis, and\r\nflung with them into the sea or into springs.\r\n\r\nThese gardens of Adonis are most naturally interpreted as\r\nrepresentatives of Adonis or manifestations of his power; they\r\nrepresented him, true to his original nature, in vegetable form,\r\nwhile the images of him, with which they were carried out and cast\r\ninto the water, portrayed him in his later human shape. All these\r\nAdonis ceremonies, if I am right, were originally intended as charms\r\nto promote the growth or revival of vegetation; and the principle by\r\nwhich they were supposed to produce this effect was homoeopathic or\r\nimitative magic. For ignorant people suppose that by mimicking the\r\neffect which they desire to produce they actually help to produce\r\nit; thus by sprinkling water they make rain, by lighting a fire they\r\nmake sunshine, and so on. Similarly, by mimicking the growth of\r\ncrops they hope to ensure a good harvest. The rapid growth of the\r\nwheat and barley in the gardens of Adonis was intended to make the\r\ncorn shoot up; and the throwing of the gardens and of the images\r\ninto the water was a charm to secure a due supply of fertilising\r\nrain. The same, I take it, was the object of throwing the effigies\r\nof Death and the Carnival into water in the corresponding ceremonies\r\nof modern Europe. Certainly the custom of drenching with water a\r\nleaf-clad person, who undoubtedly personifies vegetation, is still\r\nresorted to in Europe for the express purpose of producing rain.\r\nSimilarly the custom of throwing water on the last corn cut at\r\nharvest, or on the person who brings it home (a custom observed in\r\nGermany and France, and till lately in England and Scotland), is in\r\nsome places practised with the avowed intent to procure rain for the\r\nnext year\'s crops. Thus in Wallachia and amongst the Roumanians in\r\nTransylvania, when a girl is bringing home a crown made of the last\r\nears of corn cut at harvest, all who meet her hasten to throw water\r\non her, and two farm-servants are placed at the door for the\r\npurpose; for they believe that if this were not done, the crops next\r\nyear would perish from drought. At the spring ploughing in Prussia,\r\nwhen the ploughmen and sowers returned in the evening from their\r\nwork in the fields, the farmer\'s wife and the servants used to\r\nsplash water over them. The ploughmen and sowers retorted by seizing\r\nevery one, throwing them into the pond, and ducking them under the\r\nwater. The farmer\'s wife might claim exemption on payment of a\r\nforfeit, but every one else had to be ducked. By observing this\r\ncustom they hoped to ensure a due supply of rain for the seed.\r\n\r\nThe opinion that the gardens of Adonis are essentially charms to\r\npromote the growth of vegetation, especially of the crops, and that\r\nthey belong to the same class of customs as those spring and\r\nmid-summer folk-customs of modern Europe which I have described\r\nelse-where, does not rest for its evidence merely on the intrinsic\r\nprobability of the case. Fortunately we are able to show that\r\ngardens of Adonis (if we may use the expression in a general sense)\r\nare still planted, first, by a primitive race at their sowing\r\nseason, and, second, by European peasants at midsummer. Amongst the\r\nOraons and Mundas of Bengal, when the time comes for planting out\r\nthe rice which has been grown in seed-beds, a party of young people\r\nof both sexes go to the forest and cut a young Karma-tree, or the\r\nbranch of one. Bearing it in triumph they return dancing, singing,\r\nand beating drums, and plant it in the middle of the village\r\ndancing-ground. A sacrifice is offered to the tree; and next morning\r\nthe youth of both sexes, linked arm-in-arm, dance in a great circle\r\nround the Karma-tree, which is decked with strips of coloured cloth\r\nand sham bracelets and necklets of plaited straw. As a preparation\r\nfor the festival, the daughters of the headman of the village\r\ncultivate blades of barley in a peculiar way. The seed is sown in\r\nmoist, sandy soil, mixed with turmeric, and the blades sprout and\r\nunfold of a pale-yellow or primrose colour. On the day of the\r\nfestival the girls take up these blades and carry them in baskets to\r\nthe dancing-ground, where, prostrating themselves reverentially,\r\nthey place some of the plants before the Karma-tree. Finally, the\r\nKarma-tree is taken away and thrown into a stream or tank. The\r\nmeaning of planting these barley blades and then presenting them to\r\nthe Karma-tree is hardly open to question. Trees are supposed to\r\nexercise a quickening influence upon the growth of crops, and\r\namongst the very people in question--the Mundas or Mundaris--"the\r\ngrove deities are held responsible for the crops." Therefore, when\r\nat the season for planting out the rice the Mundas bring in a tree\r\nand treat it with so much respect, their object can only be to\r\nfoster thereby the growth of the rice which is about to be planted\r\nout; and the custom of causing barley blades to sprout rapidly and\r\nthen presenting them to the tree must be intended to subserve the\r\nsame purpose, perhaps by reminding the tree-spirit of his duty\r\ntowards the crops, and stimulating his activity by this visible\r\nexample of rapid vegetable growth. The throwing of the Karma-tree\r\ninto the water is to be interpreted as a rain-charm. Whether the\r\nbarley blades are also thrown into the water is not said; but if my\r\ninterpretation of the custom is right, probably they are so. A\r\ndistinction between this Bengal custom and the Greek rites of Adonis\r\nis that in the former the tree-spirit appears in his original form\r\nas a tree; whereas in the Adonis worship he appears in human form,\r\nrepresented as a dead man, though his vegetable nature is indicated\r\nby the gardens of Adonis, which are, so to say, a secondary\r\nmanifestation of his original power as a tree-spirit.\r\n\r\nGardens of Adonis are cultivated also by the Hindoos, with the\r\nintention apparently of ensuring the fertility both of the earth and\r\nof mankind. Thus at Oodeypoor in Rajputana a festival is held in\r\nhonour of Gouri, or Isani, the goddess of abundance. The rites begin\r\nwhen the sun enters the sign of the Ram, the opening of the Hindoo\r\nyear. An image of the goddess Gouri is made of earth, and a smaller\r\none of her husband Iswara, and the two are placed together. A small\r\ntrench is next dug, barley is sown in it, and the ground watered and\r\nheated artificially till the grain sprouts, when the women dance\r\nround it hand in hand, invoking the blessing of Gouri on their\r\nhusbands. After that the young corn is taken up and distributed by\r\nthe women to the men, who wear it in their turbans. In these rites\r\nthe distribution of the barley shoots to the men, and the invocation\r\nof a blessing on their husbands by the wives, point clearly to the\r\ndesire of offspring as one motive for observing the custom. The same\r\nmotive probably explains the use of gardens of Adonis at the\r\nmarriage of Brahmans in the Madras Presidency. Seeds of five or nine\r\nsorts are mixed and sown in earthen pots, which are made specially\r\nfor the purpose and are filled with earth. Bride and bridegroom\r\nwater the seeds both morning and evening for four days; and on the\r\nfifth day the seedlings are thrown, like the real gardens of Adonis,\r\ninto a tank or river.\r\n\r\nIn Sardinia the gardens of Adonis are still planted in connexion\r\nwith the great midsummer festival which bears the name of St. John.\r\nAt the end of March or on the first of April a young man of the\r\nvillage presents himself to a girl, and asks her to be his _comare_\r\n(gossip or sweetheart), offering to be her _compare._ The invitation\r\nis considered as an honour by the girl\'s family, and is gladly\r\naccepted. At the end of May the girl makes a pot of the bark of the\r\ncork-tree, fills it with earth, and sows a handful of wheat and\r\nbarley in it. The pot being placed in the sun and often watered, the\r\ncorn sprouts rapidly and has a good head by Midsummer Eve (St.\r\nJohn\'s Eve, the twenty-third of June). The pot is then called _Erme_\r\nor _Nenneri._ On St. John\'s Day the young man and the girl, dressed\r\nin their best, accompanied by a long retinue and preceded by\r\nchildren gambolling and frolicking, move in procession to a church\r\noutside the village. Here they break the pot by throwing it against\r\nthe door of the church. Then they sit down in a ring on the grass\r\nand eat eggs and herbs to the music of flutes. Wine is mixed in a\r\ncup and passed round, each one drinking as it passes. Then they join\r\nhands and sing "Sweethearts of St. John" (_Compare e comare di San\r\nGiovanni_) over and over again, the flutes playing the while. When\r\nthey tire of singing they stand up and dance gaily in a ring till\r\nevening. This is the general Sardinian custom. As practised at\r\nOzieri it has some special features. In May the pots are made of\r\ncork-bark and planted with corn, as already described. Then on the\r\nEve of St. John the window-sills are draped with rich cloths, on\r\nwhich the pots are placed, adorned with crimson and blue silk and\r\nribbons of various colours. On each of the pots they used formerly\r\nto place a statuette or cloth doll dressed as a woman, or a\r\nPriapus-like figure made of paste; but this custom, rigorously\r\nforbidden by the Church, has fallen into disuse. The village swains\r\ngo about in a troop to look at the pots and their decorations and to\r\nwait for the girls, who assemble on the public square to celebrate\r\nthe festival. Here a great bonfire is kindled, round which they\r\ndance and make merry. Those who wish to be "Sweethearts of St. John"\r\nact as follows. The young man stands on one side of the bonfire and\r\nthe girl on the other, and they, in a manner, join hands by each\r\ngrasping one end of a long stick, which they pass three times\r\nbackwards and forwards across the fire, thus thrusting their hands\r\nthrice rapidly into the flames. This seals their relationship to\r\neach other. Dancing and music go on till late at night. The\r\ncorrespondence of these Sardinian pots of grain to the gardens of\r\nAdonis seems complete, and the images formerly placed in them answer\r\nto the images of Adonis which accompanied his gardens.\r\n\r\nCustoms of the same sort are observed at the same season in Sicily.\r\nPairs of boys and girls become gossips of St. John on St. John\'s Day\r\nby drawing each a hair from his or her head and performing various\r\nceremonies over them. Thus they tie the hairs together and throw\r\nthem up in the air, or exchange them over a potsherd, which they\r\nafterwards break in two, preserving each a fragment with pious care.\r\nThe tie formed in the latter way is supposed to last for life. In\r\nsome parts of Sicily the gossips of St. John present each other with\r\nplates of sprouting corn, lentils, and canary seed, which have been\r\nplanted forty days before the festival. The one who receives the\r\nplate pulls a stalk of the young plants, binds it with a ribbon, and\r\npreserves it among his or her greatest treasures, restoring the\r\nplatter to the giver. At Catania the gossips exchange pots of basil\r\nand great cucumbers; the girls tend the basil, and the thicker it\r\ngrows the more it is prized.\r\n\r\nIn these midsummer customs of Sardinia and Sicily it is possible\r\nthat, as Mr. R. W\xfcnsch supposes, St. John has replaced Adonis. We\r\nhave seen that the rites of Tammuz or Adonis were commonly\r\ncelebrated about midsummer; according to Jerome, their date was\r\nJune.\r\n\r\nIn Sicily gardens of Adonis are still sown in spring as well as in\r\nsummer, from which we may perhaps infer that Sicily as well as Syria\r\ncelebrated of old a vernal festival of the dead and risen god. At\r\nthe approach of Easter, Sicilian women sow wheat, lentils, and\r\ncanaryseed in plates, which they keep in the dark and water every\r\ntwo days. The plants soon shoot up; the stalks are tied together\r\nwith red ribbons, and the plates containing them are placed on the\r\nsepulchres which, with the effigies of the dead Christ, are made up\r\nin Catholic and Greek churches on Good Friday, just as the gardens\r\nof Adonis were placed on the grave of the dead Adonis. The practice\r\nis not confined to Sicily, for it is observed also at Cosenza in\r\nCalabria, and perhaps in other places. The whole custom--sepulchres\r\nas well as plates of sprouting grain--may be nothing but a\r\ncontinuation, under a different name, of the worship of Adonis.\r\n\r\nNor are these Sicilian and Calabrian customs the only Easter\r\nceremonies which resemble the rites of Adonis. "During the whole of\r\nGood Friday a waxen effigy of the dead Christ is exposed to view in\r\nthe middle of the Greek churches and is covered with fervent kisses\r\nby the thronging crowd, while the whole church rings with\r\nmelancholy, monotonous dirges. Late in the evening, when it has\r\ngrown quite dark, this waxen image is carried by the priests into\r\nthe street on a bier adorned with lemons, roses, jessamine, and\r\nother flowers, and there begins a grand procession of the multitude,\r\nwho move in serried ranks, with slow and solemn step, through the\r\nwhole town. Every man carries his taper and breaks out into doleful\r\nlamentation. At all the houses which the procession passes there are\r\nseated women with censers to fumigate the marching host. Thus the\r\ncommunity solemnly buries its Christ as if he had just died. At last\r\nthe waxen image is again deposited in the church, and the same\r\nlugubrious chants echo anew. These lamentations, accompanied by a\r\nstrict fast, continue till midnight on Saturday. As the clock\r\nstrikes twelve, the bishop appears and announces the glad tidings\r\nthat \'Christ is risen,\' to which the crowd replies, \'He is risen\r\nindeed,\' and at once the whole city bursts into an uproar of joy,\r\nwhich finds vent in shrieks and shouts, in the endless discharge of\r\ncarronades and muskets, and the explosion of fire-works of every\r\nsort. In the very same hour people plunge from the extremity of the\r\nfast into the enjoyment of the Easter lamb and neat wine."\r\n\r\nIn like manner the Catholic Church has been accustomed to bring\r\nbefore its followers in a visible form the death and resurrection of\r\nthe Redeemer. Such sacred dramas are well fitted to impress the\r\nlively imagination and to stir the warm feelings of a susceptible\r\nsouthern race, to whom the pomp and pageantry of Catholicism are\r\nmore congenial than to the colder temperament of the Teutonic\r\npeoples.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect how often the Church has skilfully contrived to\r\nplant the seeds of the new faith on the old stock of paganism, we\r\nmay surmise that the Easter celebration of the dead and risen Christ\r\nwas grafted upon a similar celebration of the dead and risen Adonis,\r\nwhich, as we have seen reason to believe, was celebrated in Syria at\r\nthe same season. The type, created by Greek artists, of the\r\nsorrowful goddess with her dying lover in her arms, resembles and\r\nmay have been the model of the _Piet\xe0_ of Christian art, the Virgin\r\nwith the dead body of her divine Son in her lap, of which the most\r\ncelebrated example is the one by Michael Angelo in St. Peters. That\r\nnoble group, in which the living sorrow of the mother contrasts so\r\nwonderfully with the languor of death in the son, is one of the\r\nfinest compositions in marble. Ancient Greek art has bequeathed to\r\nus few works so beautiful, and none so pathetic.\r\n\r\nIn this connexion a well-known statement of Jerome may not be\r\nwithout significance. He tells us that Bethlehem, the traditionary\r\nbirthplace of the Lord, was shaded by a grove of that still older\r\nSyrian Lord, Adonis, and that where the infant Jesus had wept, the\r\nlover of Venus was bewailed. Though he does not expressly say so,\r\nJerome seems to have thought that the grove of Adonis had been\r\nplanted by the heathen after the birth of Christ for the purpose of\r\ndefiling the sacred spot. In this he may have been mistaken. If\r\nAdonis was indeed, as I have argued, the spirit of the corn, a more\r\nsuitable name for his dwelling-place could hardly be found than\r\nBethlehem, "the House of Bread," and he may well have been\r\nworshipped there at his House of Bread long ages before the birth of\r\nHim who said, "I am the bread of life." Even on the hypothesis that\r\nAdonis followed rather than preceded Christ at Bethlehem, the choice\r\nof his sad figure to divert the allegiance of Christians from their\r\nLord cannot but strike us as eminently appropriate when we remember\r\nthe similarity of the rites which commemorated the death and\r\nresurrection of the two. One of the earliest seats of the worship of\r\nthe new god was Antioch, and at Antioch, as we have seen, the death\r\nof the old god was annually celebrated with great solemnity. A\r\ncircumstance which attended the entrance of Julian into the city at\r\nthe time of the Adonis festival may perhaps throw some light on the\r\ndate of its celebration. When the emperor drew near to the city he\r\nwas received with public prayers as if he had been a god, and he\r\nmarvelled at the voices of a great multitude who cried that the Star\r\nof Salvation had dawned upon them in the East. This may doubtless\r\nhave been no more than a fulsome compliment paid by an obsequious\r\nOriental crowd to the Roman emperor. But it is also possible that\r\nthe rising of a bright star regularly gave the signal for the\r\nfestival, and that as chance would have it the star emerged above\r\nthe rim of the eastern horizon at the very moment of the emperor\'s\r\napproach. The coincidence, if it happened, could hardly fail to\r\nstrike the imagination of a superstitious and excited multitude, who\r\nmight thereupon hail the great man as the deity whose coming was\r\nannounced by the sign in the heavens. Or the emperor may have\r\nmistaken for a greeting to himself the shouts which were addressed\r\nto the star. Now Astarte, the divine mistress of Adonis, was\r\nidentified with the planet Venus, and her changes from a morning to\r\nan evening star were carefully noted by the Babylonian astronomers,\r\nwho drew omens from her alternate appearance and disappearance.\r\nHence we may conjecture that the festival of Adonis was regularly\r\ntimed to coincide with the appearance of Venus as the Morning or\r\nEvening Star. But the star which the people of Antioch saluted at\r\nthe festival was seen in the East; therefore, if it was indeed\r\nVenus, it can only have been the Morning Star. At Aphaca in Syria,\r\nwhere there was a famous temple of Astarte, the signal for the\r\ncelebration of the rites was apparently given by the flashing of a\r\nmeteor, which on a certain day fell like a star from the top of\r\nMount Lebanon into the river Adonis. The meteor was thought to be\r\nAstarte herself, and its flight through the air might naturally be\r\ninterpreted as the descent of the amorous goddess to the arms of her\r\nlover. At Antioch and elsewhere the appearance of the Morning Star\r\non the day of the festival may in like manner have been hailed as\r\nthe coming of the goddess of love to wake her dead leman from his\r\nearthy bed. If that were so, we may surmise that it was the Morning\r\nStar which guided the wise men of the East to Bethlehem, the\r\nhallowed spot which heard, in the language of Jerome, the weeping of\r\nthe infant Christ and the lament for Adonis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV. The Myth and Ritual of Attis\r\n\r\nANOTHER of those gods whose supposed death and resurrection struck\r\nsuch deep roots into the faith and ritual of Western Asia is Attis.\r\nHe was to Phrygia what Adonis was to Syria. Like Adonis, he appears\r\nto have been a god of vegetation, and his death and resurrection\r\nwere annually mourned and rejoiced over at a festival in spring. The\r\nlegends and rites of the two gods were so much alike that the\r\nancients themselves sometimes identified them. Attis was said to\r\nhave been a fair young shepherd or herdsman beloved by Cybele, the\r\nMother of the Gods, a great Asiatic goddess of fertility, who had\r\nher chief home in Phrygia. Some held that Attis was her son. His\r\nbirth, like that of many other heroes, is said to have been\r\nmiraculous. His mother, Nana, was a virgin, who conceived by putting\r\na ripe almond or a pomegranate in her bosom. Indeed in the Phrygian\r\ncosmogony an almond figured as the father of all things, perhaps\r\nbecause its delicate lilac blossom is one of the first heralds of\r\nthe spring, appearing on the bare boughs before the leaves have\r\nopened. Such tales of virgin mothers are relics of an age of\r\nchildish ignorance when men had not yet recognized the intercourse\r\nof the sexes as the true cause of offspring. Two different accounts\r\nof the death of Attis were current. According to the one he was\r\nkilled by a boar, like Adonis. According to the other he unmanned\r\nhimself under a pine-tree, and bled to death on the spot. The latter\r\nis said to have been the local story told by the people of Pessinus,\r\na great seat of the worship of Cybele, and the whole legend of which\r\nthe story forms a part is stamped with a character of rudeness and\r\nsavagery that speaks strongly for its antiquity. Both tales might\r\nclaim the support of custom, or rather both were probably invented\r\nto explain certain customs observed by the worshippers. The story of\r\nthe self-mutilation of Attis is clearly an attempt to account for\r\nthe self-mutilation of his priests, who regularly castrated\r\nthemselves on entering the service of the goddess. The story of his\r\ndeath by the boar may have been told to explain why his worshippers,\r\nespecially the people of Pessinus, abstained from eating swine. In\r\nlike manner the worshippers of Adonis abstained from pork, because a\r\nboar had killed their god. After his death Attis is said to have\r\nbeen changed into a pine-tree.\r\n\r\nThe worship of the Phrygian Mother of the Gods was adopted by the\r\nRomans in 204 B.C. towards the close of their long struggle with\r\nHannibal. For their drooping spirits had been opportunely cheered by\r\na prophecy, alleged to be drawn from that convenient farrago of\r\nnonsense, the Sibylline Books, that the foreign invader would be\r\ndriven from Italy if the great Oriental goddess were brought to\r\nRome. Accordingly ambassadors were despatched to her sacred city\r\nPessinus in Phrygia. The small black stone which embodied the mighty\r\ndivinity was entrusted to them and conveyed to Rome, where it was\r\nreceived with great respect and installed in the temple of Victory\r\non the Palatine Hill. It was the middle of April when the goddess\r\narrived, and she went to work at once. For the harvest that year was\r\nsuch as had not been seen for many a long day, and in the very next\r\nyear Hannibal and his veterans embarked for Africa. As he looked his\r\nlast on the coast of Italy, fading behind him in the distance, he\r\ncould not foresee that Europe, which had repelled the arms, would\r\nyet yield to the gods, of the Orient. The vanguard of the conquerors\r\nhad already encamped in the heart of Italy before the rearguard of\r\nthe beaten army fell sullenly back from its shores.\r\n\r\nWe may conjecture, though we are not told, that the Mother of the\r\nGods brought with her the worship of her youthful lover or son to\r\nher new home in the West. Certainly the Romans were familiar with\r\nthe Galli, the emasculated priests of Attis, before the close of the\r\nRepublic. These unsexed beings, in their Oriental costume, with\r\nlittle images suspended on their breasts, appear to have been a\r\nfamiliar sight in the streets of Rome, which they traversed in\r\nprocession, carrying the image of the goddess and chanting their\r\nhymns to the music of cymbals and tambourines, flutes and horns,\r\nwhile the people, impressed by the fantastic show and moved by the\r\nwild strains, flung alms to them in abundance, and buried the image\r\nand its bearers under showers of roses. A further step was taken by\r\nthe Emperor Claudius when he incorporated the Phrygian worship of\r\nthe sacred tree, and with it probably the orgiastic rites of Attis,\r\nin the established religion of Rome. The great spring festival of\r\nCybele and Attis is best known to us in the form in which it was\r\ncelebrated at Rome; but as we are informed that the Roman ceremonies\r\nwere also Phrygian, we may assume that they differed hardly, if at\r\nall, from their Asiatic original. The order of the festival seems to\r\nhave been as follows.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-second day of March, a pine-tree was cut in the woods\r\nand brought into the sanctuary of Cybele, where it was treated as a\r\ngreat divinity. The duty of carrying the sacred tree was entrusted\r\nto a guild of Tree-bearers. The trunk was swathed like a corpse with\r\nwoollen bands and decked with wreaths of violets, for violets were\r\nsaid to have sprung from the blood of Attis, as roses and anemones\r\nfrom the blood of Adonis; and the effigy of a young man, doubtless\r\nAttis himself, was tied to the middle of the stem. On the second day\r\nof the festival, the twenty-third of March, the chief ceremony seems\r\nto have been a blowing of trumpets. The third day, the twenty-fourth\r\nof March, was known as the Day of Blood: the Archigallus or\r\nhighpriest drew blood from his arms and presented it as an offering.\r\nNor was he alone in making this bloody sacrifice. Stirred by the\r\nwild barbaric music of clashing cymbals, rumbling drums, droning\r\nhorns, and screaming flutes, the inferior clergy whirled about in\r\nthe dance with waggling heads and streaming hair, until, rapt into a\r\nfrenzy of excitement and insensible to pain, they gashed their\r\nbodies with potsherds or slashed them with knives in order to\r\nbespatter the altar and the sacred tree with their flowing blood.\r\nThe ghastly rite probably formed part of the mourning for Attis and\r\nmay have been intended to strengthen him for the resurrection. The\r\nAustralian aborigines cut themselves in like manner over the graves\r\nof their friends for the purpose, perhaps, of enabling them to be\r\nborn again. Further, we may conjecture, though we are not expressly\r\ntold, that it was on the same Day of Blood and for the same purpose\r\nthat the novices sacrificed their virility. Wrought up to the\r\nhighest pitch of religious excitement they dashed the severed\r\nportions of themselves against the image of the cruel goddess. These\r\nbroken instruments of fertility were afterwards reverently wrapt up\r\nand buried in the earth or in subterranean chambers sacred to\r\nCybele, where, like the offering of blood, they may have been deemed\r\ninstrumental in recalling Attis to life and hastening the general\r\nresurrection of nature, which was then bursting into leaf and\r\nblossom in the vernal sunshine. Some confirmation of this conjecture\r\nis furnished by the savage story that the mother of Attis conceived\r\nby putting in her bosom a pomegranate sprung from the severed\r\ngenitals of a man-monster named Agdestis, a sort of double of Attis.\r\n\r\nIf there is any truth in this conjectural explanation of the custom,\r\nwe can readily understand why other Asiatic goddesses of fertility\r\nwere served in like manner by eunuch priests. These feminine deities\r\nrequired to receive from their male ministers, who personated the\r\ndivine lovers, the means of discharging their beneficent functions:\r\nthey had themselves to be impregnated by the life-giving energy\r\nbefore they could transmit it to the world. Goddesses thus\r\nministered to by eunuch priests were the great Artemis of Ephesus\r\nand the great Syrian Astarte of Hierapolis, whose sanctuary,\r\nfrequented by swarms of pilgrims and enriched by the offerings of\r\nAssyria and Babylonia, of Arabia and Phoenicia, was perhaps in the\r\ndays of its glory the most popular in the East. Now the unsexed\r\npriests of this Syrian goddess resembled those of Cybele so closely\r\nthat some people took them to be the same. And the mode in which\r\nthey dedicated themselves to the religious life was similar. The\r\ngreatest festival of the year at Hierapolis fell at the beginning of\r\nspring, when multitudes thronged to the sanctuary from Syria and the\r\nregions round about. While the flutes played, the drums beat, and\r\nthe eunuch priests slashed themselves with knives, the religious\r\nexcitement gradually spread like a wave among the crowd of\r\nonlookers, and many a one did that which he little thought to do\r\nwhen he came as a holiday spectator to the festival. For man after\r\nman, his veins throbbing with the music, his eyes fascinated by the\r\nsight of the streaming blood, flung his garments from him, leaped\r\nforth with a shout, and seizing one of the swords which stood ready\r\nfor the purpose, castrated himself on the spot. Then he ran through\r\nthe city, holding the bloody pieces in his hand, till he threw them\r\ninto one of the houses which he passed in his mad career. The\r\nhousehold thus honoured had to furnish him with a suit of female\r\nattire and female ornaments, which he wore for the rest of his life.\r\nWhen the tumult of emotion had subsided, and the man had come to\r\nhimself again, the irrevocable sacrifice must often have been\r\nfollowed by passionate sorrow and lifelong regret. This revulsion of\r\nnatural human feeling after the frenzies of a fanatical religion is\r\npowerfully depicted by Catullus in a celebrated poem.\r\n\r\nThe parallel of these Syrian devotees confirms the view that in the\r\nsimilar worship of Cybele the sacrifice of virility took place on\r\nthe Day of Blood at the vernal rites of the goddess, when the\r\nviolets, supposed to spring from the red drops of her wounded lover,\r\nwere in bloom among the pines. Indeed the story that Attis unmanned\r\nhimself under a pine-tree was clearly devised to explain why his\r\npriests did the same beside the sacred violet-wreathed tree at his\r\nfestival. At all events, we can hardly doubt that the Day of Blood\r\nwitnessed the mourning for Attis over an effigy of him which was\r\nafterwards buried. The image thus laid in the sepulchre was probably\r\nthe same which had hung upon the tree. Throughout the period of\r\nmourning the worshippers fasted from bread, nominally because Cybele\r\nhad done so in her grief for the death of Attis, but really perhaps\r\nfor the same reason which induced the women of Harran to abstain\r\nfrom eating anything ground in a mill while they wept for Tammuz. To\r\npartake of bread or flour at such a season might have been deemed a\r\nwanton profanation of the bruised and broken body of the god. Or the\r\nfast may possibly have been a preparation for a sacramental meal.\r\n\r\nBut when night had fallen, the sorrow of the worshippers was turned\r\nto joy. For suddenly a light shone in the darkness: the tomb was\r\nopened: the god had risen from the dead; and as the priest touched\r\nthe lips of the weeping mourners with balm, he softly whispered in\r\ntheir ears the glad tidings of salvation. The resurrection of the\r\ngod was hailed by his disciples as a promise that they too would\r\nissue triumphant from the corruption of the grave. On the morrow,\r\nthe twenty-fifth day of March, which was reckoned the vernal\r\nequinox, the divine resurrection was celebrated with a wild outburst\r\nof glee. At Rome, and probably elsewhere, the celebration took the\r\nform of a carnival. It was the Festival of Joy (_Hilaria_). A\r\nuniversal licence prevailed. Every man might say and do what he\r\npleased. People went about the streets in disguise. No dignity was\r\ntoo high or too sacred for the humblest citizen to assume with\r\nimpunity. In the reign of Commodus a band of conspirators thought to\r\ntake advantage of the masquerade by dressing in the uniform of the\r\nImperial Guard, and so, mingling with the crowd of merrymakers, to\r\nget within stabbing distance of the emperor. But the plot\r\nmiscarried. Even the stern Alexander Severus used to relax so far on\r\nthe joyous day as to admit a pheasant to his frugal board. The next\r\nday, the twenty-sixth of March, was given to repose, which must have\r\nbeen much needed after the varied excitements and fatigues of the\r\npreceding days. Finally, the Roman festival closed on the\r\ntwenty-seventh of March with a procession to the brook Almo. The\r\nsilver image of the goddess, with its face of jagged black stone,\r\nsat in a waggon drawn by oxen. Preceded by the nobles walking\r\nbarefoot, it moved slowly, to the loud music of pipes and\r\ntambourines, out by the Porta Capena, and so down to the banks of\r\nthe Almo, which flows into the Tiber just below the walls of Rome.\r\nThere the high-priest, robed in purple, washed the waggon, the\r\nimage, and the other sacred objects in the water of the stream. On\r\nreturning from their bath, the wain and the oxen were strewn with\r\nfresh spring flowers. All was mirth and gaiety. No one thought of\r\nthe blood that had flowed so lately. Even the eunuch priests forgot\r\ntheir wounds.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, appears to have been the annual solemnisation of the\r\ndeath and resurrection of Attis in spring. But besides these public\r\nrites, his worship is known to have comprised certain secret or\r\nmystic ceremonies, which probably aimed at bringing the worshipper,\r\nand especially the novice, into closer communication with his god.\r\nOur information as to the nature of these mysteries and the date of\r\ntheir celebration is unfortunately very scanty, but they seem to\r\nhave included a sacramental meal and a baptism of blood. In the\r\nsacrament the novice became a partaker of the mysteries by eating\r\nout of a drum and drinking out of a cymbal, two instruments of music\r\nwhich figured prominently in the thrilling orchestra of Attis. The\r\nfast which accompanied the mourning for the dead god may perhaps\r\nhave been designed to prepare the body of the communicant for the\r\nreception of the blessed sacrament by purging it of all that could\r\ndefile by contact the sacred elements. In the baptism the devotee,\r\ncrowned with gold and wreathed with fillets, descended into a pit,\r\nthe mouth of which was covered with a wooden grating. A bull,\r\nadorned with garlands of flowers, its forehead glittering with gold\r\nleaf, was then driven on to the grating and there stabbed to death\r\nwith a consecrated spear. Its hot reeking blood poured in torrents\r\nthrough the apertures, and was received with devout eagerness by the\r\nworshipper on every part of his person and garments, till he emerged\r\nfrom the pit, drenched, dripping, and scarlet from head to foot, to\r\nreceive the homage, nay the adoration, of his fellows as one who had\r\nbeen born again to eternal life and had washed away his sins in the\r\nblood of the bull. For some time afterwards the fiction of a new\r\nbirth was kept up by dieting him on milk like a new-born babe. The\r\nregeneration of the worshipper took place at the same time as the\r\nregeneration of his god, namely at the vernal equinox. At Rome the\r\nnew birth and the remission of sins by the shedding of bull\'s blood\r\nappear to have been carried out above all at the sanctuary of the\r\nPhrygian goddess on the Vatican Hill, at or near the spot where the\r\ngreat basilica of St. Peter\'s now stands; for many inscriptions\r\nrelating to the rites were found when the church was being enlarged\r\nin 1608 or 1609. From the Vatican as a centre this barbarous system\r\nof superstition seems to have spread to other parts of the Roman\r\nempire. Inscriptions found in Gaul and Germany prove that provincial\r\nsanctuaries modelled their ritual on that of the Vatican. From the\r\nsame source we learn that the testicles as well as the blood of the\r\nbull played an important part in the ceremonies. Probably they were\r\nregarded as a powerful charm to promote fertility and hasten the new\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV. Attis as a God of Vegetation\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGINAL character of Attis as a tree-spirit is brought out\r\nplainly by the part which the pine-tree plays in his legend, his\r\nritual, and his monuments. The story that he was a human being\r\ntransformed into a pine-tree is only one of those transparent\r\nattempts at rationalising old beliefs which meet us so frequently in\r\nmythology. The bringing in of the pine-tree from the woods, decked\r\nwith violets and woollen bands, is like bringing in the May-tree or\r\nSummer-tree in modern folk-custom; and the effigy which was attached\r\nto the pine-tree was only a duplicate representative of the\r\ntree-spirit Attis. After being fastened to the tree, the effigy was\r\nkept for a year and then burned. The same thing appears to have been\r\nsometimes done with the May-pole; and in like manner the effigy of\r\nthe corn-spirit, made at harvest, is often preserved till it is\r\nreplaced by a new effigy at next year\'s harvest. The original\r\nintention of such customs was no doubt to maintain the spirit of\r\nvegetation in life throughout the year. Why the Phrygians should\r\nhave worshipped the pine above other trees we can only guess.\r\nPerhaps the sight of its changeless, though sombre, green cresting\r\nthe ridges of the high hills above the fading splendour of the\r\nautumn woods in the valleys may have seemed to their eyes to mark it\r\nout as the seat of a diviner life, of something exempt from the sad\r\nvicissitudes of the seasons, constant and eternal as the sky which\r\nstooped to meet it. For the same reason, perhaps, ivy was sacred to\r\nAttis; at all events, we read that his eunuch priests were tattooed\r\nwith a pattern of ivy leaves. Another reason for the sanctity of the\r\npine may have been its usefulness. The cones of the stone-pine\r\ncontain edible nut-like seeds, which have been used as food since\r\nantiquity, and are still eaten, for example, by the poorer classes\r\nin Rome. Moreover, a wine was brewed from these seeds, and this may\r\npartly account for the orgiastic nature of the rites of Cybele,\r\nwhich the ancients compared to those of Dionysus. Further,\r\npine-cones were regarded as symbols or rather instruments of\r\nfertility. Hence at the festival of the Thesmophoria they were\r\nthrown, along with pigs and other agents or emblems of fecundity,\r\ninto the sacred vaults of Demeter for the purpose of quickening the\r\nground and the wombs of women.\r\n\r\nLike tree-spirits in general, Attis was apparently thought to wield\r\npower over the fruits of the earth or even to be identical with the\r\ncorn. One of his epithets was "very fruitful": he was addressed as\r\nthe "reaped green (or yellow) ear of corn"; and the story of his\r\nsufferings, death, and resurrection was interpreted as the ripe\r\ngrain wounded by the reaper, buried in the granary, and coming to\r\nlife again when it is sown in the ground. A statue of him in the\r\nLateran Museum at Rome clearly indicates his relation to the fruits\r\nof the earth, and particularly to the corn; for it represents him\r\nwith a bunch of ears of corn and fruit in his hand, and a wreath of\r\npine-cones, pomegranates, and other fruits on his head, while from\r\nthe top of his Phrygian cap ears of corn are sprouting. On a stone\r\nurn, which contained the ashes of an Archigallus or high-priest of\r\nAttis, the same idea is expressed in a slightly different way. The\r\ntop of the urn is adorned with ears of corn carved in relief, and it\r\nis surmounted by the figure of a cock, whose tail consists of ears\r\nof corn. Cybele in like manner was conceived as a goddess of\r\nfertility who could make or mar the fruits of the earth; for the\r\npeople of Augustodunum (Autun) in Gaul used to cart her image about\r\nin a waggon for the good of the fields and vineyards, while they\r\ndanced and sang before it, and we have seen that in Italy an\r\nunusually fine harvest was attributed to the recent arrival of the\r\nGreat Mother. The bathing of the image of the goddess in a river may\r\nwell have been a rain-charm to ensure an abundant supply of moisture\r\nfor the crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI. Human Representatives of Attis\r\n\r\nFROM INSCRIPTIONS it appears that both at Pessinus and Rome the\r\nhigh-priest of Cybele regularly bore the name of Attis. It is\r\ntherefore a reasonable conjecture that he played the part of his\r\nnamesake, the legendary Attis, at the annual festival. We have seen\r\nthat on the Day of Blood he drew blood from his arms, and this may\r\nhave been an imitation of the self-inflicted death of Attis under\r\nthe pine-tree. It is not inconsistent with this supposition that\r\nAttis was also represented at these ceremonies by an effigy; for\r\ninstances can be shown in which the divine being is first\r\nrepresented by a living person and afterwards by an effigy, which is\r\nthen burned or otherwise destroyed. Perhaps we may go a step farther\r\nand conjecture that this mimic killing of the priest, accompanied by\r\na real effusion of his blood, was in Phrygia, as it has been\r\nelsewhere, a substitute for a human sacrifice which in earlier times\r\nwas actually offered.\r\n\r\nA reminiscence of the manner in which these old representatives of\r\nthe deity were put to death is perhaps preserved in the famous story\r\nof Marsyas. He was said to be a Phrygian satyr or Silenus, according\r\nto others a shepherd or herdsman, who played sweetly on the flute. A\r\nfriend of Cybele, he roamed the country with the disconsolate\r\ngoddess to soothe her grief for the death of Attis. The composition\r\nof the Mother\'s Air, a tune played on the flute in honour of the\r\nGreat Mother Goddess, was attributed to him by the people of\r\nCelaenae in Phrygia. Vain of his skill, he challenged Apollo to a\r\nmusical contest, he to play on the flute and Apollo on the lyre.\r\nBeing vanquished, Marsyas was tied up to a pine-tree and flayed or\r\ncut limb from limb either by the victorious Apollo or by a Scythian\r\nslave. His skin was shown at Celaenae in historical times. It hung\r\nat the foot of the citadel in a cave from which the river Marsyas\r\nrushed with an impetuous and noisy tide to join the Maeander. So the\r\nAdonis bursts full-born from the precipices of the Lebanon; so the\r\nblue river of Ibreez leaps in a crystal jet from the red rocks of\r\nthe Taurus; so the stream, which now rumbles deep underground, used\r\nto gleam for a moment on its passage from darkness to darkness in\r\nthe dim light of the Corycian cave. In all these copious fountains,\r\nwith their glad promise of fertility and life, men of old saw the\r\nhand of God and worshipped him beside the rushing river with the\r\nmusic of its tumbling waters in their ears. At Celaenae, if we can\r\ntrust tradition, the piper Marsyas, hanging in his cave, had a soul\r\nfor harmony even in death; for it is said that at the sound of his\r\nnative Phrygian melodies the skin of the dead satyr used to thrill,\r\nbut that if the musician struck up an air in praise of Apollo it\r\nremained deaf and motionless.\r\n\r\nIn this Phrygian satyr, shepherd, or herdsman who enjoyed the\r\nfriendship of Cybele, practised the music so characteristic of her\r\nrites, and died a violent death on her sacred tree, the pine, may we\r\nnot detect a close resemblance to Attis, the favourite shepherd or\r\nherdsman of the goddess, who is himself described as a piper, is\r\nsaid to have perished under a pine-tree, and was annually\r\nrepresented by an effigy hung, like Marsyas, upon a pine? We may\r\nconjecture that in old days the priest who bore the name and played\r\nthe part of Attis at the spring festival of Cybele was regularly\r\nhanged or otherwise slain upon the sacred tree, and that this\r\nbarbarous custom was afterwards mitigated into the form in which it\r\nis known to us in later times, when the priest merely drew blood\r\nfrom his body under the tree and attached an effigy instead of\r\nhimself to its trunk. In the holy grove at Upsala men and animals\r\nwere sacrificed by being hanged upon the sacred trees. The human\r\nvictims dedicated to Odin were regularly put to death by hanging or\r\nby a combination of hanging and stabbing, the man being strung up to\r\na tree or a gallows and then wounded with a spear. Hence Odin was\r\ncalled the Lord of the Gallows or the God of the Hanged, and he is\r\nrepresented sitting under a gallows tree. Indeed he is said to have\r\nbeen sacrificed to himself in the ordinary way, as we learn from the\r\nweird verses of the _Havamal,_ in which the god describes how he\r\nacquired his divine power by learning the magic runes:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "I know that I hung on the windy tree\r\n    For nine whole nights,\r\n    Wounded with the spear, dedicated to Odin,\r\n    Myself to myself."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bagobos of Mindanao, one of the Philippine Islands, used\r\nannually to sacrifice human victims for the good of the crops in a\r\nsimilar way. Early in December, when the constellation Orion\r\nappeared at seven o\'clock in the evening, the people knew that the\r\ntime had come to clear their fields for sowing and to sacrifice a\r\nslave. The sacrifice was presented to certain powerful spirits as\r\npayment for the good year which the people had enjoyed, and to\r\nensure the favour of the spirits for the coming season. The victim\r\nwas led to a great tree in the forest; there he was tied with his\r\nback to the tree and his arms stretched high above his head, in the\r\nattitude in which ancient artists portrayed Marsyas hanging on the\r\nfatal tree. While he thus hung by the arms, he was slain by a spear\r\nthrust through his body at the level of the armpits. Afterwards the\r\nbody was cut clean through the middle at the waist, and the upper\r\npart was apparently allowed to dangle for a little from the tree,\r\nwhile the under part wallowed in blood on the ground. The two\r\nportions were finally cast into a shallow trench beside the tree.\r\nBefore this was done, anybody who wished might cut off a piece of\r\nflesh or a lock of hair from the corpse and carry it to the grave of\r\nsome relation whose body was being consumed by a ghoul. Attracted by\r\nthe fresh corpse, the ghoul would leave the mouldering old body in\r\npeace. These sacrifices have been offered by men now living.\r\n\r\nIn Greece the great goddess Artemis herself appears to have been\r\nannually hanged in effigy in her sacred grove of Condylea among the\r\nArcadian hills, and there accordingly she went by the name of the\r\nHanged One. Indeed a trace of a similar rite may perhaps be detected\r\neven at Ephesus, the most famous of her sanctuaries, in the legend\r\nof a woman who hanged herself and was thereupon dressed by the\r\ncompassionate goddess in her own divine garb and called by the name\r\nof Hecate. Similarly, at Melite in Phthia, a story was told of a\r\ngirl named Aspalis who hanged herself, but who appears to have been\r\nmerely a form of Artemis. For after her death her body could not be\r\nfound, but an image of her was discovered standing beside the image\r\nof Artemis, and the people bestowed on it the title of Hecaerge or\r\nFar-shooter, one of the regular epithets of the goddess. Every year\r\nthe virgins sacrificed a young goat to the image by hanging it,\r\nbecause Aspalis was said to have hanged herself. The sacrifice may\r\nhave been a substitute for hanging an image or a human\r\nrepresentative of Artemis. Again, in Rhodes the fair Helen was\r\nworshipped under the title of Helen of the Tree, because the queen\r\nof the island had caused her handmaids, disguised as Furies, to\r\nstring her up to a bough. That the Asiatic Greeks sacrificed animals\r\nin this fashion is proved by coins of Ilium, which represent an ox\r\nor cow hanging on a tree and stabbed with a knife by a man, who sits\r\namong the branches or on the animal\'s back. At Hierapolis also the\r\nvictims were hung on trees before they were burnt. With these Greek\r\nand Scandinavian parallels before us we can hardly dismiss as wholly\r\nimprobable the conjecture that in Phrygia a man-god may have hung\r\nyear by year on the sacred but fatal tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII. Oriental Religions in the West\r\n\r\nTHE WORSHIP of the Great Mother of the Gods and her lover or son was\r\nvery popular under the Roman Empire. Inscriptions prove that the two\r\nreceived divine honours, separately or conjointly, not only in\r\nItaly, and especially at Rome, but also in the provinces,\r\nparticularly in Africa, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, and\r\nBulgaria. Their worship survived the establishment of Christianity\r\nby Constantine; for Symmachus records the recurrence of the festival\r\nof the Great Mother, and in the days of Augustine her effeminate\r\npriests still paraded the streets and squares of Carthage with\r\nwhitened faces, scented hair, and mincing gait, while, like the\r\nmendicant friars of the Middle Ages, they begged alms from the\r\npassers-by. In Greece, on the other hand, the bloody orgies of the\r\nAsiatic goddess and her consort appear to have found little favour.\r\nThe barbarous and cruel character of the worship, with its frantic\r\nexcesses, was doubtless repugnant to the good taste and humanity of\r\nthe Greeks, who seem to have preferred the kindred but gentler rites\r\nof Adonis. Yet the same features which shocked and repelled the\r\nGreeks may have positively attracted the less refined Romans and\r\nbarbarians of the West. The ecstatic frenzies, which were mistaken\r\nfor divine inspiration, the mangling of the body, the theory of a\r\nnew birth and the remission of sins through the shedding of blood,\r\nhave all their origin in savagery, and they naturally appealed to\r\npeoples in whom the savage instincts were still strong. Their true\r\ncharacter was indeed often disguised under a decent veil of\r\nallegorical or philosophical interpretation, which probably sufficed\r\nto impose upon the rapt and enthusiastic worshippers, reconciling\r\neven the more cultivated of them to things which otherwise must have\r\nfilled them with horror and disgust.\r\n\r\nThe religion of the Great Mother, with its curious blending of crude\r\nsavagery with spiritual aspirations, was only one of a multitude of\r\nsimilar Oriental faiths which in the later days of paganism spread\r\nover the Roman Empire, and by saturating the European peoples with\r\nalien ideals of life gradually undermined the whole fabric of\r\nancient civilisation. Greek and Roman society was built on the\r\nconception of the subordination of the individual to the community,\r\nof the citizen to the state; it set the safety of the commonwealth,\r\nas the supreme aim of conduct, above the safety of the individual\r\nwhether in this world or in the world to come. Trained from infancy\r\nin this unselfish ideal, the citizens devoted their lives to the\r\npublic service and were ready to lay them down for the common good;\r\nor if they shrank from the supreme sacrifice, it never occurred to\r\nthem that they acted otherwise than basely in preferring their\r\npersonal existence to the interests of their country. All this was\r\nchanged by the spread of Oriental religions which inculcated the\r\ncommunion of the soul with God and its eternal salvation as the only\r\nobjects worth living for, objects in comparison with which the\r\nprosperity and even the existence of the state sank into\r\ninsignificance. The inevitable result of this selfish and immoral\r\ndoctrine was to withdraw the devotee more and more from the public\r\nservice, to concentrate his thoughts on his own spiritual emotions,\r\nand to breed in him a contempt for the present life which he\r\nregarded merely as a probation for a better and an eternal. The\r\nsaint and the recluse, disdainful of earth and rapt in ecstatic\r\ncontemplation of heaven, became in popular opinion the highest ideal\r\nof humanity, displacing the old ideal of the patriot and hero who,\r\nforgetful of self, lives and is ready to die for the good of his\r\ncountry. The earthly city seemed poor and contemptible to men whose\r\neyes beheld the City of God coming in the clouds of heaven. Thus the\r\ncentre of gravity, so to say, was shifted from the present to a\r\nfuture life, and however much the other world may have gained, there\r\ncan be little doubt that this one lost heavily by the change. A\r\ngeneral disintegration of the body politic set in. The ties of the\r\nstate and the family were loosened: the structure of society tended\r\nto resolve itself into its individual elements and thereby to\r\nrelapse into barbarism; for civilisation is only possible through\r\nthe active co-operation of the citizens and their willingness to\r\nsubordinate their private interests to the common good. Men refused\r\nto defend their country and even to continue their kind. In their\r\nanxiety to save their own souls and the souls of others, they were\r\ncontent to leave the material world, which they identified with the\r\nprinciple of evil, to perish around them. This obsession lasted for\r\na thousand years. The revival of Roman law, of the Aristotelian\r\nphilosophy, of ancient art and literature at the close of the Middle\r\nAges, marked the return of Europe to native ideals of life and\r\nconduct, to saner, manlier views of the world. The long halt in the\r\nmarch of civilisation was over. The tide of Oriental invasion had\r\nturned at last. It is ebbing still.\r\n\r\nAmong the gods of eastern origin who in the decline of the ancient\r\nworld competed against each other for the allegiance of the West was\r\nthe old Persian deity Mithra. The immense popularity of his worship\r\nis attested by the monuments illustrative of it which have been\r\nfound scattered in profusion all over the Roman Empire. In respect\r\nboth of doctrines and of rites the cult of Mithra appears to have\r\npresented many points of resemblance not only to the religion of the\r\nMother of the Gods but also to Christianity. The similarity struck\r\nthe Christian doctors themselves and was explained by them as a work\r\nof the devil, who sought to seduce the souls of men from the true\r\nfaith by a false and insidious imitation of it. So to the Spanish\r\nconquerors of Mexico and Peru many of the native heathen rites\r\nappeared to be diabolical counterfeits of the Christian sacraments.\r\nWith more probability the modern student of comparative religion\r\ntraces such resemblances to the similar and independent workings of\r\nthe mind of man in his sincere, if crude, attempts to fathom the\r\nsecret of the universe, and to adjust his little life to its awful\r\nmysteries. However that may be, there can be no doubt that the\r\nMithraic religion proved a formidable rival to Christianity,\r\ncombining as it did a solemn ritual with aspirations after moral\r\npurity and a hope of immortality. Indeed the issue of the conflict\r\nbetween the two faiths appears for a time to have hung in the\r\nbalance. An instructive relic of the long struggle is preserved in\r\nour festival of Christmas, which the Church seems to have borrowed\r\ndirectly from its heathen rival. In the Julian calendar the\r\ntwenty-fifth of December was reckoned the winter solstice, and it\r\nwas regarded as the Nativity of the Sun, because the day begins to\r\nlengthen and the power of the sun to increase from that\r\nturning-point of the year. The ritual of the nativity, as it appears\r\nto have been celebrated in Syria and Egypt, was remarkable. The\r\ncelebrants retired into certain inner shrines, from which at\r\nmidnight they issued with a loud cry, "The Virgin has brought forth!\r\nThe light is waxing!" The Egyptians even represented the new-born\r\nsun by the image of an infant which on his birthday, the winter\r\nsolstice, they brought forth and exhibited to his worshippers. No\r\ndoubt the Virgin who thus conceived and bore a son on the\r\ntwenty-fifth of December was the great Oriental goddess whom the\r\nSemites called the Heavenly Virgin or simply the Heavenly Goddess;\r\nin Semitic lands she was a form of Astarte. Now Mithra was regularly\r\nidentified by his worshippers with the Sun, the Unconquered Sun, as\r\nthey called him; hence his nativity also fell on the twenty-fifth of\r\nDecember. The Gospels say nothing as to the day of Christ\'s birth,\r\nand accordingly the early Church did not celebrate it. In time,\r\nhowever, the Christians of Egypt came to regard the sixth of January\r\nas the date of the Nativity, and the custom of commemorating the\r\nbirth of the Saviour on that day gradually spread until by the\r\nfourth century it was universally established in the East. But at\r\nthe end of the third or the beginning of the fourth century the\r\nWestern Church, which had never recognised the sixth of January as\r\nthe day of the Nativity, adopted the twenty-fifth of December as the\r\ntrue date, and in time its decision was accepted also by the Eastern\r\nChurch. At Antioch the change was not introduced till about the year\r\n375 A.D.\r\n\r\nWhat considerations led the ecclesiastical authorities to institute\r\nthe festival of Christmas? The motives for the innovation are stated\r\nwith great frankness by a Syrian writer, himself a Christian. "The\r\nreason," he tells us, "why the fathers transferred the celebration\r\nof the sixth of January to the twenty-fifth of December was this. It\r\nwas a custom of the heathen to celebrate on the same twenty-fifth of\r\nDecember the birthday of the Sun, at which they kindled lights in\r\ntoken of festivity. In these solemnities and festivities the\r\nChristians also took part. Accordingly when the doctors of the\r\nChurch perceived that the Christians had a leaning to this festival,\r\nthey took counsel and resolved that the true Nativity should be\r\nsolemnised on that day and the festival of the Epiphany on the sixth\r\nof January. Accordingly, along with this custom, the practice has\r\nprevailed of kindling fires till the sixth." The heathen origin of\r\nChristmas is plainly hinted at, if not tacitly admitted, by\r\nAugustine when he exhorts his Christian brethren not to celebrate\r\nthat solemn day like the heathen on account of the sun, but on\r\naccount of him who made the sun. In like manner Leo the Great\r\nrebuked the pestilent belief that Christmas was solemnised because\r\nof the birth of the new sun, as it was called, and not because of\r\nthe nativity of Christ.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that the Christian Church chose to celebrate the\r\nbirthday of its Founder on the twenty-fifth of December in order to\r\ntransfer the devotion of the heathen from the Sun to him who was\r\ncalled the Sun of Righteousness. If that was so, there can be no\r\nintrinsic improbability in the conjecture that motives of the same\r\nsort may have led the ecclesiastical authorities to assimilate the\r\nEaster festival of the death and resurrection of their Lord to the\r\nfestival of the death and resurrection of another Asiatic god which\r\nfell at the same season. Now the Easter rites still observed in\r\nGreece, Sicily, and Southern Italy bear in some respects a striking\r\nresemblance to the rites of Adonis, and I have suggested that the\r\nChurch may have consciously adapted the new festival to its heathen\r\npredecessor for the sake of winning souls to Christ. But this\r\nadaptation probably took place in the Greek-speaking rather than in\r\nthe Latin-speaking parts of the ancient world; for the worship of\r\nAdonis, while it flourished among the Greeks, appears to have made\r\nlittle impression on Rome and the West. Certainly it never formed\r\npart of the official Roman religion. The place which it might have\r\ntaken in the affections of the vulgar was already occupied by the\r\nsimilar but more barbarous worship of Attis and the Great Mother.\r\nNow the death and resurrection of Attis were officially celebrated\r\nat Rome on the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth of March, the latter\r\nbeing regarded as the spring equinox, and therefore as the most\r\nappropriate day for the revival of a god of vegetation who had been\r\ndead or sleeping throughout the winter. But according to an ancient\r\nand widespread tradition Christ suffered on the twenty-fifth of\r\nMarch, and accordingly some Christians regularly celebrated the\r\nCrucifixion on that day without any regard to the state of the moon.\r\nThis custom was certainly observed in Phrygia, Cappadocia, and Gaul,\r\nand there seem to be grounds for thinking that at one time it was\r\nfollowed also in Rome. Thus the tradition which placed the death of\r\nChrist on the twenty-fifth of March was ancient and deeply rooted.\r\nIt is all the more remarkable because astronomical considerations\r\nprove that it can have had no historical foundation. The inference\r\nappears to be inevitable that the passion of Christ must have been\r\narbitrarily referred to that date in order to harmonise with an\r\nolder festival of the spring equinox. This is the view of the\r\nlearned ecclesiastical historian Mgr. Duchesne, who points out that\r\nthe death of the Saviour was thus made to fall upon the very day on\r\nwhich, according to a widespread belief, the world had been created.\r\nBut the resurrection of Attis, who combined in himself the\r\ncharacters of the divine Father and the divine Son, was officially\r\ncelebrated at Rome on the same day. When we remember that the\r\nfestival of St. George in April has replaced the ancient pagan\r\nfestival of the Parilia; that the festival of St. John the Baptist\r\nin June has succeeded to a heathen midsummer festival of water: that\r\nthe festival of the Assumption of the Virgin in August has ousted\r\nthe festival of Diana; that the feast of All Souls in November is a\r\ncontinuation of an old heathen feast of the dead; and that the\r\nNativity of Christ himself was assigned to the winter solstice in\r\nDecember because that day was deemed the Nativity of the Sun; we can\r\nhardly be thought rash or unreasonable in conjecturing that the\r\nother cardinal festival of the Christian church--the solemnisation\r\nof Easter--may have been in like manner, and from like motives of\r\nedification, adapted to a similar celebration of the Phrygian god\r\nAttis at the vernal equinox.\r\n\r\nAt least it is a remarkable coincidence, if it is nothing more, that\r\nthe Christian and the heathen festivals of the divine death and\r\nresurrection should have been solemnised at the same season and in\r\nthe same places. For the places which celebrated the death of Christ\r\nat the spring equinox were Phrygia, Gaul, and apparently Rome, that\r\nis, the very regions in which the worship of Attis either originated\r\nor struck deepest root. It is difficult to regard the coincidence as\r\npurely accidental. If the vernal equinox, the season at which in the\r\ntemperate regions the whole face of nature testifies to a fresh\r\noutburst of vital energy, had been viewed from of old as the time\r\nwhen the world was annually created afresh in the resurrection of a\r\ngod, nothing could be more natural than to place the resurrection of\r\nthe new deity at the same cardinal point of the year. Only it is to\r\nbe observed that if the death of Christ was dated on the\r\ntwenty-fifth of March, his resurrection, according to Christian\r\ntradition, must have happened on the twenty-seventh of March, which\r\nis just two days later than the vernal equinox of the Julian\r\ncalendar and the resurrection of Attis. A similar displacement of\r\ntwo days in the adjustment of Christian to heathen celebrations\r\noccurs in the festivals of St. George and the Assumption of the\r\nVirgin. However, another Christian tradition, followed by Lactantius\r\nand perhaps by the practice of the Church in Gaul, placed the death\r\nof Christ on the twenty-third and his resurrection on the\r\ntwenty-fifth of March. If that was so, his resurrection coincided\r\nexactly with the resurrection of Attis.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact it appears from the testimony of an anonymous\r\nChristian, who wrote in the fourth century of our era, that\r\nChristians and pagans alike were struck by the remarkable\r\ncoincidence between the death and resurrection of their respective\r\ndeities, and that the coincidence formed a theme of bitter\r\ncontroversy between the adherents of the rival religions, the pagans\r\ncontending that the resurrection of Christ was a spurious imitation\r\nof the resurrection of Attis, and the Christians asserting with\r\nequal warmth that the resurrection of Attis was a diabolical\r\ncounterfeit of the resurrection of Christ. In these unseemly\r\nbickerings the heathen took what to a superficial observer might\r\nseem strong ground by arguing that their god was the older and\r\ntherefore presumably the original, not the counterfeit, since as a\r\ngeneral rule an original is older than its copy. This feeble\r\nargument the Christians easily rebutted. They admitted, indeed, that\r\nin point of time Christ was the junior deity, but they triumphantly\r\ndemonstrated his real seniority by falling back on the subtlety of\r\nSatan, who on so important an occasion had surpassed himself by\r\ninverting the usual order of nature.\r\n\r\nTaken altogether, the coincidences of the Christian with the heathen\r\nfestivals are too close and too numerous to be accidental. They mark\r\nthe compromise which the Church in the hour of its triumph was\r\ncompelled to make with its vanquished yet still dangerous rivals.\r\nThe inflexible Protestantism of the primitive missionaries, with\r\ntheir fiery denunciations of heathendom, had been exchanged for the\r\nsupple policy, the easy tolerance, the comprehensive charity of\r\nshrewd ecclesiastics, who clearly perceived that if Christianity was\r\nto conquer the world it could do so only by relaxing the too rigid\r\nprinciples of its Founder, by widening a little the narrow gate\r\nwhich leads to salvation. In this respect an instructive parallel\r\nmight be drawn between the history of Christianity and the history\r\nof Buddhism. Both systems were in their origin essentially ethical\r\nreforms born of the generous ardour, the lofty aspirations, the\r\ntender compassion of their noble Founders, two of those beautiful\r\nspirits who appear at rare intervals on earth like beings come from\r\na better world to support and guide our weak and erring nature. Both\r\npreached moral virtue as the means of accomplishing what they\r\nregarded as the supreme object of life, the eternal salvation of the\r\nindividual soul, though by a curious antithesis the one sought that\r\nsalvation in a blissful eternity, the other in a final release from\r\nsuffering, in annihilation. But the austere ideals of sanctity which\r\nthey inculcated were too deeply opposed not only to the frailties\r\nbut to the natural instincts of humanity ever to be carried out in\r\npractice by more than a small number of disciples, who consistently\r\nrenounced the ties of the family and the state in order to work out\r\ntheir own salvation in the still seclusion of the cloister. If such\r\nfaiths were to be nominally accepted by whole nations or even by the\r\nworld, it was essential that they should first be modified or\r\ntransformed so as to accord in some measure with the prejudices, the\r\npassions, the superstitions of the vulgar. This process of\r\naccommodation was carried out in after ages by followers who, made\r\nof less ethereal stuff than their masters, were for that reason the\r\nbetter fitted to mediate between them and the common herd. Thus as\r\ntime went on, the two religions, in exact proportion to their\r\ngrowing popularity, absorbed more and more of those baser elements\r\nwhich they had been instituted for the very purpose of suppressing.\r\nSuch spiritual decadences are inevitable. The world cannot live at\r\nthe level of its great men. Yet it would be unfair to the generality\r\nof our kind to ascribe wholly to their intellectual and moral\r\nweakness the gradual divergence of Buddhism and Christianity from\r\ntheir primitive patterns. For it should never be forgotten that by\r\ntheir glorification of poverty and celibacy both these religions\r\nstruck straight at the root not merely of civil society but of human\r\nexistence. The blow was parried by the wisdom or the folly of the\r\nvast majority of mankind, who refused to purchase a chance of saving\r\ntheir souls with the certainty of extinguishing the species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. The Myth of Osiris\r\n\r\nIN ANCIENT EGYPT the god whose death and resurrection were annually\r\ncelebrated with alternate sorrow and joy was Osiris, the most\r\npopular of all Egyptian deities; and there are good grounds for\r\nclassing him in one of his aspects with Adonis and Attis as a\r\npersonification of the great yearly vicissitudes of nature,\r\nespecially of the corn. But the immense vogue which he enjoyed for\r\nmany ages induced his devoted worshippers to heap upon him the\r\nattributes and powers of many other gods; so that it is not always\r\neasy to strip him, so to say, of his borrowed plumes and to restore\r\nthem to their proper owners.\r\n\r\nThe story of Osiris is told in a connected form only by Plutarch,\r\nwhose narrative has been confirmed and to some extent amplified in\r\nmodern times by the evidence of the monuments.\r\n\r\nOsiris was the offspring of an intrigue between the earth-god Seb\r\n(Keb or Geb, as the name is sometimes transliterated) and the\r\nsky-goddess Nut. The Greeks identified his parents with their own\r\ndeities Cronus and Rhea. When the sun-god Ra perceived that his wife\r\nNut had been unfaithful to him, he declared with a curse that she\r\nshould be delivered of the child in no month and no year. But the\r\ngoddess had another lover, the god Thoth or Hermes, as the Greeks\r\ncalled him, and he playing at draughts with the moon won from her a\r\nseventy-second part of every day, and having compounded five whole\r\ndays out of these parts he added them to the Egyptian year of three\r\nhundred and sixty days. This was the mythical origin of the five\r\nsupplementary days which the Egyptians annually inserted at the end\r\nof every year in order to establish a harmony between lunar and\r\nsolar time. On these five days, regarded as outside the year of\r\ntwelve months, the curse of the sun-god did not rest, and\r\naccordingly Osiris was born on the first of them. At his nativity a\r\nvoice rang out proclaiming that the Lord of All had come into the\r\nworld. Some say that a certain Pamyles heard a voice from the temple\r\nat Thebes bidding him announce with a shout that a great king, the\r\nbeneficent Osiris, was born. But Osiris was not the only child of\r\nhis mother. On the second of the supplementary days she gave birth\r\nto the elder Horus, on the third to the god Set, whom the Greeks\r\ncalled Typhon, on the fourth to the goddess Isis, and on the fifth\r\nto the goddess Nephthys. Afterwards Set married his sister Nephthys,\r\nand Osiris married his sister Isis.\r\n\r\nReigning as a king on earth, Osiris reclaimed the Egyptians from\r\nsavagery, gave them laws, and taught them to worship the gods.\r\nBefore his time the Egyptians had been cannibals. But Isis, the\r\nsister and wife of Osiris, discovered wheat and barley growing wild,\r\nand Osiris introduced the cultivation of these grains amongst his\r\npeople, who forthwith abandoned cannibalism and took kindly to a\r\ncorn diet. Moreover, Osiris is said to have been the first to gather\r\nfruit from trees, to train the vine to poles, and to tread the\r\ngrapes. Eager to communicate these beneficent discoveries to all\r\nmankind, he committed the whole government of Egypt to his wife\r\nIsis, and travelled over the world, diffusing the blessings of\r\ncivilisation and agriculture wherever he went. In countries where a\r\nharsh climate or niggardly soil forbade the cultivation of the vine,\r\nhe taught the inhabitants to console themselves for the want of wine\r\nby brewing beer from barley. Loaded with the wealth that had been\r\nshowered upon him by grateful nations, he returned to Egypt, and on\r\naccount of the benefits he had conferred on mankind he was\r\nunanimously hailed and worshipped as a deity. But his brother Set\r\n(whom the Greeks called Typhon) with seventy-two others plotted\r\nagainst him. Having taken the measure of his good brother\'s body by\r\nstealth, the bad brother Typhon fashioned and highly decorated a\r\ncoffer of the same size, and once when they were all drinking and\r\nmaking merry he brought in the coffer and jestingly promised to give\r\nit to the one whom it should fit exactly. Well, they all tried one\r\nafter the other, but it fitted none of them. Last of all Osiris\r\nstepped into it and lay down. On that the conspirators ran and\r\nslammed the lid down on him, nailed it fast, soldered it with molten\r\nlead, and flung the coffer into the Nile. This happened on the\r\nseventeenth day of the month Athyr, when the sun is in the sign of\r\nthe Scorpion, and in the eight-and-twentieth year of the reign or\r\nthe life of Osiris. When Isis heard of it she sheared off a lock of\r\nher hair, put on a mourning attire, and wandered disconsolately up\r\nand down, seeking the body.\r\n\r\nBy the advice of the god of wisdom she took refuge in the papyrus\r\nswamps of the Delta. Seven scorpions accompanied her in her flight.\r\nOne evening when she was weary she came to the house of a woman,\r\nwho, alarmed at the sight of the scorpions, shut the door in her\r\nface. Then one of the scorpions crept under the door and stung the\r\nchild of the woman that he died. But when Isis heard the mother\'s\r\nlamentation, her heart was touched, and she laid her hands on the\r\nchild and uttered her powerful spells; so the poison was driven out\r\nof the child and he lived. Afterwards Isis herself gave birth to a\r\nson in the swamps. She had conceived him while she fluttered in the\r\nform of a hawk over the corpse of her dead husband. The infant was\r\nthe younger Horus, who in his youth bore the name of Harpocrates,\r\nthat is, the child Horus. Him Buto, the goddess of the north, hid\r\nfrom the wrath of his wicked uncle Set. Yet she could not guard him\r\nfrom all mishap; for one day when Isis came to her little son\'s\r\nhiding-place she found him stretched lifeless and rigid on the\r\nground: a scorpion had stung him. Then Isis prayed to the sun-god Ra\r\nfor help. The god hearkened to her and staid his bark in the sky,\r\nand sent down Thoth to teach her the spell by which she might\r\nrestore her son to life. She uttered the words of power, and\r\nstraightway the poison flowed from the body of Horus, air passed\r\ninto him, and he lived. Then Thoth ascended up into the sky and took\r\nhis place once more in the bark of the sun, and the bright pomp\r\npassed onward jubilant.\r\n\r\nMeantime the coffer containing the body of Osiris had floated down\r\nthe river and away out to sea, till at last it drifted ashore at\r\nByblus, on the coast of Syria. Here a fine _erica_-tree shot up\r\nsuddenly and enclosed the chest in its trunk. The king of the\r\ncountry, admiring the growth of the tree, had it cut down and made\r\ninto a pillar of his house; but he did not know that the coffer with\r\nthe dead Osiris was in it. Word of this came to Isis and she\r\njourneyed to Byblus, and sat down by the well, in humble guise, her\r\nface wet with tears. To none would she speak till the king\'s\r\nhandmaidens came, and them she greeted kindly, and braided their\r\nhair, and breathed on them from her own divine body a wondrous\r\nperfume. But when the queen beheld the braids of her handmaidens\'\r\nhair and smelt the sweet smell that emanated from them, she sent for\r\nthe stranger woman and took her into her house and made her the\r\nnurse of her child. But Isis gave the babe her finger instead of her\r\nbreast to suck, and at night she began to burn all that was mortal\r\nof him away, while she herself in the likeness of a swallow\r\nfluttered round the pillar that contained her dead brother,\r\ntwittering mournfully. But the queen spied what she was doing and\r\nshrieked out when she saw her child in flames, and thereby she\r\nhindered him from becoming immortal. Then the goddess revealed\r\nherself and begged for the pillar of the roof, and they gave it her,\r\nand she cut the coffer out of it, and fell upon it and embraced it\r\nand lamented so loud that the younger of the king\'s children died of\r\nfright on the spot. But the trunk of the tree she wrapped in fine\r\nlinen, and poured ointment on it, and gave it to the king and queen,\r\nand the wood stands in a temple of Isis and is worshipped by the\r\npeople of Byblus to this day. And Isis put the coffer in a boat and\r\ntook the eldest of the king\'s children with her and sailed away. As\r\nsoon as they were alone, she opened the chest, and laying her face\r\non the face of her brother she kissed him and wept. But the child\r\ncame behind her softly and saw what she was about, and she turned\r\nand looked at him in anger, and the child could not bear her look\r\nand died; but some say that it was not so, but that he fell into the\r\nsea and was drowned. It is he whom the Egyptians sing of at their\r\nbanquets under the name of Maneros.\r\n\r\nBut Isis put the coffer by and went to see her son Horus at the city\r\nof Buto, and Typhon found the coffer as he was hunting a boar one\r\nnight by the light of a full moon. And he knew the body, and rent it\r\ninto fourteen pieces, and scattered them abroad. But Isis sailed up\r\nand down the marshes in a shallop made of papyrus, looking for the\r\npieces; and that is why when people sail in shallops made of\r\npapyrus, the crocodiles do not hurt them, for they fear or respect\r\nthe goddess. And that is the reason, too, why there are many graves\r\nof Osiris in Egypt, for she buried each limb as she found it. But\r\nothers will have it that she buried an image of him in every city,\r\npretending it was his body, in order that Osiris might be worshipped\r\nin many places, and that if Typhon searched for the real grave he\r\nmight not be able to find it. However, the genital member of Osiris\r\nhad been eaten by the fishes, so Isis made an image of it instead,\r\nand the image is used by the Egyptians at their festivals to this\r\nday. "Isis," writes the historian Diodorus Siculus, "recovered all\r\nthe parts of the body except the genitals; and because she wished\r\nthat her husband\'s grave should be unknown and honoured by all who\r\ndwell in the land of Egypt, she resorted to the following device.\r\nShe moulded human images out of wax and spices, corresponding to the\r\nstature of Osiris, round each one of the parts of his body. Then she\r\ncalled in the priests according to their families and took an oath\r\nof them all that they would reveal to no man the trust she was about\r\nto repose in them. So to each of them privately she said that to\r\nthem alone she entrusted the burial of the body, and reminding them\r\nof the benefits they had received she exhorted them to bury the body\r\nin their own land and to honour Osiris as a god. She also besought\r\nthem to dedicate one of the animals of their country, whichever they\r\nchose, and to honour it in life as they had formerly honoured\r\nOsiris, and when it died to grant it obsequies like his. And because\r\nshe would encourage the priests in their own interest to bestow the\r\naforesaid honours, she gave them a third part of the land to be used\r\nby them in the service and worship of the gods. Accordingly it is\r\nsaid that the priests, mindful of the benefits of Osiris, desirous\r\nof gratifying the queen, and moved by the prospect of gain, carried\r\nout all the injunctions of Isis. Wherefore to this day each of the\r\npriests imagines that Osiris is buried in his country, and they\r\nhonour the beasts that were consecrated in the beginning, and when\r\nthe animals die the priests renew at their burial the mourning for\r\nOsiris. But the sacred bulls, the one called Apis and the other\r\nMnevis, were dedicated to Osiris, and it was ordained that they\r\nshould be worshipped as gods in common by all the Egyptians, since\r\nthese animals above all others had helped the discoverers of corn in\r\nsowing the seed and procuring the universal benefits of\r\nagriculture."\r\n\r\nSuch is the myth or legend of Osiris, as told by Greek writers and\r\neked out by more or less fragmentary notices or allusions in native\r\nEgyptian literature. A long inscription in the temple at Denderah\r\nhas preserved a list of the god\'s graves, and other texts mention\r\nthe parts of his body which were treasured as holy relics in each of\r\nthe sanctuaries. Thus his heart was at Athribis, his backbone at\r\nBusiris, his neck at Letopolis, and his head at Memphis. As often\r\nhappens in such cases, some of his divine limbs were miraculously\r\nmultiplied. His head, for example, was at Abydos as well as at\r\nMemphis, and his legs, which were remarkably numerous, would have\r\nsufficed for several ordinary mortals. In this respect, however,\r\nOsiris was nothing to St. Denys, of whom no less than seven heads,\r\nall equally genuine, are extant.\r\n\r\nAccording to native Egyptian accounts, which supplement that of\r\nPlutarch, when Isis had found the corpse of her husband Osiris, she\r\nand her sister Nephthys sat down beside it and uttered a lament\r\nwhich in after ages became the type of all Egyptian lamentations for\r\nthe dead. "Come to thy house," they wailed. "Come to thy house. O\r\ngod On! come to thy house, thou who hast no foes. O fair youth, come\r\nto thy house, that thou mayest see me. I am thy sister, whom thou\r\nlovest; thou shalt not part from me. O fair boy, come to thy house.\r\n. . . I see thee not, yet doth my heart yearn after thee and mine\r\neyes desire thee. Come to her who loves thee, who loves thee,\r\nUnnefer, thou blessed one! Come to thy sister, come to thy wife, to\r\nthy wife, thou whose heart stands still. Come to thy housewife. I am\r\nthy sister by the same mother, thou shalt not be far from me. Gods\r\nand men have turned their faces towards thee and weep for thee\r\ntogether. . . . I call after thee and weep, so that my cry is heard\r\nto heaven, but thou hearest not my voice; yet am I thy sister, whom\r\nthou didst love on earth; thou didst love none but me, my brother!\r\nmy brother!" This lament for the fair youth cut off in his prime\r\nreminds us of the laments for Adonis. The title of Unnefer or "the\r\nGood Being" bestowed on him marks the beneficence which tradition\r\nuniversally ascribed to Osiris; it was at once his commonest title\r\nand one of his names as king.\r\n\r\nThe lamentations of the two sad sisters were not in vain. In pity\r\nfor her sorrow the sun-god Ra sent down from heaven the\r\njackal-headed god Anubis, who, with the aid of Isis and Nephthys, of\r\nThoth and Horus, pieced together the broken body of the murdered\r\ngod, swathed it in linen bandages, and observed all the other rites\r\nwhich the Egyptians were wont to perform over the bodies of the\r\ndeparted. Then Isis fanned the cold clay with her wings: Osiris\r\nrevived, and thenceforth reigned as king over the dead in the other\r\nworld. There he bore the titles of Lord of the Underworld, Lord of\r\nEternity, Ruler of the Dead. There, too, in the great Hall of the\r\nTwo Truths, assisted by forty-two assessors, one from each of the\r\nprincipal districts of Egypt, he presided as judge at the trial of\r\nthe souls of the departed, who made their solemn confession before\r\nhim, and, their heart having been weighed in the balance of justice,\r\nreceived the reward of virtue in a life eternal or the appropriate\r\npunishment of their sins.\r\n\r\nIn the resurrection of Osiris the Egyptians saw the pledge of a life\r\neverlasting for themselves beyond the grave. They believed that\r\nevery man would live eternally in the other world if only his\r\nsurviving friends did for his body what the gods had done for the\r\nbody of Osiris. Hence the ceremonies observed by the Egyptians over\r\nthe human dead were an exact copy of those which Anubis, Horus, and\r\nthe rest had performed over the dead god. "At every burial there was\r\nenacted a representation of the divine mystery which had been\r\nperformed of old over Osiris, when his son, his sisters, his friends\r\nwere gathered round his mangled remains and succeeded by their\r\nspells and manipulations in converting his broken body into the\r\nfirst mummy, which they afterwards reanimated and furnished with the\r\nmeans of entering on a new individual life beyond the grave. The\r\nmummy of the deceased was Osiris; the professional female mourners\r\nwere his two sisters Isis and Nephthys; Anubis, Horus, all the gods\r\nof the Osirian legend gathered about the corpse." In this way every\r\ndead Egyptian was identified with Osiris and bore his name. From the\r\nMiddle Kingdom onwards it was the regular practice to address the\r\ndeceased as "Osiris So-and-So," as if he were the god himself, and\r\nto add the standing epithet "true of speech," because true speech\r\nwas characteristic of Osiris. The thousands of inscribed and\r\npictured tombs that have been opened in the valley of the Nile prove\r\nthat the mystery of the resurrection was performed for the benefit\r\nof every dead Egyptian; as Osiris died and rose again from the dead,\r\nso all men hoped to arise like him from death to life eternal.\r\n\r\nThus according to what seems to have been the general native\r\ntradition Osiris was a good and beloved king of Egypt, who suffered\r\na violent death but rose from the dead and was henceforth worshipped\r\nas a deity. In harmony with this tradition he was regularly\r\nrepresented by sculptors and painters in human and regal form as a\r\ndead king, swathed in the wrappings of a mummy, but wearing on his\r\nhead a kingly crown and grasping in one of his hands, which were\r\nleft free from the bandages, a kingly sceptre. Two cities above all\r\nothers were associated with his myth or memory. One of them was\r\nBusiris in Lower Egypt, which claimed to possess his backbone; the\r\nother was Abydos in Upper Egypt, which gloried in the possession of\r\nhis head. Encircled by the nimbus of the dead yet living god,\r\nAbydos, originally an obscure place, became from the end of the Old\r\nKingdom the holiest spot in Egypt; his tomb there would seem to have\r\nbeen to the Egyptians what the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at\r\nJerusalem is to Christians. It was the wish of every pious man that\r\nhis dead body should rest in hallowed earth near the grave of the\r\nglorified Osiris. Few indeed were rich enough to enjoy this\r\ninestimable privilege; for, apart from the cost of a tomb in the\r\nsacred city, the mere transport of mummies from great distances was\r\nboth difficult and expensive. Yet so eager were many to absorb in\r\ndeath the blessed influence which radiated from the holy sepulchre\r\nthat they caused their surviving friends to convey their mortal\r\nremains to Abydos, there to tarry for a short time, and then to be\r\nbrought back by river and interred in the tombs which had been made\r\nready for them in their native land. Others had cenotaphs built or\r\nmemorial tablets erected for themselves near the tomb of their dead\r\nand risen Lord, that they might share with him the bliss of a joyful\r\nresurrection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX. The Ritual of Osiris\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Popular Rites\r\n\r\nA USEFUL clue to the original nature of a god or goddess is often\r\nfurnished by the season at which his or her festival is celebrated.\r\nThus, if the festival falls at the new or the full moon, there is a\r\ncertain presumption that the deity thus honoured either is the moon\r\nor at least has lunar affinities. If the festival is held at the\r\nwinter or summer solstice, we naturally surmise that the god is the\r\nsun, or at all events that he stands in some close relation to that\r\nluminary. Again, if the festival coincides with the time of sowing\r\nor harvest, we are inclined to infer that the divinity is an\r\nembodiment of the earth or of the corn. These presumptions or\r\ninferences, taken by themselves, are by no means conclusive; but if\r\nthey happen to be confirmed by other indications, the evidence may\r\nbe regarded as fairly strong.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in dealing with the Egyptian gods we are in a great\r\nmeasure precluded from making use of this clue. The reason is not\r\nthat the dates of the festivals are always unknown, but that they\r\nshifted from year to year, until after a long interval they had\r\nrevolved through the whole course of the seasons. This gradual\r\nrevolution of the festal Egyptian cycle resulted from the employment\r\nof a calendar year which neither corresponded exactly to the solar\r\nyear nor was periodically corrected by intercalation.\r\n\r\nIf the Egyptian farmer of the olden time could get no help, except\r\nat the rarest intervals, from the official or sacerdotal calendar,\r\nhe must have been compelled to observe for himself those natural\r\nsignals which marked the times for the various operations of\r\nhusbandry. In all ages of which we possess any records the Egyptians\r\nhave been an agricultural people, dependent for their subsistence on\r\nthe growth of the corn. The cereals which they cultivated were\r\nwheat, barley, and apparently sorghum (_Holcus sorghum,_ Linnaeus),\r\nthe _doora_ of the modern fellaheen. Then as now the whole country,\r\nwith the exception of a fringe on the coast of the Mediterranean,\r\nwas almost rainless, and owed its immense fertility entirely to the\r\nannual inundation of the Nile, which, regulated by an elaborate\r\nsystem of dams and canals, was distributed over the fields, renewing\r\nthe soil year by year with a fresh deposit of mud washed down from\r\nthe great equatorial lakes and the mountains of Abyssinia. Hence the\r\nrise of the river has always been watched by the inhabitants with\r\nthe utmost anxiety; for if it either falls short of or exceeds a\r\ncertain height, dearth and famine are the inevitable consequences.\r\nThe water begins to rise early in June, but it is not until the\r\nlatter half of July that it swells to a mighty tide. By the end of\r\nSeptember the inundation is at its greatest height. The country is\r\nnow submerged, and presents the appearance of a sea of turbid water,\r\nfrom which the towns and villages, built on higher ground, rise like\r\nislands. For about a month the flood remains nearly stationary, then\r\nsinks more and more rapidly, till by December or January the river\r\nhas returned to its ordinary bed. With the approach of summer the\r\nlevel of the water continues to fall. In the early days of June the\r\nNile is reduced to half its ordinary breadth; and Egypt, scorched by\r\nthe sun, blasted by the wind that has blown from the Sahara for many\r\ndays, seems a mere continuation of the desert. The trees are choked\r\nwith a thick layer of grey dust. A few meagre patches of vegetables,\r\nwatered with difficulty, struggle painfully for existence in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of the villages. Some appearance of verdure\r\nlingers beside the canals and in the hollows from which the moisture\r\nhas not wholly evaporated. The plain appears to pant in the pitiless\r\nsunshine, bare, dusty, ash-coloured, cracked and seamed as far as\r\nthe eye can see with a network of fissures. From the middle of April\r\ntill the middle of June the land of Egypt is but half alive, waiting\r\nfor the new Nile.\r\n\r\nFor countless ages this cycle of natural events has determined the\r\nannual labours of the Egyptian husbandman. The first work of the\r\nagricultural year is the cutting of the dams which have hitherto\r\nprevented the swollen river from flooding the canals and the fields.\r\nThis is done, and the pent-up waters released on their beneficent\r\nmission, in the first half of August. In November, when the\r\ninundation has subsided, wheat, barley, and sorghum are sown. The\r\ntime of harvest varies with the district, falling about a month\r\nlater in the north than in the south. In Upper or Southern Egypt\r\nbarley is reaped at the beginning of March, wheat at the beginning\r\nof April, and sorghum about the end of that month.\r\n\r\nIt is natural to suppose that the various events of the agricultural\r\nyear were celebrated by the Egyptian farmer with some simple\r\nreligious rites designed to secure the blessing of the gods upon his\r\nlabours. These rustic ceremonies he would continue to perform year\r\nafter year at the same season, while the solemn festivals of the\r\npriests continued to shift, with the shifting calendar, from summer\r\nthrough spring to winter, and so backward through autumn to summer.\r\nThe rites of the husbandman were stable because they rested on\r\ndirect observation of nature: the rites of the priest were unstable\r\nbecause they were based on a false calculation. Yet many of the\r\npriestly festivals may have been nothing but the old rural festivals\r\ndisguised in the course of ages by the pomp of sacerdotalism and\r\nsevered, by the error of the calendar, from their roots in the\r\nnatural cycle of the seasons.\r\n\r\nThese conjectures are confirmed by the little we know both of the\r\npopular and of the official Egyptian religion. Thus we are told that\r\nthe Egyptians held a festival of Isis at the time when the Nile\r\nbegan to rise. They believed that the goddess was then mourning for\r\nthe lost Osiris, and that the tears which dropped from her eyes\r\nswelled the impetuous tide of the river. Now if Osiris was in one of\r\nhis aspects a god of the corn, nothing could be more natural than\r\nthat he should be mourned at midsummer. For by that time the harvest\r\nwas past, the fields were bare, the river ran low, life seemed to be\r\nsuspended, the corn-god was dead. At such a moment people who saw\r\nthe handiwork of divine beings in all the operations of nature might\r\nwell trace the swelling of the sacred stream to the tears shed by\r\nthe goddess at the death of the beneficent corn-god her husband.\r\n\r\nAnd the sign of the rising waters on earth was accompanied by a sign\r\nin heaven. For in the early days of Egyptian history, some three or\r\nfour thousand years before the beginning of our era, the splendid\r\nstar of Sirius, the brightest of all the fixed stars, appeared at\r\ndawn in the east just before sunrise about the time of the summer\r\nsolstice, when the Nile begins to rise. The Egyptians called it\r\nSothis, and regarded it as the star of Isis, just as the Babylonians\r\ndeemed the planet Venus the star of Astarte. To both peoples\r\napparently the brilliant luminary in the morning sky seemed the\r\ngoddess of life and love come to mourn her departed lover or spouse\r\nand to wake him from the dead. Hence the rising of Sirius marked the\r\nbeginning of the sacred Egyptian year, and was regularly celebrated\r\nby a festival which did not shift with the shifting official year.\r\n\r\nThe cutting of the dams and the admission of the water into the\r\ncanals and fields is a great event in the Egyptian year. At Cairo\r\nthe operation generally takes place between the sixth and the\r\nsixteenth of August, and till lately was attended by ceremonies\r\nwhich deserve to be noticed, because they were probably handed down\r\nfrom antiquity. An ancient canal, known by the name of the Khal\xedj,\r\nformerly passed through the native town of Cairo. Near its entrance\r\nthe canal was crossed by a dam of earth, very broad at the bottom\r\nand diminishing in breadth upwards, which used to be constructed\r\nbefore or soon after the Nile began to rise. In front of the dam, on\r\nthe side of the river, was reared a truncated cone of earth called\r\nthe \'_arooseh_ or "bride," on the top of which a little maize or\r\nmillet was generally sown. This "bride" was commonly washed down by\r\nthe rising tide a week or a fortnight before the cutting of the dam.\r\nTradition runs that the old custom was to deck a young virgin in gay\r\napparel and throw her into the river as a sacrifice to obtain a\r\nplentiful inundation. Whether that was so or not, the intention of\r\nthe practice appears to have been to marry the river, conceived as a\r\nmale power, to his bride the cornland, which was so soon to be\r\nfertilised by his water. The ceremony was therefore a charm to\r\nensure the growth of the crops. In modern times money used to be\r\nthrown into the canal on this occasion, and the populace dived into\r\nthe water after it. This practice also would seem to have been\r\nancient, for Seneca tells us that at a place called the Veins of the\r\nNile, not far from Philae, the priests used to cast money and\r\nofferings of gold into the river at a festival which apparently took\r\nplace at the rising of the water.\r\n\r\nThe next great operation of the agricultural year in Egypt is the\r\nsowing of the seed in November, when the water of the inundation has\r\nretreated from the fields. With the Egyptians, as with many peoples\r\nof antiquity, the committing of the seed to the earth assumed the\r\ncharacter of a solemn and mournful rite. On this subject I will let\r\nPlutarch speak for himself. "What," he asks, "are we to make of the\r\ngloomy, joyless, and mournful sacrifices, if it is wrong either to\r\nomit the established rites or to confuse and disturb our conceptions\r\nof the gods by absurd suspicions? For the Greeks also perform many\r\nrites which resemble those of the Egyptians and are observed about\r\nthe same time. Thus at the festival of the Thesmophoria in Athens\r\nwomen sit on the ground and fast. And the Boeotians open the vaults\r\nof the Sorrowful One, naming that festival sorrowful because Demeter\r\nis sorrowing for the descent of the Maiden. The month is the month\r\nof sowing about the setting of the Pleiades. The Egyptians call it\r\nAthyr, the Athenians Pyanepsion, the Boeotians the month of Demeter.\r\n. . . For it was that time of year when they saw some of the fruits\r\nvanishing and failing from the trees, while they sowed others\r\ngrudgingly and with difficulty, scraping the earth with their hands\r\nand huddling it up again, on the uncertain chance that what they\r\ndeposited in the ground would ever ripen and come to maturity. Thus\r\nthey did in many respects like those who bury and mourn their dead."\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian harvest, as we have seen, falls not in autumn but in\r\nspring, in the months of March, April, and May. To the husbandman\r\nthe time of harvest, at least in a good year, must necessarily be a\r\nseason of joy: in bringing home his sheaves he is requited for his\r\nlong and anxious labours. Yet if the old Egyptian farmer felt a\r\nsecret joy at reaping and garnering the grain, it was essential that\r\nhe should conceal the natural emotion under an air of profound\r\ndejection. For was he not severing the body of the corn-god with his\r\nsickle and trampling it to pieces under the hoofs of his cattle on\r\nthe threshing-floor? Accordingly we are told that it was an ancient\r\ncustom of the Egyptian corn-reapers to beat their breasts and lament\r\nover the first sheaf cut, while at the same time they called upon\r\nIsis. The invocation seems to have taken the form of a melancholy\r\nchant, to which the Greeks gave the name of Maneros. Similar\r\nplaintive strains were chanted by corn-reapers in Phoenicia and\r\nother parts of Western Asia. Probably all these doleful ditties were\r\nlamentations for the corn-god killed by the sickles of the reapers.\r\nIn Egypt the slain deity was Osiris, and the name _Maneros,_ applied\r\nto the dirge, appears to be derived from certain words meaning "Come\r\nto thy house," which often occur in the lamentations for the dead\r\ngod.\r\n\r\nCeremonies of the same sort have been observed by other peoples,\r\nprobably for the same purpose. Thus we are told that among all\r\nvegetables corn, by which is apparently meant maize, holds the first\r\nplace in the household economy and the ceremonial observance of the\r\nCherokee Indians, who invoke it under the name of "the Old Woman" in\r\nallusion to a myth that it sprang from the blood of an old woman\r\nkilled by her disobedient sons. After the last working of the crop a\r\npriest and his assistant went into the field and sang songs of\r\ninvocation to the spirit of the corn. After that a loud rustling\r\nwould be heard, which was thought to be caused by the Old Woman\r\nbringing the corn into the field. A clean trail was always kept from\r\nthe field to the house, "so that the corn might be encouraged to\r\nstay at home and not go wandering elsewhere." "Another curious\r\nceremony, of which even the memory is now almost forgotten, was\r\nenacted after the first working of the corn, when the owner or\r\npriest stood in succession at each of the four corners of the field\r\nand wept and wailed loudly. Even the priests are now unable to give\r\na reason for this performance, which may have been a lament for the\r\nbloody death of Selu," the Old Woman of the Corn. In these Cherokee\r\npractices the lamentations and the invocations of the Old Woman of\r\nthe Corn resemble the ancient Egyptian customs of lamenting over the\r\nfirst corn cut and calling upon Isis, herself probably in one of her\r\naspects an Old Woman of the Corn. Further, the Cherokee precaution\r\nof leaving a clear path from the field to the house resembles the\r\nEgyptian invitation to Osiris, "Come to thy house." So in the East\r\nIndies to this day people observe elaborate ceremonies for the\r\npurpose of bringing back the Soul of the Rice from the fields to the\r\nbarn. The Nandi of East Africa perform a ceremony in September when\r\nthe eleusine grain is ripening. Every woman who owns a plantation\r\ngoes out with her daughters into the cornfields and makes a bonfire\r\nof the branches and leaves of certain trees. After that they pluck\r\nsome of the eleusine, and each of them puts one grain in her\r\nnecklace, chews another and rubs it on her forehead, throat, and\r\nbreast. "No joy is shown by the womenfolk on this occasion, and they\r\nsorrowfully cut a basketful of the corn which they take home with\r\nthem and place in the loft to dry."\r\n\r\nThe conception of the corn-spirit as old and dead at harvest is very\r\nclearly embodied in a custom observed by the Arabs of Moab. When the\r\nharvesters have nearly finished their task and only a small corner\r\nof the field remains to be reaped, the owner takes a handful of\r\nwheat tied up in a sheaf. A hole is dug in the form of a grave, and\r\ntwo stones are set upright, one at the head and the other at the\r\nfoot, just as in an ordinary burial. Then the sheaf of wheat is laid\r\nat the bottom of the grave, and the sheikh pronounces these words,\r\n"The old man is dead." Earth is afterwards thrown in to cover the\r\nsheaf, with a prayer, "May Allah bring us back the wheat of the\r\ndead."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Official Rites\r\n\r\nSUCH, then, were the principal events of the farmer\'s calendar in\r\nancient Egypt, and such the simple religious rites by which he\r\ncelebrated them. But we have still to consider the Osirian festivals\r\nof the official calendar, so far as these are described by Greek\r\nwriters or recorded on the monuments. In examining them it is\r\nnecessary to bear in mind that on account of the movable year of the\r\nold Egyptian calendar the true or astronomical dates of the official\r\nfestivals must have varied from year to year, at least until the\r\nadoption of the fixed Alexandrian year in 30 B.C. From that time\r\nonward, apparently, the dates of the festivals were determined by\r\nthe new calendar, and so ceased to rotate throughout the length of\r\nthe solar year. At all events Plutarch, writing about the end of the\r\nfirst century, implies that they were then fixed, not movable; for\r\nthough he does not mention the Alexandrian calendar, he clearly\r\ndates the festivals by it. Moreover, the long festal calendar of\r\nEsne, an important document of the Imperial age, is obviously based\r\non the fixed Alexandrian year; for it assigns the mark for New\r\nYear\'s Day to the day which corresponds to the twenty-ninth of\r\nAugust, which was the first day of the Alexandrian year, and its\r\nreferences to the rising of the Nile, the position of the sun, and\r\nthe operations of agriculture are all in harmony with this\r\nsupposition. Thus we may take it as fairly certain that from 30 B.C.\r\nonwards the Egyptian festivals were stationary in the solar year.\r\n\r\nHerodotus tells us that the grave of Osiris was at Sais in Lower\r\nEgypt, and that there was a lake there upon which the sufferings of\r\nthe god were displayed as a mystery by night. This commemoration of\r\nthe divine passion was held once a year: the people mourned and beat\r\ntheir breasts at it to testify their sorrow for the death of the\r\ngod; and an image of a cow, made of gilt wood with a golden sun\r\nbetween its horns, was carried out of the chamber in which it stood\r\nthe rest of the year. The cow no doubt represented Isis herself, for\r\ncows were sacred to her, and she was regularly depicted with the\r\nhorns of a cow on her head, or even as a woman with the head of a\r\ncow. It is probable that the carrying out of her cow-shaped image\r\nsymbolised the goddess searching for the dead body of Osiris; for\r\nthis was the native Egyptian interpretation of a similar ceremony\r\nobserved in Plutarch\'s time about the winter solstice, when the gilt\r\ncow was carried seven times round the temple. A great feature of the\r\nfestival was the nocturnal illumination. People fastened rows of\r\noil-lamps to the outside of their houses, and the lamps burned all\r\nnight long. The custom was not confined to Sais, but was observed\r\nthroughout the whole of Egypt.\r\n\r\nThis universal illumination of the houses on one night of the year\r\nsuggests that the festival may have been a commemoration not merely\r\nof the dead Osiris but of the dead in general, in other words, that\r\nit may have been a night of All Souls. For it is a widespread belief\r\nthat the souls of the dead revisit their old homes on one night of\r\nthe year; and on that solemn occasion people prepare for the\r\nreception of the ghosts by laying out food for them to eat, and\r\nlighting lamps to guide them on their dark road from and to the\r\ngrave. Herodotus, who briefly describes the festival, omits to\r\nmention its date, but we can determine it with some probability from\r\nother sources. Thus Plutarch tells us that Osiris was murdered on\r\nthe seventeenth of the month Athyr, and that the Egyptians\r\naccordingly observed mournful rites for four days from the\r\nseventeenth of Athyr. Now in the Alexandrian calendar, which\r\nPlutarch used, these four days corresponded to the thirteenth,\r\nfourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth of November, and this date\r\nanswers exactly to the other indications given by Plutarch, who says\r\nthat at the time of the festival the Nile was sinking, the north\r\nwinds dying away, the nights lengthening, and the leaves falling\r\nfrom the trees. During these four days a gilt cow swathed in a black\r\npall was exhibited as an image of Isis. This, no doubt, was the\r\nimage mentioned by Herodotus in his account of the festival. On the\r\nnineteenth day of the month the people went down to the sea, the\r\npriests carrying a shrine which contained a golden casket. Into this\r\ncasket they poured fresh water, and thereupon the spectators raised\r\na shout that Osiris was found. After that they took some vegetable\r\nmould, moistened it with water, mixed it with precious spices and\r\nincense, and moulded the paste into a small moon-shaped image, which\r\nwas then robed and ornamented. Thus it appears that the purpose of\r\nthe ceremonies described by Plutarch was to represent dramatically,\r\nfirst, the search for the dead body of Osiris, and, second, its\r\njoyful discovery, followed by the resurrection of the dead god who\r\ncame to life again in the new image of vegetable mould and spices.\r\nLactantius tells us how on these occasions the priests, with their\r\nshaven bodies, beat their breasts and lamented, imitating the\r\nsorrowful search of Isis for her lost son Osiris, and how afterwards\r\ntheir sorrow was turned to joy when the jackal-headed god Anubis, or\r\nrather a mummer in his stead, produced a small boy, the living\r\nrepresentative of the god who was lost and was found. Thus\r\nLactantius regarded Osiris as the son instead of the husband of\r\nIsis, and he makes no mention of the image of vegetable mould. It is\r\nprobable that the boy who figured in the sacred drama played the\r\npart, not of Osiris, but of his son Horus; but as the death and\r\nresurrection of the god were celebrated in many cities of Egypt, it\r\nis also possible that in some places the part of the god come to\r\nlife was played by a living actor instead of by an image. Another\r\nChristian writer describes how the Egyptians, with shorn heads,\r\nannually lamented over a buried idol of Osiris, smiting their\r\nbreasts, slashing their shoulders, ripping open their old wounds,\r\nuntil, after several days of mourning, they professed to find the\r\nmangled remains of the god, at which they rejoiced. However the\r\ndetails of the ceremony may have varied in different places, the\r\npretence of finding the god\'s body, and probably of restoring it to\r\nlife, was a great event in the festal year of the Egyptians. The\r\nshouts of joy which greeted it are described or alluded to by many\r\nancient writers.\r\n\r\nThe funeral rites of Osiris, as they were observed at his great\r\nfestival in the sixteen provinces of Egypt, are described in a long\r\ninscription of the Ptolemaic period, which is engraved on the walls\r\nof the god\'s temple at Denderah, the Tentyra of the Greeks, a town\r\nof Upper Egypt situated on the western bank of the Nile about forty\r\nmiles north of Thebes. Unfortunately, while the information thus\r\nfurnished is remarkably full and minute on many points, the\r\narrangement adopted in the inscription is so confused and the\r\nexpression often so obscure that a clear and consistent account of\r\nthe ceremonies as a whole can hardly be extracted from it. Moreover,\r\nwe learn from the document that the ceremonies varied somewhat in\r\nthe several cities, the ritual of Abydos, for example, differing\r\nfrom that of Busiris. Without attempting to trace all the\r\nparticularities of local usage I shall briefly indicate what seem to\r\nhave been the leading features of the festival, so far as these can\r\nbe ascertained with tolerable certainty.\r\n\r\nThe rites lasted eighteen days, from the twelfth to the thirtieth of\r\nthe month Khoiak, and set forth the nature of Osiris in his triple\r\naspect as dead, dismembered, and finally reconstituted by the union\r\nof his scattered limbs. In the first of these aspects he was called\r\nChent-Ament (Khenti-Amenti), in the second Osiris-Sep, and in the\r\nthird Sokari (Seker). Small images of the god were moulded of sand\r\nor vegetable earth and corn, to which incense was sometimes added;\r\nhis face was painted yellow and his cheek-bones green. These images\r\nwere cast in a mould of pure gold, which represented the god in the\r\nform of a mummy, with the white crown of Egypt on his head. The\r\nfestival opened on the twelfth day of Khoiak with a ceremony of\r\nploughing and sowing. Two black cows were yoked to the plough, which\r\nwas made of tamarisk wood, while the share was of black copper. A\r\nboy scattered the seed. One end of the field was sown with barley,\r\nthe other with spelt, and the middle with flax. During the operation\r\nthe chief celebrant recited the ritual chapter of "the sowing of the\r\nfields." At Busiris on the twentieth of Khoiak sand and barley were\r\nput in the god\'s "garden," which appears to have been a sort of\r\nlarge flower-pot. This was done in the presence of the cow-goddess\r\nShenty, represented seemingly by the image of a cow made of gilt\r\nsycamore wood with a headless human image in its inside. "Then fresh\r\ninundation water was poured out of a golden vase over both the\r\ngoddess and the \'garden,\' and the barley was allowed to grow as the\r\nemblem of the resurrection of the god after his burial in the earth,\r\n\'for the growth of the garden is the growth of the divine\r\nsubstance.\'" On the twenty-second of Khoiak, at the eighth hour, the\r\nimages of Osiris, attended by thirty-four images of deities,\r\nperformed a mysterious voyage in thirty-four tiny boats made of\r\npapyrus, which were illuminated by three hundred and sixty-five\r\nlights. On the twenty-fourth of Khoiak, after sunset, the effigy of\r\nOsiris in a coffin of mulberry wood was laid in the grave, and at\r\nthe ninth hour of the night the effigy which had been made and\r\ndeposited the year before was removed and placed upon boughs of\r\nsycamore. Lastly, on the thirtieth day of Khoiak they repaired to\r\nthe holy sepulchre, a subterranean chamber over which appears to\r\nhave grown a clump of Persea-trees. Entering the vault by the\r\nwestern door, they laid the coffined effigy of the dead god\r\nreverently on a bed of sand in the chamber. So they left him to his\r\nrest, and departed from the sepulchre by the eastern door. Thus\r\nended the ceremonies in the month of Khoiak.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing account of the festival, drawn from the great\r\ninscription of Denderah, the burial of Osiris figures prominently,\r\nwhile his resurrection is implied rather than expressed. This defect\r\nof the document, however, is amply compensated by a remarkable\r\nseries of bas-reliefs which accompany and illustrate the\r\ninscription. These exhibit in a series of scenes the dead god lying\r\nswathed as a mummy on his bier, then gradually raising himself up\r\nhigher and higher, until at last he has entirely quitted the bier\r\nand is seen erect between the guardian wings of the faithful Isis,\r\nwho stands behind him, while a male figure holds up before his eyes\r\nthe _crux ansata,_ the Egyptian symbol of life. The resurrection of\r\nthe god could hardly be portrayed more graphically. Even more\r\ninstructive, however, is another representation of the same event in\r\na chamber dedicated to Osiris in the great temple of Isis at Philae.\r\nHere we see the dead body of Osiris with stalks of corn springing\r\nfrom it, while a priest waters the stalks from a pitcher which he\r\nholds in his hand. The accompanying inscription sets forth that\r\n"this is the form of him whom one may not name, Osiris of the\r\nmysteries, who springs from the returning waters." Taken together,\r\nthe picture and the words seem to leave no doubt that Osiris was\r\nhere conceived and represented as a personification of the corn\r\nwhich springs from the fields after they have been fertilised by the\r\ninundation. This, according to the inscription, was the kernel of\r\nthe mysteries, the innermost secret revealed to the initiated. So in\r\nthe rites of Demeter at Eleusis a reaped ear of corn was exhibited\r\nto the worshippers as the central mystery of their religion. We can\r\nnow fully understand why at the great festival of sowing in the\r\nmonth of Khoiak the priests used to bury effigies of Osiris made of\r\nearth and corn. When these effigies were taken up again at the end\r\nof a year or of a shorter interval, the corn would be found to have\r\nsprouted from the body of Osiris, and this sprouting of the grain\r\nwould be hailed as an omen, or rather as the cause, of the growth of\r\nthe crops. The corn-god produced the corn from himself: he gave his\r\nown body to feed the people: he died that they might live.\r\n\r\nAnd from the death and resurrection of their great god the Egyptians\r\ndrew not only their support and sustenance in this life, but also\r\ntheir hope of a life eternal beyond the grave. This hope is\r\nindicated in the clearest manner by the very remarkable effigies of\r\nOsiris which have come to light in Egyptian cemeteries. Thus in the\r\nValley of the Kings at Thebes there was found the tomb of a royal\r\nfan-bearer who lived about 1500 B.C. Among the rich contents of the\r\ntomb there was a bier on which rested a mattress of reeds covered\r\nwith three layers of linen. On the upper side of the linen was\r\npainted a life-size figure of Osiris; and the interior of the\r\nfigure, which was waterproof, contained a mixture of vegetable\r\nmould, barley, and a sticky fluid. The barley had sprouted and sent\r\nout shoots two or three inches long. Again, in the cemetery at\r\nCynopolis "were numerous burials of Osiris figures. These were made\r\nof grain wrapped up in cloth and roughly shaped like an Osiris, and\r\nplaced inside a bricked-up recess at the side of the tomb, sometimes\r\nin small pottery coffins, sometimes in wooden coffins in the form of\r\na hawkmummy, sometimes without any coffins at all." These\r\ncorn-stuffed figures were bandaged like mummies with patches of\r\ngilding here and there, as if in imitation of the golden mould in\r\nwhich the similar figures of Osiris were cast at the festival of\r\nsowing. Again, effigies of Osiris, with faces of green wax and their\r\ninterior full of grain, were found buried near the necropolis of\r\nThebes. Finally, we are told by Professor Erman that between the\r\nlegs of mummies "there sometimes lies a figure of Osiris made of\r\nslime; it is filled with grains of corn, the sprouting of which is\r\nintended to signify the resurrection of the god." We cannot doubt\r\nthat, just as the burial of corn-stuffed images of Osiris in the\r\nearth at the festival of sowing was designed to quicken the seed, so\r\nthe burial of similar images in the grave was meant to quicken the\r\ndead, in other words, to ensure their spiritual immortality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL. The Nature of Osiris\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Osiris a Corn-god\r\n\r\nTHE FOREGOING survey of the myth and ritual of Osiris may suffice to\r\nprove that in one of his aspects the god was a personification of\r\nthe corn, which may be said to die and come to life again every\r\nyear. Through all the pomp and glamour with which in later times the\r\npriests had invested his worship, the conception of him as the\r\ncorn-god comes clearly out in the festival of his death and\r\nresurrection, which was celebrated in the month of Khoiak and at a\r\nlater period in the month of Athyr. That festival appears to have\r\nbeen essentially a festival of sowing, which properly fell at the\r\ntime when the husbandman actually committed the seed to the earth.\r\nOn that occasion an effigy of the corn-god, moulded of earth and\r\ncorn, was buried with funeral rites in the ground in order that,\r\ndying there, he might come to life again with the new crops. The\r\nceremony was, in fact, a charm to ensure the growth of the corn by\r\nsympathetic magic, and we may conjecture that as such it was\r\npractised in a simple form by every Egyptian farmer on his fields\r\nlong before it was adopted and transfigured by the priests in the\r\nstately ritual of the temple. In the modern, but doubtless ancient,\r\nArab custom of burying "the Old Man," namely, a sheaf of wheat, in\r\nthe harvest-field and praying that he may return from the dead, we\r\nsee the germ out of which the worship of the corn-god Osiris was\r\nprobably developed.\r\n\r\nThe details of his myth fit in well with this interpretation of the\r\ngod. He was said to be the offspring of Sky and Earth. What more\r\nappropriate parentage could be invented for the corn which springs\r\nfrom the ground that has been fertilised by the water of heaven? It\r\nis true that the land of Egypt owed its fertility directly to the\r\nNile and not to showers; but the inhabitants must have known or\r\nguessed that the great river in its turn was fed by the rains which\r\nfell in the far interior. Again, the legend that Osiris was the\r\nfirst to teach men the use of corn would be most naturally told of\r\nthe corn-god himself. Further, the story that his mangled remains\r\nwere scattered up and down the land and buried in different places\r\nmay be a mythical way of expressing either the sowing or the\r\nwinnowing of the grain. The latter interpretation is supported by\r\nthe tale that Isis placed the severed limbs of Osiris on a\r\ncorn-sieve. Or more probably the legend may be a reminiscence of a\r\ncustom of slaying a human victim, perhaps a representative of the\r\ncorn-spirit, and distributing his flesh or scattering his ashes over\r\nthe fields to fertilise them. In modern Europe the figure of Death\r\nis sometimes torn in pieces, and the fragments are then buried in\r\nthe ground to make the crops grow well, and in other parts of the\r\nworld human victims are treated in the same way. With regard to the\r\nancient Egyptians we have it on the authority of Manetho that they\r\nused to burn red-haired men and scatter their ashes with winnowing\r\nfans, and it is highly significant that this barbarous sacrifice was\r\noffered by the kings at the grave of Osiris. We may conjecture that\r\nthe victims represented Osiris himself, who was annually slain,\r\ndismembered, and buried in their persons that he might quicken the\r\nseed in the earth.\r\n\r\nPossibly in prehistoric times the kings themselves played the part\r\nof the god and were slain and dismembered in that character. Set as\r\nwell as Osiris is said to have been torn in pieces after a reign of\r\neighteen days, which was commemorated by an annual festival of the\r\nsame length. According to one story Romulus, the first king of Rome,\r\nwas cut in pieces by the senators, who buried the fragments of him\r\nin the ground; and the traditional day of his death, the seventh of\r\nJuly, was celebrated with certain curious rites, which were\r\napparently connected with the artificial fertilisation of the fig.\r\nAgain, Greek legend told how Pentheus, king of Thebes, and Lycurgus,\r\nking of the Thracian Edonians, opposed the vine-god Dionysus, and\r\nhow the impious monarchs were rent in pieces, the one by the\r\nfrenzied Bacchanals, the other by horses. The Greek traditions may\r\nwell be distorted reminiscences of a custom of sacrificing human\r\nbeings, and especially divine kings, in the character of Dionysus, a\r\ngod who resembled Osiris in many points and was said like him to\r\nhave been torn limb from limb. We are told that in Chios men were\r\nrent in pieces as a sacrifice to Dionysus; and since they died the\r\nsame death as their god, it is reasonable to suppose that they\r\npersonated him. The story that the Thracian Orpheus was similarly\r\ntorn limb from limb by the Bacchanals seems to indicate that he too\r\nperished in the character of the god whose death he died. It is\r\nsignificant that the Thracian Lycurgus, king of the Edonians, is\r\nsaid to have been put to death in order that the ground, which had\r\nceased to be fruitful, might regain its fertility.\r\n\r\nFurther, we read of a Norwegian king, Halfdan the Black, whose body\r\nwas cut up and buried in different parts of his kingdom for the sake\r\nof ensuring the fruitfulness of the earth. He is said to have been\r\ndrowned at the age of forty through the breaking of the ice in\r\nspring. What followed his death is thus related by the old Norse\r\nhistorian Snorri Sturluson: "He had been the most prosperous\r\n(literally, blessed with abundance) of all kings. So greatly did men\r\nvalue him that when the news came that he was dead and his body\r\nremoved to Hringariki and intended for burial there, the chief men\r\nfrom Raumariki and Westfold and Heithm\xf6rk came and all requested\r\nthat they might take his body with them and bury it in their various\r\nprovinces; they thought that it would bring abundance to those who\r\nobtained it. Eventually it was settled that the body was distributed\r\nin four places. The head was laid in a barrow at Steinn in\r\nHringariki, and each party took away their own share and buried it.\r\nAll these barrows are called Halfdan\'s barrows." It should be\r\nremembered that this Halfdan belonged to the family of the Ynglings,\r\nwho traced their descent from Frey, the great Scandinavian god of\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\nThe natives of Kiwai, an island lying off the mouth of the Fly River\r\nin British New Guinea, tell of a certain magician named Segera, who\r\nhad sago for his totem. When Segera was old and ill, he told the\r\npeople that he would soon die, but that, nevertheless, he would\r\ncause their gardens to thrive. Accordingly, he instructed them that\r\nwhen he was dead they should cut him up and place pieces of his\r\nflesh in their gardens, but his head was to be buried in his own\r\ngarden. Of him it is said that he outlived the ordinary age, and\r\nthat no man knew his father, but that he made the sago good and no\r\none was hungry any more. Old men who were alive some years ago\r\naffirmed that they had known Segera in their youth, and the general\r\nopinion of the Kiwai people seems to be that Segera died not more\r\nthan two generations ago.\r\n\r\nTaken all together, these legends point to a widespread practice of\r\ndismembering the body of a king or magician and burying the pieces\r\nin different parts of the country in order to ensure the fertility\r\nof the ground and probably also the fecundity of man and beast.\r\n\r\nTo return to the human victims whose ashes the Egyptians scattered\r\nwith winnowing-fans, the red hair of these unfortunates was probably\r\nsignificant. For in Egypt the oxen which were sacrificed had also to\r\nbe red; a single black or white hair found on the beast would have\r\ndisqualified it for the sacrifice. If, as I conjecture, these human\r\nsacrifices were intended to promote the growth of the crops--and the\r\nwinnowing of their ashes seems to support this view--redhaired\r\nvictims were perhaps selected as best fitted to personate the spirit\r\nof the ruddy grain. For when a god is represented by a living\r\nperson, it is natural that the human representative should be chosen\r\non the ground of his supposed resemblance to the divine original.\r\nHence the ancient Mexicans, conceiving the maize as a personal being\r\nwho went through the whole course of life between seed-time and\r\nharvest, sacrificed new-born babes when the maize was sown, older\r\nchildren when it had sprouted, and so on till it was fully ripe,\r\nwhen they sacrificed old men. A name for Osiris was the "crop" or\r\n"harvest"; and the ancients sometimes explained him as a\r\npersonification of the corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Osiris a Tree-spirit\r\n\r\nBUT Osiris was more than a spirit of the corn; he was also a\r\ntree-spirit, and this may perhaps have been his primitive character,\r\nsince the worship of trees is naturally older in the history of\r\nreligion than the worship of the cereals. The character of Osiris as\r\na tree-spirit was represented very graphically in a ceremony\r\ndescribed by Firmicus Maternus. A pine-tree having been cut down,\r\nthe centre was hollowed out, and with the wood thus excavated an\r\nimage of Osiris was made, which was then buried like a corpse in the\r\nhollow of the tree. It is hard to imagine how the conception of a\r\ntree as tenanted by a personal being could be more plainly\r\nexpressed. The image of Osiris thus made was kept for a year and\r\nthen burned, exactly as was done with the image of Attis which was\r\nattached to the pine-tree. The ceremony of cutting the tree, as\r\ndescribed by Firmicus Maternus, appears to be alluded to by\r\nPlutarch. It was probably the ritual counterpart of the mythical\r\ndiscovery of the body of Osiris enclosed in the _erica_-tree. In the\r\nhall of Osiris at Denderah the coffin containing the hawk-headed\r\nmummy of the god is clearly depicted as enclosed within a tree,\r\napparently a conifer, the trunk and branches of which are seen above\r\nand below the coffin. The scene thus corresponds closely both to the\r\nmyth and to the ceremony described by Firmicus Maternus.\r\n\r\nIt accords with the character of Osiris as a tree-spirit that his\r\nworshippers were forbidden to injure fruit-trees, and with his\r\ncharacter as a god of vegetation in general that they were not\r\nallowed to stop up wells of water, which are so important for the\r\nirrigation of hot southern lands. According to one legend, he taught\r\nmen to train the vine to poles, to prune its superfluous foliage,\r\nand to extract the juice of the grape. In the papyrus of Nebseni,\r\nwritten about 1550 B.C., Osiris is depicted sitting in a shrine,\r\nfrom the roof of which hang clusters of grapes; and in the papyrus\r\nof the royal scribe Nekht we see the god enthroned in front of a\r\npool, from the banks of which a luxuriant vine, with many bunches of\r\ngrapes, grows towards the green face of the seated deity. The ivy\r\nwas sacred to him, and was called his plant because it is always\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Osiris a God of Fertility\r\n\r\nAS A GOD of vegetation Osiris was naturally conceived as a god of\r\ncreative energy in general, since men at a certain stage of\r\nevolution fail to distinguish between the reproductive powers of\r\nanimals and of plants. Hence a striking feature in his worship was\r\nthe coarse but expressive symbolism by which this aspect of his\r\nnature was presented to the eye not merely of the initiated but of\r\nthe multitude. At his festival women used to go about the villages\r\nsinging songs in his praise and carrying obscene images of him which\r\nthey set in motion by means of strings. The custom was probably a\r\ncharm to ensure the growth of the crops. A similar image of him,\r\ndecked with all the fruits of the earth, is said to have stood in a\r\ntemple before a figure of Isis, and in the chambers dedicated to him\r\nat Philae the dead god is portrayed lying on his bier in an attitude\r\nwhich indicates in the plainest way that even in death his\r\ngenerative virtue was not extinct but only suspended, ready to prove\r\na source of life and fertility to the world when the opportunity\r\nshould offer. Hymns addressed to Osiris contain allusions to this\r\nimportant side of his nature. In one of them it is said that the\r\nworld waxes green in triumph through him; and another declares,\r\n"Thou art the father and mother of mankind, they live on thy breath,\r\nthey subsist on the flesh of thy body." We may conjecture that in\r\nthis paternal aspect he was supposed, like other gods of fertility,\r\nto bless men and women with offspring, and that the processions at\r\nhis festival were intended to promote this object as well as to\r\nquicken the seed in the ground. It would be to misjudge ancient\r\nreligion to denounce as lewd and profligate the emblems and the\r\nceremonies which the Egyptians employed for the purpose of giving\r\neffect to this conception of the divine power. The ends which they\r\nproposed to themselves in these rites were natural and laudable;\r\nonly the means they adopted to compass them were mistaken. A similar\r\nfallacy induced the Greeks to adopt a like symbolism in their\r\nDionysiac festivals, and the superficial but striking resemblance\r\nthus produced between the two religions has perhaps more than\r\nanything else misled enquirers, both ancient and modern, into\r\nidentifying worships which, though certainly akin in nature, are\r\nperfectly distinct and independent in origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Osiris a God of the Dead\r\n\r\nWE have seen that in one of his aspects Osiris was the ruler and\r\njudge of the dead. To a people like the Egyptians, who not only\r\nbelieved in a life beyond the grave but actually spent much of their\r\ntime, labour, and money in preparing for it, this office of the god\r\nmust have appeared hardly, if at all, less important than his\r\nfunction of making the earth to bring forth its fruits in due\r\nseason. We may assume that in the faith of his worshippers the two\r\nprovinces of the god were intimately connected. In laying their dead\r\nin the grave they committed them to his keeping who could raise them\r\nfrom the dust to life eternal, even as he caused the seed to spring\r\nfrom the ground. Of that faith the corn-stuffed effigies of Osiris\r\nfound in Egyptian tombs furnish an eloquent and un-equivocal\r\ntestimony. They were at once an emblem and an instrument of\r\nresurrection. Thus from the sprouting of the grain the ancient\r\nEgyptians drew an augury of human immortality. They are not the only\r\npeople who have built the same lofty hopes on the same slender\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nA god who thus fed his people with his own broken body in this life,\r\nand who held out to them a promise of a blissful eternity in a\r\nbetter world hereafter, naturally reigned supreme in their\r\naffections. We need not wonder, therefore, that in Egypt the worship\r\nof the other gods was overshadowed by that of Osiris, and that while\r\nthey were revered each in his own district, he and his divine\r\npartner Isis were adored in all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI. Isis\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGINAL meaning of the goddess Isis is still more difficult to\r\ndetermine than that of her brother and husband Osiris. Her\r\nattributes and epithets were so numerous that in the hieroglyphics\r\nshe is called "the many-named," "the thousand-named," and in Greek\r\ninscriptions "the myriad-named." Yet in her complex nature it is\r\nperhaps still possible to detect the original nucleus round which by\r\na slow process of accretion the other elements gathered. For if her\r\nbrother and husband Osiris was in one of his aspects the corn-god,\r\nas we have seen reason to believe, she must surely have been the\r\ncorn-goddess. There are at least some grounds for thinking so. For\r\nif we may trust Diodorus Siculus, whose authority appears to have\r\nbeen the Egyptian historian Manetho, the discovery of wheat and\r\nbarley was attributed to Isis, and at her festivals stalks of these\r\ngrains were carried in procession to commemorate the boon she had\r\nconferred on men. A further detail is added by Augustine. He says\r\nthat Isis made the discovery of barley at the moment when she was\r\nsacrificing to the common ancestors of her husband and herself, all\r\nof whom had been kings, and that she showed the newly discovered\r\nears of barley to Osiris and his councillor Thoth or Mercury, as\r\nRoman writers called him. That is why, adds Augustine, they identify\r\nIsis with Ceres. Further, at harvest-time, when the Egyptian reapers\r\nhad cut the first stalks, they laid them down and beat their\r\nbreasts, wailing and calling upon Isis. The custom has been already\r\nexplained as a lamen for the corn-spirit slain under the sickle.\r\nAmongst the epithets by which Isis is designated in the inscriptions\r\nare "Creatress of green things," "Green goddess, whose green colour\r\nis like unto the greenness of the earth," "Lady of Bread," "Lady of\r\nBeer," "Lady of Abundance." According to Brugsch she is "not only\r\nthe creatress of the fresh verdure of vegetation which covers the\r\nearth, but is actually the green corn-field itself, which is\r\npersonified as a goddess." This is confirmed by her epithet _Sochit_\r\nor _Sochet,_ meaning "a corn-field," a sense which the word still\r\nretains in Coptic. The Greeks conceived of Isis as a corn-goddess,\r\nfor they identified her with Demeter. In a Greek epigram she is\r\ndescribed as "she who has given birth to the fruits of the earth,"\r\nand "the mother of the ears of corn"; and in a hymn composed in her\r\nhonour she speaks of herself as "queen of the wheat-field," and is\r\ndescribed as "charged with the care of the fruitful furrow\'s\r\nwheat-rich path." Accordingly, Greek or Roman artists often\r\nrepresented her with ears of corn on her head or in her hand.\r\n\r\nSuch, we may suppose, was Isis in the olden time, a rustic\r\nCorn-Mother adored with uncouth rites by Egyptian swains. But the\r\nhomely features of the clownish goddess could hardly be traced in\r\nthe refined, the saintly form which, spiritualised by ages of\r\nreligious evolution, she presented to her worshippers of after days\r\nas the true wife, the tender mother, the beneficent queen of nature,\r\nencircled with the nimbus of moral purity, of immemorial and\r\nmysterious sanctity. Thus chastened and transfigured she won many\r\nhearts far beyond the boundaries of her native land. In that welter\r\nof religions which accompanied the decline of national life in\r\nantiquity her worship was one of the most popular at Rome and\r\nthroughout the empire. Some of the Roman emperors themselves were\r\nopenly addicted to it. And however the religion of Isis may, like\r\nany other, have been often worn as a cloak by men and women of loose\r\nlife, her rites appear on the whole to have been honourably\r\ndistinguished by a dignity and composure, a solemnity and decorum,\r\nwell fitted to soothe the troubled mind, to ease the burdened heart.\r\nThey appealed therefore to gentle spirits, and above all to women,\r\nwhom the bloody and licentious rites of other Oriental goddesses\r\nonly shocked and repelled. We need not wonder, then, that in a\r\nperiod of decadence, when traditional faiths were shaken, when\r\nsystems clashed, when men\'s minds were disquieted, when the fabric\r\nof empire itself, once deemed eternal, began to show ominous rents\r\nand fissures, the serene figure of Isis with her spiritual calm, her\r\ngracious promise of immortality, should have appeared to many like a\r\nstar in a stormy sky, and should have roused in their breasts a\r\nrapture of devotion not unlike that which was paid in the Middle\r\nAges to the Virgin Mary. Indeed her stately ritual, with its shaven\r\nand tonsured priests, its matins and vespers, its tinkling music,\r\nits baptism and aspersions of holy water, its solemn processions,\r\nits jewelled images of the Mother of God, presented many points of\r\nsimilarity to the pomps and ceremonies of Catholicism. The\r\nresemblance need not be purely accidental. Ancient Egypt may have\r\ncontributed its share to the gorgeous symbolism of the Catholic\r\nChurch as well as to the pale abstractions of her theology.\r\nCertainly in art the figure of Isis suckling the infant Horus is so\r\nlike that of the Madonna and child that it has sometimes received\r\nthe adoration of ignorant Christians. And to Isis in her later\r\ncharacter of patroness of mariners the Virgin Mary perhaps owes her\r\nbeautiful epithet of _Stella Maris,_ "Star of the Sea," under which\r\nshe is adored by tempest-tossed sailors. The attributes of a marine\r\ndeity may have been bestowed on Isis by the sea-faring Greeks of\r\nAlexandria. They are quite foreign to her original character and to\r\nthe habits of the Egyptians, who had no love of the sea. On this\r\nhypothesis Sirius, the bright star of Isis, which on July mornings\r\nrises from the glassy waves of the eastern Mediterranean, a\r\nharbinger of halcyon weather to mariners, was the true _Stella\r\nMaris,_ "the Star of the Sea."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII. Osiris and the Sun\r\n\r\nOSIRIS has been sometimes interpreted as the sun-god, and in modern\r\ntimes this view has been held by so many distinguished writers that\r\nit deserves a brief examination. If we enquire on what evidence\r\nOsiris has been identified with the sun or the sun-god, it will be\r\nfound on analysis to be minute in quantity and dubious, where it is\r\nnot absolutely worthless, in quality. The diligent Jablonski, the\r\nfirst modern scholar to collect and sift the testimony of classical\r\nwriters on Egyptian religion, says that it can be shown in many ways\r\nthat Osiris is the sun, and that he could produce a cloud of\r\nwitnesses to prove it, but that it is needless to do so, since no\r\nlearned man is ignorant of the fact. Of the ancient writers whom he\r\ncondescends to quote, the only two who expressly identify Osiris\r\nwith the sun are Diodorus and Macrobius. But little weight can be\r\nattached to their evidence; for the statement of Diodorus is vague\r\nand rhetorical, and the reasons which Macrobius, one of the fathers\r\nof solar mythology, assigns for the identification are exceedingly\r\nslight.\r\n\r\nThe ground upon which some modern writers seem chiefly to rely for\r\nthe identification of Osiris with the sun is that the story of his\r\ndeath fits better with the solar phenomena than with any other in\r\nnature. It may readily be admitted that the daily appearance and\r\ndisappearance of the sun might very naturally be expressed by a myth\r\nof his death and resurrection; and writers who regard Osiris as the\r\nsun are careful to indicate that it is the diurnal, and not the\r\nannual, course of the sun to which they understand the myth to\r\napply. Thus Renouf, who identified Osiris with the sun, admitted\r\nthat the Egyptian sun could not with any show of reason be described\r\nas dead in winter. But if his daily death was the theme of the\r\nlegend, why was it celebrated by an annual ceremony? This fact alone\r\nseems fatal to the interpretation of the myth as descriptive of\r\nsunset and sunrise. Again, though the sun may be said to die daily,\r\nin what sense can he be said to be torn in pieces?\r\n\r\nIn the course of our enquiry it has, I trust, been made clear that\r\nthere is another natural phenomenon to which the conception of death\r\nand resurrection is as applicable as to sunset and sunrise, and\r\nwhich, as a matter of fact, has been so conceived and represented in\r\nfolk-custom. That phenomenon is the annual growth and decay of\r\nvegetation. A strong reason for interpreting the death of Osiris as\r\nthe decay of vegetation rather than as the sunset is to be found in\r\nthe general, though not unanimous, voice of antiquity, which classed\r\ntogether the worship and myths of Osiris, Adonis, Attis, Dionysus,\r\nand Demeter, as religions of essentially the same type. The\r\nconsensus of ancient opinion on this subject seems too great to be\r\nrejected as a mere fancy. So closely did the rites of Osiris\r\nresemble those of Adonis at Byblus that some of the people of Byblus\r\nthemselves maintained that it was Osiris and not Adonis whose death\r\nwas mourned by them. Such a view could certainly not have been held\r\nif the rituals of the two gods had not been so alike as to be almost\r\nindistinguishable. Herodotus found the similarity between the rites\r\nof Osiris and Dionysus so great, that he thought it impossible the\r\nlatter could have arisen independently; they must, he supposed, have\r\nbeen recently borrowed, with slight alterations, by the Greeks from\r\nthe Egyptians. Again, Plutarch, a very keen student of comparative\r\nreligion, insists upon the detailed resemblance of the rites of\r\nOsiris to those of Dionysus. We cannot reject the evidence of such\r\nintelligent and trustworthy witnesses on plain matters of fact which\r\nfell under their own cognizance. Their explanations of the worships\r\nit is indeed possible to reject, for the meaning of religious cults\r\nis often open to question; but resemblances of ritual are matters of\r\nobservation. Therefore, those who explain Osiris as the sun are\r\ndriven to the alternative of either dismissing as mistaken the\r\ntestimony of antiquity to the similarity of the rites of Osiris,\r\nAdonis, Attis, Dionysus, and Demeter, or of interpreting all these\r\nrites as sun-worship. No modern scholar has fairly faced and\r\naccepted either side of this alternative. To accept the former would\r\nbe to affirm that we know the rites of these deities better than the\r\nmen who practised, or at least who witnessed them. To accept the\r\nlatter would involve a wrenching, clipping, mangling, and distorting\r\nof myth and ritual from which even Macrobius shrank. On the other\r\nhand, the view that the essence of all these rites was the mimic\r\ndeath and revival of vegetation, explains them separately and\r\ncollectively in an easy and natural way, and harmonises with the\r\ngeneral testimony borne by the ancients to their substantial\r\nsimilarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII. Dionysus\r\n\r\nIN THE PRECEDING chapters we saw that in antiquity the civilised\r\nnations of Western Asia and Egypt pictured to themselves the changes\r\nof the seasons, and particularly the annual growth and decay of\r\nvegetation, as episodes in the life of gods, whose mournful death\r\nand happy resurrection they celebrated with dramatic rites of\r\nalternate lamentation and rejoicing. But if the celebration was in\r\nform dramatic, it was in substance magical; that is to say, it was\r\nintended, on the principles of sympathetic magic, to ensure the\r\nvernal regeneration of plants and the multiplication of animals,\r\nwhich had seemed to be menaced by the inroads of winter. In the\r\nancient world, however, such ideas and such rites were by no means\r\nconfined to the Oriental peoples of Babylon and Syria, of Phrygia\r\nand Egypt; they were not a product peculiar to the religious\r\nmysticism of the dreamy East, but were shared by the races of\r\nlivelier fancy and more mercurial temperament who inhabited the\r\nshores and islands of the Aegean. We need not, with some enquirers\r\nin ancient and modern times, suppose that these Western peoples\r\nborrowed from the older civilisation of the Orient the conception of\r\nthe Dying and Reviving God, together with the solemn ritual, in\r\nwhich that conception was dramatically set forth before the eyes of\r\nthe worshippers. More probably the resemblance which may be traced\r\nin this respect between the religions of the East and West is no\r\nmore than what we commonly, though incorrectly, call a fortuitous\r\ncoincidence, the effect of similar causes acting alike on the\r\nsimilar constitution of the human mind in different countries and\r\nunder different skies. The Greek had no need to journey into far\r\ncountries to learn the vicissitudes of the seasons, to mark the\r\nfleeting beauty of the damask rose, the transient glory of the\r\ngolden corn, the passing splendour of the purple grapes. Year by\r\nyear in his own beautiful land he beheld, with natural regret, the\r\nbright pomp of summer fading into the gloom and stagnation of\r\nwinter, and year by year he hailed with natural delight the outburst\r\nof fresh life in spring. Accustomed to personify the forces of\r\nnature, to tinge her cold abstractions with the warm hues of\r\nimagination, to clothe her naked realities with the gorgeous drapery\r\nof a mythic fancy, he fashioned for himself a train of gods and\r\ngoddesses, of spirits and elves, out of the shifting panorama of the\r\nseasons, and followed the annual fluctuations of their fortunes with\r\nalternate emotions of cheerfulness and dejection, of gladness and\r\nsorrow, which found their natural expression in alternate rites of\r\nrejoicing and lamentation, of revelry and mourning. A consideration\r\nof some of the Greek divinities who thus died and rose again from\r\nthe dead may furnish us with a series of companion pictures to set\r\nside by side with the sad figures of Adonis, Attis, and Osiris. We\r\nbegin with Dionysus.\r\n\r\nThe god Dionysus or Bacchus is best known to us as a personification\r\nof the vine and of the exhilaration produced by the juice of the\r\ngrape. His ecstatic worship, characterised by wild dances, thrilling\r\nmusic, and tipsy excess, appears to have originated among the rude\r\ntribes of Thrace, who were notoriously addicted to drunkenness. Its\r\nmystic doctrines and extravagant rites were essentially foreign to\r\nthe clear intelligence and sober temperament of the Greek race. Yet\r\nappealing as it did to that love of mystery and that proneness to\r\nrevert to savagery which seem to be innate in most men, the religion\r\nspread like wildfire through Greece until the god whom Homer hardly\r\ndeigned to notice had become the most popular figure of the\r\npantheon. The resemblance which his story and his ceremonies present\r\nto those of Osiris have led some enquirers both in ancient and\r\nmodern times to hold that Dionysus was merely a disguised Osiris,\r\nimported directly from Egypt into Greece. But the great\r\npreponderance of evidence points to his Thracian origin, and the\r\nsimilarity of the two worships is sufficiently explained by the\r\nsimilarity of the ideas and customs on which they were founded.\r\n\r\nWhile the vine with its clusters was the most characteristic\r\nmanifestation of Dionysus, he was also a god of trees in general.\r\nThus we are told that almost all the Greeks sacrificed to "Dionysus\r\nof the tree." In Boeotia one of his titles was "Dionysus in the\r\ntree." His image was often merely an upright post, without arms, but\r\ndraped in a mantle, with a bearded mask to represent the head, and\r\nwith leafy boughs projecting from the head or body to show the\r\nnature of the deity. On a vase his rude effigy is depicted appearing\r\nout of a low tree or bush. At Magnesia on the Maeander an image of\r\nDionysus is said to have been found in a plane-tree, which had been\r\nbroken by the wind. He was the patron of cultivated trees: prayers\r\nwere offered to him that he would make the trees grow; and he was\r\nespecially honoured by husbandmen, chiefly fruit-growers, who set up\r\nan image of him, in the shape of a natural tree-stump, in their\r\norchards. He was said to have discovered all tree-fruits, amongst\r\nwhich apples and figs are particularly mentioned; and he was\r\nreferred to as "well-fruited," "he of the green fruit," and "making\r\nthe fruit to grow." One of his titles was "teeming" or "bursting"\r\n(as of sap or blossoms); and there was a Flowery Dionysus in Attica\r\nand at Patrae in Achaia. The Athenians sacrificed to him for the\r\nprosperity of the fruits of the land. Amongst the trees particularly\r\nsacred to him, in addition to the vine, was the pine-tree. The\r\nDelphic oracle commanded the Corinthians to worship a particular\r\npine-tree "equally with the god," so they made two images of\r\nDionysus out of it, with red faces and gilt bodies. In art a wand,\r\ntipped with a pine-cone, is commonly carried by the god or his\r\nworshippers. Again, the ivy and the fig-tree were especially\r\nassociated with him. In the Attic township of Acharnae there was a\r\nDionysus Ivy; at Lacedaemon there was a Fig Dionysus; and in Naxos,\r\nwhere figs were called _meilicha,_ there was a Dionysus Meilichios,\r\nthe face of whose image was made of fig-wood.\r\n\r\nFurther, there are indications, few but significant, that Dionysus\r\nwas conceived as a deity of agriculture and the corn. He is spoken\r\nof as himself doing the work of a husbandman: he is reported to have\r\nbeen the first to yoke oxen to the plough, which before had been\r\ndragged by hand alone; and some people found in this tradition the\r\nclue to the bovine shape in which, as we shall see, the god was\r\noften supposed to present himself to his worshippers. Thus guiding\r\nthe ploughshare and scattering the seed as he went, Dionysus is said\r\nto have eased the labour of the husbandman. Further, we are told\r\nthat in the land of the Bisaltae, a Thracian tribe, there was a\r\ngreat and fair sanctuary of Dionysus, where at his festival a bright\r\nlight shone forth at night as a token of an abundant harvest\r\nvouchsafed by the diety; but if the crops were to fail that year,\r\nthe mystic light was not seen, darkness brooded over the sanctuary\r\nas at other times. Moreover, among the emblems of Dionysus was the\r\nwinnowing-fan, that is the large open shovel-shaped basket, which\r\ndown to modern times has been used by farmers to separate the grain\r\nfrom the chaff by tossing the corn in the air. This simple\r\nagricultural instrument figured in the mystic rites of Dionysus;\r\nindeed the god is traditionally said to have been placed at birth in\r\na winnowing-fan as in a cradle: in art he is represented as an\r\ninfant so cradled; and from these traditions and representations he\r\nderived the epithet of _Liknites,_ that is, "He of the\r\nWinnowing-fan."\r\n\r\nLike other gods of vegetation Dionysus was believed to have died a\r\nviolent death, but to have been brought to life again; and his\r\nsufferings, death, and resurrection were enacted in his sacred\r\nrites. His tragic story is thus told by the poet Nonnus. Zeus in the\r\nform of a serpent visited Persephone, and she bore him Zagreus, that\r\nis, Dionysus, a horned infant. Scarcely was he born, when the babe\r\nmounted the throne of his father Zeus and mimicked the great god by\r\nbrandishing the lightning in his tiny hand. But he did not occupy\r\nthe throne long; for the treacherous Titans, their faces whitened\r\nwith chalk, attacked him with knives while he was looking at himself\r\nin a mirror. For a time he evaded their assaults by turning himself\r\ninto various shapes, assuming the likeness successively of Zeus and\r\nCronus, of a young man, of a lion, a horse, and a serpent. Finally,\r\nin the form of a bull, he was cut to pieces by the murderous knives\r\nof his enemies. His Cretan myth, as related by Firmicus Maternus,\r\nran thus. He was said to have been the bastard son of Jupiter, a\r\nCretan king. Going abroad, Jupiter transferred the throne and\r\nsceptre to the youthful Dionysus, but, knowing that his wife Juno\r\ncherished a jealous dislike of the child, he entrusted Dionysus to\r\nthe care of guards upon whose fidelity he believed he could rely.\r\nJuno, however, bribed the guards, and amusing the child with rattles\r\nand a cunningly-wrought looking glass lured him into an ambush,\r\nwhere her satellites, the Titans, rushed upon him, cut him limb from\r\nlimb, boiled his body with various herbs, and ate it. But his sister\r\nMinerva, who had shared in the deed, kept his heart and gave it to\r\nJupiter on his return, revealing to him the whole history of the\r\ncrime. In his rage, Jupiter put the Titans to death by torture, and,\r\nto soothe his grief for the loss of his son, made an image in which\r\nhe enclosed the child\'s heart, and then built a temple in his\r\nhonour. In this version a Euhemeristic turn has been given to the\r\nmyth by representing Jupiter and Juno (Zeus and Hera) as a king and\r\nqueen of Crete. The guards referred to are the mythical Curetes who\r\ndanced a war-dance round the infant Dionysus, as they are said to\r\nhave done round the infant Zeus. Very noteworthy is the legend,\r\nrecorded both by Nonnus and Firmicus, that in his infancy Dionysus\r\noccupied for a short time the throne of his father Zeus. So Proclus\r\ntells us that "Dionysus was the last king of the gods appointed by\r\nZeus. For his father set him on the kingly throne, and placed in his\r\nhand the sceptre, and made him king of all the gods of the world."\r\nSuch traditions point to a custom of temporarily investing the\r\nking\'s son with the royal dignity as a preliminary to sacrificing\r\nhim instead of his father. Pomegranates were supposed to have sprung\r\nfrom the blood of Dionysus, as anemones from the blood of Adonis and\r\nviolets from the blood of Attis: hence women refrained from eating\r\nseeds of pomegranates at the festival of the Thesmophoria. According\r\nto some, the severed limbs of Dionysus were pieced together, at the\r\ncommand of Zeus, by Apollo, who buried them on Parnassus. The grave\r\nof Dionysus was shown in the Delphic temple beside a golden statue\r\nof Apollo. However, according to another account, the grave of\r\nDionysus was at Thebes, where he is said to have been torn in\r\npieces. Thus far the resurrection of the slain god is not mentioned,\r\nbut in other versions of the myth it is variously related. According\r\nto one version, which represented Dionysus as a son of Zeus and\r\nDemeter, his mother pieced together his mangled limbs and made him\r\nyoung again. In others it is simply said that shortly after his\r\nburial he rose from the dead and ascended up to heaven; or that Zeus\r\nraised him up as he lay mortally wounded; or that Zeus swallowed the\r\nheart of Dionysus and then begat him afresh by Semele, who in the\r\ncommon legend figures as mother of Dionysus. Or, again, the heart\r\nwas pounded up and given in a potion to Semele, who thereby\r\nconceived him.\r\n\r\nTurning from the myth to the ritual, we find that the Cretans\r\ncelebrated a biennial festival at which the passion of Dionysus was\r\nrepresented in every detail. All that he had done or suffered in his\r\nlast moments was enacted before the eyes of his worshippers, who\r\ntore a live bull to pieces with their teeth and roamed the woods\r\nwith frantic shouts. In front of them was carried a casket supposed\r\nto contain the sacred heart of Dionysus, and to the wild music of\r\nflutes and cymbals they mimicked the rattles by which the infant god\r\nhad been lured to his doom. Where the resurrection formed part of\r\nthe myth, it also was acted at the rites, and it even appears that a\r\ngeneral doctrine of resurrection, or at least of immortality, was\r\ninculcated on the worshippers; for Plutarch, writing to console his\r\nwife on the death of their infant daughter, comforts her with the\r\nthought of the immortality of the soul as taught by tradition and\r\nrevealed in the mysteries of Dionysus. A different form of the myth\r\nof the death and resurrection of Dionysus is that he descended into\r\nHades to bring up his mother Semele from the dead. The local Argive\r\ntradition was that he went down through the Alcyonian lake; and his\r\nreturn from the lower world, in other words his resurrection, was\r\nannually celebrated on the spot by the Argives, who summoned him\r\nfrom the water by trumpet blasts, while they threw a lamb into the\r\nlake as an offering to the warder of the dead. Whether this was a\r\nspring festival does not appear, but the Lydians certainly\r\ncelebrated the advent of Dionysus in spring; the god was supposed to\r\nbring the season with him. Deities of vegetation, who are believed\r\nto pass a certain portion of each year underground, naturally come\r\nto be regarded as gods of the lower world or of the dead. Both\r\nDionysus and Osiris were so conceived.\r\n\r\nA feature in the mythical character of Dionysus, which at first\r\nsight appears inconsistent with his nature as a deity of vegetation,\r\nis that he was often conceived and represented in animal shape,\r\nespecially in the form, or at least with the horns, of a bull. Thus\r\nhe is spoken of as "cow-born," "bull," "bull-shaped," "bull-faced,"\r\n"bull-browed," "bull-horned," "horn-bearing," "two-horned,"\r\n"horned." He was believed to appear, at least occasionally, as a\r\nbull. His images were often, as at Cyzicus, made in bull shape, or\r\nwith bull horns; and he was painted with horns. Types of the horned\r\nDionysus are found amongst the surviving monuments of antiquity. On\r\none statuette he appears clad in a bull\'s hide, the head, horns, and\r\nhoofs hanging down behind. Again, he is represented as a child with\r\nclusters of grapes round his brow, and a calf\'s head, with sprouting\r\nhorns, attached to the back of his head. On a red-figured vase the\r\ngod is portrayed as a calf-headed child seated on a woman\'s lap. The\r\npeople of Cynaetha held a festival of Dionysus in winter, when men,\r\nwho had greased their bodies with oil for the occasion, used to pick\r\nout a bull from the herd and carry it to the sanctuary of the god.\r\nDionysus was supposed to inspire their choice of the particular\r\nbull, which probably represented the deity himself; for at his\r\nfestivals he was believed to appear in bull form. The women of Elis\r\nhailed him as a bull, and prayed him to come with his bull\'s foot.\r\nThey sang, "Come hither, Dionysus, to thy holy temple by the sea;\r\ncome with the Graces to thy temple, rushing with thy bull\'s foot, O\r\ngoodly bull, O goodly bull!" The Bacchanals of Thrace wore horns in\r\nimitation of their god. According to the myth, it was in the shape\r\nof a bull that he was torn to pieces by the Titans; and the Cretans,\r\nwhen they acted the sufferings and death of Dionysus, tore a live\r\nbull to pieces with their teeth. Indeed, the rending and devouring\r\nof live bulls and calves appear to have been a regular feature of\r\nthe Dionysiac rites. When we consider the practice of portraying the\r\ngod as a bull or with some of the features of the animal, the belief\r\nthat he appeared in bull form to his worshippers at the sacred\r\nrites, and the legend that in bull form he had been torn in pieces,\r\nwe cannot doubt that in rending and devouring a live bull at his\r\nfestival the worshippers of Dionysus believed themselves to be\r\nkilling the god, eating his flesh, and drinking his blood.\r\n\r\nAnother animal whose form Dionysus assumed was the goat. One of his\r\nnames was "Kid." At Athens and at Hermion he was worshipped under\r\nthe title of "the one of the Black Goatskin," and a legend ran that\r\non a certain occasion he had appeared clad in the skin from which he\r\ntook the title. In the wine-growing district of Phlius, where in\r\nautumn the plain is still thickly mantled with the red and golden\r\nfoliage of the fading vines, there stood of old a bronze image of a\r\ngoat, which the husbandmen plastered with gold-leaf as a means of\r\nprotecting their vines against blight. The image probably\r\nrepresented the vine-god himself. To save him from the wrath of\r\nHera, his father Zeus changed the youthful Dionysus into a kid; and\r\nwhen the gods fled to Egypt to escape the fury of Typhon, Dionysus\r\nwas turned into a goat. Hence when his worshippers rent in pieces a\r\nlive goat and devoured it raw, they must have believed that they\r\nwere eating the body and blood of the god. The custom of tearing in\r\npieces the bodies of animals and of men and then devouring them raw\r\nhas been practised as a religious rite by savages in modern times.\r\nWe need not therefore dismiss as a fable the testimony of antiquity\r\nto the observance of similar rites among the frenzied worshippers of\r\nBacchus.\r\n\r\nThe custom of killing a god in animal form, which we shall examine\r\nmore in detail further on, belongs to a very early stage of human\r\nculture, and is apt in later times to be misunderstood. The advance\r\nof thought tends to strip the old animal and plant gods of their\r\nbestial and vegetable husk, and to leave their human attributes\r\n(which are always the kernel of the conception) as the final and\r\nsole residuum. In other words, animal and plant gods tend to become\r\npurely anthropomorphic. When they have become wholly or nearly so,\r\nthe animals and plants which were at first the deities themselves,\r\nstill retain a vague and ill-understood connexion with the\r\nanthropomorphic gods who have developed out of them. The origin of\r\nthe relationship between the deity and the animal or plant having\r\nbeen forgotten, various stories are invented to explain it. These\r\nexplanations may follow one of two lines according as they are based\r\non the habitual or on the exceptional treatment of the sacred animal\r\nor plant. The sacred animal was habitually spared, and only\r\nexceptionally slain; and accordingly the myth might be devised to\r\nexplain either why it was spared or why it was killed. Devised for\r\nthe former purpose, the myth would tell of some service rendered to\r\nthe deity by the animal; devised for the latter purpose, the myth\r\nwould tell of some injury inflicted by the animal on the god. The\r\nreason given for sacrificing goats to Dionysus exemplifies a myth of\r\nthe latter sort. They were sacrificed to him, it was said, because\r\nthey injured the vine. Now the goat, as we have seen, was originally\r\nan embodiment of the god himself. But when the god had divested\r\nhimself of his animal character and had become essentially\r\nanthropomorphic, the killing of the goat in his worship came to be\r\nregarded no longer as a slaying of the deity himself, but as a\r\nsacrifice offered to him; and since some reason had to be assigned\r\nwhy the goat in particular should be sacrificed, it was alleged that\r\nthis was a punishment inflicted on the goat for injuring the vine,\r\nthe object of the god\'s especial care. Thus we have the strange\r\nspectacle of a god sacrificed to himself on the ground that he is\r\nhis own enemy. And as the deity is supposed to partake of the victim\r\noffered to him, it follows that, when the victim is the god\'s old\r\nself, the god eats of his own flesh. Hence the goat-god Dionysus is\r\nrepresented as eating raw goat\'s blood; and the bull-god Dionysus is\r\ncalled "eater of bulls." On the analogy of these instances we may\r\nconjecture that wherever a deity is described as the eater of a\r\nparticular animal, the animal in question was originally nothing but\r\nthe deity himself. Later on we shall find that some savages\r\npropitiate dead bears and whales by offering them portions of their\r\nown bodies.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, does not explain why a deity of vegetation should\r\nappear in animal form. But the consideration of that point had\r\nbetter be deferred till we have discussed the character and\r\nattributes of Demeter. Meantime it remains to mention that in some\r\nplaces, instead of an animal, a human being was torn in pieces at\r\nthe rites of Dionysus. This was the practice in Chios and Tenedos;\r\nand at Potniae in Boeotia the tradition ran that it had been\r\nformerly the custom to sacrifice to the goat-smiting Dionysus a\r\nchild, for whom a goat was afterwards substituted. At Orchomenus, as\r\nwe have seen, the human victim was taken from the women of an old\r\nroyal family. As the slain bull or goat represented the slain god,\r\nso, we may suppose, the human victim also represented him.\r\n\r\nThe legends of the deaths of Pentheus and Lycurgus, two kings who\r\nare said to have been torn to pieces, the one by Bacchanals, the\r\nother by horses, for their opposition to the rites of Dionysus, may\r\nbe, as I have already suggested, distorted reminiscences of a custom\r\nof sacrificing divine kings in the character of Dionysus and of\r\ndispersing the fragments of their broken bodies over the fields for\r\nthe purpose of fertilising them. It is probably no mere coincidence\r\nthat Dionysus himself is said to have been torn in pieces at Thebes,\r\nthe very place where according to legend the same fate befell king\r\nPentheus at the hands of the frenzied votaries of the vine-god.\r\n\r\nHowever, a tradition of human sacrifice may sometimes have been a\r\nmere misinterpretation of a sacrificial ritual in which an animal\r\nvictim was treated as a human being. For example, at Tenedos the\r\nnew-born calf sacrificed to Dionysus was shod in buskins, and the\r\nmother cow was tended like a woman in child-bed. At Rome a shegoat\r\nwas sacrificed to Vedijovis as if it were a human victim. Yet on the\r\nother hand it is equally possible, and perhaps more probable, that\r\nthese curious rites were themselves mitigations of an older and\r\nruder custom of sacrificing human beings, and that the later\r\npretence of treating the sacrificial victims as if they were human\r\nbeings was merely part of a pious and merciful fraud, which palmed\r\noff on the deity less precious victims than living men and women.\r\nThis interpretation is supported by many undoubted cases in which\r\nanimals have been substituted for human victims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV. Demeter and Persephone\r\n\r\nDIONYSUS was not the only Greek deity whose tragic story and ritual\r\nappear to reflect the decay and revival of vegetation. In another\r\nform and with a different application the old tale reappears in the\r\nmyth of Demeter and Persephone. Substantially their myth is\r\nidentical with the Syrian one of Aphrodite (Astarte) and Adonis, the\r\nPhrygian one of Cybele and Attis, and the Egyptian one of Isis and\r\nOsiris. In the Greek fable, as in its Asiatic and Egyptian\r\ncounterparts, a goddess mourns the loss of a loved one, who\r\npersonifies the vegetation, more especially the corn, which dies in\r\nwinter to revive in spring; only whereas the Oriental imagination\r\nfigured the loved and lost one as a dead lover or a dead husband\r\nlamented by his leman or his wife, Greek fancy embodied the same\r\nidea in the tenderer and purer form of a dead daughter bewailed by\r\nher sorrowing mother.\r\n\r\nThe oldest literary document which narrates the myth of Demeter and\r\nPersephone is the beautiful Homeric _Hymn to Demeter,_ which critics\r\nassign to the seventh century before our era. The object of the poem\r\nis to explain the origin of the Eleusinian mysteries, and the\r\ncomplete silence of the poet as to Athens and the Athenians, who in\r\nafter ages took conspicuous part in the festival, renders it\r\nprobable that the hymn was composed in the far off time when Eleusis\r\nwas still a petty independent state, and before the stately\r\nprocession of the Mysteries had begun to defile, in bright September\r\ndays, over the low chain of barren rocky hills which divides the\r\nflat Eleusinian cornland from the more spacious olive-clad expanse\r\nof the Athenian plain. Be that as it may, the hymn reveals to us the\r\nconception which the writer entertained of the character and\r\nfunctions of the two goddesses; their natural shapes stand out\r\nsharply enough under the thin veil of poetical imagery. The youthful\r\nPersephone, so runs the tale, was gathering roses and lilies,\r\ncrocuses and violets, hyacinths and narcissuses in a lush meadow,\r\nwhen the earth gaped and Pluto, lord of the Dead, issuing from the\r\nabyss carried her off on his golden car to be his bride and queen in\r\nthe gloomy subterranean world. Her sorrowing mother Demeter, with\r\nher yellow tresses veiled in a dark mourning mantle, sought her over\r\nland and sea, and learning from the Sun her daughter\'s fate she\r\nwithdrew in high dudgeon from the gods and took up her abode at\r\nEleusis, where she presented herself to the king\'s daughters in the\r\nguise of an old woman, sitting sadly under the shadow of an olive\r\ntree beside the Maiden\'s Well, to which the damsels had come to draw\r\nwater in bronze pitchers for their father\'s house. In her wrath at\r\nher bereavement the goddess suffered not the seed to grow in the\r\nearth but kept it hidden under ground, and she vowed that never\r\nwould she set foot on Olympus and never would she let the corn\r\nsprout till her lost daughter should be restored to her. Vainly the\r\noxen dragged the ploughs to and fro in the fields; vainly the sower\r\ndropped the barley seed in the brown furrows; nothing came up from\r\nthe parched and crumbling soil. Even the Rarian plain near Eleusis,\r\nwhich was wont to wave with yellow harvests, lay bare and fallow.\r\nMankind would have perished of hunger and the gods would have been\r\nrobbed of the sacrifices which were their due, if Zeus in alarm had\r\nnot commanded Pluto to disgorge his prey, to restore his bride\r\nPersephone to her mother Demeter. The grim lord of the Dead smiled\r\nand obeyed, but before he sent back his queen to the upper air on a\r\ngolden car, he gave her the seed of a pomegranate to eat, which\r\nensured that she would return to him. But Zeus stipulated that\r\nhenceforth Persephone should spend two thirds of every year with her\r\nmother and the gods in the upper world and one third of the year\r\nwith her husband in the nether world, from which she was to return\r\nyear by year when the earth was gay with spring flowers. Gladly the\r\ndaughter then returned to the sunshine, gladly her mother received\r\nher and fell upon her neck; and in her joy at recovering the lost\r\none Demeter made the corn to sprout from the clods of the ploughed\r\nfields and all the broad earth to be heavy with leaves and blossoms.\r\nAnd straightway she went and showed this happy sight to the princes\r\nof Eleusis, to Triptolemus, Eumolpus, Diocles, and to the king\r\nCeleus himself, and moreover she revealed to them her sacred rites\r\nand mysteries. Blessed, says the poet, is the mortal man who has\r\nseen these things, but he who has had no share of them in life will\r\nnever be happy in death when he has descended into the darkness of\r\nthe grave. So the two goddesses departed to dwell in bliss with the\r\ngods on Olympus; and the bard ends the hymn with a pious prayer to\r\nDemeter and Persephone that they would be pleased to grant him a\r\nlivelihood in return for his song.\r\n\r\nIt has been generally recognised, and indeed it seems scarcely open\r\nto doubt, that the main theme which the poet set before himself in\r\ncomposing this hymn was to describe the traditional foundation of\r\nthe Eleusinian mysteries by the goddess Demeter. The whole poem\r\nleads up to the transformation scene in which the bare leafless\r\nexpanse of the Eleusinian plain is suddenly turned, at the will of\r\nthe goddess, into a vast sheet of ruddy corn; the beneficent deity\r\ntakes the princes of Eleusis, shows them what she has done, teaches\r\nthem her mystic rites, and vanishes with her daughter to heaven. The\r\nrevelation of the mysteries is the triumphal close of the piece.\r\nThis conclusion is confirmed by a more minute examination of the\r\npoem, which proves that the poet has given, not merely a general\r\naccount of the foundation of the mysteries, but also in more or less\r\nveiled language mythical explanations of the origin of particular\r\nrites which we have good reason to believe formed essential features\r\nof the festival. Amongst the rites as to which the poet thus drops\r\nsignificant hints are the preliminary fast of the candidates for\r\ninitiation, the torchlight procession, the all-night vigil, the\r\nsitting of the candidates, veiled and in silence, on stools covered\r\nwith sheepskins, the use of scurrilous language, the breaking of\r\nribald jests, and the solemn communion with the divinity by\r\nparticipation in a draught of barley-water from a holy chalice.\r\n\r\nBut there is yet another and a deeper secret of the mysteries which\r\nthe author of the poem appears to have divulged under cover of his\r\nnarrative. He tells us how, as soon as she had transformed the\r\nbarren brown expanse of the Eleusinian plain into a field of golden\r\ngrain, she gladdened the eyes of Triptolemus and the other\r\nEleusinian princes by showing them the growing or standing corn.\r\nWhen we compare this part of the story with the statement of a\r\nChristian writer of the second century, Hippolytus, that the very\r\nheart of the mysteries consisted in showing to the initiated a\r\nreaped ear of corn, we can hardly doubt that the poet of the hymn\r\nwas well acquainted with this solemn rite, and that he deliberately\r\nintended to explain its origin in precisely the same way as he\r\nexplained other rites of the mysteries, namely by representing\r\nDemeter as having set the example of performing the ceremony in her\r\nown person. Thus myth and ritual mutually explain and confirm each\r\nother. The poet of the seventh century before our era gives us the\r\nmyth--he could not without sacrilege have revealed the ritual: the\r\nChristian father reveals the ritual, and his revelation accords\r\nperfectly with the veiled hint of the old poet. On the whole, then,\r\nwe may, with many modern scholars, confidently accept the statement\r\nof the learned Christian father Clement of Alexandria, that the myth\r\nof Demeter and Persephone was acted as a sacred drama in the\r\nmysteries of Eleusis.\r\n\r\nBut if the myth was acted as a part, perhaps as the principal part,\r\nof the most famous and solemn religious rites of ancient Greece, we\r\nhave still to enquire, What was, after all, stripped of later\r\naccretions, the original kernel of the myth which appears to later\r\nages surrounded and transfigured by an aureole of awe and mystery,\r\nlit up by some of the most brilliant rays of Grecian literature and\r\nart? If we follow the indications given by our oldest literary\r\nauthority on the subject, the author of the Homeric hymn to Demeter,\r\nthe riddle is not hard to read; the figures of the two goddesses,\r\nthe mother and the daughter, resolve themselves into\r\npersonifications of the corn. At least this appears to be fairly\r\ncertain for the daughter Persephone. The goddess who spends three\r\nor, according to another version of the myth, six months of every\r\nyear with the dead under ground and the remainder of the year with\r\nthe living above ground; in whose absence the barley seed is hidden\r\nin the earth and the fields lie bare and fallow; on whose return in\r\nspring to the upper world the corn shoots up from the clods and the\r\nearth is heavy with leaves and blossoms--this goddess can surely be\r\nnothing else than a mythical embodiment of the vegetation, and\r\nparticularly of the corn, which is buried under the soil for some\r\nmonths of every winter and comes to life again, as from the grave,\r\nin the sprouting cornstalks and the opening flowers and foliage of\r\nevery spring. No other reasonable and probable explanation of\r\nPersephone seems possible. And if the daughter goddess was a\r\npersonification of the young corn of the present year, may not the\r\nmother goddess be a personification of the old corn of last year,\r\nwhich has given birth to the new crops? The only alternative to this\r\nview of Demeter would seem to be to suppose that she is a\r\npersonification of the earth, from whose broad bosom the corn and\r\nall other plants spring up, and of which accordingly they may\r\nappropriately enough be regarded as the daughters. This view of the\r\noriginal nature of Demeter has indeed been taken by some writers,\r\nboth ancient and modern, and it is one which can be reasonably\r\nmaintained. But it appears to have been rejected by the author of\r\nthe Homeric hymn to Demeter, for he not only distinguishes Demeter\r\nfrom the personified Earth but places the two in the sharpest\r\nopposition to each other. He tells us that it was Earth who, in\r\naccordance with the will of Zeus and to please Pluto, lured\r\nPersephone to her doom by causing the narcissuses to grow which\r\ntempted the young goddess to stray far beyond the reach of help in\r\nthe lush meadow. Thus Demeter of the hymn, far from being identical\r\nwith the Earth-goddess, must have regarded that divinity as her\r\nworst enemy, since it was to her insidious wiles that she owed the\r\nloss of her daughter. But if the Demeter of the hymn cannot have\r\nbeen a personification of the earth, the only alternative apparently\r\nis to conclude that she was a personification of the corn.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is confirmed by the monuments; for in ancient art\r\nDemeter and Persephone are alike characterised as goddesses of the\r\ncorn by the crowns of corn which they wear on their heads and by the\r\nstalks of corn which they hold in their hands. Again, it was Demeter\r\nwho first revealed to the Athenians the secret of the corn and\r\ndiffused the beneficent discovery far and wide through the agency of\r\nTriptolemus, whom she sent forth as an itinerant missionary to\r\ncommunicate the boon to all mankind. On monuments of art, especially\r\nin vase-paintings, he is constantly represented along with Demeter\r\nin this capacity, holding corn-stalks in his hand and sitting in his\r\ncar, which is sometimes winged and sometimes drawn by dragons, and\r\nfrom which he is said to have sowed the seed down on the whole world\r\nas he sped through the air. In gratitude for the priceless boon many\r\nGreek cities long continued to send the first-fruits of their barley\r\nand wheat harvests as thank-offerings to the Two Goddesses, Demeter\r\nand Persephone, at Eleusis, where subterranean granaries were built\r\nto store the overflowing contributions. Theocritus tells how in the\r\nisland of Cos, in the sweet-scented summer time, the farmer brought\r\nthe first-fruits of the harvest to Demeter who had filled his\r\nthreshingfloor with barley, and whose rustic image held sheaves and\r\npoppies in her hands. Many of the epithets bestowed by the ancients\r\non Demeter mark her intimate association with the corn in the\r\nclearest manner.\r\n\r\nHow deeply implanted in the mind of the ancient Greeks was this\r\nfaith in Demeter as goddess of the corn may be judged by the\r\ncircumstance that the faith actually persisted among their Christian\r\ndescendants at her old sanctuary of Eleusis down to the beginning of\r\nthe nineteenth century. For when the English traveller Dodwell\r\nrevisited Eleusis, the inhabitants lamented to him the loss of a\r\ncolossal image of Demeter, which was carried off by Clarke in 1802\r\nand presented to the University of Cambridge, where it still\r\nremains. "In my first journey to Greece," says Dodwell, "this\r\nprotecting deity was in its full glory, situated in the centre of a\r\nthreshing-floor, amongst the ruins of her temple. The villagers were\r\nimpressed with a persuasion that their rich harvests were the effect\r\nof her bounty, and since her removal, their abundance, as they\r\nassured me, has disappeared." Thus we see the Corn Goddess Demeter\r\nstanding on the threshing-floor of Eleusis and dispensing corn to\r\nher worshippers in the nineteenth century of the Christian era,\r\nprecisely as her image stood and dispensed corn to her worshippers\r\non the threshing-floor of Cos in the days of Theocritus. And just as\r\nthe people of Eleusis in the nineteenth century attributed the\r\ndiminution of their harvests to the loss of the image of Demeter, so\r\nin antiquity the Sicilians, a corn-growing people devoted to the\r\nworship of the two Corn Goddesses, lamented that the crops of many\r\ntowns had perished because the unscrupulous Roman governor Verres\r\nhad impiously carried off the image of Demeter from her famous\r\ntemple at Henna. Could we ask for a clearer proof that Demeter was\r\nindeed the goddess of the corn than this belief, held by the Greeks\r\ndown to modern times, that the corn-crops depended on her presence\r\nand bounty and perished when her image was removed?\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, if, ignoring theories, we adhere to the evidence\r\nof the ancients themselves in regard to the rites of Eleusis, we\r\nshall probably incline to agree with the most learned of ancient\r\nantiquaries, the Roman Varro, who, to quote Augustine\'s report of\r\nhis opinion, "interpreted the whole of the Eleusinian mysteries as\r\nrelating to the corn which Ceres (Demeter) had discovered, and to\r\nProserpine (Persephone), whom Pluto had carried off from her. And\r\nProserpine herself he said, signifies the fecundity of the seeds,\r\nthe failure of which at a certain time had caused the earth to mourn\r\nfor barrenness, and therefore had given rise to the opinion that the\r\ndaughter of Ceres, that is, fecundity itself, had been ravished by\r\nPluto and detained in the nether world; and when the dearth had been\r\npublicly mourned and fecundity had returned once more, there was\r\ngladness at the return of Proserpine and solemn rites were\r\ninstituted accordingly. After that he says," continues Augustine,\r\nreporting Varro, "that many things were taught in her mysteries\r\nwhich had no reference but to the discovery of the corn."\r\n\r\nThus far I have for the most part assumed an identity of nature\r\nbetween Demeter and Persephone, the divine mother and daughter\r\npersonifying the corn in its double aspect of the seed-corn of last\r\nyear and the ripe ears of this, and this view of the substantial\r\nunity of mother and daughter is borne out by their portraits in\r\nGreek art, which are often so alike as to be indistinguishable. Such\r\na close resemblance between the artistic types of Demeter and\r\nPersephone militates decidedly against the view that the two\r\ngoddesses are mythical embodiments of two things so different and so\r\neasily distinguishable from each other as the earth and the\r\nvegetation which springs from it. Had Greek artists accepted that\r\nview of Demeter and Persephone, they could surely have devised types\r\nof them which would have brought out the deep distinction between\r\nthe goddesses. And if Demeter did not personify the earth, can there\r\nbe any reasonable doubt that, like her daughter, she personified the\r\ncorn which was so commonly called by her name from the time of Homer\r\ndownwards? The essential identity of mother and daughter is\r\nsuggested, not only by the close resemblance of their artistic\r\ntypes, but also by the official title of "the Two Goddesses" which\r\nwas regularly applied to them in the great sanctuary at Eleusis\r\nwithout any specification of their individual attributes and titles,\r\nas if their separate individualities had almost merged in a single\r\ndivine substance.\r\n\r\nSurveying the evidence as a whole, we are fairly entitled to\r\nconclude that in the mind of the ordinary Greek the two goddesses\r\nwere essentially personifications of the corn, and that in this germ\r\nthe whole efflorescence of their religion finds implicitly its\r\nexplanation. But to maintain this is not to deny that in the long\r\ncourse of religious evolution high moral and spiritual conceptions\r\nwere grafted on this simple original stock and blossomed out into\r\nfairer flowers than the bloom of the barley and the wheat. Above\r\nall, the thought of the seed buried in the earth in order to spring\r\nup to new and higher life readily suggested a comparison with human\r\ndestiny, and strengthened the hope that for man too the grave may be\r\nbut the beginning of a better and happier existence in some brighter\r\nworld unknown. This simple and natural reflection seems perfectly\r\nsufficient to explain the association of the Corn Goddess at Eleusis\r\nwith the mystery of death and the hope of a blissful immortality.\r\nFor that the ancients regarded initiation in the Eleusinian\r\nmysteries as a key to unlock the gates of Paradise appears to be\r\nproved by the allusions which well-informed writers among them drop\r\nto the happiness in store for the initiated hereafter. No doubt it\r\nis easy for us to discern the flimsiness of the logical foundation\r\non which such high hopes were built. But drowning men clutch at\r\nstraws, and we need not wonder that the Greeks, like ourselves, with\r\ndeath before them and a great love of life in their hearts, should\r\nnot have stopped to weigh with too nice a hand the arguments that\r\ntold for and against the prospect of human immortality. The\r\nreasoning that satisfied Saint Paul and has brought comfort to\r\nuntold thousands of sorrowing Christians, standing by the deathbed\r\nor the open grave of their loved ones, was good enough to pass\r\nmuster with ancient pagans, when they too bowed their heads under\r\nthe burden of grief, and, with the taper of life burning low in the\r\nsocket, looked forward into the darkness of the unknown. Therefore\r\nwe do no indignity to the myth of Demeter and Persephone--one of the\r\nfew myths in which the sunshine and clarity of the Greek genius are\r\ncrossed by the shadow and mystery of death--when we trace its origin\r\nto some of the most familiar, yet eternally affecting aspects of\r\nnature, to the melancholy gloom and decay of autumn and to the\r\nfreshness, the brightness, and the verdure of spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV. The Corn-Mother and the Corn-Maiden in Northern Europe\r\n\r\nIT has been argued by W. Mannhardt that the first part of Demeter\'s\r\nname is derived from an alleged Cretan word _deai,_ "barley," and\r\nthat accordingly Demeter means neither more nor less than\r\n"Barley-mother" or "Corn-mother"; for the root of the word seems to\r\nhave been applied to different kinds of grain by different branches\r\nof the Aryans. As Crete appears to have been one of the most ancient\r\nseats of the worship of Demeter, it would not be surprising if her\r\nname were of Cretan origin. But the etymology is open to serious\r\nobjections, and it is safer therefore to lay no stress on it. Be\r\nthat as it may, we have found independent reasons for identifying\r\nDemeter as the Corn-mother, and of the two species of corn\r\nassociated with her in Greek religion, namely barley and wheat, the\r\nbarley has perhaps the better claim to be her original element; for\r\nnot only would it seem to have been the staple food of the Greeks in\r\nthe Homeric age, but there are grounds for believing that it is one\r\nof the oldest, if not the very oldest, cereal cultivated by the\r\nAryan race. Certainly the use of barley in the religious ritual of\r\nthe ancient Hindoos as well as of the ancient Greeks furnishes a\r\nstrong argument in favour of the great antiquity of its cultivation,\r\nwhich is known to have been practised by the lake-dwellers of the\r\nStone Age in Europe.\r\n\r\nAnalogies to the Corn-mother or Barley-mother of ancient Greece have\r\nbeen collected in great abundance by W. Mannhardt from the folk-lore\r\nof modern Europe. The following may serve as specimens.\r\n\r\nIn Germany the corn is very commonly personified under the name of\r\nthe Corn-mother. Thus in spring, when the corn waves in the wind,\r\nthe peasants say, "There comes the Corn-mother," or "The Corn-mother\r\nis running over the field," or "The Corn-mother is going through the\r\ncorn." When children wish to go into the fields to pull the blue\r\ncorn-flowers or the red poppies, they are told not to do so, because\r\nthe Corn-mother is sitting in the corn and will catch them. Or again\r\nshe is called, according to the crop, the Rye-mother or the\r\nPea-mother, and children are warned against straying in the rye or\r\namong the peas by threats of the Rye-mother or the Pea-mother. Again\r\nthe Corn-mother is believed to make the crop grow. Thus in the\r\nneighbourhood of Magdeburg it is sometimes said, "It will be a good\r\nyear for flax; the Flax-mother has been seen." In a village of\r\nStyria it is said that the Corn-mother, in the shape of a female\r\npuppet made out of the last sheaf of corn and dressed in white, may\r\nbe seen at mid-night in the corn-fields, which she fertilises by\r\npassing through them; but if she is angry with a farmer, she withers\r\nup all his corn.\r\n\r\nFurther, the Corn-mother plays an important part in harvest customs.\r\nShe is believed to be present in the handful of corn which is left\r\nstanding last on the field; and with the cutting of this last\r\nhandful she is caught, or driven away, or killed. In the first of\r\nthese cases, the last sheaf is carried joyfully home and honoured as\r\na divine being. It is placed in the barn, and at threshing the\r\ncorn-spirit appears again. In the Hanoverian district of Hadeln the\r\nreapers stand round the last sheaf and beat it with sticks in order\r\nto drive the Corn-mother out of it. They call to each other, "There\r\nshe is! hit her! Take care she doesn\'t catch you!" The beating goes\r\non till the grain is completely threshed out; then the Corn-mother\r\nis believed to be driven away. In the neighbourhood of Danzig the\r\nperson who cuts the last ears of corn makes them into a doll, which\r\nis called the Corn-mother or the Old Woman and is brought home on\r\nthe last waggon. In some parts of Holstein the last sheaf is dressed\r\nin woman\'s clothes and called the Corn-mother. It is carried home on\r\nthe last waggon, and then thoroughly drenched with water. The\r\ndrenching with water is doubtless a rain-charm. In the district of\r\nBruck in Styria the last sheaf, called the Corn-mother, is made up\r\ninto the shape of a woman by the oldest married woman in the\r\nvillage, of an age from fifty to fifty-five years. The finest ears\r\nare plucked out of it and made into a wreath, which, twined with\r\nflowers, is carried on her head by the prettiest girl of the village\r\nto the farmer or squire, while the Corn-mother is laid down in the\r\nbarn to keep off the mice. In other villages of the same district\r\nthe Corn-mother, at the close of harvest, is carried by two lads at\r\nthe top of a pole. They march behind the girl who wears the wreath\r\nto the squire\'s house, and while he receives the wreath and hangs it\r\nup in the hall, the Corn-mother is placed on the top of a pile of\r\nwood, where she is the centre of the harvest supper and dance.\r\nAfterwards she is hung up in the barn and remains there till the\r\nthreshing is over. The man who gives the last stroke at threshing is\r\ncalled the son of the Corn-mother; he is tied up in the Corn-mother,\r\nbeaten, and carried through the village. The wreath is dedicated in\r\nchurch on the following Sunday; and on Easter Eve the grain is\r\nrubbed out of it by a seven-year-old girl and scattered amongst the\r\nyoung corn. At Christmas the straw of the wreath is placed in the\r\nmanger to make the cattle thrive. Here the fertilising power of the\r\nCorn-mother is plainly brought out by scattering the seed taken from\r\nher body (for the wreath is made out of the Corn-mother) among the\r\nnew corn; and her influence over animal life is indicated by placing\r\nthe straw in the manger. Amongst the Slavs also the last sheaf is\r\nknown as the Rye-mother, the Wheat-mother, the Oats-mother, the\r\nBarley-mother, and so on, according to the crop. In the district of\r\nTarnow, Galicia, the wreath made out of the last stalks is called\r\nthe Wheat-mother, Rye-mother, or Pea-mother. It is placed on a\r\ngirl\'s head and kept till spring, when some of the grain is mixed\r\nwith the seed-corn. Here again the fertilising power of the\r\nCorn-mother is indicated. In France, also, in the neighbourhood of\r\nAuxerre, the last sheaf goes by the name of the Mother of the Wheat,\r\nMother of the Barley, Mother of the Rye, or Mother of the Oats. They\r\nleave it standing in the field till the last waggon is about to wend\r\nhomewards. Then they make a puppet out of it, dress it with clothes\r\nbelonging to the farmer, and adorn it with a crown and a blue or\r\nwhite scarf. A branch of a tree is stuck in the breast of the\r\npuppet, which is now called the Ceres. At the dance in the evening\r\nthe Ceres is set in the middle of the floor, and the reaper who\r\nreaped fastest dances round it with the prettiest girl for his\r\npartner. After the dance a pyre is made. All the girls, each wearing\r\na wreath, strip the puppet, pull it to pieces, and place it on the\r\npyre, along with the flowers with which it was adorned. Then the\r\ngirl who was the first to finish reaping sets fire to the pile, and\r\nall pray that Ceres may give a fruitful year. Here, as Mannhardt\r\nobserves, the old custom has remained intact, though the name Ceres\r\nis a bit of schoolmaster\'s learning. In Upper Brittany the last\r\nsheaf is always made into human shape; but if the farmer is a\r\nmarried man, it is made double and consists of a little corn-puppet\r\nplaced inside of a large one. This is called the Mother-sheaf. It is\r\ndelivered to the farmer\'s wife, who unties it and gives drink-money\r\nin return.\r\n\r\nSometimes the last sheaf is called, not the Corn-mother, but the\r\nHarvest-mother or the Great Mother. In the province of Osnabr\xfcck,\r\nHanover, it is called the Harvest-mother; it is made up in female\r\nform, and then the reapers dance about with it. In some parts of\r\nWestphalia the last sheaf at the rye-harvest is made especially\r\nheavy by fastening stones in it. They bring it home on the last\r\nwaggon and call it the Great Mother, though they do not fashion it\r\ninto any special shape. In the district of Erfurt a very heavy\r\nsheaf, not necessarily the last, is called the Great Mother, and is\r\ncarried on the last waggon to the barn, where all hands lift it down\r\namid a fire of jokes.\r\n\r\nSometimes again the last sheaf is called the Grandmother, and is\r\nadorned with flowers, ribbons, and a woman\'s apron. In East Prussia,\r\nat the rye or wheat harvest, the reapers call out to the woman who\r\nbinds the last sheaf, "You are getting the Old Grandmother." In the\r\nneighbourhood of Magdeburg the men and women servants strive who\r\nshall get the last sheaf, called the Grandmother. Whoever gets it\r\nwill be married in the next year, but his or her spouse will be old;\r\nif a girl gets it, she will marry a widower; if a man gets it, he\r\nwill marry an old crone. In Silesia the Grandmother--a huge bundle\r\nmade up of three or four sheaves by the person who tied the last\r\nsheaf--was formerly fashioned into a rude likeness of the human\r\nform. In the neighbourhood of Belfast the last sheaf sometimes goes\r\nby the name of the Granny. It is not cut in the usual way, but all\r\nthe reapers throw their sickles at it and try to bring it down. It\r\nis plaited and kept till the (next?) autumn. Whoever gets it will\r\nmarry in the course of the year.\r\n\r\nOften the last sheaf is called the Old Woman or the Old Man. In\r\nGermany it is frequently shaped and dressed as a woman, and the\r\nperson who cuts it or binds it is said to "get the Old Woman." At\r\nAltisheim, in Swabia, when all the corn of a farm has been cut\r\nexcept a single strip, all the reapers stand in a row before the\r\nstrip; each cuts his share rapidly, and he who gives the last cut\r\n"has the Old Woman." When the sheaves are being set up in heaps, the\r\nperson who gets hold of the Old Woman, which is the largest and\r\nthickest of all the sheaves, is jeered at by the rest, who call out\r\nto him, "He has the Old Woman and must keep her." The woman who\r\nbinds the last sheaf is sometimes herself called the Old Woman, and\r\nit is said that she will be married in the next year. In Neusaass,\r\nWest Prussia, both the last sheaf--which is dressed up in jacket,\r\nhat, and ribbons--and the woman who binds it are called the Old\r\nWoman. Together they are brought home on the last waggon and are\r\ndrenched with water. In various parts of North Germany the last\r\nsheaf at harvest is made up into a human effigy and called "the Old\r\nMan"; and the woman who bound it is said "to have the Old Man."\r\n\r\nIn West Prussia, when the last rye is being raked together, the\r\nwomen and girls hurry with the work, for none of them likes to be\r\nthe last and to get "the Old Man," that is, a puppet made out of the\r\nlast sheaf, which must be carried before the other reapers by the\r\nperson who was the last to finish. In Silesia the last sheaf is\r\ncalled the Old Woman or the Old Man and is the theme of many jests;\r\nit is made unusually large and is sometimes weighted with a stone.\r\nAmong the Wends the man or woman who binds the last sheaf at wheat\r\nharvest is said to "have the Old Man." A puppet is made out of the\r\nwheaten straw and ears in the likeness of a man and decked with\r\nflowers. The person who bound the last sheaf must carry the Old Man\r\nhome, while the rest laugh and jeer at him. The puppet is hung up in\r\nthe farmhouse and remains till a new Old Man is made at the next\r\nharvest.\r\n\r\nIn some of these customs, as Mannhardt has remarked, the person who\r\nis called by the same name as the last sheaf and sits beside it on\r\nthe last waggon is obviously identified with it; he or she\r\nrepresents the corn-spirit which has been caught in the last sheaf;\r\nin other words, the corn-spirit is represented in duplicate, by a\r\nhuman being and by a sheaf. The identification of the person with\r\nthe sheaf is made still clearer by the custom of wrapping up in the\r\nlast sheaf the person who cuts or binds it. Thus at Hermsdorf in\r\nSilesia it used to be the regular practice to tie up in the last\r\nsheaf the woman who had bound it. At Weiden, in Bavaria, it is the\r\ncutter, not the binder, of the last sheaf who is tied up in it. Here\r\nthe person wrapt up in the corn represents the corn-spirit, exactly\r\nas a person wrapt in branches or leaves represents the tree-spirit.\r\n\r\nThe last sheaf, designated as the Old Woman, is often distinguished\r\nfrom the other sheaves by its size and weight. Thus in some villages\r\nof West Prussia the Old Woman is made twice as long and thick as a\r\ncommon sheaf, and a stone is fastened in the middle of it. Sometimes\r\nit is made so heavy that a man can barely lift it. At Alt-Pillau, in\r\nSamland, eight or nine sheaves are often tied together to make the\r\nOld Woman, and the man who sets it up grumbles at its weight. At\r\nItzgrund, in Saxe-Coburg, the last sheaf, called the Old Woman, is\r\nmade large with the express intention of thereby securing a good\r\ncrop next year. Thus the custom of making the last sheaf unusually\r\nlarge or heavy is a charm, working by sympathetic magic, to ensure a\r\nlarge and heavy crop at the following harvest.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, when the last corn was cut after Hallowmas, the female\r\nfigure made out of it was sometimes called the Carlin or Carline,\r\nthat is, the Old Woman. But if cut before Hallowmas, it was called\r\nthe Maiden; if cut after sunset, it was called the Witch, being\r\nsupposed to bring bad luck. Among the Highlanders of Scotland the\r\nlast corn cut at harvest is known either as the Old Wife\r\n(_Cailleach_) or as the Maiden; on the whole the former name seems\r\nto prevail in the western and the latter in the central and eastern\r\ndistricts. Of the Maiden we shall speak presently; here we are\r\ndealing with the Old Wife. The following general account of the\r\ncustom is given by a careful and well-informed enquirer, the Rev. J.\r\nG. Campbell, minister of the remote Hebridean island of Tiree: "The\r\nHarvest Old Wife (_a Cailleach_).--In harvest, there was a struggle\r\nto escape from being the last done with the shearing, and when\r\ntillage in common existed, instances were known of a ridge being\r\nleft unshorn (no person would claim it) because of it being behind\r\nthe rest. The fear entertained was that of having the \'famine of the\r\nfarm\' (_gort a bhaile_), in the shape of an imaginary old woman\r\n(_cailleach_), to feed till next harvest. Much emulation and\r\namusement arose from the fear of this old woman. . . . The first\r\ndone made a doll of some blades of corn, which was called the \'old\r\nwife,\' and sent it to his nearest neighbour. He in turn, when ready,\r\npassed it to another still less expeditious, and the person it last\r\nremained with had \'the old woman\' to keep for that year."\r\n\r\nIn the island of Islay the last corn cut goes by the name of the Old\r\nWife (_Cailleach_), and when she has done her duty at harvest she is\r\nhung up on the wall and stays there till the time comes to plough\r\nthe fields for the next year\'s crop. Then she is taken down, and on\r\nthe first day when the men go to plough she is divided among them by\r\nthe mistress of the house. They take her in their pockets and give\r\nher to the horses to eat when they reach the field. This is supposed\r\nto secure good luck for the next harvest, and is understood to be\r\nthe proper end of the Old Wife.\r\n\r\nUsages of the same sort are reported from Wales. Thus in North\r\nPembrokeshire a tuft of the last corn cut, from six to twelve inches\r\nlong, is plaited and goes by the name of the Hag (_wrach_); and\r\nquaint old customs used to be practised with it within the memory of\r\nmany persons still alive. Great was the excitement among the reapers\r\nwhen the last patch of standing corn was reached. All in turn threw\r\ntheir sickles at it, and the one who succeeded in cutting it\r\nreceived a jug of home-brewed ale. The Hag (_wrach_) was then\r\nhurriedly made and taken to a neighbouring farm, where the reapers\r\nwere still busy at their work. This was generally done by the\r\nploughman; but he had to be very careful not to be observed by his\r\nneighbours, for if they saw him coming and had the least suspicion\r\nof his errand they would soon make him retrace his steps. Creeping\r\nstealthily up behind a fence he waited till the foreman of his\r\nneighbour\'s reapers was just opposite him and within easy reach.\r\nThen he suddenly threw the Hag over the fence and, if possible, upon\r\nthe foreman\'s sickle. On that he took to his heels and made off as\r\nfast as he could run, and he was a lucky man if he escaped without\r\nbeing caught or cut by the flying sickles which the infuriated\r\nreapers hurled after him. In other cases the Hag was brought home to\r\nthe farmhouse by one of the reapers. He did his best to bring it\r\nhome dry and without being observed; but he was apt to be roughly\r\nhandled by the people of the house, if they suspected his errand.\r\nSometimes they stripped him of most of his clothes, sometimes they\r\nwould drench him with water which had been carefully stored in\r\nbuckets and pans for the purpose. If, however, he succeeded in\r\nbringing the Hag in dry and unobserved, the master of the house had\r\nto pay him a small fine; or sometimes a jug of beer "from the cask\r\nnext to the wall," which seems to have commonly held the best beer,\r\nwould be demanded by the bearer. The Hag was then carefully hung on\r\na nail in the hall or elsewhere and kept there all the year. The\r\ncustom of bringing in the Hag (_wrach_) into the house and hanging\r\nit up still exists in some farms of North Pembrokeshire, but the\r\nancient ceremonies which have just been described are now\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\nIn County Antrim, down to some years ago, when the sickle was\r\nfinally expelled by the reaping machine, the few stalks of corn left\r\nstanding last on the field were plaited together; then the reapers,\r\nblindfolded, threw their sickles at the plaited corn, and whoever\r\nhappened to cut it through took it home with him and put it over his\r\ndoor. This bunch of corn was called the Carley--probably the same\r\nword as Carlin.\r\n\r\nSimilar customs are observed by Slavonic peoples. Thus in Poland the\r\nlast sheaf is commonly called the Baba, that is, the Old Woman. "In\r\nthe last sheaf," it is said, "sits the Baba." The sheaf itself is\r\nalso called the Baba, and is sometimes composed of twelve smaller\r\nsheaves lashed together. In some parts of Bohemia the Baba, made out\r\nof the last sheaf, has the figure of a woman with a great straw hat.\r\nIt is carried home on the last harvest-waggon and delivered, along\r\nwith a garland, to the farmer by two girls. In binding the sheaves\r\nthe women strive not to be last, for she who binds the last sheaf\r\nwill have a child next year. Sometimes the harvesters call out to\r\nthe woman who binds the last sheaf, "She has the Baba," or "She is\r\nthe Baba." In the district of Cracow, when a man binds the last\r\nsheaf, they say, "The Grandfather is sitting in it"; when a woman\r\nbinds it, they say, "The Baba is sitting in it," and the woman\r\nherself is wrapt up in the sheaf, so that only her head projects out\r\nof it. Thus encased in the sheaf, she is carried on the last\r\nharvest-waggon to the house, where she is drenched with water by the\r\nwhole family. She remains in the sheaf till the dance is over, and\r\nfor a year she retains the name of Baba.\r\n\r\nIn Lithuania the name for the last sheaf is Boba (Old Woman),\r\nanswering to the Polish name Baba. The Boba is said to sit in the\r\ncorn which is left standing last. The person who binds the last\r\nsheaf or digs the last potato is the subject of much banter, and\r\nreceives and long retains the name of the Old Rye-woman or the Old\r\nPotato-woman. The last sheaf--the Boba--is made into the form of a\r\nwoman, carried solemnly through the village on the last\r\nharvest-waggon, and drenched with water at the farmer\'s house; then\r\nevery one dances with it.\r\n\r\nIn Russia also the last sheaf is often shaped and dressed as a\r\nwoman, and carried with dance and song to the farmhouse. Out of the\r\nlast sheaf the Bulgarians make a doll which they call the Corn-queen\r\nor Corn-mother; it is dressed in a woman\'s shirt, carried round the\r\nvillage, and then thrown into the river in order to secure plenty of\r\nrain and dew for the next year\'s crop. Or it is burned and the ashes\r\nstrew on the fields, doubtless to fertilise them. The name Queen, as\r\napplied to the last sheaf, has its analogies in Central and Northern\r\nEurope. Thus, in the Salzburg district of Austria, at the end of the\r\nharvest a great procession takes place, in which a Queen of the\r\nCorn-ears (_\xc4hrenk\xf6nigin_) is drawn along in a little carriage by\r\nyoung fellows. The custom of the Harvest Queen appears to have been\r\ncommon in England. Milton must have been familiar with it, for in\r\n_Paradise Lost_ he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "Adam the while\r\n    Waiting desirous her return, had wove\r\n    Of choicest flow\'rs a garland to adorn\r\n    Her tresses, and her rural labours crown,\r\n    As reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen."\r\n\r\n\r\nOften customs of this sort are practised, not on the harvest-field\r\nbut on the threshing-floor. The spirit of the corn, fleeing before\r\nthe reapers as they cut down the ripe grain, quits the reaped corn\r\nand takes refuge in the barn, where it appears in the last sheaf\r\nthreshed, either to perish under the blows of the flail or to flee\r\nthence to the still unthreshed corn of a neighbouring farm. Thus the\r\nlast corn to be threshed is called the Mother-Corn or the Old Woman.\r\nSometimes the person who gives the last stroke with the flail is\r\ncalled the Old Woman, and is wrapt in the straw of the last sheaf,\r\nor has a bundle of straw fastened on his back. Whether wrapt in the\r\nstraw or carrying it on his back, he is carted through the village\r\namid general laughter. In some districts of Bavaria, Th\xfcringen, and\r\nelsewhere, the man who threshes the last sheaf is said to have the\r\nOld Woman or the Old Corn-woman; he is tied up in straw, carried or\r\ncarted about the village, and set down at last on the dunghill, or\r\ntaken to the threshing-floor of a neighbouring farmer who has not\r\nfinished his threshing. In Poland the man who gives the last stroke\r\nat threshing is called Baba (Old Woman); he is wrapt in corn and\r\nwheeled through the village. Sometimes in Lithuania the last sheaf\r\nis not threshed, but is fashioned into female shape and carried to\r\nthe barn of a neighbour who has not finished his threshing.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Sweden, when a stranger woman appears on the\r\nthreshing-floor, a flail is put round her body, stalks of corn are\r\nwound round her neck, a crown of ears is placed on her head, and the\r\nthreshers call out, "Behold the Corn-woman." Here the stranger\r\nwoman, thus suddenly appearing, is taken to be the corn-spirit who\r\nhas just been expelled by the flails from the corn-stalks. In other\r\ncases the farmer\'s wife represents the corn-spirit. Thus in the\r\nCommune of Salign\xe9 (Vend\xe9e), the farmer\'s wife, along with the last\r\nsheaf, is tied up in a sheet, placed on a litter, and carried to the\r\nthreshing machine, under which she is shoved. Then the woman is\r\ndrawn out and the sheaf is threshed by itself, but the woman is\r\ntossed in the sheet, as if she were being winnowed. It would be\r\nimpossible to express more clearly the identification of the woman\r\nwith the corn than by this graphic imitation of threshing and\r\nwinnowing her.\r\n\r\nIn these customs the spirit of the ripe corn is regarded as old, or\r\nat least as of mature age. Hence the names of Mother, Grandmother,\r\nOld Woman, and so forth. But in other cases the corn-spirit is\r\nconceived as young. Thus at Saldern, near Wolfenbuttel, when the rye\r\nhas been reaped, three sheaves are tied together with a rope so as\r\nto make a puppet with the corn ears for a head. This puppet is\r\ncalled the Maiden or the Corn-maiden. Sometimes the corn-spirit is\r\nconceived as a child who is separated from its mother by the stroke\r\nof the sickle. This last view appears in the Polish custom of\r\ncalling out to the man who cuts the last handful of corn, "You have\r\ncut the navel-string." In some districts of West Prussia the figure\r\nmade out of the last sheaf is called the Bastard, and a boy is wrapt\r\nup in it. The woman who binds the last sheaf and represents the\r\nCorn-mother is told that she is about to be brought to bed; she\r\ncries like a woman in travail, and an old woman in the character of\r\ngrandmother acts as midwife. At last a cry is raised that the child\r\nis born; whereupon the boy who is tied up in the sheaf whimpers and\r\nsqualls like an infant. The grandmother wraps a sack, in imitation\r\nof swaddling bands, round the pretended baby, who is carried\r\njoyfully to the barn, lest he should catch cold in the open air. In\r\nother parts of North Germany the last sheaf, or the puppet made out\r\nof it, is called the Child, the Harvest-Child, and so on, and they\r\ncall out to the woman who binds the last sheaf, "you are getting the\r\nchild."\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Scotland, as well as in the north of England, the\r\nlast handful of corn cut on the harvest-field was called the _kirn,_\r\nand the person who carried it off was said "to win the kirn." It was\r\nthen dressed up like a child\'s doll and went by the name of the\r\nkirn-baby, the kirn-doll, or the Maiden. In Berwickshire down to\r\nabout the middle of the nineteenth century there was an eager\r\ncompetition among the reapers to cut the last bunch of standing\r\ncorn. They gathered round it at a little distance and threw their\r\nsickles in turn at it, and the man who succeeded in cutting it\r\nthrough gave it to the girl he preferred. She made the corn so cut\r\ninto a kirn-dolly and dressed it, and the doll was then taken to the\r\nfarmhouse and hung up there till the next harvest, when its place\r\nwas taken by the new kirn-dolly. At Spottiswoode in Berwickshire the\r\nreaping of the last corn at harvest was called "cutting the Queen"\r\nalmost as often as "cutting the kirn." The mode of cutting it was\r\nnot by throwing sickles. One of the reapers consented to be\r\nblindfolded, and having been given a sickle in his hand and turned\r\ntwice or thrice about by his fellows, he was bidden to go and cut\r\nthe kirn. His groping about and making wild strokes in the air with\r\nhis sickle excited much hilarity. When he had tired himself out in\r\nvain and given up the task as hopeless, another reaper was\r\nblindfolded and pursued the quest, and so on, one after the other,\r\ntill at last the kirn was cut. The successful reaper was tossed up\r\nin the air with three cheers by his brother harvesters. To decorate\r\nthe room in which the kirn-supper was held at Spottiswoode as well\r\nas the granary, where the dancing took place, two women made\r\nkirn-dollies or Queens every year; and many of these rustic effigies\r\nof the corn-spirit might be seen hanging up together.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the Highlands of Scotland the last handful of corn\r\nthat is cut by the reapers on any particular farm is called the\r\nMaiden, or in Gaelic _Maidhdeanbuain,_ literally, "the shorn\r\nMaiden." Superstitions attach to the winning of the Maiden. If it is\r\ngot by a young person, they think it an omen that he or she will be\r\nmarried before another harvest. For that or other reasons there is a\r\nstrife between the reapers as to who shall get the Maiden, and they\r\nresort to various stratagems for the purpose of securing it. One of\r\nthem, for example, will often leave a handful of corn uncut and\r\ncover it up with earth to hide it from the other reapers, till all\r\nthe rest of the corn on the field is cut down. Several may try to\r\nplay the same trick, and the one who is coolest and holds out\r\nlongest obtains the coveted distinction. When it has been cut, the\r\nMaiden is dressed with ribbons into a sort of doll and affixed to a\r\nwall of the farmhouse. In the north of Scotland the Maiden is\r\ncarefully preserved till Yule morning, when it is divided among the\r\ncattle "to make them thrive all the year round." In the\r\nneighbourhood of Balquhidder, Perthshire, the last handful of corn\r\nis cut by the youngest girl on the field, and is made into the rude\r\nform of a female doll, clad in a paper dress, and decked with\r\nribbons. It is called the Maiden, and is kept in the farmhouse,\r\ngenerally above the chimney, for a good while, sometimes till the\r\nMaiden of the next year is brought in. The writer of this book\r\nwitnessed the ceremony of cutting the Maiden at Balquhidder in\r\nSeptember 1888. A lady friend informed me that as a young girl she\r\ncut the Maiden several times at the request of the reapers in the\r\nneighbourhood of Perth. The name of the Maiden was given to the last\r\nhandful of standing corn; a reaper held the top of the bunch while\r\nshe cut it. Afterwards the bunch was plaited, decked with ribbons,\r\nand hung up in a conspicuous place on the wall of the kitchen till\r\nthe next Maiden was brought in. The harvest-supper in this\r\nneighbourhood was also called the Maiden; the reapers danced at it.\r\n\r\nOn some farms on the Gareloch, in Dumbartonshire, about the year\r\n1830, the last handful of standing corn was called the Maiden. It\r\nwas divided in two, plaited, and then cut with the sickle by a girl,\r\nwho, it was thought, would be lucky and would soon be married. When\r\nit was cut the reapers gathered together and threw their sickles in\r\nthe air. The Maiden was dressed with ribbons and hung in the kitchen\r\nnear the roof, where it was kept for several years with the date\r\nattached. Sometimes five or six Maidens might be seen hanging at\r\nonce on hooks. The harvest-supper was called the Kirn. In other\r\nfarms on the Gareloch the last handful of corn was called the\r\nMaidenhead or the Head; it was neatly plaited, sometimes decked with\r\nribbons, and hung in the kitchen for a year, when the grain was\r\ngiven to the poultry.\r\n\r\nIn Aberdeenshire "the last sheaf cut, or \'Maiden,\' is carried home\r\nin merry procession by the harvesters. It is then presented to the\r\nmistress of the house, who dresses it up to be preserved till the\r\nfirst mare foals. The Maiden is then taken down and presented to the\r\nmare as its first food. The neglect of this would have untoward\r\neffects upon the foal, and disastrous consequences upon farm\r\noperations generally for the season." In the north-east of\r\nAberdeenshire the last sheaf is commonly called the _clyack_ sheaf.\r\nIt used to be cut by the youngest girl present and was dressed as a\r\nwoman. Being brought home in triumph, it was kept till Christmas\r\nmorning, and then given to a mare in foal, if there was one on the\r\nfarm, or, if there was not, to the oldest cow in calf. Elsewhere the\r\nsheaf was divided between all the cows and their calves or between\r\nall the horses and the cattle of the farm. In Fifeshire the last\r\nhandful of corn, known as the Maiden, is cut by a young girl and\r\nmade into the rude figure of a doll, tied with ribbons, by which it\r\nis hung on the wall of the farm-kitchen till the next spring. The\r\ncustom of cutting the Maiden at harvest was also observed in\r\nInverness-shire and Sutherlandshire.\r\n\r\nA somewhat maturer but still youthful age is assigned to the\r\ncorn-spirit by the appellations of Bride, Oats-bride, and\r\nWheat-bride, which in Germany are sometimes bestowed both on the\r\nlast sheaf and on the woman who binds it. At wheat-harvest near\r\nM\xfcglitz, in Moravia, a small portion of the wheat is left standing\r\nafter all the rest has been reaped. This remnant is then cut, amid\r\nthe rejoicing of the reapers, by a young girl who wears a wreath of\r\nwheaten ears on her head and goes by the name of the Wheat-bride. It\r\nis supposed that she will be a real bride that same year. Near\r\nRoslin and Stonehaven, in Scotland, the last handful of corn cut\r\n"got the name of \'the bride,\' and she was placed over the _bress_ or\r\nchimney-piece; she had a ribbon tied below her numerous _ears,_ and\r\nanother round her waist."\r\n\r\nSometimes the idea implied by the name of Bride is worked out more\r\nfully by representing the productive powers of vegetation as bride\r\nand bridegroom. Thus in the Vorharz an Oats-man and an Oats-woman,\r\nswathed in straw, dance at the harvest feast. In South Saxony an\r\nOats-bridegroom and an Oats-bride figure together at the harvest\r\ncelebration. The Oats-bridegroom is a man completely wrapt in\r\noats-straw; the Oats-bride is a man dressed in woman\'s clothes, but\r\nnot wrapt in straw. They are drawn in a waggon to the ale-house,\r\nwhere the dance takes place. At the beginning of the dance the\r\ndancers pluck the bunches of oats one by one from the\r\nOats-bridegroom, while he struggles to keep them, till at last he is\r\ncompletely stript of them and stands bare, exposed to the laughter\r\nand jests of the company. In Austrian Silesia the ceremony of "the\r\nWheat-bride" is celebrated by the young people at the end of the\r\nharvest. The woman who bound the last sheaf plays the part of the\r\nWheat-bride, wearing the harvest-crown of wheat ears and flowers on\r\nher head. Thus adorned, standing beside her Bridegroom in a waggon\r\nand attended by bridesmaids, she is drawn by a pair of oxen, in full\r\nimitation of a marriage procession, to the tavern, where the dancing\r\nis kept up till morning. Somewhat later in the season the wedding of\r\nthe Oats-bride is celebrated with the like rustic pomp. About\r\nNeisse, in Silesia, an Oats-king and an Oats-queen, dressed up\r\nquaintly as a bridal pair, are seated on a harrow and drawn by oxen\r\ninto the village.\r\n\r\nIn these last instances the corn-spirit is personified in double\r\nform as male and female. But sometimes the spirit appears in a\r\ndouble female form as both old and young, corresponding exactly to\r\nthe Greek Demeter and Persephone, if my interpretation of these\r\ngoddesses is right. We have seen that in Scotland, especially among\r\nthe Gaelic-speaking population, the last corn cut is sometimes\r\ncalled the Old Wife and sometimes the Maiden. Now there are parts of\r\nScotland in which both an Old Wife (_Cailleach_) and a Maiden are\r\ncut at harvest. The accounts of this custom are not quite clear and\r\nconsistent, but the general rule seems to be that, where both a\r\nMaiden and an Old Wife (_Cailleach_) are fashioned out of the reaped\r\ncorn at harvest, the Maiden is made out of the last stalks left\r\nstanding, and is kept by the farmer on whose land it was cut; while\r\nthe Old Wife is made out of other stalks, sometimes out of the first\r\nstalks cut, and is regularly passed on to a laggard farmer who\r\nhappens to be still reaping after his brisker neighbour has cut all\r\nhis corn. Thus while each farmer keeps his own Maiden, as the\r\nembodiment of the young and fruitful spirit of the corn, he passes\r\non the Old Wife as soon as he can to a neighbour, and so the old\r\nlady may make the round of all the farms in the district before she\r\nfinds a place in which to lay her venerable head. The farmer with\r\nwhom she finally takes up her abode is of course the one who has\r\nbeen the last of all the countryside to finish reaping his crops,\r\nand thus the distinction of entertaining her is rather an invidious\r\none. He is thought to be doomed to poverty or to be under the\r\nobligation of "providing for the dearth of the township" in the\r\nensuing season. Similarly we saw that in Pembrokeshire, where the\r\nlast corn cut is called, not the Maiden, but the Hag, she is passed\r\non hastily to a neighbour who is still at work in his fields and who\r\nreceives his aged visitor with anything but a transport of joy. If\r\nthe Old Wife represents the corn-spirit of the past year, as she\r\nprobably does wherever she is contrasted with and opposed to a\r\nMaiden, it is natural enough that her faded charms should have less\r\nattractions for the husbandman than the buxom form of her daughter,\r\nwho may be expected to become in her turn the mother of the golden\r\ngrain when the revolving year has brought round another autumn. The\r\nsame desire to get rid of the effete Mother of the Corn by palming\r\nher off on other people comes out clearly in some of the customs\r\nobserved at the close of threshing, particularly in the practice of\r\npassing on a hideous straw puppet to a neighbour farmer who is still\r\nthreshing his corn.\r\n\r\nThe harvest customs just described are strikingly analogous to the\r\nspring customs which we reviewed in an earlier part of this work.\r\n(1) As in the spring customs the tree-spirit is represented both by\r\na tree and by a person, so in the harvest customs the corn-spirit is\r\nrepresented both by the last sheaf and by the person who cuts or\r\nbinds or threshes it. The equivalence of the person to the sheaf is\r\nshown by giving him or her the same name as the sheaf; by wrapping\r\nhim or her in it; and by the rule observed in some places, that when\r\nthe sheaf is called the Mother, it must be made up into human shape\r\nby the oldest married woman, but that when it is called the Maiden,\r\nit must be cut by the youngest girl. Here the age of the personal\r\nrepresentative of the corn-spirit corresponds with that of the\r\nsupposed age of the corn-spirit, just as the human victims offered\r\nby the Mexicans to promote the growth of the maize varied with the\r\nage of the maize. For in the Mexican, as in the European, custom the\r\nhuman beings were probably representatives of the corn-spirit rather\r\nthan victims offered to it. (2) Again the same fertilising influence\r\nwhich the tree-spirit is supposed to exert over vegetation, cattle,\r\nand even women is ascribed to the corn-spirit. Thus, its supposed\r\ninfluence on vegetation is shown by the practice of taking some of\r\nthe grain of the last sheaf (in which the corn-spirit is regularly\r\nsupposed to be present), and scattering it among the young corn in\r\nspring or mixing it with the seed-corn. Its influence on animals is\r\nshown by giving the last sheaf to a mare in foal, to a cow in calf,\r\nand to horses at the first ploughing. Lastly, its influence on women\r\nis indicated by the custom of delivering the Mother-sheaf, made into\r\nthe likeness of a pregnant woman, to the farmer\'s wife; by the\r\nbelief that the woman who binds the last sheaf will have a child\r\nnext year; perhaps, too, by the idea that the person who gets it\r\nwill soon be married.\r\n\r\nPlainly, therefore, these spring and harvest customs are based on\r\nthe same ancient modes of thought, and form parts of the same\r\nprimitive heathendom, which was doubtless practised by our\r\nforefathers long before the dawn of history. Amongst the marks of a\r\nprimitive ritual we may note the following:\r\n\r\n1. No special class of persons is set apart for the performance of\r\nthe rites; in other words, there are no priests. The rites may be\r\nperformed by any one, as occasion demands.\r\n\r\n2. No special places are set apart for the performance of the rites;\r\nin other words, there are no temples. The rites may be performed\r\nanywhere, as occasion demands.\r\n\r\n3. Spirits, not gods, are recognised. (_a_) As distinguished from\r\ngods, spirits are restricted in their operations to definite\r\ndepartments of nature. Their names are general, not proper. Their\r\nattributes are generic, rather than individual; in other words,\r\nthere is an indefinite number of spirits of each class, and the\r\nindividuals of a class are all much alike; they have no definitely\r\nmarked individuality; no accepted traditions are current as to their\r\norigin, life, adventures, and character. (_b_) On the other hand\r\ngods, as distinguished from spirits, are not restricted to definite\r\ndepartments of nature. It is true that there is generally some one\r\ndepartment over which they preside as their special province; but\r\nthey are not rigorously confined to it; they can exert their power\r\nfor good or evil in many other spheres of nature and life. Again,\r\nthey bear individual or proper names, such as Demeter, Persephone,\r\nDionysus; and their individual characters and histories are fixed by\r\ncurrent myths and the representations of art.\r\n\r\n4. The rites are magical rather than propitiatory. In other words,\r\nthe desired objects are attained, not by propitiating the favour of\r\ndivine beings through sacrifice, prayer, and praise, but by\r\nceremonies which, as I have already explained, are believed to\r\ninfluence the course of nature directly through a physical sympathy\r\nor resemblance between the rite and the effect which it is the\r\nintention of the rite to produce.\r\n\r\nJudged by these tests, the spring and harvest customs of our\r\nEuropean peasantry deserve to rank as primitive. For no special\r\nclass of persons and no special places are set exclusively apart for\r\ntheir performance; they may be performed by any one, master or man,\r\nmistress or maid, boy or girl; they are practised, not in temples or\r\nchurches, but in the woods and meadows, beside brooks, in barns, on\r\nharvest fields and cottage floors. The supernatural beings whose\r\nexistence is taken for granted in them are spirits rather than\r\ndeities: their functions are limited to certain well-defined\r\ndepartments of nature: their names are general like the\r\nBarley-mother, the Old Woman, the Maiden, not proper names like\r\nDemeter, Persephone, Dionysus. Their generic attributes are known,\r\nbut their individual histories and characters are not the subject of\r\nmyths. For they exist in classes rather than as individuals, and the\r\nmembers of each class are indistinguishable. For example, every farm\r\nhas its Corn-mother, or its Old Woman, or its Maiden; but every\r\nCorn-mother is much like every other Corn-mother, and so with the\r\nOld Women and Maidens. Lastly, in these harvests, as in the spring\r\ncustoms, the ritual is magical rather than propitiatory. This is\r\nshown by throwing the Corn-mother into the river in order to secure\r\nrain and dew for the crops; by making the Old Woman heavy in order\r\nto get a heavy crop next year; by strewing grain from the last sheaf\r\namongst the young crops in spring; and by giving the last sheaf to\r\nthe cattle to make them thrive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVI. The Corn-Mother in Many Lands\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Corn-mother in America\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN peoples, ancient and modern, have not been singular in\r\npersonifying the corn as a mother goddess. The same simple idea has\r\nsuggested itself to other agricultural races in distant parts of the\r\nworld, and has been applied by them to other indigenous cereals than\r\nbarley and wheat. If Europe has its Wheat-mother and its\r\nBarley-mother, America has its Maize-mother and the East Indies\r\ntheir Rice-mother. These personifications I will now illustrate,\r\nbeginning with the American personification of the maize.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that among European peoples it is a common custom to\r\nkeep the plaited corn-stalks of the last sheaf, or the puppet which\r\nis formed out of them, in the farm-house from harvest to harvest.\r\nThe intention no doubt is, or rather originally was, by preserving\r\nthe representative of the corn-spirit to maintain the spirit itself\r\nin life and activity throughout the year, in order that the corn may\r\ngrow and the crops be good. This interpretation of the custom is at\r\nall events rendered highly probable by a similar custom observed by\r\nthe ancient Peruvians, and thus described by the old Spanish\r\nhistorian Acosta: "They take a certain portion of the most fruitful\r\nof the maize that grows in their farms, the which they put in a\r\ncertain granary which they do call _Pirua,_ with certain ceremonies,\r\nwatching three nights; they put this maize in the richest garments\r\nthey have, and being thus wrapped and dressed, they worship this\r\n_Pirua,_ and hold it in great veneration, saying it is the mother of\r\nthe maize of their inheritances, and that by this means the maize\r\naugments and is preserved. In this month [the sixth month, answering\r\nto May] they make a particular sacrifice, and the witches demand of\r\nthis _Pirua_ if it hath strength sufficient to continue until the\r\nnext year; and if it answers no, then they carry this maize to the\r\nfarm to burn, whence they brought it, according to every man\'s\r\npower; then they make another _Pirua,_ with the same ceremonies,\r\nsaying that they renew it, to the end the seed of maize may not\r\nperish, and if it answers that it hath force sufficient to last\r\nlonger, they leave it until the next year. This foolish vanity\r\ncontinueth to this day, and it is very common amongst the Indians to\r\nhave these _Piruas._"\r\n\r\nIn this description of the custom there seems to be some error.\r\nProbably it was the dressed-up bunch of maize, not the granary\r\n(_Pirua_), which was worshipped by the Peruvians and regarded as the\r\nMother of the Maize. This is confirmed by what we know of the\r\nPeruvian custom from another source. The Peruvians, we are told,\r\nbelieved all useful plants to be animated by a divine being who\r\ncauses their growth. According to the particular plant, these divine\r\nbeings were called the Maize-mother (_Zara-mama_), the Quinoa-mother\r\n(_Quinoa-mama_), the Coca-mother (_Coca-mama_), and the\r\nPotato-mother (_Axo-mama_). Figures of these divine mothers were\r\nmade respectively of ears of maize and leaves of the quinoa and coca\r\nplants; they were dressed in women\'s clothes and worshipped. Thus\r\nthe Maize-mother was represented by a puppet made of stalks of maize\r\ndressed in full female attire; and the Indians believed that "as\r\nmother, it had the power of producing and giving birth to much\r\nmaize." Probably, therefore, Acosta misunderstood his informant, and\r\nthe Mother of the Maize which he describes was not the granary\r\n(_Pirua_), but the bunch of maize dressed in rich vestments. The\r\nPeruvian Mother of the Maize, like the harvest-Maiden at\r\nBalquhidder, was kept for a year in order that by her means the corn\r\nmight grow and multiply. But lest her strength might not suffice to\r\nlast till the next harvest, she was asked in the course of the year\r\nhow she felt, and if she answered that she felt weak, she was burned\r\nand a fresh Mother of the Maize made, "to the end the seed of maize\r\nmay not perish." Here, it may be observed, we have a strong\r\nconfirmation of the explanation already given of the custom of\r\nkilling the god, both periodically and occasionally. The Mother of\r\nthe maize was allowed, as a rule, to live through a year, that being\r\nthe period during which her strength might reasonably be supposed to\r\nlast unimpaired; but on any symptom of her strength failing she was\r\nput to death, and a fresh and vigorous Mother of the Maize took her\r\nplace, lest the maize which depended on her for its existence should\r\nlanguish and decay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Rice-mother in the East Indies\r\n\r\nIF THE READER still feels any doubts as to the meaning of the\r\nharvest customs which have been practised within living memory by\r\nEuropean peasants, these doubts may perhaps be dispelled by\r\ncomparing the customs observed at the rice-harvest by the Malays and\r\nDyaks of the East Indies. For these Eastern peoples have not, like\r\nour peasantry, advanced beyond the intellectual stage at which the\r\ncustoms originated; their theory and their practice are still in\r\nunison; for them the quaint rites which in Europe have long dwindled\r\ninto mere fossils, the pastime of clowns and the puzzle of the\r\nlearned, are still living realities of which they can render an\r\nintelligible and truthful account. Hence a study of their beliefs\r\nand usages concerning the rice may throw some light on the true\r\nmeaning of the ritual of the corn in ancient Greece and modern\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nNow the whole of the ritual which the Malays and Dyaks observe in\r\nconnexion with the rice is founded on the simple conception of the\r\nrice as animated by a soul like that which these people attribute to\r\nmankind. They explain the phenomena of reproduction, growth, decay,\r\nand death in the rice on the same principles on which they explain\r\nthe corresponding phenomena in human beings. They imagine that in\r\nthe fibres of the plant, as in the body of a man, there is a certain\r\nvital element, which is so far independent of the plant that it may\r\nfor a time be completely separated from it without fatal effects,\r\nthough if its absence be prolonged beyond certain limits the plant\r\nwill wither and die. This vital yet separable element is what, for\r\nthe want of a better word, we must call the soul of a plant, just as\r\na similar vital and separable element is commonly supposed to\r\nconstitute the soul of man; and on this theory or myth of the\r\nplant-soul is built the whole worship of the cereals, just as on the\r\ntheory or myth of the human soul is built the whole worship of the\r\ndead,--a towering superstructure reared on a slender and precarious\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nBelieving the rice to be animated by a soul like that of a man, the\r\nIndonesians naturally treat it with the deference and the\r\nconsideration which they show to their fellows. Thus they behave\r\ntowards the rice in bloom as they behave towards a pregnant woman;\r\nthey abstain from firing guns or making loud noises in the field,\r\nlest they should so frighten the soul of the rice that it would\r\nmiscarry and bear no grain; and for the same reason they will not\r\ntalk of corpses or demons in the rice-fields. Moreover, they feed\r\nthe blooming rice with foods of various kinds which are believed to\r\nbe wholesome for women with child; but when the rice-ears are just\r\nbeginning to form, they are looked upon as infants, and women go\r\nthrough the fields feeding them with rice-pap as if they were human\r\nbabes. In such natural and obvious comparisons of the breeding plant\r\nto a breeding woman, and of the young grain to a young child, is to\r\nbe sought the origin of the kindred Greek conception of the\r\nCorn-mother and the Corn-daughter, Demeter and Persephone. But if\r\nthe timorous feminine soul of the rice can be frightened into a\r\nmiscarriage even by loud noises, it is easy to imagine what her\r\nfeelings must be at harvest, when people are under the sad necessity\r\nof cutting down the rice with the knife. At so critical a season\r\nevery precaution must be used to render the necessary surgical\r\noperation of reaping as inconspicuous and as painless as possible.\r\nFor that reason the reaping of the seed-rice is done with knives of\r\na peculiar pattern, such that the blades are hidden in the reapers\'\r\nhands and do not frighten the rice-spirit till the very last moment,\r\nwhen her head is swept off almost before she is aware; and from a\r\nlike delicate motive the reapers at work in the fields employ a\r\nspecial form of speech, which the rice-spirit cannot be expected to\r\nunderstand, so that she has no warning or inkling of what is going\r\nforward till the heads of rice are safely deposited in the basket.\r\n\r\nAmong the Indonesian peoples who thus personify the rice we may take\r\nthe Kayans or Bahaus of Central Borneo as typical. In order to\r\nsecure and detain the volatile soul of the rice the Kayans resort to\r\na number of devices. Among the instruments employed for this purpose\r\nare a miniature ladder, a spatula, and a basket containing hooks,\r\nthorns, and cords. With the spatula the priestess strokes the soul\r\nof the rice down the little ladder into the basket, where it is\r\nnaturally held fast by the hooks, the thorn, and the cord; and\r\nhaving thus captured and imprisoned the soul she conveys it into the\r\nrice-granary. Sometimes a bamboo box and a net are used for the same\r\npurpose. And in order to ensure a good harvest for the following\r\nyear it is necessary not only to detain the soul of all the grains\r\nof rice which are safely stored in the granary, but also to attract\r\nand recover the soul of all the rice that has been lost through\r\nfalling to the earth or being eaten by deer, apes, and pigs. For\r\nthis purpose instruments of various sorts have been invented by the\r\npriests. One, for example, is a bamboo vessel provided with four\r\nhooks made from the wood of a fruit-tree, by means of which the\r\nabsent rice-soul may be hooked and drawn back into the vessel, which\r\nis then hung up in the house. Sometimes two hands carved out of the\r\nwood of a fruit-tree are used for the same purpose. And every time\r\nthat a Kayan housewife fetches rice from the granary for the use of\r\nher household, she must propitiate the souls of the rice in the\r\ngranary, lest they should be angry at being robbed of their\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nThe same need of securing the soul of the rice, if the crop is to\r\nthrive, is keenly felt by the Karens of Burma. When a rice-field\r\ndoes not flourish, they suppose that the soul (_kelah_) of the rice\r\nis in some way detained from the rice. If the soul cannot be called\r\nback, the crop will fail. The following formula is used in recalling\r\nthe _kelah_ (soul) of the rice: "O come, rice-_kelah,_ come! Come to\r\nthe field. Come to the rice. With seed of each gender, come. Come\r\nfrom the river Kho, come from the river Kaw; from the place where\r\nthey meet, come. Come from the West, come from the East. From the\r\nthroat of the bird, from the maw of the ape, from the throat of the\r\nelephant. Come from the sources of rivers and their mouths. Come\r\nfrom the country of the Shan and Burman. From the distant kingdoms\r\ncome. From all granaries come. O rice-_kelah,_ come to the rice."\r\n\r\nThe Corn-mother of our European peasants has her match in the\r\nRice-mother of the Minangkabauers of Sumatra. The Minangkabauers\r\ndefinitely attribute a soul to rice, and will sometimes assert that\r\nrice pounded in the usual way tastes better than rice ground in a\r\nmill, because in the mill the body of the rice was so bruised and\r\nbattered that the soul has fled from it. Like the Javanese they\r\nthink that the rice is under the special guardianship of a female\r\nspirit called Saning Sari, who is conceived as so closely knit up\r\nwith the plant that the rice often goes by her name, as with the\r\nRomans the corn might be called Ceres. In particular Saning Sari is\r\nrepresented by certain stalks or grains called _indoea padi,_ that\r\nis, literally, "Mother of Rice," a name that is often given to the\r\nguardian spirit herself. This so-called Mother of Rice is the\r\noccasion of a number of ceremonies observed at the planting and\r\nharvesting of the rice as well as during its preservation in the\r\nbarn. When the seed of the rice is about to be sown in the nursery\r\nor bedding-out ground, where under the wet system of cultivation it\r\nis regularly allowed to sprout before being transplanted to the\r\nfields, the best grains are picked out to form the Rice-mother.\r\nThese are then sown in the middle of the bed, and the common seed is\r\nplanted round about them. The state of the Rice-mother is supposed\r\nto exert the greatest influence on the growth of the rice; if she\r\ndroops or pines away, the harvest will be bad in consequence. The\r\nwoman who sows the Rice-mother in the nursery lets her hair hang\r\nloose and afterwards bathes, as a means of ensuring an abundant\r\nharvest. When the time comes to transplant the rice from the nursery\r\nto the field, the Rice-mother receives a special place either in the\r\nmiddle or in a corner of the field, and a prayer or charm is uttered\r\nas follows: "Saning Sari, may a measure of rice come from a stalk of\r\nrice and a basketful from a root; may you be frightened neither by\r\nlightning nor by passers-by! Sunshine make you glad; with the storm\r\nmay you be at peace; and may rain serve to wash your face!" While\r\nthe rice is growing, the particular plant which was thus treated as\r\nthe Rice-mother is lost sight of; but before harvest another\r\nRice-mother is found. When the crop is ripe for cutting, the oldest\r\nwoman of the family or a sorcerer goes out to look for her. The\r\nfirst stalks seen to bend under a passing breeze are the\r\nRice-mother, and they are tied together but not cut until the\r\nfirst-fruits of the field have been carried home to serve as a\r\nfestal meal for the family and their friends, nay even for the\r\ndomestic animals; since it is Saning Sari\'s pleasure that the beasts\r\nalso should partake of her good gifts. After the meal has been\r\neaten, the Rice-mother is fetched home by persons in gay attire, who\r\ncarry her very carefully under an umbrella in a neatly worked bag to\r\nthe barn, where a place in the middle is assigned to her. Every one\r\nbelieves that she takes care of the rice in the barn and even\r\nmultiplies it not uncommonly.\r\n\r\nWhen the Tomori of Central Celebes are about to plant the rice, they\r\nbury in the field some betel as an offering to the spirits who cause\r\nthe rice to grow. The rice that is planted round this spot is the\r\nlast to be reaped at harvest. At the commencement of the reaping the\r\nstalks of this patch of rice are tied together into a sheaf, which\r\nis called "the Mother of the Rice" (_ineno pae_), and offerings in\r\nthe shape of rice, fowl\'s liver, eggs, and other things are laid\r\ndown before it. When all the rest of the rice in the field has been\r\nreaped, "the Mother of the Rice" is cut down and carried with due\r\nhonour to the rice-barn, where it is laid on the floor, and all the\r\nother sheaves are piled upon it. The Tomori, we are told, regard the\r\nMother of the Rice as a special offering made to the rice-spirit\r\nOmonga, who dwells in the moon. If that spirit is not treated with\r\nproper respect, for example if the people who fetch rice from the\r\nbarn are not decently clad, he is angry and punishes the offenders\r\nby eating up twice as much rice in the barn as they have taken out\r\nof it; some people have heard him smacking his lips in the barn, as\r\nhe devoured the rice. On the other hand the Toradjas of Central\r\nCelebes, who also practice the custom of the Rice-mother at harvest,\r\nregard her as the actual mother of the whole harvest, and therefore\r\nkeep her carefully, lest in her absence the garnered store of rice\r\nshould all melt away and disappear.\r\n\r\nAgain, just as in Scotland the old and the young spirit of the corn\r\nare represented as an Old Wife (_Cailleach_) and a Maiden\r\nrespectively, so in the Malay Peninsula we find both the Rice-mother\r\nand her child represented by different sheaves or bundles of ears on\r\nthe harvest-field. The ceremony of cutting and bringing home the\r\nSoul of the Rice was witnessed by Mr. W. W. Skeat at Chodoi in\r\nSelangor on the twenty-eighth of January 1897. The particular bunch\r\nor sheaf which was to serve as the Mother of the Rice-soul had\r\npreviously been sought and identified by means of the markings or\r\nshape of the ears. From this sheaf an aged sorceress, with much\r\nsolemnity, cut a little bundle of seven ears, anointed them with\r\noil, tied them round with parti-coloured thread, fumigated them with\r\nincense, and having wrapt them in a white cloth deposited them in a\r\nlittle oval-shaped basket. These seven ears were the infant Soul of\r\nthe Rice and the little basket was its cradle. It was carried home\r\nto the farmer\'s house by another woman, who held up an umbrella to\r\nscreen the tender infant from the hot rays of the sun. Arrived at\r\nthe house the Rice-child was welcomed by the women of the family,\r\nand laid, cradle and all, on a new sleepingmat with pillows at the\r\nhead. After that the farmer\'s wife was instructed to observe certain\r\nrules of taboo for three days, the rules being in many respects\r\nidentical with those which have to be observed for three days after\r\nthe birth of a real child. Something of the same tender care which\r\nis thus bestowed on the newly-born Rice-child is naturally extended\r\nalso to its parent, the sheaf from whose body it was taken. This\r\nsheaf, which remains standing in the field after the Rice-soul has\r\nbeen carried home and put to bed, is treated as a newly-made mother;\r\nthat is to say, young shoots of trees are pounded together and\r\nscattered broadcast every evening for three successive days, and\r\nwhen the three days are up you take the pulp of a coco-nut and what\r\nare called "goat-flowers," mix them up, eat them with a little\r\nsugar, and spit some of the mixture out among the rice. So after a\r\nreal birth the young shoots of the jack-fruit, the rose-apple,\r\ncertain kinds of banana, and the thin pulp of young coco-nuts are\r\nmixed with dried fish, salt, acid, prawn-condiment, and the like\r\ndainties to form a sort of salad, which is administered to mother\r\nand child for three successive days. The last sheaf is reaped by the\r\nfarmer\'s wife, who carries it back to the house, where it is\r\nthreshed and mixed with the Rice-soul. The farmer then takes the\r\nRice-soul and its basket and deposits it, together with the product\r\nof the last sheaf, in the big circular rice-bin used by the Malays.\r\nSome grains from the Rice-soul are mixed with the seed which is to\r\nbe sown in the following year. In this Rice-mother and Rice-child of\r\nthe Malay Peninsula we may see the counterpart and in a sense the\r\nprototype of the Demeter and Persephone of ancient Greece.\r\n\r\nOnce more, the European custom of representing the corn-spirit in\r\nthe double form of bride and bridegroom has its parallel in a\r\nceremony observed at the rice-harvest in Java. Before the reapers\r\nbegin to cut the rice, the priest or sorcerer picks out a number of\r\nears of rice, which are tied together, smeared with ointment, and\r\nadorned with flowers. Thus decked out, the ears are called the\r\n_padi-peengant\xe8n,_ that is, the Rice-bride and the Rice-bridegroom;\r\ntheir wedding feast is celebrated, and the cutting of the rice\r\nbegins immediately afterwards. Later on, when the rice is being got\r\nin, a bridal chamber is partitioned off in the barn, and furnished\r\nwith a new mat, a lamp, and all kinds of toilet articles. Sheaves of\r\nrice, to represent the wedding guests, are placed beside the\r\nRice-bride and the Rice-bridegroom. Not till this has been done may\r\nthe whole harvest be housed in the barn. And for the first forty\r\ndays after the rice has been housed, no one may enter the barn, for\r\nfear of disturbing the newly-wedded pair.\r\n\r\nIn the islands of Bali and Lombok, when the time of harvest has\r\ncome, the owner of the field himself makes a beginning by cutting\r\n"the principal rice" with his own hands and binding it into two\r\nsheaves, each composed of one hundred and eight stalks with their\r\nleaves attached to them. One of the sheaves represents a man and the\r\nother a woman, and they are called "husband and wife." The male\r\nsheaf is wound about with thread so that none of the leaves are\r\nvisible, whereas the female sheaf has its leaves bent over and tied\r\nso as to resemble the roll of a woman\'s hair. Sometimes, for further\r\ndistinction, a necklace of rice-straw is tied round the female\r\nsheaf. When the rice is brought home from the field, the two sheaves\r\nrepresenting the husband and wife are carried by a woman on her\r\nhead, and are the last of all to be deposited in the barn. There\r\nthey are laid to rest on a small erection or on a cushion of\r\nrice-straw. The whole arrangement, we are informed, has for its\r\nobject to induce the rice to increase and multiply in the granary,\r\nso that the owner may get more out of it than he put in. Hence when\r\nthe people of Bali bring the two sheaves, the husband and wife, into\r\nthe barn, they say, "Increase ye and multiply without ceasing." When\r\nall the rice in the barn has been used up, the two sheaves\r\nrepresenting the husband and wife remain in the empty building till\r\nthey have gradually disappeared or been devoured by mice. The pinch\r\nof hunger sometimes drives individuals to eat up the rice of these\r\ntwo sheaves, but the wretches who do so are viewed with disgust by\r\ntheir fellows and branded as pigs and dogs. Nobody would ever sell\r\nthese holy sheaves with the rest of their profane brethren.\r\n\r\nThe same notion of the propagation of the rice by a male and female\r\npower finds expression amongst the Szis of Upper Burma. When the\r\npaddy, that is, the rice with the husks still on it, has been dried\r\nand piled in a heap for threshing, all the friends of the household\r\nare invited to the threshing-floor, and food and drink are brought\r\nout. The heap of paddy is divided and one half spread out for\r\nthreshing, while the other half is left piled up. On the pile food\r\nand spirits are set, and one of the elders, addressing "the father\r\nand mother of the paddy-plant," prays for plenteous harvests in\r\nfuture, and begs that the seed may bear many fold. Then the whole\r\nparty eat, drink, and make merry. This ceremony at the\r\nthreshing-floor is the only occasion when these people invoke "the\r\nfather and mother of the paddy."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The Spirit of the Corn embodied in Human Beings\r\n\r\nTHUS the theory which recognises in the European Corn-mother,\r\nCorn-maiden, and so forth, the embodiment in vegetable form of the\r\nanimating spirit of the crops is amply confirmed by the evidence of\r\npeoples in other parts of the world, who, because they have lagged\r\nbehind the European races in mental development, retain for that\r\nvery reason a keener sense of the original motives for observing\r\nthose rustic rites which among ourselves have sunk to the level of\r\nmeaningless survivals. The reader may, however, remember that\r\naccording to Mannhardt, whose theory I am expounding, the spirit of\r\nthe corn manifests itself not merely in vegetable but also in human\r\nform; the person who cuts the last sheaf or gives the last stroke at\r\nthreshing passes for a temporary embodiment of the corn-spirit, just\r\nas much as the bunch of corn which he reaps or threshes. Now in the\r\nparallels which have been hitherto adduced from the customs of\r\npeoples outside Europe the spirit of the crops appears only in\r\nvegetable form. It remains, therefore, to prove that other races\r\nbesides our European peasantry have conceived the spirit of the\r\ncrops as incorporate in or represented by living men and women. Such\r\na proof, I may remind the reader, is germane to the theme of this\r\nbook; for the more instances we discover of human beings\r\nrepresenting in themselves the life or animating spirit of plants,\r\nthe less difficulty will be felt at classing amongst them the King\r\nof the Wood at Nemi.\r\n\r\nThe Mandans and Minnitarees of North America used to hold a festival\r\nin spring which they called the corn-medicine festival of the women.\r\nThey thought that a certain Old Woman who Never Dies made the crops\r\nto grow, and that, living somewhere in the south, she sent the\r\nmigratory waterfowl in spring as her tokens and representatives.\r\nEach sort of bird represented a special kind of crop cultivated by\r\nthe Indians: the wild goose stood for the maize, the wild swan for\r\nthe gourds, and the wild duck for the beans. So when the feathered\r\nmessengers of the Old Woman began to arrive in spring the Indians\r\ncelebrated the corn-medicine festival of the women. Scaffolds were\r\nset up, on which the people hung dried meat and other things by way\r\nof offerings to the Old Woman; and on a certain day the old women of\r\nthe tribe, as representatives of the Old Woman who Never Dies,\r\nassembled at the scaffolds each bearing in her hand an ear of maize\r\nfastened to a stick. They first planted these sticks in the ground,\r\nthen danced round the scaffolds, and finally took up the sticks\r\nagain in their arms. Meanwhile old men beat drums and shook rattles\r\nas a musical accompaniment to the performance of the old women.\r\nFurther, young women came and put dried flesh into the mouths of the\r\nold women, for which they received in return a grain of the\r\nconsecrated maize to eat. Three or four grains of the holy corn were\r\nalso placed in the dishes of the young women, to be afterwards\r\ncarefully mixed with the seed-corn, which they were supposed to\r\nfertilise. The dried flesh hung on the scaffold belonged to the old\r\nwomen, because they represented the Old Woman who Never Dies. A\r\nsimilar corn-medicine festival was held in autumn for the purpose of\r\nattracting the herds of buffaloes and securing a supply of meat. At\r\nthat time every woman carried in her arms an uprooted plant of\r\nmaize. They gave the name of the Old Woman who Never Dies both to\r\nthe maize and to those birds which they regarded as symbols of the\r\nfruits of the earth, and they prayed to them in autumn saying,\r\n"Mother, have pity on us! send us not the bitter cold too soon, lest\r\nwe have not meat enough! let not all the game depart, that we may\r\nhave something for the winter!" In autumn, when the birds were\r\nflying south, the Indians thought that they were going home to the\r\nOld Woman and taking to her the offerings that had been hung up on\r\nthe scaffolds, especially the dried meat, which she ate. Here then\r\nwe have the spirit or divinity of the corn conceived as an Old Woman\r\nand represented in bodily form by old women, who in their capacity\r\nof representatives receive some at least of the offerings which are\r\nintended for her.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of India the harvest-goddess Gauri is represented at\r\nonce by an unmarried girl and by a bundle of wild balsam plants,\r\nwhich is made up into the figure of a woman and dressed as such with\r\nmask, garments, and ornaments. Both the human and the vegetable\r\nrepresentative of the goddess are worshipped, and the intention of\r\nthe whole ceremony appears to be to ensure a good crop of rice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The Double Personification of the Corn as Mother and Daughter\r\n\r\nCOMPARED with the Corn-mother of Germany and the Harvest-maiden of\r\nScotland, the Demeter and Persephone of Greece are late products of\r\nreligious growth. Yet as members of the Aryan family the Greeks must\r\nat one time or another have observed harvest customs like those\r\nwhich are still practised by Celts, Teutons, and Slavs, and which,\r\nfar beyond the limits of the Aryan world, have been practised by the\r\nIndians of Peru and many peoples of the East Indies--a sufficient\r\nproof that the ideas on which these customs rest are not confined to\r\nany one race, but naturally suggest themselves to all untutored\r\npeoples engaged in agriculture. It is probable, therefore, that\r\nDemeter and Persephone, those stately and beautiful figures of Greek\r\nmythology, grew out of the same simple beliefs and practices which\r\nstill prevail among our modern peasantry, and that they were\r\nrepresented by rude dolls made out of the yellow sheaves on many a\r\nharvest-field long before their breathing images were wrought in\r\nbronze and marble by the master hands of Phidias and Praxiteles. A\r\nreminiscence of that olden time--a scent, so to say, of the\r\nharvest-field--lingered to the last in the title of the Maiden\r\n(_Kore_) by which Persephone was commonly known. Thus if the\r\nprototype of Demeter is the Corn-mother of Germany, the prototype of\r\nPersephone is the Harvest-maiden which, autumn after autumn, is\r\nstill made from the last sheaf on the Braes of Balquhidder. Indeed,\r\nif we knew more about the peasant-farmers of ancient Greece, we\r\nshould probably find that even in classical times they continued\r\nannually to fashion their Corn-mothers (Demeters) and Maidens\r\n(Persephones) out of the ripe corn on the harvest-fields. But\r\nunfortunately the Demeter and Persephone whom we know were the\r\ndenizens of towns, the majestic inhabitants of lordly temples; it\r\nwas for such divinities alone that the refined writers of antiquity\r\nhad eyes; the uncouth rites performed by rustics amongst the corn\r\nwere beneath their notice. Even if they noticed them, they probably\r\nnever dreamed of any connexion between the puppet of corn-stalks on\r\nthe sunny stubble-field and the marble divinity in the shady\r\ncoolness of the temple. Still the writings even of these town-bred\r\nand cultured persons afford us an occasional glimpse of a Demeter as\r\nrude as the rudest that a remote German village can show. Thus the\r\nstory that Iasion begat a child Plutus ( "wealth," "abundance") by\r\nDemeter on a thrice-ploughed field, may be compared with the West\r\nPrussian custom of the mock birth of a child on the harvest-field.\r\nIn this Prussian custom the pretended mother represents the\r\nCorn-mother (Zytniamatka_); the pretended child represents the\r\nCorn-baby, and the whole ceremony is a charm to ensure a crop next\r\nyear. The custom and the legend alike point to an older practice of\r\nperforming, among the sprouting crops in spring or the stubble in\r\nautumn, one of those real or mimic acts of procreation by which, as\r\nwe have seen, primitive man often seeks to infuse his own vigorous\r\nlife into the languid or decaying energies of nature. Another\r\nglimpse of the savage under the civilised Demeter will be afforded\r\nfarther on, when we come to deal with another aspect of those\r\nagricultural divinities.\r\n\r\nThe reader may have observed that in modern folk-customs the\r\ncorn-spirit is generally represented either by a Corn-mother (Old\r\nWoman, etc.) or by a Maiden (Harvest-child, etc.), not both by a\r\nCorn-mother and by a Maiden. Why then did the Greeks represent the\r\ncorn both as a mother and a daughter?\r\n\r\nIn the Breton custom the mother-sheaf--a large figure made out of\r\nthe last sheaf with a small corn-doll inside of it--clearly\r\nrepresents both the Corn-mother and the Corn-daughter, the latter\r\nstill unborn. Again, in the Prussian custom just referred to, the\r\nwoman who plays the part of Corn-mother represents the ripe grain;\r\nthe child appears to represent next year\'s corn, which may be\r\nregarded, naturally enough, as the child of this year\'s corn, since\r\nit is from the seed of this year\'s harvest that next year\'s crop\r\nwill spring. Further, we have seen that among the Malays of the\r\nPeninsula and sometimes among the Highlanders of Scotland the spirit\r\nof the grain is represented in double female form, both as old and\r\nyoung, by means of ears taken alike from the ripe crop: in Scotland\r\nthe old spirit of the corn appears as the Carline or _Cailleach,_\r\nthe young spirit as the Maiden; while among the Malays of the\r\nPeninsula the two spirits of the rice are definitely related to each\r\nother as mother and child. Judged by these analogies Demeter would\r\nbe the ripe crop of this year; Persephone would be the seed-corn\r\ntaken from it and sown in autumn, to reappear in spring. The descent\r\nof Persephone into the lower world would thus be a mythical\r\nexpression for the sowing of the seed; her reappearance in spring\r\nwould signify the sprouting of the young corn. In this way the\r\nPersephone of one year becomes the Demeter of the next, and this may\r\nvery well have been the original form of the myth. But when with the\r\nadvance of religious thought the corn came to be personified no\r\nlonger as a being that went through the whole cycle of birth,\r\ngrowth, reproduction, and death within a year, but as an immortal\r\ngoddess, consistency required that one of the two personifications,\r\nthe mother or the daughter, should be sacrificed. However, the\r\ndouble conception of the corn as mother and daughter may have been\r\ntoo old and too deeply rooted in the popular mind to be eradicated\r\nby logic, and so room had to be found in the reformed myth both for\r\nmother and daughter. This was done by assigning to Persephone the\r\ncharacter of the corn sown in autumn and sprouting in spring, while\r\nDemeter was left to play the somewhat vague part of the heavy mother\r\nof the corn, who laments its annual disappearance underground, and\r\nrejoices over its reappearance in spring. Thus instead of a regular\r\nsuccession of divine beings, each living a year and then giving\r\nbirth to her successor, the reformed myth exhibits the conception of\r\ntwo divine and immortal beings, one of whom annually disappears into\r\nand reappears from the ground, while the other has little to do but\r\nto weep and rejoice at the appropriate seasons.\r\n\r\nThis theory of the double personification of the corn in Greek myth\r\nassumes that both personifications (Demeter and Persephone) are\r\noriginal. But if we suppose that the Greek myth started with a\r\nsingle personification, the aftergrowth of a second personification\r\nmay perhaps be explained as follows. On looking over the harvest\r\ncustoms which have been passed under review, it may be noticed that\r\nthey involve two distinct conceptions of the corn-spirit. For\r\nwhereas in some of the customs the corn-spirit is treated as\r\nimmanent in the corn, in others it is regarded as external to it.\r\nThus when a particular sheaf is called by the name of the\r\ncorn-spirit, and is dressed in clothes and handled with reverence,\r\nthe spirit is clearly regarded as immanent in the corn. But when the\r\nspirit is said to make the crops grow by passing through them, or to\r\nblight the grain of those against whom she has a grudge, she is\r\napparently conceived as distinct from, though exercising power over,\r\nthe corn. Conceived in the latter mode the corn-spirit is in a fair\r\nway to become a deity of the corn, if she has not become so already.\r\nOf these two conceptions, that of the cornspirit as immanent in the\r\ncorn is doubtless the older, since the view of nature as animated by\r\nindwelling spirits appears to have generally preceded the view of it\r\nas controlled by external deities; to put it shortly, animism\r\nprecedes deism. In the harvest customs of our European peasantry the\r\ncorn-spirit seems to be conceived now as immanent in the corn and\r\nnow as external to it. In Greek mythology, on the other hand,\r\nDemeter is viewed rather as the deity of the corn than as the spirit\r\nimmanent in it. The process of thought which leads to the change\r\nfrom the one mode of conception to the other is anthropomorphism, or\r\nthe gradual investment of the immanent spirits with more and more of\r\nthe attributes of humanity. As men emerge from savagery the tendency\r\nto humanise their divinities gains strength; and the more human\r\nthese become the wider is the breach which severs them from the\r\nnatural objects of which they were at first merely the animating\r\nspirits or souls. But in the progress upwards from savagery men of\r\nthe same generation do not march abreast; and though the new\r\nanthropomorphic gods may satisfy the religious wants of the more\r\ndeveloped intelligences, the backward members of the community will\r\ncling by preference to the old animistic notions. Now when the\r\nspirit of any natural object such as the corn has been invested with\r\nhuman qualities, detached from the object, and converted into a\r\ndeity controlling it, the object itself is, by the withdrawal of its\r\nspirit, left inanimate; it becomes, so to say, a spiritual vacuum.\r\nBut the popular fancy, intolerant of such a vacuum, in other words,\r\nunable to conceive anything as inanimate, immediately creates a\r\nfresh mythical being, with which it peoples the vacant object. Thus\r\nthe same natural object comes to be represented in mythology by two\r\ndistinct beings: first by the old spirit now separated from it and\r\nraised to the rank of a deity; second, by the new spirit, freshly\r\ncreated by the popular fancy to supply the place vacated by the old\r\nspirit on its elevation to a higher sphere. In such cases the\r\nproblem for mythology is, having got two distinct personifications\r\nof the same object, what to do with them? How are their relations to\r\neach other to be adjusted, and room found for both in the\r\nmythological system? When the old spirit or new deity is conceived\r\nas creating or producing the object in question, the problem is\r\neasily solved. Since the object is believed to be produced by the\r\nold spirit, and animated by the new one, the latter, as the soul of\r\nthe object, must also owe its existence to the former; thus the old\r\nspirit will stand to the new one as producer to produced, that is,\r\nin mythology, as parent to child, and if both spirits are conceived\r\nas female, their relation will be that of mother and daughter. In\r\nthis way, starting from a single personification of the corn as\r\nfemale, mythic fancy might in time reach a double personification of\r\nit as mother and daughter. It would be very rash to affirm that this\r\nwas the way in which the myth of Demeter and Persephone actually\r\ntook shape; but it seems a legitimate conjecture that the\r\nreduplication of deities, of which Demeter and Persephone furnish an\r\nexample, may sometimes have arisen in the way indicated. For\r\nexample, among the pairs of deities dealt with in a former part of\r\nthis work, it has been shown that there are grounds for regarding\r\nboth Isis and her companion god Osiris as personifications of the\r\ncorn. On the hypothesis just suggested, Isis would be the old\r\ncorn-spirit, and Osiris would be the newer one, whose relationship\r\nto the old spirit was variously explained as that of brother,\r\nhusband, and son; for of course mythology would always be free to\r\naccount for the coexistence of the two divinities in more ways than\r\none. It must not, however, be forgotten that this proposed\r\nexplanation of such pairs of deities as Demeter and Persephone or\r\nIsis and Osiris is purely conjectural, and is only given for what it\r\nis worth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII. Lityerses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Songs of the Corn Reapers\r\n\r\nIN THE PRECEDING pages an attempt has been made to show that in the\r\nCorn-mother and Harvest-maiden of Northern Europe we have the\r\nprototypes of Demeter and Persephone. But an essential feature is\r\nstill wanting to complete the resemblance. A leading incident in the\r\nGreek myth is the death and resurrection of Persephone; it is this\r\nincident which, coupled with the nature of the goddess as a deity of\r\nvegetation, links the myth with the cults of Adonis, Attis, Osiris,\r\nand Dionysus; and it is in virtue of this incident that the myth\r\nfinds a place in our discussion of the Dying God. It remains,\r\ntherefore, to see whether the conception of the annual death and\r\nresurrection of a god, which figures so prominently in these great\r\nGreek and Oriental worships, has not also its origin or its analogy\r\nin the rustic rites observed by reapers and vine-dressers amongst\r\nthe corn-shocks and the vines.\r\n\r\nOur general ignorance of the popular superstitions and customs of\r\nthe ancients has already been confessed. But the obscurity which\r\nthus hangs over the first beginnings of ancient religion is\r\nfortunately dissipated to some extent in the present case. The\r\nworships of Osiris, Adonis, and Attis had their respective seats, as\r\nwe have seen, in Egypt, Syria, and Phrygia; and in each of these\r\ncountries certain harvest and vintage customs are known to have been\r\nobserved, the resemblance of which to each other and to the national\r\nrites struck the ancients themselves, and, compared with the harvest\r\ncustoms of modern peasants and barbarians, seems to throw some light\r\non the origin of the rites in question.\r\n\r\nIt has been already mentioned, on the authority of Diodorus, that in\r\nancient Egypt the reapers were wont to lament over the first sheaf\r\ncut, invoking Isis as the goddess to whom they owed the discovery of\r\ncorn. To the plaintive song or cry sung or uttered by Egyptian\r\nreapers the Greeks gave the name of Maneros, and explained the name\r\nby a story that Maneros, the only son of the first Egyptian king,\r\ninvented agriculture, and, dying an untimely death, was thus\r\nlamented by the people. It appears, however, that the name Maneros\r\nis due to a misunderstanding of the formula _maa-ne-hra,_ "Come to\r\nthe house," which has been discovered in various Egyptian writings,\r\nfor example in the dirge of Isis in the Book of the Dead. Hence we\r\nmay suppose that the cry _maa-ne-hra_ was chanted by the reapers\r\nover the cut corn as a dirge for the death of the corn-spirit (Isis\r\nor Osiris) and a prayer for its return. As the cry was raised over\r\nthe first ears reaped, it would seem that the corn-spirit was\r\nbelieved by the Egyptians to be present in the first corn cut and to\r\ndie under the sickle. We have seen that in the Malay Peninsula and\r\nJava the first ears of rice are taken to represent either the Soul\r\nof the Rice or the Rice-bride and the Rice-bridegroom. In parts of\r\nRussia the first sheaf is treated much in the same way that the last\r\nsheaf is treated elsewhere. It is reaped by the mistress herself,\r\ntaken home and set in the place of honour near the holy pictures;\r\nafterwards it is threshed separately, and some of its grain is mixed\r\nwith the next year\'s seed-corn. In Aberdeenshire, while the last\r\ncorn cut was generally used to make the _clyack_ sheaf, it was\r\nsometimes, though rarely, the first corn cut that was dressed up as\r\na woman and carried home with ceremony.\r\n\r\nIn Phoenicia and Western Asia a plaintive song, like that chanted by\r\nthe Egyptian corn-reapers, was sung at the vintage and probably (to\r\njudge by analogy) also at harvest. This Phoenician song was called\r\nby the Greeks Linus or Ailinus and explained, like Maneros, as a\r\nlament for the death of a youth named Linus. According to one story\r\nLinus was brought up by a shepherd, but torn to pieces by his dogs.\r\nBut, like Maneros, the name Linus or Ailinus appears to have\r\noriginated in a verbal misunderstanding, and to be nothing more than\r\nthe cry _ai lanu,_ that is "Woe to us," which the Phoenicians\r\nprobably uttered in mourning for Adonis; at least Sappho seems to\r\nhave regarded Adonis and Linus as equivalent.\r\n\r\nIn Bithynia a like mournful ditty, called Bormus or Borimus, was\r\nchanted by Mariandynian reapers. Bormus was said to have been a\r\nhandsome youth, the son of King Upias or of a wealthy and\r\ndistinguished man. One summer day, watching the reapers at work in\r\nhis fields, he went to fetch them a drink of water and was never\r\nheard of more. So the reapers sought for him, calling him in\r\nplaintive strains, which they continued to chant at harvest ever\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Killing the Corn-spirit\r\n\r\nIN PHRYGIA the corresponding song, sung by harvesters both at\r\nreaping and at threshing, was called Lityerses. According to one\r\nstory, Lityerses was a bastard son of Midas, King of Phrygia, and\r\ndwelt at Celaenae. He used to reap the corn, and had an enormous\r\nappetite. When a stranger happened to enter the corn-field or to\r\npass by it, Lityerses gave him plenty to eat and drink, then took\r\nhim to the corn-fields on the banks of the Maeander and compelled\r\nhim to reap along with him. Lastly, it was his custom to wrap the\r\nstranger in a sheaf, cut off his head with a sickle, and carry away\r\nhis body, swathed in the corn-stalks. But at last Hercules undertook\r\nto reap with him, cut off his head with the sickle, and threw his\r\nbody into the river. As Hercules is reported to have slain Lityerses\r\nin the same way that Lityerses slew others, we may infer that\r\nLityerses used to throw the bodies of his victims into the river.\r\nAccording to another version of the story, Lityerses, a son of\r\nMidas, was wont to challenge people to a reaping match with him, and\r\nif he vanquished them he used to thrash them; but one day he met\r\nwith a stronger reaper, who slew him.\r\n\r\nThere are some grounds for supposing that in these stories of\r\nLityerses we have the description of a Phrygian harvest custom in\r\naccordance with which certain persons, especially strangers passing\r\nthe harvest field, were regularly regarded as embodiments of the\r\ncorn-spirit, and as such were seized by the reapers, wrapt in\r\nsheaves, and beheaded, their bodies, bound up in the corn-stalks,\r\nbeing after-wards thrown into water as a rain-charm. The grounds for\r\nthis supposition are, first, the resemblance of the Lityerses story\r\nto the harvest customs of European peasantry, and, second, the\r\nfrequency of human sacrifices offered by savage races to promote the\r\nfertility of the fields. We will examine these grounds successively,\r\nbeginning with the former.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the story with the harvest customs of Europe, three\r\npoints deserve special attention, namely: I. the reaping match and\r\nthe binding of persons in the sheaves; II. the killing of the\r\ncorn-spirit or his representatives; III. the treatment of visitors\r\nto the harvest field or of strangers passing it.\r\n\r\nI. In regard to the first head, we have seen that in modern Europe\r\nthe person who cuts or binds or threshes the last sheaf is often\r\nexposed to rough treatment at the hands of his fellow-labourers. For\r\nexample, he is bound up in the last sheaf, and, thus encased, is\r\ncarried or carted about, beaten, drenched with water, thrown on a\r\ndunghill, and so forth. Or, if he is spared this horse-play, he is\r\nat least the subject of ridicule or is thought to be destined to\r\nsuffer some misfortune in the course of the year. Hence the\r\nharvesters are naturally reluctant to give the last cut at reaping\r\nor the last stroke at threshing or to bind the last sheaf, and\r\ntowards the close of the work this reluctance produces an emulation\r\namong the labourers, each striving to finish his task as fast as\r\npossible, in order that he may escape the invidious distinction of\r\nbeing last. For example, in the Mittelmark district of Prussia, when\r\nthe rye has been reaped, and the last sheaves are about to be tied\r\nup, the binders stand in two rows facing each other, every woman\r\nwith her sheaf and her straw rope before her. At a given signal they\r\nall tie up their sheaves, and the one who is the last to finish is\r\nridiculed by the rest. Not only so, but her sheaf is made up into\r\nhuman shape and called the Old Man, and she must carry it home to\r\nthe farmyard, where the harvesters dance in a circle round her and\r\nit. Then they take the Old Man to the farmer and deliver it to him\r\nwith the words, "We bring the Old Man to the Master. He may keep him\r\ntill he gets a new one." After that the Old Man is set up against a\r\ntree, where he remains for a long time, the butt of many jests. At\r\nAschbach in Bavaria, when the reaping is nearly finished, the\r\nreapers say, "Now, we will drive out the Old Man." Each of them sets\r\nhimself to reap a patch of corn as fast as he can; he who cuts the\r\nlast handful or the last stalk is greeted by the rest with an\r\nexulting cry, "You have the Old Man." Sometimes a black mask is\r\nfastened on the reaper\'s face and he is dressed in woman\'s clothes;\r\nor if the reaper is a woman, she is dressed in man\'s clothes. A\r\ndance follows. At the supper the Old Man gets twice as large a\r\nportion of the food as the others. The proceedings are similar at\r\nthreshing; the person who gives the last stroke is said to have the\r\nOld Man. At the supper given to the threshers he has to eat out of\r\nthe cream-ladle and to drink a great deal. Moreover, he is quizzed\r\nand teased in all sorts of ways till he frees himself from further\r\nannoyance by treating the others to brandy or beer.\r\n\r\nThese examples illustrate the contests in reaping, threshing, and\r\nbinding which take place amongst the harvesters, from their\r\nunwillingness to suffer the ridicule and discomfort incurred by the\r\none who happens to finish his work last. It will be remembered that\r\nthe person who is last at reaping, binding, or threshing, is\r\nregarded as the representative of the corn-spirit, and this idea is\r\nmore fully expressed by binding him or her in corn-stalks. The\r\nlatter custom has been already illustrated, but a few more instances\r\nmay be added. At Kloxin, near Stettin, the harvesters call out to\r\nthe woman who binds the last sheaf, "You have the Old Man, and must\r\nkeep him." As late as the first half of the nineteenth century the\r\ncustom was to tie up the woman herself in pease-straw, and bring her\r\nwith music to the farmhouse, where the harvesters danced with her\r\ntill the pease-straw fell off. In other villages round Stettin, when\r\nthe last harvest-waggon is being loaded, there is a regular race\r\namongst the women, each striving not to be last. For she who places\r\nthe last sheaf on the waggon is called the Old Man, and is\r\ncompletely swathed in corn-stalks; she is also decked with flowers,\r\nand flowers and a helmet of straw are placed on her head. In solemn\r\nprocession she carries the harvest-crown to the squire, over whose\r\nhead she holds it while she utters a string of good wishes. At the\r\ndance which follows, the Old Man has the right to choose his, or\r\nrather her, partner; it is an honour to dance with him. At Gommern,\r\nnear Magdeburg, the reaper who cuts the last ears of corn is often\r\nwrapt up in corn-stalks so completely that it is hard to see whether\r\nthere is a man in the bundle or not. Thus wrapt up he is taken by\r\nanother stalwart reaper on his back, and carried round the field\r\namidst the joyous cries of the harvesters. At Neuhausen, near\r\nMerseburg, the person who binds the last sheaf is wrapt in ears of\r\noats and saluted as the Oatsman, whereupon the others dance round\r\nhim. At Brie, Isle de France, the farmer himself is tied up in the\r\n_first_ sheaf. At Dingelstedt, in the district of Erfurt, down to\r\nthe first half of the nineteenth century it was the custom to tie up\r\na man in the last sheaf. He was called the Old Man, and was brought\r\nhome on the last waggon, amid huzzas and music. On reaching the\r\nfarmyard he was rolled round the barn and drenched with water. At\r\nN\xf6rdlingen in Bavaria the man who gives the last stroke at threshing\r\nis wrapt in straw and rolled on the threshing-floor. In some parts\r\nof Oberpfalz, Bavaria, he is said to "get the Old Man," is wrapt in\r\nstraw, and carried to a neighbour who has not yet finished his\r\nthreshing. In Silesia the woman who binds the last sheaf has to\r\nsubmit to a good deal of horse-play. She is pushed, knocked down,\r\nand tied up in the sheaf, after which she is called the corn-puppet\r\n(_Kornpopel_).\r\n\r\n"In all these cases the idea is that the spirit of the corn--the Old\r\nMan of vegetation--is driven out of the corn last cut or last\r\nthreshed, and lives in the barn during the winter. At sowing-time he\r\ngoes out again to the fields to resume his activity as animating\r\nforce among the sprouting corn."\r\n\r\nII. Passing to the second point of comparison between the Lityerses\r\nstory and European harvest customs, we have now to see that in the\r\nlatter the corn-spirit is often believed to be killed at reaping or\r\nthreshing. In the Romsdal and other parts of Norway, when the\r\nhaymaking is over, the people say that "the Old Hay-man has been\r\nkilled." In some parts of Bavaria the man who gives the last stroke\r\nat threshing is said to have killed the Corn-man, the Oats-man, or\r\nthe Wheat-man, according to the crop. In the Canton of Tillot, in\r\nLorraine, at threshing the last corn the men keep time with their\r\nflails, calling out as they thresh, "We are killing the Old Woman!\r\nWe are killing the Old Woman!" If there is an old woman in the house\r\nshe is warned to save herself, or she will be struck dead. Near\r\nRagnit, in Lithuania, the last handful of corn is left standing by\r\nitself, with the words, "The Old Woman (_Boba_) is sitting in\r\nthere." Then a young reaper whets his scythe and, with a strong\r\nsweep, cuts down the handful. It is now said of him that "he has cut\r\noff the Boba\'s head"; and he receives a gratuity from the farmer and\r\na jugful of water over his head from the farmer\'s wife. According to\r\nanother account, every Lithuanian reaper makes haste to finish his\r\ntask; for the Old Rye-woman lives in the last stalks, and whoever\r\ncuts the last stalks kills the Old Rye-woman, and by killing her he\r\nbrings trouble on himself. In Wilkischken, in the district of\r\nTilsit, the man who cuts the last corn goes by the name of "the\r\nkiller of the Rye-woman." In Lithuania, again, the corn-spirit is\r\nbelieved to be killed at threshing as well as at reaping. When only\r\na single pile of corn remains to be threshed, all the threshers\r\nsuddenly step back a few paces, as if at the word of command. Then\r\nthey fall to work, plying their flails with the utmost rapidity and\r\nvehemence, till they come to the last bundle. Upon this they fling\r\nthemselves with almost frantic fury, straining every nerve, and\r\nraining blows on it till the word "Halt!" rings out sharply from the\r\nleader. The man whose flail is the last to fall after the command to\r\nstop has been given is immediately surrounded by all the rest,\r\ncrying out that "he has struck the Old Rye-woman dead." He has to\r\nexpiate the deed by treating them to brandy; and, like the man who\r\ncuts the last corn, he is known as "the killer of the Old\r\nRye-woman." Sometimes in Lithuania the slain corn-spirit was\r\nrepresented by a puppet. Thus a female figure was made out of\r\ncorn-stalks, dressed in clothes, and placed on the threshing-floor,\r\nunder the heap of corn which was to be threshed last. Whoever\r\nthereafter gave the last stroke at threshing "struck the Old Woman\r\ndead." We have already met with examples of burning the figure which\r\nrepresents the corn-spirit. In the East Riding of Yorkshire a custom\r\ncalled "burning the Old Witch" is observed on the last day of\r\nharvest. A small sheaf of corn is burnt on the field in a fire of\r\nstubble; peas are parched at the fire and eaten with a liberal\r\nallowance of ale; and the lads and lasses romp about the flames and\r\namuse themselves by blackening each other\'s faces. Sometimes, again,\r\nthe corn-spirit is represented by a man, who lies down under the\r\nlast corn; it is threshed upon his body, and the people say that\r\n"the Old Man is being beaten to death." We saw that sometimes the\r\nfarmer\'s wife is thrust, together with the last sheaf, under the\r\nthreshing-machine, as if to thresh her, and that afterwards a\r\npretence is made of winnowing her. At Volders, in the Tyrol, husks\r\nof corn are stuck behind the neck of the man who gives the last\r\nstroke at threshing, and he is throttled with a straw garland. If he\r\nis tall, it is believed that the corn will be tall next year. Then\r\nhe is tied on a bundle and flung into the river. In Carinthia, the\r\nthresher who gave the last stroke, and the person who untied the\r\nlast sheaf on the threshing-floor, are bound hand and foot with\r\nstraw bands, and crowns of straw are placed on their heads. Then\r\nthey are tied, face to face, on a sledge, dragged through the\r\nvillage, and flung into a brook. The custom of throwing the\r\nrepresentative of the corn-spirit into a stream, like that of\r\ndrenching him with water, is, as usual, a rain-charm.\r\n\r\nIII. Thus far the representatives of the corn-spirit have generally\r\nbeen the man or woman who cuts, binds, or threshes the last corn. We\r\nnow come to the cases in which the corn-spirit is represented either\r\nby a stranger passing the harvest-field (as in the Lityerses tale),\r\nor by a visitor entering it for the first time. All over Germany it\r\nis customary for the reapers or threshers to lay hold of passing\r\nstrangers and bind them with a rope made of corn-stalks, till they\r\npay a forfeit; and when the farmer himself or one of his guests\r\nenters the field or the threshing-floor for the first time, he is\r\ntreated in the same way. Sometimes the rope is only tied round his\r\narm or his feet or his neck. But sometimes he is regularly swathed\r\nin corn. Thus at Sol\xf6r in Norway, whoever enters the field, be he\r\nthe master or a stranger, is tied up in a sheaf and must pay a\r\nransom. In the neighbourhood of Soest, when the farmer visits the\r\nflax-pullers for the first time, he is completely enveloped in flax.\r\nPassers-by are also surrounded by the women, tied up in flax, and\r\ncompelled to stand brandy. At N\xf6rdlingen strangers are caught with\r\nstraw ropes and tied up in a sheaf till they pay a forfeit. Among\r\nthe Germans of Haselberg, in West Bohemia, as soon as a farmer had\r\ngiven the last corn to be threshed on the threshing-floor, he was\r\nswathed in it and had to redeem himself by a present of cakes. In\r\nthe canton of Putanges, in Normandy, a pretence of tying up the\r\nowner of the land in the last sheaf of wheat is still practised, or\r\nat least was still practised some quarter of a century ago. The task\r\nfalls to the women alone. They throw themselves on the proprietor,\r\nseize him by the arms, the legs, and the body, throw him to the\r\nground, and stretch him on the last sheaf. Then a show is made of\r\nbinding him, and the conditions to be observed at the harvest-supper\r\nare dictated to him. When he has accepted them, he is released and\r\nallowed to get up. At Brie, Isle de France, when any one who does\r\nnot belong to the farm passes by the harvest-field, the reapers give\r\nchase. If they catch him, they bind him in a sheaf an dbite him, one\r\nafter the other, in the forehead, crying, "You shall carry the key\r\nof the field." "To have the key" is an expression used by harvesters\r\nelsewhere in the sense of to cut or bind or thresh the last sheaf;\r\nhence, it is equivalent to the phrases "You have the Old Man," "You\r\nare the Old Man," which are addressed to the cutter, binder, or\r\nthresher of the last sheaf. Therefore, when a stranger, as at Brie,\r\nis tied up in a sheaf and told that he will "carry the key of the\r\nfield," it is as much as to say that he is the Old Man, that is, an\r\nembodiment of the corn-spirit. In hop-picking, if a well-dressed\r\nstranger passes the hop-yard, he is seized by the women, tumbled\r\ninto the bin, covered with leaves, and not released till he has paid\r\na fine.\r\n\r\nThus, like the ancient Lityerses, modern European reapers have been\r\nwont to lay hold of a passing stranger and tie him up in a sheaf. It\r\nis not to be expected that they should complete the parallel by\r\ncutting off his head; but if they do not take such a strong step,\r\ntheir language and gestures are at least indicative of a desire to\r\ndo so. For instance, in Mecklenburg on the first day of reaping, if\r\nthe master or mistress or a stranger enters the field, or merely\r\npasses by it, all the mowers face towards him and sharpen their\r\nscythes, clashing their whet-stones against them in unison, as if\r\nthey were making ready to mow. Then the woman who leads the mowers\r\nsteps up to him and ties a band round his left arm. He must ransom\r\nhimself by payment of a forfeit. Near Ratzeburg, when the master or\r\nother person of mark enters the field or passes by it, all the\r\nharvesters stop work and march towards him in a body, the men with\r\ntheir scythes in front. On meeting him they form up in line, men and\r\nwomen. The men stick the poles of their scythes in the ground, as\r\nthey do in whetting them; then they take off their caps and hang\r\nthem on the scythes, while their leader stands forward and makes a\r\nspeech. When he has done, they all whet their scythes in measured\r\ntime very loudly, after which they put on their caps. Two of the\r\nwomen binders then come forward; one of them ties the master or\r\nstranger (as the case may be) with corn-ears or with a silken band;\r\nthe other delivers a rhyming address. The following are specimens of\r\nthe speeches made by the reaper on these occasions. In some parts of\r\nPomerania every passer-by is stopped, his way being barred with a\r\ncorn-rope. The reapers form a circle round him and sharpen their\r\nscythes, while their leader says:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "The men are ready,\r\n    The scythes are bent,\r\n    The corn is great and small,\r\n    The gentleman must be mowed."\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the process of whetting the scythes is repeated. At Ramin, in\r\nthe district of Stettin, the stranger, standing encircled by the\r\nreapers, is thus addressed:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "We\'ll stroke the gentleman\r\n    With our naked sword,\r\n    Wherewith we shear meadows and fields.\r\n    We shear princes and lords.\r\n    Labourers are often athirst;\r\n    If the gentleman will stand beer and brandy\r\n    The joke will soon be over.\r\n    But, if our prayer he does not like,\r\n    The sword has a right to strike."\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the threshing-floor strangers are also regarded as embodiments of\r\nthe corn-spirit, and are treated accordingly. At Wiedingharde in\r\nSchleswig when a stranger comes to the threshing-floor he is asked,\r\n"Shall I teach you the flail-dance?" If he says yes, they put the\r\narms of the threshing-flail round his neck as if he were a sheaf of\r\ncorn, and press them together so tight that he is nearly choked. In\r\nsome parishes of Wermland (Sweden), when a stranger enters the\r\nthreshing-floor where the threshers are at work, they say that "they\r\nwill teach him the threshing-song." Then they put a flail round his\r\nneck and a straw rope about his body. Also, as we have seen, if a\r\nstranger woman enters the threshing-floor, the threshers put a flail\r\nround her body and a wreath of corn-stalks round her neck, and call\r\nout, "See the Corn-woman! See! that is how the Corn-maiden looks!"\r\n\r\nThus in these harvest-customs of modern Europe the person who cuts,\r\nbinds, or threshes the last corn is treated as an embodiment of the\r\ncorn-spirit by being wrapt up in sheaves, killed in mimicry by\r\nagricultural implements, and thrown into the water. These\r\ncoincidences with the Lityerses story seem to prove that the latter\r\nis a genuine description of an old Phrygian harvest-custom. But\r\nsince in the modern parallels the killing of the personal\r\nrepresentative of the corn-spirit is necessarily omitted or at most\r\nenacted only in mimicry, it is desirable to show that in rude\r\nsociety human beings have been commonly killed as an agricultural\r\nceremony to promote the fertility of the fields. The following\r\nexamples will make this plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Human Sacrifices for the Crops\r\n\r\nTHE INDIANS of Guayaquil, in Ecuador, used to sacrifice human blood\r\nand the hearts of men when they sowed their fields. The people of\r\nCa\xf1ar (now Cuenca in Ecuador) used to sacrifice a hundred children\r\nannually at harvest. The kings of Quito, the Incas of Peru, and for\r\na long time the Spaniards were unable to suppress the bloody rite.\r\nAt a Mexican harvest-festival, when the first-fruits of the season\r\nwere offered to the sun, a criminal was placed between two immense\r\nstones, balanced opposite each other, and was crushed by them as\r\nthey fell together. His remains were buried, and a feast and dance\r\nfollowed. This sacrifice was known as "the meeting of the stones."\r\nWe have seen that the ancient Mexicans also sacrificed human beings\r\nat all the various stages in the growth of the maize, the age of the\r\nvictims corresponding to the age of the corn; for they sacrificed\r\nnew-born babes at sowing, older children when the grain had\r\nsprouted, and so on till it was fully ripe, when they sacrificed old\r\nmen. No doubt the correspondence between the ages of the victims and\r\nthe state of the corn was supposed to enhance the efficacy of the\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe Pawnees annually sacrificed a human victim in spring when they\r\nsowed their fields. The sacrifice was believed to have been enjoined\r\non them by the Morning Star, or by a certain bird which the Morning\r\nStar had sent to them as its messenger. The bird was stuffed and\r\npreserved as a powerful talisman. They thought that an omission of\r\nthis sacrifice would be followed by the total failure of the crops\r\nof maize, beans, and pumpkins. The victim was a captive of either\r\nsex. He was clad in the gayest and most costly attire, was fattened\r\non the choicest food, and carefully kept in ignorance of his doom.\r\nWhen he was fat enough, they bound him to a cross in the presence of\r\nthe multitude, danced a solemn dance, then cleft his head with a\r\ntomahawk and shot him with arrows. According to one trader, the\r\nsquaws then cut pieces of flesh from the victim\'s body, with which\r\nthey greased their hoes; but this was denied by another trader who\r\nhad been present at the ceremony. Immediately after the sacrifice\r\nthe people proceeded to plant their fields. A particular account has\r\nbeen preserved of the sacrifice of a Sioux girl by the Pawnees in\r\nApril 1837 or 1838. The girl was fourteen or fifteen years old and\r\nhad been kept for six months and well treated. Two days before the\r\nsacrifice she was led from wigwam to wigwam, accompanied by the\r\nwhole council of chiefs and warriors. At each lodge she received a\r\nsmall billet of wood and a little paint, which she handed to the\r\nwarrior next to her. In this way she called at every wigwam,\r\nreceiving at each the same present of wood and paint. On the\r\ntwenty-second of April she was taken out to be sacrificed, attended\r\nby the warriors, each of whom carried two pieces of wood which he\r\nhad received from her hands. Her body having been painted half red\r\nand half black, she was attached to a sort of gibbet and roasted for\r\nsome time over a slow fire, then shot to death with arrows. The\r\nchief sacrificer next tore out her heart and devoured it. While her\r\nflesh was still warm it was cut in small pieces from the bones, put\r\nin little baskets, and taken to a neighbouring corn-field. There the\r\nhead chief took a piece of the flesh from a basket and squeezed a\r\ndrop of blood upon the newly-deposited grains of corn. His example\r\nwas followed by the rest, till all the seed had been sprinkled with\r\nthe blood; it was then covered up with earth. According to one\r\naccount the body of the victim was reduced to a kind of paste, which\r\nwas rubbed or sprinkled not only on the maize but also on the\r\npotatoes, the beans, and other seeds to fertilise them. By this\r\nsacrifice they hoped to obtain plentiful crops.\r\n\r\nA West African queen used to sacrifice a man and woman in the month\r\nof March. They were killed with spades and hoes, and their bodies\r\nburied in the middle of a field which had just been tilled. At Lagos\r\nin Guinea it was the custom annually to impale a young girl alive\r\nsoon after the spring equinox in order to secure good crops. Along\r\nwith her were sacrificed sheep and goats, which, with yams, heads of\r\nmaize, and plantains, were hung on stakes on each side of her. The\r\nvictims were bred up for the purpose in the king\'s seraglio, and\r\ntheir minds had been so powerfully wrought upon by the fetish men\r\nthat they went cheerfully to their fate. A similar sacrifice used to\r\nbe annually offered at Benin, in Guinea. The Marimos, a Bechuana\r\ntribe, sacrifice a human being for the crops. The victim chosen is\r\ngenerally a short, stout man. He is seized by violence or\r\nintoxicated and taken to the fields, where he is killed amongst the\r\nwheat to serve as "seed" (so they phrase it). After his blood has\r\ncoagulated in the sun, it is burned along with the frontal bone, the\r\nflesh attached to it, and the brain; the ashes are then scattered\r\nover the ground to fertilise it. The rest of the body is eaten.\r\n\r\nThe Bagobos of Mindanao, one of the Philippine Islands, offer a\r\nhuman sacrifice before they sow their rice. The victim is a slave,\r\nwho is hewn to pieces in the forest. The natives of Bontoc in the\r\ninterior of Luzon, one of the Philippine Islands, are passionate\r\nhead-hunters. Their principal seasons for head-hunting are the times\r\nof planting and reaping the rice. In order that the crop may turn\r\nout well, every farm must get at least one human head at planting\r\nand one at sowing. The head-hunters go out in twos or threes, lie in\r\nwait for the victim, whether man or woman, cut off his or her head,\r\nhands, and feet, and bring them back in haste to the village, where\r\nthey are received with great rejoicings. The skulls are at first\r\nexposed on the branches of two or three dead trees which stand in an\r\nopen space of every village surrounded by large stones which serve\r\nas seats. The people then dance round them and feast and get drunk.\r\nWhen the flesh has decayed from the head, the man who cut it off\r\ntakes it home and preserves it as a relic, while his companions do\r\nthe same with the hands and the feet. Similar customs are observed\r\nby the Apoyaos, another tribe in the interior of Luzon.\r\n\r\nAmong the Lhota Naga, one of the many savage tribes who inhabit the\r\ndeep rugged labyrinthine glens which wind into the mountains from\r\nthe rich valley of Brahmapootra, it used to be a common custom to\r\nchop off the heads, hands, and feet of people they met with, and\r\nthen to stick up the severed extremities in their fields to ensure a\r\ngood crop of grain. They bore no ill-will whatever to the persons\r\nupon whom they operated in this unceremonious fashion. Once they\r\nflayed a boy alive, carved him in pieces, and distributed the flesh\r\namong all the villagers, who put it into their corn-bins to avert\r\nbad luck and ensure plentiful crops of grain. The Gonds of India, a\r\nDravidian race, kidnapped Brahman boys, and kept them as victims to\r\nbe sacrificed on various occasions. At sowing and reaping, after a\r\ntriumphal procession, one of the lads was slain by being punctured\r\nwith a poisoned arrow. His blood was then sprinkled over the\r\nploughed field or the ripe crop, and his flesh was devoured. The\r\nOraons or Uraons of Chota Nagpur worship a goddess called Anna\r\nKuari, who can give good crops and make a man rich, but to induce\r\nher to do so it is necessary to offer human sacrifices. In spite of\r\nthe vigilance of the British Government these sacrifices are said to\r\nbe still secretly perpetrated. The victims are poor waifs and strays\r\nwhose disappearance attracts no notice. April and May are the months\r\nwhen the catchpoles are out on the prowl. At that time strangers\r\nwill not go about the country alone, and parents will not let their\r\nchildren enter the jungle or herd the cattle. When a catchpole has\r\nfound a victim, he cuts his throat and carries away the upper part\r\nof the ring finger and the nose. The goddess takes up her abode in\r\nthe house of any man who has offered her a sacrifice, and from that\r\ntime his fields yield a double harvest. The form she assumes in the\r\nhouse is that of a small child. When the householder brings in his\r\nunhusked rice, he takes the goddess and rolls her over the heap to\r\ndouble its size. But she soon grows restless and can only be\r\npacified with the blood of fresh human victims.\r\n\r\nBut the best known case of human sacrifices, systematically offered\r\nto ensure good crops, is supplied by the Khonds or Kandhs, another\r\nDravidian race in Bengal. Our knowledge of them is derived from the\r\naccounts written by British officers who, about the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century, were engaged in putting them down. The\r\nsacrifices were offered to the Earth Goddess. Tari Pennu or Bera\r\nPennu, and were believed to ensure good crops and immunity from all\r\ndisease and accidents. In particular, they were considered necessary\r\nin the cultivation of turmeric, the Khonds arguing that the turmeric\r\ncould not have a deep red colour without the shedding of blood. The\r\nvictim or Meriah, as he was called, was acceptable to the goddess\r\nonly if he had been purchased, or had been born a victim--that is,\r\nthe son of a victim father, or had been devoted as a child by his\r\nfather or guardian. Khonds in distress often sold their children for\r\nvictims, "considering the beatification of their souls certain, and\r\ntheir death, for the benefit of mankind, the most honourable\r\npossible." A man of the Panua tribe was once seen to load a Khond\r\nwith curses, and finally to spit in his face, because the Khond had\r\nsold for a victim his own child, whom the Panua had wished to marry.\r\nA party of Khonds, who saw this, immediately pressed forward to\r\ncomfort the seller of his child, saying, "Your child has died that\r\nall the world may live, and the Earth Goddess herself will wipe that\r\nspittle from your face." The victims were often kept for years\r\nbefore they were sacrificed. Being regarded as consecrated beings,\r\nthey were treated with extreme affection, mingled with deference,\r\nand were welcomed wherever they went. A Meriah youth, on attaining\r\nmaturity, was generally given a wife, who was herself usually a\r\nMeriah or victim; and with her he received a portion of land and\r\nfarm-stock. Their offspring were also victims. Human sacrifices were\r\noffered to the Earth Goddess by tribes, branches of tribes, or\r\nvillages, both at periodical festivals and on extraordinary\r\noccasions. The periodical sacrifices were generally so arranged by\r\ntribes and divisions of tribes that each head of a family was\r\nenabled, at least once a year, to procure a shred of flesh for his\r\nfields, generally about the time when his chief crop was laid down.\r\n\r\nThe mode of performing these tribal sacrifices was as follows. Ten\r\nor twelve days before the sacrifice, the victim was devoted by\r\ncutting off his hair, which, until then, had been kept unshorn.\r\nCrowds of men and women assembled to witness the sacrifice; none\r\nmight be excluded, since the sacrifice was declared to be for all\r\nmankind. It was preceded by several days of wild revelry and gross\r\ndebauchery. On the day before the sacrifice the victim, dressed in a\r\nnew garment, was led forth from the village in solemn procession,\r\nwith music and dancing, to the Meriah grove, a clump of high forest\r\ntrees standing a little way from the village and untouched by the\r\naxe. There they tied him to a post, which was sometimes placed\r\nbetween two plants of the sankissar shrub. He was then anointed with\r\noil, ghee, and turmeric, and adorned with flowers; and "a species of\r\nreverence, which it is not easy to distinguish from adoration," was\r\npaid to him throughout the day. A great struggle now arose to obtain\r\nthe smallest relic from his person; a particle of the turmeric paste\r\nwith which he was smeared, or a drop of his spittle, was esteemed of\r\nsovereign virtue, especially by the women. The crowd danced round\r\nthe post to music, and addressing the earth, said, "O God, we offer\r\nthis sacrifice to you; give us good crops, seasons, and health";\r\nthen speaking to the victim they said, "We bought you with a price,\r\nand did not seize you; now we sacrifice you according to custom, and\r\nno sin rests with us."\r\n\r\nOn the last morning the orgies, which had been scarcely interrupted\r\nduring the night, were resumed, and continued till noon, when they\r\nceased, and the assembly proceeded to consummate the sacrifice. The\r\nvictim was again anointed with oil, and each person touched the\r\nanointed part, and wiped the oil on his own head. In some places\r\nthey took the victim in procession round the village, from door to\r\ndoor, where some plucked hair from his head, and others begged for a\r\ndrop of his spittle, with which they anointed their heads. As the\r\nvictim might not be bound nor make any show of resistance, the bones\r\nof his arms and, if necessary, his legs were broken; but often this\r\nprecaution was rendered unnecessary by stupefying him with opium.\r\nThe mode of putting him to death varied in different places. One of\r\nthe commonest modes seems to have been strangulation, or squeezing\r\nto death. The branch of a green tree was cleft several feet down the\r\nmiddle; the victim\'s neck (in other places, his chest) was inserted\r\nin the cleft, which the priest, aided by his assistants, strove with\r\nall his force to close. Then he wounded the victim slightly with his\r\naxe, whereupon the crowd rushed at the wretch and hewed the flesh\r\nfrom the bones, leaving the head and bowels untouched. Sometimes he\r\nwas cut up alive. In Chinna Kimedy he was dragged along the fields,\r\nsurrounded by the crowd, who, avoiding his head and intestines,\r\nhacked the flesh from his body with their knives till he died.\r\nAnother very common mode of sacrifice in the same district was to\r\nfasten the victim to the proboscis of a wooden elephant, which\r\nrevolved on a stout post, and, as it whirled round, the crowd cut\r\nthe flesh from the victim while life remained. In some villages\r\nMajor Campbell found as many as fourteen of these wooden elephants,\r\nwhich had been used at sacrifices. In one district the victim was\r\nput to death slowly by fire. A low stage was formed, sloping on\r\neither side like a roof; upon it they laid the victim, his limbs\r\nwound round with cords to confine his struggles. Fires were then\r\nlighted and hot brands applied, to make him roll up and down the\r\nslopes of the stage as long as possible; for the more tears he shed\r\nthe more abundant would be the supply of rain. Next day the body was\r\ncut to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe flesh cut from the victim was instantly taken home by the\r\npersons who had been deputed by each village to bring it. To secure\r\nits rapid arrival, it was sometimes forwarded by relays of men, and\r\nconveyed with postal fleetness fifty or sixty miles. In each village\r\nall who stayed at home fasted rigidly until the flesh arrived. The\r\nbearer deposited it in the place of public assembly, where it was\r\nreceived by the priest and the heads of families. The priest divided\r\nit into two portions, one of which he offered to the Earth Goddess\r\nby burying it in a hole in the ground with his back turned, and\r\nwithout looking. Then each man added a little earth to bury it, and\r\nthe priest poured water on the spot from a hill gourd. The other\r\nportion of flesh he divided into as many shares as there were heads\r\nof houses present. Each head of a house rolled his shred of flesh in\r\nleaves, and buried it in his favourite field, placing it in the\r\nearth behind his back without looking. In some places each man\r\ncarried his portion of flesh to the stream which watered his fields,\r\nand there hung it on a pole. For three days thereafter no house was\r\nswept; and, in one district, strict silence was observed, no fire\r\nmight be given out, no wood cut, and no strangers received. The\r\nremains of the human victim (namely, the head, bowels, and bones)\r\nwere watched by strong parties the night after the sacrifice; and\r\nnext morning they were burned, along with a whole sheep, on a\r\nfuneral pile. The ashes were scattered over the fields, laid as\r\npaste over the houses and granaries, or mixed with the new corn to\r\npreserve it from insects. Sometimes, however, the head and bones\r\nwere buried, not burnt. After the suppression of the human\r\nsacrifices, inferior victims were substituted in some places; for\r\ninstance, in the capital of Chinna Kimedy a goat took the place of\r\nthe human victim. Others sacrifice a buffalo. They tie it to a\r\nwooden post in a sacred grove, dance wildly round it with brandished\r\nknives, then, falling on the living animal, hack it to shreds and\r\ntatters in a few minutes, fighting and struggling with each other\r\nfor every particle of flesh. As soon as a man has secured a piece he\r\nmakes off with it at full speed to bury it in his fields, according\r\nto ancient custom, before the sun has set, and as some of them have\r\nfar to go they must run very fast. All the women throw clods of\r\nearth at the rapidly retreating figures of the men, some of them\r\ntaking very good aim. Soon the sacred grove, so lately a scene of\r\ntumult, is silent and deserted except for a few people who remain to\r\nguard all that is left of the buffalo, to wit, the head, the bones,\r\nand the stomach, which are burned with ceremony at the foot of the\r\nstake.\r\n\r\nIn these Khond sacrifices the Meriahs are represented by our\r\nauthorities as victims offered to propitiate the Earth Goddess. But\r\nfrom the treatment of the victims both before and after death it\r\nappears that the custom cannot be explained as merely a propitiatory\r\nsacrifice. A part of the flesh certainly was offered to the Earth\r\nGoddess, but the rest was buried by each householder in his fields,\r\nand the ashes of the other parts of the body were scattered over the\r\nfields, laid as paste on the granaries, or mixed with the new corn.\r\nThese latter customs imply that to the body of the Meriah there was\r\nascribed a direct or intrinsic power of making the crops to grow,\r\nquite independent of the indirect efficacy which it might have as an\r\noffering to secure the good-will of the deity. In other words, the\r\nflesh and ashes of the victim were believed to be endowed with a\r\nmagical or physical power of fertilising the land. The same\r\nintrinsic power was ascribed to the blood and tears of the Meriah,\r\nhis blood causing the redness of the turmeric and his tears\r\nproducing rain; for it can hardly be doubted that, originally at\r\nleast, the tears were supposed to bring down the rain, not merely to\r\nprognosticate it. Similarly the custom of pouring water on the\r\nburied flesh of the Meriah was no doubt a rain-charm. Again, magical\r\npower as an attribute of the Meriah appears in the sovereign virtue\r\nbelieved to reside in anything that came from his person, as his\r\nhair or spittle. The ascription of such power to the Meriah\r\nindicates that he was much more than a mere man sacrificed to\r\npropitiate a deity. Once more, the extreme reverence paid him points\r\nto the same conclusion. Major Campbell speaks of the Meriah as\r\n"being regarded as something more than mortal," and Major Macpherson\r\nsays, "A species of reverence, which it is not easy to distinguish\r\nfrom adoration, is paid to him." In short, the Meriah seems to have\r\nbeen regarded as divine. As such, he may originally have represented\r\nthe Earth Goddess or, perhaps, a deity of vegetation; though in\r\nlater times he came to be regarded rather as a victim offered to a\r\ndeity than as himself an incarnate god. This later view of the\r\nMeriah as a victim rather than a divinity may perhaps have received\r\nundue emphasis from the European writers who have described the\r\nKhond religion. Habituated to the later idea of sacrifice as an\r\noffering made to a god for the purpose of conciliating his favour,\r\nEuropean observers are apt to interpret all religious slaughter in\r\nthis sense, and to suppose that wherever such slaughter takes place,\r\nthere must necessarily be a deity to whom the carnage is believed by\r\nthe slayers to be acceptable. Thus their preconceived ideas may\r\nunconsciously colour and warp their descriptions of savage rites.\r\n\r\nThe same custom of killing the representative of a god, of which\r\nstrong traces appear in the Khond sacrifices, may perhaps be\r\ndetected in some of the other human sacrifices described above. Thus\r\nthe ashes of the slaughtered Marimo were scattered over the fields;\r\nthe blood of the Brahman lad was put on the crop and field; the\r\nflesh of the slain Naga was stowed in the corn-bin; and the blood of\r\nthe Sioux girl was allowed to trickle on the seed. Again, the\r\nidentification of the victim with the corn, in other words, the view\r\nthat he is an embodiment or spirit of the corn, is brought out in\r\nthe pains which seem to be taken to secure a physical correspondence\r\nbetween him and the natural object which he embodies or represents.\r\nThus the Mexicans killed young victims for the young corn and old\r\nones for the ripe corn; the Marimos sacrifice, as "seed," a short,\r\nfat man, the shortness of his stature corresponding to that of the\r\nyoung corn, his fatness to the condition which it is desired that\r\nthe crops may attain; and the Pawnees fattened their victims\r\nprobably with the same view. Again, the identification of the victim\r\nwith the corn comes out in the African custom of killing him with\r\nspades and hoes, and the Mexican custom of grinding him, like corn,\r\nbetween two stones.\r\n\r\nOne more point in these savage customs deserves to be noted. The\r\nPawnee chief devoured the heart of the Sioux girl, and the Marimos\r\nand Gonds ate the victim\'s flesh. If, as we suppose, the victim was\r\nregarded as divine, it follows that in eating his flesh his\r\nworshippers believed themselves to be partaking of the body of their\r\ngod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The Corn-spirit slain in his Human Representatives\r\n\r\nTHE BARBAROUS rites just described offer analogies to the harvest\r\ncustoms of Europe. Thus the fertilising virtue ascribed to the\r\ncorn-spirit is shown equally in the savage custom of mixing the\r\nvictim\'s blood or ashes with the seed-corn and the European custom\r\nof mixing the grain from the last sheaf with the young corn in\r\nspring. Again, the identification of the person with the corn\r\nappears alike in the savage custom of adapting the age and stature\r\nof the victim to the age and stature, whether actual or expected, of\r\nthe crop; in the Scotch and Styrian rules that when the corn-spirit\r\nis conceived as the Maiden the last corn shall be cut by a young\r\nmaiden, but when it is conceived as the Corn-mother it shall be cut\r\nby an old woman; in the warning given to old women in Lorraine to\r\nsave themselves when the Old Woman is being killed, that is, when\r\nthe last corn is being threshed; and in the Tyrolese expectation\r\nthat if the man who gives the last stroke at threshing is tall, the\r\nnext year\'s corn will be tall also. Further, the same identification\r\nis implied in the savage custom of killing the representative of the\r\ncorn-spirit with hoes or spades or by grinding him between stones,\r\nand in the European custom of pretending to kill him with the scythe\r\nor the flail. Once more the Khond custom of pouring water on the\r\nburied flesh of the victim is parallel to the European customs of\r\npouring water on the personal representative of the corn-spirit or\r\nplunging him into a stream. Both the Khond and the European customs\r\nare rain-charms.\r\n\r\nTo return now to the Lityerses story. It has been shown that in rude\r\nsociety human beings have been commonly killed to promote the growth\r\nof the crops. There is therefore no improbability in the supposition\r\nthat they may once have been killed for a like purpose in Phrygia\r\nand Europe; and when Phrygian legend and European folk-custom,\r\nclosely agreeing with each other, point to the conclusion that men\r\nwere so slain, we are bound, provisionally at least, to accept the\r\nconclusion. Further, both the Lityerses story and European\r\nharvest-customs agree in indicating that the victim was put to death\r\nas a representative of the corn-spirit, and this indication is in\r\nharmony with the view which some savages appear to take of the\r\nvictim slain to make the crops flourish. On the whole, then, we may\r\nfairly suppose that both in Phrygia and in Europe the representative\r\nof the corn-spirit was annually killed upon the harvest-field.\r\nGrounds have been already shown for believing that similarly in\r\nEurope the representative of the tree-spirit was annually slain. The\r\nproofs of these two remarkable and closely analogous customs are\r\nentirely independent of each other. Their coincidence seems to\r\nfurnish fresh presumption in favour of both.\r\n\r\nTo the question, How was the representative of the corn-spirit\r\nchosen? one answer has been already given. Both the Lityerses story\r\nand European folk-custom show that passing strangers were regarded\r\nas manifestations of the corn-spirit escaping from the cut or\r\nthreshed corn, and as such were seized and slain. But this is not\r\nthe only answer which the evidence suggests. According to the\r\nPhrygian legend the victims of Lityerses were not simply passing\r\nstrangers, but persons whom he had vanquished in a reaping contest\r\nand afterwards wrapt up in corn-sheaves and beheaded. This suggests\r\nthat the representative of the corn-spirit may have been selected by\r\nmeans of a competition on the harvest-field, in which the vanquished\r\ncompetitor was compelled to accept the fatal honour. The supposition\r\nis countenanced by European harvest-customs. We have seen that in\r\nEurope there is sometimes a contest amongst the reapers to avoid\r\nbeing last, and that the person who is vanquished in this\r\ncompetition, that is, who cuts the last corn, is often roughly\r\nhandled. It is true we have not found that a pretence is made of\r\nkilling him; but on the other hand we have found that a pretence is\r\nmade of killing the man who gives the last stroke at threshing, that\r\nis, who is vanquished in the threshing contest. Now, since it is in\r\nthe character of representative of the corn-spirit that the thresher\r\nof the last corn is slain in mimicry, and since the same\r\nrepresentative character attaches (as we have seen) to the cutter\r\nand binder as well as to the thresher of the last corn, and since\r\nthe same repugnance is evinced by harvesters to be last in any one\r\nof these labours, we may conjecture that a pretence has been\r\ncommonly made of killing the reaper and binder as well as the\r\nthresher of the last corn, and that in ancient times this killing\r\nwas actually carried out. This conjecture is corroborated by the\r\ncommon superstition that whoever cuts the last corn must die soon.\r\nSometimes it is thought that the person who binds the last sheaf on\r\nthe field will die in the course of next year. The reason for fixing\r\non the reaper, binder, or thresher of the last corn as the\r\nrepresentative of the corn-spirit may be this. The corn-spirit is\r\nsupposed to lurk as long as he can in the corn, retreating before\r\nthe reapers, the binders, and the threshers at their work. But when\r\nhe is forcibly expelled from his refuge in the last corn cut or the\r\nlast sheaf bound or the last grain threshed, he necessarily assumes\r\nsome other form than that of the corn-stalks, which had hitherto\r\nbeen his garment or body. And what form can the expelled corn-spirit\r\nassume more naturally than that of the person who stands nearest to\r\nthe corn from which he (the corn-spirit) has just been expelled? But\r\nthe person in question is necessarily the reaper, binder, or\r\nthresher of the last corn. He or she, therefore, is seized and\r\ntreated as the corn-spirit himself.\r\n\r\nThus the person who was killed on the harvest-field as the\r\nrepresentative of the corn-spirit may have been either a passing\r\nstranger or the harvester who was last at reaping, binding, or\r\nthreshing. But there is a third possibility, to which ancient legend\r\nand modern folk-custom alike point. Lityerses not only put strangers\r\nto death; he was himself slain, and apparently in the same way as he\r\nhad slain others, namely, by being wrapt in a corn-sheaf, beheaded,\r\nand cast into the river; and it is implied that this happened to\r\nLityerses on his own land. Similarly in modern harvest-customs the\r\npretence of killing appears to be carried out quite as often on the\r\nperson of the master (farmer or squire) as on that of strangers. Now\r\nwhen we remember that Lityerses was said to have been a son of the\r\nKing of Phrygia, and that in one account he is himself called a\r\nking, and when we combine with this the tradition that he was put to\r\ndeath, apparently as a representative of the corn-spirit, we are led\r\nto conjecture that we have here another trace of the custom of\r\nannually slaying one of those divine or priestly kings who are known\r\nto have held ghostly sway in many parts of Western Asia and\r\nparticularly in Phrygia. The custom appears, as we have seen, to\r\nhave been so far modified in places that the king\'s son was slain in\r\nthe king\'s stead. Of the custom thus modified the story of Lityerses\r\nwould be, in one version at least, a reminiscence.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the relation of the Phrygian Lityerses to the\r\nPhrygian Attis, it may be remembered that at Pessinus--the seat of a\r\npriestly kingship--the high-priest appears to have been annually\r\nslain in the character of Attis, a god of vegetation, and that Attis\r\nwas described by an ancient authority as "a reaped ear of corn."\r\nThus Attis, as an embodiment of the corn-spirit, annually slain in\r\nthe person of his representative, might be thought to be ultimately\r\nidentical with Lityerses, the latter being simply the rustic\r\nprototype out of which the state religion of Attis was developed. It\r\nmay have been so; but, on the other hand, the analogy of European\r\nfolk-custom warns us that amongst the same people two distinct\r\ndeities of vegetation may have their separate personal\r\nrepresentatives, both of whom are slain in the character of gods at\r\ndifferent times of the year. For in Europe, as we have seen, it\r\nappears that one man was commonly slain in the character of the\r\ntree-spirit in spring, and another in the character of the\r\ncorn-spirit in autumn. It may have been so in Phrygia also. Attis\r\nwas especially a tree-god, and his connexion with corn may have been\r\nonly such an extension of the power of a tree-spirit as is indicated\r\nin customs like the Harvest-May. Again, the representative of Attis\r\nappears to have been slain in spring; whereas Lityerses must have\r\nbeen slain in summer or autumn, according to the time of the harvest\r\nin Phrygia. On the whole, then, while we are not justified in\r\nregarding Lityerses as the prototype of Attis, the two may be\r\nregarded as parallel products of the same religious idea, and may\r\nhave stood to each other as in Europe the Old Man of harvest stands\r\nto the Wild Man, the Leaf Man, and so forth, of spring. Both were\r\nspirits or deities of vegetation, and the personal representatives\r\nof both were annually slain. But whereas the Attis worship became\r\nelevated into the dignity of a state religion and spread to Italy,\r\nthe rites of Lityerses seem never to have passed the limits of their\r\nnative Phrygia, and always retained their character of rustic\r\nceremonies performed by peasants on the harvest-field. At most a few\r\nvillages may have clubbed together, as amongst the Khonds, to\r\nprocure a human victim to be slain as representative of the\r\ncorn-spirit for their common benefit. Such victims may have been\r\ndrawn from the families of priestly kings or kinglets, which would\r\naccount for the legendary character of Lityerses as the son of a\r\nPhrygian king or as himself a king. When villages did not so club\r\ntogether, each village or farm may have procured its own\r\nrepresentative of the corn-spirit by dooming to death either a\r\npassing stranger or the harvester who cut, bound, or threshed the\r\nlast sheaf. Perhaps in the olden time the practice of head-hunting\r\nas a means of promoting the growth of the corn may have been as\r\ncommon among the rude inhabitants of Europe and Western Asia as it\r\nstill is, or was till lately, among the primitive agricultural\r\ntribes of Assam, Burma, the Philippine Islands, and the Indian\r\nArchipelago. It is hardly necessary to add that in Phrygia, as in\r\nEurope, the old barbarous custom of killing a man on the\r\nharvest-field or the threshing-floor had doubtless passed into a\r\nmere pretence long before the classical era, and was probably\r\nregarded by the reapers and threshers themselves as no more than a\r\nrough jest which the license of a harvest-home permitted them to\r\nplay off on a passing stranger, a comrade, or even on their master\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt on the Lityerses song at length because it affords so\r\nmany points of comparison with European and savage folk-custom. The\r\nother harvest songs of Western Asia and Egypt, to which attention\r\nhas been called above, may now be dismissed much more briefly. The\r\nsimilarity of the Bithynian Bormus to the Phrygian Lityerses helps\r\nto bear out the interpretation which has been given of the latter.\r\nBormus, whose death or rather disappearance was annually mourned by\r\nthe reapers in a plaintive song, was, like Lityerses, a king\'s son\r\nor at least the son of a wealthy and distinguished man. The reapers\r\nwhom he watched were at work on his own fields, and he disappeared\r\nin going to fetch water for them; according to one version of the\r\nstory he was carried off by the nymphs, doubtless the nymphs of the\r\nspring or pool or river whither he went to draw water. Viewed in the\r\nlight of the Lityerses story and of European folk-custom, this\r\ndisappearance of Bormus may be a reminiscence of the custom of\r\nbinding the farmer himself in a corn-sheaf and throwing him into the\r\nwater. The mournful strain which the reapers sang was probably a\r\nlamentation over the death of the corn-spirit, slain either in the\r\ncut corn or in the person of a human representative; and the call\r\nwhich they addressed to him may have been a prayer that he might\r\nreturn in fresh vigour next year.\r\n\r\nThe Phoenician Linus song was sung at the vintage, at least in the\r\nwest of Asia Minor, as we learn from Homer; and this, combined with\r\nthe legend of Syleus, suggests that in ancient times passing\r\nstrangers were handled by vintagers and vine-diggers in much the\r\nsame way as they are said to have been handled by the reaper\r\nLityerses. The Lydian Syleus, so ran the legend, compelled\r\npassers-by to dig for him in his vineyard, till Hercules came and\r\nkilled him and dug up his vines by the roots. This seems to be the\r\noutline of a legend like that of Lityerses; but neither ancient\r\nwriters nor modern folk-custom enable us to fill in the details.\r\nBut, further, the Linus song was probably sung also by Phoenician\r\nreapers, for Herodotus compares it to the Maneros song, which, as we\r\nhave seen, was a lament raised by Egyptian reapers over the cut\r\ncorn. Further, Linus was identified with Adonis, and Adonis has some\r\nclaims to be regarded as especially a corn-deity. Thus the Linus\r\nlament, as sung at harvest, would be identical with the Adonis\r\nlament; each would be the lamentation raised by reapers over the\r\ndead spirit of the corn. But whereas Adonis, like Attis, grew into a\r\nstately figure of mythology, adored and mourned in splendid cities\r\nfar beyond the limits of his Phoenician home, Linus appears to have\r\nremained a simple ditty sung by reapers and vintagers among the\r\ncorn-sheaves and the vines. The analogy of Lityerses and of\r\nfolk-custom, both European and savage, suggests that in Phoenicia\r\nthe slain corn-spirit--the dead Adonis--may formerly have been\r\nrepresented by a human victim; and this suggestion is possibly\r\nsupported by the Harran legend that Tammuz (Adonis) was slain by his\r\ncruel lord, who ground his bones in a mill and scattered them to the\r\nwind. For in Mexico, as we have seen, the human victim at harvest\r\nwas crushed between two stones; and both in Africa and India the\r\nashes or other remains of the victim were scattered over the fields.\r\nBut the Harran legend may be only a mythical way of expressing the\r\ngrinding of corn in the mill and the scattering of the seed. It\r\nseems worth suggesting that the mock king who was annually killed at\r\nthe Babylonian festival of the Sacaea on the sixteenth day of the\r\nmonth Lous may have represented Tammuz himself. For the historian\r\nBerosus, who records the festival and its date, probably used the\r\nMacedonian calendar, since he dedicated his history to Antiochus\r\nSoter; and in his day the Macedonian month Lous appears to have\r\ncorresponded to the Babylonian month Tammuz. If this conjecture is\r\nright, the view that the mock king at the Sacaea was slain in the\r\ncharacter of a god would be established.\r\n\r\nThere is a good deal more evidence that in Egypt the slain\r\ncorn-spirit--the dead Osiris--was represented by a human victim,\r\nwhom the reapers slew on the harvest-field, mourning his death in a\r\ndirge, to which the Greeks, through a verbal misunderstanding, gave\r\nthe name of Maneros. For the legend of Busiris seems to preserve a\r\nreminiscence of human sacrifices once offered by the Egyptians in\r\nconnexion with the worship of Osiris. Busiris was said to have been\r\nan Egyptian king who sacrificed all strangers on the altar of Zeus.\r\nThe origin of the custom was traced to a dearth which afflicted the\r\nland of Egypt for nine years. A Cyprian seer informed Busiris that\r\nthe dearth would cease if a man were annually sacrificed to Zeus. So\r\nBusiris instituted the sacrifice. But when Hercules came to Egypt,\r\nand was being dragged to the altar to be sacrificed, he burst his\r\nbonds and slew Busiris and his son. Here then is a legend that in\r\nEgypt a human victim was annually sacrificed to prevent the failure\r\nof the crops, and a belief is implied that an omission of the\r\nsacrifice would have entailed a recurrence of that infertility which\r\nit was the object of the sacrifice to prevent. So the Pawnees, as we\r\nhave seen, believed that an omission of the human sacrifice at\r\nplanting would have been followed by a total failure of their crops.\r\nThe name Busiris was in reality the name of a city, _pe-Asar,_ "the\r\nhouse of Osiris," the city being so called because it contained the\r\ngrave of Osiris. Indeed some high modern authorities believe that\r\nBusiris was the original home of Osiris, from which his worship\r\nspread to other parts of Egypt. The human sacrifice were said to\r\nhave been offered at his grave, and the victims were red-haired men,\r\nwhose ashes were scattered abroad by means of winnowing-fans. This\r\ntradition of human sacrifices offered at the tomb of Osiris is\r\nconfirmed by the evidence of the monuments.\r\n\r\nIn the light of the foregoing discussion the Egyptian tradition of\r\nBusiris admits of a consistent and fairly probable explanation.\r\nOsiris, the corn-spirit, was annually represented at harvest by a\r\nstranger, whose red hair made him a suitable representative of the\r\nripe corn. This man, in his representative character, was slain on\r\nthe harvest-field, and mourned by the reapers, who prayed at the\r\nsame time that the corn-spirit might revive and return\r\n(_m\xe2\xe2-ne-rha,_ Maneros) with renewed vigour in the following year.\r\nFinally, the victim, or some part of him, was burned, and the ashes\r\nscattered by winnowing-fans over the fields to fertilise them. Here\r\nthe choice of the victim on the ground of his resemblance to the\r\ncorn which he was to represent agrees with the Mexican and African\r\ncustoms already described. Similarly the woman who died in the\r\ncharacter of the Corn-mother at the Mexican midsummer sacrifice had\r\nher face painted red and yellow in token of the colours of the corn,\r\nand she wore a pasteboard mitre surmounted by waving plumes in\r\nimitation of the tassel of the maize. On the other hand, at the\r\nfestival of the Goddess of the White Maize the Mexicans sacrificed\r\nlepers. The Romans sacrificed red-haired puppies in spring to avert\r\nthe supposed blighting influence of the Dog-star, believing that the\r\ncrops would thus grow ripe and ruddy. The heathen of Harran offered\r\nto the sun, moon, and planets human victims who were chosen on the\r\nground of their supposed resemblance to the heavenly bodies to which\r\nthey were sacrificed; for example, the priests, clothed in red and\r\nsmeared with blood, offered a red-haired, red-cheeked man to "the\r\nred planet Mars" in a temple which was painted red and draped with\r\nred hangings. These and the like cases of assimilating the victim to\r\nthe god, or to the natural phenomenon which he represents, are based\r\nultimately on the principle of homoeopathic or imitative magic, the\r\nnotion being that the object aimed at will be most readily attained\r\nby means of a sacrifice which resembles the effect that it is\r\ndesigned to bring about.\r\n\r\nThe story that the fragments of Osiris\'s body were scattered up and\r\ndown the land, and buried by Isis on the spots where they lay, may\r\nvery well be a reminiscence of a custom, like that observed by the\r\nKhonds, of dividing the human victim in pieces and burying the\r\npieces, often at intervals of many miles from each other, in the\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nThus, if I am right, the key to the mysteries of Osiris is furnished\r\nby the melancholy cry of the Egyptian reapers, which down to Roman\r\ntimes could be heard year after year sounding across the fields,\r\nannouncing the death of the corn-spirit, the rustic prototype of\r\nOsiris. Similar cries, as we have seen, were also heard on all the\r\nharvest-fields of Western Asia. By the ancients they are spoken of\r\nas songs; but to judge from the analysis of the names Linus and\r\nManeros, they probably consisted only of a few words uttered in a\r\nprolonged musical note which could be heard at a great distance.\r\nSuch sonorous and long-drawn cries, raised by a number of strong\r\nvoices in concert, must have had a striking effect, and could hardly\r\nfail to arrest the attention of any wayfarer who happened to be\r\nwithin hearing. The sounds, repeated again and again, could probably\r\nbe distinguished with tolerable ease even at a distance; but to a\r\nGreek traveller in Asia or Egypt the foreign words would commonly\r\nconvey no meaning, and he might take them, not unnaturally, for the\r\nname of some one (Maneros, Linus, Lityerses, Bormus) upon whom the\r\nreapers were calling. And if his journey led him through more\r\ncountries than one, as Bithynia and Phrygia, or Phoenicia and Egypt,\r\nwhile the corn was being reaped, he would have an opportunity of\r\ncomparing the various harvest cries of the different peoples. Thus\r\nwe can readily understand why these harvest cries were so often\r\nnoted and compared with each other by the Greeks. Whereas, if they\r\nhad been regular songs, they could not have been heard at such\r\ndistances, and therefore could not have attracted the attention of\r\nso many travellers; and, moreover, even if the wayfarer were within\r\nhearing of them, he could not so easily have picked out the words.\r\n\r\nDown to recent times Devonshire reapers uttered cries of the same\r\nsort, and performed on the field a ceremony exactly analogous to\r\nthat in which, if I am not mistaken, the rites of Osiris originated.\r\nThe cry and the ceremony are thus described by an observer who wrote\r\nin the first half of the nineteenth century. "After the wheat is all\r\ncut, on most farms in the north of Devon, the harvest people have a\r\ncustom of \'crying the neck.\' I believe that this practice is seldom\r\nomitted on any large farm in that part of the country. It is done in\r\nthis way. An old man, or some one else well acquainted with the\r\nceremonies used on the occasion (when the labourers are reaping the\r\nlast field of wheat), goes round to the shocks and sheaves, and\r\npicks out a little bundle of all the best ears he can find; this\r\nbundle he ties up very neat and trim, and plats and arranges the\r\nstraws very tastefully. This is called \'the neck\' of wheat, or\r\nwheaten-ears. After the field is cut out, and the pitcher once more\r\ncirculated, the reapers, binders, and the women stand round in a\r\ncircle. The person with \'the neck\' stands in the centre, grasping it\r\nwith both hands. He first stoops and holds it near the ground, and\r\nall the men forming the ring take off their hats, stooping and\r\nholding them with both hands towards the ground. They then all begin\r\nat once in a very prolonged and harmonious tone to cry \'The neck!\'\r\nat the same time slowly raising themselves upright, and elevating\r\ntheir arms and hats above their heads; the person with \'the neck\'\r\nalso raising it on high. This is done three times. They then change\r\ntheir cry to \'Wee yen!\'--\'Way yen!\'--which they sound in the same\r\nprolonged and slow manner as before, with singular harmony and\r\neffect, three times. This last cry is accompanied by the same\r\nmovements of the body and arms as in crying \'the neck.\' . . . After\r\nhaving thus repeated \'the neck\' three times, and \'wee yen,\' or \'way\r\nyen\' as often, they all burst out into a kind of loud and joyous\r\nlaugh, flinging up their hats and caps into the air, capering about\r\nand perhaps kissing the girls. One of them then gets \'the neck\' and\r\nruns as hard as he can down to the farmhouse, where the dairymaid,\r\nor one of the young female domestics, stands at the door prepared\r\nwith a pail of water. If he who holds \'the neck\' can manage to get\r\ninto the house, in any way unseen, or openly, by any other way than\r\nthe door at which the girl stands with the pail of water, then he\r\nmay lawfully kiss her; but, if otherwise, he is regularly soused\r\nwith the contents of the bucket. On a fine still autumn evening the\r\n\'crying of the neck\' has a wonderful effect at a distance, far finer\r\nthan that of the Turkish muezzin, which Lord Byron eulogises so\r\nmuch, and which he says is preferable to all the bells of\r\nChristendom. I have once or twice heard upwards of twenty men cry\r\nit, and sometimes joined by an equal number of female voices. About\r\nthree years back, on some high grounds, where our people were\r\nharvesting, I heard six or seven \'necks\' cried in one night,\r\nalthough I know that some of them were four miles off. They are\r\nheard through the quiet evening air at a considerable distance\r\nsometimes." Again, Mrs. Bray tells how, travelling in Devonshire,\r\n"she saw a party of reapers standing in a circle on a rising ground,\r\nholding their sickles aloft. One in the middle held up some ears of\r\ncorn tied together with flowers, and the party shouted three times\r\n(what she writes as) \'Arnack, arnack, arnack, we _haven,_ we\r\n_haven,_ we _haven._\' They went home, accompanied by women and\r\nchildren carrying boughs of flowers, shouting and singing. The\r\nmanservant who attended Mrs. Bray said \'it was only the people\r\nmaking their games, as they always did, _to the spirit of\r\nharvest._\'" Here, as Miss Burne remarks, "\'arnack, we haven!\' is\r\nobviously in the Devon dialect, \'a neck (or nack)! we have un!\'"\r\n\r\nAnother account of this old custom, written at Truro in 1839, runs\r\nthus: "Now, when all the corn was cut at Heligan, the farming men\r\nand maidens come in front of the house, and bring with them a small\r\nsheaf of corn, the last that has been cut, and this is adorned with\r\nribbons and flowers, and one part is tied quite tight, so as to look\r\nlike a neck. Then they cry out \'Our (my) side, my side,\' as loud as\r\nthey can; then the dairymaid gives the neck to the head farming-man.\r\nHe takes it, and says, very loudly three times, \'I have him, I have\r\nhim, I have him.\' Then another farming-man shouts very loudly, \'What\r\nhave ye? what have ye? what have ye?\' Then the first says, \'A neck,\r\na neck, a neck.\' And when he has said this, all the people make a\r\nvery great shouting. This they do three times, and after one famous\r\nshout go away and eat supper, and dance, and sing songs." According\r\nto another account, "all went out to the field when the last corn\r\nwas cut, the \'neck\' was tied with ribbons and plaited, and they\r\ndanced round it, and carried it to the great kitchen, where\r\nby-and-by the supper was. The words were as given in the previous\r\naccount, and \'Hip, hip, hack, heck, I have \'ee, I have \'ee, I have\r\n\'ee.\' It was hung up in the hall." Another account relates that one\r\nof the men rushed from the field with the last sheaf, while the rest\r\npursued him with vessels of water, which they tried to throw over\r\nthe sheaf before it could be brought into the barn.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing customs a particular bunch of ears, generally the\r\nlast left standing, is conceived as the neck of the corn-spirit, who\r\nis consequently beheaded when the bunch is cut down. Similarly in\r\nShropshire the name "neck," or "the gander\'s neck," used to be\r\ncommonly given to the last handful of ears left standing in the\r\nmiddle of the field when all the rest of the corn was cut. It was\r\nplaited together, and the reapers, standing ten or twenty paces off,\r\nthrew their sickles at it. Whoever cut it through was said to have\r\ncut off the gander\'s neck. The "neck" was taken to the farmer\'s\r\nwife, who was supposed to keep it in the house for good luck till\r\nthe next harvest came round. Near Tr\xe8ves, the man who reaps the last\r\nstanding corn "cuts the goat\'s neck off." At Faslane, on the\r\nGareloch (Dumbartonshire), the last handful of standing corn was\r\nsometimes called the "head." At Aurich, in East Friesland, the man\r\nwho reaps the last corn "cuts the hare\'s tail off." In mowing down\r\nthe last corner of a field French reapers sometimes call out, "We\r\nhave the cat by the tail." In Bresse (Bourgogne) the last sheaf\r\nrepresented the fox. Beside it a score of ears were left standing to\r\nform the tail, and each reaper, going back some paces, threw his\r\nsickle at it. He who succeeded in severing it "cut off the fox\'s\r\ntail," and a cry of "_You cou cou!_" was raised in his honour. These\r\nexamples leave no room to doubt the meaning of the Devonshire and\r\nCornish expression "the neck," as applied to the last sheaf. The\r\ncorn-spirit is conceived in human or animal form, and the last\r\nstanding corn is part of its body--its neck, its head, or its tail.\r\nSometimes, as we have seen, the last corn is regarded as the\r\nnavel-string. Lastly, the Devonshire custom of drenching with water\r\nthe person who brings in "the neck" is a raincharm, such as we have\r\nhad many examples of. Its parallel in the mysteries of Osiris was\r\nthe custom of pouring water on the image of Osiris or on the person\r\nwho represented him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIII. The Corn-Spirit as an Animal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Animal Embodiments of the Corn-spirit\r\n\r\nIN SOME of the examples which I have cited to establish the meaning\r\nof the term "neck" as applied to the last sheaf, the corn-spirit\r\nappears in animal form as a gander, a goat, a hare, a cat, and a\r\nfox. This introduces us to a new aspect of the corn-spirit, which we\r\nmust now examine. By doing so we shall not only have fresh examples\r\nof killing the god, but may hope also to clear up some points which\r\nremain obscure in the myths and worship of Adonis, Attis, Osiris,\r\nDionysus, Demeter, and Virbius.\r\n\r\nAmongst the many animals whose forms the corn-spirit is supposed to\r\ntake are the wolf, dog, hare, fox, cock, goose, quail, cat, goat,\r\ncow (ox, bull), pig, and horse. In one or other of these shapes the\r\ncorn-spirit is often believed to be present in the corn, and to be\r\ncaught or killed in the last sheaf. As the corn is being cut the\r\nanimal flees before the reapers, and if a reaper is taken ill on the\r\nfield, he is supposed to have stumbled unwittingly on the\r\ncorn-spirit, who has thus punished the profane intruder. It is said\r\n"the Rye-wolf has got hold of him," "the Harvest-goat has given him\r\na push." The person who cuts the last corn or binds the last sheaf\r\ngets the name of the animal, as the Rye-wolf, the Rye-sow, the\r\nOats-goat, and so forth, and retains the name sometimes for a year.\r\nAlso the animal is frequently represented by a puppet made out of\r\nthe last sheaf or of wood, flowers, and so on, which is carried home\r\namid rejoicings on the last harvest-waggon. Even where the last\r\nsheaf is not made up in animal shape, it is often called the\r\nRye-wolf, the Hare, Goat, and so forth. Generally each kind of crop\r\nis supposed to have its special animal, which is caught in the last\r\nsheaf, and called the Rye-wolf, the Barley-wolf, the Oats-wolf, the\r\nPea-wolf, or the Potato-wolf, according to the crop; but sometimes\r\nthe figure of the animal is only made up once for all at getting in\r\nthe last crop of the whole harvest. Sometimes the creature is\r\nbelieved to be killed by the last stroke of the sickle or scythe.\r\nBut oftener it is thought to live so long as there is corn still\r\nunthreshed, and to be caught in the last sheaf threshed. Hence the\r\nman who gives the last stroke with the flail is told that he has got\r\nthe Corn-sow, the Threshing-dog, or the like. When the threshing is\r\nfinished, a puppet is made in the form of the animal, and this is\r\ncarried by the thresher of the last sheaf to a neighbouring farm,\r\nwhere the threshing is still going on. This again shows that the\r\ncorn-spirit is believed to live wherever the corn is still being\r\nthreshed. Sometimes the thresher of the last sheaf himself\r\nrepresents the animal; and if the people of the next farm, who are\r\nstill threshing, catch him, they treat him like the animal he\r\nrepresents, by shutting him up in the pig-sty, calling him with the\r\ncries commonly addressed to pigs, and so forth. These general\r\nstatements will now be illustrated by examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Corn-spirit as a Wolf or a Dog\r\n\r\nWE begin with the corn-spirit conceived as a wolf or a dog. This\r\nconception is common in France, Germany, and Slavonic countries.\r\nThus, when the wind sets the corn in wave-like motion the peasants\r\noften say, "The Wolf is going over, or through, the corn," "the\r\nRye-wolf is rushing over the field," "the Wolf is in the corn," "the\r\nmad Dog is in the corn," "the big Dog is there." When children wish\r\nto go into the corn-fields to pluck ears or gather the blue\r\ncorn-flowers, they are warned not to do so, for "the big Dog sits in\r\nthe corn," or "the Wolf sits in the corn, and will tear you in\r\npieces," "the Wolf will eat you." The wolf against whom the children\r\nare warned is not a common wolf, for he is often spoken of as the\r\nCorn-wolf, Rye-wolf, or the like; thus they say, "The Rye-wolf will\r\ncome and eat you up, children," "the Rye-wolf will carry you off,"\r\nand so forth. Still he has all the outward appearance of a wolf. For\r\nin the neighbourhood of Feilenhof (East Prussia), when a wolf was\r\nseen running through a field, the peasants used to watch whether he\r\ncarried his tail in the air or dragged it on the ground. If he\r\ndragged it on the ground, they went after him, and thanked him for\r\nbringing them a blessing, and even set tit-bits before him. But if\r\nhe carried his tail high, they cursed him and tried to kill him.\r\nHere the wolf is the corn-spirit whose fertilising power is in his\r\ntail.\r\n\r\nBoth dog and wolf appear as embodiments of the corn-spirit in\r\nharvest-customs. Thus in some parts of Silesia the person who cuts\r\nor binds the last sheaf is called the Wheat-dog or the Peas-pug. But\r\nit is in the harvest-customs of the north-east of France that the\r\nidea of the Corn-dog comes out most clearly. Thus when a harvester,\r\nthrough sickness, weariness, or laziness, cannot or will not keep up\r\nwith the reaper in front of him, they say, "The White Dog passed\r\nnear him," "he has the White Bitch," or "the White Bitch has bitten\r\nhim." In the Vosges the Harvest-May is called the "Dog of the\r\nharvest," and the person who cuts the last handful of hay or wheat\r\nis said to "kill the Dog." About Lons-le-Saulnier, in the Jura, the\r\nlast sheaf is called the Bitch. In the neighbourhood of Verdun the\r\nregular expression for finishing the reaping is, "They are going to\r\nkill the Dog"; and at Epinal they say, according to the crop, "We\r\nwill kill the Wheat-dog, or the Rye-dog, or the Potato-dog." In\r\nLorraine it is said of the man who cuts the last corn, "He is\r\nkilling the Dog of the harvest." At Dux, in the Tyrol, the man who\r\ngives the last stroke at threshing is said to "strike down the Dog";\r\nand at Ahnebergen, near Stade, he is called, according to the crop,\r\nCorn-pug, Rye-pug, Wheat-pug.\r\n\r\nSo with the wolf. In Silesia, when the reapers gather round the last\r\npatch of standing corn to reap it they are said to be about "to\r\ncatch the Wolf." In various parts of Mecklenburg, where the belief\r\nin the Corn-wolf is particularly prevalent, every one fears to cut\r\nthe last corn, because they say that the Wolf is sitting in it;\r\nhence every reaper exerts himself to the utmost in order not to be\r\nthe last, and every woman similarly fears to bind the last sheaf\r\nbecause "the Wolf is in it." So both among the reapers and the\r\nbinders there is a competition not to be the last to finish. And in\r\nGermany generally it appears to be a common saying that "the Wolf\r\nsits in the last sheaf." In some places they call out to the reaper,\r\n"Beware of the Wolf"; or they say, "He is chasing the Wolf out of\r\nthe corn." In Mecklenburg the last bunch of standing corn is itself\r\ncommonly called the Wolf, and the man who reaps it "has the Wolf,"\r\nthe animal being described as the Rye-wolf, the Wheat-wolf, the\r\nBarley-wolf, and so on according to the particular crop. The reaper\r\nof the last corn is himself called Wolf or the Rye-wolf, if the crop\r\nis rye, and in many parts of Mecklenburg he has to support the\r\ncharacter by pretending to bite the other harvesters or by howling\r\nlike a wolf. The last sheaf of corn is also called the Wolf or the\r\nRye-wolf or the Oats-wolf according to the crop, and of the woman\r\nwho binds it they say, "The Wolf is biting her," "She has the Wolf,"\r\n"She must fetch the Wolf" (out of the corn). Moreover, she herself\r\nis called Wolf; they cry out to her, "Thou art the Wolf," and she\r\nhas to bear the name for a whole year; sometimes, according to the\r\ncrop, she is called the Rye-wolf or the Potato-wolf. In the island\r\nof R\xfcgen not only is the woman who binds the last sheaf called Wolf,\r\nbut when she comes home she bites the lady of the house and the\r\nstewardess, for which she receives a large piece of meat. Yet nobody\r\nlikes to be the Wolf. The same woman may be Rye-wolf, Wheat-wolf,\r\nand Oats-wolf, if she happens to bind the last sheaf of rye, wheat,\r\nand oats. At Buir, in the district of Cologne, it was formerly the\r\ncustom to give to the last sheaf the shape of a wolf. It was kept in\r\nthe barn till all the corn was threshed. Then it was brought to the\r\nfarmer and he had to sprinkle it with beer or brandy. At\r\nBrunshaupten in Mecklenburg the young woman who bound the last sheaf\r\nof wheat used to take a handful of stalks out of it and make "the\r\nWheat-wolf" with them; it was the figure of a wolf about two feet\r\nlong and half a foot high, the legs of the animal being represented\r\nby stiff stalks and its tail and mane by wheat-ears. This Wheat-wolf\r\nshe carried back at the head of the harvesters to the village, where\r\nit was set up on a high place in the parlour of the farm and\r\nremained there for a long time. In many places the sheaf called the\r\nWolf is made up in human form and dressed in clothes. This indicates\r\na confusion of ideas between the corn-spirit conceived in human and\r\nin animal form. Generally the Wolf is brought home on the last\r\nwaggon with joyful cries. Hence the last waggon-load itself receives\r\nthe name of the Wolf.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Wolf is supposed to hide himself amongst the cut corn in\r\nthe granary, until he is driven out of the last bundle by the\r\nstrokes of the flail. Hence at Wanzleben, near Magdeburg, after the\r\nthreshing the peasants go in procession, leading by a chain a man\r\nwho is enveloped in the threshed-out straw and is called the Wolf.\r\nHe represents the corn-spirit who has been caught escaping from the\r\nthreshed corn. In the district of Treves it is believed that the\r\nCorn-wolf is killed at threshing. The men thresh the last sheaf till\r\nit is reduced to chopped straw. In this way they think that the\r\nCorn-wolf, who was lurking in the last sheaf, has been certainly\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nIn France also the Corn-wolf appears at harvest. Thus they call out\r\nto the reaper of the last corn, "You will catch the Wolf." Near\r\nChamb\xe9ry they form a ring round the last standing corn, and cry,\r\n"The Wolf is in there." In Finisterre, when the reaping draws near\r\nan end, the harvesters cry, "There is the Wolf; we will catch him."\r\nEach takes a swath to reap, and he who finishes first calls out,\r\n"I\'ve caught the Wolf." In Guyenne, when the last corn has been\r\nreaped, they lead a wether all round the field. It is called "the\r\nWolf of the field." Its horns are decked with a wreath of flowers\r\nand corn-ears, and its neck and body are also encircled with\r\ngarlands and ribbons. All the reapers march, singing, behind it.\r\nThen it is killed on the field. In this part of France the last\r\nsheaf is called the _coujoulage,_ which, in the patois, means a\r\nwether. Hence the killing of the wether represents the death of the\r\ncorn-spirit, considered as present in the last sheaf; but two\r\ndifferent conceptions of the corn-spirit--as a wolf and as a\r\nwether--are mixed up together.\r\n\r\nSometimes it appears to be thought that the Wolf, caught in the last\r\ncorn, lives during the winter in the farmhouse, ready to renew his\r\nactivity as corn-spirit in the spring. Hence at midwinter, when the\r\nlengthening days begin to herald the approach of spring, the Wolf\r\nmakes his appearance once more. In Poland a man, with a wolf\'s skin\r\nthrown over his head, is led about at Christmas; or a stuffed wolf\r\nis carried about by persons who collect money. There are facts which\r\npoint to an old custom of leading about a man enveloped in leaves\r\nand called the Wolf, while his conductors collected money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The Corn-spirit as a Cock\r\n\r\nANOTHER form which the corn-spirit often assumes is that of a cock.\r\nIn Austria children are warned against straying in the corn-fields,\r\nbecause the Corn-cock sits there, and will peck their eyes out. In\r\nNorth Germany they say that "the Cock sits in the last sheaf"; and\r\nat cutting the last corn the reapers cry, "Now we will chase out the\r\nCock." When it is cut they say, "We have caught the Cock." At\r\nBraller, in Transylvania, when the reapers come to the last patch of\r\ncorn, they cry, "Here we shall catch the Cock." At F\xfcrstenwalde,\r\nwhen the last sheaf is about to be bound, the master releases a\r\ncock, which he has brought in a basket, and lets it run over the\r\nfield. All the harvesters chase it till they catch it. Elsewhere the\r\nharvesters all try to seize the last corn cut; he who succeeds in\r\ngrasping it must crow, and is called Cock. Among the Wends it is or\r\nused to be customary for the farmer to hide a live cock under the\r\nlast sheaf as it lay on the field; and when the corn was being\r\ngathered up, the harvester who lighted upon this sheaf had a right\r\nto keep the cock, provided he could catch it. This formed the close\r\nof the harvest-festival and was known as "the Cock-catching," and\r\nthe beer which was served out to the reapers at this time went by\r\nthe name of "Cock-beer." The last sheaf is called Cock, Cock-sheaf,\r\nHarvest-cock, Harvest-hen, Autumn-hen. A distinction is made between\r\na Wheat-cock, Bean-cock, and so on, according to the crop. At\r\nW\xfcnschensuhl, in Th\xfcringen, the last sheaf is made into the shape of\r\na cock, and called the Harvest-cock. A figure of a cock, made of\r\nwood, pasteboard, ears of corn, or flowers, is borne in front of the\r\nharvest-waggon, especially in Westphalia, where the cock carries in\r\nhis beak fruits of the earth of all kinds. Sometimes the image of\r\nthe cock is fastened to the top of a May-tree on the last\r\nharvest-waggon. Elsewhere a live cock, or a figure of one, is\r\nattached to a harvest-crown and carried on a pole. In Galicia and\r\nelsewhere this live cock is fastened to the garland of corn-ears or\r\nflowers, which the leader of the women-reapers carries on her head\r\nas she marches in front of the harvest procession. In Silesia a live\r\ncock is presented to the master on a plate. The harvest-supper is\r\ncalled Harvest-cock, Stubble-cock, etc., and a chief dish at it, at\r\nleast in some places, is a cock. If a waggoner upsets a\r\nharvest-waggon, it is said that "he has spilt the Harvest-cock," and\r\nhe loses the cock, that is, the harvest-supper. The harvest-waggon,\r\nwith the figure of the cock on it, is driven round the farmhouse\r\nbefore it is taken to the barn. Then the cock is nailed over or at\r\nthe side of the house-door, or on the gable, and remains there till\r\nnext harvest. In East Friesland the person who gives the last stroke\r\nat threshing is called the Clucking-hen, and grain is strewed before\r\nhim as if he were a hen.\r\n\r\nAgain, the corn-spirit is killed in the form of a cock. In parts of\r\nGermany, Hungary, Poland, and Picardy the reapers place a live cock\r\nin the corn which is to be cut last, and chase it over the field, or\r\nbury it up to the neck in the ground; afterwards they strike off its\r\nhead with a sickle or scythe. In many parts of Westphalia, when the\r\nharvesters bring the wooden cock to the farmer, he gives them a live\r\ncock, which they kill with whips or sticks, or behead with an old\r\nsword, or throw into the barn to the girls, or give to the mistress\r\nto cook. It the Harvest-cock has not been spilt--that is, if no\r\nwaggon has been upset--the harvesters have the right to kill the\r\nfarmyard cock by throwing stones at it or beheading it. Where this\r\ncustom has fallen into disuse, it is still common for the farmer\'s\r\nwife to make cockie-leekie for the harvesters, and to show them the\r\nhead of the cock which has been killed for the soup. In the\r\nneighbourhood of Klausenburg, Transylvania, a cock is buried on the\r\nharvest-field in the earth, so that only its head appears. A young\r\nman then takes a scythe and cuts off the cock\'s head at a single\r\nsweep. If he fails to do this, he is called the Red Cock for a whole\r\nyear, and people fear that next year\'s crop will be bad. Near\r\nUdvarhely, in Transylvania, a live cock is bound up in the last\r\nsheaf and killed with a spit. It is then skinned. The flesh is\r\nthrown away, but the skin and feathers are kept till next year; and\r\nin spring the grain from the last sheaf is mixed with the feathers\r\nof the cock and scattered on the field which is to be tilled.\r\nNothing could set in a clearer light the identification of the cock\r\nwith the spirit of the corn. By being tied up in the last sheaf and\r\nkilled, the cock is identified with the corn, and its death with the\r\ncutting of the corn. By keeping its feathers till spring, then\r\nmixing them with the seed-corn taken from the very sheaf in which\r\nthe bird had been bound, and scattering the feathers together with\r\nthe seed over the field, the identity of the bird with the corn is\r\nagain emphasised, and its quickening and fertilising power, as an\r\nembodiment of the corn-spirit, is intimated in the plainest manner.\r\nThus the corn-spirit, in the form of a cock, is killed at harvest,\r\nbut rises to fresh life and activity in spring. Again, the\r\nequivalence of the cock to the corn is expressed, hardly less\r\nplainly, in the custom of burying the bird in the ground, and\r\ncutting off its head (like the ears of corn) with the scythe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The Corn-spirit as a Hare\r\n\r\nANOTHER common embodiment of the corn-spirit is the hare. In\r\nGalloway the reaping of the last standing corn is called "cutting\r\nthe Hare." The mode of cutting it is as follows. When the rest of\r\nthe corn has been reaped, a handful is left standing to form the\r\nHare. It is divided into three parts and plaited, and the ears are\r\ntied in a knot. The reapers then retire a few yards and each throws\r\nhis or her sickle in turn at the Hare to cut it down. It must be cut\r\nbelow the knot, and the reapers continue to throw their sickles at\r\nit, one after the other, until one of them succeeds in severing the\r\nstalks below the knot. The Hare is then carried home and given to a\r\nmaidservant in the kitchen, who places it over the kitchen-door on\r\nthe inside. Sometimes the Hare used to be thus kept till the next\r\nharvest. In the parish of Minnigaff, when the Hare was cut, the\r\nunmarried reapers ran home with all speed, and the one who arrived\r\nfirst was the first to be married. In Germany also one of the names\r\nfor the last sheaf is the Hare. Thus in some parts of Anhalt, when\r\nthe corn has been reaped and only a few stalks are left standing,\r\nthey say, "The Hare will soon come," or the reapers cry to each\r\nother, "Look how the Hare comes jumping out." In East Prussia they\r\nsay that the Hare sits in the last patch of standing corn, and must\r\nbe chased out by the last reaper. The reapers hurry with their work,\r\neach being anxious not to have "to chase out the Hare"; for the man\r\nwho does so, that is, who cuts the last corn, is much laughed at. At\r\nAurich, as we have seen, an expression for cutting the last corn is\r\n"to cut off the Hare\'s tail." "He is killing the Hare" is commonly\r\nsaid of the man who cuts the last corn in Germany, Sweden, Holland,\r\nFrance, and Italy. In Norway the man who is thus said to "kill the\r\nHare" must give "hare\'s blood," in the form of brandy, to his\r\nfellows to drink. In Lesbos, when the reapers are at work in two\r\nneighbouring fields, each party tries to finish first in order to\r\ndrive the Hare into their neighbour\'s field; the reapers who succeed\r\nin doing so believe that next year the crop will be better. A small\r\nsheaf of corn is made up and kept beside the holy picture till next\r\nharvest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The Corn-spirit as a Cat\r\n\r\nAGAIN, the corn-spirit sometimes takes the form of a cat. Near Kiel\r\nchildren are warned not to go into the corn-fields because "the Cat\r\nsits there." In the Eisenach Oberland they are told "the Corn-cat\r\nwill come and fetch you," "the Corn-cat goes in the corn." In some\r\nparts of Silesia at mowing the last corn they say, "The Cat is\r\ncaught"; and at threshing, the man who gives the last stroke is\r\ncalled the Cat. In the neighbourhood of Lyons the last sheaf and the\r\nharvest-supper are both called the Cat. About Vesoul when they cut\r\nthe last corn they say, "We have the Cat by the tail." At Brian\xe7on,\r\nin Dauphin\xe9, at the beginning of reaping, a cat is decked out with\r\nribbons, flowers, and ears of corn. It is called the Cat of the\r\nball-skin (_le chat de peau de balle_). If a reaper is wounded at\r\nhis work, they make the cat lick the wound. At the close of the\r\nreaping the cat is again decked out with ribbons and ears of corn;\r\nthen they dance and make merry. When the dance is over the girls\r\nsolemnly strip the cat of its finery. At Gr\xfcneberg, in Silesia, the\r\nreaper who cuts the last corn goes by the name of the Tom-cat. He is\r\nenveloped in rye-stalks and green withes, and is furnished with a\r\nlong plaited tail. Sometimes as a companion he has a man similarly\r\ndressed, who is called the (female) Cat. Their duty is to run after\r\npeople whom they see and to beat them with a long stick. Near Amiens\r\nthe expression for finishing the harvest is, "They are going to kill\r\nthe Cat"; and when the last corn is cut they kill a cat in the\r\nfarmyard. At threshing, in some parts of France, a live cat is\r\nplaced under the last bundle of corn to be threshed, and is struck\r\ndead with the flails. Then on Sunday it is roasted and eaten as a\r\nholiday dish. In the Vosges Mountains the close of haymaking or\r\nharvest is called "catching the cat," "killing the dog," or more\r\nrarely "catching the hare." The cat, the dog, or the hare is said to\r\nbe fat or lean according as the crop is good or bad. The man who\r\ncuts the last handful of hay or of wheat is said to catch the cat or\r\nthe hare or to kill the dog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. The Corn-spirit as a Goat\r\n\r\nFURTHER, the corn-spirit often appears in the form of a goat. In\r\nsome parts of Prussia, when the corn bends before the wind, they\r\nsay, "The Goats are chasing each other," "the wind is driving the\r\nGoats through the corn," "the Goats are browsing there," and they\r\nexpect a very good harvest. Again they say, "The Oats-goat is\r\nsitting in the oats-field," "the Corn-goat is sitting in the\r\nrye-field." Children are warned not to go into the corn-fields to\r\npluck the blue corn-flowers, or amongst the beans to pluck pods,\r\nbecause the Rye-goat, the Corn-goat, the Oats-goat, or the Bean-goat\r\nis sitting or lying there, and will carry them away or kill them.\r\nWhen a harvester is taken sick or lags behind his fellows at their\r\nwork, they call out, "The Harvest-goat has pushed him," "he has been\r\npushed by the Corn-goat." In the neighbourhood of Braunsberg (East\r\nPrussia) at binding the oats every harvester makes haste "lest the\r\nCorn-goat push him." At Oefoten, in Norway, each reaper has his\r\nallotted patch to reap. When a reaper in the middle has not finished\r\nreaping his piece after his neighbours have finished theirs, they\r\nsay of him, "He remains on the island." And if the laggard is a man,\r\nthey imitate the cry with which they call a he-goat; if a woman, the\r\ncry with which they call a she-goat. Near Straubing, in Lower\r\nBavaria, it is said of the man who cuts the last corn that "he has\r\nthe Corn-goat, or the Wheat-goat, or the Oats-goat," according to\r\nthe crop. Moreover, two horns are set up on the last heap of corn,\r\nand it is called "the horned Goat." At Kreutzburg, East Prussia,\r\nthey call out to the woman who is binding the last sheaf, "The Goat\r\nis sitting in the sheaf." At Gablingen, in Swabia, when the last\r\nfield of oats upon a farm is being reaped, the reapers carve a goat\r\nout of wood. Ears of oats are inserted in its nostrils and mouth,\r\nand it is adorned with garlands of flowers. It is set up on the\r\nfield and called the Oats-goat. When the reaping approaches an end,\r\neach reaper hastens to finish his piece first; he who is the last to\r\nfinish gets the Oats-goat. Again, the last sheaf is itself called\r\nthe Goat. Thus, in the valley of the Wiesent, Bavaria, the last\r\nsheaf bound on the field is called the Goat, and they have a\r\nproverb, "The field must bear a goat." At Spachbr\xfccken, in Hesse,\r\nthe last handful of corn which is cut is called the Goat, and the\r\nman who cuts it is much ridiculed. At D\xfcrrenb\xfcchig and about Mosbach\r\nin Baden the last sheaf is also called the Goat. Sometimes the last\r\nsheaf is made up in the form of a goat, and they say, "The Goat is\r\nsitting in it." Again, the person who cuts or binds the last sheaf\r\nis called the Goat. Thus, in parts of Mecklenburg they call out to\r\nthe woman who binds the last sheaf, "You are the Harvest-goat." Near\r\nUelzen, in Hanover, the harvest festival begins with "the bringing\r\nof the Harvest-goat"; that is, the woman who bound the last sheaf is\r\nwrapt in straw, crowned with a harvest-wreath, and brought in a\r\nwheel-barrow to the village, where a round dance takes place. About\r\nLuneburg, also, the woman who binds the last corn is decked with a\r\ncrown of corn-ears and is called the Corn-goat. At M\xfcnzesheim in\r\nBaden the reaper who cuts the last handful of corn or oats is called\r\nthe Corn-goat or the Oats-goat. In the Canton St. Gall, Switzerland,\r\nthe person who cuts the last handful of corn on the field, or drives\r\nthe last harvest-waggon to the barn, is called the Corn-goat or the\r\nRye-goat, or simply the Goat. In the Canton Thurgau he is called\r\nCorn-goat; like a goat he has a bell hung round his neck, is led in\r\ntriumph, and drenched with liquor. In parts of Styria, also, the man\r\nwho cuts the last corn is called Corn-goat, Oats-goat, or the like.\r\nAs a rule, the man who thus gets the name of Corn-goat has to bear\r\nit a whole year till the next harvest.\r\n\r\nAccording to one view, the corn-spirit, who has been caught in the\r\nform of a goat or otherwise, lives in the farmhouse or barn over\r\nwinter. Thus, each farm has its own embodiment of the corn-spirit.\r\nBut, according to another view, the corn-spirit is the genius or\r\ndeity, not of the corn of one farm only, but of all the corn. Hence\r\nwhen the corn on one farm is all cut, he flees to another where\r\nthere is still corn left standing. This idea is brought out in a\r\nharvest-custom which was formerly observed in Skye. The farmer who\r\nfirst finished reaping sent a man or woman with a sheaf to a\r\nneighbouring farmer who had not finished; the latter in his turn,\r\nwhen he had finished, sent on the sheaf to his neighbour who was\r\nstill reaping; and so the sheaf made the round of the farms till all\r\nthe corn was cut. The sheaf was called the _goabbir bhacagh,_ that\r\nis, the Cripple Goat. The custom appears not to be extinct at the\r\npresent day, for it was reported from Skye not very many years ago.\r\nThe corn-spirit was probably thus represented as lame because he had\r\nbeen crippled by the cutting of the corn. Sometimes the old woman\r\nwho brings home the last sheaf must limp on one foot.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes the corn-spirit, in the form of a goat, is believed to\r\nbe slain on the harvest-field by the sickle or scythe. Thus, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Bernkastel, on the Moselle, the reapers determine\r\nby lot the order in which they shall follow each other. The first is\r\ncalled the fore-reaper, the last the tail-bearer. If a reaper\r\novertakes the man in front he reaps past him, bending round so as to\r\nleave the slower reaper in a patch by himself. This patch is called\r\nthe Goat; and the man for whom "the Goat is cut" in this way, is\r\nlaughed and jeered at by his fellows for the rest of the day. When\r\nthe tail-bearer cuts the last ears of corn, it is said, "He is\r\ncutting the Goat\'s neck off." In the neighbourhood of Grenoble,\r\nbefore the end of the reaping, a live goat is adorned with flowers\r\nand ribbons and allowed to run about the field. The reapers chase it\r\nand try to catch it. When it is caught, the farmer\'s wife holds it\r\nfast while the farmer cuts off its head. The goat\'s flesh serves to\r\nfurnish the harvest-supper. A piece of the flesh is pickled and kept\r\ntill the next harvest, when another goat is killed. Then all the\r\nharvesters eat of the flesh. On the same day the skin of the goat is\r\nmade into a cloak, which the farmer, who works with his men, must\r\nalways wear at harvest-time if rain or bad weather sets in. But if a\r\nreaper gets pains in his back, the farmer gives him the goat-skin to\r\nwear. The reason for this seems to be that the pains in the back,\r\nbeing inflicted by the corn-spirit, can also be healed by it.\r\nSimilarly, we saw that elsewhere, when a reaper is wounded at\r\nreaping, a cat, as the representative of the corn-spirit, is made to\r\nlick the wound. Esthonian reapers of the island of Mon think that\r\nthe man who cuts the first ears of corn at harvest will get pains in\r\nhis back, probably because the corn-spirit is believed to resent\r\nespecially the first wound; and, in order to escape pains in the\r\nback, Saxon reapers in Transylvania gird their loins with the first\r\nhandful of ears which they cut. Here, again, the corn-spirit is\r\napplied to for healing or protection, but in his original vegetable\r\nform, not in the form of a goat or a cat.\r\n\r\nFurther, the corn-spirit under the form of a goat is sometimes\r\nconceived as lurking among the cut corn in the barn, till he is\r\ndriven from it by the threshing-flail. Thus in Baden the last sheaf\r\nto be threshed is called the Corn-goat, the Spelt-goat, or the\r\nOats-goat according to the kind of grain. Again, near Marktl, in\r\nUpper Bavaria, the sheaves are called Straw-goats or simply Goats.\r\nThey are laid in a great heap on the open field and threshed by two\r\nrows of men standing opposite each other, who, as they ply their\r\nflails, sing a song in which they say that they see the Straw-goat\r\namongst the corn-stalks. The last Goat, that is, the last sheaf, is\r\nadorned with a wreath of violets and other flowers and with cakes\r\nstrung together. It is placed right in the middle of the heap. Some\r\nof the threshers rush at it and tear the best of it out; others lay\r\non with their flails so recklessly that heads are sometimes broken.\r\nAt Oberinntal, in the Tyrol, the last thresher is called Goat. So at\r\nHaselberg, in West Bohemia, the man who gives the last stroke at\r\nthreshing oats is called the Oats-goat. At Tettnang, in W\xfcrtemburg,\r\nthe thresher who gives the last stroke to the last bundle of corn\r\nbefore it is turned goes by the name of the He-goat, and it is said,\r\n"He has driven the He-goat away." The person who, after the bundle\r\nhas been turned, gives the last stroke of all, is called the\r\nShe-goat. In this custom it is implied that the corn is inhabited by\r\na pair of corn-spirits, male and female.\r\n\r\nFurther, the corn-spirit, captured in the form of a goat at\r\nthreshing, is passed on to a neighbour whose threshing is not yet\r\nfinished. In Franche Comt\xe9, as soon as the threshing is over, the\r\nyoung people set up a straw figure of a goat on the farmyard of a\r\nneighbour who is still threshing. He must give them wine or money in\r\nreturn. At Ellwangen, in W\xfcrtemburg, the effigy of a goat is made\r\nout of the last bundle of corn at threshing; four sticks form its\r\nlegs, and two its horns. The man who gives the last stroke with the\r\nflail must carry the Goat to the barn of a neighbour who is still\r\nthreshing and throw it down on the floor; if he is caught in the\r\nact, they tie the Goat on his back. A similar custom is observed at\r\nIndersdorf, in Upper Bavaria; the man who throws the straw Goat into\r\nthe neighbour\'s barn imitates the bleating of a goat; if they catch\r\nhim, they blacken his face and tie the Goat on his back. At Saverne,\r\nin Alsace, when a farmer is a week or more behind his neighbours\r\nwith his threshing, they set a real stuffed goat or fox before his\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nSometimes the spirit of the corn in goat form is believed to be\r\nkilled at threshing. In the district of Traunstein, Upper Bavaria,\r\nthey think that the Oats-goat is in the last sheaf of oats. He is\r\nrepresented by an old rake set up on end, with an old pot for a\r\nhead. The children are then told to kill the Oats-goat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. The Corn-spirit as a Bull, Cow, or Ox\r\n\r\nANOTHER form which the corn-spirit often assumes is that of a bull,\r\ncow, or ox. When the wind sweeps over the corn they say at Conitz,\r\nin West Prussia, "The Steer is running in the corn"; when the corn\r\nis thick and strong in one spot, they say in some parts of East\r\nPrussia, "The Bull is lying in the corn." When a harvester has\r\noverstrained and lamed himself, they say in the Graudenz district of\r\nWest Prussia, "The Bull pushed him"; in Lorraine they say, "He has\r\nthe Bull." The meaning of both expressions is that he has\r\nunwittingly lighted upon the divine corn-spirit, who has punished\r\nthe profane intruder with lameness. So near Chamb\xe9ry when a reaper\r\nwounds himself with his sickle, it is said that he has "the wound of\r\nthe Ox." In the district of Bunzlau (Silesia) the last sheaf is\r\nsometimes made into the shape of a horned ox, stuffed with tow and\r\nwrapt in corn-ears. This figure is called the Old Man. In some parts\r\nof Bohemia the last sheaf is made up in human form and called the\r\nBuffalo-bull. These cases show a confusion of the human with the\r\nanimal shape of the corn-spirit. The confusion is like that of\r\nkilling a wether under the name of a wolf. All over Swabia the last\r\nbundle of corn on the field is called the Cow; the man who cuts the\r\nlast ears "has the Cow," and is himself called Cow or Barley-cow or\r\nOats-cow, according to the crop; at the harvest-supper he gets a\r\nnosegay of flowers and corn-ears and a more liberal allowance of\r\ndrink than the rest. But he is teased and laughed at; so no one\r\nlikes to be the Cow. The Cow was sometimes represented by the figure\r\nof a woman made out of ears of corn and corn-flowers. It was carried\r\nto the farmhouse by the man who had cut the last handful of corn.\r\nThe children ran after him and the neighbours turned out to laugh at\r\nhim, till the farmer took the Cow from him. Here again the confusion\r\nbetween the human and the animal form of the corn-spirit is\r\napparent. In various parts of Switzerland the reaper who cuts the\r\nlast ears of corn is called Wheat-cow, Corn-cow, Oats-cow, or\r\nCorn-steer, and is the butt of many a joke. On the other hand, in\r\nthe district of Rosenheim, Upper Bavaria, when a farmer is later of\r\ngetting in his harvest than his neighbours, they set up on his land\r\na Straw-bull, as it is called. This is a gigantic figure of a bull\r\nmade of stubble on a framework of wood and adorned with flowers and\r\nleaves. Attached to it is a label on which are scrawled doggerel\r\nverses in ridicule of the man on whose land the Straw-bull is set\r\nup.\r\n\r\nAgain, the corn-spirit in the form of a bull or ox is killed on the\r\nharvest-field at the close of the reaping. At Pouilly, near Dijon,\r\nwhen the last ears of corn are about to be cut, an ox adorned with\r\nribbons, flowers, and ears of corn is led all round the field,\r\nfollowed by the whole troop of reapers dancing. Then a man disguised\r\nas the Devil cuts the last ears of corn and immediately slaughters\r\nthe ox. Part of the flesh of the animal is eaten at the\r\nharvest-supper; part is pickled and kept till the first day of\r\nsowing in spring. At Pont \xe0 Mousson and elsewhere on the evening of\r\nthe last day of reaping, a calf adorned with flowers and ears of\r\ncorn is led thrice round the farmyard, being allured by a bait or\r\ndriven by men with sticks, or conducted by the farmer\'s wife with a\r\nrope. The calf chosen for this ceremony is the calf which was born\r\nfirst on the farm in the spring of the year. It is followed by all\r\nthe reapers with their tools. Then it is allowed to run free; the\r\nreapers chase it, and whoever catches it is called King of the Calf.\r\nLastly, it is solemnly killed; at Lun\xe9ville the man who acts as\r\nbutcher is the Jewish merchant of the village.\r\n\r\nSometimes again the corn-spirit hides himself amongst the cut corn\r\nin the barn to reappear in bull or cow form at threshing. Thus at\r\nWurmlingen, in Th\xfcringen, the man who gives the last stroke at\r\nthreshing is called the Cow, or rather the Barley-cow, Oats-cow,\r\nPeas-cow, or the like, according to the crop. He is entirely\r\nenveloped in straw; his head is surmounted by sticks in imitation of\r\nhorns, and two lads lead him by ropes to the well to drink. On the\r\nway thither he must low like a cow, and for a long time afterwards\r\nhe goes by the name of the Cow. At Obermedlingen, in Swabia, when\r\nthe threshing draws near an end, each man is careful to avoid giving\r\nthe last stroke. He who does give it "gets the Cow," which is a\r\nstraw figure dressed in an old ragged petticoat, hood, and\r\nstockings. It is tied on his back with a straw-rope; his face is\r\nblackened, and being bound with straw-ropes to a wheelbarrow he is\r\nwheeled round the village. Here, again, we meet with that confusion\r\nbetween the human and animal shape of the corn-spirit which we have\r\nnoted in other customs. In Canton Schaffhausen the man who threshes\r\nthe last corn is called the Cow; in Canton Thurgau, the Corn-bull;\r\nin Canton Zurich, the Thresher-cow. In the last-mentioned district\r\nhe is wrapt in straw and bound to one of the trees in the orchard.\r\nAt Arad, in Hungary, the man who gives the last stroke at threshing\r\nis enveloped in straw and a cow\'s hide with the horns attached to\r\nit. At Pessnitz, in the district of Dresden, the man who gives the\r\nlast stroke with the flail is called Bull. He must make a straw-man\r\nand set it up before a neighbour\'s window. Here, apparently, as in\r\nso many cases, the corn-spirit is passed on to a neighbour who has\r\nnot finished threshing. So at Herbrechtingen, in Th\xfcringen, the\r\neffigy of a ragged old woman is flung into the barn of the farmer\r\nwho is last with his threshing. The man who throws it in cries,\r\n"There is the Cow for you." If the threshers catch him they detain\r\nhim over night and punish him by keeping him from the\r\nharvest-supper. In these latter customs the confusion between the\r\nhuman and the animal shape of the corn-spirit meets us again.\r\n\r\nFurther, the corn-spirit in bull form is sometimes believed to be\r\nkilled at threshing. At Auxerre, in threshing the last bundle of\r\ncorn, they call out twelve times, "We are killing the Bull." In the\r\nneighbourhood of Bordeaux, where a butcher kills an ox on the field\r\nimmediately after the close of the reaping, it is said of the man\r\nwho gives the last stroke at threshing that "he has killed the\r\nBull." At Chamb\xe9ry the last sheaf is called the sheaf of the Young\r\nOx, and a race takes place to it in which all the reapers join. When\r\nthe last stroke is given at threshing they say that "the Ox is\r\nkilled"; and immediately thereupon a real ox is slaughtered by the\r\nreaper who cut the last corn. The flesh of the ox is eaten by the\r\nthreshers at supper.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that sometimes the young corn-spirit, whose task it is\r\nto quicken the corn of the coming year, is believed to be born as a\r\nCorn-baby on the harvest-field. Similarly in Berry the young\r\ncorn-spirit is sometimes supposed to be born on the field in calf\r\nform; for when a binder has not rope enough to bind all the corn in\r\nsheaves, he puts aside the wheat that remains over and imitates the\r\nlowing of a cow. The meaning is that "the sheaf has given birth to a\r\ncalf." In Puy-de-D\xf4me when a binder cannot keep up with the reaper\r\nwhom he or she follows, they say "He (or she) is giving birth to the\r\nCalf." In some parts of Prussia, in similar circumstances, they call\r\nout to the woman, "The Bull is coming," and imitate the bellowing of\r\na bull. In these cases the woman is conceived as the Corn-cow or old\r\ncorn-spirit, while the supposed calf is the Corn-calf or young\r\ncorn-spirit. In some parts of Austria a mythical calf\r\n(_Muhk\xe4lbchen_) is believed to be seen amongst the sprouting corn in\r\nspring and to push the children; when the corn waves in the wind\r\nthey say, "The Calf is going about." Clearly, as Mannhardt observes,\r\nthis calf of the spring-time is the same animal which is afterwards\r\nbelieved to be killed at reaping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. The Corn-spirit as a Horse or Mare\r\n\r\nSOMETIMES the corn-spirit appears in the shape of a horse or mare.\r\nBetween Kalw and Stuttgart, when the corn bends before the wind,\r\nthey say, "There runs the Horse." At Bohlingen, near Radolfzell in\r\nBaden, the last sheaf of oats is called the Oats-stallion. In\r\nHertfordshire, at the end of the reaping, there is or used to be\r\nobserved a ceremony called "crying the Mare." The last blades of\r\ncorn left standing on the field are tied together and called the\r\nMare. The reapers stand at a distance and throw their sickles at it;\r\nhe who cuts it through "has the prize, with acclamations and good\r\ncheer." After it is cut the reapers cry thrice with a loud voice, "I\r\nhave her!" Others answer thrice, "What have you?"--"A Mare! a Mare!\r\na Mare!"--"Whose is she?" is next asked thrice. "A. B.\'s," naming\r\nthe owner thrice. "Whither will you send her?"--"To C. D.," naming\r\nsome neighbour who has not reaped all his corn. In this custom the\r\ncorn-spirit in the form of a mare is passed on from a farm where the\r\ncorn is all cut to another farm where it is still standing, and\r\nwhere therefore the corn-spirit may be supposed naturally to take\r\nrefuge. In Shropshire the custom is similar. The farmer who finishes\r\nhis harvest last, and who therefore cannot send the Mare to any one\r\nelse, is said "to keep her all winter." The mocking offer of the\r\nMare to a laggard neighbour was sometimes responded to by a mocking\r\nacceptance of her help. Thus an old man told an inquirer, "While we\r\nwun at supper, a mon cumm\'d wi\' a autar [halter] to fatch her away."\r\nAt one place a real mare used to be sent, but the man who rode her\r\nwas subjected to some rough treatment at the farmhouse to which he\r\npaid his unwelcome visit.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Lille the idea of the corn-spirit in horse\r\nform in clearly preserved. When a harvester grows weary at his work,\r\nit is said, "He has the fatigue of the Horse." The first sheaf,\r\ncalled the "Cross of the Horse," is placed on a cross of boxwood in\r\nthe barn, and the youngest horse on the farm must tread on it. The\r\nreapers dance round the last blades of corn, crying, "See the\r\nremains of the Horse." The sheaf made out of these last blades is\r\ngiven to the youngest horse of the parish (_commune_) to eat. This\r\nyoungest horse of the parish clearly represents, as Mannhardt says,\r\nthe corn-spirit of the following year, the Corn-foal, which absorbs\r\nthe spirit of the old Corn-horse by eating the last corn cut; for,\r\nas usual, the old corn-spirit takes his final refuge in the last\r\nsheaf. The thresher of the last sheaf is said to "beat the Horse."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9. The Corn-spirit as a Pig (Boar or Sow)\r\n\r\nTHE LAST animal embodiment of the corn-spirit which we shall notice\r\nis the pig (boar or sow). In Th\xfcringen, when the wind sets the young\r\ncorn in motion, they sometimes say, "The Boar is rushing through the\r\ncorn." Amongst the Esthonians of the island of Oesel the last sheaf\r\nis called the Ryeboar, and the man who gets it is saluted with a cry\r\nof "You have the Rye-boar on your back!" In reply he strikes up a\r\nsong, in which he prays for plenty. At Kohlerwinkel, near Augsburg,\r\nat the close of the harvest, the last bunch of standing corn is cut\r\ndown, stalk by stalk, by all the reapers in turn. He who cuts the\r\nlast stalk "gets the Sow," and is laughed at. In other Swabian\r\nvillages also the man who cuts the last corn "has the Sow," or "has\r\nthe Rye-sow." At Bohlingen, near Radolfzell in Baden, the last sheaf\r\nis called the Rye-sow or the Wheat-sow, according to the crop; and\r\nat R\xf6hrenbach in Baden the person who brings the last armful for the\r\nlast sheaf is called the Corn-sow or the Oats-sow. At Friedingen, in\r\nSwabia, the thresher who gives the last stroke is called\r\nSow--Barley-sow, Corn-sow, or the like, according to the crop. At\r\nOnstmettingen the man who gives the last stroke at threshing "has\r\nthe Sow"; he is often bound up in a sheaf and dragged by a rope\r\nalong the ground. And, generally, in Swabia the man who gives the\r\nlast stroke with the flail is called Sow. He may, however, rid\r\nhimself of this invidious distinction by passing on to a neighbour\r\nthe straw-rope, which is the badge of his position as Sow. So he\r\ngoes to a house and throws the straw-rope into it, crying, "There, I\r\nbring you the Sow." All the inmates give chase; and if they catch\r\nhim they beat him, shut him up for several hours in the pig-sty, and\r\noblige him to take the "Sow" away again. In various parts of Upper\r\nBavaria the man who gives the last stroke at threshing must "carry\r\nthe Pig"--that is, either a straw effigy of a pig or merely a bundle\r\nof straw-ropes. This he carries to a neighbouring farm where the\r\nthreshing is not finished, and throws it into the barn. If the\r\nthreshers catch him they handle him roughly, beating him, blackening\r\nor dirtying his face, throwing him into filth, binding the Sow on\r\nhis back, and so on; if the bearer of the Sow is a woman they cut\r\noff her hair. At the harvest supper or dinner the man who "carried\r\nthe Pig" gets one or more dumplings made in the form of pigs. When\r\nthe dumplings are served up by the maidservant, all the people at\r\ntable cry "S\xfcz, s\xfcz, s\xfcz !" that being the cry used in calling pigs.\r\nSometimes after dinner the man who "carried the Pig" has his face\r\nblackened, and is set on a cart and drawn round the village by his\r\nfellows, followed by a crowd crying "S\xfcz, s\xfcz, s\xfcz !" as if they\r\nwere calling swine. Sometimes, after being wheeled round the\r\nvillage, he is flung on the dunghill.\r\n\r\nAgain, the corn-spirit in the form of a pig plays his part at\r\nsowing-time as well as at harvest. At Neuautz, in Courland, when\r\nbarley is sown for the first time in the year, the farmer\'s wife\r\nboils the chine of a pig along with the tail, and brings it to the\r\nsower on the field. He eats of it, but cuts off the tail and sticks\r\nit in the field; it is believed that the ears of corn will then grow\r\nas long as the tail. Here the pig is the corn-spirit, whose\r\nfertilising power is sometimes supposed to lie especially in his\r\ntail. As a pig he is put in the ground at sowing-time, and as a pig\r\nhe reappears amongst the ripe corn at harvest. For amongst the\r\nneighbouring Esthonians, as we have seen, the last sheaf is called\r\nthe Rye-boar. Somewhat similar customs are observed in Germany. In\r\nthe Salza district, near Meiningen, a certain bone in the pig is\r\ncalled "the Jew on the winnowing-fan." The flesh of this bone is\r\nboiled on Shrove Tuesday, but the bone is put amongst the ashes\r\nwhich the neighbours exchange as presents on St. Peter\'s Day (the\r\ntwenty-second of February), and then mix with the seedcorn. In the\r\nwhole of Hesse, Meiningen, and other districts, people eat pea-soup\r\nwith dried pig-ribs on Ash Wednesday or Candlemas. The ribs are then\r\ncollected and hung in the room till sowing-time, when they are\r\ninserted in the sown field or in the seed-bag amongst the flax seed.\r\nThis is thought to be an infallible specific against earth-fleas and\r\nmoles, and to cause the flax to grow well and tall.\r\n\r\nBut the idea of the corn-spirit as embodied in pig form is nowhere\r\nmore clearly expressed than in the Scandinavian custom of the Yule\r\nBoar. In Sweden and Denmark at Yule (Christmas) it is the custom to\r\nbake a loaf in the form of a boar-pig. This is called the Yule Boar.\r\nThe corn of the last sheaf is often used to make it. All through\r\nYule the Yule Boar stands on the table. Often it is kept till the\r\nsowing-time in spring, when part of it is mixed with the seed-corn\r\nand part given to the ploughman and plough-horses or ploughoxen to\r\neat, in the expectation of a good harvest. In this custom the\r\ncorn-spirit, immanent in the last sheaf, appears at midwinter in the\r\nform of a boar made from the corn of the last sheaf; and his\r\nquickening influence on the corn is shown by mixing part of the Yule\r\nBoar with the seed-corn, and giving part of it to the ploughman and\r\nhis cattle to eat. Similarly we saw that the Corn-wolf makes his\r\nappearance at mid-winter, the time when the year begins to verge\r\ntowards spring. Formerly a real boar was sacrificed at Christmas,\r\nand apparently also a man in the character of the Yule Boar. This,\r\nat least, may perhaps be inferred from a Christmas custom still\r\nobserved in Sweden. A man is wrapt up in a skin, and carries a wisp\r\nof straw in his mouth, so that the projecting straws look like the\r\nbristles of a boar. A knife is brought, and an old woman, with her\r\nface blackened, pretends to sacrifice him.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Eve in some parts of the Esthonian island of Oesel they\r\nbake a long cake with the two ends turned up. It is called the\r\nChristmas Boar, and stands on the table till the morning of New\r\nYear\'s Day, when it is distributed among the cattle. In other parts\r\nof the island the Christmas Boar is not a cake but a little pig born\r\nin March, which the housewife fattens secretly, often without the\r\nknowledge of the other members of the family. On Christmas Eve the\r\nlittle pig is secretly killed, then roasted in the oven, and set on\r\nthe table standing on all fours, where it remains in this posture\r\nfor several days. In other parts of the island, again, though the\r\nChristmas cake has neither the name nor the shape of a boar, it is\r\nkept till the New Year, when half of it is divided among all the\r\nmembers and all the quadrupeds of the family. The other half of the\r\ncake is kept till sowing-time comes round, when it is similarly\r\ndistributed in the morning among human beings and beasts. In other\r\nparts of Esthonia, again, the Christmas Boar, as it is called, is\r\nbaked of the first rye cut at harvest; it has a conical shape and a\r\ncross is impressed on it with a pig\'s bone or a key, or three dints\r\nare made in it with a buckle or a piece of charcoal. It stands with\r\na light beside it on the table all through the festal season. On New\r\nYear\'s Day and Epiphany, before sunrise, a little of the cake is\r\ncrumbled with salt and given to the cattle. The rest is kept till\r\nthe day when the cattle are driven out to pasture for the first time\r\nin spring. It is then put in the herdsman\'s bag, and at evening is\r\ndivided among the cattle to guard them from magic and harm. In some\r\nplaces the Christmas Boar is partaken of by farm-servants and cattle\r\nat the time of the barley sowing, for the purpose of thereby\r\nproducing a heavier crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10. On the Animal Embodiments of the Corn-spirit\r\n\r\nSO much for the animal embodiments of the corn-spirit as they are\r\npresented to us in the folk-customs of Northern Europe. These\r\ncustoms bring out clearly the sacramental character of the\r\nharvest-supper. The corn-spirit is conceived as embodied in an\r\nanimal; this divine animal is slain, and its flesh and blood are\r\npartaken of by the harvesters. Thus the cock, the hare, the cat, the\r\ngoat, and the OX are eaten sacramentally by the harvester, and the\r\npig is eaten sacramentally by ploughmen in spring. Again, as a\r\nsubstitute for the real flesh of the divine being, bread or\r\ndumplings are made in his image and eaten sacramentally; thus,\r\npig-shaped dumplings are eaten by the harvesters, and loaves made in\r\nboar-shape (the Yule Boar) are eaten in spring by the ploughman and\r\nhis cattle.\r\n\r\nThe reader has probably remarked the complete parallelism between\r\nthe conceptions of the corn-spirit in human and in animal form. The\r\nparallel may be here briefly resumed. When the corn waves in the\r\nwind it is said either that the Corn-mother or that the Corn-wolf,\r\netc., is passing through the corn. Children are warned against\r\nstraying in corn-fields either because the Corn-mother or because\r\nthe Corn-wolf, etc., is there. In the last corn cut or the last\r\nsheaf threshed either the Corn-mother or the Corn-wolf, etc., is\r\nsupposed to be present. The last sheaf is itself called either the\r\nCorn-mother or the Corn-wolf, etc., and is made up in the shape\r\neither of a woman or of a wolf, etc. The person who cuts, binds, or\r\nthreshes the last sheaf is called either the Old Woman or the Wolf,\r\netc., according to the name bestowed on the sheaf itself. As in some\r\nplaces a sheaf made in human form and called the Maiden, the Mother\r\nof the Maize, etc., is kept from one harvest to the next in order to\r\nsecure a continuance of the corn-spirit\'s blessing, so in some\r\nplaces the Harvest-cock and in others the flesh of the goat is kept\r\nfor a similar purpose from one harvest to the next. As in some\r\nplaces the grain taken from the Corn-mother is mixed with the\r\nseed-corn in spring to make the crop abundant, so in some places the\r\nfeathers of the cock, and in Sweden the Yule Boar, are kept till\r\nspring and mixed with the seed-corn for a like purpose. As part of\r\nthe Corn-mother or Maiden is given to the cattle at Christmas or to\r\nthe horses at the first ploughing, so part of the Yule Boar is given\r\nto the ploughing horses or oxen in spring. Lastly, the death of the\r\ncorn-spirit is represented by killing or pretending to kill either\r\nhis human or his animal representative; and the worshippers partake\r\nsacramentally either of the actual body and blood of the\r\nrepresentative of the divinity, or of bread made in his likeness.\r\n\r\nOther animal forms assumed by the corn-spirit are the fox, stag,\r\nroe, sheep, bear, ass, mouse, quail, stork, swan, and kite. If it is\r\nasked why the corn-spirit should be thought to appear in the form of\r\nan animal and of so many different animals, we may reply that to\r\nprimitive man the simple appearance of an animal or bird among the\r\ncorn is probably enough to suggest a mysterious link between the\r\ncreature and the corn; and when we remember that in the old days,\r\nbefore fields were fenced in, all kinds of animals must have been\r\nfree to roam over them, we need not wonder that the corn-spirit\r\nshould have been identified even with large animals like the horse\r\nand cow, which nowadays could not, except by a rare accident, be\r\nfound straying in an English corn-field. This explanation applies\r\nwith peculiar force to the very common case in which the animal\r\nembodiment of the corn-spirit is believed to lurk in the last\r\nstanding corn. For at harvest a number of wild animals, such as\r\nhares, rabbits, and partridges, are commonly driven by the progress\r\nof the reaping into the last patch of standing corn, and make their\r\nescape from it as it is being cut down. So regularly does this\r\nhappen that reapers and others often stand round the last patch of\r\ncorn armed with sticks or guns, with which they kill the animals as\r\nthey dart out of their last refuge among the stalks. Now, primitive\r\nman, to whom magical changes of shape seem perfectly credible, finds\r\nit most natural that the spirit of the corn, driven from his home in\r\nthe ripe grain, should make his escape in the form of the animal\r\nwhich is seen to rush out of the last patch of corn as it falls\r\nunder the scythe of the reaper. Thus the identification of the\r\ncorn-spirit with an animal is analogous to the identification of him\r\nwith a passing stranger. As the sudden appearance of a stranger near\r\nthe harvest-field or threshing-floor is, to the primitive mind,\r\nenough to identify him as the spirit of the corn escaping from the\r\ncut or threshed corn, so the sudden appearance of an animal issuing\r\nfrom the cut corn is enough to identify it with the corn-spirit\r\nescaping from his ruined home. The two identifications are so\r\nanalogous that they can hardly be dissociated in any attempt to\r\nexplain them. Those who look to some other principle than the one\r\nhere suggested for the explanation of the latter identification are\r\nbound to show that their theory covers the former identification\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIX. Ancient Deities of Vegetation as Animals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Dionysus, the Goat and the Bull\r\n\r\nHOWEVER we may explain it, the fact remains that in peasant\r\nfolk-lore the corn-spirit is very commonly conceived and represented\r\nin animal form. May not this fact explain the relation in which\r\ncertain animals stood to the ancient deities of vegetation,\r\nDionysus, Demeter, Adonis, Attis, and Osiris?\r\n\r\nTo begin with Dionysus. We have seen that he was represented\r\nsometimes as a goat and sometimes as a bull. As a goat he can hardly\r\nbe separated from the minor divinities, the Pans, Satyrs, and\r\nSilenuses, all of whom are closely associated with him and are\r\nrepresented more or less completely in the form of goats. Thus, Pan\r\nwas regularly portrayed in sculpture and painting with the face and\r\nlegs of a goat. The Satyrs were depicted with pointed goat-ears, and\r\nsometimes with sprouting horns and short tails. They were sometimes\r\nspoken of simply as goats; and in the drama their parts were played\r\nby men dressed in goatskins. Silenus is represented in art clad in a\r\ngoatskin. Further, the Fauns, the Italian counterpart of the Greek\r\nPans and Satyrs, are described as being half goats, with goat-feet\r\nand goat-horns. Again, all these minor goat-formed divinities\r\npartake more or less clearly of the character of woodland deities.\r\nThus, Pan was called by the Arcadians the Lord of the Wood. The\r\nSilenuses kept company with the tree-nymphs. The Fauns are expressly\r\ndesignated as woodland deities; and their character as such is still\r\nfurther brought out by their association, or even identification,\r\nwith Silvanus and the Silvanuses, who, as their name of itself\r\nindicates, are spirits of the woods. Lastly, the association of the\r\nSatyrs with the Silenuses, Fauns, and Silvanuses, proves that the\r\nSatyrs also were woodland deities. These goat-formed spirits of the\r\nwoods have their counterparts in the folk-lore of Northern Europe.\r\nThus, the Russian wood-spirits, called _Ljeschie_ (from _ljes,_\r\n"wood"), are believed to appear partly in human shape, but with the\r\nhorns, ears, and legs of goats. The _Ljeschi_ can alter his stature\r\nat pleasure; when he walks in the wood he is as tall as the trees;\r\nwhen he walks in the meadows he is no higher than the grass. Some of\r\nthe _Ljeschie_ are spirits of the corn as well as of the wood;\r\nbefore harvest they are as tall as the corn-stalks, but after it\r\nthey shrink to the height of the stubble. This brings out--what we\r\nhave remarked before--the close connexion between tree-spirits and\r\ncorn-spirits, and shows how easily the former may melt into the\r\nlatter. Similarly the Fauns, though wood-spirits, were believed to\r\nfoster the growth of the crops. We have already seen how often the\r\ncorn-spirit is represented in folk-custom as a goat. On the whole,\r\nthen, as Mannhardt argues, the Pans, Satyrs, and Fauns perhaps\r\nbelong to a widely diffused class of wood-spirits conceived in\r\ngoat-form. The fondness of goats for straying in woods and nibbling\r\nthe bark of trees, to which indeed they are most destructive, is an\r\nobvious and perhaps sufficient reason why wood-spirits should so\r\noften be supposed to take the form of goats. The inconsistency of a\r\ngod of vegetation subsisting upon the vegetation which he\r\npersonifies is not one to strike the primitive mind. Such\r\ninconsistencies arise when the deity, ceasing to be immanent in the\r\nvegetation, comes to be regarded as its owner or lord; for the idea\r\nof owning the vegetation naturally leads to that of subsisting on\r\nit. Sometimes the corn-spirit, originally conceived as immanent in\r\nthe corn, afterwards comes to be regarded as its owner, who lives on\r\nit and is reduced to poverty and want by being deprived of it. Hence\r\nhe is often known as "the Poor Man" or "the Poor Woman."\r\nOccasionally the last sheaf is left standing on the field for "the\r\nPoor Old Woman" or for "the Old Rye-woman."\r\n\r\nThus the representation of wood-spirits in the form of goats appears\r\nto be both widespread and, to the primitive mind, natural. Therefore\r\nwhen we find, as we have done, that Dionysus--a tree-god--is\r\nsometimes represented in goat-form, we can hardly avoid concluding\r\nthat this representation is simply a part of his proper character as\r\na tree-god and is not to be explained by the fusion of two distinct\r\nand independent worships, in one of which he originally appeared as\r\na tree-god and in the other as a goat.\r\n\r\nDionysus was also figured, as we have seen, in the shape of a bull.\r\nAfter what has gone before we are naturally led to expect that his\r\nbull form must have been only another expression for his character\r\nas a deity of vegetation, especially as the bull is a common\r\nembodiment of the corn-spirit in Northern Europe; and the close\r\nassociation of Dionysus with Demeter and Persephone in the mysteries\r\nof Eleusis shows that he had at least strong agricultural\r\naffinities.\r\n\r\nThe probability of this view will be somewhat increased if it can be\r\nshown that in other rites than those of Dionysus the ancients slew\r\nan OX as a representative of the spirit of vegetation. This they\r\nappear to have done in the Athenian sacrifice known as "the murder\r\nof the OX" (_bouphonia_). It took place about the end of June or\r\nbeginning of July, that is, about the time when the threshing is\r\nnearly over in Attica. According to tradition the sacrifice was\r\ninstituted to procure a cessation of drought and dearth which had\r\nafflicted the land. The ritual was as follows. Barley mixed with\r\nwheat, or cakes made of them, were laid upon the bronze altar of\r\nZeus Polieus on the Acropolis. Oxen were driven round the altar, and\r\nthe OX which went up to the altar and ate the offering on it was\r\nsacrificed. The axe and knife with which the beast was slain had\r\nbeen previously wetted with water brought by maidens called\r\n"water-carriers." The weapons were then sharpened and handed to the\r\nbutchers, one of whom felled the OX with the axe and another cut its\r\nthroat with the knife. As soon as he had felled the OX, the former\r\nthrew the axe from him and fled; and the man who cut the beast\'s\r\nthroat apparently imitated his example. Meantime the OX was skinned\r\nand all present partook of its flesh. Then the hide was stuffed with\r\nstraw and sewed up; next the stuffed animal was set on its feet and\r\nyoked to a plough as if it were ploughing. A trial then took place\r\nin an ancient law-court presided over by the King (as he was called)\r\nto determine who had murdered the OX. The maidens who had brought\r\nthe water accused the men who had sharpened the axe and knife; the\r\nmen who had sharpened the axe and knife blamed the men who had\r\nhanded these implements to the butchers; the men who had handed the\r\nimplements to the butchers blamed the butchers; and the butchers\r\nlaid the blame on the axe and knife, which were accordingly found\r\nguilty, condemned, and cast into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe name of this sacrifice,-- "the _murder_ of the OX,"--the pains\r\ntaken by each person who had a hand in the slaughter to lay the\r\nblame on some one else, together with the formal trial and\r\npunishment of the axe or knife or both, prove that the OX was here\r\nregarded not merely as a victim offered to a god, but as itself a\r\nsacred creature, the slaughter of which was sacrilege or murder.\r\nThis is borne out by a statement of Varro that to kill an OX was\r\nformerly a capital crime in Attica. The mode of selecting the victim\r\nsuggests that the OX which tasted the corn was viewed as the\r\ncorn-deity taking possession of his own. This interpretation is\r\nsupported by the following custom. In Beauce, in the district of\r\nOrleans, on the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth of April they make a\r\nstraw man called "the great _mondard._" For they say that the old\r\n_mondard_ is now dead and it is necessary to make a new one. The\r\nstraw man is carried in solemn procession up and down the village\r\nand at last is placed upon the oldest apple-tree. There he remains\r\ntill the apples are gathered, when he is taken down and thrown into\r\nthe water, or he is burned and his ashes cast into water. But the\r\nperson who plucks the first fruit from the tree succeeds to the\r\ntitle of "the great _mondard._" Here the straw figure, called "the\r\ngreat _mondard_" and placed on the oldest apple-tree in spring,\r\nrepresents the spirit of the tree, who, dead in winter, revives when\r\nthe apple-blossoms appear on the boughs. Thus the person who plucks\r\nthe first fruit from the tree and thereby receives the name of "the\r\ngreat _mondard_" must be regarded as a representative of the\r\ntree-spirit. Primitive peoples are usually reluctant to taste the\r\nannual first-fruits of any crop, until some ceremony has been\r\nperformed which makes it safe and pious for them to do so. The\r\nreason of this reluctance appears to be a belief that the\r\nfirst-fruits either belong to or actually contain a divinity.\r\nTherefore when a man or animal is seen boldly to appropriate the\r\nsacred first-fruits, he or it is naturally regarded as the divinity\r\nhimself in human or animal form taking possession of his own. The\r\ntime of the Athenian sacrifice, which fell about the close of the\r\nthreshing, suggests that the wheat and barley laid upon the altar\r\nwere a harvest offering; and the sacramental character of the\r\nsubsequent repast--all partaking of the flesh of the divine\r\nanimal--would make it parallel to the harvest-suppers of modern\r\nEurope, in which, as we have seen, the flesh of the animal which\r\nstands for the corn-spirit is eaten by the harvesters. Again, the\r\ntradition that the sacrifice was instituted in order to put an end\r\nto drought and famine is in favour of taking it as a harvest\r\nfestival. The resurrection of the corn-spirit, enacted by setting up\r\nthe stuffed OX and yoking it to the plough, may be compared with the\r\nresurrection of the tree-spirit in the person of his representative,\r\nthe Wild Man.\r\n\r\nThe OX appears as a representative of the corn-spirit in other parts\r\nof the world. At Great Bassam, in Guinea, two oxen are slain\r\nannually to procure a good harvest. If the sacrifice is to be\r\neffectual, it is necessary that the oxen should weep. So all the\r\nwomen of the village sit in front of the beasts, chanting, "The OX\r\nwill weep; yes, he will weep!" From time to time one of the women\r\nwalks round the beasts, throwing manioc meal or palm wine upon them,\r\nespecially into their eyes. When tears roll down from the eyes of\r\nthe oxen, the people dance, singing, "The OX weeps! the OX weeps!"\r\nThen two men seize the tails of the beasts and cut them off at one\r\nblow. It is believed that a great misfortune will happen in the\r\ncourse of the year if the tails are not severed at one blow. The\r\noxen are afterwards killed, and their flesh is eaten by the chiefs.\r\nHere the tears of the oxen, like those of the human victims amongst\r\nthe Khonds and the Aztecs, are probably a rain-charm. We have\r\nalready seen that the virtue of the corn-spirit, embodied in animal\r\nform, is sometimes supposed to reside in the tail, and that the last\r\nhandful of corn is sometimes conceived as the tail of the\r\ncorn-spirit. In the Mithraic religion this conception is graphically\r\nset forth in some of the numerous sculptures which represent Mithras\r\nkneeling on the back of a bull and plunging a knife into its flank;\r\nfor on certain of these monuments the tail of the bull ends in three\r\nstalks of corn, and in one of them corn-stalks instead of blood are\r\nseen issuing from the wound inflicted by the knife. Such\r\nrepresentations certainly suggest that the bull, whose sacrifice\r\nappears to have formed a leading feature in the Mithraic ritual, was\r\nconceived, in one at least of its aspects, as an incarnation of the\r\ncorn-spirit.\r\n\r\nStill more clearly does the ox appear as a personification of the\r\ncorn-spirit in a ceremony which is observed in all the provinces and\r\ndistricts of China to welcome the approach of spring. On the first\r\nday of spring, usually on the third or fourth of February, which is\r\nalso the beginning of the Chinese New Year, the governor or prefect\r\nof the city goes in procession to the east gate of the city, and\r\nsacrifices to the Divine Husbandman, who is represented with a\r\nbull\'s head on the body of a man. A large effigy of an ox, cow, or\r\nbuffalo has been prepared for the occasion, and stands outside of\r\nthe east gate, with agricultural implements beside it. The figure is\r\nmade of differently-coloured pieces of paper pasted on a framework\r\neither by a blind man or according to the directions of a\r\nnecromancer. The colours of the paper prognosticate the character of\r\nthe coming year; if red prevails, there will be many fires; if\r\nwhite, there will be floods and rain; and so with the other colours.\r\nThe mandarins walk slowly round the ox, beating it severely at each\r\nstep with rods of various hues. It is filled with five kinds of\r\ngrain, which pour forth when the effigy is broken by the blows of\r\nthe rods. The paper fragments are then set on fire, and a scramble\r\ntakes place for the burning fragments, because the people believe\r\nthat whoever gets one of them is sure to be fortunate throughout the\r\nyear. A live buffalo is next killed, and its flesh is divided among\r\nthe mandarins. According to one account, the effigy of the ox is\r\nmade of clay, and, after being beaten by the governor, is stoned by\r\nthe people till they break it in pieces, "from which they expect an\r\nabundant year." Here the corn-spirit appears to be plainly\r\nrepresented by the corn-filled ox, whose fragments may therefore be\r\nsupposed to bring fertility with them.\r\n\r\nOn the whole we may perhaps conclude that both as a goat and as a\r\nbull Dionysus was essentially a god of vegetation. The Chinese and\r\nEuropean customs which I have cited may perhaps shed light on the\r\ncustom of rending a live bull or goat at the rites of Dionysus. The\r\nanimal was torn in fragments, as the Khond victim was cut in pieces,\r\nin order that the worshippers might each secure a portion of the\r\nlife-giving and fertilising influence of the god. The flesh was\r\neaten raw as a sacrament, and we may conjecture that some of it was\r\ntaken home to be buried in the fields, or otherwise employed so as\r\nto convey to the fruits of the earth the quickening influence of the\r\ngod of vegetation. The resurrection of Dionysus, related in his\r\nmyth, may have been enacted in his rites by stuffing and setting up\r\nthe slain ox, as was done at the Athenian _bouphonia._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Demeter, the Pig and the Horse\r\n\r\nPASSING next to the corn-goddess Demeter, and remembering that in\r\nEuropean folk-lore the pig is a common embodiment of the\r\ncorn-spirit, we may now ask whether the pig, which was so closely\r\nassociated with Demeter, may not have been originally the goddess\r\nherself in animal form. The pig was sacred to her; in art she was\r\nportrayed carrying or accompanied by a pig; and the pig was\r\nregularly sacrificed in her mysteries, the reason assigned being\r\nthat the pig injures the corn and is therefore an enemy of the\r\ngoddess. But after an animal has been conceived as a god, or a god\r\nas an animal, it sometimes happens, as we have seen, that the god\r\nsloughs off his animal form and becomes purely anthropomorphic; and\r\nthat then the animal, which at first had been slain in the character\r\nof the god, comes to be viewed as a victim offered to the god on the\r\nground of its hostility to the deity; in short, the god is\r\nsacrificed to himself on the ground that he is his own enemy. This\r\nhappened to Dionysus, and it may have happened to Demeter also. And\r\nin fact the rites of one of her festivals, the Thesmophoria, bear\r\nout the view that originally the pig was an embodiment of the\r\ncorn-goddess herself, either Demeter or her daughter and double\r\nPersephone. The Attic Thesmophoria was an autumn festival,\r\ncelebrated by women alone in October, and appears to have\r\nrepresented with mourning rites the descent of Persephone (or\r\nDemeter) into the lower world, and with joy her return from the\r\ndead. Hence the name Descent or Ascent variously applied to the\r\nfirst, and the name _Kalligeneia_ (fair-born) applied to the third\r\nday of the festival. Now it was customary at the Thesmophoria to\r\nthrow pigs, cakes of dough, and branches of pine-trees into "the\r\nchasms of Demeter and Persephone," which appear to have been sacred\r\ncaverns or vaults. In these caverns or vaults there were said to be\r\nserpents, which guarded the caverns and consumed most of the flesh\r\nof the pigs and dough-cakes which were thrown in.\r\nAfterwards--apparently at the next annual festival--the decayed\r\nremains of the pigs, the cakes, and the pine-branches were fetched\r\nby women called "drawers," who, after observing rules of ceremonial\r\npurity for three days, descended into the caverns, and, frightening\r\naway the serpents by clapping their hands, brought up the remains\r\nand placed them on the altar. Whoever got a piece of the decayed\r\nflesh and cakes, and sowed it with the seed-corn in his field, was\r\nbelieved to be sure of a good crop.\r\n\r\nTo explain the rude and ancient ritual of the Thesmophoria the\r\nfollowing legend was told. At the moment when Pluto carried off\r\nPersephone, a swineherd called Eubuleus chanced to be herding his\r\nswine on the spot, and his herd was engulfed in the chasm down which\r\nPluto vanished with Persephone. Accordingly at the Thesmophoria pigs\r\nwere annually thrown into caverns to commemorate the disappearance\r\nof the swine of Eubuleus. It follows from this that the casting of\r\nthe pigs into the vaults at the Thesmophoria formed part of the\r\ndramatic representation of Persephone\'s descent into the lower\r\nworld; and as no image of Persephone appears to have been thrown in,\r\nwe may infer that the descent of the pigs was not so much an\r\naccompaniment of her descent as the descent itself, in short, that\r\nthe pigs were Persephone. Afterwards when Persephone or Demeter (for\r\nthe two are equivalent) took on human form, a reason had to be found\r\nfor the custom of throwing pigs into caverns at her festival; and\r\nthis was done by saying that when Pluto carried off Persephone there\r\nhappened to be some swine browsing near, which were swallowed up\r\nalong with her. The story is obviously a forced and awkward attempt\r\nto bridge over the gulf between the old conception of the\r\ncorn-spirit as a pig and the new conception of her as an\r\nanthropomorphic goddess. A trace of the older conception survived in\r\nthe legend that when the sad mother was searching for traces of the\r\nvanished Persephone, the footprints of the lost one were obliterated\r\nby the footprints of a pig; originally, we may conjecture, the\r\nfootprints of the pig were the footprints of Persephone and of\r\nDemeter herself. A consciousness of the intimate connexion of the\r\npig with the corn lurks in the legend that the swineherd Eubuleus\r\nwas a brother of Triptolemus, to whom Demeter first imparted the\r\nsecret of the corn. Indeed, according to one version of the story,\r\nEubuleus himself received, jointly with his brother Triptolemus, the\r\ngift of the corn from Demeter as a reward for revealing to her the\r\nfate of Persephone. Further, it is to be noted that at the\r\nThesmophoria the women appear to have eaten swine\'s flesh. The meal,\r\nif I am right, must have been a solemn sacrament or communion, the\r\nworshippers partaking of the body of the god.\r\n\r\nAs thus explained, the Thesmophoria has its analogies in the\r\nfolk-customs of Northern Europe which have been already described.\r\nJust as at the Thesmophoria--an autumn festival in honour of the\r\ncorn-goddess--swine\'s flesh was partly eaten, partly kept in caverns\r\ntill the following year, when it was taken up to be sown with the\r\nseed-corn in the fields for the purpose of securing a good crop; so\r\nin the neighbourhood of Grenoble the goat killed on the\r\nharvest-field is partly eaten at the harvest-supper, partly pickled\r\nand kept till the next harvest; so at Pouilly the ox killed on the\r\nharvest-field is partly eaten by the harvesters, partly pickled and\r\nkept till the first day of sowing in spring, probably to be then\r\nmixed with the seed, or eaten by the ploughmen, or both; so at\r\nUdvarhely the feathers of the cock which is killed in the last sheaf\r\nat harvest are kept till spring, and then sown with the seed on the\r\nfield; so in Hesse and Meiningen the flesh of pigs is eaten on Ash\r\nWednesday or Candlemas, and the bones are kept till sowing-time,\r\nwhen they are put into the field sown or mixed with the seed in the\r\nbag; so, lastly, the corn from the last sheaf is kept till\r\nChristmas, made into the Yule Boar, and afterwards broken and mixed\r\nwith the seed-corn at sowing in spring. Thus, to put it generally,\r\nthe corn-spirit is killed in animal form in autumn; part of his\r\nflesh is eaten as a sacrament by his worshippers; and part of it is\r\nkept till next sowing-time or harvest as a pledge and security for\r\nthe continuance or renewal of the corn-spirit\'s energies.\r\n\r\nIf persons of fastidious taste should object that the Greeks never\r\ncould have conceived Demeter and Persephone to be embodied in the\r\nform of pigs, it may be answered that in the cave of Phigalia in\r\nArcadia the Black Demeter was portrayed with the head and mane of a\r\nhorse on the body of a woman. Between the portraits of a goddess as\r\na pig, and the portrait of her as a woman with a horse\'s head, there\r\nis little to choose in respect of barbarism. The legend told of the\r\nPhigalian Demeter indicates that the horse was one of the animal\r\nforms assumed in ancient Greece, as in modern Europe, by the\r\ncornspirit. It was said that in her search for her daughter, Demeter\r\nassumed the form of a mare to escape the addresses of Poseidon, and\r\nthat, offended at his importunity, she withdrew in dudgeon to a cave\r\nnot far from Phigalia in the highlands of Western Arcadia. There,\r\nrobed in black, she tarried so long that the fruits of the earth\r\nwere perishing, and mankind would have died of famine if Pan had not\r\nsoothed the angry goddess and persuaded her to quit the cave. In\r\nmemory of this event, the Phigalians set up an image of the Black\r\nDemeter in the cave; it represented a woman dressed in a long robe,\r\nwith the head and mane of a horse. The Black Demeter, in whose\r\nabsence the fruits of the earth perish, is plainly a mythical\r\nexpression for the bare wintry earth stripped of its summer mantle\r\nof green.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Attis, Adonis, and the Pig\r\n\r\nPASSING now to Attis and Adonis, we may note a few facts which seem\r\nto show that these deities of vegetation had also, like other\r\ndeities of the same class, their animal embodiments. The worshippers\r\nof Attis abstained from eating the flesh of swine. This appears to\r\nindicate that the pig was regarded as an embodiment of Attis. And\r\nthe legend that Attis was killed by a boar points in the same\r\ndirection. For after the examples of the goat Dionysus and the pig\r\nDemeter it may almost be laid down as a rule that an animal which is\r\nsaid to have injured a god was originally the god himself. Perhaps\r\nthe cry of "Hyes Attes! Hyes Attes!" which was raised by the\r\nworshippers of Attis, may be neither more nor less than "Pig Attis!\r\nPig Attis!"--_hyes_ being possibly a Phrygian form of the Greek\r\n_hy\xafs,_ "a pig."\r\n\r\nIn regard to Adonis, his connexion with the boar was not always\r\nexplained by the story that he had been killed by the animal.\r\nAccording to another story, a boar rent with his tusk the bark of\r\nthe tree in which the infant Adonis was born. According to yet\r\nanother story, he perished at the hands of Hephaestus on Mount\r\nLebanon while he was hunting wild boars. These variations in the\r\nlegend serve to show that, while the connexion of the boar with\r\nAdonis was certain, the reason of the connexion was not understood,\r\nand that consequently different stories were devised to explain it.\r\nCertainly the pig ranked as a sacred animal among the Syrians. At\r\nthe great religious metropolis of Hierapolis on the Euphrates pigs\r\nwere neither sacrificed nor eaten, and if a man touched a pig he was\r\nunclean for the rest of the day. Some people said this was because\r\nthe pigs were unclean; others said it was because the pigs were\r\nsacred. This difference of opinion points to a hazy state of\r\nreligious thought in which the ideas of sanctity and uncleanness are\r\nnot yet sharply distinguished, both being blent in a sort of\r\nvaporous solution to which we give the name of taboo. It is quite\r\nconsistent with this that the pig should have been held to be an\r\nembodiment of the divine Adonis, and the analogies of Dionysus and\r\nDemeter make it probable that the story of the hostility of the\r\nanimal to the god was only a late misapprehension of the old view of\r\nthe god as embodied in a pig. The rule that pigs were not sacrificed\r\nor eaten by worshippers of Attis and presumably of Adonis, does not\r\nexclude the possibility that in these rituals the pig was slain on\r\nsolemn occasions as a representative of the god and consumed\r\nsacramentally by the worshippers. Indeed, the sacramental killing\r\nand eating of an animal implies that the animal is sacred, and that,\r\nas a general rule, it is spared.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Jews to the pig was as ambiguous as that of the\r\nheathen Syrians towards the same animal. The Greeks could not decide\r\nwhether the Jews worshipped swine or abominated them. On the one\r\nhand they might not eat swine; but on the other hand they might not\r\nkill them. And if the former rule speaks for the uncleanness, the\r\nlatter speaks still more strongly for the sanctity of the animal.\r\nFor whereas both rules may, and one rule must, be explained on the\r\nsupposition that the pig was sacred; neither rule must, and one rule\r\ncannot, be explained on the supposition that the pig was unclean.\r\nIf, therefore, we prefer the former supposition, we must conclude\r\nthat, originally at least, the pig was revered rather than abhorred\r\nby the Israelites. We are confirmed in this opinion by observing\r\nthat down to the time of Isaiah some of the Jews used to meet\r\nsecretly in gardens to eat the flesh of swine and mice as a\r\nreligious rite. Doubtless this was a very ancient ceremony, dating\r\nfrom a time when both the pig and the mouse were venerated as\r\ndivine, and when their flesh was partaken of sacramentally on rare\r\nand solemn occasions as the body and blood of gods. And in general\r\nit may perhaps be said that all so-called unclean animals were\r\noriginally sacred; the reason for not eating them was that they were\r\ndivine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Osiris, the Pig and the Bull\r\n\r\nIN ANCIENT Egypt, within historical times, the pig occupied the same\r\ndubious position as in Syria and Palestine, though at first sight\r\nits uncleanness is more prominent than its sanctity. The Egyptians\r\nare generally said by Greek writers to have abhorred the pig as a\r\nfoul and loathsome animal. If a man so much as touched a pig in\r\npassing, he stepped into the river with all his clothes on, to wash\r\noff the taint. To drink pig\'s milk was believed to cause leprosy to\r\nthe drinker. Swineherds, though natives of Egypt, were forbidden to\r\nenter any temple, and they were the only men who were thus excluded.\r\nNo one would give his daughter in marriage to a swineherd, or marry\r\na swineherd\'s daughter; the swineherds married among themselves. Yet\r\nonce a year the Egyptians sacrificed pigs to the moon and to Osiris,\r\nand not only sacrificed them, but ate of their flesh, though on any\r\nother day of the year they would neither sacrifice them nor taste of\r\ntheir flesh. Those who were too poor to offer a pig on this day\r\nbaked cakes of dough, and offered them instead. This can hardly be\r\nexplained except by the supposition that the pig was a sacred animal\r\nwhich was eaten sacramentally by his worshippers once a year.\r\n\r\nThe view that in Egypt the pig was sacred is borne out by the very\r\nfacts which, to moderns, might seem to prove the contrary. Thus the\r\nEgyptians thought, as we have seen, that to drink pig\'s milk\r\nproduced leprosy. But exactly analogous views are held by savages\r\nabout the animals and plants which they deem most sacred. Thus in\r\nthe island of Wetar (between New Guinea and Celebes) people believe\r\nthemselves to be variously descended from wild pigs, serpents,\r\ncrocodiles, turtles, dogs, and eels; a man may not eat an animal of\r\nthe kind from which he is descended; if he does so, he will become a\r\nleper, and go mad. Amongst the Omaha Indians of North America men\r\nwhose totem is the elk, believe that if they ate the flesh of the\r\nmale elk they would break out in boils and white spots in different\r\nparts of their bodies. In the same tribe men whose totem is the red\r\nmaize, think that if they ate red maize they would have running\r\nsores all round their mouths. The Bush negroes of Surinam, who\r\npractise totemism, believe that if they ate the _capia\xef_ (an animal\r\nlike a pig) it would give them leprosy; perhaps the _capia\xef_ is one\r\nof their totems. The Syrians, in antiquity, who esteemed fish\r\nsacred, thought that if they ate fish their bodies would break out\r\nin ulcers, and their feet and stomach would swell up. The Chasas of\r\nOrissa believe that if they were to injure their totemic animal they\r\nwould be attacked by leprosy and their line would die out. These\r\nexamples prove that the eating of a sacred animal is often believed\r\nto produce leprosy or other skin-diseases; so far, therefore, they\r\nsupport the view that the pig must have been sacred in Egypt, since\r\nthe effect of drinking its milk was believed to be leprosy.\r\n\r\nAgain, the rule that, after touching a pig, a man had to wash\r\nhimself and his clothes, also favours the view of the sanctity of\r\nthe pig. For it is a common belief that the effect of contact with a\r\nsacred object must be removed, by washing or otherwise, before a man\r\nis free to mingle with his fellows. Thus the Jews wash their hands\r\nafter reading the sacred scriptures. Before coming forth from the\r\ntabernacle after the sin-offering, the high priest had to wash\r\nhimself, and put off the garments which he had worn in the holy\r\nplace. It was a rule of Greek ritual that, in offering an expiatory\r\nsacrifice, the sacrificer should not touch the sacrifice, and that,\r\nafter the offering was made, he must wash his body and his clothes\r\nin a river or spring before he could enter a city or his own house.\r\nThe Polynesians felt strongly the need of ridding themselves of the\r\nsacred contagion, if it may be so called, which they caught by\r\ntouching sacred objects. Various ceremonies were performed for the\r\npurpose of removing this contagion. We have seen, for example, how\r\nin Tonga a man who happened to touch a sacred chief, or anything\r\npersonally belonging to him, had to perform a certain ceremony\r\nbefore he could feed himself with his hands; otherwise it was\r\nbelieved that he would swell up and die, or at least be afflicted\r\nwith scrofula or some other disease. We have seen, too, what fatal\r\neffects are supposed to follow, and do actually follow, from contact\r\nwith a sacred object in New Zealand. In short, primitive man\r\nbelieves that what is sacred is dangerous; it is pervaded by a sort\r\nof electrical sanctity which communicates a shock to, even if it\r\ndoes not kill, whatever comes in contact with it. Hence the savage\r\nis unwilling to touch or even to see that which he deems peculiarly\r\nholy. Thus Bechuanas, of the Crocodile clan, think it "hateful and\r\nunlucky" to meet or see a crocodile; the sight is thought to cause\r\ninflammation of the eyes. Yet the crocodile is their most sacred\r\nobject; they call it their father, swear by it, and celebrate it in\r\ntheir festivals. The goat is the sacred animal of the Madenassana\r\nBushmen; yet "to look upon it would be to render the man for the\r\ntime impure, as well as to cause him undefined uneasiness." The Elk\r\nclan, among the Omaha Indians, believe that even to touch the male\r\nelk would be followed by an eruption of boils and white spots on the\r\nbody. Members of the Reptile clan in the same tribe think that if\r\none of them touches or smells a snake, it will make his hair white.\r\nIn Samoa people whose god was a butterfly believed that if they\r\ncaught a butterfly it would strike them dead. Again, in Samoa the\r\nreddish-seared leaves of the banana-tree were commonly used as\r\nplates for handing food; but if any member of the Wild Pigeon family\r\nhad used banana leaves for this purpose, it was supposed that he\r\nwould suffer from rheumatic swellings or an eruption all over the\r\nbody like chicken-pox. The Mori clan of the Bhils in Central India\r\nworship the peacock as their totem and make offerings of grain to\r\nit; yet members of the clan believe that were they even to set foot\r\non the tracks of a peacock they would afterwards suffer from some\r\ndisease, and if a woman sees a peacock she must veil her face and\r\nlook away. Thus the primitive mind seems to conceive of holiness as\r\na sort of dangerous virus, which a prudent man will shun as far as\r\npossible, and of which, if he should chance to be infected by it, he\r\nwill carefully disinfect himself by some form of ceremonial\r\npurification.\r\n\r\nIn the light of these parallels the beliefs and customs of the\r\nEgyptians touching the pig are probably to be explained as based\r\nupon an opinion of the extreme sanctity rather than of the extreme\r\nuncleanness of the animal; or rather, to put it more correctly, they\r\nimply that the animal was looked on, not simply as a filthy and\r\ndisgusting creature, but as a being endowed with high supernatural\r\npowers, and that as such it was regarded with that primitive\r\nsentiment of religious awe and fear in which the feelings of\r\nreverence and abhorrence are almost equally blended. The ancients\r\nthemselves seem to have been aware that there was another side to\r\nthe horror with which swine seemed to inspire the Egyptians. For the\r\nGreek astronomer and mathematician Eudoxus, who resided fourteen\r\nmonths in Egypt and conversed with the priests, was of opinion that\r\nthe Egyptians spared the pig, not out of abhorrence, but from a\r\nregard to its utility in agriculture; for, according to him, when\r\nthe Nile had subsided, herds of swine were turned loose over the\r\nfields to tread the seed down into the moist earth. But when a being\r\nis thus the object of mixed and implicitly contradictory feelings,\r\nhe may be said to occupy a position of unstable equilibrium. In\r\ncourse of time one of the contradictory feelings is likely to\r\nprevail over the other, and according as the feeling which finally\r\npredominates is that of reverence or abhorrence, the being who is\r\nthe object of it will rise into a god or sink into a devil. The\r\nlatter, on the whole, was the fate of the pig in Egypt. For in\r\nhistorical times the fear and horror of the pig seem certainly to\r\nhave outweighed the reverence and worship of which he may once have\r\nbeen the object, and of which, even in his fallen state, he never\r\nquite lost trace. He came to be looked on as an embodiment of Set or\r\nTyphon, the Egyptian devil and enemy of Osiris. For it was in the\r\nshape of a black pig that Typhon injured the eye of the god Horus,\r\nwho burned him and instituted the sacrifice of the pig, the sun-god\r\nRa having declared the beast abominable. Again, the story that\r\nTyphon was hunting a boar when he discovered and mangled the body of\r\nOsiris, and that this was the reason why pigs were sacrificed once a\r\nyear, is clearly a modernised version of an older story that Osiris,\r\nlike Adonis and Attis, was slain or mangled by a boar, or by Typhon\r\nin the form of a boar. Thus, the annual sacrifice of a pig to Osiris\r\nmight naturally be interpreted as vengeance inflicted on the hostile\r\nanimal that had slain or mangled the god. But, in the first place,\r\nwhen an animal is thus killed as a solemn sacrifice once and once\r\nonly in the year, it generally or always means that the animal is\r\ndivine, that he is spared and respected the rest of the year as a\r\ngod and slain, when he is slain, also in the character of a god. In\r\nthe second place, the examples of Dionysus and Demeter, if not of\r\nAttis and Adonis, have taught us that the animal which is sacrificed\r\nto a god on the ground that he is the god\'s enemy may have been, and\r\nprobably was, originally the god himself. Therefore, the annual\r\nsacrifice of a pig to Osiris, coupled with the alleged hostility of\r\nthe animal to the god, tends to show, first, that originally the pig\r\nwas a god, and, second, that he was Osiris. At a later age, when\r\nOsiris became anthropomorphic and his original relation to the pig\r\nhad been forgotten, the animal was first distinguished from him, and\r\nafterwards opposed as an enemy to him by mythologists who could\r\nthink of no reason for killing a beast in connexion with the worship\r\nof a god except that the beast was the god\'s enemy; or, as Plutarch\r\nputs it, not that which is dear to the gods, but that which is the\r\ncontrary, is fit to be sacrificed. At this later stage the havoc\r\nwhich a wild boar notoriously makes amongst the corn would supply a\r\nplausible reason for regarding him as the foe of the corn-spirit,\r\nthough originally, if I am right, the very freedom with which the\r\nboar ranged at will through the corn led people to identify him with\r\nthe corn-spirit, to whom he was afterwards opposed as an enemy.\r\n\r\nThe view which identifies the pig with Osiris derives not a little\r\nsupport from the sacrifice of pigs to him on the very day on which,\r\naccording to tradition, Osiris himself was killed; for thus the\r\nkilling of the pig was the annual representation of the killing of\r\nOsiris, just as the throwing of the pigs into the caverns at the\r\nThesmophoria was an annual representation of the descent of\r\nPersephone into the lower world; and both customs are parallel to\r\nthe European practice of killing a goat, cock, and so forth, at\r\nharvest as a representative of the corn-spirit.\r\n\r\nAgain, the theory that the pig, originally Osiris himself,\r\nafterwards came to be regarded as an embodiment of his enemy Typhon,\r\nis supported by the similar relation of red-haired men and red oxen\r\nto Typhon. For in regard to the red-haired men who were burned and\r\nwhose ashes were scattered with winnowing-fans, we have seen fair\r\ngrounds for believing that originally, like the red-haired puppies\r\nkilled at Rome in spring, they were representatives of the\r\ncorn-spirit himself that is, of Osiris, and were slain for the\r\nexpress purpose of making the corn turn red or golden. Yet at a\r\nlater time these men were explained to be representatives, not of\r\nOsiris, but of his enemy Typhon, and the killing of them was\r\nregarded as an act of vengeance inflicted on the enemy of the god.\r\nSimilarly, the red oxen sacrificed by the Egyptians were said to be\r\noffered on the ground of their resemblance to Typhon; though it is\r\nmore likely that originally they were slain on the ground of their\r\nresemblance to the corn-spirit Osiris. We have seen that the ox is a\r\ncommon representative of the corn-spirit and is slain as such on the\r\nharvest-field.\r\n\r\nOsiris was regularly identified with the bull Apis of Memphis and\r\nthe bull Mnevis of Heliopolis. But it is hard to say whether these\r\nbulls were embodiments of him as the corn-spirit, as the red oxen\r\nappear to have been, or whether they were not in origin entirely\r\ndistinct deities who came to be fused with Osiris at a later time.\r\nThe universality of the worship of these two bulls seems to put them\r\non a different footing from the ordinary sacred animals whose\r\nworships were purely local. But whatever the original relation of\r\nApis to Osiris may have been, there is one fact about the former\r\nwhich ought not to be passed over in a disquisition on the custom of\r\nkilling a god. Although the bull Apis was worshipped as a god with\r\nmuch pomp and profound reverence, he was not suffered to live beyond\r\na certain length of time which was prescribed by the sacred books,\r\nand on the expiry of which he was drowned in a holy spring. The\r\nlimit, according to Plutarch, was twenty-five years; but it cannot\r\nalways have been enforced, for the tombs of the Apis bulls have been\r\ndiscovered in modern times, and from the inscriptions on them it\r\nappears that in the twenty-second dynasty two of the holy steers\r\nlived more than twenty-six years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Virbius and the Horse\r\n\r\nWE are now in a position to hazard a conjecture as to the meaning of\r\nthe tradition that Virbius, the first of the divine Kings of the\r\nWood at Aricia, had been killed in the character of Hippolytus by\r\nhorses. Having found, first, that spirits of the corn are not\r\ninfrequently represented in the form of horses; and, second, that\r\nthe animal which in later legends is said to have injured the god\r\nwas sometimes originally the god himself, we may conjecture that the\r\nhorses by which Virbius or Hippolytus was said to have been slain\r\nwere really embodiments of him as a deity of vegetation. The myth\r\nthat he had been killed by horses was probably invented to explain\r\ncertain features in his worship, amongst others the custom of\r\nexcluding horses from his sacred grove. For myth changes while\r\ncustom remains constant; men continue to do what their fathers did\r\nbefore them, though the reasons on which their fathers acted have\r\nbeen long forgotten. The history of religion is a long attempt to\r\nreconcile old custom with new reason, to find a sound theory for an\r\nabsurd practice. In the case before us we may be sure that the myth\r\nis more modern than the custom and by no means represents the\r\noriginal reason for excluding horses from the grove. From their\r\nexclusion it might be inferred that horses could not be the sacred\r\nanimals or embodiments of the god of the grove. But the inference\r\nwould be rash. The goat was at one time a sacred animal or\r\nembodiment of Athena, as may be inferred from the practice of\r\nrepresenting the goddess clad in a goat-skin (_aegis_). Yet the goat\r\nwas neither sacrificed to her as a rule, nor allowed to enter her\r\ngreat sanctuary, the Acropolis at Athens. The reason alleged for\r\nthis was that the goat injured the olive, the sacred tree of Athena.\r\nSo far, therefore, the relation of the goat to Athena is parallel to\r\nthe relation of the horse to Virbius, both animals being excluded\r\nfrom the sanctuary on the ground of injury done by them to the god.\r\nBut from Varro we learn that there was an exception to the rule\r\nwhich excluded the goat from the Acropolis. Once a year, he says,\r\nthe goat was driven on to the Acropolis for a necessary sacrifice.\r\nNow, as has been remarked before, when an animal is sacrificed once\r\nand once only in the year, it is probably slain, not as a victim\r\noffered to the god, but as a representative of the god himself.\r\nTherefore we may infer that if a goat was sacrificed on the\r\nAcropolis once a year, it was sacrificed in the character of Athena\r\nherself; and it may be conjectured that the skin of the sacrificed\r\nanimal was placed on the statue of the goddess and formed the\r\n_aegis,_ which would thus be renewed annually. Similarly at Thebes\r\nin Egypt rams were sacred and were not sacrificed. But on one day in\r\nthe year a ram was killed, and its skin was placed on the statue of\r\nthe god Ammon. Now, if we knew the ritual of the Arician grove\r\nbetter, we might find that the rule of excluding horses from it,\r\nlike the rule of excluding goats from the Acropolis at Athens, was\r\nsubject to an annual exception, a horse being once a year taken into\r\nthe grove and sacrificed as an embodiment of the god Virbius. By the\r\nusual misunderstanding the horse thus killed would come in time to\r\nbe regarded as an enemy offered up in sacrifice to the god whom he\r\nhad injured, like the pig which was sacrificed to Demeter and Osiris\r\nor the goat which was sacrificed to Dionysus, and possibly to\r\nAthena. It is so easy for a writer to record a rule without noticing\r\nan exception that we need not wonder at finding the rule of the\r\nArician grove recorded without any mention of an exception such as I\r\nsuppose. If we had had only the statements of Athenaeus and Pliny,\r\nwe should have known only the rule which forbade the sacrifice of\r\ngoats to Athena and excluded them from the Acropolis, without being\r\naware of the important exception which the fortunate preservation of\r\nVarro\'s work has revealed to us.\r\n\r\nThe conjecture that once a year a horse may have been sacrificed in\r\nthe Arician grove as a representative of the deity of the grove\r\nderives some support from the similar sacrifice of a horse which\r\ntook place once a year at Rome. On the fifteenth of October in each\r\nyear a chariot-race was run on the Field of Mars. Stabbed with a\r\nspear, the right-hand horse of the victorious team was then\r\nsacrificed to Mars for the purpose of ensuring good crops, and its\r\nhead was cut off and adorned with a string of loaves. Thereupon the\r\ninhabitants of two wards--the Sacred Way and the Subura--contended\r\nwith each other who should get the head. If the people of the Sacred\r\nWay got it, they fastened it to a wall of the king\'s house; if the\r\npeople of the Subura got it, they fastened it to the Mamilian tower.\r\nThe horse\'s tail was cut off and carried to the king\'s house with\r\nsuch speed that the blood dripped on the hearth of the house.\r\nFurther, it appears that the blood of the horse was caught and\r\npreserved till the twenty-first of April, when the Vestal Virgins\r\nmixed it with the blood of the unborn calves which had been\r\nsacrificed six days before. The mixture was then distributed to\r\nshepherds, and used by them for fumigating their flocks.\r\n\r\nIn this ceremony the decoration of the horse\'s head with a string of\r\nloaves, and the alleged object of the sacrifice, namely, to procure\r\na good harvest, seem to indicate that the horse was killed as one of\r\nthose animal representatives of the corn-spirit of which we have\r\nfound so many examples. The custom of cutting off the horse\'s tail\r\nis like the African custom of cutting off the tails of the oxen and\r\nsacrificing them to obtain a good crop. In both the Roman and the\r\nAfrican custom the animal apparently stands for the corn-spirit, and\r\nits fructifying power is supposed to reside especially in its tail.\r\nThe latter idea occurs, as we have seen, in European folk-lore.\r\nAgain, the practice of fumigating the cattle in spring with the\r\nblood of the horse may be compared with the practice of giving the\r\nOld Wife, the Maiden, or the _clyack_ sheaf as fodder to the horses\r\nin spring or the cattle at Christmas, and giving the Yule Boar to\r\nthe ploughing oxen or horses to eat in spring. All these usages aim\r\nat ensuring the blessing of the corn-spirit on the homestead and its\r\ninmates and storing it up for another year.\r\n\r\nThe Roman sacrifice of the October horse, as it was called, carries\r\nus back to the early days when the Subura, afterwards a low and\r\nsqualid quarter of the great metropolis, was still a separate\r\nvillage, whose inhabitants engaged in a friendly contest on the\r\nharvest-field with their neighbours of Rome, then a little rural\r\ntown. The Field of Mars on which the ceremony took place lay beside\r\nthe Tiber, and formed part of the king\'s domain down to the\r\nabolition of the monarchy. For tradition ran that at the time when\r\nthe last of the kings was driven from Rome, the corn stood ripe for\r\nthe sickle on the crown lands beside the river; but no one would eat\r\nthe accursed grain and it was flung into the river in such heaps\r\nthat, the water being low with the summer heat, it formed the\r\nnucleus of an island. The horse sacrifice was thus an old autumn\r\ncustom observed upon the king\'s corn-fields at the end of the\r\nharvest. The tail and blood of the horse, as the chief parts of the\r\ncorn-spirit\'s representative, were taken to the king\'s house and\r\nkept there; just as in Germany the harvest-cock is nailed on the\r\ngable or over the door of the farmhouse; and as the last sheaf, in\r\nthe form of the Maiden, is carried home and kept over the fireplace\r\nin the Highlands of Scotland. Thus the blessing of the corn-spirit\r\nwas brought to the king\'s house and hearth and, through them, to the\r\ncommunity of which he was the head. Similarly in the spring and\r\nautumn customs of Northern Europe the May-pole is sometimes set up\r\nin front of the house of the mayor or burgomaster, and the last\r\nsheaf at harvest is brought to him as the head of the village. But\r\nwhile the tail and blood fell to the king, the neighbouring village\r\nof the Subura, which no doubt once had a similar ceremony of its\r\nown, was gratified by being allowed to compete for the prize of the\r\nhorse\'s head. The Mamilian tower, to which the Suburans nailed the\r\nhorse\'s head when they succeeded in carrying it off, appears to have\r\nbeen a peel-tower or keep of the old Mamilian family, the magnates\r\nof the village. The ceremony thus performed on the king\'s fields and\r\nat his house on behalf of the whole town and of the neighbouring\r\nvillage presupposes a time when each township performed a similar\r\nceremony on its own fields. In the rural districts of Latium the\r\nvillages may have continued to observe the custom, each on its own\r\nland, long after the Roman hamlets had merged their separate\r\nharvest-homes in the common celebration on the king\'s lands. There\r\nis no intrinsic improbability in the supposition that the sacred\r\ngrove of Aricia, like the Field of Mars at Rome, may have been the\r\nscene of a common harvest celebration, at which a horse was\r\nsacrificed with the same rude rites on behalf of the neighbouring\r\nvillages. The horse would represent the fructifying spirit both of\r\nthe tree and of the corn, for the two ideas melt into each other, as\r\nwe see in customs like the Harvest-May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL. Eating the God\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Sacrament of First-Fruits\r\n\r\nWE have now seen that the corn-spirit is represented sometimes in\r\nhuman, sometimes in animal form, and that in both cases he is killed\r\nin the person of his representative and eaten sacramentally. To find\r\nexamples of actually killing the human representative of the\r\ncorn-spirit we had naturally to go to savage races; but the\r\nharvest-suppers of our European peasants have furnished unmistakable\r\nexamples of the sacramental eating of animals as representatives of\r\nthe corn-spirit. But further, as might have been anticipated, the\r\nnew corn is itself eaten sacramentally, that is, as the body of the\r\ncorn-spirit. In Wermland, Sweden, the farmer\'s wife uses the grain\r\nof the last sheaf to bake a loaf in the shape of a little girl; this\r\nloaf is divided amongst the whole household and eaten by them. Here\r\nthe loaf represents the corn-spirit conceived as a maiden; just as\r\nin Scotland the corn-spirit is similarly conceived and represented\r\nby the last sheaf made up in the form of a woman and bearing the\r\nname of the Maiden. As usual, the corn-spirit is believed to reside\r\nin the last sheaf; and to eat a loaf made from the last sheaf is,\r\ntherefore, to eat the corn-spirit itself. Similarly at La Palisse,\r\nin France, a man made of dough is hung upon the fir-tree which is\r\ncarried on the last harvest-waggon. The tree and the dough-man are\r\ntaken to the mayor\'s house and kept there till the vintage is over.\r\nThen the close of the harvest is celebrated by a feast at which the\r\nmayor breaks the dough-man in pieces and gives the pieces to the\r\npeople to eat.\r\n\r\nIn these examples the corn-spirit is represented and eaten in human\r\nshape. In other cases, though the new corn is not baked in loaves of\r\nhuman shape, still the solemn ceremonies with which it is eaten\r\nsuffice to indicate that it is partaken of sacramentally, that is,\r\nas the body of the corn-spirit. For example, the following\r\nceremonies used to be observed by Lithuanian peasants at eating the\r\nnew corn. About the time of the autumn sowing, when all the corn had\r\nbeen got in and the threshing had begun, each farmer held a festival\r\ncalled Sabarios, that is, "the mixing or throwing together." He took\r\nnine good handfuls of each kind of crop--wheat, barley, oats, flax,\r\nbeans, lentils, and the rest; and each handful he divided into three\r\nparts. The twentyseven portions of each grain were then thrown on a\r\nheap and all mixed up together. The grain used had to be that which\r\nwas first threshed and winnowed and which had been set aside and\r\nkept for this purpose. A part of the grain thus mixed was employed\r\nto bake little loaves, one for each of the household; the rest was\r\nmixed with more barley or oats and made into beer. The first beer\r\nbrewed from this mixture was for the drinking of the farmer, his\r\nwife, and children; the second brew was for the servants. The beer\r\nbeing ready, the farmer chose an evening when no stranger was\r\nexpected. Then he knelt down before the barrel of beer, drew a\r\njugful of the liquor and poured it on the bung of the barrel,\r\nsaying, "O fruitful earth, make rye and barley and all kinds of corn\r\nto flourish." Next he took the jug to the parlour, where his wife\r\nand children awaited him. On the floor of the parlour lay bound a\r\nblack or white or speckled (not a red) cock and a hen of the same\r\ncolour and of the same brood, which must have been hatched within\r\nthe year. Then the farmer knelt down, with the jug in his hand, and\r\nthanked God for the harvest and prayed for a good crop next year.\r\nNext all lifted up their hands and said, "O God, and thou, O earth,\r\nwe give you this cock and hen as a free-will offering." With that\r\nthe farmer killed the fowls with the blows of a wooden spoon, for he\r\nmight not cut their heads off. After the first prayer and after\r\nkilling each of the birds he poured out a third of the beer. Then\r\nhis wife boiled the fowls in a new pot which had never been used\r\nbefore. After that, a bushel was set, bottom upwards, on the floor,\r\nand on it were placed the little loaves mentioned above and the\r\nboiled fowls. Next the new beer was fetched, together with a ladle\r\nand three mugs, none of which was used except on this occasion. When\r\nthe farmer had ladled the beer into the mugs, the family knelt down\r\nround the bushel. The father then uttered a prayer and drank off the\r\nthree mugs of beer. The rest followed his example. Then the loaves\r\nand the flesh of the fowls were eaten, after which the beer went\r\nround again, till every one had emptied each of the three mugs nine\r\ntimes. None of the food should remain over; but if anything did\r\nhappen to be left, it was consumed next morning with the same\r\nceremonies. The bones were given to the dog to eat; if he did not\r\neat them all up, the remains were buried under the dung in the\r\ncattle-stall. This ceremony was observed at the beginning of\r\nDecember. On the day on which it took place no bad word might be\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\nSuch was the custom about two hundred years or more ago. At the\r\npresent day in Lithuania, when new potatoes or loaves made from the\r\nnew corn are being eaten, all the people at table pull each other\'s\r\nhair. The meaning of this last custom is obscure, but a similar\r\ncustom was certainly observed by the heathen Lithuanians at their\r\nsolemn sacrifices. Many of the Esthonians of the island of Oesel\r\nwill not eat bread baked of the new corn till they have first taken\r\na bite at a piece of iron. The iron is here plainly a charm,\r\nintended to render harmless the spirit that is in the corn. In\r\nSutherlandshire at the present day, when the new potatoes are dug\r\nall the family must taste them, otherwise "the spirits in them [the\r\npotatoes] take offence, and the potatoes would not keep." In one\r\npart of Yorkshire it is still customary for the clergyman to cut the\r\nfirst corn; and my informant believes that the corn so cut is used\r\nto make the communion bread. If the latter part of the custom is\r\ncorrectly reported (and analogy is all in its favour), it shows how\r\nthe Christian communion has absorbed within itself a sacrament which\r\nis doubtless far older than Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe Aino or Ainu of Japan are said to distinguish various kinds of\r\nmillet as male and female respectively, and these kinds, taken\r\ntogether, are called "the divine husband and wife cereal" (_Umurek\r\nharu kamui_). "Therefore before millet is pounded and made into\r\ncakes for general eating, the old men have a few made for themselves\r\nfirst to worship. When they are ready they pray to them very\r\nearnestly and say: \'O thou cereal deity, we worship thee. Thou hast\r\ngrown very well this year, and thy flavour will be sweet. Thou art\r\ngood. The goddess of fire will be glad, and we also shall rejoice\r\ngreatly. O thou god, O thou divine cereal, do thou nourish the\r\npeople. I now partake of thee. I worship thee and give thee thanks.\'\r\nAfter having thus prayed, they, the worshippers, take a cake and eat\r\nit, and from this time the people may all partake of the new millet.\r\nAnd so with many gestures of homage and words of prayer this kind of\r\nfood is dedicated to the well-being of the Ainu. No doubt the cereal\r\noffering is regarded as a tribute paid to a god, but that god is no\r\nother than the seed itself; and it is only a god in so far as it is\r\nbeneficial to the human body."\r\n\r\nAt the close of the rice harvest in the East Indian island of Buru,\r\neach clan meets at a common sacramental meal, to which every member\r\nof the clan is bound to contribute a little of the new rice. This\r\nmeal is called "eating the soul of the rice," a name which clearly\r\nindicates the sacramental character of the repast. Some of the rice\r\nis also set apart and offered to the spirits. Amongst the Alfoors of\r\nMinahassa, in Celebes, the priest sows the first rice-seed and\r\nplucks the first ripe rice in each field. This rice he roasts and\r\ngrinds into meal, and gives some of it to each of the household.\r\nShortly before the rice-harvest in Boland Mongondo, another district\r\nof Celebes, an offering is made of a small pig or a fowl. Then the\r\npriest plucks a little rice, first on his own field and next on\r\nthose of his neighbours. All the rice thus plucked by him he dries\r\nalong with his own, and then gives it back to the respective owners,\r\nwho have it ground and boiled. When it is boiled the women take it\r\nback, with an egg, to the priest, who offers the egg in sacrifice\r\nand returns the rice to the women. Of this rice every member of the\r\nfamily, down to the youngest child, must partake. After this\r\nceremony every one is free to get in his rice.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Burghers or Badagas, a tribe of the Neilgherry Hills in\r\nSouthern India, the first handful of seed is sown and the first\r\nsheaf reaped by a Curumbar, a man of a different tribe, the members\r\nof which the Burghers regard as sorcerers. The grain contained in\r\nthe first sheaf "is that day reduced to meal, made into cakes, and,\r\nbeing offered as a first-fruit oblation, is, together with the\r\nremainder of the sacrificed animal, partaken of by the Burgher and\r\nthe whole of his family, as the meat of a federal offering and\r\nsacrifice." Among the Hindoos of Southern India the eating of the\r\nnew rice is the occasion of a family festival called Pongol. The new\r\nrice is boiled in a new pot on a fire which is kindled at noon on\r\nthe day when, according to Hindoo astrologers, the sun enters the\r\ntropic of Capricorn. The boiling of the pot is watched with great\r\nanxiety by the whole family, for as the milk boils, so will the\r\ncoming year be. If the milk boils rapidly, the year will be\r\nprosperous; but it will be the reverse if the milk boils slowly.\r\nSome of the new boiled rice is offered to the image of Ganesa; then\r\nevery one partakes of it. In some parts of Northern India the\r\nfestival of the new crop is known as _Navan,_ that is, "new grain."\r\nWhen the crop is ripe, the owner takes the omens, goes to the field,\r\nplucks five or six ears of barley in the spring crop and one of the\r\nmillets in the autumn harvest. This is brought home, parched, and\r\nmixed with coarse sugar, butter, and curds. Some of it is thrown on\r\nthe fire in the name of the village gods and deceased ancestors; the\r\nrest is eaten by the family.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of eating the new yams at Onitsha, on the Niger, is\r\nthus described: "Each headman brought out six yams, and cut down\r\nyoung branches of palm-leaves and placed them before his gate,\r\nroasted three of the yams, and got some kola-nuts and fish. After\r\nthe yam is roasted, the _Libia,_ or country doctor, takes the yam,\r\nscrapes it into a sort of meal, and divides it into halves; he then\r\ntakes one piece, and places it on the lips of the person who is\r\ngoing to eat the new yam. The eater then blows up the steam from the\r\nhot yam, and afterwards pokes the whole into his mouth, and says, \'I\r\nthank God for being permitted to eat the new yam\'; he then begins to\r\nchew it heartily, with fish likewise."\r\n\r\nAmong the Nandi of British East Africa, when the eleusine grain is\r\nripening in autumn, every woman who owns a corn-field goes out into\r\nit with her daughters, and they all pluck some of the ripe grain.\r\nEach of the women then fixes one grain in her necklace and chews\r\nanother, which she rubs on her forehead, throat, and breast. No mark\r\nof joy escapes them; sorrowfully they cut a basketful of the new\r\ncorn, and carrying it home place it in the loft to dry. As the\r\nceiling is of wickerwork, a good deal of the grain drops through the\r\ncrevices and falls into the fire, where it explodes with a crackling\r\nnoise. The people make no attempt to prevent this waste; for they\r\nregard the crackling of the grain in the fire as a sign that the\r\nsouls of the dead are partaking of it. A few days later porridge is\r\nmade from the new grain and served up with milk at the evening meal.\r\nAll the members of the family take some of the porridge and dab it\r\non the walls and roofs of the huts; also they put a little in their\r\nmouths and spit it out towards the east and on the outside of the\r\nhuts. Then, holding up some of the grain in his hand, the head of\r\nthe family prays to God for health and strength, and likewise for\r\nmilk, and everybody present repeats the words of the prayer after\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Caffres of Natal and Zululand, no one may eat of the new\r\nfruits till after a festival which marks the beginning of the Caffre\r\nyear and falls at the end of December or the beginning of January.\r\nAll the people assemble at the king\'s kraal, where they feast and\r\ndance. Before they separate the "dedication of the people" takes\r\nplace. Various fruits of the earth, as corn, mealies, and pumpkins,\r\nmixed with the flesh of a sacrificed animal and with "medicine," are\r\nboiled in great pots, and a little of this food is placed in each\r\nman\'s mouth by the king himself. After thus partaking of the\r\nsanctified fruits, a man is himself sanctified for the whole year,\r\nand may immediately get in his crops. It is believed that if any man\r\nwere to partake of the new fruits before the festival, he would die;\r\nif he were detected, he would be put to death, or at least all his\r\ncattle would be taken from him. The holiness of the new fruits is\r\nwell marked by the rule that they must be cooked in a special pot\r\nwhich is used only for this purpose, and on a new fire kindled by a\r\nmagician through the friction of two sticks which are called\r\n"husband and wife."\r\n\r\nAmong the Bechuanas it is a rule that before they partake of the new\r\ncrops they must purify themselves. The purification takes place at\r\nthe commencement of the new year on a day in January which is fixed\r\nby the chief. It begins in the great kraal of the tribe, where all\r\nthe adult males assemble. Each of them takes in his hand leaves of a\r\ngourd called by the natives _lerotse_ (described as something\r\nbetween a pumpkin and a vegetable marrow); and having crushed the\r\nleaves he anoints with the expressed juice his big toes and his\r\nnavel; many people indeed apply the juice to all the joints of their\r\nbody, but the better-informed say that this is a vulgar departure\r\nfrom ancient custom. After this ceremony in the great kraal every\r\nman goes home to his own kraal, assembles all the members of his\r\nfamily, men, women, and children, and smears them all with the juice\r\nof the _lerotse_ leaves. Some of the leaves are also pounded, mixed\r\nwith milk in a large wooden dish, and given to the dogs to lap up.\r\nThen the porridge plate of each member of the family is rubbed with\r\nthe _lerotse_ leaves. When this purification has been completed, but\r\nnot before, the people are free to eat of the new crops.\r\n\r\nThe Bororo Indians of Brazil think that it would be certain death to\r\neat the new maize before it has been blessed by the medicine-man.\r\nThe ceremony of blessing it is as follows. The half-ripe husk is\r\nwashed and placed before the medicine-man, who by dancing and\r\nsinging for several hours, and by incessant smoking, works himself\r\nup into a state of ecstasy, whereupon he bites into the husk,\r\ntrembling in every limb and uttering shrieks from time to time. A\r\nsimilar ceremony is performed whenever a large animal or a large\r\nfish is killed. The Bororo are firmly persuaded that were any man to\r\ntouch unconsecrated maize or meat, before the ceremony had been\r\ncompleted, he and his whole tribe would perish.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Creek Indians of North America, the _busk_ or festival\r\nof first-fruits was the chief ceremony of the year. It was held in\r\nJuly or August, when the corn was ripe, and marked the end of the\r\nold year and the beginning of the new one. Before it took place,\r\nnone of the Indians would eat or even handle any part of the new\r\nharvest. Sometimes each town had its own busk; sometimes several\r\ntowns united to hold one in common. Before celebrating the busk, the\r\npeople provided themselves with new clothes and new household\r\nutensils and furniture; they collected their old clothes and\r\nrubbish, together with all the remaining grain and other old\r\nprovisions, cast them together in one common heap, and consumed them\r\nwith fire. As a preparation for the ceremony, all the fires in the\r\nvillage were extinguished, and the ashes swept clean away. In\r\nparticular, the hearth or altar of the temple was dug up and the\r\nashes carried out. Then the chief priest put some roots of the\r\nbutton-snake plant, with some green tobacco leaves and a little of\r\nthe new fruits, at the bottom of the fireplace, which he afterwards\r\ncommanded to be covered up with white clay, and wetted over with\r\nclean water. A thick arbour of green branches of young trees was\r\nthen made over the altar. Meanwhile the women at home were cleaning\r\nout their houses, renewing the old hearths, and scouring all the\r\ncooking vessels that they might be ready to receive the new fire and\r\nthe new fruits. The public or sacred square was carefully swept of\r\neven the smallest crumbs of previous feasts, "for fear of polluting\r\nthe first-fruit offerings." Also every vessel that had contained or\r\nhad been used about any food during the expiring year was removed\r\nfrom the temple before sunset. Then all the men who were not known\r\nto have violated the law of the first-fruit offering and that of\r\nmarriage during the year were summoned by a crier to enter the holy\r\nsquare and observe a solemn fast. But the women (except six old\r\nones), the children, and all who had not attained the rank of\r\nwarriors were forbidden to enter the square. Sentinels were also\r\nposted at the corners of the square to keep out all persons deemed\r\nimpure and all animals. A strict fast was then observed for two\r\nnights and a day, the devotees drinking a bitter decoction of\r\nbutton-snake root "in order to vomit and purge their sinful bodies."\r\nThat the people outside the square might also be purified, one of\r\nthe old men laid down a quantity of green tobacco at a corner of the\r\nsquare; this was carried off by an old woman and distributed to the\r\npeople without, who chewed and swallowed it "in order to afflict\r\ntheir souls." During this general fast, the women, children, and men\r\nof weak constitution were allowed to eat after mid-day, but not\r\nbefore. On the morning when the fast ended, the women brought a\r\nquantity of the old year\'s food to the outside of the sacred square.\r\nThese provisions were then fetched in and set before the famished\r\nmultitude, but all traces of them had to be removed before noon.\r\nWhen the sun was declining from the meridian, all the people were\r\ncommanded by the voice of a crier to stay within doors, to do no bad\r\nact, and to be sure to extinguish and throw away every spark of the\r\nold fire. Universal silence now reigned. Then the high priest made\r\nthe new fire by the friction of two pieces of wood, and placed it on\r\nthe altar under the green arbour. This new fire was believed to\r\natone for all past crimes except murder. Next a basket of new fruits\r\nwas brought; the high priest took out a little of each sort of\r\nfruit, rubbed it with bear\'s oil, and offered it, together with some\r\nflesh, "to the bountiful holy spirit of fire, as a first-fruit\r\noffering, and an annual oblation for sin." He also consecrated the\r\nsacred emetics (the button-snake root and the cassina or\r\nblack-drink) by pouring a little of them into the fire. The persons\r\nwho had remained outside now approached, without entering, the\r\nsacred square; and the chief priest thereupon made a speech,\r\nexhorting the people to observe their old rites and customs,\r\nannouncing that the new divine fire had purged away the sins of the\r\npast year, and earnestly warning the women that, if any of them had\r\nnot extinguished the old fire, or had contracted any impurity, they\r\nmust forthwith depart, "lest the divine fire should spoil both them\r\nand the people." Some of the new fire was then set down outside the\r\nholy square; the women carried it home joyfully, and laid it on\r\ntheir unpolluted hearths. When several towns had united to celebrate\r\nthe festival, the new fire might thus be carried for several miles.\r\nThe new fruits were then dressed on the new fires and eaten with\r\nbear\'s oil, which was deemed indispensable. At one point of the\r\nfestival the men rubbed the new corn between their hands, then on\r\ntheir faces and breasts. During the festival which followed, the\r\nwarriors, dressed in their wild martial array, their heads covered\r\nwith white down and carrying white feathers in their hands, danced\r\nround the sacred arbour, under which burned the new fire. The\r\nceremonies lasted eight days, during which the strictest continence\r\nwas practised. Towards the conclusion of the festival the warriors\r\nfought a mock battle; then the men and women together, in three\r\ncircles, danced round the sacred fire. Lastly, all the people\r\nsmeared themselves with white clay and bathed in running water. They\r\ncame out of the water believing that no evil could now befall them\r\nfor what they had done amiss in the past. So they departed in joy\r\nand peace.\r\n\r\nTo this day, also, the remnant of the Seminole Indians of Florida, a\r\npeople of the same stock as the Creeks, hold an annual purification\r\nand festival called the Green Corn Dance, at which the new corn is\r\neaten. On the evening of the first day of the festival they quaff a\r\nnauseous "Black Drink," as it is called, which acts both as an\r\nemetic and a purgative; they believe that he who does not drink of\r\nthis liquor cannot safely eat the new green corn, and besides that\r\nhe will be sick at some time in the year. While the liquor is being\r\ndrunk, the dancing begins, and the medicine-men join in it. Next day\r\nthey eat of the green corn; the following day they fast, probably\r\nfrom fear of polluting the sacred food in their stomachs by contact\r\nwith common food; but the third day they hold a great feast.\r\n\r\nEven tribes which do not till the ground sometimes observe analogous\r\nceremonies when they gather the first wild fruits or dig the first\r\nroots of the season. Thus among the Salish and Tinneh Indians of\r\nNorth-West America, "before the young people eat the first berries\r\nor roots of the season, they always addressed the fruit or plant,\r\nand begged for its favour and aid. In some tribes regular\r\nFirst-fruit ceremonies were annually held at the time of picking the\r\nwild fruit or gathering the roots, and also among the salmon-eating\r\ntribes when the run of the \'sockeye\' salmon began. These ceremonies\r\nwere not so much thanksgivings, as performances to ensure a\r\nplentiful crop or supply of the particular object desired, for if\r\nthey were not properly and reverently carried out there was danger\r\nof giving offence to the \'spirits\' of the objects, and being\r\ndeprived of them." For example, these Indians are fond of the young\r\nshoots or suckers of the wild raspberry, and they observe a solemn\r\nceremony at eating the first of them in season. The shoots are\r\ncooked in a new pot: the people assemble and stand in a great circle\r\nwith closed eyes, while the presiding chief or medicine-man invokes\r\nthe spirit of the plant, begging that it will be propitious to them\r\nand grant them a good supply of suckers. After this part of the\r\nceremony is over the cooked suckers are handed to the presiding\r\nofficer in a newly carved dish, and a small portion is given to each\r\nperson present, who reverently and decorously eats it.\r\n\r\nThe Thompson Indians of British Columbia cook and eat the sunflower\r\nroot (_Balsamorrhiza sagittata,_ Nutt.), but they used to regard it\r\nas a mysterious being, and observed a number of taboos in connexion\r\nwith it; for example, women who were engaged in digging or cooking\r\nthe root must practice continence, and no man might come near the\r\noven where the women were baking the root. When young people ate the\r\nfirst berries, roots, or other products of the season, they\r\naddressed a prayer to the Sunflower-Root as follows: "I inform thee\r\nthat I intend to eat thee. Mayest thou always help me to ascend, so\r\nthat I may always be able to reach the tops of mountains, and may I\r\nnever be clumsy! I ask this from thee, Sunflower-Root. Thou art the\r\ngreatest of all in mystery." To omit this prayer would make the\r\neater lazy and cause him to sleep long in the morning.\r\n\r\nThese customs of the Thompson and other Indian tribes of North-West\r\nAmerica are instructive, because they clearly indicate the motive,\r\nor at least one of the motives, which underlies the ceremonies\r\nobserved at eating the first fruits of the season. That motive in\r\nthe case of these Indians is simply a belief that the plant itself\r\nis animated by a conscious and more or less powerful spirit, who\r\nmust be propitiated before the people can safely partake of the\r\nfruits or roots which are supposed to be part of his body. Now if\r\nthis is true of wild fruits and roots, we may infer with some\r\nprobability that it is also true of cultivated fruits and roots,\r\nsuch as yams, and in particular that it holds good of the cereals,\r\nsuch as wheat, barley, oats, rice, and maize. In all cases it seems\r\nreasonable to infer that the scruples which savages manifest at\r\neating the first fruits of any crop, and the ceremonies which they\r\nobserve before they overcome their scruples, are due at least in\r\nlarge measure to a notion that the plant or tree is animated by a\r\nspirit or even a deity, whose leave must be obtained, or whose\r\nfavour must be sought, before it is possible to partake with safety\r\nof the new crop. This indeed is plainly affirmed of the Aino: they\r\ncall the millet "the divine cereal," "the cereal deity," and they\r\npray to and worship him before they will eat of the cakes made from\r\nthe new millet. And even where the indwelling divinity of the first\r\nfruits is not expressly affirmed, it appears to be implied both by\r\nthe solemn preparations made for eating them and by the danger\r\nsupposed to be incurred by persons who venture to partake of them\r\nwithout observing the prescribed ritual. In all such cases,\r\naccordingly, we may not improperly describe the eating of the new\r\nfruits as a sacrament or communion with a deity, or at all events\r\nwith a powerful spirit.\r\n\r\nAmong the usages which point to this conclusion are the custom of\r\nemploying either new or specially reserved vessels to hold the new\r\nfruits, and the practice of purifying the persons of the\r\ncommunicants before it is lawful to engage in the solemn act of\r\ncommunion with the divinity. Of all the modes of purification\r\nadopted on these occasions none perhaps brings out the sacramental\r\nvirtue of the rite so clearly as the Creek and Seminole practice of\r\ntaking a purgative before swallowing the new corn. The intention is\r\nthereby to prevent the sacred food from being polluted by contact\r\nwith common food in the stomach of the eater. For the same reason\r\nCatholics partake of the Eucharist fasting; and among the pastoral\r\nMasai of Eastern Africa the young warriors, who live on meat and\r\nmilk exclusively, are obliged to eat nothing but milk for so many\r\ndays and then nothing but meat for so many more, and before they\r\npass from the one food to the other they must make sure that none of\r\nthe old food remains in their stomachs; this they do by swallowing a\r\nvery powerful purgative and emetic.\r\n\r\nIn some of the festivals which we have examined, the sacrament of\r\nfirst-fruits is combined with a sacrifice or presentation of them to\r\ngods or spirits, and in course of time the sacrifice of first-fruits\r\ntends to throw the sacrament into the shade, if not to supersede it.\r\nThe mere fact of offering the first-fruits to the gods or spirits\r\ncomes now to be thought a sufficient preparation for eating the new\r\ncorn; the higher powers having received their share, man is free to\r\nenjoy the rest. This mode of viewing the new fruits implies that\r\nthey are regarded no longer as themselves instinct with divine life,\r\nbut merely as a gift bestowed by the gods upon man, who is bound to\r\nexpress his gratitude and homage to his divine benefactors by\r\nreturning to them a portion of their bounty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Eating the God among the Aztecs\r\n\r\nTHE CUSTOM of eating bread sacramentally as the body of a god was\r\npractised by the Aztecs before the discovery and conquest of Mexico\r\nby the Spaniards. Twice a year, in May and December, an image of the\r\ngreat Mexican god Huitzilopochtli or Vitzilipuztli was made of\r\ndough, then broken in pieces, and solemnly eaten by his worshippers.\r\nThe May ceremony is thus described by the historian Acosta: "The\r\nMexicans in the month of May made their principal feast to their god\r\nVitzilipuztli, and two days before this feast, the virgins whereof I\r\nhave spoken (the which were shut up and secluded in the same temple\r\nand were as it were religious women) did mingle a quantity of the\r\nseed of beets with roasted maize, and then they did mould it with\r\nhoney, making an idol of that paste in bigness like to that of wood,\r\nputting instead of eyes grains of green glass, of blue or white; and\r\nfor teeth grains of maize set forth with all the ornament and\r\nfurniture that I have said. This being finished, all the noblemen\r\ncame and brought it an exquisite and rich garment, like unto that of\r\nthe idol, wherewith they did attire it. Being thus clad and deckt,\r\nthey did set it in an azured chair and in a litter to carry it on\r\ntheir shoulders. The morning of this feast being come, an hour\r\nbefore day all the maidens came forth attired in white, with new\r\nornaments, the which that day were called the Sisters of their god\r\nVitzilipuztli, they came crowned with garlands of maize roasted and\r\nparched, being like unto azahar or the flower of orange; and about\r\ntheir necks they had great chains of the same, which went\r\nbauldrick-wise under their left arm. Their cheeks were dyed with\r\nvermilion, their arms from the elbow to the wrist were covered with\r\nred parrots\' feathers." Young men, dressed in red robes and crowned\r\nlike the virgins with maize, then carried the idol in its litter to\r\nthe foot of the great pyramid-shaped temple, up the steep and narrow\r\nsteps of which it was drawn to the music of flutes, trumpets,\r\ncornets, and drums. "While they mounted up the idol all the people\r\nstood in the court with much reverence and fear. Being mounted to\r\nthe top, and that they had placed it in a little lodge of roses\r\nwhich they held ready, presently came the young men, which strewed\r\nmany flowers of sundry kinds, wherewith they filled the temple both\r\nwithin and without. This done, all the virgins came out of their\r\nconvent, bringing pieces of paste compounded of beets and roasted\r\nmaize, which was of the same paste whereof their idol was made and\r\ncompounded, and they were of the fashion of great bones. They\r\ndelivered them to the young men, who carried them up and laid them\r\nat the idol\'s feet, wherewith they filled the whole place that it\r\ncould receive no more. They called these morsels of paste the flesh\r\nand bones of Vitzilipuztli. Having laid abroad these bones,\r\npresently came all the ancients of the temple, priests, Levites, and\r\nall the rest of the ministers, according to their dignities and\r\nantiquities (for herein there was a strict order amongst them) one\r\nafter another, with their veils of diverse colours and works, every\r\none according to his dignity and office, having garlands upon their\r\nheads and chains of flowers about their necks; after them came their\r\ngods and goddesses whom they worshipped, of diverse figures, attired\r\nin the same livery; then putting themselves in order about those\r\nmorsels and pieces of paste, they used certain ceremonies with\r\nsinging and dancing. By means whereof they were blessed and\r\nconsecrated for the flesh and bones of this idol. This ceremony and\r\nblessing (whereby they were taken for the flesh and bones of the\r\nidol) being ended, they honoured those pieces in the same sort as\r\ntheir god. . . . All the city came to this goodly spectacle, and\r\nthere was a commandment very strictly observed throughout all the\r\nland, that the day of the feast of the idol of Vitzilipuztli they\r\nshould eat no other meat but this paste, with honey, whereof the\r\nidol was made. And this should be eaten at the point of day, and\r\nthey should drink no water nor any other thing till after noon: they\r\nheld it for an ill sign, yea, for sacrilege to do the contrary: but\r\nafter the ceremonies ended, it was lawful for them to eat anything.\r\nDuring the time of this ceremony they hid the water from their\r\nlittle children, admonishing all such as had the use of reason not\r\nto drink any water; which, if they did, the anger of God would come\r\nupon them, and they should die, which they did observe very\r\ncarefully and strictly. The ceremonies, dancing, and sacrifice\r\nended, the went to unclothe themselves, and the priests and\r\nsuperiors of the temple took the idol of paste, which they spoiled\r\nof all the ornaments it had, and made many pieces, as well of the\r\nidol itself as of the truncheons which they consecrated, and then\r\nthey gave them to the people in manner of a communion, beginning\r\nwith the greater, and continuing unto the rest, both men, women, and\r\nlittle children, who received it with such tears, fear, and\r\nreverence as it was an admirable thing, saying that they did eat the\r\nflesh and bones of God, where-with they were grieved. Such as had\r\nany sick folks demanded thereof for them, and carried it with great\r\nreverence and veneration."\r\n\r\nFrom this interesting passage we learn that the ancient Mexicans,\r\neven before the arrival of Christian missionaries, were fully\r\nacquainted with the doctrine of transubstantiation and acted upon it\r\nin the solemn rites of their religion. They believed that by\r\nconsecrating bread their priests could turn it into the very body of\r\ntheir god, so that all who thereupon partook of the consecrated\r\nbread entered into a mystic communion with the deity by receiving a\r\nportion of his divine substance into themselves. The doctrine of\r\ntransubstantiation, or the magical conversion of bread into flesh,\r\nwas also familiar to the Aryans of ancient India long before the\r\nspread and even the rise of Christianity. The Brahmans taught that\r\nthe rice-cakes offered in sacrifice were substitutes for human\r\nbeings, and that they were actually converted into the real bodies\r\nof men by the manipulation of the priest. We read that "when it (the\r\nrice-cake) still consists of rice-meal, it is the hair. When he\r\npours water on it, it becomes skin. When he mixes it, it becomes\r\nflesh: for then it becomes consistent; and consistent also is the\r\nflesh. When it is baked, it becomes bone: for then it becomes\r\nsomewhat hard; and hard is the bone. And when he is about to take it\r\noff (the fire) and sprinkles it with butter, he changes it into\r\nmarrow. This is the completeness which they call the fivefold animal\r\nsacrifice."\r\n\r\nNow, too, we can perfectly understand why on the day of their solemn\r\ncommunion with the deity the Mexicans refused to eat any other food\r\nthan the consecrated bread which they revered as the very flesh and\r\nbones of their God, and why up till noon they might drink nothing at\r\nall, not even water. They feared no doubt to defile the portion of\r\nGod in their stomachs by contact with common things. A similar pious\r\nfear led the Creek and Seminole Indians, as we saw, to adopt the\r\nmore thoroughgoing expedient of rinsing out their bodies by a strong\r\npurgative before they dared to partake of the sacrament of\r\nfirst-fruits.\r\n\r\nAt the festival of the winter solstice in December the Aztecs killed\r\ntheir god Huitzilopochtli in effigy first and ate him afterwards. As\r\na preparation for this solemn ceremony an image of the deity in the\r\nlikeness of a man was fashioned out of seeds of various sorts, which\r\nwere kneaded into a dough with the blood of children. The bones of\r\nthe god were represented by pieces of acacia wood. This image was\r\nplaced on the chief altar of the temple, and on the day of the\r\nfestival the king offered incense to it. Early next day it was taken\r\ndown and set on its feet in a great hall. Then a priest, who bore\r\nthe name and acted the part of the god Quetzalcoatl, took a\r\nflint-tipped dart and hurled it into the breast of the dough-image,\r\npiercing it through and through. This was called "killing the god\r\nHuitzilopochtli so that his body might be eaten." One of the priests\r\ncut out the heart of the image and gave it to the king to eat. The\r\nrest of the image was divided into minute pieces, of which every man\r\ngreat and small, down to the male children in the cradle, receive\r\none to eat. But no woman might taste a morsel. The ceremony was\r\ncalled _teoqualo,_ that is, "god is eaten."\r\n\r\nAt another festival the Mexicans made little images like men, which\r\nstood for the cloud-capped mountains. These images were moulded of a\r\npaste of various seeds and were dressed in paper ornaments. Some\r\npeople fashioned five, others ten, others as many as fifteen of\r\nthem. Having been made, they were placed in the oratory of each\r\nhouse and worshipped. Four times in the course of the night\r\nofferings of food were brought to them in tiny vessels; and people\r\nsang and played the flute before them through all the hours of\r\ndarkness. At break of day the priests stabbed the images with a\r\nweaver\'s instrument, cut off their heads, and tore out their hearts,\r\nwhich they presented to the master of the house on a green saucer.\r\nThe bodies of the images were then eaten by all the family,\r\nespecially by the servants, "in order that by eating them they might\r\nbe preserved from certain distempers, to which those persons who\r\nwere negligent of worship to those deities conceived themselves to\r\nbe subject."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Many Manii at Aricia\r\n\r\nWE are now able to suggest an explanation of the proverb "There are\r\nmany Manii at Aricia." Certain loaves made in the shape of men were\r\ncalled by the Romans _maniae,_ and it appears that this kind of loaf\r\nwas especially made at Aricia. Now, Mania, the name of one of these\r\nloaves, was also the name of the Mother or Grandmother of Ghosts, to\r\nwhom woollen effigies of men and women were dedicated at the\r\nfestival of the Compitalia. These effigies were hung at the doors of\r\nall the houses in Rome; one effigy was hung up for every free person\r\nin the house, and one effigy, of a different kind, for every slave.\r\nThe reason was that on this day the ghosts of the dead were believed\r\nto be going about, and it was hoped that, either out of good nature\r\nor through simple inadvertence, they would carry off the effigies at\r\nthe door instead of the living people in the house. According to\r\ntradition, these woollen figures were substitutes for a former\r\ncustom of sacrificing human beings. Upon data so fragmentary and\r\nuncertain, it is impossible to build with confidence; but it seems\r\nworth suggesting that the loaves in human form, which appear to have\r\nbeen baked at Aricia, were sacramental bread, and that in the old\r\ndays, when the divine King of the Wood was annually slain, loaves\r\nwere made in his image, like the paste figures of the gods in\r\nMexico, and were eaten sacramentally by his worshippers. The Mexican\r\nsacraments in honour of Huitzilopochtli were also accompanied by the\r\nsacrifice of human victims. The tradition that the founder of the\r\nsacred grove at Aricia was a man named Manius, from whom many Manii\r\nwere descended, would thus be an etymological myth invented to\r\nexplain the name _maniae_ as applied to these sacramental loaves. A\r\ndim recollection of the original connexion of the loaves with human\r\nsacrifices may perhaps be traced in the story that the effigies\r\ndedicated to Mania at the Compitalia were substitutes for human\r\nvictims. The story itself, however, is probably devoid of\r\nfoundation, since the practice of putting up dummies to divert the\r\nattention of ghosts or demons from living people is not uncommon.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Tibetans stand in fear of innumerable earth-demons,\r\nall of whom are under the authority of Old Mother Kh\xf6n-ma. This\r\ngoddess, who may be compared to the Roman Mania, the Mother or\r\nGrandmother of Ghosts, is dressed in golden-yellow robes, holds a\r\ngolden noose in her hand, and rides on a ram. In order to bar the\r\ndwelling-house against the foul fiends, of whom Old Mother Kh\xf6n-ma\r\nis mistress, an elaborate structure somewhat resembling a chandelier\r\nis fixed above the door on the outside of the house. It contains a\r\nram\'s skull, a variety of precious objects such as gold-leaf,\r\nsilver, and turquoise, also some dry food, such as rice, wheat, and\r\npulse, and finally images or pictures of a man, a woman, and a\r\nhouse. "The object of these figures of a man, wife, and house is to\r\ndeceive the demons should they still come in spite of this offering,\r\nand to mislead them into the belief that the foregoing pictures are\r\nthe inmates of the house, so that they may wreak their wrath on\r\nthese bits of wood and to save the real human occupants." When all\r\nis ready, a priest prays to Old Mother Kh\xf6n-ma that she would be\r\npleased to accept these dainty offerings and to close the open doors\r\nof the earth, in order that the demons may not come forth to infest\r\nand injure the household.\r\n\r\nAgain, effigies are often employed as a means of preventing or\r\ncuring sickness; the demons of disease either mistake the effigies\r\nfor living people or are persuaded or compelled to enter them,\r\nleaving the real men and women well and whole. Thus the Alfoors of\r\nMinahassa, in Celebes, will sometimes transport a sick man to\r\nanother house, while they leave on his bed a dummy made up of a\r\npillow and clothes. This dummy the demon is supposed to mistake for\r\nthe sick man, who consequently recovers. Cure or prevention of this\r\nsort seems to find especial favour with the natives of Borneo. Thus,\r\nwhen an epidemic is raging among them, the Dyaks of the Katoengouw\r\nRiver set up wooden images at their doors in the hope that the\r\ndemons of the plague may be deluded into carrying off the effigies\r\ninstead of the people. Among the Oloh Ngadju of Borneo, when a sick\r\nman is supposed to be suffering from the assaults of a ghost,\r\npuppets of dough or rice-meal are made and thrown under the house as\r\nsubstitutes for the patient, who thus rids himself of the ghost. In\r\ncertain of the western districts of Borneo if a man is taken\r\nsuddenly and violently sick, the physician, who in this part of the\r\nworld is generally an old woman, fashions a wooden image and brings\r\nit seven times into contact with the sufferer\'s head, while she\r\nsays: "This image serves to take the place of the sick man;\r\nsickness, pass over into the image." Then, with some rice, salt, and\r\ntobacco in a little basket, the substitute is carried to the spot\r\nwhere the evil spirit is supposed to have entered into the man.\r\nThere it is set upright on the ground, after the physician has\r\ninvoked the spirit as follows: "O devil, here is an image which\r\nstands instead of the sick man. Release the soul of the sick man and\r\nplague the image, for it is indeed prettier and better than he."\r\nBatak magicians can conjure the demon of disease out of the\r\npatient\'s body into an image made out of a banana-tree with a human\r\nface and wrapt up in magic herbs; the image is then hurriedly\r\nremoved and thrown away or buried beyond the boundaries of the\r\nvillage. Sometimes the image, dressed as a man or a woman according\r\nto the sex of the patient, is deposited at a cross-road or other\r\nthoroughfare, in the hope that some passer-by, seeing it, may start\r\nand cry out, "Ah! So-and-So is dead"; for such an exclamation is\r\nsupposed to delude the demon of disease into a belief that he has\r\naccomplished his fell purpose, so he takes himself off and leaves\r\nthe sufferer to get well. The Mai Darat, a Sakai tribe of the Malay\r\nPeninsula, attribute all kinds of diseases to the agency of spirits\r\nwhich they call _nyani;_ fortunately, however, the magician can\r\ninduce these maleficent beings to come out of the sick person and\r\ntake up their abode in rude figures of grass, which are hung up\r\noutside the houses in little bell-shaped shrines decorated with\r\npeeled sticks. During an epidemic of small-pox the Ewe negroes will\r\nsometimes clear a space outside of the town, where they erect a\r\nnumber of low mounds and cover them with as many little clay figures\r\nas there are people in the place. Pots of food and water are also\r\nset out for the refreshment of the spirit of small-pox who, it is\r\nhoped, will take the clay figures and spare the living folk; and to\r\nmake assurance doubly sure the road into the town is barricaded\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nWith these examples before us we may surmise that the woollen\r\neffigies, which at the festival of the Compitalia might be seen\r\nhanging at the doors of all the houses in ancient Rome, were not\r\nsubstitutes for human victims who had formerly been sacrificed at\r\nthis season, but rather vicarious offerings presented to the Mother\r\nor Grandmother of Ghosts, in the hope that on her rounds through the\r\ncity she would accept or mistake the effigies for the inmates of the\r\nhouse and so spare the living for another year. It is possible that\r\nthe puppets made of rushes, which in the month of May the pontiffs\r\nand Vestal Virgins annually threw into the Tiber from the old\r\nSublician bridge at Rome, had originally the same significance; that\r\nis, they may have been designed to purge the city from demoniac\r\ninfluence by diverting the attention of the demons from human beings\r\nto the puppets and then toppling the whole uncanny crew, neck and\r\ncrop, into the river, which would soon sweep them far out to sea. In\r\nprecisely the same way the natives of Old Calabar used periodically\r\nto rid their town of the devils which infested it by luring the\r\nunwary demons into a number of lamentable scarecrows, which they\r\nafterwards flung into the river. This interpretation of the Roman\r\ncustom is supported to some extent by the evidence of Plutarch, who\r\nspeaks of the ceremony as "the greatest of purifications."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLI. Homeopathic Magic of a Flesh Diet\r\n\r\nTHE PRACTICE of killing a god has now been traced amongst peoples\r\nwho have reached the agricultural stage of society. We have seen\r\nthat the spirit of the corn, or of other cultivated plants, is\r\ncommonly represented either in human or in animal form, and that in\r\nsome places a custom has prevailed of killing annually either the\r\nhuman or the animal representative of the god. One reason for thus\r\nkilling the corn-spirit in the person of his representative has been\r\ngiven implicitly in an earlier part of this work: we may suppose\r\nthat the intention was to guard him or her (for the corn-spirit is\r\noften feminine) from the enfeeblement of old age by transferring the\r\nspirit, while still hale and hearty, to the person of a youthful and\r\nvigorous successor. Apart from the desirability of renewing his\r\ndivine energies, the death of the corn-spirit may have been deemed\r\ninevitable under the sickles or the knives of the reapers, and his\r\nworshippers may accordingly have felt bound to acquiesce in the sad\r\nnecessity. But, further, we have found a widespread custom of eating\r\nthe god sacramentally, either in the shape of the man or animal who\r\nrepresents the god, or in the shape of bread made in human or animal\r\nform. The reasons for thus partaking of the body of the god are,\r\nfrom the primitive standpoint, simple enough. The savage commonly\r\nbelieves that by eating the flesh of an animal or man he acquires\r\nnot only the physical, but even the moral and intellectual qualities\r\nwhich were characteristic of that animal or man; so when the\r\ncreature is deemed divine, our simple savage naturally expects to\r\nabsorb a portion of its divinity along with its material substance.\r\nIt may be well to illustrate by instances this common faith in the\r\nacquisition of virtues or vices of many kinds through the medium of\r\nanimal food, even when there is no pretence that the viands consist\r\nof the body or blood of a god. The doctrine forms part of the widely\r\nramified system of sympathetic or homoeopathic magic.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, the Creeks, Cherokee, and kindred tribes of North\r\nAmerican Indians "believe that nature is possest of such a property\r\nas to transfuse into men and animals the qualities, either of the\r\nfood they use, or of those objects that are presented to their\r\nsenses; he who feeds on venison is, according to their physical\r\nsystem, swifter and more sagacious than the man who lives on the\r\nflesh of the clumsy bear, or helpless dunghill fowls, the\r\nslow-footed tame cattle, or the heavy wallowing swine. This is the\r\nreason that several of their old men recommend, and say, that\r\nformerly their greatest chieftains observed a constant rule in their\r\ndiet, and seldom ate of any animal of a gross quality, or heavy\r\nmotion of body, fancying it conveyed a dullness through the whole\r\nsystem, and disabled them from exerting themselves with proper\r\nvigour in their martial, civil, and religious duties." The Zaparo\r\nIndians of Ecuador "will, unless from necessity, in most cases not\r\neat any heavy meats, such as tapir and peccary, but confine\r\nthemselves to birds, monkeys, deer, fish, etc., principally because\r\nthey argue that the heavier meats make them unwieldy, like the\r\nanimals who supply the flesh, impeding their agility, and unfitting\r\nthem for the chase." Similarly some of the Brazilian Indians would\r\neat no beast, bird, or fish that ran, flew, or swam slowly, lest by\r\npartaking of its flesh they should lose their ability and be unable\r\nto escape from their enemies. The Caribs abstained from the flesh of\r\npigs lest it should cause them to have small eyes like pigs; and\r\nthey refused to partake of tortoises from a fear that if they did so\r\nthey would become heavy and stupid like the animal. Among the Fans\r\nof West Africa men in the prime of life never eat tortoises for a\r\nsimilar reason; they imagine that if they did so, their vigour and\r\nfleetness of foot would be gone. But old men may eat tortoises\r\nfreely, because having already lost the power of running they can\r\ntake no harm from the flesh of the slow-footed creature.\r\n\r\nWhile many savages thus fear to eat the flesh of slow-footed animals\r\nlest they should themselves become slow-footed, the Bushmen of South\r\nAfrica purposely ate the flesh of such creatures, and the reason\r\nwhich they gave for doing so exhibits a curious refinement of savage\r\nphilosophy. They imagined that the game which they pursued would be\r\ninfluenced sympathetically by the food in the body of the hunter, so\r\nthat if he had eaten of swift-footed animals, the quarry would be\r\nswift-footed also and would escape him; whereas if he had eaten of\r\nslow-footed animals, the quarry would also be slow-footed, and he\r\nwould be able to overtake and kill it. For that reason hunters of\r\ngemsbok particularly avoided eating the flesh of the swift and agile\r\nspringbok; indeed they would not even touch it with their hands,\r\nbecause they believed the springbok to be a very lively creature\r\nwhich did not go to sleep at night, and they thought that if they\r\nate springbok, the gemsbok which they hunted would likewise not be\r\nwilling to go to sleep, even at night. How, then, could they catch\r\nit?\r\n\r\nThe Namaquas abstain from eating the flesh of hares, because they\r\nthink it would make them faint-hearted as a hare. But they eat the\r\nflesh of the lion, or drink the blood of the leopard or lion, to get\r\nthe courage and strength of these beasts. The Bushmen will not give\r\ntheir children a jackal\'s heart to eat, lest it should make them\r\ntimid like the jackal; but they give them a leopard\'s heart to eat\r\nto make them brave like the leopard. When a Wagogo man of East\r\nAfrica kills a lion, he eats the heart in order to become brave like\r\na lion; but he thinks that to eat the heart of a hen would make him\r\ntimid. When a serious disease has attacked a Zulu kraal, the\r\nmedicine-man takes the bone of a very old dog, or the bone of an old\r\ncow, bull, or other very old animal, and administers it to the\r\nhealthy as well as to the sick people, in order that they may live\r\nto be as old as the animal of whose bone they have partaken. So to\r\nrestore the aged Aeson to youth, the witch Medea infused into his\r\nveins a decoction of the liver of the long-lived deer and the head\r\nof a crow that had outlived nine generations of men.\r\n\r\nAmong the Dyaks of North-West Borneo young men and warriors may not\r\neat venison, because it would make them as timid as deer; but the\r\nwomen and very old men are free to eat it. However, among the Kayans\r\nof the same region, who share the same view as to the ill effect of\r\neating venison, men will partake of the dangerous viand provided it\r\nis cooked in the open air, for then the timid spirit of the animal\r\nis supposed to escape at once into the jungle and not to enter into\r\nthe eater. The Aino believe that the heart of the water-ousel is\r\nexceedingly wise, and that in speech the bird is most eloquent.\r\nTherefore whenever he is killed, he should be at once torn open and\r\nhis heart wrenched out and swallowed before it has time to grow cold\r\nor suffer damage of any kind. If a man swallows it thus, he will\r\nbecome very fluent and wise, and will be able to argue down all his\r\nadversaries. In Northern India people fancy that if you eat the\r\neyeballs of an owl you will be able like an owl to see in the dark.\r\n\r\nWhen the Kansas Indians were going to war, a feast used to be held\r\nin the chief\'s hut, and the principal dish was dog\'s flesh, because,\r\nsaid the Indians, the animal who is so brave that he will let\r\nhimself be cut in pieces in defence of his master, must needs\r\ninspire valour. Men of the Buru and Aru Islands, East Indies, eat\r\nthe flesh of dogs in order to be bold and nimble in war. Amongst the\r\nPapuans of the Port Moresby and Motumotu districts, New Guinea,\r\nyoung lads eat strong pig, wallaby, and large fish, in order to\r\nacquire the strength of the animal or fish. Some of the natives of\r\nNorthern Australia fancy that by eating the flesh of the kangaroo or\r\nemu they are enabled to jump or run faster than before. The Miris of\r\nAssam prize tiger\'s flesh as food for men; it gives them strength\r\nand courage. But "it is not suited for women; it would make them too\r\nstrong-minded." In Corea the bones of tigers fetch a higher price\r\nthan those of leopards as a means of inspiring courage. A Chinaman\r\nin Seoul bought and ate a whole tiger to make himself brave and\r\nfierce. In Norse legend, Ingiald, son of King Aunund, was timid in\r\nhis youth, but after eating the heart of a wolf he became very bold;\r\nHialto gained strength and courage by eating the heart of a bear and\r\ndrinking its blood.\r\n\r\nIn Morocco lethargic patients are given ants to swallow, and to eat\r\nlion\'s flesh will make a coward brave; but people abstain from\r\neating the hearts of fowls, lest thereby they should be rendered\r\ntimid. When a child is late in learning to speak, the Turks of\r\nCentral Asia will give it the tongues of certain birds to eat. A\r\nNorth American Indian thought that brandy must be a decoction of\r\nhearts and tongues, "because," said he, "after drinking it I fear\r\nnothing, and I talk wonderfully." In Java there is a tiny earthworm\r\nwhich now and then utters a shrill sound like that of the alarum of\r\na small clock. Hence when a public dancing girl has screamed herself\r\nhoarse in the exercise of her calling, the leader of the troop makes\r\nher eat some of these worms, in the belief that thus she will regain\r\nher voice and will, after swallowing them, be able to scream as\r\nshrilly as ever. The people of Darfur, in Central Africa, think that\r\nthe liver is the seat of the soul, and that a man may enlarge his\r\nsoul by eating the liver of an animal. "Whenever an animal is killed\r\nits liver is taken out and eaten, but the people are most careful\r\nnot to touch it with their hands, as it is considered sacred; it is\r\ncut up in small pieces and eaten raw, the bits being conveyed to the\r\nmouth on the point of a knife, or the sharp point of a stick. Any\r\none who may accidentally touch the liver is strictly forbidden to\r\npartake of it, which prohibition is regarded as a great misfortune\r\nfor him." Women are not allowed to eat liver, because they have no\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nAgain, the flesh and blood of dead men are commonly eaten and drunk\r\nto inspire bravery, wisdom, or other qualities for which the men\r\nthemselves were remarkable, or which are supposed to have their\r\nspecial seat in the particular part eaten. Thus among the mountain\r\ntribes of South-Eastern Africa there are ceremonies by which the\r\nyouths are formed into guilds or lodges, and among the rites of\r\ninitiation there is one which is intended to infuse courage,\r\nintelligence, and other qualities into the novices. Whenever an\r\nenemy who has behaved with conspicuous bravery is killed, his liver,\r\nwhich is considered the seat of valour; his ears, which are supposed\r\nto be the seat of intelligence; the skin of his forehead, which is\r\nregarded as the seat of perseverance; his testicles, which are held\r\nto be the seat of strength; and other members, which are viewed as\r\nthe seat of other virtues, are cut from his body and baked to\r\ncinders. The ashes are carefully kept in the horn of a bull, and,\r\nduring the ceremonies observed at circumcision, are mixed with other\r\ningredients into a kind of paste, which is administered by the\r\ntribal priest to the youths. By this means the strength, valour,\r\nintelligence, and other virtues of the slain are believed to be\r\nimparted to the eaters. When Basutos of the mountains have killed a\r\nvery brave foe, they immediately cut out his heart and eat it,\r\nbecause this is supposed to give them his courage and strength in\r\nbattle. When Sir Charles M\'Carthy was killed by the Ashantees in\r\n1824, it is said that his heart was devoured by the chiefs of the\r\nAshantee army, who hoped by this means to imbibe his courage. His\r\nflesh was dried and parcelled out among the lower officers for the\r\nsame purpose, and his bones were long kept at Coomassie as national\r\nfetishes. The Nauras Indians of New Granada ate the hearts of\r\nSpaniards when they had the opportunity, hoping thereby to make\r\nthemselves as dauntless as the dreaded Castilian chivalry. The Sioux\r\nIndians used to reduce to powder the heart of a valiant enemy and\r\nswallow the powder, hoping thus to appropriate the dead man\'s\r\nvalour.\r\n\r\nBut while the human heart is thus commonly eaten for the sake of\r\nimbuing the eater with the qualities of its original owner, it is\r\nnot, as we have already seen, the only part of the body which is\r\nconsumed for this purpose. Thus warriors of the Theddora and Ngarigo\r\ntribes of South-Eastern Australia used to eat the hands and feet of\r\ntheir slain enemies, believing that in this way they acquired some\r\nof the qualities and courage of the dead. The Kamilaroi of New South\r\nWales ate the liver as well as the heart of a brave man to get his\r\ncourage. In Tonquin also there is a popular superstition that the\r\nliver of a brave man makes brave any who partake of it. With a like\r\nintent the Chinese swallow the bile of notorious bandits who have\r\nbeen executed. The Dyaks of Sarawak used to eat the palms of the\r\nhands and the flesh of the knees of the slain in order to steady\r\ntheir own hands and strengthen their own knees. The Tolalaki,\r\nnotorious head-hunters of Central Celebes, drink the blood and eat\r\nthe brains of their victims that they may become brave. The Italones\r\nof the Philippine Islands drink the blood of their slain enemies,\r\nand eat part of the back of their heads and of their entrails raw to\r\nacquire their courage. For the same reason the Efugaos, another\r\ntribe of the Philippines, suck the brains of their foes. In like\r\nmanner the Kai of German New Guinea eat the brains of the enemies\r\nthey kill in order to acquire their strength. Among the Kimbunda of\r\nWestern Africa, when a new king succeeds to the throne, a brave\r\nprisoner of war is killed in order that the king and nobles may eat\r\nhis flesh, and so acquire his strength and courage. The notorious\r\nZulu chief Matuana drank the gall of thirty chiefs, whose people he\r\nhad destroyed, in the belief that it would make him strong. It is a\r\nZulu fancy that by eating the centre of the forehead and the eyebrow\r\nof an enemy they acquire the power of looking steadfastly at a foe.\r\nBefore every warlike expedition the people of Minahassa in Celebes\r\nused to take the locks of hair of a slain foe and dabble them in\r\nboiling water to extract the courage; this infusion of bravery was\r\nthen drunk by the warriors. In New Zealand "the chief was an _atua_\r\n[god], but there were powerful and powerless gods; each naturally\r\nsought to make himself one of the former; the plan therefore adopted\r\nwas to incorporate the spirits of others with their own; thus, when\r\na warrior slew a chief, he immediately gouged out his eyes and\r\nswallowed them, the _atua tonga,_ or divinity, being supposed to\r\nreside in that organ; thus he not only killed the body, but also\r\npossessed himself of the soul of his enemy, and consequently the\r\nmore chiefs he slew the greater did his divinity become."\r\n\r\nIt is now easy to understand why a savage should desire to partake\r\nof the flesh of an animal or man whom he regards as divine. By\r\neating the body of the god he shares in the god\'s attributes and\r\npowers. And when the god is a corn-god, the corn is his proper body;\r\nwhen he is a vine-god, the juice of the grape is his blood; and so\r\nby eating the bread and drinking the wine the worshipper partakes of\r\nthe real body and blood of his god. Thus the drinking of wine in the\r\nrites of a vine-god like Dionysus is not an act of revelry, it is a\r\nsolemn sacrament. Yet a time comes when reasonable men find it hard\r\nto understand how any one in his senses can suppose that by eating\r\nbread or drinking wine he consumes the body or blood of a deity.\r\n"When we call corn Ceres and wine Bacchus," says Cicero, "we use a\r\ncommon figure of speech; but do you imagine that anybody is so\r\ninsane as to believe that the thing he feeds upon is a god?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLII. Killing the Divine Animal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Killing the Sacred Buzzard\r\n\r\nIN THE PRECEDING chapters we saw that many communities which have\r\nprogressed so far as to subsist mainly by agriculture have been in\r\nthe habit of killing and eating their farinaceous deities either in\r\ntheir proper form of corn, rice, and so forth, or in the borrowed\r\nshapes of animals and men. It remains to show that hunting and\r\npastoral tribes, as well as agricultural peoples, have been in the\r\nhabit of killing the beings whom they worship. Among the worshipful\r\nbeings or gods, if indeed they deserve to be dignified by that name,\r\nwhom hunters and shepherds adore and kill are animals pure and\r\nsimple, not animals regarded as embodiments of other supernatural\r\nbeings. Our first example is drawn from the Indians of California,\r\nwho living in a fertile country under a serene and temperate sky,\r\nnevertheless rank near the bottom of the savage scale. The\r\nAcagchemem tribe adored the great buzzard, and once a year they\r\ncelebrated a great festival called _Panes_ or bird-feast in its\r\nhonour. The day selected for the festival was made known to the\r\npublic on the evening before its celebration and preparations were\r\nat once made for the erection of a special temple (_vanquech_),\r\nwhich seems to have been a circular or oval enclosure of stakes with\r\nthe stuffed skin of a coyote or prairie-wolf set up on a hurdle to\r\nrepresent the god Chinigchinich. When the temple was ready, the bird\r\nwas carried into it in solemn procession and laid on an altar\r\nerected for the purpose. Then all the young women, whether married\r\nor single, began to run to and fro, as if distracted, some in one\r\ndirection and some in another, while the elders of both sexes\r\nremained silent spectators of the scene, and the captains, tricked\r\nout in paint and feathers, danced round their adored bird. These\r\nceremonies being concluded, they seized upon the bird and carried it\r\nto the principal temple, all the assembly uniting in the grand\r\ndisplay, and the captains dancing and singing at the head of the\r\nprocession. Arrived at the temple, they killed the bird without\r\nlosing a drop of its blood. The skin was removed entire and\r\npreserved with the feathers as a relic or for the purpose of making\r\nthe festal garment or _paelt._ The carcase was buried in a hole in\r\nthe temple, and the old women gathered round the grave weeping and\r\nmoaning bitterly, while they threw various kinds of seeds or pieces\r\nof food on it, crying out, "Why did you run away? Would you not have\r\nbeen better with us? you would have made _pinole_ (a kind of gruel)\r\nas we do, and if you had not run away, you would not have become a\r\n_Panes,_" and so on. When this ceremony was concluded, the dancing\r\nwas resumed and kept up for three days and nights. They said that\r\nthe _Panes_ was a woman who had run off to the mountains and there\r\nbeen changed into a bird by the god Chinigchinich. They believed\r\nthat though they sacrificed the bird annually, she came to life\r\nagain and returned to her home in the mountains. Moreover, they\r\nthought that "as often as the bird was killed, it became multiplied;\r\nbecause every year all the different Capitanes celebrated the same\r\nfeast of _Panes,_ and were firm in the opinion that the birds\r\nsacrificed were but one and the same female."\r\n\r\nThe unity in multiplicity thus postulated by the Californians is\r\nvery noticeable and helps to explain their motive for killing the\r\ndivine bird. The notion of the life of a species as distinct from\r\nthat of an individual, easy and obvious as it seems to us, appears\r\nto be one which the Californian savage cannot grasp. He is unable to\r\nconceive the life of the species otherwise than as an individual\r\nlife, and therefore as exposed to the same dangers and calamities\r\nwhich menace and finally destroy the life of the individual.\r\nApparently he imagines that a species left to itself will grow old\r\nand die like an individual, and that therefore some step must be\r\ntaken to save from extinction the particular species which he\r\nregards as divine. The only means he can think of to avert the\r\ncatastrophe is to kill a member of the species in whose veins the\r\ntide of life is still running strong and has not yet stagnated among\r\nthe fens of old age. The life thus diverted from one channel will\r\nflow, he fancies, more freshly and freely in a new one; in other\r\nwords, the slain animal will revive and enter on a new term of life\r\nwith all the spring and energy of youth. To us this reasoning is\r\ntransparently absurd, but so too is the custom. A similar confusion,\r\nit may be noted, between the individual life and the life of the\r\nspecies was made by the Samoans. Each family had for its god a\r\nparticular species of animal; yet the death of one of these animals,\r\nfor example an owl, was not the death of the god, "he was supposed\r\nto be yet alive, and incarnate in all the owls in existence."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Killing the Sacred Ram\r\n\r\nTHE RUDE Californian rite which we have just considered has a close\r\nparallel in the religion of ancient Egypt. The Thebans and all other\r\nEgyptians who worshipped the Theban god Ammon held rams to be\r\nsacred, and would not sacrifice them. But once a year at the\r\nfestival of Ammon they killed a ram, skinned it, and clothed the\r\nimage of the god in the skin. Then they mourned over the ram and\r\nburied it in a sacred tomb. The custom was explained by a story that\r\nZeus had once exhibited himself to Hercules clad in the fleece and\r\nwearing the head of a ram. Of course the ram in this case was simply\r\nthe beast-god of Thebes, as the wolf was the beast-god of Lycopolis,\r\nand the goat was the beast-god of Mendes. In other words, the ram\r\nwas Ammon himself. On the monuments, it is true, Ammon appears in\r\nsemi-human form with the body of a man and the head of a ram. But\r\nthis only shows that he was in the usual chrysalis state through\r\nwhich beast-gods regularly pass before they emerge as full-blown\r\nanthropomorphic gods. The ram, therefore, was killed, not as a\r\nsacrifice to Ammon, but as the god himself, whose identity with the\r\nbeast is plainly shown by the custom of clothing his image in the\r\nskin of the slain ram. The reason for thus killing the ram-god\r\nannually may have been that which I have assigned for the general\r\ncustom of killing a god and for the special Californian custom of\r\nkilling the divine buzzard. As applied to Egypt, this explanation is\r\nsupported by the analogy of the bull-god Apis, who was not suffered\r\nto outlive a certain term of years. The intention of thus putting a\r\nlimit to the life of the human god was, as I have argued, to secure\r\nhim from the weakness and frailty of age. The same reasoning would\r\nexplain the custom--probably an older one--of putting the beast-god\r\nto death annually, as was done with the ram of Thebes.\r\n\r\nOne point in the Theban ritual--the application of the skin to the\r\nimage of the god--deserves particular attention. If the god was at\r\nfirst the living ram, his representation by an image must have\r\noriginated later. But how did it originate? One answer to this\r\nquestion is perhaps furnished by the practice of preserving the skin\r\nof the animal which is slain as divine. The Californians, as we have\r\nseen, preserved the skin of the buzzard; and the skin of the goat,\r\nwhich is killed on the harvest-field as a representative of the\r\ncorn-spirit, is kept for various superstitious purposes. The skin in\r\nfact was kept as a token or memorial of the god, or rather as\r\ncontaining in it a part of the divine life, and it had only to be\r\nstuffed or stretched upon a frame to become a regular image of him.\r\nAt first an image of this kind would be renewed annually, the new\r\nimage being provided by the skin of the slain animal. But from\r\nannual images to permanent images the transition is easy. We have\r\nseen that the older custom of cutting a new May-tree every year was\r\nsuperseded by the practice of maintaining a permanent May-pole,\r\nwhich was, however, annually decked with fresh leaves and flowers,\r\nand even surmounted each year by a fresh young tree. Similarly when\r\nthe stuffed skin, as a representative of the god, was replaced by a\r\npermanent image of him in wood, stone, or metal, the permanent image\r\nwas annually clad in the fresh skin of the slain animal. When this\r\nstage had been reached, the custom of killing the ram came naturally\r\nto be interpreted as a sacrifice offered to the image, and was\r\nexplained by a story like that of Ammon and Hercules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Killing the Sacred Serpent\r\n\r\nWEST AFRICA appears to furnish another example of the annual killing\r\nof a sacred animal and the preservation of its skin. The negroes of\r\nIssapoo, in the island of Fernando Po, regard the cobra-capella as\r\ntheir guardian deity, who can do them good or ill, bestow riches or\r\ninflict disease and death. The skin of one of these reptiles is hung\r\ntail downwards from a branch of the highest tree in the public\r\nsquare, and the placing of it on the tree is an annual ceremony. As\r\nsoon as the ceremony is over, all children born within the past year\r\nare carried out and their hands made to touch the tail of the\r\nserpent\'s skin. The latter custom is clearly a way of placing the\r\ninfants under the protection of the tribal god. Similarly in\r\nSenegambia a python is expected to visit every child of the Python\r\nclan within eight days after birth; and the Psylli, a Snake clan of\r\nancient Africa, used to expose their infants to snakes in the belief\r\nthat the snakes would not harm true-born children of the clan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Killing the Sacred Turtles\r\n\r\nIN THE CALIFORNIAN, Egyptian, and Fernando Po customs the worship of\r\nthe animal seems to have no relation to agriculture, and may\r\ntherefore be presumed to date from the hunting or pastoral stage of\r\nsociety. The same may be said of the following custom, though the\r\nZuni Indians of New Mexico, who practise it, are now settled in\r\nwalled villages or towns of a peculiar type, and practise\r\nagriculture and the arts of pottery and weaving. But the Zuni custom\r\nis marked by certain features which appear to place it in a somewhat\r\ndifferent class from the preceding cases. It may be well therefore\r\nto describe it at full length in the words of an eye-witness.\r\n\r\n"With midsummer the heat became intense. My brother [_i.e._ adopted\r\nIndian brother] and I sat, day after day, in the cool under-rooms of\r\nour house,--the latter [_sic_] busy with his quaint forge and crude\r\nappliances, working Mexican coins over into bangles, girdles,\r\near-rings, buttons, and what not, for savage ornament. Though his\r\ntools were wonderfully rude, the work he turned out by dint of\r\ncombined patience and ingenuity was remarkably beautiful. One day as\r\nI sat watching him, a procession of fifty men went hastily down the\r\nhill, and off westward over the plain. They were solemnly led by a\r\npainted and shell-bedecked priest, and followed by the torch-bearing\r\nShu-lu-wit-si or God of Fire. After they had vanished, I asked old\r\nbrother what it all meant.\r\n\r\n"\'They are going,\' said he, \'to the city of Ka-ka and the home of\r\nour others.\'\r\n\r\n"Four days after, towards sunset, costumed and masked in the\r\nbeautiful paraphernalia of the Ka-k\'ok-shi, or \'Good Dance,\' they\r\nreturned in file up the same pathway, each bearing in his arms a\r\nbasket filled with living, squirming turtles, which he regarded and\r\ncarried as tenderly as a mother would her infant. Some of the\r\nwretched reptiles were carefully wrapped in soft blankets, their\r\nheads and forefeet protruding,--and, mounted on the backs of the\r\nplume-bedecked pilgrims, made ludicrous but solemn caricatures of\r\nlittle children in the same position. While I was at supper upstairs\r\nthat evening, the governor\'s brother-in-law came in. He was welcomed\r\nby the family as if a messenger from heaven. He bore in his\r\ntremulous fingers one of the much abused and rebellious turtles.\r\nPaint still adhered to his hands and bare feet, which led me to\r\ninfer that he had formed one of the sacred embassy.\r\n\r\n"\'So you went to Ka-thlu-el-lon, did you?\' I asked.\r\n\r\n"\'E\'e,\' replied the weary man, in a voice husky with long chanting,\r\nas he sank, almost exhausted, on a roll of skins which had been\r\nplaced for him, and tenderly laid the turtle on the floor. No sooner\r\ndid the creature find itself at liberty than it made off as fast as\r\nits lame legs would take it. Of one accord, the family forsook dish,\r\nspoon, and drinking-cup, and grabbing from a sacred meal-bowl whole\r\nhandfuls of the contents, hurriedly followed the turtle about the\r\nroom, into dark corners, around water-jars, behind the\r\ngrinding-troughs, and out into the middle of the floor again,\r\npraying and scattering meal on its back as they went. At last,\r\nstrange to say, it approached the foot-sore man who had brought it.\r\n\r\n"\'Ha!\' he exclaimed with emotion; \'see it comes to me again; ah,\r\nwhat great favours the fathers of all grant me this day,\' and,\r\npassing his hand gently over the sprawling animal, he inhaled from\r\nhis palm deeply and long, at the same time invoking the favour of\r\nthe gods. Then he leaned his chin upon his hand, and with large,\r\nwistful eyes regarded his ugly captive as it sprawled about,\r\nblinking its meal-bedimmed eyes, and clawing the smooth floor in\r\nmemory of its native element. At this juncture I ventured a\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n"\'Why do you not let him go, or give him some water?\'\r\n\r\n"Slowly the man turned his eyes toward me, an odd mixture of pain,\r\nindignation, and pity on his face, while the worshipful family\r\nstared at me with holy horror.\r\n\r\n"\'Poor younger brother!\' he said at last, \'know you not how precious\r\nit is? It die? It will _not_ die; I tell you, it cannot die.\'\r\n\r\n"\'But it will die if you don\'t feed it and give it water.\'\r\n\r\n"\'I tell you it _cannot_ die; it will only change houses to-morrow,\r\nand go back to the home of its brothers. Ah, well! How should _you_\r\nknow?\' he mused. Turning to the blinded turtle again: \'Ah! my poor\r\ndear lost child or parent, my sister or brother to have been! Who\r\nknows which? Maybe my own great-grandfather or mother!\' And with\r\nthis he fell to weeping most pathetically, and, tremulous with sobs,\r\nwhich were echoed by the women and children, he buried his face in\r\nhis hands. Filled with sympathy for his grief, however mistaken, I\r\nraised the turtle to my lips and kissed its cold shell; then\r\ndepositing it on the floor, hastily left the grief-stricken family\r\nto their sorrows. Next day, with prayers and tender beseechings,\r\nplumes, and offerings, the poor turtle was killed, and its flesh and\r\nbones were removed and deposited in the little river, that it might\r\n\'return once more to eternal life among its comrades in the dark\r\nwaters of the lake of the dead.\' The shell, carefully scraped and\r\ndried, was made into a dance-rattle, and, covered by a piece of\r\nbuckskin, it still hangs from the smoke-stained rafters of my\r\nbrother\'s house. Once a Navajo tried to buy it for a ladle; loaded\r\nwith indignant reproaches, he was turned cut of the house. Were any\r\none to venture the suggestion that the turtle no longer lived, his\r\nremark would cause a flood of tears, and he would be reminded that\r\nit had only \'changed houses and gone to live for ever in the home of\r\n"our lost others."\'"\r\n\r\nIn this custom we find expressed in the clearest way a belief in the\r\ntransmigration of human souls into the bodies of turtles. The theory\r\nof transmigration is held by the Moqui Indians, who belong to the\r\nsame race as the Zunis. The Moquis are divided into totem clans--the\r\nBear clan, Deer clan, Wolf clan, Hare clan, and so on; they believe\r\nthat the ancestors of the clans were bears, deer, wolves, hares, and\r\nso forth; and that at death the members of each clan become bears,\r\ndeer, and so on according to the particular clan to which they\r\nbelonged. The Zuni are also divided into clans, the totems of which\r\nagree closely with those of the Moquis, and one of their totems is\r\nthe turtle. Thus their belief in transmigration into the turtle is\r\nprobably one of the regular articles of their totem faith. What then\r\nis the meaning of killing a turtle in which the soul of a kinsman is\r\nbelieved to be present? Apparently the object is to keep up a\r\ncommunication with the other world in which the souls of the\r\ndeparted are believed to be assembled in the form of turtles. It is\r\na common belief that the spirits of the dead return occasionally to\r\ntheir old homes; and accordingly the unseen visitors are welcomed\r\nand feasted by the living, and then sent upon their way. In the Zuni\r\nceremony the dead are fetched home in the form of turtles, and the\r\nkilling of the turtles is the way of sending back the souls to the\r\nspirit-land. Thus the general explanation given above of the custom\r\nof killing a god seems inapplicable to the Zuni custom, the true\r\nmeaning of which is somewhat obscure. Nor is the obscurity which\r\nhangs over the subject entirely dissipated by a later and fuller\r\naccount which we possess of the ceremony. From it we learn that the\r\nceremony forms part of the elaborate ritual which these Indians\r\nobserve at the midsummer solstice for the purpose of ensuring an\r\nabundant supply of rain for the crops. Envoys are despatched to\r\nbring "their otherselves, the tortoises," from the sacred lake\r\nKothluwalawa, to which the souls of the dead are believed to repair.\r\nWhen the creatures have thus been solemnly brought to Zuni, they are\r\nplaced in a bowl of water and dances are performed beside them by\r\nmen in costume, who personate gods and goddesses. "After the\r\nceremonial the tortoises are taken home by those who caught them and\r\nare hung by their necks to the rafters till morning, when they are\r\nthrown into pots of boiling water. The eggs are considered a great\r\ndelicacy. The meat is seldom touched except as a medicine, which is\r\ncurative for cutaneous diseases. Part of the meat is deposited in\r\nthe river with _k\xf3hakwa_ (white shell beads) and turquoise beads as\r\nofferings to Council of the Gods." This account at all events\r\nconfirms the inference that the tortoises are supposed to be\r\nreincarnations of the human dead, for they are called the\r\n"otherselves" of the Zuni; indeed, what else should they be than the\r\nsouls of the dead in the bodies of tortoises seeing that they come\r\nfrom the haunted lake? As the principal object of the prayers\r\nuttered and of the dances performed at these midsummer ceremonies\r\nappears to be to procure rain for the crops, it may be that the\r\nintention of bringing the tortoises to Zuni and dancing before them\r\nis to intercede with the ancestral spirit, incarnate in the animals,\r\nthat they may be pleased to exert their power over the waters of\r\nheaven for the benefit of their living descendants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Killing the Sacred Bear\r\n\r\nDOUBT also hangs at first sight over the meaning of the\r\nbear-sacrifice offered by the Aino or Ainu, a primitive people who\r\nare found in the Japanese island of Yezo or Yesso, as well as in\r\nSaghalien and the southern of the Kurile Islands. It is not quite\r\neasy to define the attitude of the Aino towards the bear. On the one\r\nhand they give it the name of _kamui_ or "god"; but as they apply\r\nthe same word to strangers, it may mean no more than a being\r\nsupposed to be endowed with superhuman, or at all events\r\nextraordinary, powers. Again, it is said that "the bear is their\r\nchief divinity"; "in the religion of the Aino the bear plays a chief\r\npart"; "amongst the animals it is especially the bear which receives\r\nan idolatrous veneration"; "they worship it after their fashion";\r\n"there is no doubt that this wild beast inspires more of the feeling\r\nwhich prompts worship than the inanimate forces of nature, and the\r\nAino may be distinguished as bear-worshippers." Yet, on the other\r\nhand, they kill the bear whenever they can; "in bygone years the\r\nAinu considered bear-hunting the most manly and useful way in which\r\na person could possibly spend his time"; "the men spend the autumn,\r\nwinter, and spring in hunting deer and bears. Part of their tribute\r\nor taxes is paid in skins, and they subsist on the dried meat";\r\nbear\'s flesh is indeed one of their staple foods; they eat it both\r\nfresh and salted; and the skins of bears furnish them with clothing.\r\nIn fact, the worship of which writers on this subject speak appears\r\nto be paid chiefly to the dead animal. Thus, although they kill a\r\nbear whenever they can, "in the process of dissecting the carcass\r\nthey endeavor to conciliate the deity, whose representative they\r\nhave slain, by making elaborate obeisances and deprecatory\r\nsalutations"; "when a bear has been killed the Ainu sit down and\r\nadmire it, make their salaams to it, worship it, and offer presents\r\nof _inao_"; "when a bear is trapped or wounded by an arrow, the\r\nhunters go through an apologetic or propitiatory ceremony." The\r\nskulls of slain bears receive a place of honour in their huts, or\r\nare set up on sacred posts outside the huts, and are treated with\r\nmuch respect: libations of millet beer, and of _sake,_ an\r\nintoxicating liquor, are offered to them; and they are addressed as\r\n"divine preservers" or "precious divinities." The skulls of foxes\r\nare also fastened to the sacred posts outside the huts; they are\r\nregarded as charms against evil spirits, and are consulted as\r\noracles. Yet it is expressly said, "The live fox is revered just as\r\nlittle as the bear; rather they avoid it as much as possible,\r\nconsidering it a wily animal." The bear can hardly, therefore, be\r\ndescribed as a sacred animal of the Aino, nor yet as a totem; for\r\nthey do not call themselves bears, and they kill and eat the animal\r\nfreely. However, they have a legend of a woman who had a son by a\r\nbear; and many of them who dwell in the mountains pride themselves\r\non being descended from a bear. Such people are called "Descendants\r\nof the bear" (_Kimun Kamui sanikiri_), and in the pride of their\r\nheart they will say, "As for me, I am a child of the god of the\r\nmountains; I am descended from the divine one who rules in the\r\nmountains," meaning by "the god of the mountains" no other than the\r\nbear. It is therefore possible that, as our principal authority, the\r\nRev. J. Batchelor, believes, the bear may have been the totem of an\r\nAino clan; but even if that were so it would not explain the respect\r\nshown for the animal by the whole Aino people.\r\n\r\nBut it is the bear-festival of the Aino which concerns us here.\r\nTowards the end of winter a bear cub is caught and brought into the\r\nvillage. If it is very small, it is suckled by an Aino woman, but\r\nshould there be no woman able to suckle it, the little animal is fed\r\nfrom the hand or the mouth. During the day it plays about in the hut\r\nwith the children and is treated with great affection. But when the\r\ncub grows big enough to pain people by hugging or scratching them,\r\nhe is shut up in a strong wooden cage, where he stays generally for\r\ntwo or three years, fed on fish and millet porridge, till it is time\r\nfor him to be killed and eaten. But "it is a peculiarly striking\r\nfact that the young bear is not kept merely to furnish a good meal;\r\nrather he is regarded and honoured as a fetish, or even as a sort of\r\nhigher being." In Yezo the festival is generally celebrated in\r\nSeptember or October. Before it takes place the Aino apologise to\r\ntheir gods, alleging that they have treated the bear kindly as long\r\nas they could, now they can feed him no longer, and are obliged to\r\nkill him. A man who gives a bear-feast invites his relations and\r\nfriends; in a small village nearly the whole community takes part in\r\nthe feast; indeed, guests from distant villages are invited and\r\ngenerally come, allured by the prospect of getting drunk for\r\nnothing. The form of invitation runs somewhat as follows: "I, so and\r\nso, am about to sacrifice the dear little divine thing who resides\r\namong the mountains. My friends and masters, come ye to the feast;\r\nwe will then unite in the great pleasure of sending the god away.\r\nCome." When all the people are assembled in front of the cage, an\r\norator chosen for the purpose addresses the bear and tells it that\r\nthey are about to send it forth to its ancestors. He craves pardon\r\nfor what they are about to do to it, hopes it will not be angry, and\r\ncomforts it by assuring the animal that many of the sacred whittled\r\nsticks (_inao_) and plenty of cakes and wine will be sent with it on\r\nthe long journey. One speech of this sort which Mr. Batchelor heard\r\nran as follows: "O thou divine one, thou wast sent into the world\r\nfor us to hunt. O thou precious little divinity, we worship thee;\r\npray hear our prayer. We have nourished thee and brought thee up\r\nwith a deal of pains and trouble, all because we love thee so. Now,\r\nas thou hast grown big, we are about to send thee to thy father and\r\nmother. When thou comest to them please speak well of us, and tell\r\nthem how kind we have been; please come to us again and we will\r\nsacrifice thee." Having been secured with ropes, the bear is then\r\nlet out of the cage and assailed with a shower of blunt arrows in\r\norder to arouse it to fury. When it has spent itself in vain\r\nstruggles, it is tied up to a stake, gagged and strangled, its neck\r\nbeing placed between two poles, which are then violently compressed,\r\nall the people eagerly helping to squeeze the animal to death. An\r\narrow is also discharged into the beast\'s heart by a good marksman,\r\nbut so as not to shed blood, for they think that it would be very\r\nunlucky if any of the blood were to drip on the ground. However, the\r\nmen sometimes drink the warm blood of the bear "that the courage and\r\nother virtues it possesses may pass into them"; and sometimes they\r\nbesmear themselves and their clothes with the blood in order to\r\nensure success in hunting. When the animal has been strangled to\r\ndeath, it is skinned and its head is cut off and set in the east\r\nwindow of the house, where a piece of its own flesh is placed under\r\nits snout, together with a cup of its own meat boiled, some millet\r\ndumplings, and dried fish. Prayers are then addressed to the dead\r\nanimal; amongst other things it is sometimes invited, after going\r\naway to its father and mother, to return into the world in order\r\nthat it may again be reared for sacrifice. When the bear is supposed\r\nto have finished eating its own flesh, the man who presides at the\r\nfeast takes the cup containing the boiled meat, salutes it, and\r\ndivides the contents between all the company present: every person,\r\nyoung and old alike, must taste a little. The cup is called "the cup\r\nof offering" because it has just been offered to the dead bear. When\r\nthe rest of the flesh has been cooked, it is shared out in like\r\nmanner among all the people, everybody partaking of at least a\r\nmorsel; not to partake of the feast would be equivalent to\r\nexcommunication, it would be to place the recreant outside the pale\r\nof Aino fellowship. Formerly every particle of the bear, except the\r\nbones, had to be eaten up at the banquet, but this rule is now\r\nrelaxed. The head, on being detached from the skin, is set up on a\r\nlong pole beside the sacred wands (_inao_) outside of the house,\r\nwhere it remains till nothing but the bare white skull is left.\r\nSkulls so set up are worshipped not only at the time of the\r\nfestival, but very often as long as they last. The Aino assured Mr.\r\nBatchelor that they really do believe the spirits of the worshipful\r\nanimals to reside in the skulls; that is why they address them as\r\n"divine preservers" and "precious divinities."\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of killing the bear was witnessed by Dr. B. Scheube on\r\nthe tenth of August at Kunnui, which is a village on Volcano Bay in\r\nthe island of Yezo or Yesso. As his description of the rite contains\r\nsome interesting particulars not mentioned in the foregoing account,\r\nit may be worth while to summarize it.\r\n\r\nOn entering the hut he found about thirty Aino present, men, women,\r\nand children, all dressed in their best. The master of the house\r\nfirst offered a libation on the fireplace to the god of the fire,\r\nand the guests followed his example. Then a libation was offered to\r\nthe house-god in his sacred corner of the hut. Meanwhile the\r\nhousewife, who had nursed the bear, sat by herself, silent and sad,\r\nbursting now and then into tears. Her grief was obviously\r\nunaffected, and it deepened as the festival went on. Next, the\r\nmaster of the house and some of the guests went out of the hut and\r\noffered libations before the bear\'s cage. A few drops were presented\r\nto the bear in a saucer, which he at once upset. Then the women and\r\ngirls danced round the cage, their faces turned towards it, their\r\nknees slightly bent, rising and hopping on their toes. As they\r\ndanced they clapped their hands and sang a monotonous song. The\r\nhousewife and a few old women, who might have nursed many bears,\r\ndanced tearfully, stretching out their arms to the bear, and\r\naddressing it in terms of endearment. The young folks were less\r\naffected; they laughed as well as sang. Disturbed by the noise, the\r\nbear began to rush about his cage and howl lamentably. Next\r\nlibations were offered at the _inao_ (_inabos_) or sacred wands\r\nwhich stand outside of an Aino hut. These wands are about a couple\r\nof feet high, and are whittled at the top into spiral shavings. Five\r\nnew wands with bamboo leaves attached to them had been set up for\r\nthe festival. This is regularly done when a bear is killed; the\r\nleaves mean that the animal may come to life again. Then the bear\r\nwas let out of his cage, a rope was thrown round his neck, and he\r\nwas led about in the neighbourhood of the hut. While this was being\r\ndone the men, headed by a chief, shot at the beast with arrows\r\ntipped with wooden buttons. Dr. Scheube had to do so also. Then the\r\nbear was taken before the sacred wands, a stick was put in his\r\nmouth, nine men knelt on him and pressed his neck against a beam. In\r\nfive minutes the animal had expired without uttering a sound.\r\nMeantime the women and girls had taken post behind the men, where\r\nthey danced, lamenting, and beating the men who were killing the\r\nbear. The bear\'s carcase was next placed on the mat before the\r\nsacred wands; and a sword and quiver, taken from the wands, were\r\nhung round the beast\'s neck. Being a she-bear, it was also adorned\r\nwith a necklace and ear-rings. Then food and drink were offered to\r\nit, in the shape of millet-broth, millet-cakes, and a pot of _sake._\r\nThe men now sat down on mats before the dead bear, offered libations\r\nto it, and drank deep. Meanwhile the women and girls had laid aside\r\nall marks of sorrow, and danced merrily, none more merrily than the\r\nold women. When the mirth was at its height two young Aino, who had\r\nlet the bear out of his cage, mounted the roof of the hut and threw\r\ncakes of millet among the company, who all scrambled for them\r\nwithout distinction of age or sex. The bear was next skinned and\r\ndisembowelled, and the trunk severed from the head, to which the\r\nskin was left hanging. The blood, caught in cups, was eagerly\r\nswallowed by the men. None of the women or children appeared to\r\ndrink the blood, though custom did not forbid them to do so. The\r\nliver was cut in small pieces and eaten raw, with salt, the women\r\nand children getting their share. The flesh and the rest of the\r\nvitals were taken into the house to be kept till the next day but\r\none, and then to be divided among the persons who had been present\r\nat the feast. Blood and liver were offered to Dr. Scheube. While the\r\nbear was being disembowelled, the women and girls danced the same\r\ndance which they had danced at the beginning--not, however, round\r\nthe cage, but in front of the sacred wands. At this dance the old\r\nwomen, who had been merry a moment before, again shed tears freely.\r\nAfter the brain had been extracted from the bear\'s head and\r\nswallowed with salt, the skull, detached from the skin, was hung on\r\na pole beside the sacred wands. The stick with which the bear had\r\nbeen gagged was also fastened to the pole, and so were the sword and\r\nquiver which had been hung on the carcase. The latter were removed\r\nin about an hour, but the rest remained standing. The whole company,\r\nmen and women, danced noisily before the pole; and another\r\ndrinking-bout, in which the women joined, closed the festival.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first published account of the bear-feast of the Aino is\r\none which was given to the world by a Japanese writer in 1652. It\r\nhas been translated into French and runs thus: "When they find a\r\nyoung bear, they bring it home, and the wife suckles it. When it is\r\ngrown they feed it with fish and fowl and kill it in winter for the\r\nsake of the liver, which they esteem an antidote to poison, the\r\nworms, colic, and disorders of the stomach. It is of a very bitter\r\ntaste, and is good for nothing if the bear has been killed in\r\nsummer. This butchery begins in the first Japanese month. For this\r\npurpose they put the animal\'s head between two long poles, which are\r\nsqueezed together by fifty or sixty people, both men and women. When\r\nthe bear is dead they eat his flesh, keep the liver as a medicine,\r\nand sell the skin, which is black and commonly six feet long, but\r\nthe longest measure twelve feet. As soon as he is skinned, the\r\npersons who nourished the beast begin to bewail him; afterwards they\r\nmake little cakes to regale those who helped them."\r\n\r\nThe Aino of Saghalien rear bear cubs and kill them with similar\r\nceremonies. We are told that they do not look upon the bear as a god\r\nbut only as a messenger whom they despatch with various commissions\r\nto the god of the forest. The animal is kept for about two years in\r\na cage, and then killed at a festival, which always takes place in\r\nwinter and at night. The day before the sacrifice is devoted to\r\nlamentation, old women relieving each other in the duty of weeping\r\nand groaning in front of the bear\'s cage. Then about the middle of\r\nthe night or very early in the morning an orator makes a long speech\r\nto the beast, reminding him how they have taken care of him, and fed\r\nhim well, and bathed him in the river, and made him warm and\r\ncomfortable. "Now," he proceeds, "we are holding a great festival in\r\nyour honour. Be not afraid. We will not hurt you. We will only kill\r\nyou and send you to the god of the forest who loves you. We are\r\nabout to offer you a good dinner, the best you have ever eaten among\r\nus, and we will all weep for you together. The Aino who will kill\r\nyou is the best shot among us. There he is, he weeps and asks your\r\nforgiveness; you will feel almost nothing, it will be done so\r\nquickly. We cannot feed you always, as you will understand. We have\r\ndone enough for you; it is now your turn to sacrifice yourself for\r\nus. You will ask God to send us, for the winter, plenty of otters\r\nand sables, and for the summer, seals and fish in abundance. Do not\r\nforget our messages, we love you much, and our children will never\r\nforget you." When the bear has partaken of his last meal amid the\r\ngeneral emotion of the spectators, the old women weeping afresh and\r\nthe men uttering stifled cries, he is strapped, not without\r\ndifficulty and danger, and being let out of the cage is led on leash\r\nor dragged, according to the state of his temper, thrice round his\r\ncage, then round his master\'s house, and lastly round the house of\r\nthe orator. Thereupon he is tied up to a tree, which is decked with\r\nsacred whittled sticks (_inao_) of the usual sort; and the orator\r\nagain addresses him in a long harangue, which sometimes lasts till\r\nthe day is beginning to break. "Remember," he cries, "remember! I\r\nremind you of your whole life and of the services we have rendered\r\nyou. It is now for you to do your duty. Do not forget what I have\r\nasked of you. You will tell the gods to give us riches, that our\r\nhunters may return from the forest laden with rare furs and animals\r\ngood to eat; that our fishers may find troops of seals on the shore\r\nand in the sea, and that their nets may crack under the weight of\r\nthe fish. We have no hope but in you. The evil spirits laugh at us,\r\nand too often they are unfavourable and malignant to us, but they\r\nwill bow before you. We have given you food and joy and health; now\r\nwe kill you in order that you may in return send riches to us and to\r\nour children." To this discourse the bear, more and more surly and\r\nagitated, listens without conviction; round and round the tree he\r\npaces and howls lamentably, till, just as the first beams of the\r\nrising sun light up the scene, an archer speeds an arrow to his\r\nheart. No sooner has he done so, than the marksman throws away his\r\nbow and flings himself on the ground, and the old men and women do\r\nthe same, weeping and sobbing. Then they offer the dead beast a\r\nrepast of rice and wild potatoes, and having spoken to him in terms\r\nof pity and thanked him for what he has done and suffered, they cut\r\noff his head and paws and keep them as sacred things. A banquet on\r\nthe flesh and blood of the bear follows. Women were formerly\r\nexcluded from it, but now they share with the men. The blood is\r\ndrunk warm by all present; the flesh is boiled, custom forbids it to\r\nbe roasted. And as the relics of the bear may not enter the house by\r\nthe door, and Aino houses in Saghalien have no windows, a man gets\r\nup on the roof and lets the flesh, the head, and the skin down\r\nthrough the smoke-hole. Rice and wild potatoes are then offered to\r\nthe head, and a pipe, tobacco, and matches are considerately placed\r\nbeside it. Custom requires that the guests should eat up the whole\r\nanimal before they depart; the use of salt and pepper at the meal is\r\nforbidden; and no morsel of the flesh may be given to the dogs. When\r\nthe banquet is over, the head is carried away into the depth of the\r\nforest and deposited on a heap of bears\' skulls, the bleached and\r\nmouldering relics of similar festivals in the past.\r\n\r\nThe Gilyaks, a Tunguzian people of Eastern Siberia, hold a\r\nbear-festival of the same sort once a year in January. "The bear is\r\nthe object of the most refined solicitude of an entire village and\r\nplays the chief part in their religious ceremonies." An old she-bear\r\nis shot and her cub is reared, but not suckled, in the village. When\r\nthe bear is big enough he is taken from his cage and dragged through\r\nthe village. But first they lead him to the bank of the river, for\r\nthis is believed to ensure abundance of fish to each family. He is\r\nthen taken into every house in the village, where fish, brandy, and\r\nso forth are offered to him. Some people prostrate themselves before\r\nthe beast. His entrance into a house is supposed to bring a\r\nblessing; and if he snuffs at the food offered to him, this also is\r\na blessing. Nevertheless they tease and worry, poke and tickle the\r\nanimal continually, so that he is surly and snappish. After being\r\nthus taken to every house, he is tied to a peg and shot dead with\r\narrows. His head is then cut off, decked with shavings, and placed\r\non the table where the feast is set out. Here they beg pardon of the\r\nbeast and worship him. Then his flesh is roasted and eaten in\r\nspecial vessels of wood finely carved. They do not eat the flesh raw\r\nnor drink the blood, as the Aino do. The brain and entrails are\r\neaten last; and the skull, still decked with shavings, is placed on\r\na tree near the house. Then the people sing and both sexes dance in\r\nranks, as bears.\r\n\r\nOne of these bear-festivals was witnessed by the Russian traveller\r\nL. von Schrenck and his companions at the Gilyak village of Tebach\r\nin January 1856. From his detailed report of the ceremony we may\r\ngather some particulars which are not noticed in the briefer\r\naccounts which I have just summarised. The bear, he tells us, plays\r\na great part in the life of all the peoples inhabiting the region of\r\nthe Amoor and Siberia as far as Kamtchatka, but among none of them\r\nis his importance greater than among the Gilyaks. The immense size\r\nwhich the animal attains in the valley of the Amoor, his ferocity\r\nwhetted by hunger, and the frequency of his appearance, all combine\r\nto make him the most dreaded beast of prey in the country. No\r\nwonder, therefore, that the fancy of the Gilyaks is busied with him\r\nand surrounds him, both in life and in death, with a sort of halo of\r\nsuperstitious fear. Thus, for example, it is thought that if a\r\nGilyak falls in combat with a bear, his soul transmigrates into the\r\nbody of the beast. Nevertheless his flesh has an irresistible\r\nattraction for the Gilyak palate, especially when the animal has\r\nbeen kept in captivity for some time and fattened on fish, which\r\ngives the flesh, in the opinion of the Gilyaks, a peculiarly\r\ndelicious flavour. But in order to enjoy this dainty with impunity\r\nthey deem it needful to perform a long series of ceremonies, of\r\nwhich the intention is to delude the living bear by a show of\r\nrespect, and to appease the anger of the dead animal by the homage\r\npaid to his departed spirit. The marks of respect begin as soon as\r\nthe beast is captured. He is brought home in triumph and kept in a\r\ncage, where all the villagers take it in turns to feed him. For\r\nalthough he may have been captured or purchased by one man, he\r\nbelongs in a manner to the whole village. His flesh will furnish a\r\ncommon feast, and hence all must contribute to support him in his\r\nlife. The length of time he is kept in captivity depends on his age.\r\nOld bears are kept only a few months; cubs are kept till they are\r\nfull-grown. A thick layer of fat on the captive bear gives the\r\nsignal for the festival, which is always held in winter, generally\r\nin December but sometimes in January or February. At the festival\r\nwitnessed by the Russian travellers, which lasted a good many days,\r\nthree bears were killed and eaten. More than once the animals were\r\nled about in procession and compelled to enter every house in the\r\nvillage, where they were fed as a mark of honour, and to show that\r\nthey were welcome guests. But before the beasts set out on this\r\nround of visits, the Gilyaks played at skipping-rope in presence,\r\nand perhaps, as L. von Schrenck inclined to believe, in honour of\r\nthe animals. The night before they were killed, the three bears were\r\nled by moonlight a long way on the ice of the frozen river. That\r\nnight no one in the village might sleep. Next day, after the animals\r\nhad been again led down the steep bank to the river, and conducted\r\nthrice round the hole in the ice from which the women of the village\r\ndrew their water, they were taken to an appointed place not far from\r\nthe village, and shot to death with arrows. The place of sacrifice\r\nor execution was marked as holy by being surrounded with whittled\r\nsticks, from the tops of which shavings hung in curls. Such sticks\r\nare with the Gilyaks, as with the Aino, the regular symbols that\r\naccompany all religious ceremonies.\r\n\r\nWhen the house has been arranged and decorated for their reception,\r\nthe skins of the bears, with their heads attached to them, are\r\nbrought into it, not, however, by the door, but through a window,\r\nand then hung on a sort of scaffold opposite the hearth on which the\r\nflesh is to be cooked. The boiling of the bears\' flesh among the\r\nGilyaks is done only by the oldest men, whose high privilege it is;\r\nwomen and children, young men and boys have no part in it. The task\r\nis performed slowly and deliberately, with a certain solemnity. On\r\nthe occasion described by the Russian travellers the kettle was\r\nfirst of all surrounded with a thick wreath of shavings, and then\r\nfilled with snow, for the use of water to cook bear\'s flesh is\r\nforbidden. Meanwhile a large wooden trough, richly adorned with\r\narabesques and carvings of all sorts, was hung immediately under the\r\nsnouts of the bears; on one side of the trough was carved in relief\r\na bear, on the other side a toad. When the carcases were being cut\r\nup, each leg was laid on the ground in front of the bears, as if to\r\nask their leave, before being placed in the kettle; and the boiled\r\nflesh was fished out of the kettle with an iron hook, and set in the\r\ntrough before the bears, in order that they might be the first to\r\ntaste of their own flesh. As fast, too, as the fat was cut in strips\r\nit was hung up in front of the bears, and afterwards laid in a small\r\nwooden trough on the ground before them. Last of all the inner\r\norgans of the beasts were cut up and placed in small vessels. At the\r\nsame time the women made bandages out of parti-coloured rags, and\r\nafter sunset these bandages were tied round the bears\' snouts just\r\nbelow the eyes "in order to dry the tears that flowed from them."\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ceremony of wiping away poor bruin\'s tears had been\r\nperformed, the assembled Gilyaks set to work in earnest to devour\r\nhis flesh. The broth obtained by boiling the meat had already been\r\npartaken of. The wooden bowls, platters, and spoons out of which the\r\nGilyaks eat the broth and flesh of the bears on these occasions are\r\nalways made specially for the purpose at the festival and only then;\r\nthey are elaborately ornamented with carved figures of bears and\r\nother devices that refer to the animal or the festival, and the\r\npeople have a strong superstitious scruple against parting with\r\nthem. After the bones had been picked clean they were put back in\r\nthe kettle in which the flesh had been boiled. And when the festal\r\nmeal was over, an old man took his stand at the door of the house\r\nwith a branch of fir in his hand, with which, as the people passed\r\nout, he gave a light blow to every one who had eaten of the bear\'s\r\nflesh or fat, perhaps as a punishment for their treatment of the\r\nworshipful animal. In the afternoon the women performed a strange\r\ndance. Only one woman danced at a time, throwing the upper part of\r\nher body into the oddest postures, while she held in her hands a\r\nbranch of fir or a kind of wooden castanets. The other women\r\nmeanwhile played an accompaniment by drumming on the beams of the\r\nhouse with clubs. Von Schrenk believed that after the flesh of the\r\nbear has been eaten the bones and the skull are solemnly carried out\r\nby the oldest people to a place in the forest not far from the\r\nvillage. There all the bones except the skull are buried. After that\r\na young tree is felled a few inches above the ground, its stump\r\ncleft, and the skull wedged into the cleft. When the grass grows\r\nover the spot, the skull disappears from view, and that is the end\r\nof the bear.\r\n\r\nAnother description of the bear-festivals of the Gilyaks has been\r\ngiven us by Mr. Leo Sternberg. It agrees substantially with the\r\nforegoing accounts, but a few particulars in it may be noted.\r\nAccording to Mr. Sternberg, the festival is usually held in honour\r\nof a deceased relation: the next of kin either buys or catches a\r\nbear cub and nurtures it for two or three years till it is ready for\r\nthe sacrifice. Only certain distinguished guests (_Narch-en_) are\r\nprivileged to partake of the bear\'s flesh, but the host and members\r\nof his clan eat a broth made from the flesh; great quantities of\r\nthis broth are prepared and consumed on the occasion. The guests of\r\nhonour (_Narch-en_) must belong to the clan into which the host\'s\r\ndaughters and the other women of his clan are married: one of these\r\nguests, usually the host\'s son-in-law, is entrusted with the duty of\r\nshooting the bear dead with an arrow. The skin, head, and flesh of\r\nthe slain bear are brought into the house not through the door but\r\nthrough the smoke-hole; a quiver full of arrows is laid under the\r\nhead and beside it are deposited tobacco, sugar, and other food. The\r\nsoul of the bear is supposed to carry off the souls of these things\r\nwith it on the far journey. A special vessel is used for cooking the\r\nbear\'s flesh, and the fire must be kindled by a sacred apparatus of\r\nflint and steel, which belongs to the clan and is handed down from\r\ngeneration to generation, but which is never used to light fires\r\nexcept on these solemn occasions. Of all the many viands cooked for\r\nthe consumption of the assembled people a portion is placed in a\r\nspecial vessel and set before the bear\'s head: this is called\r\n"feeding the head." After the bear has been killed, dogs are\r\nsacrificed in couples of male and female. Before being throttled,\r\nthey are fed and invited to go to their lord on the highest\r\nmountain, to change their skins, and to return next year in the form\r\nof bears. The soul of the dead bear departs to the same lord, who is\r\nalso lord of the primaeval forest; it goes away laden with the\r\nofferings that have been made to it, and attended by the souls of\r\nthe dogs and also by the souls of the sacred whittled sticks, which\r\nfigure prominently at the festival.\r\n\r\nThe Goldi, neighbours of the Gilyaks, treat the bear in much the\r\nsame way. They hunt and kill it; but sometimes they capture a live\r\nbear and keep him in a cage, feeding him well and calling him their\r\nson and brother. Then at a great festival he is taken from his cage,\r\nparaded about with marked consideration, and afterwards killed and\r\neaten. "The skull, jaw-bones, and ears are then suspended on a tree,\r\nas an antidote against evil spirits; but the flesh is eaten and much\r\nrelished, for they believe that all who partake of it acquire a zest\r\nfor the chase, and become courageous."\r\n\r\nThe Orotchis, another Tunguzian people of the region of the Amoor,\r\nhold bear-festivals of the same general character. Any one who\r\ncatches a bear cub considers it his bounden duty to rear it in a\r\ncage for about three years, in order at the end of that time to kill\r\nit publicly and eat the flesh with his friends. The feasts being\r\npublic, though organised by individuals, the people try to have one\r\nin each Orotchi village every year in turn. When the bear is taken\r\nout of his cage, he is led about by means of ropes to all the huts,\r\naccompanied by people armed with lances, bows, and arrows. At each\r\nhut the bear and bear-leaders are treated to something good to eat\r\nand drink. This goes on for several days until all the huts, not\r\nonly in that village but also in the next, have been visited. The\r\ndays are given up to sport and noisy jollity. Then the bear is tied\r\nto a tree or wooden pillar and shot to death by the arrows of the\r\ncrowd, after which its flesh is roasted and eaten. Among the\r\nOrotchis of the Tundja River women take part in the bear-feasts,\r\nwhile among the Orotchis of the River Vi the women will not even\r\ntouch bear\'s flesh.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of the captive bear by these tribes there are\r\nfeatures which can hardly be distinguished from worship. Such, for\r\nexample, are the prayers offered to it both alive and dead; the\r\nofferings of food, including portions of its own flesh, laid before\r\nthe animal\'s skull; and the Gilyak custom of leading the living\r\nbeast to the river in order to ensure a supply of fish, and of\r\nconducting him from house to house in order that every family may\r\nreceive his blessing, just as in Europe a May-tree or a personal\r\nrepresentative of the tree-spirit used to be taken from door to door\r\nin spring for the sake of diffusing among all and sundry the fresh\r\nenergies of reviving nature. Again, the solemn participation in his\r\nflesh and blood, and particularly the Aino custom of sharing the\r\ncontents of the cup which had been consecrated by being set before\r\nthe dead beast, are strongly suggestive of a sacrament, and the\r\nsuggestion is confirmed by the Gilyak practice of reserving special\r\nvessels to hold the flesh and cooking it on a fire kindled by a\r\nsacred apparatus which is never employed except on these religious\r\noccasions. Indeed our principal authority on Aino religion, the Rev.\r\nJohn Batchelor, frankly describes as worship the ceremonious respect\r\nwhich the Aino pay to the bear, and he affirms that the animal is\r\nundoubtedly one of their gods. Certainly the Aino appear to apply\r\ntheir name for god (_kamui_) freely to the bear; but, as Mr.\r\nBatchelor himself points out, that word is used with many different\r\nshades of meaning and is applied to a great variety of objects, so\r\nthat from its application to the bear we cannot safely argue that\r\nthe animal is actually regarded as a deity. Indeed we are expressly\r\ntold that the Aino of Saghalien do not consider the bear to be a god\r\nbut only a messenger to the gods, and the message with which they\r\ncharge the animal at its death bears out the statement. Apparently\r\nthe Gilyaks also look on the bear in the light of an envoy\r\ndespatched with presents to the Lord of the Mountain, on whom the\r\nwelfare of the people depends. At the same time they treat the\r\nanimal as a being of a higher order than man, in fact as a minor\r\ndeity, whose presence in the village, so long as he is kept and fed,\r\ndiffuses blessings, especially by keeping at bay the swarms of evil\r\nspirits who are constantly lying in wait for people, stealing their\r\ngoods and destroying their bodies by sickness and disease. Moreover,\r\nby partaking of the flesh, blood, or broth of the bear, the Gilyaks,\r\nthe Aino, and the Goldi are all of opinion that they acquire some\r\nportion of the animal\'s mighty powers, particularly his courage and\r\nstrength. No wonder, therefore, that they should treat so great a\r\nbenefactor with marks of the highest respect and affection.\r\n\r\nSome light may be thrown on the ambiguous attitude of the Aino to\r\nbears by comparing the similar treatment which they accord to other\r\ncreatures. For example, they regard the eagle-owl as a good deity\r\nwho by his hooting warns men of threatened evil and defends them\r\nagainst it; hence he is loved, trusted, and devoutly worshipped as a\r\ndivine mediator between men and the Creator. The various names\r\napplied to him are significant both of his divinity and of his\r\nmediatorship. Whenever an opportunity offers, one of these divine\r\nbirds is captured and kept in a cage, where he is greeted with the\r\nendearing titles of "Beloved god" and "Dear little divinity."\r\nNevertheless the time comes when the dear little divinity is\r\nthrottled and sent away in his capacity of mediator to take a\r\nmessage to the superior gods or to the Creator himself. The\r\nfollowing is the form of prayer addressed to the eagle-owl when it\r\nis about to be sacrificed: "Beloved deity, we have brought you up\r\nbecause we loved you, and now we are about to send you to your\r\nfather. We herewith offer you food, _inao,_ wine, and cakes; take\r\nthem to your parent, and he will be very pleased. When you come to\r\nhim say, \'I have lived a long time among the Ainu, where an Ainu\r\nfather and an Ainu mother reared me. I now come to thee. I have\r\nbrought a variety of good things. I saw while living in Ainuland a\r\ngreat deal of distress. I observed that some of the people were\r\npossessed by demons, some were wounded by wild animals, some were\r\nhurt by landslides, others suffered shipwreck, and many were\r\nattacked by disease. The people are in great straits. My father,\r\nhear me, and hasten to look upon the Ainu and help them.\' If you do\r\nthis, your father will help us."\r\n\r\nAgain, the Aino keep eagles in cages, worship them as divinities,\r\nand ask them to defend the people from evil. Yet they offer the bird\r\nin sacrifice, and when they are about to do so they pray to him,\r\nsaying: "O precious divinity, O thou divine bird, pray listen to my\r\nwords. Thou dost not belong to this world, for thy home is with the\r\nCreator and his golden eagles. This being so, I present thee with\r\nthese _inao_ and cakes and other precious things. Do thou ride upon\r\nthe _inao_ and ascend to thy home in the glorious heavens. When thou\r\narrivest, assemble the deities of thy own kind together and thank\r\nthem for us for having governed the world. Do thou come again, I\r\nbeseech thee, and rule over us. O my precious one, go thou quietly."\r\nOnce more, the Aino revere hawks, keep them in cages, and offer them\r\nin sacrifice. At the time of killing one of them the following\r\nprayer should be addressed to the bird: "O divine hawk, thou art an\r\nexpert hunter, please cause thy cleverness to descend on me." If a\r\nhawk is well treated in captivity and prayed to after this fashion\r\nwhen he is about to be killed, he will surely send help to the\r\nhunter.\r\n\r\nThus the Aino hopes to profit in various ways by slaughtering the\r\ncreatures, which, nevertheless, he treats as divine. He expects them\r\nto carry messages for him to their kindred or to the gods in the\r\nupper world; he hopes to partake of their virtues by swallowing\r\nparts of their bodies or in other ways; and apparently he looks\r\nforward to their bodily resurrection in this world, which will\r\nenable him again to catch and kill them, and again to reap all the\r\nbenefits which he has already derived from their slaughter. For in\r\nthe prayers addressed to the worshipful bear and the worshipful\r\neagle before they are knocked on the head the creatures are invited\r\nto come again, which seems clearly to point to a faith in their\r\nfuture resurrection. If any doubt could exist on this head, it would\r\nbe dispelled by the evidence of Mr. Batchelor, who tells us that the\r\nAino "are firmly convinced that the spirits of birds and animals\r\nkilled in hunting or offered in sacrifice come and live again upon\r\nthe earth clothed with a body; and they believe, further, that they\r\nappear here for the special benefit of men, particularly Ainu\r\nhunters." The Aino, Mr. Batchelor tells us, "confessedly slays and\r\neats the beast that another may come in its place and be treated in\r\nlike manner"; and at the time of sacrificing the creatures "prayers\r\nare said to them which form a request that they will come again and\r\nfurnish viands for another feast, as if it were an honour to them to\r\nbe thus killed and eaten, and a pleasure as well. Indeed such is the\r\npeople\'s idea." These last observations, as the context shows, refer\r\nespecially to the sacrifice of bears.\r\n\r\nThus among the benefits which the Aino anticipates from the\r\nslaughter of the worshipful animals not the least substantial is\r\nthat of gorging himself on their flesh and blood, both on the\r\npresent and on many a similar occasion hereafter; and that pleasing\r\nprospect again is derived from his firm faith in the spiritual\r\nimmortality and bodily resurrection of the dead animals. A like\r\nfaith is shared by many savage hunters in many parts of the world\r\nand has given rise to a variety of quaint customs, some of which\r\nwill be described presently. Meantime it is not unimportant to\r\nobserve that the solemn festivals at which the Aino, the Gilyaks,\r\nand other tribes slaughter the tame caged bears with demonstrations\r\nof respect and sorrow, are probably nothing but an extension or\r\nglorification of similar rites which the hunter performs over any\r\nwild bear which he chances to kill in the forest. Indeed with regard\r\nto the Gilyaks we are expressly informed that this is the case. If\r\nwe would understand the meaning of the Gilyak ritual, says Mr.\r\nSternberg, "we must above all remember that the bear-festivals are\r\nnot, as is usually but falsely assumed, celebrated only at the\r\nkilling of a house-bear but are held on every occasion when a Gilyak\r\nsucceeds in slaughtering a bear in the chase. It is true that in\r\nsuch cases the festival assumes less imposing dimensions, but in its\r\nessence it remains the same. When the head and skin of a bear killed\r\nin the forest are brought into the village, they are accorded a\r\ntriumphal reception with music and solemn ceremonial. The head is\r\nlaid on a consecrated scaffold, fed, and treated with offerings,\r\njust as at the killing of a house-bear; and the guests of honour\r\n(_Narch-en_) are also assembled. So, too, dogs are sacrificed, and\r\nthe bones of the bear are preserved in the same place and with the\r\nsame marks of respect as the bones of a house-bear. Hence the great\r\nwinter festival is only an extension of the rite which is observed\r\nat the slaughter of every bear."\r\n\r\nThus the apparent contradiction in the practice of these tribes, who\r\nvenerate and almost deify the animals which they habitually hunt,\r\nkill, and eat, is not so flagrant as at first sight it appears to\r\nus: the people have reasons, and some very practical reasons, for\r\nacting as they do. For the savage is by no means so illogical and\r\nunpractical as to superficial observers he is apt to seem; he has\r\nthought deeply on the questions which immediately concern him, he\r\nreasons about them, and though his conclusions often diverge very\r\nwidely from ours, we ought not to deny him the credit of patient and\r\nprolonged meditation on some fundamental problems of human\r\nexistence. In the present case, if he treats bears in general as\r\ncreatures wholly subservient to human needs and yet singles out\r\ncertain individuals of the species for homage which almost amounts\r\nto deification, we must not hastily set him down as irrational and\r\ninconsistent, but must endeavour to place ourselves at his point of\r\nview, to see things as he sees them, and to divest ourselves of the\r\nprepossessions which tinge so deeply our own views of the world. If\r\nwe do so, we shall probably discover that, however absurd his\r\nconduct may appear to us, the savage nevertheless generally acts on\r\na train of reasoning which seems to him in harmony with the facts of\r\nhis limited experience. This I propose to illustrate in the\r\nfollowing chapter, where I shall attempt to show that the solemn\r\nceremonial of the bear-festival among the Ainos and other tribes of\r\nNorth-eastern Asia is only a particularly striking example of the\r\nrespect which on the principles of his rude philosophy the savage\r\nhabitually pays to the animals which he kills and eats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIII. The Propitiation of Wild Animals By Hunters\r\n\r\nTHE EXPLANATION of life by the theory of an indwelling and\r\npractically immortal soul is one which the savage does not confine\r\nto human beings but extends to the animate creation in general. In\r\nso doing he is more liberal and perhaps more logical than the\r\ncivilised man, who commonly denies to animals that privilege of\r\nimmortality which he claims for himself. The savage is not so proud;\r\nhe commonly believes that animals are endowed with feelings and\r\nintelligence like those of men, and that, like men, they possess\r\nsouls which survive the death of their bodies either to wander about\r\nas disembodied spirits or to be born again in animal form.\r\n\r\nThus to the savage, who regards all living creatures as practically\r\non a footing of equality with man, the act of killing and eating an\r\nanimal must wear a very different aspect from that which the same\r\nact presents to us, who regard the intelligence of animals as far\r\ninferior to our own and deny them the possession of immortal souls.\r\nHence on the principles of his rude philosophy the primitive hunter\r\nwho slays an animal believes himself exposed to the vengeance either\r\nof its disembodied spirit or of all the other animals of the same\r\nspecies, whom he considers as knit together, like men, by the ties\r\nof kin and the obligations of the blood feud, and therefore as bound\r\nto resent the injury done to one of their number. Accordingly the\r\nsavage makes it a rule to spare the life of those animals which he\r\nhas no pressing motive for killing, at least such fierce and\r\ndangerous animals as are likely to exact a bloody vengeance for the\r\nslaughter of one of their kind. Crocodiles are animals of this sort.\r\nThey are only found in hot countries, where, as a rule, food is\r\nabundant and primitive man has therefore little reason to kill them\r\nfor the sake of their tough and unpalatable flesh. Hence it is a\r\ncustom with some savages to spare crocodiles, or rather only to kill\r\nthem in obedience to the law of blood feud, that is, as a\r\nretaliation for the slaughter of men by crocodiles. For example, the\r\nDyaks of Borneo will not kill a crocodile unless a crocodile has\r\nfirst killed a man. "For why, say they, should they commit an act of\r\naggression, when he and his kindred can so easily repay them? But\r\nshould the alligator take a human life, revenge becomes a sacred\r\nduty of the living relatives, who will trap the man-eater in the\r\nspirit of an officer of justice pursuing a criminal. Others, even\r\nthen, hang back, reluctant to embroil themselves in a quarrel which\r\ndoes not concern them. The man-eating alligator is supposed to be\r\npursued by a righteous Nemesis; and whenever one is caught they have\r\na profound conviction that it must be the guilty one, or his\r\naccomplice."\r\n\r\nLike the Dyaks, the natives of Madagascar never kill a crocodile\r\n"except in retaliation for one of their friends who has been\r\ndestroyed by a crocodile. They believe that the wanton destruction\r\nof one of these reptiles will be followed by the loss of human life,\r\nin accordance with the principle of _lex talionis._" The people who\r\nlive near the lake Itasy in Madagascar make a yearly proclamation to\r\nthe crocodiles, announcing that they will revenge the death of some\r\nof their friends by killing as many crocodiles in return, and\r\nwarning all well-disposed crocodiles to keep out of the way, as they\r\nhave no quarrel with them, but only with their evil-minded relations\r\nwho have taken human life. Various tribes of Madagascar believe\r\nthemselves to be descended from crocodiles, and accordingly they\r\nview the scaly reptile as, to all intents and purposes, a man and a\r\nbrother. If one of the animals should so far forget himself as to\r\ndevour one of his human kinsfolk, the chief of the tribe, or in his\r\nabsence an old man familiar with the tribal customs, repairs at the\r\nhead of the people to the edge of the water, and summons the family\r\nof the culprit to deliver him up to the arm of justice. A hook is\r\nthen baited and cast into the river or lake. Next day the guilty\r\nbrother, or one of his family, is dragged ashore, and after his\r\ncrime has been clearly brought home to him by a strict\r\ninterrogation, he is sentenced to death and executed. The claims of\r\njustice being thus satisfied and the majesty of the law fully\r\nvindicated, the deceased crocodile is lamented and buried like a\r\nkinsman; a mound is raised over his relics and a stone marks the\r\nplace of his head.\r\n\r\nAgain, the tiger is another of those dangerous beasts whom the\r\nsavage prefers to leave alone, lest by killing one of the species he\r\nshould excite the hostility of the rest. No consideration will\r\ninduce a Sumatran to catch or wound a tiger except in self-defence\r\nor immediately after a tiger has destroyed a friend or relation.\r\nWhen a European has set traps for tigers, the people of the\r\nneighbourhood have been known to go by night to the place and\r\nexplain to the animals that the traps are not set by them nor with\r\ntheir consent. The inhabitants of the hills near Rajamahall, in\r\nBengal, are very averse to killing a tiger, unless one of their\r\nkinsfolk has been carried off by one of the beasts. In that case\r\nthey go out for the purpose of hunting and slaying a tiger; and when\r\nthey have succeeded they lay their bows and arrows on the carcase\r\nand invoke God, declaring that they slew the animal in retaliation\r\nfor the loss of a kinsman. Vengeance having been thus taken, they\r\nswear not to attack another tiger except under similar provocation.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of Carolina would not molest snakes when they came upon\r\nthem, but would pass by on the other side of the path, believing\r\nthat if they were to kill a serpent, the reptile\'s kindred would\r\ndestroy some of their brethren, friends, or relations in return. So\r\nthe Seminole Indians spared the rattlesnake, because they feared\r\nthat the soul of the dead rattlesnake would incite its kinsfolk to\r\ntake vengeance. The Cherokee regard the rattlesnake as the chief of\r\nthe snake tribe and fear and respect him accordingly. Few Cherokee\r\nwill venture to kill a rattlesnake, unless they cannot help it, and\r\neven then they must atone for the crime by craving pardon of the\r\nsnake\'s ghost either in their own person or through the mediation of\r\na priest, according to a set formula. If these precautions are\r\nneglected, the kinsfolk of the dead snake will send one of their\r\nnumber as an avenger of blood, who will track down the murderer and\r\nsting him to death. No ordinary Cherokee dares to kill a wolf, if he\r\ncan possibly help it; for he believes that the kindred of the slain\r\nbeast would surely avenge its death, and that the weapon with which\r\nthe deed had been done would be quite useless for the future, unless\r\nit were cleaned and exorcised by a medicine-man. However, certain\r\npersons who know the proper rites of atonement for such a crime can\r\nkill wolves with impunity, and they are sometimes hired to do so by\r\npeople who have suffered from the raids of the wolves on their\r\ncattle or fish-traps. In Jebel-Nuba, a district of the Eastern\r\nSudan, it is forbidden to touch the nests or remove the young of a\r\nspecies of black birds, resembling our blackbirds, because the\r\npeople believe that the parent birds would avenge the wrong by\r\ncausing a stormy wind to blow, which would destroy the harvest.\r\n\r\nBut the savage clearly cannot afford to spare all animals. He must\r\neither eat some of them or starve, and when the question thus comes\r\nto be whether he or the animal must perish, he is forced to overcome\r\nhis superstitious scruples and take the life of the beast. At the\r\nsame time he does all he can to appease his victims and their\r\nkinsfolk. Even in the act of killing them he testifies his respect\r\nfor them, endeavours to excuse or even conceal his share in\r\nprocuring their death, and promises that their remains will be\r\nhonourably treated. By thus robbing death of its terrors, he hopes\r\nto reconcile his victims to their fate and to induce their fellows\r\nto come and be killed also. For example, it was a principle with the\r\nKamtchatkans never to kill a land or sea animal without first making\r\nexcuses to it and begging that the animal would not take it ill.\r\nAlso they offered it cedarnuts and so forth, to make it think that\r\nit was not a victim but a guest at a feast. They believed that this\r\nhindered other animals of the same species from growing shy. For\r\ninstance, after they had killed a bear and feasted on its flesh, the\r\nhost would bring the bear\'s head before the company, wrap it in\r\ngrass, and present it with a variety of trifles. Then he would lay\r\nthe blame of the bear\'s death on the Russians, and bid the beast\r\nwreak his wrath upon them. Also he would ask the bear to inform the\r\nother bears how well he had been treated, that they too might come\r\nwithout fear. Seals, sea-lions, and other animals were treated by\r\nthe Kamtchatkans with the same ceremonious respect. Moreover, they\r\nused to insert sprigs of a plant resembling bear\'s wort in the\r\nmouths of the animals they killed; after which they would exhort the\r\ngrinning skulls to have no fear but to go and tell it to their\r\nfellows, that they also might come and be caught and so partake of\r\nthis splendid hospitality. When the Ostiaks have hunted and killed a\r\nbear, they cut off its head and hang it on a tree. Then they gather\r\nround in a circle and pay it divine honours. Next they run towards\r\nthe carcase uttering lamentations and saying, "Who killed you? It\r\nwas the Russians. Who cut off your head? It was a Russian axe. Who\r\nskinned you? It was a knife made by a Russian." They explain, too,\r\nthat the feathers which sped the arrow on its flight came from the\r\nwing of a strange bird, and that they did nothing but let the arrow\r\ngo. They do all this because they believe that the wandering ghost\r\nof the slain bear would attack them on the first opportunity, if\r\nthey did not thus appease it. Or they stuff the skin of the slain\r\nbear with hay; and after celebrating their victory with songs of\r\nmockery and insult, after spitting on and kicking it, they set it up\r\non its hind legs, "and then, for a considerable time, they bestow on\r\nit all the veneration due to a guardian god." When a party of Koryak\r\nhave killed a bear or a wolf, they skin the beast and dress one of\r\nthemselves in the skin. Then they dance round the skin-clad man,\r\nsaying that it was not they who killed the animal, but some one\r\nelse, generally a Russian. When they kill a fox they skin it, wrap\r\nthe body in grass, and bid him go tell his companions how hospitably\r\nhe has been received, and how he has received a new cloak instead of\r\nhis old one. A fuller account of the Koryak ceremonies is given by a\r\nmore recent writer. He tells us that when a dead bear is brought to\r\nthe house, the women come out to meet it, dancing with firebrands.\r\nThe bear-skin is taken off along with the head; and one of the women\r\nputs on the skin, dances in it, and entreats the bear not to be\r\nangry, but to be kind to the people. At the same time they offer\r\nmeat on a wooden platter to the dead beast, saying, "Eat, friend."\r\nAfterwards a ceremony is performed for the purpose of sending the\r\ndead bear, or rather his spirit, away back to his home. He is\r\nprovided with provisions for the journey in the shape of puddings or\r\nreindeer-flesh packed in a grass bag. His skin is stuffed with grass\r\nand carried round the house, after which he is supposed to depart\r\ntowards the rising sun. The intention of the ceremonies is to\r\nprotect the people from the wrath of the slain bear and his\r\nkinsfolk, and so to ensure success in future bear-hunts. The Finns\r\nused to try to persuade a slain bear that he had not been killed by\r\nthem, but had fallen from a tree, or met his death in some other\r\nway; moreover, they held a funeral festival in his honour, at the\r\nclose of which bards expatiated on the homage that had been paid to\r\nhim, urging him to report to the other bears the high consideration\r\nwith which he had been treated, in order that they also, following\r\nhis example, might come and be slain. When the Lapps had succeeded\r\nin killing a bear with impunity, they thanked him for not hurting\r\nthem and for not breaking the clubs and spears which had given him\r\nhis death wounds; and they prayed that he would not visit his death\r\nupon them by sending storms or in any other way. His flesh then\r\nfurnished a feast.\r\n\r\nThe reverence of hunters for the bear whom they regularly kill and\r\neat may thus be traced all along the northern region of the Old\r\nWorld from Bering\'s Straits to Lappland. It reappears in similar\r\nforms in North America. With the American Indians a bear hunt was an\r\nimportant event for which they prepared by long fasts and\r\npurgations. Before setting out they offered expiatory sacrifices to\r\nthe souls of bears slain in previous hunts, and besought them to be\r\nfavourable to the hunters. When a bear was killed the hunter lit his\r\npipe, and putting the mouth of it between the bear\'s lips, blew into\r\nthe bowl, filling the beast\'s mouth with smoke. Then he begged the\r\nbear not to be angry at having been killed, and not to thwart him\r\nafterwards in the chase. The carcase was roasted whole and eaten;\r\nnot a morsel of the flesh might be left over. The head, painted red\r\nand blue, was hung on a post and addressed by orators, who heaped\r\npraise on the dead beast. When men of the Bear clan in the Ottawa\r\ntribe killed a bear, they made him a feast of his own flesh, and\r\naddressed him thus: "Cherish us no grudge because we have killed\r\nyou. You have sense; you see that our children are hungry. They love\r\nyou and wish to take you into their bodies. Is it not glorious to be\r\neaten by the children of a chief?" Amongst the Nootka Indians of\r\nBritish Columbia, when a bear had been killed, it was brought in and\r\nseated before the head chief in an upright posture, with a chief\'s\r\nbonnet, wrought in figures, on its head, and its fur powdered over\r\nwith white down. A tray of provisions was then set before it, and it\r\nwas invited by words and gestures to eat. After that the animal was\r\nskinned, boiled, and eaten.\r\n\r\nA like respect is testified for other dangerous creatures by the\r\nhunters who regularly trap and kill them. When Caffre hunters are in\r\nthe act of showering spears on an elephant, they call out, "Don\'t\r\nkill us, great captain; don\'t strike or tread upon us, mighty\r\nchief." When he is dead they make their excuses to him, pretending\r\nthat his death was a pure accident. As a mark of respect they bury\r\nhis trunk with much solemn ceremony; for they say that "the elephant\r\nis a great lord; his trunk is his hand." Before the Amaxosa Caffres\r\nattack an elephant they shout to the animal and beg him to pardon\r\nthem for the slaughter they are about to perpetrate, professing\r\ngreat submission to his person and explaining clearly the need they\r\nhave of his tusks to enable them to procure beads and supply their\r\nwants. When they have killed him they bury in the ground, along with\r\nthe end of his trunk, a few of the articles they have obtained for\r\nthe ivory, thus hoping to avert some mishap that would otherwise\r\nbefall them. Amongst some tribes of Eastern Africa, when a lion is\r\nkilled, the carcase is brought before the king, who does homage to\r\nit by prostrating himself on the ground and rubbing his face on the\r\nmuzzle of the beast. In some parts of Western Africa if a negro\r\nkills a leopard he is bound fast and brought before the chiefs for\r\nhaving killed one of their peers. The man defends himself on the\r\nplea that the leopard is chief of the forest and therefore a\r\nstranger. He is then set at liberty and rewarded. But the dead\r\nleopard, adorned with a chief\'s bonnet, is set up in the village,\r\nwhere nightly dances are held in its honour. The Baganda greatly\r\nfear the ghosts of buffaloes which they have killed, and they always\r\nappease these dangerous spirits. On no account will they bring the\r\nhead of a slain buffalo into a village or into a garden of\r\nplantains: they always eat the flesh of the head in the open\r\ncountry. Afterwards they place the skull in a small hut built for\r\nthe purpose, where they pour out beer as an offering and pray to the\r\nghost to stay where he is and not to harm them.\r\n\r\nAnother formidable beast whose life the savage hunter takes with\r\njoy, yet with fear and trembling, is the whale. After the slaughter\r\nof a whale the maritime Koryak of North-eastern Siberia hold a\r\ncommunal festival, the essential part of which "is based on the\r\nconception that the whale killed has come on a visit to the village;\r\nthat it is staying for some time, during which it is treated with\r\ngreat respect; that it then returns to the sea to repeat its visit\r\nthe following year; that it will induce its relatives to come along,\r\ntelling them of the hospitable reception that has been accorded to\r\nit. According to the Koryak ideas, the whales, like all other\r\nanimals, constitute one tribe, or rather family, of related\r\nindividuals, who live in villages like the Koryak. They avenge the\r\nmurder of one of their number, and are grateful for kindnesses that\r\nthey may have received." When the inhabitants of the Isle of St.\r\nMary, to the north of Madagascar, go a-whaling, they single out the\r\nyoung whales for attack and "humbly beg the mother\'s pardon, stating\r\nthe necessity that drives them to kill her progeny, and requesting\r\nthat she will be pleased to go below while the deed is doing, that\r\nher maternal feelings may not be outraged by witnessing what must\r\ncause her so much uneasiness." An Ajumba hunter having killed a\r\nfemale hippopotamus on Lake Azyingo in West Africa, the animal was\r\ndecapitated and its quarters and bowels removed. Then the hunter,\r\nnaked, stepped into the hollow of the ribs, and kneeling down in the\r\nbloody pool washed his whole body with the blood and excretions of\r\nthe animal, while he prayed to the soul of the hippopotamus not to\r\nbear him a grudge for having killed her and so blighted her hopes of\r\nfuture maternity; and he further entreated the ghost not to stir up\r\nother hippopotamuses to avenge her death by butting at and capsizing\r\nhis canoe.\r\n\r\nThe ounce, a leopard-like creature, is dreaded for its depredations\r\nby the Indians of Brazil. When they have caught one of these animals\r\nin a snare, they kill it and carry the body home to the village.\r\nThere the women deck the carcase with feathers of many colours, put\r\nbracelets on its legs, and weep over it, saying, "I pray thee not to\r\ntake vengeance on our little ones for having been caught and killed\r\nthrough thine own ignorance. For it was not we who deceived thee, it\r\nwas thyself. Our husbands only set the trap to catch animals that\r\nare good to eat; they never thought to take thee in it. Therefore,\r\nlet not thy soul counsel thy fellows to avenge thy death on our\r\nlittle ones!" When a Blackfoot Indian has caught eagles in a trap\r\nand killed them, he takes them home to a special lodge, called the\r\neagles\' lodge, which has been prepared for their reception outside\r\nof the camp. Here he sets the birds in a row on the ground, and\r\npropping up their heads on a stick, puts a piece of dried meat in\r\neach of their mouths in order that the spirits of the dead eagles\r\nmay go and tell the other eagles how well they are being treated by\r\nthe Indians. So when Indian hunters of the Orinoco region have\r\nkilled an animal, they open its mouth and pour into it a few drops\r\nof the liquor they generally carry with them, in order that the soul\r\nof the dead beast may inform its fellows of the welcome it has met\r\nwith, and that they too, cheered by the prospect of the same kind\r\nreception, may come with alacrity to be killed. When a Teton Indian\r\nis on a journey, and he meets a grey spider or a spider with yellow\r\nlegs, he kills it, because some evil would befall him if he did not.\r\nBut he is very careful not to let the spider know that he kills it,\r\nfor if the spider knew, his soul would go and tell the other\r\nspiders, and one of them would be sure to avenge the death of his\r\nrelation. So in crushing the insect, the Indian says, "O Grandfather\r\nSpider, the Thunder-beings kill you." And the spider is crushed at\r\nonce and believes what is told him. His soul probably runs and tells\r\nthe other spiders that the Thunder-beings have killed him; but no\r\nharm comes of that. For what can grey or yellow-legged spiders do to\r\nthe Thunder-beings?\r\n\r\nBut it is not merely dangerous creatures with whom the savage\r\ndesires to keep on good terms. It is true that the respect which he\r\npays to wild beasts is in some measure proportioned to their\r\nstrength and ferocity. Thus the savage Stiens of Cambodia, believing\r\nthat all animals have souls which roam about after their death, beg\r\nan animal\'s pardon when they kill it, lest its soul should come and\r\ntorment them. Also they offer it sacrifices, but these sacrifices\r\nare proportioned to the size and strength of the animal. The\r\nceremonies which they observe at the death of an elephant are\r\nconducted with much pomp and last seven days. Similar distinctions\r\nare drawn by North American Indians. "The bear, the buffalo, and the\r\nbeaver are manidos [divinities] which furnish food. The bear is\r\nformidable, and good to eat. They render ceremonies to him, begging\r\nhim to allow himself to be eaten, although they know he has no fancy\r\nfor it. We kill you, but you are not annihilated. His head and paws\r\nare objects of homage. . . . Other animals are treated similarly\r\nfrom similar reasons. . . . Many of the animal manidos, not being\r\ndangerous, are often treated with contempt--the terrapin, the\r\nweasel, polecat, etc." The distinction is instructive. Animals which\r\nare feared, or are good to eat, or both, are treated with\r\nceremonious respect; those which are neither formidable nor good to\r\neat are despised. We have had examples of reverence paid to animals\r\nwhich are both feared and eaten. It remains to prove that similar\r\nrespect is shown to animals which, without being feared, are either\r\neaten or valued for their skins.\r\n\r\nWhen Siberian sable-hunters have caught a sable, no one is allowed\r\nto see it, and they think that if good or evil be spoken of the\r\ncaptured sable no more sables will be caught. A hunter has been\r\nknown to express his belief that the sables could hear what was said\r\nof them as far off as Moscow. He said that the chief reason why the\r\nsable hunt was now so unproductive was that some live sables had\r\nbeen sent to Moscow. There they had been viewed with astonishment as\r\nstrange animals, and the sables cannot abide that. Another, though\r\nminor, cause of the diminished take of sables was, he alleged, that\r\nthe world is now much worse than it used to be, so that nowadays a\r\nhunter will sometimes hide the sable which he has got instead of\r\nputting it into the common stock. This also, said he, the sables\r\ncannot abide. Alaskan hunters preserve the bones of sables and\r\nbeavers out of reach of the dogs for a year and then bury them\r\ncarefully, "lest the spirits who look after the beavers and sables\r\nshould consider that they are regarded with contempt, and hence no\r\nmore should be killed or trapped." The Canadian Indians were equally\r\nparticular not to let their dogs gnaw the bones, or at least certain\r\nof the bones, of beavers. They took the greatest pains to collect\r\nand preserve these bones, and, when the beaver had been caught in a\r\nnet, they threw them into the river. To a Jesuit who argued that the\r\nbeavers could not possibly know what became of their bones, the\r\nIndians replied, "You know nothing about catching beavers and yet\r\nyou will be prating about it. Before the beaver is stone dead, his\r\nsoul takes a turn in the hut of the man who is killing him and makes\r\na careful note of what is done with his bones. If the bones are\r\ngiven to the dogs, the other beavers would get word of it and would\r\nnot let themselves be caught. Whereas, if their bones are thrown\r\ninto the fire or a river, they are quite satisfied; and it is\r\nparticularly gratifying to the net which caught them." Before\r\nhunting the beaver they offered a solemn prayer to the Great Beaver,\r\nand presented him with tobacco; and when the chase was over, an\r\norator pronounced a funeral oration over the dead beavers. He\r\npraised their spirit and wisdom. "You will hear no more," said he,\r\n"the voice of the chieftains who commanded you and whom you chose\r\nfrom among all the warrior beavers to give you laws. Your language,\r\nwhich the medicine-men understand perfectly, will be heard no more\r\nat the bottom of the lake. You will fight no more battles with the\r\notters, your cruel foes. No, beavers! But your skins shall serve to\r\nbuy arms; we will carry your smoked hams to our children; we will\r\nkeep the dogs from eating your bones, which are so hard."\r\n\r\nThe elan, deer, and elk were treated by the American Indians with\r\nthe same punctilious respect, and for the same reason. Their bones\r\nmight not be given to the dogs nor thrown into the fire, nor might\r\ntheir fat be dropped upon the fire, because the souls of the dead\r\nanimals were believed to see what was done to their bodies and to\r\ntell it to the other beasts, living and dead. Hence, if their bodies\r\nwere illused, the animals of that species would not allow themselves\r\nto be taken, neither in this world nor in the world to come. Among\r\nthe Chiquites of Paraguay a sick man would be asked by the\r\nmedicine-man whether he had not thrown away some of the flesh of the\r\ndeer or turtle, and if he answered yes, the medicine-man would say,\r\n"That is what is killing you. The soul of the deer or turtle has\r\nentered into your body to avenge the wrong you did it." The Canadian\r\nIndians would not eat the embryos of the elk, unless at the close of\r\nthe hunting season; otherwise the mother-elks would be shy and\r\nrefuse to be caught.\r\n\r\nIn the Timor-laut islands of the Indian Archipelago the skulls of\r\nall the turtles which a fisherman has caught are hung up under his\r\nhouse. Before he goes out to catch another, he addresses himself to\r\nthe skull of the last turtle that he killed, and having inserted\r\nbetel between its jaws, he prays the spirit of the dead animal to\r\nentice its kinsfolk in the sea to come and be caught. In the Poso\r\ndistrict of Central Celebes hunters keep the jawbones of deer and\r\nwild pigs which they have killed and hang them up in their houses\r\nnear the fire. Then they say to the jawbones, "Ye cry after your\r\ncomrades, that your grandfathers, or nephews, or children may not go\r\naway." Their notion is that the souls of the dead deer and pigs\r\ntarry near their jawbones and attract the souls of living deer and\r\npigs, which are thus drawn into the toils of the hunter. Thus the\r\nwily savage employs dead animals as decoys to lure living animals to\r\ntheir doom.\r\n\r\nThe Lengua Indians of the Gran Chaco love to hunt the ostrich, but\r\nwhen they have killed one of these birds and are bringing home the\r\ncarcase to the village, they take steps to outwit the resentful\r\nghost of their victim. They think that when the first natural shock\r\nof death is passed, the ghost of the ostrich pulls himself together\r\nand makes after his body. Acting on this sage calculation, the\r\nIndians pluck feathers from the breast of the bird and strew them at\r\nintervals along the track. At every bunch of feathers the ghost\r\nstops to consider, "Is this the whole of my body or only a part of\r\nit?" The doubt gives him pause, and when at last he has made up his\r\nmind fully at all the bunches, and has further wasted valuable time\r\nby the zigzag course which he invariably pursues in going from one\r\nto another, the hunters are safe at home, and the bilked ghost may\r\nstalk in vain round about the village, which he is too timid to\r\nenter.\r\n\r\nThe Esquimaux about Bering Strait believe that the souls of dead\r\nsea-beasts, such as seals, walrus, and whales, remain attached to\r\ntheir bladders, and that by returning the bladders to the sea they\r\ncan cause the souls to be reincarnated in fresh bodies and so\r\nmultiply the game which the hunters pursue and kill. Acting on this\r\nbelief every hunter carefully removes and preserves the bladders of\r\nall the sea-beasts that he kills; and at a solemn festival held once\r\na year in winter these bladders, containing the souls of all the\r\nsea-beasts that have been killed throughout the year, are honoured\r\nwith dances and offerings of food in the public assembly-room, after\r\nwhich they are taken out on the ice and thrust through holes into\r\nthe water; for the simple Esquimaux imagine that the souls of the\r\nanimals, in high good humour at the kind treatment they have\r\nexperienced, will thereafter be born again as seals, walrus, and\r\nwhales, and in that form will flock willingly to be again speared,\r\nharpooned, or otherwise done to death by the hunters.\r\n\r\nFor like reasons, a tribe which depends for its subsistence, chiefly\r\nor in part, upon fishing is careful to treat the fish with every\r\nmark of honour and respect. The Indians of Peru "adored the fish\r\nthat they caught in greatest abundance; for they said that the first\r\nfish that was made in the world above (for so they named Heaven)\r\ngave birth to all other fish of that species, and took care to send\r\nthem plenty of its children to sustain their tribe. For this reason\r\nthey worshipped sardines in one region, where they killed more of\r\nthem than of any other fish; in others, the skate; in others, the\r\ndogfish; in others, the golden fish for its beauty; in others, the\r\ncrawfish; in others, for want of larger gods, the crabs, where they\r\nhad no other fish, or where they knew not how to catch and kill\r\nthem. In short, they had whatever fish was most serviceable to them\r\nas their gods." The Kwakiutl Indians of British Columbia think that\r\nwhen a salmon is killed its soul returns to the salmon country.\r\nHence they take care to throw the bones and offal into the sea, in\r\norder that the soul may reanimate them at the resurrection of the\r\nsalmon. Whereas if they burned the bones the soul would be lost, and\r\nso it would be quite impossible for that salmon to rise from the\r\ndead. In like manner the Ottawa Indians of Canada, believing that\r\nthe souls of dead fish passed into other bodies of fish, never\r\nburned fish bones, for fear of displeasing the souls of the fish,\r\nwho would come no more to the nets. The Hurons also refrained from\r\nthrowing fish bones into the fire, lest the souls of the fish should\r\ngo and warn the other fish not to let themselves be caught, since\r\nthe Hurons would burn their bones. Moreover, they had men who\r\npreached to the fish and persuaded them to come and be caught. A\r\ngood preacher was much sought after, for they thought that the\r\nexhortations of a clever man had a great effect in drawing the fish\r\nto the nets. In the Huron fishing village where the French\r\nmissionary Sagard stayed, the preacher to the fish prided himself\r\nvery much on his eloquence, which was of a florid order. Every\r\nevening after supper, having seen that all the people were in their\r\nplaces and that a strict silence was observed, he preached to the\r\nfish. His text was that the Hurons did not burn fish bones. "Then\r\nenlarging on this theme with extraordinary unction, he exhorted and\r\nconjured and invited and implored the fish to come and be caught and\r\nto be of good courage and to fear nothing, for it was all to serve\r\ntheir friends who honoured them and did not burn their bones." The\r\nnatives of the Duke of York Island annually decorate a canoe with\r\nflowers and ferns, lade it, or are supposed to lade it, with\r\nshell-money, and set it adrift to compensate the fish for their\r\nfellows who have been caught and eaten. It is especially necessary\r\nto treat the first fish caught with consideration in order to\r\nconciliate the rest of the fish, whose conduct may be supposed to be\r\ninfluenced by the reception given to those of their kind which were\r\nthe first to be taken. Accordingly the Maoris always put back into\r\nthe sea the first fish caught, "with a prayer that it may tempt\r\nother fish to come and be caught."\r\n\r\nStill more stringent are the precautions taken when the fish are the\r\nfirst of the season. On salmon rivers, when the fish begin to run up\r\nthe stream in spring, they are received with much deference by\r\ntribes who, like the Indians of the Pacific Coast of North America,\r\nsubsist largely upon a fish diet. In British Columbia the Indians\r\nused to go out to meet the first fish as they came up the river:\r\n"They paid court to them, and would address them thus: \'You fish,\r\nyou fish; you are all chiefs, you are; you are all chiefs.\'" Amongst\r\nthe Tlingit of Alaska the first halibut of the season is carefully\r\nhandled and addressed as a chief, and a festival is given in his\r\nhonour, after which the fishing goes on. In spring, when the winds\r\nblow soft from the south and the salmon begin to run up the Klamath\r\nriver, the Karoks of California dance for salmon, to ensure a good\r\ncatch. One of the Indians, called the Kareya or God-man, retires to\r\nthe mountains and fasts for ten days. On his return the people flee,\r\nwhile he goes to the river, takes the first salmon of the catch,\r\neats some of it, and with the rest kindles the sacred fire in the\r\nsweating house. "No Indian may take a salmon before this dance is\r\nheld, nor for ten days after it, even if his family are starving."\r\nThe Karoks also believe that a fisherman will take no salmon if the\r\npoles of which his spearing-booth is made were gathered on the\r\nriver-side, where the salmon might have seen them. The poles must be\r\nbrought from the top of the highest mountain. The fisherman will\r\nalso labour in vain if he uses the same poles a second year in\r\nbooths or weirs, "because the old salmon will have told the young\r\nones about them." There is a favourite fish of the Aino which appears\r\nin their rivers about May and June. They prepare for the fishing by\r\nobserving rules of ceremonial purity, and when they have gone out to\r\nfish, the women at home must keep strict silence or the fish would\r\nhear them and disappear. When the first fish is caught he is brought\r\nhome and passed through a small opening at the end of the hut, but\r\nnot through the door; for if he were passed through the door, "the\r\nother fish would certainly see him and disappear." This may partly\r\nexplain the custom observed by other savages of bringing game in\r\ncertain cases into their huts, not by the door, but by the window,\r\nthe smoke-hole, or by a special opening at the back of the hut.\r\n\r\nWith some savages a special reason for respecting the bones of game,\r\nand generally of the animals which they eat, is a belief that, if\r\nthe bones are preserved, they will in course of time be reclothed\r\nwith flesh, and thus the animal will come to life again. It is,\r\ntherefore, clearly for the interest of the hunter to leave the bones\r\nintact since to destroy them would be to diminish the future supply\r\nof game. Many of the Minnetaree Indians "believe that the bones of\r\nthose bisons which they have slain and divested of flesh rise again\r\nclothed with renewed flesh, and quickened with life, and become fat,\r\nand fit for slaughter the succeeding June." Hence on the western\r\nprairies of America, the skulls of buffaloes may be seen arranged in\r\ncircles and symmetrical piles, awaiting the resurrection. After\r\nfeasting on a dog, the Dacotas carefully collect the bones, scrape,\r\nwash, and bury them, "partly, as it is said, to testify to the\r\ndog-species, that in feasting upon one of their number no disrespect\r\nwas meant to the species itself, and partly also from a belief that\r\nthe bones of the animal will rise and reproduce another." In\r\nsacrificing an animal the Lapps regularly put aside the bones, eyes,\r\nears, heart, lungs, sexual parts (if the animal was a male), and a\r\nmorsel of flesh from each limb. Then, after eating the remainder of\r\nthe flesh, they laid the bones and the rest in anatomical order in a\r\ncoffin and buried them with the usual rites, believing that the god\r\nto whom the animal was sacrificed would reclothe the bones with\r\nflesh and restore the animal to life in Jabme-Aimo, the subterranean\r\nworld of the dead. Sometimes, as after feasting on a bear, they seem\r\nto have contented themselves with thus burying the bones. Thus the\r\nLapps expected the resurrection of the slain animal to take place in\r\nanother world, resembling in this respect the Kamtchatkans, who\r\nbelieved that every creature, down to the smallest fly, would rise\r\nfrom the dead and live underground. On the other hand, the North\r\nAmerican Indians looked for the resurrection of the animals in the\r\npresent world. The habit, observed especially by Mongolian peoples,\r\nof stuffing the skin of a sacrificed animal, or stretching it on a\r\nframework, points rather to a belief in a resurrection of the latter\r\nsort. The objection commonly entertained by primitive peoples to\r\nbreak the bones of the animals which they have eaten or sacrificed\r\nmay be based either on a belief in the resurrection of the animals,\r\nor on a fear of intimidating other creatures of the same species and\r\noffending the ghosts of the slain animals. The reluctance of North\r\nAmerican Indians and Esquimaux to let dogs gnaw the bones of animals\r\nis perhaps only a precaution to prevent the bones from being broken.\r\n\r\nBut after all the resurrection of dead game may have its\r\ninconveniences, and accordingly some hunters take steps to prevent\r\nit by hamstringing the animal so as to prevent it or its ghost from\r\ngetting up and running away. This is the motive alleged for the\r\npractice by Koui hunters in Laos; they think that the spells which\r\nthey utter in the chase may lose their magical virtue, and that the\r\nslaughtered animal may consequently come to life again and escape.\r\nTo prevent that catastrophe they therefore hamstring the beast as\r\nsoon as they have butchered it. When an Esquimau of Alaska has\r\nkilled a fox, he carefully cuts the tendons of all the animal\'s legs\r\nin order to prevent the ghost from reanimating the body and walking\r\nabout. But hamstringing the carcase is not the only measure which\r\nthe prudent savage adopts for the sake of disabling the ghost of his\r\nvictim. In old days, when the Aino went out hunting and killed a fox\r\nfirst, they took care to tie its mouth up tightly in order to\r\nprevent the ghost of the animal from sallying forth and warning its\r\nfellows against the approach of the hunter. The Gilyaks of the Amoor\r\nRiver put out the eyes of the seals they have killed, lest the\r\nghosts of the slain animals should know their slayers and avenge\r\ntheir death by spoiling the seal-hunt.\r\n\r\nBesides the animals which primitive man dreads for their strength\r\nand ferocity, and those which he reveres on account of the benefits\r\nwhich he expects from them, there is another class of creatures\r\nwhich he sometimes deems it necessary to conciliate by worship and\r\nsacrifice. These are the vermin that infest his crops and his\r\ncattle. To rid himself of these deadly foes the farmer has recourse\r\nto many superstitious devices, of which, though some are meant to\r\ndestroy or intimidate the vermin, others aim at propitiating them\r\nand persuading them by fair means to spare the fruits of the earth\r\nand the herds. Thus Esthonian peasants, in the island of Oesel,\r\nstand in great awe of the weevil, an insect which is exceedingly\r\ndestructive to the grain. They give it a fine name, and if a child\r\nis about to kill a weevil they say, "Don\'t do it; the more we hurt\r\nhim, the more he hurts us." If they find a weevil they bury it in\r\nthe earth instead of killing it. Some even put the weevil under a\r\nstone in the field and offer corn to it. They think that thus it is\r\nappeased and does less harm. Amongst the Saxons of Transylvania, in\r\norder to keep sparrows from the corn, the sower begins by throwing\r\nthe first handful of seed backwards over his head, saying, "That is\r\nfor you, sparrows." To guard the corn against the attacks of\r\nleaf-flies he shuts his eyes and scatters three handfuls of oats in\r\ndifferent directions. Having made this offering to the leaf-flies he\r\nfeels sure that they will spare the corn. A Transylvanian way of\r\nsecuring the crops against all birds, beasts, and insects, is this:\r\nafter he has finished sowing, the sower goes once more from end to\r\nend of the field imitating the gesture of sowing, but with an empty\r\nhand. As he does so he says, "I sow this for the animals; I sow it\r\nfor every thing that flies and creeps, that walks and stands, that\r\nsings and springs, in the name of God the Father, etc." The\r\nfollowing is a German way of freeing a garden from caterpillars.\r\nAfter sunset or at midnight the mistress of the house, or another\r\nfemale member of the family, walks all round the garden dragging a\r\nbroom after her. She may not look behind her, and must keep\r\nmurmuring, "Good evening, Mother Caterpillar, you shall come with\r\nyour husband to church." The garden gate is left open till the\r\nfollowing morning.\r\n\r\nSometimes in dealing with vermin the farmer aims at hitting a happy\r\nmean between excessive rigour on the one hand and weak indulgence on\r\nthe other; kind but firm, he tempers severity with mercy. An ancient\r\nGreek treatise on farming advises the husbandman who would rid his\r\nlands of mice to act thus: "Take a sheet of paper and write on it as\r\nfollows: \'I adjure you, ye mice here present, that ye neither injure\r\nme nor suffer another mouse to do so. I give you yonder field\' (here\r\nyou specify the field); \'but if ever I catch you here again, by the\r\nMother of the Gods I will rend you in seven pieces.\' Write this, and\r\nstick the paper on an unhewn stone in the field before sunrise,\r\ntaking care to keep the written side up." In the Ardennes they say\r\nthat to get rid of rats you should repeat the following words:\r\n"_Erat verbum, apud Deum vestrum._ Male rats and female rats, I\r\nconjure you, by the great God, to go out of my house, out of all my\r\nhabitations, and to betake yourselves to such and such a place,\r\nthere to end your days. _Decretis, reversis et desembarassis virgo\r\npotens, clemens, justitiae._" Then write the same words on pieces of\r\npaper, fold them up, and place one of them under the door by which\r\nthe rats are to go forth, and the other on the road which they are\r\nto take. This exorcism should be performed at sunrise. Some years\r\nago an American farmer was reported to have written a civil letter\r\nto the rats, telling them that his crops were short, that he could\r\nnot afford to keep them through the winter, that he had been very\r\nkind to them, and that for their own good he thought they had better\r\nleave him and go to some of his neighbours who had more grain. This\r\ndocument he pinned to a post in his barn for the rats to read.\r\n\r\nSometimes the desired object is supposed to be attained by treating\r\nwith high distinction one or two chosen individuals of the obnoxious\r\nspecies, while the rest are pursued with relentless rigour. In the\r\nEast Indian island of Bali, the mice which ravage the rice-fields\r\nare caught in great numbers, and burned in the same way that corpses\r\nare burned. But two of the captured mice are allowed to live, and\r\nreceive a little packet of white linen. Then the people bow down\r\nbefore them, as before gods, and let them go. When the farms of the\r\nSea Dyaks or Ibans of Sarawak are much pestered by birds and\r\ninsects, they catch a specimen of each kind of vermin (one sparrow,\r\none grasshopper, and so on), put them in a tiny boat of bark\r\nwell-stocked with provisions, and then allow the little vessel with\r\nits obnoxious passengers to float down the river. If that does not\r\ndrive the pests away, the Dyaks resort to what they deem a more\r\neffectual mode of accomplishing the same purpose. They make a clay\r\ncrocodile as large as life and set it up in the fields, where they\r\noffer it food, rice-spirit, and cloth, and sacrifice a fowl and a\r\npig before it. Mollified by these attentions, the ferocious animal\r\nvery soon gobbles up all the creatures that devour the crops. In\r\nAlbania, if the fields or vineyards are ravaged by locusts or\r\nbeetles, some of the women will assemble with dishevelled hair,\r\ncatch a few of the insects, and march with them in a funeral\r\nprocession to a spring or stream, in which they drown the creatures.\r\nThen one of the women sings, "O locusts and beetles who have left us\r\nbereaved," and the dirge is taken up and repeated by all the women\r\nin chorus. Thus by celebrating the obsequies of a few locusts and\r\nbeetles, they hope to bring about the death of them all. When\r\ncaterpillars invaded a vineyard or field in Syria, the virgins were\r\ngathered, and one of the caterpillars was taken and a girl made its\r\nmother. Then they bewailed and buried it. Thereafter they conducted\r\nthe "mother" to the place where the caterpillars were, consoling\r\nher, in order that all the caterpillars might leave the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIV. Types of Animal Sacrament\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Egyptian and the Aino Types of Sacrament\r\n\r\nWE are now perhaps in a position to understand the ambiguous\r\nbehaviour of the Aino and Gilyaks towards the bear. It has been\r\nshown that the sharp line of demarcation which we draw between\r\nmankind and the lower animals does not exist for the savage. To him\r\nmany of the other animals appear as his equals or even his\r\nsuperiors, not merely in brute force but in intelligence; and if\r\nchoice or necessity leads him to take their lives, he feels bound,\r\nout of regard to his own safety, to do it in a way which will be as\r\ninoffensive as possible not merely to the living animal, but to its\r\ndeparted spirit and to all the other animals of the same species,\r\nwhich would resent an affront put upon one of their kind much as a\r\ntribe of savages would revenge an injury or insult offered to a\r\ntribesman. We have seen that among the many devices by which the\r\nsavage seeks to atone for the wrong done by him to his animal\r\nvictims one is to show marked deference to a few chosen individuals\r\nof the species, for such behaviour is apparently regarded as\r\nentitling him to exterminate with impunity all the rest of the\r\nspecies upon which he can lay hands. This principle perhaps explains\r\nthe attitude, at first sight puzzling and contradictory, of the Aino\r\ntowards the bear. The flesh and skin of the bear regularly afford\r\nthem food and clothing; but since the bear is an intelligent and\r\npowerful animal, it is necessary to offer some satisfaction or\r\natonement to the bear species for the loss which it sustains in the\r\ndeath of so many of its members. This satisfaction or atonement is\r\nmade by rearing young bears, treating them, so long as they live,\r\nwith respect, and killing them with extraordinary marks of sorrow\r\nand devotion. So the other bears are appeased, and do not resent the\r\nslaughter of their kind by attacking the slayers or deserting the\r\ncountry, which would deprive the Aino of one of their means of\r\nsubsistence.\r\n\r\nThus the primitive worship of animals conforms to two types, which\r\nare in some respects the converse of each other. On the one hand,\r\nanimals are worshipped, and are therefore neither killed nor eaten.\r\nOn the other hand, animals are worshipped because they are\r\nhabitually killed and eaten. In both types of worship the animal is\r\nrevered on account of some benefit, positive or negative, which the\r\nsavage hopes to receive from it. In the former worship the benefit\r\ncomes either in the positive shape of protection, advice, and help\r\nwhich the animal affords the man, or in the negative shape of\r\nabstinence from injuries which it is in the power of the animal to\r\ninflict. In the latter worship the benefit takes the material form\r\nof the animal\'s flesh and skin. The two types of worship are in some\r\nmeasure antithetical: in the one, the animal is not eaten because it\r\nis revered; in the other, it is revered because it is eaten. But\r\nboth may be practised by the same people, as we see in the case of\r\nthe North American Indians, who, while they apparently revere and\r\nspare their totem animals, also revere the animals and fish upon\r\nwhich they subsist. The aborigines of Australia have totemism in the\r\nmost primitive form known to us; but there is no clear evidence that\r\nthey attempt, like the North American Indians, to conciliate the\r\nanimals which they kill and eat. The means which the Australians\r\nadopt to secure a plentiful supply of game appear to be primarily\r\nbased, not on conciliation, but on sympathetic magic, a principle to\r\nwhich the North American Indians also resort for the same purpose.\r\nHence, as the Australians undoubtedly represent a ruder and earlier\r\nstage of human progress than the American Indians, it would seem\r\nthat before hunters think of worshipping the game as a means of\r\nensuring an abundant supply of it, they seek to attain the same end\r\nby sympathetic magic. This, again, would show--what there is good\r\nreason for believing--that sympathetic magic is one of the earliest\r\nmeans by which man endeavours to adapt the agencies of nature to his\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\nCorresponding to the two distinct types of animal worship, there are\r\ntwo distinct types of the custom of killing the animal god. On the\r\none hand, when the revered animal is habitually spared, it is\r\nnevertheless killed--and sometimes eaten--on rare and solemn\r\noccasions. Examples of this custom have been already given and an\r\nexplanation of them offered. On the other hand, when the revered\r\nanimal is habitually killed, the slaughter of any one of the species\r\ninvolves the killing of the god, and is atoned for on the spot by\r\napologies and sacrifices, especially when the animal is a powerful\r\nand dangerous one; and, in addition to this ordinary and everyday\r\natonement, there is a special annual atonement, at which a select\r\nindividual of the species is slain with extraordinary marks of\r\nrespect and devotion. Clearly the two types of sacramental\r\nkilling--the Egyptian and the Aino types, as we may call them for\r\ndistinction--are liable to be confounded by an observer; and, before\r\nwe can say to which type any particular example belongs, it is\r\nnecessary to ascertain whether the animal sacramentally slain\r\nbelongs to a species which is habitually spared, or to one which is\r\nhabitually killed by the tribe. In the former case the example\r\nbelongs to the Egyptian type of sacrament, in the latter to the Aino\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nThe practice of pastoral tribes appears to furnish examples of both\r\ntypes of sacrament. "Pastoral tribes," says Adolf Bastian, "being\r\nsometimes obliged to sell their herds to strangers who may handle\r\nthe bones disrespectfully, seek to avert the danger which such a\r\nsacrilege would entail by consecrating one of the herd as an object\r\nof worship, eating it sacramentally in the family circle with closed\r\ndoors, and afterwards treating the bones with all the ceremonious\r\nrespect which, strictly speaking, should be accorded to every head\r\nof cattle, but which, being punctually paid to the representative\r\nanimal, is deemed to be paid to all. Such family meals are found\r\namong various peoples, especially those of the Caucasus. When\r\namongst the Abchases the shepherds in spring eat their common meal\r\nwith their loins girt and their staves in their hands, this may be\r\nlooked upon both as a sacrament and as an oath of mutual help and\r\nsupport. For the strongest of all oaths is that which is accompanied\r\nwith the eating of a sacred substance, since the perjured person\r\ncannot possibly escape the avenging god whom he has taken into his\r\nbody and assimilated." This kind of sacrament is of the Aino or\r\nexpiatory type, since it is meant to atone to the species for the\r\npossible ill-usage of individuals. An expiation, similar in\r\nprinciple but different in details, is offered by the Kalmucks to\r\nthe sheep, whose flesh is one of their staple foods. Rich Kalmucks\r\nare in the habit of consecrating a white ram under the title of "the\r\nram of heaven" or "the ram of the spirit." The animal is never shorn\r\nand never sold; but when it grows old and its owner wishes to\r\nconsecrate a new one, the old ram must be killed and eaten at a\r\nfeast to which the neighbours are invited. On a lucky day, generally\r\nin autumn when the sheep are fat, a sorcerer kills the old ram,\r\nafter sprinkling it with milk. Its flesh is eaten; the skeleton,\r\nwith a portion of the fat, is burned on a turf altar; and the skin,\r\nwith the head and feet, is hung up.\r\n\r\nAn example of a sacrament of the Egyptian type is furnished by the\r\nTodas, a pastoral people of Southern India, who subsist largely upon\r\nthe milk of their buffaloes. Amongst them "the buffalo is to a\r\ncertain degree held sacred" and "is treated with great kindness,\r\neven with a degree of adoration, by the people." They never eat the\r\nflesh of the cow buffalo, and as a rule abstain from the flesh of\r\nthe male. But to the latter rule there is a single exception. Once a\r\nyear all the adult males of the village join in the ceremony of\r\nkilling and eating a very young male calf--seemingly under a month\r\nold. They take the animal into the dark recesses of the village\r\nwood, where it is killed with a club made from the sacred tree of\r\nthe Todas (the _Millingtonia_). A sacred fire having been made by\r\nthe rubbing of sticks, the flesh of the calf is roasted on the\r\nembers of certain trees, and is eaten by the men alone, women being\r\nexcluded from the assembly. This is the only occasion on which the\r\nTodas eat buffalo flesh. The Madi or Moru tribe of Central Africa,\r\nwhose chief wealth is their cattle, though they also practise\r\nagriculture, appear to kill a lamb sacramentally on certain solemn\r\noccasions. The custom is thus described by Dr. Felkin: "A remarkable\r\ncustom is observed at stated times--once a year, I am led to\r\nbelieve. I have not been able to ascertain what exact meaning is\r\nattached to it. It appears, however, to relieve the people\'s minds,\r\nfor beforehand they evince much sadness, and seem very joyful when\r\nthe ceremony is duly accomplished. The following is what takes\r\nplace: A large concourse of people of all ages assemble, and sit\r\ndown round a circle of stones, which is erected by the side of a\r\nroad (really a narrow path). A very choice lamb is then fetched by a\r\nboy, who leads it four times round the assembled people. As it\r\npasses they pluck off little bits of its fleece and place them in\r\ntheir hair, or on to some other part of their body. The lamb is then\r\nled up to the stones, and there killed by a man belonging to a kind\r\nof priestly order, who takes some of the blood and sprinkles it four\r\ntimes over the people. He then applies it individually. On the\r\nchildren he makes a small ring of blood over the lower end of the\r\nbreast bone, on women and girls he makes a mark above the breasts,\r\nand the men he touches on each shoulder. He then proceeds to explain\r\nthe ceremony, and to exhort the people to show kindness. . . . When\r\nthis discourse, which is at times of great length, is over, the\r\npeople rise, each places a leaf on or by the circle of stones, and\r\nthen they depart with signs of great joy. The lamb\'s skull is hung\r\non a tree near the stones, and its flesh is eaten by the poor. This\r\nceremony is observed on a small scale at other times. If a family is\r\nin any great trouble, through illness or bereavement, their friends\r\nand neighbours come together and a lamb is killed; this is thought\r\nto avert further evil. The same custom prevails at the grave of\r\ndeparted friends, and also on joyful occasions, such as the return\r\nof a son home after a very prolonged absence." The sorrow thus\r\nmanifested by the people at the annual slaughter of the lamb seems\r\nto show that the lamb slain is a sacred or divine animal, whose\r\ndeath is mourned by his worshippers, just as the death of the sacred\r\nbuzzard was mourned by the Californians and the death of the Theban\r\nram by the Egyptians. The smearing each of the worshippers with the\r\nblood of the lamb is a form of communion with the divinity; the\r\nvehicle of the divine life is applied externally instead of being\r\ntaken internally, as when the blood is drunk or the flesh eaten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Processions with Sacred Animals\r\n\r\nTHE FORM of communion in which the sacred animal is taken from house\r\nto house, that all may enjoy a share of its divine influence, has\r\nbeen exemplified by the Gilyak custom of promenading the bear\r\nthrough the village before it is slain. A similar form of communion\r\nwith the sacred snake is observed by a Snake tribe in the Punjaub.\r\nOnce a year in the month of September the snake is worshipped by all\r\ncastes and religions for nine days only. At the end of August the\r\nMirasans, especially those of the Snake tribe, make a snake of dough\r\nwhich they paint black and red, and place on a winnowing basket.\r\nThis basket they carry round the village, and on entering any house\r\nthey say: "God be with you all! May every ill be far! May our\r\npatron\'s (Gugga\'s) word thrive!" Then they present the basket with\r\nthe snake, saying: "A small cake of flour: a little bit of butter:\r\nif you obey the snake, you and yours shall thrive!" Strictly\r\nspeaking, a cake and butter should be given, but it is seldom done.\r\nEvery one, however, gives something, generally a handful of dough or\r\nsome corn. In houses where there is a new bride or whence a bride\r\nhas gone, or where a son has been born, it is usual to give a rupee\r\nand a quarter, or some cloth. Sometimes the bearers of the snake\r\nalso sing:\r\n\r\n\r\n"Give the snake a piece of cloth, and he will send a lively bride!"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen every house has been thus visited, the dough snake is buried\r\nand a small grave is erected over it. Thither during the nine days\r\nof September the women come to worship. They bring a basin of curds,\r\na small portion of which they offer at the snake\'s grave, kneeling\r\non the ground and touching the earth with their foreheads. Then they\r\ngo home and divide the rest of the curds among the children. Here\r\nthe dough snake is clearly a substitute for a real snake. Indeed, in\r\ndistricts where snakes abound the worship is offered, not at the\r\ngrave of the dough snake, but in the jungles where snakes are known\r\nto be. Besides this yearly worship, performed by all the people, the\r\nmembers of the Snake tribe worship in the same way every morning\r\nafter a new moon. The Snake tribe is not uncommon in the Punjaub.\r\nMembers of it will not kill a snake, and they say that its bite does\r\nnot hurt them. If they find a dead snake, they put clothes on it and\r\ngive it a regular funeral.\r\n\r\nCeremonies closely analogous to this Indian worship of the snake\r\nhave survived in Europe into recent times, and doubtless date from a\r\nvery primitive paganism. The best-known example is the "hunting of\r\nthe wren." By many European peoples--the ancient Greeks and Romans,\r\nthe modern Italians, Spaniards, French, Germans, Dutch, Danes,\r\nSwedes, English, and Welsh--the wren has been designated the king,\r\nthe little king, the king of birds, the hedge king, and so forth,\r\nand has been reckoned amongst those birds which it is extremely\r\nunlucky to kill. In England it is supposed that if any one kills a\r\nwren or harries its nest, he will infallibly break a bone or meet\r\nwith some dreadful misfortune within the year; sometimes it is\r\nthought that the cows will give bloody milk. In Scotland the wren is\r\ncalled "the Lady of Heaven\'s hen," and boys say:\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Malisons, malisons, mair than ten,\r\n     That harry the Ladye of Heaven\'s hen!"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Saint Donan, in Brittany, people believe that if children touch\r\nthe young wrens in the nest, they will suffer from the fire of St.\r\nLawrence, that is, from pimples on the face, legs, and so on. In\r\nother parts of France it is thought that if a person kills a wren or\r\nharries its nest, his house will be struck by lightning, or that the\r\nfingers with which he did the deed will shrivel up and drop off, or\r\nat least be maimed, or that his cattle will suffer in their feet.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding such beliefs, the custom of annually killing the\r\nwren has prevailed widely both in this country and in France. In the\r\nIsle of Man down to the eighteenth century the custom was observed\r\non Christmas Eve, or rather Christmas morning. On the twenty-fourth\r\nof December, towards evening, all the servants got a holiday; they\r\ndid not go to bed all night, but rambled about till the bells rang\r\nin all the churches at midnight. When prayers were over, they went\r\nto hunt the wren, and having found one of these birds they killed it\r\nand fastened it to the top of a long pole with its wings extended.\r\nThus they carried it in procession to every house chanting the\r\nfollowing rhyme:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "We hunted the wren for Robin the Bobbin,\r\n    We hunted the wren for Jack of the Can,\r\n    We hunted the wren for Robin the Bobbin,\r\n    We hunted the wren for every one."\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they had gone from house to house and collected all the money\r\nthey could, they laid the wren on a bier and carried it in\r\nprocession to the parish churchyard, where they made a grave and\r\nburied it "with the utmost solemnity, singing dirges over her in the\r\nManks language, which they call her knell; after which Christmas\r\nbegins." The burial over, the company outside the churchyard formed\r\na circle and danced to music.\r\n\r\nA writer of the eighteenth century says that in Ireland the wren "is\r\nstill hunted and killed by the peasants on Christmas Day, and on the\r\nfollowing (St. Stephen\'s Day) he is carried about, hung by the leg,\r\nin the centre of two hoops, crossing each other at right angles, and\r\na procession made in every village, of men, women, and children,\r\nsinging an Irish catch, importing him to be the king of all birds."\r\nDown to the present time the "hunting of the wren" still takes place\r\nin parts of Leinster and Connaught. On Christmas Day or St.\r\nStephen\'s Day the boys hunt and kill the wren, fasten it in the\r\nmiddle of a mass of holly and ivy on the top of a broomstick, and on\r\nSt. Stephen\'s Day go about with it from house to house, singing:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "The wren, the wren, the king of all birds,\r\n    St. Stephen\'s Day was caught in the furze;\r\n    Although he is little, his family\'s great,\r\n    I pray you, good landlady, give us a treat."\r\n\r\n\r\nMoney or food (bread, butter, eggs, etc.) were given them, upon\r\nwhich they feasted in the evening.\r\n\r\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century similar customs were\r\nstill observed in various parts of the south of France. Thus at\r\nCarcassone, every year on the first Sunday of December the young\r\npeople of the street Saint Jean used to go out of the town armed\r\nwith sticks, with which they beat the bushes, looking for wrens. The\r\nfirst to strike down one of these birds was proclaimed King. Then\r\nthey returned to the town in procession, headed by the King, who\r\ncarried the wren on a pole. On the evening of the last day of the\r\nyear the King and all who had hunted the wren marched through the\r\nstreets of the town to the light of torches, with drums beating and\r\nfifes playing in front of them. At the door of every house they\r\nstopped, and one of them wrote with chalk on the door _vive le roi!_\r\nwith the number of the year which was about to begin. On the morning\r\nof Twelfth Day the King again marched in procession with great pomp,\r\nwearing a crown and a blue mantle and carrying a sceptre. In front\r\nof him was borne the wren fastened to the top of a pole, which was\r\nadorned with a verdant wreath of olive, of oak, and sometimes of\r\nmistletoe grown on an oak. After hearing high mass in the parish\r\nchurch of St. Vincent, surrounded by his officers and guards, the\r\nKing visited the bishop, the mayor, the magistrates, and the chief\r\ninhabitants, collecting money to defray the expenses of the royal\r\nbanquet which took place in the evening and wound up with a dance.\r\n\r\nThe parallelism between this custom of "hunting the wren" and some\r\nof those which we have considered, especially the Gilyak procession\r\nwith the bear, and the Indian one with the snake, seems too close to\r\nallow us to doubt that they all belong to the same circle of ideas.\r\nThe worshipful animal is killed with special solemnity once a year;\r\nand before or immediately after death he is promenaded from door to\r\ndoor, that each of his worshippers may receive a portion of the\r\ndivine virtues that are supposed to emanate from the dead or dying\r\ngod. Religious processions of this sort must have had a great place\r\nin the ritual of European peoples in prehistoric times, if we may\r\njudge from the numerous traces of them which have survived in\r\nfolk-custom. For example, on the last day of the year, or Hogmanay\r\nas it was called, it used to be customary in the Highlands of\r\nScotland for a man to dress himself up in a cow\'s hide and thus\r\nattired to go from house to house, attended by young fellows, each\r\nof them armed with a staff, to which a bit of raw hide was tied.\r\nRound every house the hide-clad man used to run thrice _deiseal,_\r\nthat is, according to the course of the sun, so as to keep the house\r\non his right hand; while the others pursued him, beating the hide\r\nwith their staves and thereby making a loud noise like the beating\r\nof a drum. In this disorderly procession they also struck the walls\r\nof the house. On being admitted, one of the party, standing within\r\nthe threshold, pronounced a blessing on the family in these words:\r\n"May God bless the house and all that belongs to it, cattle, stones,\r\nand timber! In plenty of meat, of bed and body clothes, and health\r\nof men may it ever abound!" Then each of the party singed in the\r\nfire a little bit of the hide which was tied to his staff; and\r\nhaving done so he applied the singed hide to the nose of every\r\nperson and of every domestic animal belonging to the house. This was\r\nimagined to secure them from diseases and other misfortunes,\r\nparticularly from witchcraft, throughout the ensuing year. The whole\r\nceremony was called _calluinn_ because of the great noise made in\r\nbeating the hide. It was observed in the Hebrides, including St.\r\nKilda, down to the second half of the eighteenth century at least,\r\nand it seems to have survived well into the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLV. The Transference of Evil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Transference to Inanimate Objects\r\n\r\nWE have now traced the practice of killing a god among peoples in\r\nthe hunting, pastoral, and agricultural stages of society; and I\r\nhave attempted to explain the motives which led men to adopt so\r\ncurious a custom. One aspect of the custom still remains to be\r\nnoticed. The accumulated misfortunes and sins of the whole people\r\nare sometimes laid upon the dying god, who is supposed to bear them\r\naway for ever, leaving the people innocent and happy. The notion\r\nthat we can transfer our guilt and sufferings to some other being\r\nwho will bear them for us is familiar to the savage mind. It arises\r\nfrom a very obvious confusion between the physical and the mental,\r\nbetween the material and the immaterial. Because it is possible to\r\nshift a load of wood, stones, or what not, from our own back to the\r\nback of another, the savage fancies that it is equally possible to\r\nshift the burden of his pains and sorrows to another, who will\r\nsuffer them in his stead. Upon this idea he acts, and the result is\r\nan endless number of very unamiable devices for palming off upon\r\nsome one else the trouble which a man shrinks from bearing himself.\r\nIn short, the principle of vicarious suffering is commonly\r\nunderstood and practised by races who stand on a low level of social\r\nand intellectual culture. In the following pages I shall illustrate\r\nthe theory and the practice as they are found among savages in all\r\ntheir naked simplicity, undisguised by the refinements of\r\nmetaphysics and the subtleties of theology.\r\n\r\nThe devices to which the cunning and selfish savage resorts for the\r\nsake of easing himself at the expense of his neighbour are manifold;\r\nonly a few typical examples out of a multitude can be cited. At the\r\noutset it is to be observed that the evil of which a man seeks to\r\nrid himself need not be transferred to a person; it may equally well\r\nbe transferred to an animal or a thing, though in the last case the\r\nthing is often only a vehicle to convey the trouble to the first\r\nperson who touches it. In some of the East Indian islands they think\r\nthat epilepsy can be cured by striking the patient on the face with\r\nthe leaves of certain trees and then throwing them away. The disease\r\nis believed to have passed into the leaves, and to have been thrown\r\naway with them. To cure toothache some of the Australian blacks\r\napply a heated spear-thrower to the cheek. The spear-thrower is then\r\ncast away, and the toothache goes with it in the shape of a black\r\nstone called _karriitch._ Stones of this kind are found in old\r\nmounds and sandhills. They are carefully collected and thrown in the\r\ndirection of enemies in order to give them toothache. The Bahima, a\r\npastoral people of Uganda, often suffer from deep-seated abscesses:\r\n"their cure for this is to transfer the disease to some other person\r\nby obtaining herbs from the medicine-man, rubbing them over the\r\nplace where the swelling is, and burying them in the road where\r\npeople continually pass; the first person who steps over these\r\nburied herbs contracts the disease, and the original patient\r\nrecovers."\r\n\r\nSometimes in case of sickness the malady is transferred to an effigy\r\nas a preliminary to passing it on to a human being. Thus among the\r\nBaganda the medicine-man would sometimes make a model of his patient\r\nin clay; then a relative of the sick man would rub the image over\r\nthe sufferer\'s body and either bury it in the road \\??\\ it in the\r\ngrass by the wayside. The first person who stepped over the image or\r\npassed by it would catch the disease. Sometimes the effigy was made\r\nout of a plantain-flower tied up so as to look like a person; it was\r\nused in the same way as the clay figure. But the use of images for\r\nthis maleficent purpose was a capital crime; any person caught in\r\nthe act of burying one of them in the public road would surely have\r\nbeen put to death.\r\n\r\nIn the western district of the island of Timor, when men or women\r\nare making long and tiring journeys, they fan themselves with leafy\r\nbranches, which they afterwards throw away on particular spots where\r\ntheir forefathers did the same before them. The fatigue which they\r\nfelt is thus supposed to have passed into the leaves and to be left\r\nbehind. Others use stones instead of leaves. Similarly in the Babar\r\nArchipelago tired people will strike themselves with stones,\r\nbelieving that they thus transfer to the stones the weariness which\r\nthey felt in their own bodies. They then throw away the stones in\r\nplaces which are specially set apart for the purpose. A like belief\r\nand practice in many distant parts of the world have given rise to\r\nthose cairns or heaps of sticks and leaves which travellers often\r\nobserve beside the path, and to which every passing native adds his\r\ncontribution in the shape of a stone, or stick, or leaf. Thus in the\r\nSolomon and Banks\' Islands the natives are wont to throw sticks,\r\nstones, or leaves upon a heap at a place of steep descent, or where\r\na difficult path begins, saying, "There goes my fatigue." The act is\r\nnot a religious rite, for the thing thrown on the heap is not an\r\noffering to spiritual powers, and the words which accompany the act\r\nare not a prayer. It is nothing but a magical ceremony for getting\r\nrid of fatigue, which the simple savage fancies he can embody in a\r\nstick, leaf, or stone, and so cast it from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Transference to Animals\r\n\r\nANIMALS are often employed as a vehicle for carrying away or\r\ntransferring the evil. When a Moor has a headache he will sometimes\r\ntake a lamb or a goat and beat it till it falls down, believing that\r\nthe headache will thus be transferred to the animal. In Morocco most\r\nwealthy Moors keep a wild boar in their stables, in order that the\r\njinn and evil spirits may be diverted from the horses and enter into\r\nthe boar. Amongst the Caffres of South Africa, when other remedies\r\nhave failed, "natives sometimes adopt the custom of taking a goat\r\ninto the presence of a sick man, and confess the sins of the kraal\r\nover the animal. Sometimes a few drops of blood from the sick man\r\nare allowed to fall on the head of the goat, which is turned out\r\ninto an uninhabited part of the veldt. The sickness is supposed to\r\nbe transferred to the animal, and to become lost in the desert." In\r\nArabia, when the plague is raging, the people will sometimes lead a\r\ncamel through all the quarters of the town in order that the animal\r\nmay take the pestilence on itself. Then they strangle it in a sacred\r\nplace and imagine that they have rid themselves of the camel and of\r\nthe plague at one blow. It is said that when smallpox is raging the\r\nsavages of Formosa will drive the demon of disease into a sow, then\r\ncut off the animal\'s ears and burn them or it, believing that in\r\nthis way they rid themselves of the plague.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Malagasy the vehicle for carrying away evils is called a\r\n_faditra._ "The faditra is anything selected by the sikidy [divining\r\nboard] for the purpose of taking away any hurtful evils or diseases\r\nthat might prove injurious to an individual\'s happiness, peace, or\r\nprosperity. The faditra may be either ashes, cut money, a sheep, a\r\npumpkin, or anything else the sikidy may choose to direct. After the\r\nparticular article is appointed, the priest counts upon it all the\r\nevils that may prove injurious to the person for whom it is made,\r\nand which he then charges the faditra to take away for ever. If the\r\nfaditra be ashes, it is blown, to be carried away by the wind. If it\r\nbe cut money, it is thrown to the bottom of deep water, or where it\r\ncan never be found. If it be a sheep, it is carried away to a\r\ndistance on the shoulders of a man, who runs with all his might,\r\nmumbling as he goes, as if in the greatest rage against the faditra,\r\nfor the evils it is bearing away. If it be a pumpkin, it is carried\r\non the shoulders to a little distance, and there dashed upon the\r\nground with every appearance of fury and indignation." A Malagasy\r\nwas informed by a diviner that he was doomed to a bloody death, but\r\nthat possibly he might avert his fate by performing a certain rite.\r\nCarrying a small vessel full of blood upon his head, he was to mount\r\nupon the back of a bullock; while thus mounted, he was to spill the\r\nblood upon the bullock\'s head, and then send the animal away into\r\nthe wilderness, whence it might never return.\r\n\r\nThe Bataks of Sumatra have a ceremony which they call "making the\r\ncurse to fly away." When a woman is childless, a sacrifice is\r\noffered to the gods of three grasshoppers, representing a head of\r\ncattle, a buffalo, and a horse. Then a swallow is set free, with a\r\nprayer that the curse may fall upon the bird and fly away with it.\r\n"The entrance into a house of an animal which does not generally\r\nseek to share the abode of man is regarded by the Malays as ominous\r\nof misfortune. If a wild bird flies into a house, it must be\r\ncarefully caught and smeared with oil, and must then be released in\r\nthe open air, a formula being recited in which it is bidden to fly\r\naway with all the ill-luck and misfortunes of the occupier." In\r\nantiquity Greek women seem to have done the same with swallows which\r\nthey caught in the house: they poured oil on them and let them fly\r\naway, apparently for the purpose of removing ill-luck from the\r\nhousehold. The Huzuls of the Carpathians imagine that they can\r\ntransfer freckles to the first swallow they see in spring by washing\r\ntheir face in flowing water and saying, "Swallow, swallow, take my\r\nfreckles, and give me rosy cheeks."\r\n\r\nAmong the Badagas of the Neilgherry Hills in Southern India, when a\r\ndeath has taken place, the sins of the deceased are laid upon a\r\nbuffalo calf. For this purpose the people gather round the corpse\r\nand carry it outside of the village. There an elder of the tribe,\r\nstanding at the head of the corpse, recites or chants a long list of\r\nsins such as any Badaga may commit, and the people repeat the last\r\nword of each line after him. The confession of sins is thrice\r\nrepeated. "By a conventional mode of expression, the sum total of\r\nsins a man may do is said to be thirteen hundred. Admitting that the\r\ndeceased has committed them all, the performer cries aloud, \'Stay\r\nnot their flight to God\'s pure feet.\' As he closes, the whole\r\nassembly chants aloud \'Stay not their flight.\' Again the performer\r\nenters into details, and cries, \'He killed the crawling snake. It is\r\na sin.\' In a moment the last word is caught up, and all the people\r\ncry \'It is a sin.\' As they shout, the performer lays his hand upon\r\nthe calf. The sin is transferred to the calf. Thus the whole\r\ncatalogue is gone through in this impressive way. But this is not\r\nenough. As the last shout \'Let all be well\' dies away, the performer\r\ngives place to another, and again confession is made, and all the\r\npeople shout \'It is a sin.\' A third time it is done. Then, still in\r\nsolemn silence, the calf is let loose. Like the Jewish scapegoat, it\r\nmay never be used for secular work." At a Badaga funeral witnessed\r\nby the Rev. A. C. Clayton the buffalo calf was led thrice round the\r\nbier, and the dead man\'s hand was laid on its head. "By this act,\r\nthe calf was supposed to receive all the sins of the deceased. It\r\nwas then driven away to a great distance, that it might contaminate\r\nno one, and it was said that it would never be sold, but looked on\r\nas a dedicated sacred animal." The idea of this ceremony is, that\r\nthe sins of the deceased enter the calf, or that the task of his\r\nabsolution is laid on it. They say that the calf very soon\r\ndisappears, and that it is never heard of."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The Transference to Men\r\n\r\nAGAIN, men sometimes play the part of scapegoat by diverting to\r\nthemselves the evils that threaten others. When a Cingalese is\r\ndangerously ill, and the physicians can do nothing, a devil-dancer\r\nis called in, who by making offerings to the devils, and dancing in\r\nthe masks appropriate to them, conjures these demons of disease, one\r\nafter the other, out of the sick man\'s body and into his own. Having\r\nthus successfully extracted the cause of the malady, the artful\r\ndancer lies down on a bier, and shamming death is carried to an open\r\nplace outside the village. Here, being left to himself, he soon\r\ncomes to life again, and hastens back to claim his reward. In 1590 a\r\nScotch which of the name of Agnes Sampson was convicted of curing a\r\ncertain Robert Kers of a disease "laid upon him by a westland\r\nwarlock when he was at Dumfries, whilk sickness she took upon\r\nherself, and kept the same with great groaning and torment till the\r\nmorn, at whilk time there was a great din heard in the house." The\r\nnoise was made by the witch in her efforts to shift the disease, by\r\nmeans of clothes, from herself to a cat or dog. Unfortunately the\r\nattempt partly miscarried. The disease missed the animal and hit\r\nAlexander Douglas of Dalkeith, who dwined and died of it, while the\r\noriginal patient, Robert Kers, was made whole.\r\n\r\n"In one part of New Zealand an expiation for sin was felt to be\r\nnecessary; a service was performed over an individual, by which all\r\nthe sins of the tribe were supposed to be transferred to him, a fern\r\nstalk was previously tied to his person, with which he jumped into\r\nthe river, and there unbinding, allowed it to float away to the sea,\r\nbearing their sins with it." In great emergencies the sins of the\r\nRajah of Manipur used to be transferred to somebody else, usually to\r\na criminal, who earned his pardon by his vicarious sufferings. To\r\neffect the transference the Rajah and his wife, clad in fine robes,\r\nbathed on a scaffold erected in the bazaar, while the criminal\r\ncrouched beneath it. With the water which dripped from them on him\r\ntheir sins also were washed away and fell on the human scapegoat. To\r\ncomplete the transference the Rajah and his wife made over their\r\nfine robes to their substitute, while they themselves, clad in new\r\nraiment, mixed with the people till evening. In Travancore, when a\r\nRajah is near his end, they seek out a holy Brahman, who consents to\r\ntake upon himself the sins of the dying man in consideration of the\r\nsum of ten thousand rupees. Thus prepared to immolate himself on the\r\naltar of duty, the saint is introduced into the chamber of death,\r\nand closely embraces the dying Rajah, saying to him, "O King, I\r\nundertake to bear all your sins and diseases. May your Highness live\r\nlong and reign happily." Having thus taken to himself the sins of\r\nthe sufferer, he is sent away from the country and never more\r\nallowed to return. At Utch Kurgan in Turkestan Mr. Schuyler saw an\r\nold man who was said to get his living by taking on himself the sins\r\nof the dead, and thenceforth devoting his life to prayer for their\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nIn Uganda, when an army had returned from war, and the gods warned\r\nthe king by their oracles that some evil had attached itself to the\r\nsoldiers, it was customary to pick out a woman slave from the\r\ncaptives, together with a cow, a goat, a fowl, and a dog from the\r\nbooty, and to send them back under a strong guard to the borders of\r\nthe country from which they had come. There their limbs were broken\r\nand they were left to die; for they were too crippled to crawl back\r\nto Uganda. In order to ensure the transference of the evil to these\r\nsubstitutes, bunches of grass were rubbed over the people and cattle\r\nand then tied to the victims. After that the army was pronounced\r\nclean and was allowed to return to the capital. So on his accession\r\na new king of Uganda used to wound a man and send him away as a\r\nscapegoat to Bunyoro to carry away any uncleanliness that might\r\nattach to the king or queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The Transference of Evil in Europe\r\n\r\nTHE EXAMPLES of the transference of evil hitherto adduced have been\r\nmostly drawn from the customs of savage or barbarous peoples. But\r\nsimilar attempts to shift the burden of disease, misfortune, and sin\r\nfrom one\'s self to another person, or to an animal or thing, have\r\nbeen common also among the civilised nations of Europe, both in\r\nancient and modern times. A Roman cure for fever was to pare the\r\npatient\'s nails, and stick the parings with wax on a neighbour\'s\r\ndoor before sunrise; the fever then passed from the sick man to his\r\nneighbour. Similar devices must have been resorted to by the Greeks;\r\nfor in laying down laws for his ideal state, Plato thinks it too\r\nmuch to expect that men should not be alarmed at finding certain wax\r\nfigures adhering to their doors or to the tombstones of their\r\nparents, or lying at cross-roads. In the fourth century of our era\r\nMarcellus of Bordeaux prescribed a cure for warts, which has still a\r\ngreat vogue among the superstitious in various parts of Europe. You\r\nare to touch your warts with as many little stones as you have\r\nwarts; then wrap the stones in an ivy leaf, and throw them away in a\r\nthoroughfare. Whoever picks them up will get the warts, and you will\r\nbe rid of them. People in the Orkney Islands will sometimes wash a\r\nsick man, and then throw the water down at a gateway, in the belief\r\nthat the sickness will leave the patient and be transferred to the\r\nfirst person who passes through the gate. A Bavarian cure for fever\r\nis to write upon a piece of paper, "Fever, stay away, I am not at\r\nhome," and to put the paper in somebody\'s pocket. The latter then\r\ncatches the fever, and the patient is rid of it. A Bohemian\r\nprescription for the same malady is this. Take an empty pot, go with\r\nit to a cross-road, throw it down, and run away. The first person\r\nwho kicks against the pot will catch your fever, and you will be\r\ncured.\r\n\r\nOften in Europe, as among savages, an attempt is made to transfer a\r\npain or malady from a man to an animal. Grave writers of antiquity\r\nrecommended that, if a man be stung by a scorpion, he should sit\r\nupon an ass with his face to the tail, or whisper in the animal\'s\r\near, "A scorpion has stung me"; in either case, they thought, the\r\npain would be transferred from the man to the ass. Many cures of\r\nthis sort are recorded by Marcellus. For example, he tells us that\r\nthe following is a remedy for toothache. Standing booted under the\r\nopen sky on the ground, you catch a frog by the head, spit into its\r\nmouth, ask it to carry away the ache, and then let it go. But the\r\nceremony must be performed on a lucky day and at a lucky hour. In\r\nCheshire the ailment known as aphtha or thrush, which affects the\r\nmouth or throat of infants, is not uncommonly treated in much the\r\nsame manner. A young frog is held for a few moments with its head\r\ninside the mouth of the sufferer, whom it is supposed to relieve by\r\ntaking the malady to itself. "I assure you," said an old woman who\r\nhad often superintended such a cure, "we used to hear the poor frog\r\nwhooping and coughing, mortal bad, for days after; it would have\r\nmade your heart ache to hear the poor creature coughing as it did\r\nabout the garden." A Northamptonshire, Devonshire, and Welsh cure\r\nfor a cough is to put a hair of the patient\'s head between two\r\nslices of buttered bread and give the sandwich to a dog. The animal\r\nwill thereupon catch the cough and the patient will lose it.\r\nSometimes an ailment is transferred to an animal by sharing food\r\nwith it. Thus in Oldenburg, if you are sick of a fever you set a\r\nbowl of sweet milk before a dog and say, "Good luck, you hound! may\r\nyou be sick and I be sound!" Then when the dog has lapped some of\r\nthe milk, you take a swig at the bowl; and then the dog must lap\r\nagain, and then you must swig again; and when you and the dog have\r\ndone it the third time, he will have the fever and you will be quit\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nA Bohemian cure for fever is to go out into the forest before the\r\nsun is up and look for a snipe\'s nest. When you have found it, take\r\nout one of the young birds and keep it beside you for three days.\r\nThen go back into the wood and set the snipe free. The fever will\r\nleave you at once. The snipe has taken it away. So in Vedic times\r\nthe Hindoos of old sent consumption away with a blue jay. They said,\r\n"O consumption, fly away, fly away with the blue jay! With the wild\r\nrush of the storm and the whirlwind, oh, vanish away!" In the\r\nvillage of Llandegla in Wales there is a church dedicated to the\r\nvirgin martyr St. Tecla, where the falling sickness is, or used to\r\nbe, cured by being transferred to a fowl. The patient first washed\r\nhis limbs in a sacred well hard by, dropped fourpence into it as an\r\noffering, walked thrice round the well, and thrice repeated the\r\nLord\'s prayer. Then the fowl, which was a cock or a hen according as\r\nthe patient was a man or a woman, was put into a basket and carried\r\nround first the well and afterwards the church. Next the sufferer\r\nentered the church and lay down under the communion table till break\r\nof day. After that he offered sixpence and departed, leaving the\r\nfowl in the church. If the bird died, the sickness was supposed to\r\nhave been transferred to it from the man or woman, who was now rid\r\nof the disorder. As late as 1855 the old parish clerk of the village\r\nremembered quite well to have seen the birds staggering about from\r\nthe effects of the fits which had been transferred to them.\r\n\r\nOften the sufferer seeks to shift his burden of sickness or ill-luck\r\nto some inanimate object. In Athens there is a little chapel of St.\r\nJohn the Baptist built against an ancient column. Fever patients\r\nresort thither, and by attaching a waxed thread to the inner side of\r\nthe column believe that they transfer the fever from themselves to\r\nthe pillar. In the Mark of Brandenburg they say that if you suffer\r\nfrom giddiness you should strip yourself naked and run thrice round\r\na flax-field after sunset; in that way the flax will get the\r\ngiddiness and you will be rid of it.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the thing most commonly employed in Europe as a\r\nreceptacle for sickness and trouble of all sorts is a tree or bush.\r\nA Bulgarian cure for fever is to run thrice around a willow-tree at\r\nsunrise, crying, "The fever shall shake thee, and the sun shall warm\r\nme." In the Greek island of Karpathos the priest ties a red thread\r\nround the neck of a sick person. Next morning the friends of the\r\npatient remove the thread and go out to the hillside, where they tie\r\nthe thread to a tree, thinking that they thus transfer the sickness\r\nto the tree. Italians attempt to cure fever in like manner by\r\ntethering it to a tree The sufferer ties a thread round his left\r\nwrist at night, and hangs the thread on a tree next morning. The\r\nfever is thus believed to be tied up to the tree, and the patient to\r\nbe rid of it; but he must be careful not to pass by that tree again,\r\notherwise the fever would break loose from its bonds and attack him\r\nafresh. A Flemish cure for the ague is to go early in the morning to\r\nan old willow, tie three knots in one of its branches, say,\r\n"Good-morrow, Old One, I give thee the cold; good-morrow, Old One,"\r\nthen turn and run away without looking round. In Sonnenberg, if you\r\nwould rid yourself of gout you should go to a young fir-tree and tie\r\na knot in one of its twigs, saying, "God greet thee, noble fir. I\r\nbring thee my gout. Here will I tie a knot and bind my gout into it.\r\nIn the name," etc.\r\n\r\nAnother way of transferring gout from a man to a tree is this. Pare\r\nthe nails of the sufferer\'s fingers and clip some hairs from his\r\nlegs. Bore a hole in an oak, stuff the nails and hair in the hole,\r\nstop up the hole again, and smear it with cow\'s dung. If, for three\r\nmonths thereafter, the patient is free of gout, you may be sure the\r\noak has it in his stead. In Cheshire if you would be rid of warts,\r\nyou have only to rub them with a piece of bacon, cut a slit in the\r\nbark of an ash-tree, and slip the bacon under the bark. Soon the\r\nwarts will disappear from your hand, only however to reappear in the\r\nshape of rough excrescences or knobs on the bark of the tree. At\r\nBerkhampstead, in Hertfordshire, there used to be certain oak-trees\r\nwhich were long celebrated for the cure of ague. The transference of\r\nthe malady to the tree was simple but painful. A lock of the\r\nsufferer\'s hair was pegged into an oak; then by a sudden wrench he\r\nleft his hair and his ague behind him in the tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVI. The Public Expulsion of Evils\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Omnipresence of Demons\r\n\r\nIN THE FOREGOING chapter the primitive principle of the transference\r\nof ills to another person, animal, or thing was explained and\r\nillustrated. But similar means have been adopted to free a whole\r\ncommunity from diverse evils that afflict it. Such attempts to\r\ndismiss at once the accumulated sorrows of a people are by no means\r\nrare or exceptional; on the contrary they have been made in many\r\nlands, and from being occasional they tend to become periodic and\r\nannual.\r\n\r\nIt needs some effort on our part to realise the frame of mind which\r\nprompts these attempts. Bred in a philosophy which strips nature of\r\npersonality and reduces it to the unknown cause of an orderly series\r\nof impressions on our senses, we find it hard to put ourselves in\r\nthe place of the savage, to whom the same impressions appear in the\r\nguise of spirits or the handiwork of spirits. For ages the army of\r\nspirits, once so near, has been receding farther and farther from\r\nus, banished by the magic wand of science from hearth and home, from\r\nruined cell and ivied tower, from haunted glade and lonely mere,\r\nfrom the riven murky cloud that belches forth the lightning, and\r\nfrom those fairer clouds that pillow the silvery moon or fret with\r\nflakes of burning red the golden eve. The spirits are gone even from\r\ntheir last stronghold in the sky, whose blue arch no longer passes,\r\nexcept with children, for the screen that hides from mortal eyes the\r\nglories of the celestial world. Only in poets\' dreams or impassioned\r\nflights of oratory is it given to catch a glimpse of the last\r\nflutter of the standards of the retreating host, to hear the beat of\r\ntheir invisible wings, the sound of their mocking laughter, or the\r\nswell of angel music dying away in the distance. Far otherwise is it\r\nwith the savage. To his imagination the world still teems with those\r\nmotley beings whom a more sober philosophy has discarded. Fairies\r\nand goblins, ghosts and demons, still hover about him both waking\r\nand sleeping. They dog his footsteps, dazzle his senses, enter into\r\nhim, harass and deceive and torment him in a thousand freakish and\r\nmischievous ways. The mishaps that befall him, the losses he\r\nsustains, the pains he has to endure, he commonly sets down, if not\r\nto the magic of his enemies, to the spite or anger or caprice of the\r\nspirits. Their constant presence wearies him, their sleepless\r\nmalignity exasperates him; he longs with an unspeakable longing to\r\nbe rid of them altogether, and from time to time, driven to bay, his\r\npatience utterly exhausted, he turns fiercely on his persecutors and\r\nmakes a desperate effort to chase the whole pack of them from the\r\nland, to clear the air of their swarming multitudes, that he may\r\nbreathe more freely and go on his way unmolested, at least for a\r\ntime. Thus it comes about that the endeavour of primitive people to\r\nmake a clean sweep of all their troubles generally takes the form of\r\na grand hunting out and expulsion of devils or ghosts. They think\r\nthat if they can only shake off these their accursed tormentors,\r\nthey will make a fresh start in life, happy and innocent; the tales\r\nof Eden and the old poetic golden age will come true again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Occasional Expulsion of Evils\r\n\r\nWE can therefore understand why those general clearances of evil, to\r\nwhich from time to time the savage resorts, should commonly take the\r\nform of a forcible expulsion of devils. In these evil spirits\r\nprimitive man sees the cause of many if not of most of his troubles,\r\nand he fancies that if he can only deliver himself from them, things\r\nwill go better with him. The public attempts to expel the\r\naccumulated ills of a whole community may be divided into two\r\nclasses, according as the expelled evils are immaterial and\r\ninvisible or are embodied in a material vehicle or scape-goat. The\r\nformer may be called the direct or immediate expulsion of evils; the\r\nlatter the indirect or mediate expulsion, or the expulsion by\r\nscapegoat. We begin with examples of the former.\r\n\r\nIn the island of Rook, between New Guinea and New Britain, when any\r\nmisfortune has happened, all the people run together, scream, curse,\r\nhowl, and beat the air with sticks to drive away the devil, who is\r\nsupposed to be the author of the mishap. From the spot where the\r\nmishap took place they drive him step by step to the sea, and on\r\nreaching the shore they redouble their shouts and blows in order to\r\nexpel him from the island. He generally retires to the sea or to the\r\nisland of Lottin. The natives of New Britain ascribe sickness,\r\ndrought, the failure of crops, and in short all misfortunes, to the\r\ninfluence of wicked spirits. So at times when many people sicken and\r\ndie, as at the beginning of the rainy season, all the inhabitants of\r\na district, armed with branches and clubs, go out by moonlight to\r\nthe fields, where they beat and stamp on the ground with wild howls\r\ntill morning, believing that this drives away the devils; and for\r\nthe same purpose they rush through the village with burning torches.\r\nThe natives of New Caledonia are said to believe that all evils are\r\ncaused by a powerful and malignant spirit; hence in order to rid\r\nthemselves of him they will from time to time dig a great pit, round\r\nwhich the whole tribe gathers. After cursing the demon, they fill up\r\nthe pit with earth, and trample on the top with loud shouts. This\r\nthey call burying the evil spirit. Among the Dieri tribe of Central\r\nAustralia, when a serious illness occurs, the medicine-men expel\r\nCootchie or the devil by beating the ground in and outside of the\r\ncamp with the stuffed tail of a kangaroo, until they have chased the\r\ndemon away to some distance from the camp.\r\n\r\nWhen a village has been visited by a series of disasters or a severe\r\nepidemic, the inhabitants of Minahassa in Celebes lay the blame upon\r\nthe devils who are infesting the village and who must be expelled\r\nfrom it. Accordingly, early one morning all the people, men, women,\r\nand children, quit their homes, carrying their household goods with\r\nthem, and take up their quarters in temporary huts which have been\r\nerected outside the village. Here they spend several days, offering\r\nsacrifices and preparing for the final ceremony. At last the men,\r\nsome wearing masks, others with their faces blackened, and so on,\r\nbut all armed with swords, guns, pikes, or brooms, steal cautiously\r\nand silently back to the deserted village. Then, at a signal from\r\nthe priest, they rush furiously up and down the streets and into and\r\nunder the houses (which are raised on piles above the ground),\r\nyelling and striking on walls, doors, and windows, to drive away the\r\ndevils. Next, the priests and the rest of the people come with the\r\nholy fire and march nine times round each house and thrice round the\r\nladder that leads up to it, carrying the fire with them. Then they\r\ntake the fire into the kitchen, where it must burn for three days\r\ncontinuously. The devils are now driven away, and great and general\r\nis the joy.\r\n\r\nThe Alfoors of Halmahera attribute epidemics to the devil who comes\r\nfrom other villages to carry them off. So, in order to rid the\r\nvillage of the disease, the sorcerer drives away the devil. From all\r\nthe villagers he receives a costly garment and places it on four\r\nvessels, which he takes to the forest and leaves at the spot where\r\nthe devil is supposed to be. Then with mocking words he bids the\r\ndemon abandon the place. In the Kei Islands to the south-west of New\r\nGuinea, the evil spirits, who are quite distinct from the souls of\r\nthe dead, form a mighty host. Almost every tree and every cave is\r\nthe lodging-place of one of these fiends, who are moreover extremely\r\nirascible and apt to fly out on the smallest provocation. They\r\nmanifest their displeasure by sending sickness and other calamities.\r\nHence in times of public misfortune, as when an epidemic is raging,\r\nand all other remedies have failed, the whole population go forth\r\nwith the priest at their head to a place at some distance from the\r\nvillage. Here at sunset they erect a couple of poles with a\r\ncross-bar between them, to which they attach bags of rice, wooden\r\nmodels of pivot-guns, gongs, bracelets, and so on. Then, when\r\neverybody has taken his place at the poles and a death-like silence\r\nreigns, the priest lifts up his voice and addresses the spirits in\r\ntheir own language as follows: "Ho! ho! ho! ye evil spirits who\r\ndwell in the trees, ye evil spirits who live in the grottoes, ye\r\nevil spirits who lodge in the earth, we give you these pivot-guns,\r\nthese gongs, etc. Let the sickness cease and not so many people die\r\nof it." Then everybody runs home as fast as their legs can carry\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn the island of Nias, when a man is seriously ill and other\r\nremedies have been tried in vain, the sorcerer proceeds to exorcise\r\nthe devil who is causing the illness. A pole is set up in front of\r\nthe house, and from the top of the pole a rope of palm-leaves is\r\nstretched to the roof of the house. Then the sorcerer mounts the\r\nroof with a pig, which he kills and allows to roll from the roof to\r\nthe ground. The devil, anxious to get the pig, lets himself down\r\nhastily from the roof by the rope of palm-leaves, and a good spirit,\r\ninvoked by the sorcerer, prevents him from climbing up again. If\r\nthis remedy fails, it is believed that other devils must still be\r\nlurking in the house. So a general hunt is made after them. All the\r\ndoors and windows in the house are closed, except a single\r\ndormer-window in the roof. The men, shut up in the house, hew and\r\nslash with their swords right and left to the clash of gongs and the\r\nrub-a-dub of drums. Terrified at this onslaught, the devils escape\r\nby the dormer-window, and sliding down the rope of palm-leaves take\r\nthemselves off. As all the doors and windows, except the one in the\r\nroof, are shut, the devils cannot get into the house again. In the\r\ncase of an epidemic, the proceedings are similar. All the gates of\r\nthe village, except one, are closed; every voice is raised, every\r\ngong and drum beaten, every sword brandished. Thus the devils are\r\ndriven out and the last gate is shut behind them. For eight days\r\nthereafter the village is in a state of siege, no one being allowed\r\nto enter it.\r\n\r\nWhen cholera has broken out in a Burmese village the able-bodied men\r\nscramble on the roofs and lay about them with bamboos and billets of\r\nwood, while all the rest of the population, old and young, stand\r\nbelow and thump drums, blow trumpets, yell, scream, beat floors,\r\nwalls, tin pans, everything to make a din. This uproar, repeated on\r\nthree successive nights, is thought to be very effective in driving\r\naway the cholera demons. When smallpox first appeared amongst the\r\nKumis of South-Eastern India, they thought it was a devil come from\r\nAracan. The villages were placed in a state of siege, no one being\r\nallowed to leave or enter them. A monkey was killed by being dashed\r\non the ground, and its body was hung at the village gate. Its blood,\r\nmixed with small river pebbles, was sprinkled on the houses, the\r\nthreshold of every house was swept with the monkey\'s tail, and the\r\nfiend was adjured to depart.\r\n\r\nWhen an epidemic is raging on the Gold Coast of West Africa, the\r\npeople will sometimes turn out, armed with clubs and torches, to\r\ndrive the evil spirits away. At a given signal the whole population\r\nbegin with frightful yells to beat in every corner of the houses,\r\nthen rush like mad into the streets waving torches and striking\r\nfrantically in the empty air. The uproar goes on till somebody\r\nreports that the cowed and daunted demons have made good their\r\nescape by a gate of the town or village; the people stream out after\r\nthem, pursue them for some distance into the forest, and warn them\r\nnever to return. The expulsion of the devils is followed by a\r\ngeneral massacre of all the cocks in the village or town, lest by\r\ntheir unseasonable crowing they should betray to the banished demons\r\nthe direction they must take to return to their old homes. When\r\nsickness was prevalent in a Huron village, and all other remedies\r\nhad been tried in vain, the Indians had recourse to the ceremony\r\ncalled _Lonouyroya,_ "which is the principal invention and most\r\nproper means, so they say, to expel from the town or village the\r\ndevils and evil spirits which cause, induce, and import all the\r\nmaladies and infirmities which they suffer in body and mind."\r\nAccordingly, one evening the men would begin to rush like madmen\r\nabout the village, breaking and upsetting whatever they came across\r\nin the wigwams. They threw fire and burning brands about the\r\nstreets, and all night long they ran howling and singing without\r\ncessation. Then they all dreamed of something, a knife, dog, skin,\r\nor whatever it might be, and when morning came they went from wigwam\r\nto wigwam asking for presents. These they received silently, till\r\nthe particular thing was given them which they had dreamed about. On\r\nreceiving it they uttered a cry of joy and rushed from the hut, amid\r\nthe congratulations of all present. The health of those who received\r\nwhat they had dreamed of was believed to be assured; whereas those\r\nwho did not get what they had set their hearts upon regarded their\r\nfate as sealed.\r\n\r\nSometimes, instead of chasing the demon of disease from their homes,\r\nsavages prefer to leave him in peaceable possession, while they\r\nthemselves take to flight and attempt to prevent him from following\r\nin their tracks. Thus when the Patagonians were attacked by\r\nsmall-pox, which they attributed to the machinations of an evil\r\nspirit, they used to abandon their sick and flee, slashing the air\r\nwith their weapons and throwing water about in order to keep off the\r\ndreadful pursuer; and when after several days\' march they reached a\r\nplace where they hoped to be beyond his reach, they used by way of\r\nprecaution to plant all their cutting weapons with the sharp edges\r\nturned towards the quarter from which they had come, as if they were\r\nrepelling a charge of cavalry. Similarly, when the Lules or\r\nTonocotes Indians of the Gran Chaco were attacked by an epidemic,\r\nthey regularly sought to evade it by flight, but in so doing they\r\nalways followed a sinuous, not a straight, course; because they said\r\nthat when the disease made after them he would be so exhausted by\r\nthe turnings and windings of the route that he would never be able\r\nto come up with them. When the Indians of New Mexico were decimated\r\nby smallpox or other infectious disease, they used to shift their\r\nquarters every day, retreating into the most sequestered parts of\r\nthe mountains and choosing the thorniest thickets they could find,\r\nin the hope that the smallpox would be too afraid of scratching\r\nhimself on the thorns to follow them. When some Chins on a visit to\r\nRangoon were attacked by cholera, they went about with drawn swords\r\nto scare away the demon, and they spent the day hiding under bushes\r\nso that he might not be able to find them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The Periodic Expulsion of Evils\r\n\r\nTHE EXPULSION of evils, from being occasional, tends to become\r\nperiodic. It comes to be thought desirable to have a general\r\nriddance of evil spirits at fixed times, usually once a year, in\r\norder that the people may make a fresh start in life, freed from all\r\nthe malignant influences which have been long accumulating about\r\nthem. Some of the Australian blacks annually expelled the ghosts of\r\nthe dead from their territory. The ceremony was witnessed by the\r\nRev. W. Ridley on the banks of the River Barwan. "A chorus of\r\ntwenty, old and young, were singing and beating time with\r\nboomerangs. . . . Suddenly, from under a sheet of bark darted a man\r\nwith his body whitened by pipeclay, his head and face coloured with\r\nlines of red and yellow, and a tuft of feathers fixed by means of a\r\nstick two feet above the crown of his head. He stood twenty minutes\r\nperfectly still, gazing upwards. An aboriginal who stood by told me\r\nhe was looking for the ghosts of dead men. At last he began to move\r\nvery slowly, and soon rushed to and fro at full speed, flourishing a\r\nbranch as if to drive away some foes invisible to us. When I thought\r\nthis pantomime must be almost over, ten more, similarly adorned,\r\nsuddenly appeared from behind the trees, and the whole party joined\r\nin a brisk conflict with their mysterious assailants. . . . At last,\r\nafter some rapid evolutions in which they put forth all their\r\nstrength, they rested from the exciting toil which they had kept up\r\nall night and for some hours after sunrise; they seemed satisfied\r\nthat the ghosts were driven away for twelve months. They were\r\nperforming the same ceremony at every station along the river, and I\r\nam told it is an annual custom."\r\n\r\nCertain seasons of the year mark themselves naturally out as\r\nappropriate moments for a general expulsion of devils. Such a moment\r\noccurs towards the close of an Arctic winter, when the sun reappears\r\non the horizon after an absence of weeks or months. Accordingly, at\r\nPoint Barrow, the most northerly extremity of Alaska, and nearly of\r\nAmerica, the Esquimaux choose the moment of the sun\'s reappearance\r\nto hunt the mischievous spirit Tu\xf1a from every house. The ceremony\r\nwas witnessed by the members of the United States Polar Expedition,\r\nwho wintered at Point Barrow. A fire was built in front of the\r\ncouncil-house, and an old woman was posted at the entrance to every\r\nhouse. The men gathered round the council-house while the young\r\nwomen and girls drove the spirit out of every house with their\r\nknives, stabbing viciously under the bunk and deer-skins, and\r\ncalling upon Tu\xf1a to be gone. When they thought he had been driven\r\nout of every hole and corner, they thrust him down through the hole\r\nin the floor and chased him into the open air with loud cries and\r\nfrantic gestures. Meanwhile the old woman at the entrance of the\r\nhouse made passes with a long knife in the air to keep him from\r\nreturning. Each party drove the spirit towards the fire and invited\r\nhim to go into it. All were by this time drawn up in a semicircle\r\nround the fire, when several of the leading men made specific\r\ncharges against the spirit; and each after his speech brushed his\r\nclothes violently, calling on the spirit to leave him and go into\r\nthe fire. Two men now stepped forward with rifles loaded with blank\r\ncartridges, while a third brought a vessel of urine and flung it on\r\nthe flames. At the same time one of the men fired a shot into the\r\nfire; and as the cloud of steam rose it received the other shot,\r\nwhich was supposed to finish Tun\xf1a for the time being.\r\n\r\nIn late autumn, when storms rage over the land and break the icy\r\nfetters by which the frozen sea is as yet but slightly bound, when\r\nthe loosened floes are driven against each other and break with loud\r\ncrashes, and when the cakes of ice are piled in wild disorder one\r\nupon another, the Esquimaux of Baffin Land fancy they hear the\r\nvoices of the spirits who people the mischief-laden air. Then the\r\nghosts of the dead knock wildly at the huts, which they cannot\r\nenter, and woe to the hapless wight whom they catch; he soon sickens\r\nand dies. Then the phantom of a huge hairless dog pursues the real\r\ndogs, which expire in convulsions and cramps at sight of him. All\r\nthe countless spirits of evil are abroad striving to bring sickness\r\nand death, foul weather and failure in hunting on the Esquimaux.\r\nMost dreaded of all these spectral visitants are Sedna, mistress of\r\nthe nether world, and her father, to whose share dead Esquimaux\r\nfall. While the other spirits fill the air and the water, she rises\r\nfrom under ground. It is then a busy season for the wizards. In\r\nevery house you may hear them singing and praying, while they\r\nconjure the spirits, seated in a mystic gloom at the back of the\r\nhut, which is dimly lit by a lamp burning low. The hardest task of\r\nall is to drive away Sedna, and this is reserved for the most\r\npowerful enchanter. A rope is coiled on the floor of a large hut in\r\nsuch a way as to leave a small opening at the top, which represents\r\nthe breathing hole of a seal. Two enchanters stand beside it, one of\r\nthem grasping a spear as if he were watching a seal-hole in winter,\r\nthe other holding the harpoon-line. A third sorcerer sits at the\r\nback of the hut chanting a magic song to lure Sedna to the spot. Now\r\nshe is heard approaching under the floor of the hut, breathing\r\nheavily; now she emerges at the hole; now she is harpooned and sinks\r\naway in angry haste, dragging the harpoon with her, while the two\r\nmen hold on to the line with all their might. The struggle is\r\nsevere, but at last by a desperate wrench she tears herself away and\r\nreturns to her dwelling in Adlivun. When the harpoon is drawn up out\r\nof the hole it is found to be splashed with blood, which the\r\nenchanters proudly exhibit as a proof of their prowess. Thus Sedna\r\nand the other evil spirits are at last driven away, and next day a\r\ngreat festival is celebrated by old and young in honour of the\r\nevent. But they must still be cautious, for the wounded Sedna is\r\nfurious and will seize any one she may find outside of his hut; so\r\nthey all wear amulets on the top of their hoods to protect\r\nthemselves against her. These amulets consist of pieces of the first\r\ngarments that they wore after birth.\r\n\r\nThe Iroquois inaugurated the new year in January, February, or March\r\n(the time varied) with a "festival of dreams" like that which the\r\nHurons observed on special occasions. The whole ceremonies lasted\r\nseveral days, or even weeks, and formed a kind of saturnalia. Men\r\nand women, variously disguised, went from wigwam to wigwam smashing\r\nand throwing down whatever they came across. It was a time of\r\ngeneral license; the people were supposed to be out of their senses,\r\nand therefore not to be responsible for what they did. Accordingly,\r\nmany seized the opportunity of paying off old scores by belabouring\r\nobnoxious persons, drenching them with ice-cold water, and covering\r\nthem with filth or hot ashes. Others seized burning brands or coals\r\nand flung them at the heads of the first persons they met. The only\r\nway of escaping from these persecutors was to guess what they had\r\ndreamed of. On one day of the festival the ceremony of driving away\r\nevil spirits from the village took place. Men clothed in the skins\r\nof wild beasts, their faces covered with hideous masks, and their\r\nhands with the shell of the tortoise, went from hut to hut making\r\nfrightful noises; in every hut they took the fuel from the fire and\r\nscattered the embers and ashes about the floor with their hands. The\r\ngeneral confession of sins which preceded the festival was probably\r\na preparation for the public expulsion of evil influences; it was a\r\nway of stripping the people of their moral burdens, that these might\r\nbe collected and cast out.\r\n\r\nIn September the Incas of Peru celebrated a festival called Situa,\r\nthe object of which was to banish from the capital and its vicinity\r\nall disease and trouble. The festival fell in September because the\r\nrains begin about this time, and with the first rains there was\r\ngenerally much sickness. As a preparation for the festival the\r\npeople fasted on the first day of the moon after the autumnal\r\nequinox. Having fasted during the day, and the night being come,\r\nthey baked a coarse paste of maize. This paste was made of two\r\nsorts. One was kneaded with the blood of children aged from five to\r\nten years, the blood being obtained by bleeding the children between\r\nthe eyebrows. These two kinds of paste were baked separately,\r\nbecause they were for different uses. Each family assembled at the\r\nhouse of the eldest brother to celebrate the feast; and those who\r\nhad no elder brother went to the house of their next relation of\r\ngreater age. On the same night all who had fasted during the day\r\nwashed their bodies, and taking a little of the blood-kneaded paste,\r\nrubbed it over their head, face, breast, shoulders, arms and legs.\r\nThey did this in order that the paste might take away all their\r\ninfirmities. After this the head of the family anointed the\r\nthreshold with the same paste, and left it there as a token that the\r\ninmates of the house had performed their ablutions and cleansed\r\ntheir bodies. Meantime the High Priest performed the same ceremonies\r\nin the temple of the Sun. As soon as the Sun rose, all the people\r\nworshipped and besought him to drive all evils out of the city, and\r\nthen they broke their fast with the paste that had been kneaded\r\nwithout blood. When they had paid their worship and broken their\r\nfast, which they did at a stated hour, in order that all might adore\r\nthe Sun as one man, an Inca of the blood royal came forth from the\r\nfortress, as a messenger of the Sun, richly dressed, with his mantle\r\ngirded round his body, and a lance in his hand. The lance was decked\r\nwith feathers of many hues, extending from the blade to the socket,\r\nand fastened with rings of gold. He ran down the hill from the\r\nfortress brandishing his lance, till he reached the centre of the\r\ngreat square, where stood the golden urn, like a fountain, that was\r\nused for the sacrifice of the fermented juice of the maize. Here\r\nfour other Incas of the blood royal awaited him, each with a lance\r\nin his hand, and his mantle girded up to run. The messenger touched\r\ntheir four lances with his lance, and told them that the Sun bade\r\nthem, as his messengers, drive the evils out of the city. The four\r\nIncas then separated and ran down the four royal roads which led out\r\nof the city to the four quarters of the world. While they ran, all\r\nthe people, great and small, came to the doors of their houses, and\r\nwith great shouts of joy and gladness shook their clothes, as if\r\nthey were shaking off dust, while they cried, "Let the evils be\r\ngone. How greatly desired has this festival been by us. O Creator of\r\nall things, permit us to reach another year, that we may see another\r\nfeast like this." After they had shaken their clothes, they passed\r\ntheir hands over their heads, faces, arms, and legs, as if in the\r\nact of washing. All this was done to drive the evils out of their\r\nhouses, that the messengers of the Sun might banish them from the\r\ncity; and it was done not only in the streets through which the\r\nIncas ran, but generally in all quarters of the city. Moreover, they\r\nall danced, the Inca himself amongst them, and bathed in the rivers\r\nand fountains, saying that their maladies would come out of them.\r\nThen they took great torches of straw, bound round with cords. These\r\nthey lighted, and passed from one to the other, striking each other\r\nwith them, and saying, "Let all harm go away." Meanwhile the runners\r\nran with their lances for a quarter of a league outside the city,\r\nwhere they found four other Incas ready, who received the lances\r\nfrom their hands and ran with them. Thus the lances were carried by\r\nrelays of runners for a distance of five or six leagues, at the end\r\nof which the runners washed themselves and their weapons in rivers,\r\nand set up the lances, in sign of a boundary within which the\r\nbanished evils might not return.\r\n\r\nThe negroes of Guinea annually banish the devil from all their towns\r\nwith much ceremony at a time set apart for the purpose. At Axim, on\r\nthe Gold Coast, this annual expulsion is preceded by a feast of\r\neight days, during which mirth and jollity, skipping, dancing, and\r\nsinging prevail, and "a perfect lampooning liberty is allowed, and\r\nscandal so highly exalted, that they may freely sing of all the\r\nfaults, villanies, and frauds of their superiors as well as\r\ninferiors, without punishment, or so much as the least\r\ninterruption." On the eighth day they hunt out the devil with a\r\ndismal cry, running after him and pelting him with sticks, stones,\r\nand whatever comes to hand. When they have driven him far enough out\r\nof the town, they all return. In this way he is expelled from more\r\nthan a hundred towns at the same time. To make sure that he does not\r\nreturn to their houses, the women wash and scour all their wooden\r\nand earthen vessels, "to free them from all uncleanness and the\r\ndevil."\r\n\r\nAt Cape Coast Castle, on the Gold Coast, the ceremony was witnessed\r\non the ninth of October, 1844, by an Englishman, who has described\r\nit as follows: "To-night the annual custom of driving the evil\r\nspirit, Abonsam, out of the town has taken place. As soon as the\r\neight o\'clock gun fired in the fort the people began firing muskets\r\nin their houses, turning all their furniture out of doors, beating\r\nabout in every corner of the rooms with sticks, etc., and screaming\r\nas loudly as possible, in order to frighten the devil. Being driven\r\nout of the houses, as they imagine, they sallied forth into the\r\nstreets, throwing lighted torches about, shouting, screaming,\r\nbeating sticks together, rattling old pans, making the most horrid\r\nnoise, in order to drive him out of the town into the sea. The\r\ncustom is preceded by four weeks\' dead silence; no gun is allowed to\r\nbe fired, no drum to be beaten, no palaver to be made between man\r\nand man. If, during these weeks, two natives should disagree and\r\nmake a noise in the town, they are immediately taken before the king\r\nand fined heavily. If a dog or pig, sheep or goat be found at large\r\nin the street, it may be killed, or taken by anyone, the former\r\nowner not being allowed to demand any compensation. This silence is\r\ndesigned to deceive Abonsam, that, being off his guard, he may be\r\ntaken by surprise, and frightened out of the place. If anyone die\r\nduring the silence, his relatives are not allowed to weep until the\r\nfour weeks have been completed."\r\n\r\nSometimes the date of the annual expulsion of devils is fixed with\r\nreference to the agricultural seasons. Thus among the Hos of\r\nTogoland, in West Africa, the expulsion is performed annually before\r\nthe people partake of the new yams. The chiefs summon the priests\r\nand magicians and tell them that the people are now to eat the new\r\nyams and be merry, therefore they must cleanse the town and remove\r\nthe evils. Accordingly the evil spirits, witches, and all the ills\r\nthat infest the people are conjured into bundles of leaves and\r\ncreepers, fastened to poles, which are carried away and set up in\r\nthe earth on various roads outside the town. During the following\r\nnight no fire may be lit and no food eaten. Next morning the women\r\nsweep out their hearths and houses, and deposit the sweepings on\r\nbroken wooden plates. Then the people pray, saying, "All ye\r\nsicknesses that are in our body and plague us, we are come to-day to\r\nthrow you out." Thereupon they run as fast as they can in the\r\ndirection of Mount Adaklu, smiting their mouths and screaming, "Out\r\nto-day! Out to-day! That which kills anybody, out to-day! Ye evil\r\nspirits, out to-day! and all that causes our heads to ache, out\r\nto-day! Anlo and Adaklu are the places whither all ill shall betake\r\nitself!" When they have come to a certain tree on Mount Adaklu, they\r\nthrow everything away and return home.\r\n\r\nAt Kiriwina, in South-Eastern New Guinea, when the new yams had been\r\nharvested, the people feasted and danced for many days, and a great\r\ndeal of property, such as armlets, native money, and so forth, was\r\ndisplayed conspicuously on a platform erected for the purpose. When\r\nthe festivities were over, all the people gathered together and\r\nexpelled the spirits from the village by shouting, beating the posts\r\nof the houses, and overturning everything under which a wily spirit\r\nmight be supposed to lurk. The explanation which the people gave to\r\na missionary was that they had entertained and feasted the spirits\r\nand provided them with riches, and it was now time for them to take\r\ntheir departure. Had they not seen the dances, and heard the songs,\r\nand gorged themselves on the souls of the yams, and appropriated the\r\nsouls of the money and all the other fine things set out on the\r\nplatform? What more could the spirits want? So out they must go.\r\n\r\nAmong the Hos of North-Eastern India the great festival of the year\r\nis the harvest home, held in January, when the granaries are full of\r\ngrain, and the people, to use their own expression, are full of\r\ndevilry. "They have a strange notion that at this period, men and\r\nwomen are so overcharged with vicious propensities, that it is\r\nabsolutely necessary for the safety of the person to let off steam\r\nby allowing for a time full vent to the passions." The ceremonies\r\nopen with a sacrifice to the village god of three fowls, a cock and\r\ntwo hens, one of which must be black. Along with them are offered\r\nflowers of the palas tree (_Butea frondosa_), bread made from\r\nrice-flour, and sesamum seeds. These offerings are presented by the\r\nvillage priest, who prays that during the year about to begin they\r\nand their children may be preserved from all misfortune and\r\nsickness, and that they may have seasonable rain and good crops.\r\nPrayer is also made in some places for the souls of the dead. At\r\nthis time an evil spirit is supposed to infest the place, and to get\r\nrid of it men, women, and children go in procession round and\r\nthrough every part of the village with sticks in their hands, as if\r\nbeating for game, singing a wild chant, and shouting vociferously,\r\ntill they feel assured that the evil spirit must have fled. Then\r\nthey give themselves up to feasting and drinking rice-beer, till\r\nthey are in a fit state for the wild debauch which follows. The\r\nfestival now "becomes a saturnale, during which servants forget\r\ntheir duty to their masters, children their reverence for parents,\r\nmen their respect for women, and women all notions of modesty,\r\ndelicacy, and gentleness; they become raging bacchantes." Usually\r\nthe Hos are quiet and reserved in manner, decorous and gentle to\r\nwomen. But during this festival "their natures appear to undergo a\r\ntemporary change. Sons and daughters revile their parents in gross\r\nlanguage, and parents their children; men and women become almost\r\nlike animals in the indulgence of their amorous propensities." The\r\nMundaris, kinsmen and neighbours of the Hos, keep the festival in\r\nmuch the same manner. "The resemblance to a Saturnale is very\r\ncomplete, as at this festival the farm labourers are feasted by\r\ntheir masters, and allowed the utmost freedom of speech in\r\naddressing them. It is the festival of the harvest home; the\r\ntermination of one year\'s toil, and a slight respite from it before\r\nthey commence again."\r\n\r\nAmongst some of the Hindoo Koosh tribes, as among the Hos and\r\nMundaris, the expulsion of devils takes place after harvest. When\r\nthe last crop of autumn has been got in, it is thought necessary to\r\ndrive away evil spirits from the granaries. A kind of porridge is\r\neaten, and the head of the family takes his matchlock and fires it\r\ninto the floor. Then, going outside, he sets to work loading and\r\nfiring till his powder-horn is exhausted, while all his neighbours\r\nare similarly employed. The next day is spent in rejoicings. In\r\nChitral this festival is called "devil-driving." On the other hand\r\nthe Khonds of India expel the devils at seed-time instead of at\r\nharvest. At this time they worship Pitteri Pennu, the god of\r\nincrease and of gain in every shape. On the first day of the\r\nfestival a rude car is made of a basket set upon a few sticks, tied\r\nupon the bamboo rollers for wheels. The priest takes this car first\r\nto the house of the lineal head of the tribe, to whom precedence is\r\ngiven in all ceremonies connected with agriculture. Here he receives\r\na little of each kind of seed and some feathers. He then takes the\r\ncar to all the other houses in the village, each of which\r\ncontributes the same things. Lastly, the car is conducted to a field\r\nwithout the village, attended by all the young men, who beat each\r\nother and strike the air violently with long sticks. The seed thus\r\ncarried out is called the share of the "evil spirits, spoilers of\r\nthe seed." "These are considered to be driven out with the car; and\r\nwhen it and its contents are abandoned to them, they are held to\r\nhave no excuse for interfering with the rest of the seed-corn."\r\n\r\nThe people of Bali, an island to the east of Java, have periodical\r\nexpulsions of devils upon a great scale. Generally the time chosen\r\nfor the expulsion is the day of the "dark moon" in the ninth month.\r\nWhen the demons have been long unmolested the country is said to be\r\n"warm," and the priest issues orders to expel them by force, lest\r\nthe whole of Bali should be rendered uninhabitable. On the day\r\nappointed the people of the village or district assemble at the\r\nprincipal temple. Here at a cross-road offerings are set out for the\r\ndevils. After prayers have been recited by the priests, the blast of\r\na horn summons the devils to partake of the meal which has been\r\nprepared for them. At the same time a number of men step forward and\r\nlight their torches at the holy lamp which burns before the chief\r\npriest. Immediately afterwards, followed by the bystanders, they\r\nspread in all directions and march through the streets and lanes\r\ncrying, "Depart! go away!" Wherever they pass, the people who have\r\nstayed at home hasten, by a deafening clatter on doors, beams,\r\nrice-blocks, and so forth, to take their share in the expulsion of\r\ndevils. Thus chased from the houses, the fiends flee to the banquet\r\nwhich has been set out for them; but here the priest receives them\r\nwith curses which finally drive them from the district. When the\r\nlast devil has taken his departure, the uproar is succeeded by a\r\ndead silence, which lasts during the next day also. The devils, it\r\nis thought, are anxious to return to their old homes, and in order\r\nto make them think that Bali is not Bali but some desert island, no\r\none may stir from his own abode for twenty-four hours. Even ordinary\r\nhousehold work, including cooking, is discontinued. Only the\r\nwatchmen may show themselves in the streets. Wreaths of thorns and\r\nleaves are hung at all the entrances to warn strangers from\r\nentering. Not till the third day is this state of siege raised, and\r\neven then it is forbidden to work at the rice-fields or to buy and\r\nsell in the market. Most people still stay at home, whiling away the\r\ntime with cards and dice.\r\n\r\nIn Tonquin a _theckydaw_ or general expulsion of maleyolent spirits\r\ncommonly took place once a year, especially if there was a great\r\nmortality amongst men, the elephants or horses of the general\'s\r\nstable, or the cattle of the country, "the cause of which they\r\nattribute to the malicious spirits of such men as have been put to\r\ndeath for treason, rebellion, and conspiring the death of the king,\r\ngeneral, or princes, and that in revenge of the punishment they have\r\nsuffered, they are bent to destroy everything and commit horrible\r\nviolence. To prevent which their superstition has suggested to them\r\nthe institution of this _theckydaw,_ as a proper means to drive the\r\ndevil away, and purge the country of evil spirits." The day\r\nappointed for the ceremony was generally the twenty-fifth of\r\nFebruary, one month after the beginning of the new year, which fell\r\non the twenty-fifth of January. The intermediate month was a season\r\nof feasting, merry-making of all kinds, and general licence. During\r\nthe whole month the great seal was kept shut up in a box, face\r\ndownwards, and the law was, as it were, laid asleep. All courts of\r\njustice were closed; debtors could not be seized; small crimes, such\r\nas petty larceny, fighting, and assault, escaped with impunity; only\r\ntreason and murder were taken account of and the malefactors\r\ndetained till the great seal should come into operation again. At\r\nthe close of the saturnalia the wicked spirits were driven away.\r\nGreat masses of troops and artillery having been drawn up with\r\nflying colours and all the pomp of war, "the general beginneth then\r\nto offer meat offerings to the criminal devils and malevolent\r\nspirits (for it is usual and customary likewise amongst them to\r\nfeast the condemned before their execution), inviting them to eat\r\nand drink, when presently he accuses them in a strange language, by\r\ncharacters and figures, etc., of many offences and crimes committed\r\nby them, as to their having disquieted the land, killed his\r\nelephants and horses, etc., for all which they justly deserve to be\r\nchastised and banished the country. Whereupon three great guns are\r\nfired as the last signal; upon which all the artillery and musquets\r\nare discharged, that, by their most terrible noise the devils may be\r\ndriven away; and they are so blind as to believe for certain, that\r\nthey really and effectually put them to flight."\r\n\r\nIn Cambodia the expulsion of evil spirits took place in March. Bits\r\nof broken statues and stones, considered as the abode of the demons,\r\nwere collected and brought to the capital. Here as many elephants\r\nwere collected as could be got together. On the evening of the full\r\nmoon volleys of musketry were fired and the elephants charged\r\nfuriously to put the devils to flight. The ceremony was performed on\r\nthree successive days. In Siam the banishment of demons is annually\r\ncarried into effect on the last day of the old year. A signal gun is\r\nfired from the palace; it is answered from the next station, and so\r\non from station to station, till the firing has reached the outer\r\ngate of the city. Thus the demons are driven out step by step. As\r\nsoon as this is done a consecrated rope is fastened round the\r\ncircuit of the city walls to prevent the banished demons from\r\nreturning. The rope is made of tough couch-grass and is painted in\r\nalternate stripes of red, yellow, and blue.\r\n\r\nAnnual expulsions of demons, witches, or evil influences appear to\r\nhave been common among the heathen of Europe, if we may judge from\r\nthe relics of such customs among their descendants at the present\r\nday. Thus among the heathen Wotyaks, a Finnish people of Eastern\r\nRussia, all the young girls of the village assemble on the last day\r\nof the year or on New Year\'s Day, armed with sticks, the ends of\r\nwhich are split in nine places. With these they beat every corner of\r\nthe house and yard, saying, "We are driving Satan out of the\r\nvillage." Afterwards the sticks are thrown into the river below the\r\nvillage, and as they float down stream Satan goes with them to the\r\nnext village, from which he must be driven out in turn. In some\r\nvillages the expulsion is managed otherwise. The unmarried men\r\nreceive from every house in the village groats, flesh, and brandy.\r\nThese they take to the fields, light a fire under a fir-tree, boil\r\nthe groats, and eat of the food they have brought with them, after\r\npronouncing the words, "Go away into the wilderness, come not into\r\nthe house." Then they return to the village and enter every house\r\nwhere there are young women. They take hold of the young women and\r\nthrow them into the snow, saying, "May the spirits of disease leave\r\nyou." The remains of the groats and the other food are then\r\ndistributed among all the houses in proportion to the amount that\r\neach contributed, and each family consumes its share. According to a\r\nWotyak of the Malmyz district the young men throw into the snow\r\nwhomever they find in the houses, and this is called "driving out\r\nSatan"; moreover, some of the boiled groats are cast into the fire\r\nwith the words, "O god, afflict us not with sickness and pestilence,\r\ngive us not up as a prey to the spirits of the wood." But the most\r\nantique form of the ceremony is that observed by the Wotyaks of the\r\nKasan Government. First of all a sacrifice is offered to the Devil\r\nat noon. Then all the men assemble on horseback in the centre of the\r\nvillage, and decide with which house they shall begin. When this\r\nquestion, which often gives rise to hot disputes, is settled, they\r\ntether their horses to the paling, and arm themselves with whips,\r\nclubs of lime-wood and bundles of lighted twigs. The lighted twigs\r\nare believed to have the greatest terrors for Satan. Thus armed,\r\nthey proceed with frightful cries to beat every corner of the house\r\nand yard, then shut the door, and spit at the ejected fiend. So they\r\ngo from house to house, till the Devil has been driven from every\r\none. Then they mount their horses and ride out of the village,\r\nyelling wildly and brandishing their clubs in every direction.\r\nOutside of the village they fling away the clubs and spit once more\r\nat the Devil. The Cheremiss, another Finnish people of Eastern\r\nRussia, chase Satan from their dwellings by beating the walls with\r\ncudgels of lime-wood. For the same purpose they fire guns, stab the\r\nground with knives, and insert burning chips of wood in the\r\ncrevices. Also they leap over bonfires, shaking out their garments\r\nas they do so; and in some districts they blow on long trumpets of\r\nlime-tree bark to frighten him away. When he has fled to the wood,\r\nthey pelt the trees with some of the cheese-cakes and eggs which\r\nfurnished the feast.\r\n\r\nIn Christian Europe the old heathen custom of expelling the powers\r\nof evil at certain times of the year has survived to modern times.\r\nThus in some villages of Calabria the month of March is inaugurated\r\nwith the expulsion of the witches. It takes place at night to the\r\nsound of the church bells, the people running about the streets and\r\ncrying, "March is come." They say that the witches roam about in\r\nMarch, and the ceremony is repeated every Friday evening during the\r\nmonth. Often, as might have been anticipated, the ancient pagan rite\r\nhas attached itself to church festivals. In Albania on Easter Eve\r\nthe young people light torches of resinous wood and march in\r\nprocession, swinging them, through the village. At last they throw\r\nthe torches into the river, crying, "Ha, Kore! we throw you into the\r\nriver, like these torches, that you may never return." Silesian\r\npeasants believe that on Good Friday the witches go their rounds and\r\nhave great power for mischief. Hence about Oels, near Strehlitz, the\r\npeople on that day arm themselves with old brooms and drive the\r\nwitches from house and home, from farmyard and cattle-stall, making\r\na great uproar and clatter as they do so.\r\n\r\nIn Central Europe the favourite time for expelling the witches is,\r\nor was, Walpurgis Night, the Eve of May Day, when the baleful powers\r\nof these mischievous beings were supposed to be at their height. In\r\nthe Tyrol, for example, as in other places, the expulsion of the\r\npowers of evil at this season goes by the name of "Burning out the\r\nWitches." It takes place on May Day, but people have been busy with\r\ntheir preparations for days before. On a Thursday at midnight\r\nbundles are made up of resinous splinters, black and red spotted\r\nhemlock, caperspurge, rosemary, and twigs of the sloe. These are\r\nkept and burned on May Day by men who must first have received\r\nplenary absolution from the Church. On the last three days of April\r\nall the houses are cleansed and fumigated with juniper berries and\r\nrue. On May Day, when the evening bell has rung and the twilight is\r\nfalling, the ceremony of "Burning out the Witches" begins. Men and\r\nboys make a racket with whips, bells, pots, and pans; the women\r\ncarry censers; the dogs are unchained and run barking and yelping\r\nabout. As soon as the church bells begin to ring, the bundles of\r\ntwigs, fastened on poles, are set on fire and the incense is\r\nignited. Then all the house-bells and dinner-bells are rung, pots\r\nand pans are clashed, dogs bark, every one must make a noise. And\r\namid this hubbub all scream at the pitch of their voices:\r\n\r\n\r\n"_Witch flee, flee from here, or it will go ill with thee._"\r\n\r\n\r\nThen they run seven times round the houses, the yards, and the\r\nvillage. So the witches are smoked out of their lurking-places and\r\ndriven away. The custom of expelling the witches on Walpurgis Night\r\nis still, or was down to recent years, observed in many parts of\r\nBavaria and among the Germans of Bohemia. Thus in the B\xf6hmer-wald\r\nMountains all the young fellows of the village assemble after sunset\r\non some height, especially at a cross-road, and crack whips for a\r\nwhile in unison with all their strength. This drives away the\r\nwitches; for so far as the sound of the whips is heard, these\r\nmaleficent beings can do no harm. In some places, while the young\r\nmen are cracking their whips, the herdsmen wind their horns, and the\r\nlong-drawn notes, heard far off in the silence of night, are very\r\neffectual for banning the witches.\r\n\r\nAnother witching time is the period of twelve days between Christmas\r\nand Epiphany. Hence in some parts of Silesia the people burn\r\npine-resin all night long between Christmas and the New Year in\r\norder that the pungent smoke may drive witches and evil spirits far\r\naway from house and homestead; and on Christmas Eve and New Year\'s\r\nEve they fire shots over fields and meadows, into shrubs and trees,\r\nand wrap straw round the fruit-trees, to prevent the spirits from\r\ndoing them harm. On New Year\'s Eve, which is Saint Sylvester\'s Day,\r\nBohemian lads, armed with guns, form themselves into circles and\r\nfire thrice into the air. This is called "Shooting the Witches" and\r\nis supposed to frighten the witches away. The last of the mystic\r\ntwelve days is Epiphany or Twelfth Night, and it has been selected\r\nas a proper season for the expulsion of the powers of evil in\r\nvarious parts of Europe. Thus at Brunnen, on the Lake of Lucerne,\r\nboys go about in procession on Twelfth Night carrying torches and\r\nmaking a great noise with horns, bells, whips, and so forth to\r\nfrighten away two female spirits of the wood, Strudeli and\r\nStr\xe4tteli. The people think that if they do not make enough noise,\r\nthere will be little fruit that year. Again, in Labrugui\xe8re, a\r\ncanton of Southern France, on the eve of Twelfth Day the people run\r\nthrough the streets, jangling bells, clattering kettles, and doing\r\neverything to make a discordant noise. Then by the light of torches\r\nand blazing faggots they set up a prodigious hue and cry, an\r\near-splitting uproar, hoping thereby to chase all the wandering\r\nghosts and devils from the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVII. Public Scapegoats\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Expulsion of Embodied Evils\r\n\r\nTHUS far we have dealt with that class of the general expulsion of\r\nevils which I have called direct or immediate. In this class the\r\nevils are invisible, at least to common eyes, and the mode of\r\ndeliverance consists for the most part in beating the empty air and\r\nraising such a hubbub as may scare the mischievous spirits and put\r\nthem to flight. It remains to illustrate the second class of\r\nexpulsions, in which the evil influences are embodied in a visible\r\nform or are at least supposed to be loaded upon a material medium,\r\nwhich acts as a vehicle to draw them off from the people, village,\r\nor town.\r\n\r\nThe Pomos of California celebrate an expulsion of devils every seven\r\nyears, at which the devils are represented by disguised men. "Twenty\r\nor thirty men array themselves in harlequin rig and barbaric paint,\r\nand put vessels of pitch on their heads; then they secretly go out\r\ninto the surrounding mountains. These are to personify the devils. A\r\nherald goes up to the top of the assembly-house, and makes a speech\r\nto the multitude. At a signal agreed upon in the evening the\r\nmasqueraders come in from the mountains, with the vessels of pitch\r\nflaming on their heads, and with all the frightful accessories of\r\nnoise, motion, and costume which the savage mind can devise in\r\nrepresentation of demons. The terrified women and children flee for\r\nlife, the men huddle them inside a circle, and, on the principle of\r\nfighting the devil with fire, they swing blazing firebrands in the\r\nair, yell, whoop, and make frantic dashes at the marauding and\r\nbloodthirsty devils, so creating a terrific spectacle, and striking\r\ngreat fear into the hearts of the assembled hundreds of women, who\r\nare screaming and fainting and clinging to their valorous\r\nprotectors. Finally the devils succeed in getting into the\r\nassembly-house, and the bravest of the men enter and hold a parley\r\nwith them. As a conclusion of the whole farce, the men summon\r\ncourage, the devils are expelled from the assembly-house, and with a\r\nprodigious row and racket of sham fighting are chased away into the\r\nmountains." In spring, as soon as the willow-leaves were full grown\r\non the banks of the river, the Mandan Indians celebrated their great\r\nannual festival, one of the features of which was the expulsion of\r\nthe devil. A man, painted black to represent the devil, entered the\r\nvillage from the prairie, chased and frightened the women, and acted\r\nthe part of a buffalo bull in the buffalo dance, the object of which\r\nwas to ensure a plentiful supply of buffaloes during the ensuing\r\nyear. Finally he was chased from the village, the women pursuing him\r\nwith hisses and gibes, beating him with sticks, and pelting him with\r\ndirt.\r\n\r\nSome of the native tribes of Central Queensland believe in a noxious\r\nbeing called Molonga, who prowls unseen and would kill men and\r\nviolate women if certain ceremonies were not performed. These\r\nceremonies last for five nights and consist of dances, in which only\r\nmen, fantastically painted and adorned, take part. On the fifth\r\nnight Molonga himself, personified by a man tricked out with red\r\nochre and feathers and carrying a long feather-tipped spear, rushes\r\nforth from the darkness at the spectators and makes as if he would\r\nrun them through. Great is the excitement, loud are the shrieks and\r\nshouts, but after another feigned attack the demon vanishes in the\r\ngloom. On the last night of the year the palace of the Kings of\r\nCambodia is purged of devils. Men painted as fiends are chased by\r\nelephants about the palace courts. When they have been expelled, a\r\nconsecrated thread of cotton is stretched round the palace to keep\r\nthem out. In Munzerabad, a district of Mysore in Southern India,\r\nwhen cholera or smallpox has broken out in a parish, the inhabitants\r\nassemble and conjure the demon of the disease into a wooden image,\r\nwhich they carry, generally at midnight, into the next parish. The\r\ninhabitants of that parish in like manner pass the image on to their\r\nneighbours, and thus the demon is expelled from one village after\r\nanother, until he comes to the bank of a river into which he is\r\nfinally thrown.\r\n\r\nOftener, however, the expelled demons are not represented at all,\r\nbut are understood to be present invisibly in the material and\r\nvisible vehicle which conveys them away. Here, again, it will be\r\nconvenient to distinguish between occasional and periodical\r\nexpulsions. We begin with the former.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Occasional Expulsion of Evils in a Material Vehicle\r\n\r\nTHE VEHICLE which conveys away the demons may be of various kinds. A\r\ncommon one is a little ship or boat. Thus, in the southern district\r\nof the island of Ceram, when a whole village suffers from sickness,\r\na small ship is made and filled with rice, tobacco, eggs, and so\r\nforth, which have been contributed by all the people. A little sail\r\nis hoisted on the ship. When all is ready, a man calls out in a very\r\nloud voice, "O all ye sicknesses, ye smallpoxes, agues, measles,\r\netc., who have visited us so long and wasted us so sorely, but who\r\nnow cease to plague us, we have made ready this ship for you, and we\r\nhave furnished you with provender sufficient for the voyage. Ye\r\nshall have no lack of food nor of betel-leaves nor of areca nuts nor\r\nof tobacco. Depart, and sail away from us directly; never come near\r\nus again; but go to a land which is far from here. Let all the tides\r\nand winds waft you speedily thither, and so convey you thither that\r\nfor the time to come we may live sound and well, and that we may\r\nnever see the sun rise on you again." Then ten or twelve men carry\r\nthe vessel to the shore, and let it drift away with the land-breeze,\r\nfeeling convinced that they are free from sickness for ever, or at\r\nleast till the next time. If sickness attacks them again, they are\r\nsure it is not the same sickness, but a different one, which in due\r\ntime they dismiss in the same manner. When the demon-laden bark is\r\nlost to sight, the bearers return to the village, whereupon a man\r\ncries out, "The sicknesses are now gone, vanished, expelled, and\r\nsailed away." At this all the people come running out of their\r\nhouses, passing the word from one to the other with great joy,\r\nbeating on gongs and on tinkling instruments.\r\n\r\nSimilar ceremonies are commonly resorted to in other East Indian\r\nislands. Thus in Timor-laut, to mislead the demons who are causing\r\nsickness, a small proa, containing the image of a man and\r\nprovisioned for a long voyage, is allowed to drift away with wind\r\nand tide. As it is being launched, the people cry, "O sickness, go\r\nfrom here; turn back; what do you here in this poor land?" Three\r\ndays after this ceremony a pig is killed, and part of the flesh is\r\noffered to Dudilaa, who lives in the sun. One of the oldest men\r\nsays, "Old sir, I beseech you make well the grand-children,\r\nchildren, women, and men, that we may be able to eat pork and rice\r\nand to drink palmwine. I will keep my promise. Eat your share, and\r\nmake all the people in the village well." If the proa is stranded at\r\nany inhabited spot, the sickness will break out there. Hence a\r\nstranded proa excites much alarm amongst the coast population, and\r\nthey immediately burn it, because demons fly from fire. In the\r\nisland of Buru the proa which carries away the demons of disease is\r\nabout twenty feet long, rigged out with sails, oars, anchor, and so\r\non, and well stocked with provisions. For a day and a night the\r\npeople beat gongs and drums, and rush about to frighten the demons.\r\nNext morning ten stalwart young men strike the people with branches,\r\nwhich have been previously dipped in an earthen pot of water. As\r\nsoon as they have done so, they run down to the beach, put the\r\nbranches on board the proa, launch another boat in great haste, and\r\ntow the disease-burdened bark far out to sea. There they cast it\r\noff, and one of them calls out, "Grandfather Smallpox, go away--go\r\nwillingly away--go visit another land; we have made you food ready\r\nfor the voyage, we have now nothing more to give." When they have\r\nlanded, all the people bathe together in the sea. In this ceremony\r\nthe reason for striking the people with the branches is clearly to\r\nrid them of the disease-demons, which are then supposed to be\r\ntransferred to the branches. Hence the haste with which the branches\r\nare deposited in the proa and towed away to sea. So in the inland\r\ndistricts of Ceram, when smallpox or other sickness is raging, the\r\npriest strikes all the houses with consecrated branches, which are\r\nthen thrown into the river, to be carried down to the sea; exactly\r\nas amongst the Wotyaks of Russia the sticks which have been used for\r\nexpelling the devils from the village are thrown into the river,\r\nthat the current may sweep the baleful burden away. The plan of\r\nputting puppets in the boat to represent sick persons, in order to\r\nlure the demons after them, is not uncommon. For example, most of\r\nthe pagan tribes on the coast of Borneo seek to drive away epidemic\r\ndisease as follows. They carve one or more rough human images from\r\nthe pith of the sago palm and place them on a small raft or boat or\r\nfull-rigged Malay ship together with rice and other food. The boat\r\nis decked with blossoms of the areca palm and with ribbons made from\r\nits leaves, and thus adorned the little craft is allowed to float\r\nout to sea with the ebb-tide, bearing, as the people fondly think or\r\nhope, the sickness away with it.\r\n\r\nOften the vehicle which carries away the collected demons or ills of\r\na whole community is an animal or scapegoat. In the Central\r\nProvinces of India, when cholera breaks out in a village, every one\r\nretires after sunset to his house. The priests then parade the\r\nstreets, taking from the roof of each house a straw, which is burnt\r\nwith an offering of rice, ghee, and turmeric, at some shrine to the\r\neast of the village. Chickens daubed with vermilion are driven away\r\nin the direction of the smoke, and are believed to carry the disease\r\nwith them. If they fail, goats are tried, and last of all pigs. When\r\ncholera rages among the Bhars, Mallans, and Kurmis of India, they\r\ntake a goat or a buffalo--in either case the animal must be a\r\nfemale, and as black as possible--then having tied some grain,\r\ncloves, and red lead in a yellow cloth on its back they turn it out\r\nof the village. The animal is conducted beyond the boundary and not\r\nallowed to return. Sometimes the buffalo is marked with a red\r\npigment and driven to the next village, where he carries the plague\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Dinkas, a pastoral people of the White Nile, each family\r\npossesses a sacred cow. When the country is threatened with war,\r\nfamine, or any other public calamity, the chiefs of the village\r\nrequire a particular family to surrender their sacred cow to serve\r\nas a scapegoat. The animal is driven by the women to the brink of\r\nthe river and across it to the other bank, there to wander in the\r\nwilderness and fall a prey to ravening beasts. Then the women return\r\nin silence and without looking behind them; were they to cast a\r\nbackward glance, they imagine that the ceremony would have no\r\neffect. In 1857, when the Aymara Indians of Bolivia and Peru were\r\nsuffering from a plague, they loaded a black llama with the clothes\r\nof the plague-stricken people, sprinkled brandy on the clothes, and\r\nthen turned the animal loose on the mountains, hoping that it would\r\ncarry the pest away with it.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the scapegoat is a man. For example, from time to time\r\nthe gods used to warn the King of Uganda that his foes the Banyoro\r\nwere working magic against him and his people to make them die of\r\ndisease. To avert such a catastrophe the king would send a scapegoat\r\nto the frontier of Bunyoro, the land of the enemy. The scapegoat\r\nconsisted of either a man and a boy or a woman and her child, chosen\r\nbecause of some mark or bodily defect, which the gods had noted and\r\nby which the victims were to be recognised. With the human victims\r\nwere sent a cow, a goat, a fowl, and a dog; and a strong guard\r\nescorted them to the land which the god had indicated. There the\r\nlimbs of the victims were broken and they were left to die a\r\nlingering death in the enemy\'s country, being too crippled to crawl\r\nback to Uganda. The disease or plague was thought to have been thus\r\ntransferred to the victims and to have been conveyed back in their\r\npersons to the land from which it came.\r\n\r\nSome of the aboriginal tribes of China, as a protection against\r\npestilence, select a man of great muscular strength to act the part\r\nof scapegoat. Having besmeared his face with paint, he performs many\r\nantics with the view of enticing all pestilential and noxious\r\ninfluences to attach themselves to him only. He is assisted by a\r\npriest. Finally the scapegoat, hotly pursued by men and women\r\nbeating gongs and tom-toms, is driven with great haste out of the\r\ntown or village. In the Punjaub a cure for the murrain is to hire a\r\nman of the Chamar caste, turn his face away from the village, brand\r\nhim with a red-hot sickle, and let him go out into the jungle taking\r\nthe murrain with him. He must not look back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The Periodic Expulsion of Evils in a Material Vehicle\r\n\r\nTHE MEDIATE expulsion of evils by means of a scapegoat or other\r\nmaterial vehicle, like the immediate expulsion of them in invisible\r\nform, tends to become periodic, and for a like reason. Thus every\r\nyear, generally in March, the people of Leti, Moa, and Lakor,\r\nislands of the Indian Archipelago, send away all their diseases to\r\nsea. They make a proa about six feet long, rig it with sails, oars,\r\nrudder, and other gear, and every family deposits in its some rice,\r\nfruit, a fowl, two eggs, insects that ravage the fields, and so on.\r\nThen they let it drift away to sea, saying, "Take away from here all\r\nkinds of sickness, take them to other islands, to other lands,\r\ndistribute them in places that lie eastward, where the sun rises."\r\nThe Biajas of Borneo annually send to sea a little bark laden with\r\nthe sins and misfortunes of the people. The crew of any ship that\r\nfalls in with the ill-omened bark at sea will suffer all the sorrows\r\nwith which it is laden. A like custom is annually observed by the\r\nDusuns of the Tuaran district in British North Borneo. The ceremony\r\nis the most important of the whole year. Its aim is to bring good\r\nluck to the village during the ensuing year by solemnly expelling\r\nall the evil spirits that may have collected in or about the houses\r\nthroughout the last twelve months. The task of routing out the\r\ndemons and banishing them devolves chiefly on women. Dressed in\r\ntheir finest array, they go in procession through the village. One\r\nof them carries a small sucking pig in a basket on her back; and all\r\nof them bear wands, with which they belabour the little pig at the\r\nappropriate moment; its squeals help to attract the vagrant spirits.\r\nAt every house the women dance and sing, clashing castanets or\r\ncymbals of brass and jingling bunches of little brass bells in both\r\nhands. When the performance has been repeated at every house in the\r\nvillage, the procession defiles down to the river, and all the evil\r\nspirits, which the performers have chased from the houses, follow\r\nthem to the edge of the water. There a raft has been made ready and\r\nmoored to the bank. It contains offerings of food, cloth,\r\ncooking-pots, and swords; and the deck is crowded with figures of\r\nmen, women, animals, and birds, all made out of the leaves of the\r\nsago palm. The evil spirits now embark on the raft, and when they\r\nare all aboard, it is pushed off and allowed to float down with the\r\ncurrent, carrying the demons with it. Should the raft run aground\r\nnear the village, it is shoved off with all speed, lest the\r\ninvisible passengers should seize the opportunity of landing and\r\nreturning to the village. Finally, the sufferings of the little pig,\r\nwhose squeals served to decoy the demons from their lurking-places,\r\nare terminated by death, for it is killed and its carcase thrown\r\naway.\r\n\r\nEvery year, at the beginning of the dry season, the Nicobar\r\nIslanders carry the model of a ship through their villages. The\r\ndevils are chased out of the huts, and driven on board the little\r\nship, which is then launched and suffered to sail away with the\r\nwind. The ceremony has been described by a catechist, who witnessed\r\nit at Car Nicobar in July 1897. For three days the people were busy\r\npreparing two very large floating cars, shaped like canoes, fitted\r\nwith sails, and loaded with certain leaves, which possessed the\r\nvaluable property of expelling devils. While the young people were\r\nthus engaged, the exorcists and the elders sat in a house singing\r\nsongs by turns; but often they would come forth, pace the beach\r\narmed with rods, and forbid the devil to enter the village. The\r\nfourth day of the solemnity bore a name which means "Expelling the\r\nDevil by Sails." In the evening all the villagers assembled, the\r\nwomen bringing baskets of ashes and bunches of devil-expelling\r\nleaves. These leaves were then distributed to everybody, old and\r\nyoung. When all was ready, a band of robust men, attended by a guard\r\nof exorcists, carried one of the cars down to the sea on the right\r\nside of the village graveyard, and set it floating in the water. As\r\nsoon as they had returned, another band of men carried the other car\r\nto the beach and floated it similarly in the sea to the left of the\r\ngraveyard. The demon-laden barks being now launched, the women threw\r\nashes from the shore, and the whole crowd shouted, saying, "Fly\r\naway, devil, fly away, never come again!" The wind and the tide\r\nbeing favourable, the canoes sailed quickly away; and that night all\r\nthe people feasted together with great joy, because the devil had\r\ndeparted in the direction of Chowra. A similar expulsion of devils\r\ntakes place once a year in other Nicobar villages; but the\r\nceremonies are held at different times in different places.\r\n\r\nAmongst many of the aboriginal tribes of China, a great festival is\r\ncelebrated in the third month of every year. It is held by way of a\r\ngeneral rejoicing over what the people believe to be a total\r\nannihilation of the ills of the past twelve months. The destruction\r\nis supposed to be effected in the following way. A large earthenware\r\njar filled with gunpowder, stones, and bits of iron is buried in the\r\nearth. A train of gunpowder, communicating with the jar, is then\r\nlaid; and a match being applied, the jar and its contents are blown\r\nup. The stones and bits of iron represent the ills and disasters of\r\nthe past year, and the dispersion of them by the explosion is\r\nbelieved to remove the ills and disasters themselves. The festival\r\nis attended with much revelling and drunkenness.\r\n\r\nAt Old Calabar on the coast of Guinea, the devils and ghosts are, or\r\nused to be, publicly expelled once in two years. Among the spirits\r\nthus driven from their haunts are the souls of all the people who\r\ndied since the last lustration of the town. About three weeks or a\r\nmonth before the expulsion, which according to one account takes\r\nplace in the month of November, rude effigies representing men and\r\nanimals, such as crocodiles, leopards, elephants, bullocks, and\r\nbirds, are made of wicker-work or wood, and being hung with strips\r\nof cloth and bedizened with gew-gaws, are set before the door of\r\nevery house. About three o\'clock in the morning of the day appointed\r\nfor the ceremony the whole population turns out into the streets,\r\nand proceeds with a deafening uproar and in a state of the wildest\r\nexcitement to drive all lurking devils and ghosts into the effigies,\r\nin order that they may be banished with them from the abodes of men.\r\nFor this purpose bands of people roam through the streets knocking\r\non doors, firing guns, beating drums, blowing on horns, ringing\r\nbells, clattering pots and pans, shouting and hallooing with might\r\nand main, in short making all the noise it is possible for them to\r\nraise. The hubbub goes on till the approach of dawn, when it\r\ngradually subsides and ceases altogether at sunrise. By this time\r\nthe houses have been thoroughly swept, and all the frightened\r\nspirits are supposed to have huddled into the effigies or their\r\nfluttering drapery. In these wicker figures are also deposited the\r\nsweepings of the houses and the ashes of yesterday\'s fires. Then the\r\ndemon-laden images are hastily snatched up, carried in tumultuous\r\nprocession down to the brink of the river, and thrown into the water\r\nto the tuck of drums. The ebb-tide bears them away seaward, and thus\r\nthe town is swept clean of ghosts and devils for another two years.\r\n\r\nSimilar annual expulsions of embodied evils are not unknown in\r\nEurope. On the evening of Easter Sunday the gypsies of Southern\r\nEurope take a wooden vessel like a band-box, which rests cradle-wise\r\non two cross pieces of wood. In this they place herbs and simples,\r\ntogether with the dried carcase of a snake, or lizard, which every\r\nperson present must first have touched with his fingers. The vessel\r\nis then wrapt in white and red wool, carried by the oldest man from\r\ntent to tent, and finally thrown into running water, not, however,\r\nbefore every member of the band has spat into it once, and the\r\nsorceress has uttered some spells over it. They believe that by\r\nperforming this ceremony they dispel all the illnesses that would\r\notherwise have afflicted them in the course of the year; and that if\r\nany one finds the vessel and opens it out of curiosity, he and his\r\nwill be visited by all the maladies which the others have escaped.\r\n\r\nThe scapegoat by means of which the accumulated ills of a whole year\r\nare publicly expelled is sometimes an animal. For example, among the\r\nGaros of Assam, "besides the sacrifices for individual cases of\r\nillness, there are certain ceremonies which are observed once a year\r\nby a whole community or village, and are intended to safeguard its\r\nmembers from dangers of the forest, and from sickness and mishap\r\nduring the coming twelve months. The principal of these is the\r\nAsongtata ceremony. Close to the outskirts of every big village a\r\nnumber of stones may be noticed stuck into the ground, apparently\r\nwithout order or method. These are known by the name of _asong,_ and\r\non them is offered the sacrifice which the Asongtata demands. The\r\nsacrifice of a goat takes place, and a month later, that of a\r\n_langur_ (_Entellus_ monkey) or a bamboo-rat is considered\r\nnecessary. The animal chosen has a rope fastened round its neck and\r\nis led by two men, one on each side of it, to every house in the\r\nvillage. It is taken inside each house in turn, the assembled\r\nvillagers, meanwhile, beating the walls from the outside, to\r\nfrighten and drive out any evil spirits which may have taken up\r\ntheir residence within. The round of the village having been made in\r\nthis manner, the monkey or rat is led to the outskirts of the\r\nvillage, killed by a blow of a _dao,_ which disembowels it, and then\r\ncrucified on bamboos set up in the ground. Round the crucified\r\nanimal long, sharp bamboo stakes are placed, which form _chevaux de\r\nfrise_ round about it. These commemorate the days when such defences\r\nsurrounded the villages on all sides to keep off human enemies, and\r\nthey are now a symbol to ward off sickness and dangers to life from\r\nthe wild animals of the forest. The _langur_ required for the\r\npurpose is hunted down some days before, but should it be found\r\nimpossible to catch one, a brown monkey may take its place; a hulock\r\nmay not be used." Here the crucified ape or rat is the public\r\nscapegoat, which by its vicarious sufferings and death relieves the\r\npeople from all sickness and mishap in the coming year.\r\n\r\nAgain, on one day of the year the Bhotiyas of Juhar, in the Western\r\nHimalayas, take a dog, intoxicate him with spirits and bhang or\r\nhemp, and having fed him with sweetmeats, lead him round the village\r\nand let him loose. They then chase and kill him with sticks and\r\nstones, and believe that, when they have done so, no disease or\r\nmisfortune will visit the village during the year. In some parts of\r\nBreadalbane it was formerly the custom on New Year\'s Day to take a\r\ndog to the door, give him a bit of bread, and drive him out, saying,\r\n"Get away, you dog! Whatever death of men or loss of cattle would\r\nhappen in this house to the end of the present year, may it all\r\nlight on your head!" On the Day of Atonement, which was the tenth\r\nday of the seventh month, the Jewish high-priest laid both his hands\r\non the head of a live goat, confessed over it all the iniquities of\r\nthe Children of Israel, and, having thereby transferred the sins of\r\nthe people to the beast, sent it away into the wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe scapegoat upon whom the sins of the people are periodically\r\nlaid, may also be a human being. At Onitsha, on the Niger, two human\r\nbeings used to be annually sacrificed to take away the sins of the\r\nland. The victims were purchased by public subscription. All persons\r\nwho, during the past year, had fallen into gross sins, such as\r\nincendiarism, theft, adultery, witchcraft, and so forth, were\r\nexpected to contribute 28 _ngugas,_ or a little over \xa32. The money\r\nthus collected was taken into the interior of the country and\r\nexpended in the purchase of two sickly persons "to be offered as a\r\nsacrifice for all these abominable crimes--one for the land and one\r\nfor the river." A man from a neighbouring town was hired to put them\r\nto death. On the twenty-seventh of February 1858 the Rev. J. C.\r\nTaylor witnessed the sacrifice of one of these victims. The sufferer\r\nwas a woman, about nineteen or twenty years of age. They dragged her\r\nalive along the ground, face downwards, from the king\'s house to the\r\nriver, a distance of two miles, the crowds who accompanied her\r\ncrying, "Wickedness! wickedness!" The intention was "to take away\r\nthe iniquities of the land. The body was dragged along in a\r\nmerciless manner, as if the weight of all their wickedness was thus\r\ncarried away." Similar customs are said to be still secretly\r\npractised every year by many tribes in the delta of the Niger in\r\nspite of the vigilance of the British Government. Among the Yoruba\r\nnegroes of West Africa "the human victim chosen for sacrifice, and\r\nwho may be either a freeborn or a slave, a person of noble or\r\nwealthy parentage, or one of humble birth, is, after he has been\r\nchosen and marked out for the purpose, called an _Oluwo._ He is\r\nalways well fed and nourished and supplied with whatever he should\r\ndesire during the period of his confinement. When the occasion\r\narrives for him to be sacrificed and offered up, he is commonly led\r\nabout and paraded through the streets of the town or city of the\r\nSovereign who would sacrifice him for the well-being of his\r\ngovernment and of every family and individual under it, in order\r\nthat he might carry off the sin, guilt, misfortune and death of all\r\nwithout exception. Ashes and chalk would be employed to hide his\r\nidentity by the one being freely thrown over his head, and his face\r\npainted with the latter, whilst individuals would often rush out of\r\ntheir houses to lay their hands upon him that they might thus\r\ntransfer to him their sin, guilt, trouble, and death." This parade\r\nover, he is taken to an inner sanctuary and beheaded. His last words\r\nor dying groans are the signal for an outburst of joy among the\r\npeople assembled outside, who believe that the sacrifice has been\r\naccepted and the divine wrath appeased.\r\n\r\nIn Siam it used to be the custom on one day of the year to single\r\nout a woman broken down by debauchery, and carry her on a litter\r\nthrough all the streets to the music of drums and hautboys. The mob\r\ninsulted her and pelted her with dirt; and after having carried her\r\nthrough the whole city, they threw her on a dunghill or a hedge of\r\nthorns outside the ramparts, forbidding her ever to enter the walls\r\nagain. They believed that the woman thus drew upon herself all the\r\nmalign influences of the air and of evil spirits. The Bataks of\r\nSumatra offer either a red horse or a buffalo as a public sacrifice\r\nto purify the land and obtain the favour of the gods. Formerly, it\r\nis said, a man was bound to the same stake as the buffalo, and when\r\nthey killed the animal, the man was driven away; no one might\r\nreceive him, converse with him, or give him food. Doubtless he was\r\nsupposed to carry away the sins and misfortunes of the people.\r\n\r\nSometimes the scapegoat is a divine animal. The people of Malabar\r\nshare the Hindoo reverence for the cow, to kill and eat which "they\r\nesteem to be a crime as heinous as homicide or wilful murder."\r\nNevertheless the "Bramans transfer the sins of the people into one\r\nor more Cows, which are then carry\'d away, both the Cows and the\r\nSins wherewith these Beasts are charged, to what place the Braman\r\nshall appoint." When the ancient Egyptians sacrificed a bull, they\r\ninvoked upon its head all the evils that might otherwise befall\r\nthemselves and the land of Egypt, and thereupon they either sold the\r\nbull\'s head to the Greeks or cast it into the river. Now, it cannot\r\nbe said that in the times known to us the Egyptians worshipped bulls\r\nin general, for they seem to have commonly killed and eaten them.\r\nBut a good many circumstances point to the conclusion that\r\noriginally all cattle, bulls as well as cows, were held sacred by\r\nthe Egyptians. For not only were all cows esteemed holy by them and\r\nnever sacrificed, but even bulls might not be sacrificed unless they\r\nhad certain natural marks; a priest examined every bull before it\r\nwas sacrificed; if it had the proper marks, he put his seal on the\r\nanimal in token that it might be sacrificed; and if a man sacrificed\r\na bull which had not been sealed, he was put to death. Moreover, the\r\nworship of the black bulls Apis and Mnevis, especially the former,\r\nplayed an important part in Egyptian religion; all bulls that died a\r\nnatural death were carefully buried in the suburbs of the cities,\r\nand their bones were afterwards collected from all parts of Egypt\r\nand interred in a single spot; and at the sacrifice of a bull in the\r\ngreat rites of Isis all the worshippers beat their breasts and\r\nmourned. On the whole, then, we are perhaps entitled to infer that\r\nbulls were originally, as cows were always, esteemed sacred by the\r\nEgyptians, and that the slain bull upon whose head they laid the\r\nmisfortunes of the people was once a divine scapegoat. It seems not\r\nimprobable that the lamb annually slain by the Madis of Central\r\nAfrica is a divine scapegoat, and the same supposition may partly\r\nexplain the Zuni sacrifice of the turtle.\r\n\r\nLastly, the scapegoat may be a divine man. Thus, in November the\r\nGonds of India worship Ghansyam Deo, the protector of the crops, and\r\nat the festival the god himself is said to descend on the head of\r\none of the worshippers, who is suddenly seized with a kind of fit\r\nand, after staggering about, rushes off into the jungle, where it is\r\nbelieved that, if left to himself, he would die mad. However, they\r\nbring him back, but he does not recover his senses for one or two\r\ndays. The people think that one man is thus singled out as a\r\nscapegoat for the sins of the rest of the village. In the temple of\r\nthe Moon the Albanians of the Eastern Caucasus kept a number of\r\nsacred slaves, of whom many were inspired and prophesied. When one\r\nof these men exhibited more than usual symptoms of inspiration or\r\ninsanity, and wandered solitary up and down the woods, like the Gond\r\nin the jungle, the high priest had him bound with a sacred chain and\r\nmaintained him in luxury for a year. At the end of the year he was\r\nanointed with unguents and led forth to be sacrificed. A man whose\r\nbusiness it was to slay these human victims and to whom practice had\r\ngiven dexterity, advanced from the crowd and thrust a sacred spear\r\ninto the victim\'s side, piercing his heart. From the manner in which\r\nthe slain man fell, omens were drawn as to the welfare of the\r\ncommonwealth. Then the body was carried to a certain spot where all\r\nthe people stood upon it as a purificatory ceremony. This last\r\ncircumstance clearly indicates that the sins of the people were\r\ntransferred to the victim, just as the Jewish priest transferred the\r\nsins of the people to the scapegoat by laying his hands on the\r\nanimal\'s head; and since the man was believed to be possessed by the\r\ndivine spirit, we have here an undoubted example of a man-god slain\r\nto take away the sins and misfortunes of the people.\r\n\r\nIn Tibet the ceremony of the scapegoat presents some remarkable\r\nfeatures. The Tibetan new year begins with the new moon which\r\nappears about the fifteenth of February. For twenty-three days\r\nafterwards the government of Lhasa, the capital, is taken out of the\r\nhands of the ordinary rulers and entrusted to the monk of the Debang\r\nmonastery who offers to pay the highest sum for the privilege. The\r\nsuccessful bidder is called the Jalno, and he announces his\r\naccession to power in person, going through the streets of Lhasa\r\nwith a silver stick in his hand. Monks from all the neighbouring\r\nmonasteries and temples assemble to pay him homage. The Jalno\r\nexercises his authority in the most arbitrary manner for his own\r\nbenefit, as all the fines which he exacts are his by purchase. The\r\nprofit he makes is about ten times the amount of the purchase money.\r\nHis men go about the streets in order to discover any conduct on the\r\npart of the inhabitants that can be found fault with. Every house in\r\nLhasa is taxed at this time, and the slightest offence is punished\r\nwith unsparing rigour by fines. This severity of the Jalno drives\r\nall working classes out of the city till the twenty-three days are\r\nover. But if the laity go out, the clergy come in. All the Buddhist\r\nmonasteries of the country for miles round about open their gates\r\nand disgorge their inmates. All the roads that lead down into Lhasa\r\nfrom the neighbouring mountains are full of monks hurrying to the\r\ncapital, some on foot, some on horseback, some riding asses or\r\nlowing oxen, all carrying their prayer-books and culinary utensils.\r\nIn such multitudes do they come that the streets and squares of the\r\ncity are encumbered with their swarms, and incarnadined with their\r\nred cloaks. The disorder and confusion are indescribable. Bands of\r\nthe holy men traverse the streets chanting prayers, or uttering wild\r\ncries. They meet, they jostle, they quarrel, they fight; bloody\r\nnoses, black eyes, and broken heads are freely given and received.\r\nAll day long, too, from before the peep of dawn till after darkness\r\nhas fallen, these red-cloaked monks hold services in the dim\r\nincense-laden air of the great Machindranath temple, the cathedral\r\nof Lhasa; and thither they crowd thrice a day to receive their doles\r\nof tea and soup and money. The cathedral is a vast building,\r\nstanding in the centre of the city, and surrounded by bazaars and\r\nshops. The idols in it are richly inlaid with gold and precious\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four days after the Jalno has ceased to have authority, he\r\nassumes it again, and for ten days acts in the same arbitrary manner\r\nas before. On the first of the ten days the priests again assemble\r\nat the cathedral, pray to the gods to prevent sickness and other\r\nevils among the people, "and, as a peace-offering, sacrifice one\r\nman. The man is not killed purposely, but the ceremony he undergoes\r\noften proves fatal. Grain is thrown against his head, and his face\r\nis painted half white, half black." Thus grotesquely disguised, and\r\ncarrying a coat of skin on his arm, he is called the King of the\r\nYears, and sits daily in the market-place, where he helps himself to\r\nwhatever he likes and goes about shaking a black yak\'s tail over the\r\npeople, who thus transfer their bad luck to him. On the tenth day,\r\nall the troops in Lhasa march to the great temple and form in line\r\nbefore it. The King of the Years is brought forth from the temple\r\nand receives small donations from the assembled multitude. He then\r\nridicules the Jalno, saying to him, "What we perceive through the\r\nfive senses is no illusion. All you teach is untrue," and the like.\r\nThe Jalno, who represents the Grand Lama for the time being,\r\ncontests these heretical opinions; the dispute waxes warm, and at\r\nlast both agree to decide the questions at issue by a cast of the\r\ndice, the Jalno offering to change places with the scapegoat should\r\nthe throw be against him. If the King of the Years wins, much evil\r\nis prognosticated; but if the Jalno wins, there is great rejoicing,\r\nfor it proves that his adversary has been accepted by the gods as a\r\nvictim to bear all the sins of the people of Lhasa. Fortune,\r\nhowever, always favours the Jalno, who throws sixes with unvarying\r\nsuccess, while his opponent turns up only ones. Nor is this so\r\nextraordinary as at first sight it might appear; for the Jalno\'s\r\ndice are marked with nothing but sixes and his adversary\'s with\r\nnothing but ones. When he sees the finger of Providence thus plainly\r\npointed against him, the King of the Years is terrified and flees\r\naway upon a white horse, with a white dog, a white bird, salt, and\r\nso forth, which have all been provided for him by the government.\r\nHis face is still painted half white and half black, and he still\r\nwears his leathern coat. The whole populace pursues him, hooting,\r\nyelling, and firing blank shots in volleys after him. Thus driven\r\nout of the city, he is detained for seven days in the great chamber\r\nof horrors at the Samyas monastery, surrounded by monstrous and\r\nterrific images of devils and skins of huge serpents and wild\r\nbeasts. Thence he goes away into the mountains of Chetang, where he\r\nhas to remain an outcast for several months or a year in a narrow\r\nden. If he dies before the time is out, the people say it is an\r\nauspicious omen; but if he survives, he may return to Lhasa and play\r\nthe part of scapegoat over again the following year.\r\n\r\nThis quaint ceremonial, still annually observed in the secluded\r\ncapital of Buddhism--the Rome of Asia--is interesting because it\r\nexhibits, in a clearly marked religious stratification, a series of\r\ndivine redeemers themselves redeemed, of vicarious sacrifices\r\nvicariously atoned for, of gods undergoing a process of\r\nfossilisation, who, while they retain the privileges, have\r\ndisburdened themselves of the pains and penalties of divinity. In\r\nthe Jalno we may without undue straining discern a successor of\r\nthose temporary kings, those mortal gods, who purchase a short lease\r\nof power and glory at the price of their lives. That he is the\r\ntemporary substitute of the Grand Lama is certain; that he is, or\r\nwas once, liable to act as scapegoat for the people is made nearly\r\ncertain by his offer to change places with the real scapegoat--the\r\nKing of the Years--if the arbitrament of the dice should go against\r\nhim. It is true that the conditions under which the question is now\r\nput to the hazard have reduced the offer to an idle form. But such\r\nforms are no mere mushroom growths, springing up of themselves in a\r\nnight. If they are now lifeless formalities, empty husks devoid of\r\nsignificance, we may be sure that they once had a life and a\r\nmeaning; if at the present day they are blind alleys leading\r\nnowhere, we may be certain that in former days they were paths that\r\nled somewhere, if only to death. That death was the goal to which of\r\nold the Tibetan scapegoat passed after his brief period of licence\r\nin the market-place, is a conjecture that has much to commend it.\r\nAnalogy suggests it; the blank shots fired after him, the statement\r\nthat the ceremony often proves fatal, the belief that his death is a\r\nhappy omen, all confirm it. We need not wonder then that the Jalno,\r\nafter paying so dear to act as deputy-deity for a few weeks, should\r\nhave preferred to die by deputy rather than in his own person when\r\nhis time was up. The painful but necessary duty was accordingly laid\r\non some poor devil, some social outcast, some wretch with whom the\r\nworld had gone hard, who readily agreed to throw away his life at\r\nthe end of a few days if only he might have his fling in the\r\nmeantime. For observe that while the time allowed to the original\r\ndeputy--the Jalno--was measured by weeks, the time allowed to the\r\ndeputy\'s deputy was cut down to days, ten days according to one\r\nauthority, seven days according to another. So short a rope was\r\ndoubtless thought a long enough tether for so black or sickly a\r\nsheep; so few sands in the hour-glass, slipping so fast away,\r\nsufficed for one who had wasted so many precious years. Hence in the\r\njack-pudding who now masquerades with motley countenance in the\r\nmarket-place of Lhasa, sweeping up misfortune with a black yak\'s\r\ntail, we may fairly see the substitute of a substitute, the vicar of\r\na vicar, the proxy on whose back the heavy burden was laid when it\r\nhad been lifted from nobler shoulders. But the clue, if we have\r\nfollowed it aright, does not stop at the Jalno; it leads straight\r\nback to the pope of Lhasa himself, the Grand Lama, of whom the Jalno\r\nis merely the temporary vicar. The analogy of many customs in many\r\nlands points to the conclusion that, if this human divinity stoops\r\nto resign his ghostly power for a time into the hands of a\r\nsubstitute, it is, or rather was once, for no other reason than that\r\nthe substitute might die in his stead. Thus through the mist of ages\r\nunillumined by the lamp of history, the tragic figure of the pope of\r\nBuddhism--God\'s vicar on earth for Asia--looms dim and sad as the\r\nman-god who bore his people\'s sorrows, the Good Shepherd who laid\r\ndown his life for the sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. On Scapegoats in General\r\n\r\nTHE FOREGOING survey of the custom of publicly expelling the\r\naccumulated evils of a village or town or country suggests a few\r\ngeneral observations.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it will not be disputed that what I have called\r\nthe immediate and the mediate expulsions of evil are identical in\r\nintention; in other words, that whether the evils are conceived of\r\nas invisible or as embodied in a material form, is a circumstance\r\nentirely subordinate to the main object of the ceremony, which is\r\nsimply to effect a total clearance of all the ills that have been\r\ninfesting a people. If any link were wanting to connect the two\r\nkinds of expulsion, it would be furnished by such a practice as that\r\nof sending the evils away in a litter or a boat. For here, on the\r\none hand, the evils are invisible and intangible; and, on the other\r\nhand, there is a visible and tangible vehicle to convey them away.\r\nAnd a scapegoat is nothing more than such a vehicle.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, when a general clearance of evils is resorted\r\nto periodically, the interval between the celebrations of the\r\nceremony is commonly a year, and the time of year when the ceremony\r\ntakes place usually coincides with some well-marked change of\r\nseason, such as the beginning or end of winter in the arctic and\r\ntemperate zones, and the beginning or end of the rainy season in the\r\ntropics. The increased mortality which such climatic changes are apt\r\nto produce, especially amongst ill-fed, ill-clothed, and ill-housed\r\nsavages, is set down by primitive man to the agency of demons, who\r\nmust accordingly be expelled. Hence, in the tropical regions of New\r\nBritain and Peru, the devils are or were driven out at the beginning\r\nof the rainy season; hence, on the dreary coasts of Baffin Land,\r\nthey are banished at the approach of the bitter Arctic winter. When\r\na tribe has taken to husbandry, the time for the general expulsion\r\nof devils is naturally made to agree with one of the great epochs of\r\nthe agricultural year, as sowing, or harvest; but, as these epochs\r\nthemselves naturally coincide with changes of season, it does not\r\nfollow that the transition from the hunting or pastoral to the\r\nagricultural life involves any alteration in the time of celebrating\r\nthis great annual rite. Some of the agricultural communities of\r\nIndia and the Hindoo Koosh, as we have seen, hold their general\r\nclearance of demons at harvest, others at sowing-time. But, at\r\nwhatever season of the year it is held, the general expulsion of\r\ndevils commonly marks the beginning of the new year. For, before\r\nentering on a new year, people are anxious to rid themselves of the\r\ntroubles that have harassed them in the past; hence it comes about\r\nthat in so many communities the beginning of the new year is\r\ninaugurated with a solemn and public banishment of evil spirits.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, it is to be observed that this public and\r\nperiodic expulsion of devils is commonly preceded or followed by a\r\nperiod of general license, during which the ordinary restraints of\r\nsociety are thrown aside, and all offences, short of the gravest,\r\nare allowed to pass unpunished. In Guinea and Tonquin the period of\r\nlicense precedes the public expulsion of demons; and the suspension\r\nof the ordinary government in Lhasa previous to the expulsion of the\r\nscapegoat is perhaps a relic of a similar period of universal\r\nlicense. Amongst the Hos of India the period of license follows the\r\nexpulsion of the devil. Amongst the Iroquois it hardly appears\r\nwhether it preceded or followed the banishment of evils. In any\r\ncase, the extraordinary relaxation of all ordinary rules of conduct\r\non such occasions is doubtless to be explained by the general\r\nclearance of evils which precedes or follows it. On the one hand,\r\nwhen a general riddance of evil and absolution from all sin is in\r\nimmediate prospect, men are encouraged to give the rein to their\r\npassions, trusting that the coming ceremony will wipe out the score\r\nwhich they are running up so fast. On the other hand, when the\r\nceremony has just taken place, men\'s minds are freed from the\r\noppressive sense, under which they generally labour, of an\r\natmosphere surcharged with devils; and in the first revulsion of joy\r\nthey overleap the limits commonly imposed by custom and morality.\r\nWhen the ceremony takes place at harvest-time, the elation of\r\nfeeling which it excites is further stimulated by the state of\r\nphysical wellbeing produced by an abundant supply of food.\r\n\r\nFourthly, the employment of a divine man or animal as a scapegoat is\r\nespecially to be noted; indeed, we are here directly concerned with\r\nthe custom of banishing evils only in so far as these evils are\r\nbelieved to be transferred to a god who is afterwards slain. It may\r\nbe suspected that the custom of employing a divine man or animal as\r\na public scapegoat is much more widely diffused than appears from\r\nthe examples cited. For, as has already been pointed out, the custom\r\nof killing a god dates from so early a period of human history that\r\nin later ages, even when the custom continues to be practised, it is\r\nliable to be misinterpreted. The divine character of the animal or\r\nman is forgotten, and he comes to be regarded merely as an ordinary\r\nvictim. This is especially likely to be the case when it is a divine\r\nman who is killed. For when a nation becomes civilised, if it does\r\nnot drop human sacrifices altogether, it at least selects as victims\r\nonly such wretches as would be put to death at any rate. Thus the\r\nkilling of a god may sometimes come to be confounded with the\r\nexecution of a criminal.\r\n\r\nIf we ask why a dying god should be chosen to take upon himself and\r\ncarry away the sins and sorrows of the people, it may be suggested\r\nthat in the practice of using the divinity as a scapegoat we have a\r\ncombination of two customs which were at one time distinct and\r\nindependent. On the one hand we have seen that it has been customary\r\nto kill the human or animal god in order to save his divine life\r\nfrom being weakened by the inroads of age. On the other hand we have\r\nseen that it has been customary to have a general expulsion of evils\r\nand sins once a year. Now, if it occurred to people to combine these\r\ntwo customs, the result would be the employment of the dying god as\r\na scapegoat. He was killed, not originally to take away sin, but to\r\nsave the divine life from the degeneracy of old age; but, since he\r\nhad to be killed at any rate, people may have thought that they\r\nmight as well seize the opportunity to lay upon him the burden of\r\ntheir sufferings and sins, in order that he might bear it away with\r\nhim to the unknown world beyond the grave.\r\n\r\nThe use of the divinity as a scapegoat clears up the ambiguity\r\nwhich, as we saw, appears to hang about the European folk-custom of\r\n"carrying out Death." Grounds have been shown for believing that in\r\nthis ceremony the so-called Death was originally the spirit of\r\nvegetation, who was annually slain in spring, in order that he might\r\ncome to life again with all the vigour of youth. But, as I pointed\r\nout, there are certain features in the ceremony which are not\r\nexplicable on this hypothesis alone. Such are the marks of joy with\r\nwhich the effigy of Death is carried out to be buried or burnt, and\r\nthe fear and abhorrence of it manifested by the bearers. But these\r\nfeatures become at once intelligible if we suppose that the Death\r\nwas not merely the dying god of vegetation, but also a public\r\nscapegoat, upon whom were laid all the evils that had afflicted the\r\npeople during the past year. Joy on such an occasion is natural and\r\nappropriate; and if the dying god appears to be the object of that\r\nfear and abhorrence which are properly due not to himself, but to\r\nthe sins and misfortunes with which he is laden, this arises merely\r\nfrom the difficulty of distinguishing, or at least of marking the\r\ndistinction, between the bearer and the burden. When the burden is\r\nof a baleful character, the bearer of it will be feared and shunned\r\njust as much as if he were himself instinct with those dangerous\r\nproperties of which, as it happens, he is only the vehicle.\r\nSimilarly we have seen that disease-laden and sin-laden boats are\r\ndreaded and shunned by East Indian peoples. Again, the view that in\r\nthese popular customs the Death is a scapegoat as well as a\r\nrepresentative of the divine spirit of vegetation derives some\r\nsupport from the circumstance that its expulsion is always\r\ncelebrated in spring and chiefly by Slavonic peoples. For the\r\nSlavonic year began in spring; and thus, in one of its aspects, the\r\nceremony of "carrying out Death" would be an example of the\r\nwidespread custom of expelling the accumulated evils of the old year\r\nbefore entering on a new one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVIII. Human Scapegoats in Classical Antiquity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Human Scapegoat in Ancient Rome\r\n\r\nWE are now prepared to notice the use of the human scapegoat in\r\nclassical antiquity. Every year on the fourteenth of March a man\r\nclad in skins was led in procession through the streets of Rome,\r\nbeaten with long white rods, and driven out of the city. He was\r\ncalled Mamurius Veturius, that is, "the old Mars," and as the\r\nceremony took place on the day preceding the first full moon of the\r\nold Roman year (which began on the first of March), the skin-clad\r\nman must have represented the Mars of the past year, who was driven\r\nout at the beginning of a new one. Now Mars was originally not a god\r\nof war but of vegetation. For it was to Mars that the Roman\r\nhusbandman prayed for the prosperity of his corn and his vines, his\r\nfruit-trees and his copses; it was to Mars that the priestly college\r\nof the Arval Brothers, whose business it was to sacrifice for the\r\ngrowth of the crops, addressed their petitions almost exclusively;\r\nand it was to Mars, as we saw, that a horse was sacrificed in\r\nOctober to secure an abundant harvest. Moreover, it was to Mars,\r\nunder his title of "Mars of the woods" (_Mars Silvanus_), that\r\nfarmers offered sacrifice for the welfare of their cattle. We have\r\nalready seen that cattle are commonly supposed to be under the\r\nspecial patronage of tree-gods. Once more, the consecration of the\r\nvernal month of March to Mars seems to point him out as the deity of\r\nthe sprouting vegetation. Thus the Roman custom of expelling the old\r\nMars at the beginning of the new year in spring is identical with\r\nthe Slavonic custom of "carrying out Death," if the view here taken\r\nof the latter custom is correct. The similarity of the Roman and\r\nSlavonic customs has been already remarked by scholars, who appear,\r\nhowever, to have taken Mamurius Veturius and the corresponding\r\nfigures in the Slavonic ceremonies to be representatives of the old\r\nyear rather than of the old god of vegetation. It is possible that\r\nceremonies of this kind may have come to be thus interpreted in\r\nlater times even by the people who practised them. But the\r\npersonification of a period of time is too abstract an idea to be\r\nprimitive. However, in the Roman, as in the Slavonic, ceremony, the\r\nrepresentative of the god appears to have been treated not only as a\r\ndeity of vegetation but also as a scapegoat. His expulsion implies\r\nthis; for there is no reason why the god of vegetation, as such,\r\nshould be expelled the city. But it is otherwise if he is also a\r\nscapegoat; it then becomes necessary to drive him beyond the\r\nboundaries, that he may carry his sorrowful burden away to other\r\nlands. And, in fact, Mamurius Veturius appears to have been driven\r\naway to the land of the Oscans, the enemies of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Human Scapegoat in Ancient Greece\r\n\r\nTHE ANCIENT Greeks were also familiar with the use of a human\r\nscapegoat. In Plutarch\'s native town of Chaeronea a ceremony of this\r\nkind was performed by the chief magistrate at the Town Hall, and by\r\neach householder at his own home. It was called the "expulsion of\r\nhunger." A slave was beaten with rods of the _agnus castus,_ and\r\nturned out of doors with the words, "Out with hunger, and in with\r\nwealth and health." When Plutarch held the office of chief\r\nmagistrate of his native town he performed this ceremony at the Town\r\nHall, and he has recorded the discussion to which the custom\r\nafterwards gave rise.\r\n\r\nBut in civilised Greece the custom of the scapegoat took darker\r\nforms than the innocent rite over which the amiable and pious\r\nPlutarch presided. Whenever Marseilles, one of the busiest and most\r\nbrilliant of Greek colonies, was ravaged by a plague, a man of the\r\npoorer classes used to offer himself as a scapegoat. For a whole\r\nyear he was maintained at the public expense, being fed on choice\r\nand pure food. At the expiry of the year he was dressed in sacred\r\ngarments, decked with holy branches, and led through the whole city,\r\nwhile prayers were uttered that all the evils of the people might\r\nfall on his head. He was then cast out of the city or stoned to\r\ndeath by the people outside of the walls. The Athenians regularly\r\nmaintained a number of degraded and useless beings at the public\r\nexpense; and when any calamity, such as plague, drought, or famine,\r\nbefell the city, they sacrificed two of these outcast scapegoats.\r\nOne of the victims was sacrificed for the men and the other for the\r\nwomen. The former wore round his neck a string of black, the latter\r\na string of white figs. Sometimes, it seems, the victim slain on\r\nbehalf of the women was a woman. They were led about the city and\r\nthen sacrificed, apparently by being stoned to death outside the\r\ncity. But such sacrifices were not confined to extraordinary\r\noccasions of public calamity; it appears that every year, at the\r\nfestival of the Thargelia in May, two victims, one for the men and\r\none for the women, were led out of Athens and stoned to death. The\r\ncity of Abdera in Thrace was publicly purified once a year, and one\r\nof the burghers, set apart for the purpose, was stoned to death as a\r\nscapegoat or vicarious sacrifice for the life of all the others; six\r\ndays before his execution he was excommunicated, "in order that he\r\nalone might bear the sins of all the people."\r\n\r\nFrom the Lover\'s Leap, a white bluff at the southern end of their\r\nisland, the Leucadians used annually to hurl a criminal into the sea\r\nas a scapegoat. But to lighten his fall they fastened live birds and\r\nfeathers to him, and a flotilla of small boats waited below to catch\r\nhim and convey him beyond the boundary. Probably these humane\r\nprecautions were a mitigation of an earlier custom of flinging the\r\nscapegoat into the sea to drown. The Leucadian ceremony took place\r\nat the time of a sacrifice to Apollo, who had a temple or sanctuary\r\non the spot. Elsewhere it was customary to cast a young man every\r\nyear into the sea, with the prayer, "Be thou our offscouring." This\r\nceremony was supposed to rid the people of the evils by which they\r\nwere beset, or according to a somewhat different interpretation it\r\nredeemed them by paying the debt they owed to the sea-god. As\r\npractised by the Greeks of Asia Minor in the sixth century before\r\nour era, the custom of the scapegoat was as follows. When a city\r\nsuffered from plague, famine, or other public calamity, an ugly or\r\ndeformed person was chosen to take upon himself all the evils which\r\nafflicted the community. He was brought to a suitable place, where\r\ndried figs, a barley loaf, and cheese were put into his hand. These\r\nhe ate. Then he was beaten seven times upon his genital organs with\r\nsquills and branches of the wild fig and other wild trees, while the\r\nflutes played a particular tune. Afterwards he was burned on a pyre\r\nbuilt of the wood of forest trees; and his ashes were cast into the\r\nsea. A similar custom appears to have been annually celebrated by\r\nthe Asiatic Greeks at the harvest festival of the Thargelia.\r\n\r\nIn the ritual just described the scourging of the victim with\r\nsquills, branches of the wild fig, and so forth, cannot have been\r\nintended to aggravate his sufferings, otherwise any stick would have\r\nbeen good enough to beat him with. The true meaning of this part of\r\nthe ceremony has been explained by W. Mannhardt. He points out that\r\nthe ancients attributed to squills a magical power of averting evil\r\ninfluences, and that accordingly they hung them up at the doors of\r\ntheir houses and made use of them in purificatory rites. Hence the\r\nArcadian custom of whipping the image of Pan with squills at a\r\nfestival, or whenever the hunters returned empty-handed, must have\r\nbeen meant, not to punish the god, but to purify him from the\r\nharmful influences which were impeding him in the exercise of his\r\ndivine functions as a god who should supply the hunter with game.\r\nSimilarly the object of beating the human scapegoat on the genital\r\norgans with squills and so on, must have been to release his\r\nreproductive energies from any restraint or spell under which they\r\nmight be laid by demoniacal or other malignant agency; and as the\r\nThargelia at which he was annually sacrificed was an early harvest\r\nfestival celebrated in May, we must recognise in him a\r\nrepresentative of the creative and fertilising god of vegetation.\r\nThe representative of the god was annually slain for the purpose I\r\nhave indicated, that of maintaining the divine life in perpetual\r\nvigour, untainted by the weakness of age; and before he was put to\r\ndeath it was not unnatural to stimulate his reproductive powers in\r\norder that these might be transmitted in full activity to his\r\nsuccessor, the new god or new embodiment of the old god, who was\r\ndoubtless supposed immediately to take the place of the one slain.\r\nSimilar reasoning would lead to a similar treatment of the scapegoat\r\non special occasions, such as drought or famine. If the crops did\r\nnot answer to the expectation of the husbandman, this would be\r\nattributed to some failure in the generative powers of the god whose\r\nfunction it was to produce the fruits of the earth. It might be\r\nthought that he was under a spell or was growing old and feeble.\r\nAccordingly he was slain in the person of his representative, with\r\nall the ceremonies already described, in order that, born young\r\nagain, he might infuse his own youthful vigour into the stagnant\r\nenergies of nature. On the same principle we can understand why\r\nMamurius Veturius was beaten with rods, why the slave at the\r\nChaeronean ceremony was beaten with the _agnus castus_ (a tree to\r\nwhich magical properties were ascribed), why the effigy of Death in\r\nsome parts of Europe is assailed with sticks and stones, and why at\r\nBabylon the criminal who played the god scourged before he was\r\ncrucified. The purpose of the scourging was not to intensify the\r\nagony of the divine sufferer, but on the contrary to dispel any\r\nmalignant influences by which at the supreme moment he might\r\nconceivably be beset.\r\n\r\nThus far I have assumed that the human victims at the Thargelia\r\nrepresented the spirits of vegetation in general, but it has been\r\nwell remarked by Mr. W. R. Paton that these poor wretches seem to\r\nhave masqueraded as the spirits of fig-trees in particular. He\r\npoints out that the process of caprification, as it is called, that\r\nis, the artificial fertilisation of the cultivated fig-trees by\r\nhanging strings of wild figs among the boughs, takes place in Greece\r\nand Asia Minor in June about a month after the date of the\r\nThargelia, and he suggests that the hanging of the black and white\r\nfigs round the necks of the two human victims, one of whom\r\nrepresented the men and the other the women, may have been a direct\r\nimitation of the process of caprification designed, on the principle\r\nof imitative magic, to assist the fertilisation of the fig-trees.\r\nAnd since caprification is in fact a marriage of the male fig-tree\r\nwith the female fig-tree, Mr. Paton further supposes that the loves\r\nof the trees may, on the same principle of imitative magic, have\r\nbeen simulated by a mock or even a real marriage between the two\r\nhuman victims, one of whom appears sometimes to have been a woman.\r\nOn this view the practice of beating the human victims on their\r\ngenitals with branches of wild fig-trees and with squills was a\r\ncharm intended to stimulate the generative powers of the man and\r\nwoman who for the time being personated the male and the female\r\nfig-trees respectively, and who by their union in marriage, whether\r\nreal or pretended, were believed to help the trees to bear fruit.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation which I have adopted of the custom of beating the\r\nhuman scapegoat with certain plants is supported by many analogies.\r\nThus among the Kai of German New Guinea, when a man wishes to make\r\nhis banana shoots bear fruit quickly, he beats them with a stick cut\r\nfrom a banana-tree which has already borne fruit. Here it is obvious\r\nthat fruitfulness is believed to inhere in a stick cut from a\r\nfruitful tree and to be imparted by contact to the young banana\r\nplants. Similarly in New Caledonia a man will beat his taro plants\r\nlightly with a branch, saying as he does so, "I beat this taro that\r\nit may grow," after which he plants the branch in the ground at the\r\nend of the field. Among the Indians of Brazil at the mouth of the\r\nAmazon, when a man wishes to increase the size of his generative\r\norgan, he strikes it with the fruit of a white aquatic plant called\r\n_aninga,_ which grows luxuriantly on the banks of the river. The\r\nfruit, which is inedible, resembles a banana, and is clearly chosen\r\nfor this purpose on account of its shape. The ceremony should be\r\nperformed three days before or after the new moon. In the county of\r\nBekes, in Hungary, barren women are fertilised by being struck with\r\na stick which has first been used to separate pairing dogs. Here a\r\nfertilising virtue is clearly supposed to be inherent in the stick\r\nand to be conveyed by contact to the women. The Toradjas of Central\r\nCelebes think that the plant _Dracaena terminalis_ has a strong\r\nsoul, because when it is lopped, it soon grows up again. Hence when\r\na man is ill, his friends will sometimes beat him on the crown of\r\nthe head with _Dracaena_ leaves in order to strengthen his weak soul\r\nwith the strong soul of the plant.\r\n\r\nThese analogies, accordingly, support the interpretation which,\r\nfollowing my predecessors W. Mannhardt and Mr. W. R. Paton, I have\r\ngiven of the beating inflicted on the human victims at the Greek\r\nharvest festival of the Thargelia. That beating, being administered\r\nto the generative organs of the victims by fresh green plants and\r\nbranches, is most naturally explained as a charm to increase the\r\nreproductive energies of the men or women either by communicating to\r\nthem the fruitfulness of the plants and branches, or by ridding them\r\nof the maleficent influences; and this interpretation is confirmed\r\nby the observation that the two victims represented the two sexes,\r\none of them standing for the men in general and the other for the\r\nwomen. The season of the year when the ceremony was performed,\r\nnamely the time of the corn harvest, tallies well with the theory\r\nthat the rite had an agricultural significance. Further, that it was\r\nabove all intended to fertilise the fig-trees is strongly suggested\r\nby the strings of black and white figs which were hung round the\r\nnecks of the victims, as well as by the blows which were given their\r\ngenital organs with the branches of a wild fig-tree; since this\r\nprocedure closely resembles the procedure which ancient and modern\r\nhusbandmen in Greek lands have regularly resorted to for the purpose\r\nof actually fertilising their fig-trees. When we remember what an\r\nimportant part the artificial fertilisation of the date palm-tree\r\nappears to have played of old not only in the husbandry but in the\r\nreligion of Mesopotamia, there seems no reason to doubt that the\r\nartificial fertilisation of the fig-tree may in like manner have\r\nvindicated for itself a place in the solemn ritual of Greek\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nIf these considerations are just, we must apparently conclude that\r\nwhile the human victims at the Thargelia certainly appear in later\r\nclassical times to have figured chiefly as public scapegoats, who\r\ncarried away with them the sins, misfortunes, and sorrows of the\r\nwhole people, at an earlier time they may have been looked on as\r\nembodiments of vegetation, perhaps of the corn but particularly of\r\nthe fig-trees; and that the beating which they received and the\r\ndeath which they died were intended primarily to brace and refresh\r\nthe powers of vegetation then beginning to droop and languish under\r\nthe torrid heat of the Greek summer.\r\n\r\nThe view here taken of the Greek scapegoat, if it is correct,\r\nobviates an objection which might otherwise be brought against the\r\nmain argument of this book. To the theory that the priest of Aricia\r\nwas slain as a representative of the spirit of the grove, it might\r\nhave been objected that such a custom has no analogy in classical\r\nantiquity. But reasons have now been given for believing that the\r\nhuman being periodically and occasionally slain by the Asiatic\r\nGreeks was regularly treated as an embodiment of a divinity of\r\nvegetation. Probably the persons whom the Athenians kept to be\r\nsacrificed were similarly treated as divine. That they were social\r\noutcasts did not matter. On the primitive view a man is not chosen\r\nto be the mouth-piece or embodiment of a god on account of his high\r\nmoral qualities or social rank. The divine afflatus descends equally\r\non the good and the bad, the lofty and the lowly. If then the\r\ncivilised Greeks of Asia and Athens habitually sacrificed men whom\r\nthey regarded as incarnate gods, there can be no inherent\r\nimprobability in the supposition that at the dawn of history a\r\nsimilar custom was observed by the semibarbarous Latins in the\r\nArician Grove.\r\n\r\nBut to clinch the argument, it is clearly desirable to prove that\r\nthe custom of putting to death a human representative of a god was\r\nknown and practised in ancient Italy elsewhere than in the Arician\r\nGrove. This proof I now propose to adduce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The Roman Saturnalia\r\n\r\nWE have seen that many peoples have been used to observe an annual\r\nperiod of license, when the customary restraints of law and morality\r\nare thrown aside, when the whole population give themselves up to\r\nextravagant mirth and jollity, and when the darker passions find a\r\nvent which would never be allowed them in the more staid and sober\r\ncourse of ordinary life. Such outbursts of the pent-up forces of\r\nhuman nature, too often degenerating into wild orgies of lust and\r\ncrime, occur most commonly at the end of the year, and are\r\nfrequently associated, as I have had occasion to point out, with one\r\nor other of the agricultural seasons, especially with the time of\r\nsowing or of harvest. Now, of all these periods of license the one\r\nwhich is best known and which in modern language has given its name\r\nto the rest, is the Saturnalia. This famous festival fell in\r\nDecember, the last month of the Roman year, and was popularly\r\nsupposed to commemorate the merry reign of Saturn, the god of sowing\r\nand of husbandry, who lived on earth long ago as a righteous and\r\nbeneficent king of Italy, drew the rude and scattered dwellers on\r\nthe mountains together, taught them to till the ground, gave them\r\nlaws, and ruled in peace. His reign was the fabled Golden Age: the\r\nearth brought forth abundantly: no sound of war or discord troubled\r\nthe happy world: no baleful love of lucre worked like poison in the\r\nblood of the industrious and contented peasantry. Slavery and\r\nprivate property were alike unknown: all men had all things in\r\ncommon. At last the good god, the kindly king, vanished suddenly;\r\nbut his memory was cherished to distant ages, shrines were reared in\r\nhis honour, and many hills and high places in Italy bore his name.\r\nYet the bright tradition of his reign was crossed by a dark shadow:\r\nhis altars are said to have been stained with the blood of human\r\nvictims, for whom a more merciful age afterwards substituted\r\neffigies. Of this gloomy side of the god\'s religion there is little\r\nor no trace in the descriptions which ancient writers have left us\r\nof the Saturnalia. Feasting and revelry and all the mad pursuit of\r\npleasure are the features that seem to have especially marked this\r\ncarnival of antiquity, as it went on for seven days in the streets\r\nand public squares and houses of ancient Rome from the seventeenth\r\nto the twenty-third of December.\r\n\r\nBut no feature of the festival is more remarkable, nothing in it\r\nseems to have struck the ancients themselves more than the license\r\ngranted to slaves at this time. The distinction between the free and\r\nthe servile classes was temporarily abolished. The slave might rail\r\nat his master, intoxicate himself like his betters, sit down at\r\ntable with them, and not even a word of reproof would be\r\nadministered to him for conduct which at any other season might have\r\nbeen punished with stripes, imprisonment, or death. Nay, more,\r\nmasters actually changed places with their slaves and waited on them\r\nat table; and not till the serf had done eating and drinking was the\r\nboard cleared and dinner set for his master. So far was this\r\ninversion of ranks carried, that each household became for a time a\r\nmimic republic in which the high offices of state were discharged by\r\nthe slaves, who gave their orders and laid down the law as if they\r\nwere indeed invested with all the dignity of the consulship, the\r\npraetorship, and the bench. Like the pale reflection of power thus\r\naccorded to bondsmen at the Saturnalia was the mock kingship for\r\nwhich freemen cast lots at the same season. The person on whom the\r\nlot fell enjoyed the title of king, and issued commands of a playful\r\nand ludicrous nature to his temporary subjects. One of them he might\r\norder to mix the wine, another to drink, another to sing, another to\r\ndance, another to speak in his own dispraise, another to carry a\r\nflute-girl on his back round the house.\r\n\r\nNow, when we remember that the liberty allowed to slaves at this\r\nfestive season was supposed to be an imitation of the state of\r\nsociety in Saturn\'s time, and that in general the Saturnalia passed\r\nfor nothing more or less than a temporary revival or restoration of\r\nthe reign of that merry monarch, we are tempted to surmise that the\r\nmock king who presided over the revels may have originally\r\nrepresented Saturn himself. The conjecture is strongly confirmed, if\r\nnot established, by a very curious and interesting account of the\r\nway in which the Saturnalia was celebrated by the Roman soldiers\r\nstationed on the Danube in the reign of Maximian and Diocletian. The\r\naccount is preserved in a narrative of the martyrdom of St. Dasius,\r\nwhich was unearthed from a Greek manuscript in the Paris library,\r\nand published by Professor Franz Cumont of Ghent. Two briefer\r\ndescriptions of the event and of the custom are contained in\r\nmanuscripts at Milan and Berlin; one of them had already seen the\r\nlight in an obscure volume printed at Urbino in 1727, but its\r\nimportance for the history of the Roman religion, both ancient and\r\nmodern, appears to have been overlooked until Professor Cumont drew\r\nthe attention of scholars to all three narratives by publishing them\r\ntogether some years ago. According to these narratives, which have\r\nall the appearance of being authentic, and of which the longest is\r\nprobably based on official documents, the Roman soldiers at\r\nDurostorum in Lower Moesia celebrated the Saturnalia year by year in\r\nthe following manner. Thirty days before the festival they chose by\r\nlot from amongst themselves a young and handsome man, who was then\r\nclothed in royal attire to resemble Saturn. Thus arrayed and\r\nattended by a multitude of soldiers he went about in public with\r\nfull license to indulge his passions and to taste of every pleasure,\r\nhowever base and shameful. But if his reign was merry, it was short\r\nand ended tragically; for when the thirty days were up and the\r\nfestival of Saturn had come, he cut his own throat on the altar of\r\nthe god whom he personated. In the year A.D. 303 the lot fell upon\r\nthe Christian soldier Dasius, but he refused to play the part of the\r\nheathen god and soil his last days by debauchery. The threats and\r\narguments of his commanding officer Bassus failed to shake his\r\nconstancy, and accordingly he was beheaded, as the Christian\r\nmartyrologist records with minute accuracy, at Durostorum by the\r\nsoldier John on Friday the twentieth day of November, being the\r\ntwenty-fourth day of the moon, at the fourth hour.\r\n\r\nSince this narrative was published by Professor Cumont, its\r\nhistorical character, which had been doubted or denied, has received\r\nstrong confirmation from an interesting discovery. In the crypt of\r\nthe cathedral which crowns the promontory of Ancona there is\r\npreserved, among other remarkable antiquities, a white marble\r\nsarcophagus bearing a Greek inscription, in characters of the age of\r\nJustinian, to the following effect: "Here lies the holy martyr\r\nDasius, brought from Durostorum." The sarcophagus was transferred to\r\nthe crypt of the cathedral in 1848 from the church of San\r\nPellegrino, under the high altar of which, as we learn from a Latin\r\ninscription let into the masonry, the martyr\'s bones still repose\r\nwith those of two other saints. How long the sarcophagus was\r\ndeposited in the church of San Pellegrino, we do not know; but it is\r\nrecorded to have been there in the year 1650. We may suppose that\r\nthe saint\'s relics were transferred for safety to Ancona at some\r\ntime in the troubled centuries which followed his martyrdom, when\r\nMoesia was occupied and ravaged by successive hordes of barbarian\r\ninvaders. At all events it appears certain from the independent and\r\nmutually confirmatory evidence of the martyrology and the monuments\r\nthat Dasius was no mythical saint, but a real man, who suffered\r\ndeath for his faith at Durostorum in one of the early centuries of\r\nthe Christian era. Finding the narrative of the nameless\r\nmartyrologist thus established as to the principal fact recorded,\r\nnamely, the martyrdom of St. Dasius, we may reasonably accept his\r\ntestimony as to the manner and cause of the martyrdom, all the more\r\nbecause his narrative is precise, circumstantial, and entirely free\r\nfrom the miraculous element. Accordingly I conclude that the account\r\nwhich he gives of the celebration of the Saturnalia among the Roman\r\nsoldiers is trustworthy.\r\n\r\nThis account sets in a new and lurid light the office of the King of\r\nthe Saturnalia, the ancient Lord of Misrule, who presided over the\r\nwinter revels at Rome in the time of Horace and Tacitus. It seems to\r\nprove that his business had not always been that of a mere harlequin\r\nor merry-andrew whose only care was that the revelry should run high\r\nand the fun grow fast and furious, while the fire blazed and\r\ncrackled on the hearth, while the streets swarmed with festive\r\ncrowds, and through the clear frosty air, far away to the north,\r\nSoracte showed his coronal of snow. When we compare this comic\r\nmonarch of the gay, the civilised metropolis with his grim\r\ncounterpart of the rude camp on the Danube, and when we remember the\r\nlong array of similar figures, ludicrous yet tragic, who in other\r\nages and in other lands, wearing mock crowns and wrapped in sceptred\r\npalls, have played their little pranks for a few brief hours or\r\ndays, then passed before their time to a violent death, we can\r\nhardly doubt that in the King of the Saturnalia at Rome, as he is\r\ndepicted by classical writers, we see only a feeble emasculated copy\r\nof that original, whose strong features have been fortunately\r\npreserved for us by the obscure author of the _Martyrdom of St.\r\nDasius._ In other words, the martyrologist\'s account of the\r\nSaturnalia agrees so closely with the accounts of similar rites\r\nelsewhere which could not possibly have been known to him, that the\r\nsubstantial accuracy of his description may be regarded as\r\nestablished; and further, since the custom of putting a mock king to\r\ndeath as a representative of a god cannot have grown out of a\r\npractice of appointing him to preside over a holiday revel, whereas\r\nthe reverse may very well have happened, we are justified in\r\nassuming that in an earlier and more barbarous age it was the\r\nuniversal practice in ancient Italy, wherever the worship of Saturn\r\nprevailed, to choose a man who played the part and enjoyed all the\r\ntraditionary privileges of Saturn for a season, and then died,\r\nwhether by his own or another\'s hand, whether by the knife or the\r\nfire or on the gallows-tree, in the character of the good god who\r\ngave his life for the world. In Rome itself and other great towns\r\nthe growth of civilisation had probably mitigated this cruel custom\r\nlong before the Augustan age, and transformed it into the innocent\r\nshape it wears in the writings of the few classical writers who\r\nbestow a passing notice on the holiday King of the Saturnalia. But\r\nin remoter districts the older and sterner practice may long have\r\nsurvived; and even if after the unification of Italy the barbarous\r\nusage was suppressed by the Roman government, the memory of it would\r\nbe handed down by the peasants and would tend from time to time, as\r\nstill happens with the lowest forms of superstition among ourselves,\r\nto lead to a recrudescence of the practice, especially among the\r\nrude soldiery on the outskirts of the empire over whom the once iron\r\nhand of Rome was beginning to relax its grasp.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance between the Saturnalia of ancient and the Carnival\r\nof modern Italy has often been remarked; but in the light of all the\r\nfacts that have come before us, we may well ask whether the\r\nresemblance does not amount to identity. We have seen that in Italy,\r\nSpain, and France, that is, in the countries where the influence of\r\nRome has been deepest and most lasting, a conspicuous feature of the\r\nCarnival is a burlesque figure personifying the festive season,\r\nwhich after a short career of glory and dissipation is publicly\r\nshot, burnt, or otherwise destroyed, to the feigned grief or genuine\r\ndelight of the populace. If the view here suggested of the Carnival\r\nis correct, this grotesque personage is no other than a direct\r\nsuccessor of the old King of the Saturnalia, the master of the\r\nrevels, the real man who personated Saturn and, when the revels were\r\nover, suffered a real death in his assumed character. The King of\r\nthe Bean on Twelfth Night and the mediaeval Bishop of Fools, Abbot\r\nof Unreason, or Lord of Misrule are figures of the same sort and may\r\nperhaps have had a similar origin. Whether that was so or not, we\r\nmay conclude with a fair degree of probability that if the King of\r\nthe Wood at Aricia lived and died as an incarnation of a sylvan\r\ndeity, he had of old a parallel at Rome in the men who, year by\r\nyear, were slain in the character of King Saturn, the god of the\r\nsown and sprouting seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIX. Killing the God in Mexico\r\n\r\nBY NO PEOPLE does the custom of sacrificing the human representative\r\nof a god appear to have been observed so commonly and with so much\r\nsolemnity as by the Aztecs of ancient Mexico. With the ritual of\r\nthese remarkable sacrifices we are well acquainted, for it has been\r\nfully described by the Spaniards who conquered Mexico in the\r\nsixteenth century, and whose curiosity was naturally excited by the\r\ndiscovery in this distant region of a barbarous and cruel religion\r\nwhich presented many curious points of analogy to the doctrine and\r\nritual of their own church. "They took a captive," says the Jesuit\r\nAcosta, "such as they thought good; and afore they did sacrifice him\r\nunto their idols, they gave him the name of the idol, to whom he\r\nshould be sacrificed, and apparelled him with the same ornaments\r\nlike their idol, saying, that he did represent the same idol. And\r\nduring the time that this representation lasted, which was for a\r\nyear in some feasts, in others six months, and in others less, they\r\nreverenced and worshipped him in the same manner as the proper idol;\r\nand in the meantime he did eat, drink, and was merry. When he went\r\nthrough the streets, the people came forth to worship him, and every\r\none brought him an alms, with children and sick folks, that he might\r\ncure them, and bless them, suffering him to do all things at his\r\npleasure, only he was accompanied with ten or twelve men lest he\r\nshould fly. And he (to the end he might be reverenced as he passed)\r\nsometimes sounded upon a small flute, that the people might prepare\r\nto worship him. The feast being come, and he grown fat, they killed\r\nhim, opened him, and ate him, making a solemn sacrifice of him."\r\n\r\nThis general description of the custom may now be illustrated by\r\nparticular examples. Thus at the festival called Toxcatl, the\r\ngreatest festival of the Mexican year, a young man was annually\r\nsacrificed in the character of Tezcatlipoca, "the god of gods,"\r\nafter having been maintained and worshipped as that great deity in\r\nperson for a whole year. According to the old Franciscan monk\r\nSahagun, our best authority on the Aztec religion, the sacrifice of\r\nthe human god fell at Easter or a few days later, so that, if he is\r\nright, it would correspond in date as well as in character to the\r\nChristian festival of the death and resurrection of the Redeemer.\r\nMore exactly he tells us that the sacrifice took place on the first\r\nday of the fifth Aztec month, which according to him began on the\r\ntwenty-third or twenty-seventh day of April.\r\n\r\nAt this festival the great god died in the person of one human\r\nrepresentative and came to life again in the person of another, who\r\nwas destined to enjoy the fatal honour of divinity for a year and to\r\nperish, like all his predecessors, at the end of it. The young man\r\nsingled out for this high dignity was carefully chosen from among\r\nthe captives on the ground of his personal beauty. He had to be of\r\nunblemished body, slim as a reed and straight as a pillar, neither\r\ntoo tall nor too short. If through high living he grew too fat, he\r\nwas obliged to reduce himself by drinking salt water. And in order\r\nthat he might behave in his lofty station with becoming grace and\r\ndignity he was carefully trained to comport himself like a gentleman\r\nof the first quality, to speak correctly and elegantly, to play the\r\nflute, to smoke cigars and to snuff at flowers with a dandified air.\r\nHe was honourably lodged in the temple, where the nobles waited on\r\nhim and paid him homage, bringing him meat and serving him like a\r\nprince. The king himself saw to it that he was apparelled in\r\ngorgeous attire, "for already he esteemed him as a god." Eagle down\r\nwas gummed to his head and white cock\'s feathers were stuck in his\r\nhair, which drooped to his girdle. A wreath of flowers like roasted\r\nmaize crowned his brows, and a garland of the same flowers passed\r\nover his shoulders and under his armpits. Golden ornaments hung from\r\nhis nose, golden armlets adorned his arms, golden bells jingled on\r\nhis legs at every step he took; earrings of turquoise dangled from\r\nhis ears, bracelets of turquoise bedecked his wrists; necklaces of\r\nshells encircled his neck and depended on his breast; he wore a\r\nmantle of network, and round his middle a rich waistcloth. When this\r\nbejewelled exquisite lounged through the streets playing on his\r\nflute, puffing at a cigar, and smelling at a nosegay, the people\r\nwhom he met threw themselves on the earth before him and prayed to\r\nhim with sighs and tears, taking up the dust in their hands and\r\nputting it in their mouths in token of the deepest humiliation and\r\nsubjection. Women came forth with children in their arms and\r\npresented them to him, saluting him as a god. For "he passed for our\r\nLord God; the people acknowledged him as the Lord." All who thus\r\nworshipped him on his passage he saluted gravely and courteously.\r\nLest he should flee, he was everywhere attended by a guard of eight\r\npages in the royal livery, four of them with shaven crowns like the\r\npalace-slaves, and four of them with the flowing locks of warriors;\r\nand if he contrived to escape, the captain of the guard had to take\r\nhis place as the representative of the god and to die in his stead.\r\nTwenty days before he was to die, his costume was changed, and four\r\ndamsels delicately nurtured and bearing the names of four\r\ngoddesses--the Goddess of Flowers, the Goddess of the Young Maize,\r\nthe Goddess "Our Mother among the Water," and the Goddess of\r\nSalt--were given him to be his brides, and with them he consorted.\r\nDuring the last five days divine honours were showered on the\r\ndestined victim. The king remained in his palace while the whole\r\ncourt went after the human god. Solemn banquets and dances followed\r\neach other in regular succession and at appointed places. On the\r\nlast day the young man, attended by his wives and pages, embarked in\r\na canoe covered with a royal canopy and was ferried across the lake\r\nto a spot where a little hill rose from the edge of the water. It\r\nwas called the Mountain of Parting, because there his wives bade him\r\na last farewell. Then, accompanied only by his pages, he repaired to\r\na small and lonely temple by the wayside. Like the Mexican temples\r\nin general, it was built in the form of a pyramid; and as the young\r\nman ascended the stairs he broke at every step one of the flutes on\r\nwhich he had played in the days of his glory. On reaching the summit\r\nhe was seized and held down by the priests on his back upon a block\r\nof stone, while one of them cut open his breast, thrust his hand\r\ninto the wound, and wrenching out his heart held it up in sacrifice\r\nto the sun. The body of the dead god was not, like the bodies of\r\ncommon victims, sent rolling down the steps of the temple, but was\r\ncarried down to the foot, where the head was cut off and spitted on\r\na pike. Such was the regular end of the man who personated the\r\ngreatest god of the Mexican pantheon.\r\n\r\nThe honour of living for a short time in the character of a god and\r\ndying a violent death in the same capacity was not restricted to men\r\nin Mexico; women were allowed, or rather compelled, to enjoy the\r\nglory and to share the doom as representatives of goddesses. Thus at\r\na great festival in September, which was preceded by a strict fast\r\nof seven days, they sanctified a young slave girl of twelve or\r\nthirteen years, the prettiest they could find, to represent the\r\nMaize Goddess Chicomecohuatl. They invested her with the ornaments\r\nof the goddess, putting a mitre on her head and maize-cobs round her\r\nneck and in her hands, and fastening a green feather upright on the\r\ncrown of her head to imitate an ear of maize. This they did, we are\r\ntold, in order to signify that the maize was almost ripe at the time\r\nof the festival, but because it was still tender they chose a girl\r\nof tender years to play the part of the Maize Goddess. The whole\r\nlong day they led the poor child in all her finery, with the green\r\nplume nodding on her head, from house to house dancing merrily to\r\ncheer people after the dulness and privations of the fast.\r\n\r\nIn the evening all the people assembled at the temple, the courts of\r\nwhich they lit up by a multitude of lanterns and candles. There they\r\npassed the night without sleeping, and at midnight, while the\r\ntrumpets, flutes, and horns discoursed solemn music, a portable\r\nframework or palanquin was brought forth, bedecked with festoons of\r\nmaize-cobs and peppers and filled with seeds of all sorts. This the\r\nbearers set down at the door of the chamber in which the wooden\r\nimage of the goddess stood. Now the chamber was adorned and\r\nwreathed, both outside and inside, with wreaths of maize-cobs,\r\npeppers, pumpkins, roses, and seeds of every kind, a wonder to\r\nbehold; the whole floor was covered deep with these verdant\r\nofferings of the pious. When the music ceased, a solemn procession\r\ncame forth of priests and dignitaries, with flaring lights and\r\nsmoking censers, leading in their midst the girl who played the part\r\nof the goddess. Then they made her mount the framework, where she\r\nstood upright on the maize and peppers and pumpkins with which it\r\nwas strewed, her hands resting on two bannisters to keep her from\r\nfalling. Then the priests swung the smoking censers round her; the\r\nmusic struck up again, and while it played, a great dignitary of the\r\ntemple suddenly stepped up to her with a razor in his hand and\r\nadroitly shore off the green feather she wore on her head, together\r\nwith the hair in which it was fastened, snipping the lock off by the\r\nroot. The feather and the hair he then presented to the wooden image\r\nof the goddess with great solemnity and elaborate ceremonies,\r\nweeping and giving her thanks for the fruits of the earth and the\r\nabundant crops which she had bestowed on the people that year; and\r\nas he wept and prayed, all the people, standing in the courts of the\r\ntemple, wept and prayed with him. When that ceremony was over, the\r\ngirl descended from the framework and was escorted to the place\r\nwhere she was to spend the rest of the night. But all the people\r\nkept watch in the courts of the temple by the light of torches till\r\nbreak of day.\r\n\r\nThe morning being come, and the courts of the temple being still\r\ncrowded by the multitude, who would have deemed it sacrilege to quit\r\nthe precincts, the priests again brought forth the damsel attired in\r\nthe costume of the goddess, with the mitre on her head and the cobs\r\nof maize about her neck. Again she mounted the portable framework or\r\npalanquin and stood on it, supporting herself by her hands on the\r\nbannisters. Then the elders of the temple lifted it on their\r\nshoulders, and while some swung burning censers and others played on\r\ninstruments or sang, they carried it in procession through the great\r\ncourtyard to the hall of the god Huitzilopochtli and then back to\r\nthe chamber, where stood the wooden image of the Maize Goddess, whom\r\nthe girl personated. There they caused the damsel to descend from\r\nthe palanquin and to stand on the heaps of corn and vegetables that\r\nhad been spread in profusion on the floor of the sacred chamber.\r\nWhile she stood there all the elders and nobles came in a line, one\r\nbehind the other, carrying saucers full of dry and clotted blood\r\nwhich they had drawn from their ears by way of penance during the\r\nseven days\' fast. One by one they squatted on their haunches before\r\nher, which was the equivalent of falling on their knees with us, and\r\nscraping the crust of blood from the saucer cast it down before her\r\nas an offering in return for the benefits which she, as the\r\nembodiment of the Maize Goddess, had conferred upon them. When the\r\nmen had thus humbly offered their blood to the human representative\r\nof the goddess, the women, forming a long line, did so likewise,\r\neach of them dropping on her hams before the girl and scraping her\r\nblood from the saucer. The ceremony lasted a long time, for great\r\nand small, young and old, all without exception had to pass before\r\nthe incarnate deity and make their offering. When it was over, the\r\npeople returned home with glad hearts to feast on flesh and viands\r\nof every sort as merrily, we are told, as good Christians at Easter\r\npartake of meat and other carnal mercies after the long abstinence\r\nof Lent. And when they had eaten and drunk their fill and rested\r\nafter the night watch, they returned quite refreshed to the temple\r\nto see the end of the festival. And the end of the festival was\r\nthis. The multitude being assembled, the priests solemnly incensed\r\nthe girl who personated the goddess; then they threw her on her back\r\non the heap of corn and seeds, cut off her head, caught the gushing\r\nblood in a tub, and sprinkled the blood on the wooden image of the\r\ngoddess, the walls of the chamber, and the offerings of corn,\r\npeppers, pumpkins, seeds, and vegetables which cumbered the floor.\r\nAfter that they flayed the headless trunk, and one of the priests\r\nmade shift to squeeze himself into the bloody skin. Having done so\r\nthey clad him in all the robes which the girl had worn; they put the\r\nmitre on his head, the necklace of golden maize-cobs about his neck,\r\nthe maize-cobs of feathers and gold in his hands; and thus arrayed\r\nthey led him forth in public, all of them dancing to the tuck of\r\ndrum, while he acted as fugleman, skipping and posturing at the head\r\nof the procession as briskly as he could be expected to do,\r\nincommoded as he was by the tight and clammy skin of the girl and by\r\nher clothes, which must have been much too small for a grown man.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing custom the identification of the young girl with\r\nthe Maize Goddess appears to be complete. The golden maize-cobs\r\nwhich she wore round her neck, the artificial maize-cobs which she\r\ncarried in her hands, the green feather which was stuck in her hair\r\nin imitation (we are told) of a green ear of maize, all set her\r\nforth as a personification of the corn-spirit; and we are expressly\r\ninformed that she was specially chosen as a young girl to represent\r\nthe young maize, which at the time of the festival had not yet fully\r\nripened. Further, her identification with the corn and the\r\ncorn-goddess was clearly announced by making her stand on the heaps\r\nof maize and there receive the homage and blood-offerings of the\r\nwhole people, who thereby returned her thanks for the benefits which\r\nin her character of a divinity she was supposed to have conferred\r\nupon them. Once more, the practice of beheading her on a heap of\r\ncorn and seeds and sprinkling her blood, not only on the image of\r\nthe Maize Goddess, but on the piles of maize, peppers, pumpkins,\r\nseeds, and vegetables, can seemingly have had no other object but to\r\nquicken and strengthen the crops of corn and the fruits of the earth\r\nin general by infusing into their representatives the blood of the\r\nCorn Goddess herself. The analogy of this Mexican sacrifice, the\r\nmeaning of which appears to be indisputable, may be allowed to\r\nstrengthen the interpretation which I have given of other human\r\nsacrifices offered for the crops. If the Mexican girl, whose blood\r\nwas sprinkled on the maize, indeed personated the Maize Goddess, it\r\nbecomes more than ever probable that the girl whose blood the\r\nPawnees similarly sprinkled on the seed corn personated in like\r\nmanner the female Spirit of the Corn; and so with the other human\r\nbeings whom other races have slaughtered for the sake of promoting\r\nthe growth of the crops.\r\n\r\nLastly, the concluding act of the sacred drama, in which the body of\r\nthe dead Maize Goddess was flayed and her skin worn, together with\r\nall her sacred insignia, by a man who danced before the people in\r\nthis grim attire, seems to be best explained on the hypothesis that\r\nit was intended to ensure that the divine death should be\r\nimmediately followed by the divine resurrection. If that was so, we\r\nmay infer with some degree of probability that the practice of\r\nkilling a human representative of a deity has commonly, perhaps\r\nalways, been regarded merely as a means of perpetuating the divine\r\nenergies in the fulness of youthful vigour, untainted by the\r\nweakness and frailty of age, from which they must have suffered if\r\nthe deity had been allowed to die a natural death.\r\n\r\nThese Mexican rites suffice to prove that human sacrifices of the\r\nsort I suppose to have prevailed at Aricia were, as a matter of\r\nfact, regularly offered by a people whose level of culture was\r\nprobably not inferior, if indeed it was not distinctly superior, to\r\nthat occupied by the Italian races at the early period to which the\r\norigin of the Arician priesthood must be referred. The positive and\r\nindubitable evidence of the prevalence of such sacrifices in one\r\npart of the world may reasonably be allowed to strengthen the\r\nprobability of their prevalence in places for which the evidence is\r\nless full and trustworthy. Taken all together, the facts which we\r\nhave passed in review seem to show that the custom of killing men\r\nwhom their worshippers regard as divine has prevailed in many parts\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLX. Between Heaven and Earth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Not to touch the Earth\r\n\r\nAT THE OUTSET of this book two questions were proposed for answer:\r\nWhy had the priest of Aricia to slay his predecessor? And why,\r\nbefore doing so, had he to pluck the Golden Bough? Of these two\r\nquestions the first has now been answered. The priest of Aricia, if\r\nI am right, was one of those sacred kings or human divinities on\r\nwhose life the welfare of the community and even the course of\r\nnature in general are believed to be intimately dependent. It does\r\nnot appear that the subjects or worshippers of such a spiritual\r\npotentate form to themselves any very clear notion of the exact\r\nrelationship in which they stand to him; probably their ideas on the\r\npoint are vague and fluctuating, and we should err if we attempted\r\nto define the relationship with logical precision. All that the\r\npeople know, or rather imagine, is that somehow they themselves,\r\ntheir cattle, and their crops are mysteriously bound up with their\r\ndivine king, so that according as he is well or ill the community is\r\nhealthy or sickly, the flocks and herds thrive or languish with\r\ndisease, and the fields yield an abundant or a scanty harvest. The\r\nworst evil which they can conceive of is the natural death of their\r\nruler, whether he succumb to sickness or old age, for in the opinion\r\nof his followers such a death would entail the most disastrous\r\nconsequences on themselves and their possessions; fatal epidemics\r\nwould sweep away man and beast, the earth would refuse her increase,\r\nnay, the very frame of nature itself might be dissolved. To guard\r\nagainst these catastrophes it is necessary to put the king to death\r\nwhile he is still in the full bloom of his divine manhood, in order\r\nthat his sacred life, transmitted in unabated force to his\r\nsuccessor, may renew its youth, and thus by successive transmissions\r\nthrough a perpetual line of vigorous incarnations may remain\r\neternally fresh and young, a pledge and security that men and\r\nanimals shall in like manner renew their youth by a perpetual\r\nsuccession of generations, and that seedtime and harvest, and summer\r\nand winter, and rain and sunshine shall never fail. That, if my\r\nconjecture is right, was why the priest of Aricia, the King of the\r\nWood at Nemi, had regularly to perish by the sword of his successor.\r\n\r\nBut we have still to ask, What was the Golden Bough? and why had\r\neach candidate for the Arician priesthood to pluck it before he\r\ncould slay the priest? These questions I will now try to answer.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to begin by noticing two of those rules or taboos by\r\nwhich, as we have seen, the life of divine kings or priests is\r\nregulated. The first of the rules to which I would call the reader\'s\r\nattention is that the divine personage may not touch the ground with\r\nhis foot. This rule was observed by the supreme pontiff of the\r\nZapotecs in Mexico; he profaned his sanctity if he so much as\r\ntouched the ground with his foot. Montezuma, emperor of Mexico,\r\nnever set foot on the ground; he was always carried on the shoulders\r\nof noblemen, and if he lighted anywhere they laid rich tapestry for\r\nhim to walk upon. For the Mikado of Japan to touch the ground with\r\nhis foot was a shameful degradation; indeed, in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, it was enough to deprive him of his office. Outside his\r\npalace he was carried on men\'s shoulders; within it he walked on\r\nexquisitely wrought mats. The king and queen of Tahiti might not\r\ntouch the ground anywhere but within their hereditary domains; for\r\nthe ground on which they trod became sacred. In travelling from\r\nplace to place they were carried on the shoulders of sacred men.\r\nThey were always accompanied by several pairs of these sanctified\r\nattendants; and when it became necessary to change their bearers,\r\nthe king and queen vaulted on to the shoulders of their new bearers\r\nwithout letting their feet touch the ground. It was an evil omen if\r\nthe king of Dosuma touched the ground, and he had to perform an\r\nexpiatory ceremony. Within his palace the king of Persia walked on\r\ncarpets on which no one else might tread; outside of it he was never\r\nseen on foot but only in a chariot or on horseback. In old days the\r\nking of Siam never set foot upon the earth, but was carried on a\r\nthrone of gold from place to place. Formerly neither the kings of\r\nUganda, nor their mothers, nor their queens might walk on foot\r\noutside of the spacious enclosures in which they lived. Whenever\r\nthey went forth they were carried on the shoulders of men of the\r\nBuffalo clan, several of whom accompanied any of these royal\r\npersonages on a journey and took it in turn to bear the burden. The\r\nking sat astride the bearer\'s neck with a leg over each shoulder and\r\nhis feet tucked under the bearer\'s arms. When one of these royal\r\ncarriers grew tired he shot the king onto the shoulders of a second\r\nman without allowing the royal feet to touch the ground. In this way\r\nthey went at a great pace and travelled long distances in a day,\r\nwhen the king was on a journey. The bearers had a special hut in the\r\nking\'s enclosure in order to be at hand the moment they were wanted.\r\nAmong the Bakuba, or rather Bushongo, a nation in the southern\r\nregion of the Congo, down to a few years ago persons of the royal\r\nblood were forbidden to touch the ground; they must sit on a hide, a\r\nchair, or the back of a slave, who crouched on hands and feet; their\r\nfeet rested on the feet of others. When they travelled they were\r\ncarried on the backs of men; but the king journeyed in a litter\r\nsupported on shafts. Among the Ibo people about Awka, in Southern\r\nNigeria, the priest of the Earth has to observe many taboos; for\r\nexample, he may not see a corpse, and if he meets one on the road he\r\nmust hide his eyes with his wristlet. He must abstain from many\r\nfoods, such as eggs, birds of all sorts, mutton, dog, bush-buck, and\r\nso forth. He may neither wear nor touch a mask, and no masked man\r\nmay enter his house. If a dog enters his house, it is killed and\r\nthrown out. As priest of the Earth he may not sit on the bare\r\nground, nor eat things that have fallen on the ground, nor may earth\r\nbe thrown at him. According to ancient Brahmanic ritual a king at\r\nhis inauguration trod on a tiger\'s skin and a golden plate; he was\r\nshod with shoes of boar\'s skin, and so long as he lived thereafter\r\nhe might not stand on the earth with his bare feet.\r\n\r\nBut besides persons who are permanently sacred or tabooed and are\r\ntherefore permanently forbidden to touch the ground with their feet,\r\nthere are others who enjoy the character of sanctity or taboo only\r\non certain occasions, and to whom accordingly the prohibition in\r\nquestion only applies at the definite seasons during which they\r\nexhale the odour of sanctity. Thus among the Kayans or Bahaus of\r\nCentral Borneo, while the priestesses are engaged in the performance\r\nof certain rites they may not step on the ground, and boards are\r\nlaid for them to tread on. Warriors, again, on the war-path are\r\nsurrounded, so to say, by an atmosphere of taboo; hence some Indians\r\nof North America might not sit on the bare ground the whole time\r\nthey were out on a warlike expedition. In Laos the hunting of\r\nelephants gives rise to many taboos; one of them is that the chief\r\nhunter may not touch the earth with his foot. Accordingly, when he\r\nalights from his elephant, the others spread a carpet of leaves for\r\nhim to step upon.\r\n\r\nApparently holiness, magical virtue, taboo, or whatever we may call\r\nthat mysterious quality which is supposed to pervade sacred or\r\ntabooed persons, is conceived by the primitive philosopher as a\r\nphysical substance or fluid, with which the sacred man is charged\r\njust as a Leyden jar is charged with electricity; and exactly as the\r\nelectricity in the jar can be discharged by contact with a good\r\nconductor, so the holiness or magical virtue in the man can be\r\ndischarged and drained away by contact with the earth, which on this\r\ntheory serves as an excellent conductor for the magical fluid. Hence\r\nin order to preserve the charge from running to waste, the sacred or\r\ntabooed personage must be carefully prevented from touching the\r\nground; in electrical language he must be insulated, if he is not to\r\nbe emptied of the precious substance or fluid with which he, as a\r\nvial, is filled to the brim. And in many cases apparently the\r\ninsulation of the tabooed person is recommended as a precaution not\r\nmerely for his own sake but for the sake of others; for since the\r\nvirtue of holiness or taboo is, so to say, a powerful explosive\r\nwhich the smallest touch may detonate, it is necessary in the\r\ninterest of the general safety to keep it within narrow bounds, lest\r\nbreaking out it should blast, blight, and destroy whatever it comes\r\ninto contact with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Not to see the Sun\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND rule to be here noted is that the sun may not shine upon\r\nthe divine person. This rule was observed both by the Mikado and by\r\nthe pontiff of the Zapotecs. The latter "was looked upon as a god\r\nwhom the earth was not worthy to hold, nor the sun to shine upon."\r\nThe Japanese would not allow that the Mikado should expose his\r\nsacred person to the open air, and the sun was not thought worthy to\r\nshine on his head. The Indians of Granada, in South America, "kept\r\nthose who were to be rulers or commanders, whether men or women,\r\nlocked up for several years when they were children, some of them\r\nseven years, and this so close that they were not to see the sun,\r\nfor if they should happen to see it they forfeited their lordship,\r\neating certain sorts of food appointed; and those who were their\r\nkeepers at certain times went into their retreat or prison and\r\nscourged them severely." Thus, for example, the heir to the throne\r\nof Bogota, who was not the son but the sister\'s son of the king, had\r\nto undergo a rigorous training from his infancy; he lived in\r\ncomplete retirement in a temple, where he might not see the sun nor\r\neat salt nor converse with a woman; he was surrounded by guards who\r\nobserved his conduct and noted all his actions; if he broke a single\r\none of the rules laid down for him, he was deemed infamous and\r\nforfeited all his rights to the throne. So, too, the heir to the\r\nkingdom of Sogamoso, before succeeding to the crown, had to fast for\r\nseven years in the temple, being shut up in the dark and not allowed\r\nto see the sun or light. The prince who was to become Inca of Peru\r\nhad to fast for a month without seeing light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The Seclusion of Girls at Puberty\r\n\r\nNOW it is remarkable that the foregoing two rules--not to touch the\r\nground and not to see the sun--are observed either separately or\r\nconjointly by girls at puberty in many parts of the world. Thus\r\namongst the negroes of Loango girls at puberty are confined in\r\nseparate huts, and they may not touch the ground with any part of\r\ntheir bare body. Among the Zulus and kindred tribes of South Africa,\r\nwhen the first signs of puberty show themselves "while a girl is\r\nwalking, gathering wood, or working in the field, she runs to the\r\nriver and hides herself among the reeds for the day, so as not to be\r\nseen by men. She covers her head carefully with her blanket that the\r\nsun may not shine on it and shrivel her up into a withered skeleton,\r\nas would result from exposure to the sun\'s beams. After dark she\r\nreturns to her home and is secluded" in a hut for some time. With\r\nthe Awa-nkonde, a tribe at the northern end of Lake Nyassa, it is a\r\nrule that after her first menstruation a girl must be kept apart,\r\nwith a few companions of her own sex, in a darkened house. The floor\r\nis covered with dry banana leaves, but no fire may be lit in the\r\nhouse, which is called "the house of the Awasungu," that is, "of\r\nmaidens who have no hearts."\r\n\r\nIn New Ireland girls are confined for four or five years in small\r\ncages, being kept in the dark and not allowed to set foot on the\r\nground. The custom has been thus described by an eye-witness. "I\r\nheard from a teacher about some strange custom connected with some\r\nof the young girls here, so I asked the chief to take me to the\r\nhouse where they were. The house was about twenty-five feet in\r\nlength, and stood in a reed and bamboo enclosure, across the\r\nentrance to which a bundle of dried grass was suspended to show that\r\nit was strictly \'_tabu._\' Inside the house were three conical\r\nstructures about seven or eight feet in height, and about ten or\r\ntwelve feet in circumference at the bottom, and for about four feet\r\nfrom the ground, at which point they tapered off to a point at the\r\ntop. These cages were made of the broad leaves of the pandanus-tree,\r\nsewn quite close together so that no light and little or no air\r\ncould enter. On one side of each is an opening which is closed by a\r\ndouble door of plaited cocoa-nut tree and pandanus-tree leaves.\r\nAbout three feet from the ground there is a stage of bamboos which\r\nforms the floor. In each of these cages we were told there was a\r\nyoung woman confined, each of whom had to remain for at least four\r\nor five years, without ever being allowed to go outside the house. I\r\ncould scarcely credit the story when I heard it; the whole thing\r\nseemed too horrible to be true. I spoke to the chief, and told him\r\nthat I wished to see the inside of the cages, and also to see the\r\ngirls that I might make them a present of a few beads. He told me\r\nthat it was \'_tabu,_\' forbidden for any men but their own relations\r\nto look at them; but I suppose the promised beads acted as an\r\ninducement, and so he sent away for some old lady who had charge,\r\nand who alone is allowed to open the doors. While we were waiting we\r\ncould hear the girls talking to the chief in a querulous way as if\r\nobjecting to something or expressing their fears. The old woman came\r\nat length and certainly she did not seem a very pleasant jailor or\r\nguardian; nor did she seem to favour the request of the chief to\r\nallow us to see the girls, as she regarded us with anything but\r\npleasant looks. However, she had to undo the door when the chief\r\ntold her to do so, and then the girls peeped out at us, and, when\r\ntold to do so, they held out their hands for the beads. I, however,\r\npurposely sat at some distance away and merely held out the beads to\r\nthem, as I wished to draw them quite outside, that I might inspect\r\nthe inside of the cages. This desire of mine gave rise to another\r\ndifficulty, as these girls were not allowed to put their feet to the\r\nground all the time they were confined in these places. However,\r\nthey wished to get the beads, and so the old lady had to go outside\r\nand collect a lot of pieces of wood and bamboo, which she placed on\r\nthe ground, and then going to one of the girls, she helped her down\r\nand held her hand as she stepped from one piece of wood to another\r\nuntil she came near enough to get the beads I held out to her. I\r\nthen went to inspect the inside of the cage out of which she had\r\ncome, but could scarely put my head inside of it, the atmosphere was\r\nso hot and stifling. It was clean and contained nothing but a few\r\nshort lengths of bamboo for holding water. There was only room for\r\nthe girl to sit or lie down in a crouched position on the bamboo\r\nplatform, and when the doors are shut it must be nearly or quite\r\ndark inside. The girls are never allowed to come out except once a\r\nday to bathe in a dish or wooden bowl placed close to each cage.\r\nThey say that they perspire profusely. They are placed in these\r\nstifling cages when quite young, and must remain there until they\r\nare young women, when they are taken out and have each a great\r\nmarriage feast provided for them. One of them was about fourteen or\r\nfifteen years old, and the chief told us that she had been there for\r\nfive years, but would soon be taken out now. The other two were\r\nabout eight and ten years old, and they have to stay there for\r\nseveral years longer."\r\n\r\nIn Kabadi, a district of British New Guinea, "daughters of chiefs,\r\nwhen they are about twelve or thirteen years of age, are kept\r\nindoors for two or three years, never being allowed, under any\r\npretence, to descend from the house, and the house is so shaded that\r\nthe sun cannot shine on them." Among the Yabim and Bukaua, two\r\nneighbouring and kindred tribes on the coast of Northern New Guinea,\r\na girl at puberty is secluded for some five or six weeks in an inner\r\npart of the house; but she may not sit on the floor, lest her\r\nuncleanliness should cleave to it, so a log of wood is placed for\r\nher to squat on. Moreover, she may not touch the ground with her\r\nfeet; hence if she is obliged to quit the house for a short time,\r\nshe is muffled up in mats and walks on two halves of a coco-nut\r\nshell, which are fastened like sandals to her feet by creeping\r\nplants. Among the Ot Danoms of Borneo girls at the age of eight or\r\nten years are shut up in a little room or cell of the house, and cut\r\noff from all intercourse with the world for a long time. The cell,\r\nlike the rest of the house, is raised on piles above the ground, and\r\nis lit by a single small window opening on a lonely place, so that\r\nthe girl is in almost total darkness. She may not leave the room on\r\nany pretext whatever, not even for the most necessary purposes. None\r\nof her family may see her all the time she is shut up, but a single\r\nslave woman is appointed to wait on her. During her lonely\r\nconfinement, which often lasts seven years, the girl occupies\r\nherself in weaving mats or with other handiwork. Her bodily growth\r\nis stunted by the long want of exercise, and when, on attaining\r\nwomanhood, she is brought out, her complexion is pale and wax-like.\r\nShe is now shown the sun, the earth, the water, the trees, and the\r\nflowers, as if she were newly born. Then a great feast is made, a\r\nslave is killed, and the girl is smeared with his blood. In Ceram\r\ngirls at puberty were formerly shut up by themselves in a hut which\r\nwas kept dark. In Yap, one of the Caroline Islands, should a girl be\r\novertaken by her first menstruation on the public road, she may not\r\nsit down on the earth, but must beg for a coco-nut shell to put\r\nunder her. She is shut up for several days in a small hut at a\r\ndistance from her parents\' house, and afterwards she is bound to\r\nsleep for a hundred days in one of the special houses which are\r\nprovided for the use of menstruous women.\r\n\r\nIn the island of Mabuiag, Torres Straits, when the signs of puberty\r\nappear on a girl, a circle of bushes is made in a dark corner of the\r\nhouse. Here, decked with shoulder-belts, armlets, leglets just below\r\nthe knees, and anklets, wearing a chaplet on her head, and shell\r\nornaments in her ears, on her chest, and on her back, she squats in\r\nthe midst of the bushes, which are piled so high round about her\r\nthat only her head is visible. In this state of seclusion she must\r\nremain for three months. All this time the sun may not shine upon\r\nher, but at night she is allowed to slip out of the hut, and the\r\nbushes that hedge her in are then changed. She may not feed herself\r\nor handle food, but is fed by one or two old women, her maternal\r\naunts, who are especially appointed to look after her. One of these\r\nwomen cooks food for her at a special fire in the forest. The girl\r\nis forbidden to eat turtle or turtle eggs during the season when the\r\nturtles are breeding; but no vegetable food is refused her. No man,\r\nnot even her own father, may come into the house while her seclusion\r\nlasts; for if her father saw her at this time he would certainly\r\nhave bad luck in his fishing, and would probably smash his canoe the\r\nvery next time he went out in it. At the end of the three months she\r\nis carried down to a freshwater creek by her attendants, hanging on\r\nto their shoulders in such a way that her feet do not touch the\r\nground, while the women of the tribe form a ring round her, and thus\r\nescort her to the beach. Arrived at the shore, she is stripped of\r\nher ornaments, and the bearers stagger with her into the creek,\r\nwhere they immerse her, and all the other women join in splashing\r\nwater over both the girl and her bearers. When they come out of the\r\nwater one of the two attendants makes a heap of grass for her charge\r\nto squat upon. The other runs to the reef, catches a small crab,\r\ntears off its claws, and hastens back with them to the creek. Here\r\nin the meantime a fire has been kindled, and the claws are roasted\r\nat it. The girl is then fed by her attendants with the roasted\r\nclaws. After that she is freshly decorated, and the whole party\r\nmarches back to the village in a single rank, the girl walking in\r\nthe centre between her two old aunts, who hold her by the wrists.\r\nThe husbands of her aunts now receive her and lead her into the\r\nhouse of one of them, where all partake of food, and the girl is\r\nallowed once more to feed herself in the usual manner. A dance\r\nfollows, in which the girl takes a prominent part, dancing between\r\nthe husbands of the two aunts who had charge of her in her\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\nAmong the Yaraikanna tribe of Cape York Peninsula, in Northern\r\nQueensland, a girl at puberty is said to live by herself for a month\r\nor six weeks; no man may see her, though any woman may. She stays in\r\na hut or shelter specially made for her, on the floor of which she\r\nlies supine. She may not see the sun, and towards sunset she must\r\nkeep her eyes shut until the sun has gone down, otherwise it is\r\nthought that her nose will be diseased. During her seclusion she may\r\neat nothing that lives in salt water, or a snake would kill her. An\r\nold woman waits upon her and supplies her with roots, yams, and\r\nwater. Some Australian tribes are wont to bury their girls at such\r\nseasons more or less deeply in the ground, perhaps in order to hide\r\nthem from the light of the sun.\r\n\r\nAmong the Indians of California a girl at her first menstruation\r\n"was thought to be possessed of a particular degree of supernatural\r\npower, and this was not always regarded as entirely defiling or\r\nmalevolent. Often, however, there was a strong feeling of the power\r\nof evil inherent in her condition. Not only was she secluded from\r\nher family and the community, but an attempt was made to seclude the\r\nworld from her. One of the injunctions most strongly laid upon her\r\nwas not to look about her. She kept her head bowed and was forbidden\r\nto see the world and the sun. Some tribes covered her with a\r\nblanket. Many of the customs in this connection resembled those of\r\nthe North Pacific Coast most strongly, such as the prohibition to\r\nthe girl to touch or scratch her head with her hand, a special\r\nimplement being furnished her for the purpose. Sometimes she could\r\neat only when fed and in other cases fasted altogether."\r\n\r\nAmong the Chinook Indians who inhabited the coast of Washington\r\nState, when a chief\'s daughter attained to puberty, she was hidden\r\nfor five days from the view of the people; she might not look at\r\nthem nor at the sky, nor might she pick berries. It was believed\r\nthat if she were to look at the sky, the weather would be bad; that\r\nif she picked berries, it would rain; and that when she hung her\r\ntowel of cedar-bark on a spruce-tree, the tree withered up at once.\r\nShe went out of the house by a separate door and bathed in a creek\r\nfar from the village. She fasted for some days, and for many days\r\nmore she might not eat fresh food.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Aht or Nootka Indians of Vancouver Island, when girls\r\nreach puberty they are placed in a sort of gallery in the house "and\r\nare there surrounded completely with mats, so that neither the sun\r\nnor any fire can be seen. In this cage they remain for several days.\r\nWater is given them, but no food. The longer a girl remains in this\r\nretirement the greater honour is it to the parents; but she is\r\ndisgraced for life if it is known that she has seen fire or the sun\r\nduring this initiatory ordeal." Pictures of the mythical\r\nthunder-bird are painted on the screens behind which she hides.\r\nDuring her seclusion she may neither move nor lie down, but must\r\nalways sit in a squatting posture. She may not touch her hair with\r\nher hands, but is allowed to scratch her head with a comb or a piece\r\nof bone provided for the purpose. To scratch her body is also\r\nforbidden, as it is believed that every scratch would leave a scar.\r\nFor eight months after reaching maturity she may not eat any fresh\r\nfood, particularly salmon; moreover, she must eat by herself, and\r\nuse a cup and dish of her own.\r\n\r\nIn the Tsetsaut tribe of British Columbia a girl at puberty wears a\r\nlarge hat of skin which comes down over her face and screens it from\r\nthe sun. It is believed that if she were to expose her face to the\r\nsun or to the sky, rain would fall. The hat protects her face also\r\nagainst the fire, which ought not to strike her skin; to shield her\r\nhands she wears mittens. In her mouth she carries the tooth of an\r\nanimal to prevent her own teeth from becoming hollow. For a whole\r\nyear she may not see blood unless her face is blackened; otherwise\r\nshe would grow blind. For two years she wears the hat and lives in a\r\nhut by herself, although she is allowed to see other people. At the\r\nend of two years a man takes the hat from her head and throws it\r\naway. In the Bilqula or Bella Coola tribe of British Columbia, when\r\na girl attains puberty she must stay in the shed which serves as her\r\nbedroom, where she has a separate fireplace. She is not allowed to\r\ndescend to the main part of the house, and may not sit by the fire\r\nof the family. For four days she is bound to remain motionless in a\r\nsitting posture. She fasts during the day, but is allowed a little\r\nfood and drink very early in the morning. After the four days\'\r\nseclusion she may leave her room, but only through a separate\r\nopening cut in the floor, for the houses are raised on piles. She\r\nmay not yet come into the chief room. In leaving the house she wears\r\na large hat which protects her face against the rays of the sun. It\r\nis believed that if the sun were to shine on her face her eyes would\r\nsuffer. She may pick berries on the hills, but may not come near the\r\nriver or sea for a whole year. Were she to eat fresh salmon she\r\nwould lose her senses, or her mouth would be changed into a long\r\nbeak.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Tlingit (Thlinkeet) or Kolosh Indians of Alaska, when a\r\ngirl showed signs of womanhood she used to be confined to a little\r\nhut or cage, which was completely blocked up with the exception of a\r\nsmall air-hole. In this dark and filthy abode she had to remain a\r\nyear, without fire, exercise, or associates. Only her mother and a\r\nfemale slave might supply her with nourishment. Her food was put in\r\nat the little window; she had to drink out of the wing-bone of a\r\nwhite-headed eagle. The time of her seclusion was afterwards reduced\r\nin some places to six or three months or even less. She had to wear\r\na sort of hat with long flaps, that her gaze might not pollute the\r\nsky; for she was thought unfit for the sun to shine upon, and it was\r\nimagined that her look would destroy the luck of a hunter, fisher,\r\nor gambler, turn things to stone, and do other mischief. At the end\r\nof her confinement her old clothes were burnt, new ones were made,\r\nand a feast was given, at which a slit was cut in her under lip\r\nparallel to the mouth, and a piece of wood or shell was inserted to\r\nkeep the aperture open. Among the Koniags, an Esquimau people of\r\nAlaska, a girl at puberty was placed in a small hut in which she had\r\nto remain on her hands and feet for six months; then the hut was\r\nenlarged a little so as to allow her to straighten her back, but in\r\nthis posture she had to remain for six months more. All this time\r\nshe was regarded as an unclean being with whom no one might hold\r\nintercourse.\r\n\r\nWhen symptoms of puberty appeared on a girl for the first time, the\r\nGuaranis of Southern Brazil, on the borders of Paraguay, used to sew\r\nher up in her hammock, leaving only a small opening in it to allow\r\nher to breathe. In this condition, wrapt up and shrouded like a\r\ncorpse, she was kept for two or three days or so long as the\r\nsymptoms lasted, and during this time she had to observe a most\r\nrigorous fast. After that she was entrusted to a matron, who cut the\r\ngirl\'s hair and enjoined her to abstain most strictly from eating\r\nflesh of any kind until her hair should be grown long enough to hide\r\nher ears. In similar circumstances the Chiriguanos of South-eastern\r\nBolivia hoisted the girl in her hammock to the roof, where she\r\nstayed for a month: the second month the hammock was let half-way\r\ndown from the roof; and in the third month old women, armed with\r\nsticks, entered the hut and ran about striking everything they met,\r\nsaying they were hunting the snake that had wounded the girl.\r\n\r\nAmong the Matacos or Mataguayos, an Indian tribe of the Gran Chaco,\r\na girl at puberty has to remain in seclusion for some time. She lies\r\ncovered up with branches or other things in a corner of the hut,\r\nseeing no one and speaking to no one, and during this time she may\r\neat neither flesh nor fish. Meantime a man beats a drum in front of\r\nthe house. Among the Yuracares, an Indian tribe of Eastern Bolivia,\r\nwhen a girl perceives the signs of puberty, her father constructs a\r\nlittle hut of palm leaves near the house. In this cabin he shuts up\r\nhis daughter so that she cannot see the light, and there she remains\r\nfasting rigorously for four days.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Macusis of British Guiana, when a girl shows the first\r\nsigns of puberty, she is hung in a hammock at the highest point of\r\nthe hut. For the first few days she may not leave the hammock by\r\nday, but at night she must come down, light a fire, and spend the\r\nnight beside it, else she would break out in sores on her neck,\r\nthroat, and other parts of her body. So long as the symptoms are at\r\ntheir height, she must fast rigorously. When they have abated, she\r\nmay come down and take up her abode in a little compartment that is\r\nmade for her in the darkest corner of the hut. In the morning she\r\nmay cook her food, but it must be at a separate fire and in a vessel\r\nof her own. After about ten days the magician comes and undoes the\r\nspell by muttering charms and breathing on her and on the more\r\nvaluable of the things with which she has come in contact. The pots\r\nand drinking-vessels which she used are broken and the fragments\r\nburied. After her first bath, the girl must submit to be beaten by\r\nher mother with thin rods without uttering a cry. At the end of the\r\nsecond period she is again beaten, but not afterwards. She is now\r\n"clean," and can mix again with people. Other Indians of Guiana,\r\nafter keeping the girl in her hammock at the top of the hut for a\r\nmonth, expose her to certain large ants, whose bite is very painful.\r\nSometimes, in addition to being stung with ants, the sufferer has to\r\nfast day and night so long as she remains slung up on high in her\r\nhammock, so that when she comes down she is reduced to a skeleton.\r\n\r\nWhen a Hindoo maiden reaches maturity she is kept in a dark room for\r\nfour days, and is forbidden to see the sun. She is regarded as\r\nunclean; no one may touch her. Her diet is restricted to boiled\r\nrice, milk, sugar, curd, and tamarind without salt. On the morning\r\nof the fifth day she goes to a neighbouring tank, accompanied by\r\nfive women whose husbands are alive. Smeared with turmeric water,\r\nthey all bathe and return home, throwing away the mat and other\r\nthings that were in the room. The Rarhi Brahmans of Bengal compel a\r\ngirl at puberty to live alone, and do not allow her to see the face\r\nof any male. For three days she remains shut up in a dark room, and\r\nhas to undergo certain penances. Fish, flesh, and sweetmeats are\r\nforbidden her; she must live upon rice and ghee. Among the Tiyans of\r\nMalabar a girl is thought to be polluted for four days from the\r\nbeginning of her first menstruation. During this time she must keep\r\nto the north side of the house, where she sleeps on a grass mat of a\r\nparticular kind, in a room festooned with garlands of young coco-nut\r\nleaves. Another girl keeps her company and sleeps with her, but she\r\nmay not touch any other person, tree or plant. Further, she may not\r\nsee the sky, and woe betide her if she catches sight of a crow or a\r\ncat! Her diet must be strictly vegetarian, without salt, tamarinds,\r\nor chillies. She is armed against evil spirits by a knife, which is\r\nplaced on the mat or carried on her person.\r\n\r\nIn Cambodia a girl at puberty is put to bed under a mosquito\r\ncurtain, where she should stay a hundred days. Usually, however,\r\nfour, five, ten, or twenty days are thought enough; and even this,\r\nin a hot climate and under the close meshes of the curtain, is\r\nsufficiently trying. According to another account, a Cambodian\r\nmaiden at puberty is said to "enter into the shade." During her\r\nretirement, which, according to the rank and position of her family,\r\nmay last any time from a few days to several years, she has to\r\nobserve a number of rules, such as not to be seen by a strange man,\r\nnot to eat flesh or fish, and so on. She goes nowhere, not even to\r\nthe pagoda. But this state of seclusion is discontinued during\r\neclipses; at such times she goes forth and pays her devotions to the\r\nmonster who is supposed to cause eclipses by catching the heavenly\r\nbodies between his teeth. This permission to break her rule of\r\nretirement and appear abroad during an eclipse seems to show how\r\nliterally the injunction is interpreted which forbids maidens\r\nentering on womanhood to look upon the sun.\r\n\r\nA superstition so widely diffused as this might be expected to leave\r\ntraces in legends and folk-tales. And it has done so. The old Greek\r\nstory of Danae, who was confined by her father in a subterranean\r\nchamber or a brazen tower, but impregnated by Zeus, who reached her\r\nin the shape of a shower of gold, perhaps belongs to this class of\r\ntales. It has its counterpart in the legend which the Kirghiz of\r\nSiberia tell of their ancestry. A certain Khan had a fair daughter,\r\nwhom he kept in a dark iron house, that no man might see her. An old\r\nwoman tended her; and when the girl was grown to maidenhood she\r\nasked the old woman, "Where do you go so often?" "My child," said\r\nthe old dame, "there is a bright world. In that bright world your\r\nfather and mother live, and all sorts of people live there. That is\r\nwhere I go." The maiden said, "Good mother, I will tell nobody, but\r\nshow me that bright world." So the old woman took the girl out of\r\nthe iron house. But when she saw the bright world, the girl tottered\r\nand fainted; and the eye of God fell upon her, and she conceived.\r\nHer angry father put her in a golden chest and sent her floating\r\naway (fairy gold can float in fairyland) over the wide sea. The\r\nshower of gold in the Greek story, and the eye of God in the Kirghiz\r\nlegend, probably stand for sunlight and the sun. The idea that women\r\nmay be impregnated by the sun is not uncommon in legends, and there\r\nare even traces of it in marriage customs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Reasons for the Seclusion of Girls at Puberty\r\n\r\nTHE MOTIVE for the restraints so commonly imposed on girls at\r\npuberty is the deeply engrained dread which primitive man\r\nuniversally entertains of menstruous blood. He fears it at all times\r\nbut especially on its first appearance; hence the restrictions under\r\nwhich women lie at their first menstruation are usually more\r\nstringent than those which they have to observe at any subsequent\r\nrecurrence of the mysterious flow. Some evidence of the fear and of\r\nthe customs based on it has been cited in an earlier part of this\r\nwork; but as the terror, for it is nothing less, which the\r\nphenomenon periodically strikes into the mind of the savage has\r\ndeeply influenced his life and institutions, it may be well to\r\nillustrate the subject with some further examples.\r\n\r\nThus in the Encounter Bay tribe of South Australia there is, or used\r\nto be, a "superstition which obliges a woman to separate herself\r\nfrom the camp at the time of her monthly illness, when if a young\r\nman or boy should approach, she calls out, and he immediately makes\r\na circuit to avoid her. If she is neglectful upon this point, she\r\nexposes herself to scolding, and sometimes to severe beating by her\r\nhusband or nearest relation, because the boys are told from their\r\ninfancy, that if they see the blood they will early become\r\ngrey-headed, and their strength will fail prematurely." The Dieri of\r\nCentral Australia believe that if women at these times were to eat\r\nfish or bathe in a river, the fish would all die and the water would\r\ndry up. The Arunta of the same region forbid menstruous women to\r\ngather the _irriakura_ bulbs, which form a staple article of diet\r\nfor both men and women. They think that were a woman to break this\r\nrule, the supply of bulbs would fail.\r\n\r\nIn some Australian tribes the seclusion of menstruous women was even\r\nmore rigid, and was enforced by severer penalties than a scolding or\r\na beating. Thus "there is a regulation relating to camps in the\r\nWakelbura tribe which forbids the women coming into the encampment\r\nby the same path as the men. Any violation of this rule would in a\r\nlarge camp be punished with death. The reason for this is the dread\r\nwith which they regard the menstrual period of women. During such a\r\ntime, a woman is kept entirely away from the camp, half a mile at\r\nleast. A woman in such a condition has boughs of some tree of her\r\ntotem tied round her loins, and is constantly watched and guarded,\r\nfor it is thought that should any male be so unfortunate as to see a\r\nwoman in such a condition, he would die. If such a woman were to let\r\nherself be seen by a man, she would probably be put to death. When\r\nthe woman has recovered, she is painted red and white, her head\r\ncovered with feathers, and returns to the camp."\r\n\r\nIn Muralug, one of the Torres Straits Islands, a menstruous woman\r\nmay not eat anything that lives in the sea, else the natives believe\r\nthat the fisheries would fail. In Galela, to the west of New Guinea,\r\nwomen at their monthly periods may not enter a tobacco-field, or the\r\nplants would be attacked by disease. The Minangkabauers of Sumatra\r\nare persuaded that if a woman in her unclean state were to go near a\r\nrice-field, the crop would be spoiled.\r\n\r\nThe Bushmen of South Africa think that, by a glance of a girl\'s eye\r\nat the time when she ought to be kept in strict retirement, men\r\nbecome fixed in whatever positions they happen to occupy, with\r\nwhatever they were holding in their hands, and are changed into\r\ntrees that talk. Cattle-rearing tribes of South Africa hold that\r\ntheir cattle would die if the milk were drunk by a menstruous woman;\r\nand they fear the same disaster if a drop of her blood were to fall\r\non the ground and the oxen were to pass over it. To prevent such a\r\ncalamity women in general, not menstruous women only, are forbidden\r\nto enter the cattle enclosure; and more than that, they may not use\r\nthe ordinary paths in entering the village or in passing from one\r\nhut to another. They are obliged to make circuitous tracks at the\r\nback of the huts in order to avoid the ground in the middle of the\r\nvillage where the cattle stand or lie down. These women\'s tracks may\r\nbe seen at every Caffre village. Among the Baganda, in like manner,\r\nno menstruous woman might drink milk or come into contact with any\r\nmilk-vessel; and she might not touch anything that belonged to her\r\nhusband, nor sit on his mat, nor cook his food. If she touched\r\nanything of his at such a time it was deemed equivalent to wishing\r\nhim dead or to actually working magic for his destruction. Were she\r\nto handle any article of his, he would surely fall ill; were she to\r\ntouch his weapons, he would certainly be killed in the next battle.\r\nFurther, the Baganda would not suffer a menstruous woman to visit a\r\nwell; if she did so, they feared that the water would dry up, and\r\nthat she herself would fall sick and die, unless she confessed her\r\nfault and the medicine-man made atonement for her. Among the Akikuyu\r\nof British East Africa, if a new hut is built in a village and the\r\nwife chances to menstruate in it on the day she lights the first\r\nfire there, the hut must be broken down and demolished the very next\r\nday. The woman may on no account sleep a second night in it; there\r\nis a curse both on her and on it.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Talmud, if a woman at the beginning of her period\r\npasses between two men, she thereby kills one of them. Peasants of\r\nthe Lebanon think that menstruous women are the cause or many\r\nmisfortunes; their shadow causes flowers to wither and trees to\r\nperish, it even arrests the movements of serpents; if one of them\r\nmounts a horse, the animal might die or at least be disabled for a\r\nlong time.\r\n\r\nThe Guayquiries of the Orinoco believe that when a woman has her\r\ncourses, everything upon which she steps will die, and that if a man\r\ntreads on the place where she has passed, his legs will immediately\r\nswell up. Among the Bri-bri Indians of Costa Rica a married woman at\r\nher periods uses for plates only banana leaves, which, when she has\r\ndone with them, she throws away in a sequestered spot; for should a\r\ncow find and eat them, the animal would waste away and perish. Also\r\nshe drinks only out of a special vessel, because any person who\r\nshould afterwards drink out of the same vessel would infallibly pine\r\naway and die.\r\n\r\nAmong most tribes of North American Indians the custom was that\r\nwomen in their courses retired from the camp or the village and\r\nlived during the time of their uncleanness in special huts or\r\nshelters which were appropriated to their use. There they dwelt\r\napart, eating and sleeping by themselves, warming themselves at\r\ntheir own fires, and strictly abstaining from all communications\r\nwith men, who shunned them just as if they were stricken with the\r\nplague.\r\n\r\nThus, to take examples, the Creek and kindred Indians of the United\r\nStates compelled women at menstruation to live in separate huts at\r\nsome distance from the village. There the women had to stay, at the\r\nrisk of being surprised and cut off by enemies. It was thought "a\r\nmost horrid and dangerous pollution" to go near the women at such\r\ntimes; and the danger extended to enemies who, if they slew the\r\nwomen, had to cleanse themselves from the pollution by means of\r\ncertain sacred herbs and roots. The Stseelis Indians of British\r\nColumbia imagined that if a menstruous woman were to step over a\r\nbundle of arrows, the arrows would thereby be rendered useless and\r\nmight even cause the death of their owner; and similarly that if she\r\npassed in front of a hunter who carried a gun, the weapon would\r\nnever shoot straight again. Among the Chippeways and other Indians\r\nof the Hudson Bay Territory, menstruous women are excluded from the\r\ncamp, and take up their abode in huts of branches. They wear long\r\nhoods, which effectually conceal the head and breast. They may not\r\ntouch the household furniture nor any objects used by men; for their\r\ntouch "is supposed to defile them, so that their subsequent use\r\nwould be followed by certain mischief or misfortune," such as\r\ndisease or death. They must drink out of a swan\'s bone. They may not\r\nwalk on the common paths nor cross the tracks of animals. They "are\r\nnever permitted to walk on the ice of rivers or lakes, or near the\r\npart where the men are hunting beaver, or where a fishing-net is\r\nset, for fear of averting their success. They are also prohibited at\r\nthose times from partaking of the head of any animal, and even from\r\nwalking in or crossing the track where the head of a deer, moose,\r\nbeaver, and many other animals have lately been carried, either on a\r\nsledge or on the back. To be guilty of a violation of this custom is\r\nconsidered as of the greatest importance; because they firmly\r\nbelieve that it would be a means of preventing the hunter from\r\nhaving an equal success in his future excursions." So the Lapps\r\nforbid women at menstruation to walk on that part of the shore where\r\nthe fishers are in the habit of setting out their fish; and the\r\nEsquimaux of Bering Strait believe that if hunters were to come near\r\nwomen in their courses they would catch no game. For a like reason\r\nthe Carrier Indians will not suffer a menstruous woman to cross the\r\ntracks of animals; if need be, she is carried over them. They think\r\nthat if she waded in a stream or a lake, the fish would die.\r\n\r\nAmongst the civilised nations of Europe the superstitions which\r\ncluster round this mysterious aspect of woman\'s nature are not less\r\nextravagant than those which prevail among savages. In the oldest\r\nexisting cyclopaedia--the _Natural History_ of Pliny--the list of\r\ndangers apprehended from menstruation is longer than any furnished\r\nby mere barbarians. According to Pliny, the touch of a menstruous\r\nwoman turned wine to vinegar, blighted crops, killed seedlings,\r\nblasted gardens, brought down the fruit from trees, dimmed mirrors,\r\nblunted razors, rusted iron and brass (especially at the waning of\r\nthe moon), killed bees, or at least drove them from their hives,\r\ncaused mares to miscarry, and so forth. Similarly, in various parts\r\nof Europe, it is still believed that if a woman in her courses\r\nenters a brewery the beer will turn sour; if she touches beer, wine,\r\nvinegar, or milk, it will go bad; if she makes jam, it will not\r\nkeep; if she mounts a mare, it will miscarry; if she touches buds,\r\nthey will wither; if she climbs a cherry tree, it will die. In\r\nBrunswick people think that if a menstruous woman assists at the\r\nkilling of a pig, the pork will putrefy. In the Greek island of\r\nCalymnos a woman at such times may not go to the well to draw water,\r\nnor cross a running stream, nor enter the sea. Her presence in a\r\nboat is said to raise storms.\r\n\r\nThus the object of secluding women at menstruation is to neutralise\r\nthe dangerous influences which are supposed to emanate from them at\r\nsuch times. That the danger is believed to be especially great at\r\nthe first menstruation appears from the unusual precautions taken to\r\nisolate girls at this crisis. Two of these precautions have been\r\nillustrated above, namely, the rules that the girls may not touch\r\nthe ground nor see the sun. The general effect of these rules is to\r\nkeep her suspended, so to say, between heaven and earth. Whether\r\nenveloped in her hammock and slung up to the roof, as in South\r\nAmerica, or raised above the ground in a dark and narrow cage, as in\r\nNew Ireland, she may be considered to be out of the way of doing\r\nmischief, since, being shut off both from the earth and from the\r\nsun, she can poison neither of these great sources of life by her\r\ndeadly contagion. In short, she is rendered harmless by being, in\r\nelectrical language, insulated. But the precautions thus taken to\r\nisolate or insulate the girl are dictated by a regard for her own\r\nsafety as well as for the safety of others. For it is thought that\r\nshe herself would suffer if she were to neglect the prescribed\r\nregimen. Thus Zulu girls, as we have seen, believe that they would\r\nshrivel to skeletons if the sun were to shine on them at puberty,\r\nand the Macusis imagine that, if a young woman were to transgress\r\nthe rules, she would suffer from sores on various parts of her body.\r\nIn short, the girl is viewed as charged with a powerful force which,\r\nif not kept within bounds, may prove destructive both to herself and\r\nto all with whom she comes in contact. To repress this force within\r\nthe limits necessary for the safety of all concerned is the object\r\nof the taboos in question.\r\n\r\nThe same explanation applies to the observance of the same rules by\r\ndivine kings and priests. The uncleanness, as it is called, of girls\r\nat puberty and the sanctity of holy men do not, to the primitive\r\nmind, differ materially from each other. They are only different\r\nmanifestations of the same mysterious energy which, like energy in\r\ngeneral, is in itself neither good nor bad, but becomes beneficent\r\nor maleficent according to its application. Accordingly, if, like\r\ngirls at puberty, divine personages may neither touch the ground nor\r\nsee the sun, the reason is, on the one hand, a fear lest their\r\ndivinity might, at contact with earth or heaven, discharge itself\r\nwith fatal violence on either; and, on the other hand, an\r\napprehension that the divine being, thus drained of his ethereal\r\nvirtue, might thereby be incapacitated for the future performance of\r\nthose magical functions, upon the proper discharge of which the\r\nsafety of the people and even of the world is believed to hang. Thus\r\nthe rules in question fall under the head of the taboos which we\r\nexamined in an earlier part of this book; they are intended to\r\npreserve the life of the divine person and with it the life of his\r\nsubjects and worshippers. Nowhere, it is thought, can his precious\r\nyet dangerous life be at once so safe and so harmless as when it is\r\nneither in heaven nor in earth, but, as far as possible, suspended\r\nbetween the two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXI. The Myth of Balder\r\n\r\nA DEITY whose life might in a sense be said to be neither in heaven\r\nnor on earth but between the two, was the Norse Balder, the good and\r\nbeautiful god, the son of the great god Odin, and himself the\r\nwisest, mildest, best beloved of all the immortals. The story of his\r\ndeath, as it is told in the younger or prose _Edda,_ runs thus. Once\r\non a time Balder dreamed heavy dreams which seemed to forebode his\r\ndeath. Thereupon the gods held a council and resolved to make him\r\nsecure against every danger. So the goddess Frigg took an oath from\r\nfire and water, iron and all metals, stones and earth, from trees,\r\nsicknesses and poisons, and from all four-footed beasts, birds, and\r\ncreeping things, that they would not hurt Balder. When this was done\r\nBalder was deemed invulnerable; so the gods amused themselves by\r\nsetting him in their midst, while some shot at him, others hewed at\r\nhim, and others threw stones at him. But whatever they did, nothing\r\ncould hurt him; and at this they were all glad. Only Loki, the\r\nmischief-maker, was displeased, and he went in the guise of an old\r\nwoman to Frigg, who told him that the weapons of the gods could not\r\nwound Balder, since she had made them all swear not to hurt him.\r\nThen Loki asked, "Have all things sworn to spare Balder?" She\r\nanswered, "East of Walhalla grows a plant called mistletoe; it\r\nseemed to me too young to swear." So Loki went and pulled the\r\nmistletoe and took it to the assembly of the gods. There he found\r\nthe blind god Hother standing at the outside of the circle. Loki\r\nasked him, "Why do you not shoot at Balder?" Hother answered,\r\n"Because I do not see where he stands; besides I have no weapon."\r\nThen said Loki, "Do like the rest and show Balder honour, as they\r\nall do. I will show you where he stands, and do you shoot at him\r\nwith this twig." Hother took the mistletoe and threw it at Balder,\r\nas Loki directed him. The mistletoe struck Balder and pierced him\r\nthrough and through, and he fell down dead. And that was the\r\ngreatest misfortune that ever befell gods and men. For a while the\r\ngods stood speechless, then they lifted up their voices and wept\r\nbitterly. They took Balder\'s body and brought it to the sea-shore.\r\nThere stood Balder\'s ship; it was called Ringhorn, and was the\r\nhugest of all ships. The gods wished to launch the ship and to burn\r\nBalder\'s body on it, but the ship would not stir. So they sent for a\r\ngiantess called Hyrrockin. She came riding on a wolf and gave the\r\nship such a push that fire flashed from the rollers and all the\r\nearth shook. Then Balder\'s body was taken and placed on the funeral\r\npile upon his ship. When his wife Nanna saw that, her heart burst\r\nfor sorrow and she died. So she was laid on the funeral pile with\r\nher husband, and fire was put to it. Balder\'s horse, too, with all\r\nits trappings, was burned on the pile.\r\n\r\nWhether he was a real or merely a mythical personage, Balder was\r\nworshipped in Norway. On one of the bays of the beautiful Sogne\r\nFiord, which penetrates far into the depths of the solemn Norwegian\r\nmountains, with their sombre pine-forests and their lofty cascades\r\ndissolving into spray before they reach the dark water of the fiord\r\nfar below, Balder had a great sanctuary. It was called Balder\'s\r\nGrove. A palisade enclosed the hallowed ground, and within it stood\r\na spacious temple with the images of many gods, but none of them was\r\nworshipped with such devotion as Balder. So great was the awe with\r\nwhich the heathen regarded the place that no man might harm another\r\nthere, nor steal his cattle, nor defile himself with women. But\r\nwomen cared for the images of the gods in the temple; they warmed\r\nthem at the fire, anointed them with oil, and dried them with\r\ncloths.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of an historical kernel underlying a\r\nmythical husk in the legend of Balder, the details of the story\r\nsuggest that it belongs to that class of myths which have been\r\ndramatised an ritual, or, to put it otherwise, which have been\r\nperformed as magical ceremonies for the sake of producing those\r\nnatural effects which they describe in figurative language. A myth\r\nis never so graphic and precise in its details as when it is, so to\r\nspeak, the book of the words which are spoken and acted by the\r\nperformers of the sacred rite. That the Norse story of Balder was a\r\nmyth of this sort will become probable if we can prove that\r\nceremonies resembling the incidents in the tale have been performed\r\nby Norsemen and other European peoples. Now the main incidents in\r\nthe tale are two--first, the pulling of the mistletoe, and second,\r\nthe death and burning of the god; and both of them may perhaps be\r\nfound to have had their counterparts in yearly rites observed,\r\nwhether separately or conjointly, by people in various parts of\r\nEurope. These rites will be described and discussed in the following\r\nchapters. We shall begin with the annual festivals of fire and shall\r\nreserve the pulling of the mistletoe for consideration later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXII. The Fire-Festivals of Europe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Fire-festivals in general\r\n\r\nALL over Europe the peasants have been accustomed from time\r\nimmemorial to kindle bonfires on certain days of the year, and to\r\ndance round or leap over them. Customs of this kind can be traced\r\nback on historical evidence to the Middle Ages, and their analogy to\r\nsimilar customs observed in antiquity goes with strong internal\r\nevidence to prove that their origin must be sought in a period long\r\nprior to the spread of Christianity. Indeed the earliest proof of\r\ntheir observance in Northern Europe is furnished by the attempts\r\nmade by Christian synods in the eighth century to put them down as\r\nheathenish rites. Not uncommonly effigies are burned in these fires,\r\nor a pretence is made of burning a living person in them; and there\r\nare grounds for believing that anciently human beings were actually\r\nburned on these occasions. A brief view of the customs in question\r\nwill bring out the traces of human sacrifice, and will serve at the\r\nsame time to throw light on their meaning.\r\n\r\nThe seasons of the year when these bonfires are most commonly lit\r\nare spring and midsummer; but in some places they are kindled also\r\nat the end of autumn or during the course of the winter,\r\nparticularly on Hallow E\'en (the thirty-first of October), Christmas\r\nDay, and the Eve of Twelfth Day. Space forbids me to describe all\r\nthese festivals at length; a few specimens must serve to illustrate\r\ntheir general character. We shall begin with the fire-festivals of\r\nspring, which usually fall on the first Sunday of Lent\r\n(_Quadragesima_ or _Invocavit_), Easter Eve, and May Day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Lenten Fires\r\n\r\nTHE CUSTOM of kindling bonfires on the first Sunday in Lent has\r\nprevailed in Belgium, the north of France, and many parts of\r\nGermany. Thus in the Belgian Ardennes for a week or a fortnight\r\nbefore the "day of the great fire," as it is called, children go\r\nabout from farm to farm collecting fuel. At Grand Halleux any one\r\nwho refuses their request is pursued next day by the children, who\r\ntry to blacken his face with the ashes of the extinct fire. When the\r\nday has come, they cut down bushes, especially juniper and broom,\r\nand in the evening great bonfires blaze on all the heights. It is a\r\ncommon saying that seven bonfires should be seen if the village is\r\nto be safe from conflagrations. If the Meuse happens to be frozen\r\nhard at the time, bonfires are lit also on the ice. At Grand Halleux\r\nthey set up a pole called _makral,_ or "the witch," in the midst of\r\nthe pile, and the fire is kindled by the man who was last married in\r\nthe village. In the neighbourhood of Morlanwelz a straw man is burnt\r\nin the fire. Young people and children dance and sing round the\r\nbonfires, and leap over the embers to secure good crops or a happy\r\nmarriage within the year, or as a means of guarding themselves\r\nagainst colic. In Brabant on the same Sunday, down to the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century, women and men disguised in female attire\r\nused to go with burning torches to the fields, where they danced and\r\nsang comic songs for the purpose, as they alleged, of driving away\r\n"the wicked sower," who is mentioned in the Gospel for the day. At\r\nP\xe2turages, in the province of Hainaut, down to about 1840 the custom\r\nwas observed under the name of _Escouvion_ or _Scouvion._ Every year\r\non the first Sunday of Lent, which was called the Day of the Little\r\nScouvion, young folks and children used to run with lighted torches\r\nthrough the gardens and orchards. As they ran they cried at the\r\npitch of their voices:\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Bear apples, bear pears, and cherries all black\r\n     To Scouvion!"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt these words the torch-bearer whirled his blazing brand and hurled\r\nit among the branches of the apple-trees, the pear-trees, and the\r\ncherry-trees. The next Sunday was called the Day of the Great\r\nScouvion, and the same race with lighted torches among the trees of\r\nthe orchards was repeated in the afternoon till darkness fell.\r\n\r\nIn the French department of the Ardennes the whole village used to\r\ndance and sing around the bonfires which were lighted on the first\r\nSunday in Lent. Here, too, it was the person last married, sometimes\r\na man and sometimes a woman, who put the match to the fire. The\r\ncustom is still kept up very commonly in the district. Cats used to\r\nbe burnt in the fire or roasted to death by being held over it; and\r\nwhile they were burning the shepherds drove their flocks through the\r\nsmoke and flames as a sure means of guarding them against sickness\r\nand witchcraft. In some communes it was believed that the livelier\r\nthe dance round the fire, the better would be the crops that year.\r\n\r\nIn the French province of Franche-Comt\xe9, to the west of the Jura\r\nMountains, the first Sunday of Lent is known as the Sunday of the\r\nFirebrands (_Brandons_), on account of the fires which it is\r\ncustomary to kindle on that day. On the Saturday or the Sunday the\r\nvillage lads harness themselves to a cart and drag it about the\r\nstreets, stopping at the doors of the houses where there are girls\r\nand begging fora faggot. When they have got enough, they cart the\r\nfuel to a spot at some little distance from the village, pile it up,\r\nand set it on fire. All the people of the parish come out to see the\r\nbonfire. In some villages, when the bells have rung the Angelus, the\r\nsignal for the observance is given by cries of, "To the fire! to the\r\nfire!" Lads, lasses, and children dance round the blaze, and when\r\nthe flames have died down they vie with each other in leaping over\r\nthe red embers. He or she who does so without singeing his or her\r\ngarments will be married within the year. Young folk also carry\r\nlighted torches about the streets or the fields, and when they pass\r\nan orchard they cry out, "More fruit than leaves!" Down to recent\r\nyears at Laviron, in the department of Doubs, it was the young\r\nmarried couples of the year who had charge of the bonfires. In the\r\nmidst of the bonfire a pole was planted with a wooden figure of a\r\ncock fastened to the top. Then there were races, and the winner\r\nreceived the cock as a prize.\r\n\r\nIn Auvergne fires are everywhere kindled on the evening of the first\r\nSunday in Lent. Every village, every hamlet, even every ward, every\r\nisolated farm has its bonfire or _figo,_ as it is called, which\r\nblazes up as the shades of night are falling. The fires may be seen\r\nflaring on the heights and in the plains; the people dance and sing\r\nround about them and leap through the flames. Then they proceed to\r\nthe ceremony of the _Grannas-mias._ A _granno-mio_ is a torch of\r\nstraw fastened to the top of a pole. When the pyre is half consumed,\r\nthe bystanders kindle the torches at the expiring flames and carry\r\nthem into the neighbouring orchards, fields, and gardens, wherever\r\nthere are fruit-trees. As they march they sing at the top of their\r\nvoices, "Granno my friend, Granno my father, Granno my mother." Then\r\nthey pass the burning torches under the branches of every tree,\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\n\r\n"_Brando, brandounci tsaque brantso, in plan panei!_"\r\n\r\n\r\nthat is, "Firebrand burn; every branch a basketful!" In some\r\nvillages the people also run across the sown fields and shake the\r\nashes of the torches on the ground; also they put some of the ashes\r\nin the fowls\' nests, in order that the hens may lay plenty of eggs\r\nthroughout the year. When all these ceremonies have been performed,\r\neverybody goes home and feasts; the special dishes of the evening\r\nare fritters and pancakes. Here the application of the fire to the\r\nfruit-trees, to the sown fields, and to the nests of the poultry is\r\nclearly a charm intended to ensure fertility; and the Granno to whom\r\nthe invocations are addressed, and who gives his name to the\r\ntorches, may possibly be, as Dr. Pommerol suggests, no other than\r\nthe ancient Celtic god Grannus, whom the Romans identified with\r\nApollo, and whose worship is attested by inscriptions found not only\r\nin France but in Scotland and on the Danube.\r\n\r\nThe custom of carrying lighted torches of straw (_brandons_) about\r\nthe orchards and fields to fertilise them on the first Sunday of\r\nLent seems to have been common in France, whether it was accompanied\r\nwith the practice of kindling bonfires or not. Thus in the province\r\nof Picardy "on the first Sunday of Lent people carried torches\r\nthrough the fields, exorcising the field-mice, the darnel, and the\r\nsmut. They imagined that they did much good to the gardens and\r\ncaused the onions to grow large. Children ran about the fields,\r\ntorch in hand, to make the land more fertile." At Verges, a village\r\nbetween the Jura and the Combe d\'Ain, the torches at this season\r\nwere kindled on the top of a mountain, and the bearers went to every\r\nhouse in the village, demanding roasted peas and obliging all\r\ncouples who had been married within the year to dance. In Berry, a\r\ndistrict of Central France, it appears that bonfires are not lighted\r\non this day, but when the sun has set the whole population of the\r\nvillages, armed with blazing torches of straw, disperse over the\r\ncountry and scour the fields, the vineyards, and the orchards. Seen\r\nfrom afar, the multitude of moving lights, twinkling in the\r\ndarkness, appear like will-o\'-the-wisps chasing each other across\r\nthe plains, along the hillsides, and down the valleys. While the men\r\nwave their flambeaus about the branches of the fruit-trees, the\r\nwomen and children tie bands of wheaten-straw round the tree-trunks.\r\nThe effect of the ceremony is supposed to be to avert the various\r\nplagues from which the fruits of the earth are apt to suffer; and\r\nthe bands of straw fastened round the stems of the trees are\r\nbelieved to render them fruitful.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, Austria, and Switzerland at the same season similar\r\ncustoms have prevailed. Thus in the Eifel Mountains, Rhenish\r\nPrussia, on the first Sunday in Lent young people used to collect\r\nstraw and brushwood from house to house. These they carried to an\r\neminence and piled up round a tall, slim beech-tree, to which a\r\npiece of wood was fastened at right angles to form a cross. The\r\nstructure was known as the "hut" or "castle." Fire was set to it and\r\nthe young people marched round the blazing "castle" bareheaded, each\r\ncarrying a lighted torch and praying aloud. Sometimes a straw-man\r\nwas burned in the "hut." People observed the direction in which the\r\nsmoke blew from the fire. If it blew towards the corn-fields, it was\r\na sign that the harvest would be abundant. On the same day, in some\r\nparts of the Eifel, a great wheel was made of straw and dragged by\r\nthree horses to the top of the hill. Thither the village boys\r\nmarched at nightfall, set fire to the wheel, and sent it rolling\r\ndown the slope. At Oberstattfeld the wheel had to be provided by the\r\nyoung man who was last married. About Echternach in Luxemburg the\r\nsame ceremony is called "burning the witch." At Voralberg in the\r\nTyrol, on the first Sunday in Lent, a slender young fir-tree is\r\nsurrounded with a pile of straw and firewood. To the top of the tree\r\nis fastened a human figure called the "witch," made of old clothes\r\nand stuffed with gunpowder. At night the whole is set on fire and\r\nboys and girls dance round it, swinging torches and singing rhymes\r\nin which the words "corn in the winnowing-basket, the plough in the\r\nearth" may be distinguished. In Swabia on the first Sunday in Lent a\r\nfigure called the "witch" or the "old wife" or "winter\'s\r\ngrandmother" is made up of clothes and fastened to a pole. This is\r\nstuck in the middle of a pile of wood, to which fire is applied.\r\nWhile the "witch" is burning, the young people throw blazing discs\r\ninto the air. The discs are thin round pieces of wood, a few inches\r\nin diameter, with notched edges to imitate the rays of the sun or\r\nstars. They have a hole in the middle, by which they are attached to\r\nthe end of a wand. Before the disc is thrown it is set on fire, the\r\nwand is swung to and fro, and the impetus thus communicated to the\r\ndisc is augmented by dashing the rod sharply against a sloping\r\nboard. The burning disc is thus thrown off, and mounting high into\r\nthe air, describes a long fiery curve before it reaches the ground.\r\nThe charred embers of the burned "witch" and discs are taken home\r\nand planted in the flax-fields the same night, in the belief that\r\nthey will keep vermin from the fields. In the Rh\xf6n Mountains,\r\nsituated on the borders of Hesse and Bavaria, the people used to\r\nmarch to the top of a hill or eminence on the first Sunday in Lent.\r\nChildren and lads carried torches, brooms daubed with tar, and poles\r\nswathed in straw. A wheel, wrapt in combustibles, was kindled and\r\nrolled down the hill; and the young people rushed about the fields\r\nwith their burning torches and brooms, till at last they flung them\r\nin a heap, and standing round them, struck up a hymn or a popular\r\nsong. The object of running about the fields with the blazing\r\ntorches was to "drive away the wicked sower." Or it was done in\r\nhonour of the Virgin, that she might preserve the fruits of the\r\nearth throughout the year and bless them. In neighbouring villages\r\nof Hesse, between the Rh\xf6n and the Vogel Mountains, it is thought\r\nthat wherever the burning wheels roll, the fields will be safe from\r\nhail and strom.\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland, also, it is or used to be customary to kindle\r\nbonfires on high places on the evening of the first Sunday in Lent,\r\nand the day is therefore popularly known as Spark Sunday. The custom\r\nprevailed, for example, throughout the canton of Lucerne. Boys went\r\nabout from house to house begging for wood and straw, then piled the\r\nfuel on a conspicuous mountain or hill round about a pole, which\r\nbore a straw effigy called "the witch." At nightfall the pile was\r\nset on fire, and the young folks danced wildly round it, some of\r\nthem cracking whips or ringing bells; and when the fire burned low\r\nenough, they leaped over it. This was called "burning the witch." In\r\nsome parts of the canton also they used to wrap old wheels in straw\r\nand thorns, put a light to them, and send them rolling and blazing\r\ndown hill. The more bonfires could be seen sparkling and flaring in\r\nthe darkness, the more fruitful was the year expected to be; and the\r\nhigher the dancers leaped beside or over the fire, the higher, it\r\nwas thought, would grow the flax. In some districts it was the last\r\nmarried man or woman who must kindle the bonfire.\r\n\r\nIt seems hardly possible to separate from these bonfires, kindled on\r\nthe first Sunday in Lent, the fires in which, about the same season,\r\nthe effigy called Death is burned as part of the ceremony of\r\n"carrying out Death." We have seen that at Spachendorf, in Austrian\r\nSilesia, on the morning of Rupert\'s Day (Shrove Tuesday?), a\r\nstraw-man, dressed in a fur coat and a fur cap, is laid in a hole\r\noutside the village and there burned, and that while it is blazing\r\nevery one seeks to snatch a fragment of it, which he fastens to a\r\nbranch of the highest tree in his garden or buries in his field,\r\nbelieving that this will make the crops to grow better. The ceremony\r\nis known as the "burying of Death." Even when the straw-man is not\r\ndesignated as Death, the meaning of the observance is probably the\r\nsame; for the name Death, as I have tried to show, does not express\r\nthe original intention of the ceremony. At Cobern in the Eifel\r\nMountains the lads make up a straw-man on Shrove Tuesday. The effigy\r\nis formally tried and accused of having perpetrated all the thefts\r\nthat have been committed in the neighbourhood throughout the year.\r\nBeing condemned to death, the straw-man is led through the village,\r\nshot, and burned upon a pyre. They dance round the blazing pile, and\r\nthe last bride must leap over it. In Oldenburg on the evening of\r\nShrove Tuesday people used to make long bundles of straw, which they\r\nset on fire, and then ran about the fields waving them, shrieking,\r\nand singing wild songs. Finally they burned a straw-man on the\r\nfield. In the district of D\xfcsseldorf the straw-man burned on Shrove\r\nTuesday was made of an unthreshed sheaf of corn. On the first Monday\r\nafter the spring equinox the urchins of Zurich drag a straw-man on a\r\nlittle cart through the streets, while at the same time the girls\r\ncarry about a May-tree. When vespers ring, the straw-man is burned.\r\nIn the district of Aachen on Ash Wednesday, a man used to be encased\r\nin peas-straw and taken to an appointed place. Here he slipped\r\nquietly out of his straw casing, which was then burned, the children\r\nthinking that it was the man who was being burned. In the Val di\r\nLedro (Tyrol) on the last day of the Carnival a figure is made up of\r\nstraw and brushwood and then burned. The figure is called the Old\r\nWoman, and the ceremony "burning the Old Woman."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The Easter Fires\r\n\r\nANOTHER occasion on which these fire-festivals are held is Easter\r\nEve, the Saturday before Easter Sunday. On that day it has been\r\ncustomary in Catholic countries to extinguish all the lights in the\r\nchurches, and then to make a new fire, sometimes with flint and\r\nsteel, sometimes with a burning-glass. At this fire is lit the great\r\nPaschal or Easter candle, which is then used to rekindle all the\r\nextinguished lights in the church. In many parts of Germany a\r\nbonfire is also kindled, by means of the new fire, on some open\r\nspace near the church. It is consecrated, and the people bring\r\nsticks of oak, walnut, and beech, which they char in the fire, and\r\nthen take home with them. Some of these charred sticks are thereupon\r\nburned at home in a newly-kindled fire, with a prayer that God will\r\npreserve the homestead from fire, lightning, and hail. Thus every\r\nhouse receives "new fire." Some of the sticks are kept throughout\r\nthe year and laid on the hearth-fire during heavy thunder-storms to\r\nprevent the house from being struck by lightning, or they are\r\ninserted in the roof with the like intention. Others are placed in\r\nthe fields, gardens, and meadows, with a prayer that God will keep\r\nthem from blight and hail. Such fields and gardens are thought to\r\nthrive more than others; the corn and the plants that grow in them\r\nare not beaten down by hail, nor devoured by mice, vermin, and\r\nbeetles; no witch harms them, and the ears of corn stand close and\r\nfull. The charred sticks are also applied to the plough. The ashes\r\nof the Easter bonfire, together with the ashes of the consecrated\r\npalm-branches, are mixed with the seed at sowing. A wooden figure\r\ncalled Judas is sometimes burned in the consecrated bonfire, and\r\neven where this custom has been abolished the bonfire itself in some\r\nplaces goes by the name of "the burning of Judas."\r\n\r\nThe essentially pagan character of the Easter fire festival appears\r\nplainly both from the mode in which it is celebrated by the peasants\r\nand from the superstitious beliefs which they associate with it. All\r\nover Northern and Central Germany, from Altmark and Anhalt on the\r\neast, through Brunswick, Hanover, Oldenburg, the Harz district, and\r\nHesse to Westphalia the Easter bonfires still blaze simultaneously\r\non the hill-tops. As many as forty may sometimes be counted within\r\nsight at once. Long before Easter the young people have been busy\r\ncollecting firewood; every farmer contributes, and tar-barrels,\r\npetroleum cases, and so forth go to swell the pile. Neighbouring\r\nvillages vie with each other as to which shall send up the greatest\r\nblaze. The fires are always kindled, year after year, on the same\r\nhill, which accordingly often takes the name of Easter Mountain. It\r\nis a fine spectacle to watch from some eminence the bonfires flaring\r\nup one after another on the neighbouring heights. As far as their\r\nlight reaches, so far, in the belief of the peasants, the fields\r\nwill be fruitful, and the houses on which they shine will be safe\r\nfrom conflagration or sickness. At Volkmarsen and other places in\r\nHesse the people used to observe which way the wind blew the flames,\r\nand then they sowed flax seed in that direction, confident that it\r\nwould grow well. Brands taken from the bonfires preserve houses from\r\nbeing struck by lightning; and the ashes increase the fertility of\r\nthe fields, protect them from mice, and mixed with the\r\ndrinking-water of cattle make the animals thrive and ensure them\r\nagainst plague. As the flames die down, young and old leap over\r\nthem, and cattle are sometimes driven through the smouldering\r\nembers. In some places tar-barrels or wheels wrapt in straw used to\r\nbe set on fire, and then sent rolling down the hillside. In others\r\nthe boys light torches and wisps of straw at the bonfires and rush\r\nabout brandishing them in their hands.\r\n\r\nIn M\xfcnsterland these Easter fires are always kindled upon certain\r\ndefinite hills, which are hence known as Easter or Paschal\r\nMountains. The whole community assembles about the fire. The young\r\nmen and maidens, singing Easter hymns, march round and round the\r\nfire, till the blaze dies down. Then the girls jump over the fire in\r\na line, one after the other, each supported by two young men who\r\nhold her hands and run beside her. In the twilight boys with blazing\r\nbundles of straw run over the fields to make them fruitful. At\r\nDelmenhorst, in Oldenburg, it used to be the custom to cut down two\r\ntrees, plant them in the ground side by side, and pile twelve\r\ntar-barrels against each. Brush-wood was then heaped about the\r\ntrees, and on the evening of Easter Saturday the boys, after rushing\r\nabout with blazing bean-poles in their hands, set fire to the whole.\r\nAt the end of the ceremony the urchins tried to blacken each other\r\nand the clothes of grown-up people. In the Altmark it is believed\r\nthat as far as the blaze of the Easter bonfire is visible, the corn\r\nwill grow well throughout the year, and no conflagration will break\r\nout. At Braunr\xf6de, in the Harz Mountains, it was the custom to burn\r\nsquirrels in the Easter bonfire. In the Altmark, bones were burned\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nNear Forchheim, in Upper Franken, a straw-man called the Judas used\r\nto be burned in the churchyards on Easter Saturday. The whole\r\nvillage contributed wood to the pyre on which he perished, and the\r\ncharred sticks were afterwards kept and planted in the fields on\r\nWalpurgis Day (the first of May) to preserve the wheat from blight\r\nand mildew. About a hundred years ago or more the custom at\r\nAlthenneberg, in Upper Bavaria, used to be as follows. On the\r\nafternoon of Easter Saturday the lads collected wood, which they\r\npiled in a cornfield, while in the middle of the pile they set up a\r\ntall wooden cross all swathed in straw. After the evening service\r\nthey lighted their lanterns at the consecrated candle in the church,\r\nand ran with them at full speed to the pyre, each striving to get\r\nthere first. The first to arrive set fire to the heap. No woman or\r\ngirl might come near the bonfire, but they were allowed to watch it\r\nfrom a distance. As the flames rose the men and lads rejoiced and\r\nmade merry, shouting, "We are burning the Judas!" The man who had\r\nbeen the first to reach the pyre and to kindle it was rewarded on\r\nEaster Sunday by the women, who gave him coloured eggs at the church\r\ndoor. The object of the whole ceremony was to keep off the hail. At\r\nother villages of Upper Bavaria the ceremony, which took place\r\nbetween nine and ten at night on Easter Saturday, was called\r\n"burning the Easter Man." On a height about a mile from the village\r\nthe young fellows set up a tall cross enveloped in straw, so that it\r\nlooked like a man with his arms stretched out. This was the Easter\r\nMan. No lad under eighteen years of age might take part in the\r\nceremony. One of the young men stationed himself beside the Easter\r\nMan, holding in his hand a consecrated taper which he had brought\r\nfrom the church and lighted. The rest stood at equal intervals in a\r\ngreat circle round the cross. At a given signal they raced thrice\r\nround the circle, and then at a second signal ran straight at the\r\ncross and at the lad with the lighted taper beside it; the one who\r\nreached the goal first had the right of setting fire to the Easter\r\nMan. Great was the jubilation while he was burning. When he had been\r\nconsumed in the flames, three lads were chosen from among the rest,\r\nand each of the three drew a circle on the ground with a stick\r\nthrice round the ashes. Then they all left the spot. On Easter\r\nMonday the villagers gathered the ashes and strewed them on their\r\nfields; also they planted in the fields palmbranches which had been\r\nconsecrated on Palm Sunday, and sticks which had been charred and\r\nhallowed on Good Friday, all for the purpose of protecting their\r\nfields against showers of hail. In some parts of Swabia the Easter\r\nfires might not be kindled with iron or steel or flint, but only by\r\nthe friction of wood.\r\n\r\nThe custom of the Easter fires appears to have prevailed all over\r\nCentral and Western Germany from north to south. We find it also in\r\nHolland, where the fires were kindled on the highest eminences, and\r\nthe people danced round them and leaped through the flames or over\r\nthe glowing embers. Here too, as often in Germany, the materials for\r\nthe bonfire were collected by the young folk from door to door. In\r\nmany parts of Sweden firearms are discharged in all directions on\r\nEaster Eve, and huge bonfires are lighted on hills and eminences.\r\nSome people think that the intention is to keep off the Troll and\r\nother evil spirits who are especially active at this season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The Beltane Fires\r\n\r\nIN THE CENTRAL Highlands of Scotland bonfires, known as the Beltane\r\nfires, were formerly kindled with great ceremony on the first of\r\nMay, and the traces of human sacrifices at them were particularly\r\nclear and unequivocal. The custom of lighting the bonfires lasted in\r\nvarious places far into the eighteenth century, and the descriptions\r\nof the ceremony by writers of that period present such a curious and\r\ninteresting picture of ancient heathendom surviving in our own\r\ncountry that I will reproduce them in the words of their authors.\r\nThe fullest of the descriptions is the one bequeathed to us by John\r\nRamsay, laird of Ochtertyre, near Crieff, the patron of Burns and\r\nthe friend of Sir Walter Scott. He says: "But the most considerable\r\nof the Druidical festivals is that of Beltane, or May-day, which was\r\nlately observed in some parts of the Highlands with extraordinary\r\nceremonies. . . . Like the other public worship of the Druids, the\r\nBeltane feast seems to have been performed on hills or eminences.\r\nThey thought it degrading to him whose temple is the universe, to\r\nsuppose that he would dwell in any house made with hands. Their\r\nsacrifices were therefore offered in the open air, frequently upon\r\nthe tops of hills, where they were presented with the grandest views\r\nof nature, and were nearest the seat of warmth and order. And,\r\naccording to tradition, such was the manner of celebrating this\r\nfestival in the Highlands within the last hundred years. But since\r\nthe decline of superstition, it has been celebrated by the people of\r\neach hamlet on some hill or rising ground around which their cattle\r\nwere pasturing. Thither the young folks repaired in the morning, and\r\ncut a trench, on the summit of which a seat of turf was formed for\r\nthe company. And in the middle a pile of wood or other fuel was\r\nplaced, which of old they kindled with _tein-eigin_--_i.e.,_\r\nforced-fire or _need-fire._ Although, for many years past, they have\r\nbeen contented with common fire, yet we shall now describe the\r\nprocess, because it will hereafter appear that recourse is still had\r\nto the _tein-eigin_ upon extraordinary emergencies.\r\n\r\n"The night before, all the fires in the country were carefully\r\nextinguished, and next morning the materials for exciting this\r\nsacred fire were prepared. The most primitive method seems to be\r\nthat which was used in the islands of Skye, Mull, and Tiree. A\r\nwell-seasoned plank of oak was procured, in the midst of which a\r\nhole was bored. A wimble of the same timber was then applied, the\r\nend of which they fitted to the hole. But in some parts of the\r\nmainland the machinery was different. They used a frame of green\r\nwood, of a square form, in the centre of which was an axle-tree. In\r\nsome places three times three persons, in others three times nine,\r\nwere required for turning round by turns the axle-tree or wimble. If\r\nany of them had been guilty of murder, adultery, theft, or other\r\natrocious crime, it was imagined either that the fire would not\r\nkindle, or that it would be devoid of its usual virtue. So soon as\r\nany sparks were emitted by means of the violent friction, they\r\napplied a species of agaric which grows on old birch-trees, and is\r\nvery combustible. This fire had the appearance of being immediately\r\nderived from heaven, and manifold were the virtues ascribed to it.\r\nThey esteemed it a preservative against witch-craft, and a sovereign\r\nremedy against malignant diseases, both in the human species and in\r\ncattle; and by it the strongest poisons were supposed to have their\r\nnature changed.\r\n\r\n"After kindling the bonfire with the _tein-eigin_ the company\r\nprepared their victuals. And as soon as they had finished their\r\nmeal, they amused themselves a while in singing and dancing round\r\nthe fire. Towards the close of the entertainment, the person who\r\nofficiated as master of the feast produced a large cake baked with\r\neggs and scalloped round the edge, called _am bonnach\r\nbea-tine_--_i.e.,_ the Beltane cake. It was divided into a number of\r\npieces, and distributed in great form to the company. There was one\r\nparticular piece which whoever got was called _cailleach\r\nbeal-tine_--_i.e.,_ the Beltane _carline,_ a term of great reproach.\r\nUpon his being known, part of the company laid hold of him and made\r\na show of putting him into the fire; but the majority interposing,\r\nhe was rescued. And in some places they laid him flat on the ground,\r\nmaking as if they would quarter him. Afterwards, he was pelted with\r\negg-shells, and retained the odious appellation during the whole\r\nyear. And while the feast was fresh in people\'s memory, they\r\naffected to speak of the _cailleach beal-tine_ as dead."\r\n\r\nIn the parish of Callander, a beautiful district of Western\r\nPerthshire, the Beltane custom was still in vogue towards the end of\r\nthe eighteenth century. It has been described as follows by the\r\nparish minister of the time: "Upon the first day of May, which is\r\ncalled _Beltan,_ or _Baltein_ day, all the boys in a township or\r\nhamlet, meet in the moors. They cut a table in the green sod, of a\r\nround figure, by casting a trench in the ground, of such\r\ncircumference as to hold the whole company. They kindle a fire, and\r\ndress a repast of eggs and milk in the consistence of a custard.\r\nThey knead a cake of oatmeal, which is toasted at the embers against\r\na stone. After the custard is eaten up, they divide the cake into so\r\nmany portions, as similar as possible to one another in size and\r\nshape, as there are persons in the company. They daub one of these\r\nportions all over with charcoal, until it be perfectly black. They\r\nput all the bits of the cake into a bonnet. Every one, blindfold,\r\ndraws out a portion. He who holds the bonnet, is entitled to the\r\nlast bit. Whoever draws the black bit, is the _devoted_ person who\r\nis to be sacrificed to _Baal,_ whose favour they mean to implore, in\r\nrendering the year productive of the sustenance of man and beast.\r\nThere is little doubt of these inhuman sacrifices having been once\r\noffered in this country, as well as in the east, although they now\r\npass from the act of sacrificing, and only compel the _devoted_\r\nperson to leap three times through the flames; with which the\r\nceremonies of this festival are closed."\r\n\r\nThomas Pennant, who travelled in Perthshire in the year 1769, tells\r\nus that "on the first of May, the herdsmen of every village hold\r\ntheir Bel-tien, a rural sacrifice. They cut a square trench on the\r\nground, leaving the turf in the middle; on that they make a fire of\r\nwood, on which they dress a large caudle of eggs, butter, oatmeal\r\nand milk; and bring besides the ingredients of the caudle, plenty of\r\nbeer and whisky; for each of the company must contribute something.\r\nThe rites begin with spilling some of the caudle on the ground, by\r\nway of libation: on that every one takes a cake of oatmeal, upon\r\nwhich are raised nine square knobs, each dedicated to some\r\nparticular being, the supposed preserver of their flocks and herds,\r\nor to some particular animal, the real destroyer of them: each\r\nperson then turns his face to the fire, breaks off a knob, and\r\nflinging it over his shoulders, says, \'This I give to thee, preserve\r\nthou my horses; this to thee, preserve thou my sheep; and so on.\'\r\nAfter that, they use the same ceremony to the noxious animals: \'This\r\nI give to thee, O fox! spare thou my lambs; this to thee, O hooded\r\ncrow! this to thee, O eagle!\' When the ceremony is over, they dine\r\non the caudle; and after the feast is finished, what is left is hid\r\nby two persons deputed for that purpose; but on the next Sunday they\r\nreassemble, and finish the reliques of the first entertainment."\r\n\r\nAnother writer of the eighteenth century has described the Beltane\r\nfestival as it was held in the parish of Logierait in Perthshire. He\r\nsays: "On the first of May, O.S., a festival called _Beltan_ is\r\nannually held here. It is chiefly celebrated by the cow-herds, who\r\nassemble by scores in the fields, to dress a dinner for themselves,\r\nof boiled milk and eggs. These dishes they eat with a sort of cakes\r\nbaked for the occasion, and having small lumps in the form of\r\n_nipples,_ raised all over the surface." In this last account no\r\nmention is made of bonfires, but they were probably lighted, for a\r\ncontemporary writer informs us that in the parish of Kirkmichael,\r\nwhich adjoins the parish of Logierait on the east, the custom of\r\nlighting a fire in the fields and baking a consecrated cake on the\r\nfirst of May was not quite obsolete in his time. We may conjecture\r\nthat the cake with knobs was formerly used for the purpose of\r\ndetermining who should be the "Beltane carline" or victim doomed to\r\nthe flames. A trace of this custom survived, perhaps, in the custom\r\nof baking oatmeal cakes of a special kind and rolling them down hill\r\nabout noon on the first of May; for it was thought that the person\r\nwhose cake broke as it rolled would die or be unfortunate within the\r\nyear. These cakes, or bannocks as we call them in Scotland, were\r\nbaked in the usual way, but they were washed over with a thin batter\r\ncomposed of whipped egg, milk or cream, and a little oatmeal. This\r\ncustom appears to have prevailed at or near Kingussie in\r\nInverness-shire.\r\n\r\nIn the north-east of Scotland the Beltane fires were still kindled\r\nin the latter half of the eighteenth century; the herdsmen of\r\nseveral farms used to gather dry wood, kindle it, and dance three\r\ntimes "southways" about the burning pile. But in this region,\r\naccording to a later authority, the Beltane fires were lit not on\r\nthe first but on the second of May, Old Style. They were called\r\nbone-fires. The people believed that on that evening and night the\r\nwitches were abroad and busy casting spells on cattle and stealing\r\ncows\' milk. To counteract their machinations, pieces of rowan-tree\r\nand woodbine, but especially of rowan-tree, were placed over the\r\ndoors of the cow-houses, and fires were kindled by every farmer and\r\ncottar. Old thatch, straw, furze, or broom was piled in a heap and\r\nset on fire a little after sunset. While some of the bystanders kept\r\ntossing the blazing mass, others hoisted portions of it on\r\npitchforks or poles and ran hither and thither, holding them as high\r\nas they could. Meantime the young people danced round the fire or\r\nran through the smoke shouting, "Fire! blaze and burn the witches;\r\nfire! fire! burn the witches." In some districts a large round cake\r\nof oat or barley meal was rolled through the ashes. When all the\r\nfuel was consumed, the people scattered the ashes far and wide, and\r\ntill the night grew quite dark they continued to run through them,\r\ncrying, "Fire! burn the witches."\r\n\r\nIn the Hebrides "the Beltane bannock is smaller than that made at\r\nSt. Michael\'s, but is made in the same way; it is no longer made in\r\nUist, but Father Allan remembers seeing his grandmother make one\r\nabout twenty-five years ago. There was also a cheese made, generally\r\non the first of May, which was kept to the next Beltane as a sort of\r\ncharm against the bewitching of milk-produce. The Beltane customs\r\nseem to have been the same as elsewhere. Every fire was put out and\r\na large one lit on the top of the hill, and the cattle driven round\r\nit sunwards (_dessil_), to keep off murrain all the year. Each man\r\nwould take home fire wherewith to kindle his own."\r\n\r\nIn Wales also the custom of lighting Beltane fires at the beginning\r\nof May used to be observed, but the day on which they were kindled\r\nvaried from the eve of May Day to the third of May. The flame was\r\nsometimes elicited by the friction of two pieces of oak, as appears\r\nfrom the following description. "The fire was done in this way. Nine\r\nmen would turn their pockets inside out, and see that every piece of\r\nmoney and all metals were off their persons. Then the men went into\r\nthe nearest woods, and collected sticks of nine different kinds of\r\ntrees. These were carried to the spot where the fire had to be\r\nbuilt. There a circle was cut in the sod, and the sticks were set\r\ncrosswise. All around the circle the people stood and watched the\r\nproceedings. One of the men would then take two bits of oak, and rub\r\nthem together until a flame was kindled. This was applied to the\r\nsticks, and soon a large fire was made. Sometimes two fires were set\r\nup side by side. These fires, whether one or two, were called\r\n_coelcerth_ or bonfire. Round cakes of oatmeal and brown meal were\r\nsplit in four, and placed in a small flour-bag, and everybody\r\npresent had to pick out a portion. The last bit in the bag fell to\r\nthe lot of the bag-holder. Each person who chanced to pick up a\r\npiece of brown-meal cake was compelled to leap three times over the\r\nflames, or to run thrice between the two fires, by which means the\r\npeople thought they were sure of a plentiful harvest. Shouts and\r\nscreams of those who had to face the ordeal could be heard ever so\r\nfar, and those who chanced to pick the oatmeal portions sang and\r\ndanced and clapped their hands in approval, as the holders of the\r\nbrown bits leaped three times over the flames, or ran three times\r\nbetween the two fires."\r\n\r\nThe belief of the people that by leaping thrice over the bonfires or\r\nrunning thrice between them they ensured a plentiful harvest is\r\nworthy of note. The mode in which this result was supposed to be\r\nbrought about is indicated by another writer on Welsh folk-lore,\r\naccording to whom it used to be held that "the bonfires lighted in\r\nMay or Midsummer protected the lands from sorcery, so that good\r\ncrops would follow. The ashes were also considered valuable as\r\ncharms." Hence it appears that the heat of the fires was thought to\r\nfertilise the fields, not directly by quickening the seeds in the\r\nground, but indirectly by counteracting the baleful influence of\r\nwitchcraft or perhaps by burning up the persons of the witches.\r\n\r\nThe Beltane fires seem to have been kindled also in Ireland, for\r\nCormac, "or somebody in his name, says that _belltaine,_ May-day,\r\nwas so called from the \'lucky fire,\' or the \'two fires,\' which the\r\ndruids of Erin used to make on that day with great incantations; and\r\ncattle, he adds, used to be brought to those fires, or to be driven\r\nbetween them, as a safeguard against the diseases of the year." The\r\ncustom of driving cattle through or between fires on May Day or the\r\neve of May Day persisted in Ireland down to a time within living\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nThe first of May is a great popular festival in the more midland and\r\nsouthern parts of Sweden. On the eve of the festival huge bonfires,\r\nwhich should be lighted by striking two flints together, blaze on\r\nall the hills and knolls. Every large hamlet has its own fire, round\r\nwhich the young people dance in a ring. The old folk notice whether\r\nthe flames incline to the north or to the south. In the former case,\r\nthe spring will be cold and backward; in the latter, it will be mild\r\nand genial. In Bohemia, on the eve of May Day, young people kindle\r\nfires on hills and eminences, at crossways, and in pastures, and\r\ndance round them. They leap over the glowing embers or even through\r\nthe flames. The ceremony is called "burning the witches." In some\r\nplaces an effigy representing a witch used to be burnt in the\r\nbonfire. We have to remember that the eve of May Day is the\r\nnotorious Walpurgis Night, when the witches are everywhere speeding\r\nunseen through the air on their hellish errands. On this witching\r\nnight children in Voigtland also light bonfires on the heights and\r\nleap over them. Moreover, they wave burning brooms or toss them into\r\nthe air. So far as the light of the bonfire reaches, so far will a\r\nblessing rest on the fields. The kindling of the fires on Walpurgis\r\nNight is called "driving away the witches." The custom of kindling\r\nfires on the eve of May Day (Walpurgis Night) for the purpose of\r\nburning the witches is, or used to be, widespread in the Tyrol,\r\nMoravia, Saxony and Silesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The Midsummer Fires\r\n\r\nBUT THE SEASON at which these firefestivals have been most generally\r\nheld all over Europe is the summer solstice, that is Midsummer Eve\r\n(the twenty-third of June) or Midsummer day (the twenty-fourth of\r\nJune). A faint tinge of Christianity has been given to them by\r\nnaming Midsummer Day after St. John the Baptist, but we cannot doubt\r\nthat the celebration dates from a time long before the beginning of\r\nour era. The summer solstice, or Midsummer Day, is the great\r\nturning-point in the sun\'s career, when, after climbing higher and\r\nhigher day by day in the sky, the luminary stops and thenceforth\r\nretraces his steps down the heavenly road. Such a moment could not\r\nbut be regarded with anxiety by primitive man so soon as he began to\r\nobserve and ponder the courses of the great lights across the\r\ncelestial vault; and having still to learn his own powerlessness in\r\nface of the vast cyclic changes of nature, he may have fancied that\r\nhe could help the sun in his seeming decline--could prop his failing\r\nsteps and rekindle the sinking flame of the red lamp in his feeble\r\nhand. In some such thoughts as these the midsummer festivals of our\r\nEuropean peasantry may perhaps have taken their rise. Whatever their\r\norigin, they have prevailed all over this quarter of the globe, from\r\nIreland on the west to Russia on the east, and from Norway and\r\nSweden on the north to Spain and Greece on the south. According to a\r\nmediaeval writer, the three great features of the midsummer\r\ncelebration were the bonfires, the procession with torches round the\r\nfields, and the custom of rolling a wheel. He tells us that boys\r\nburned bones and filth of various kinds to make a foul smoke, and\r\nthat the smoke drove away certain noxious dragons which at this\r\ntime, excited by the summer heat, copulated in the air and poisoned\r\nthe wells and rivers by dropping their seed into them; and he\r\nexplains the custom of trundling a wheel to mean that the sun,\r\nhaving now reached the highest point in the ecliptic, begins\r\nthenceforward to descend.\r\n\r\nThe main features of the midsummer fire-festival resemble those\r\nwhich we have found to characterise the vernal festivals of fire.\r\nThe similarity of the two sets of ceremonies will plainly appear\r\nfrom the following examples.\r\n\r\nA writer of the first half of the sixteenth century informs us that\r\nin almost every village and town of Germany public bonfires were\r\nkindled on the Eve of St. John, and young and old, of both sexes,\r\ngathered about them and passed the time in dancing and singing.\r\nPeople on this occasion wore chaplets of mugwort and vervain, and\r\nthey looked at the fire through bunches of larkspur which they held\r\nin their hands, believing that this would preserve their eyes in a\r\nhealthy state throughout the year. As each departed, he threw the\r\nmugwort and vervain into the fire, saying, "May all my ill-luck\r\ndepart and be burnt up with these." At Lower Konz, a village\r\nsituated on a hillside overlooking the Moselle, the midsummer\r\nfestival used to be celebrated as follows. A quantity of straw was\r\ncollected on the top of the steep Stromberg Hill. Every inhabitant,\r\nor at least every householder, had to contribute his share of straw\r\nto the pile. At nightfall the whole male population, men and boys,\r\nmustered on the top of the hill; the women and girls were not\r\nallowed to join them, but had to take up their position at a certain\r\nspring half-way down the slope. On the summit stood a huge wheel\r\ncompletely encased in some of the straw which had been jointly\r\ncontributed by the villagers; the rest of the straw was made into\r\ntorches. From each side of the wheel the axle-tree projected about\r\nthree feet, thus furnishing handles to the lads who were to guide it\r\nin its descent. The mayor of the neighbouring town of Sierck, who\r\nalways received a basket of cherries for his services, gave the\r\nsignal; a lighted torch was applied to the wheel, and as it burst\r\ninto flame, two young fellows, strong-limbed and swift of foot,\r\nseized the handles and began running with it down the slope. A great\r\nshout went up. Every man and boy waved a blazing torch in the air,\r\nand took care to keep it alight so long as the wheel was trundling\r\ndown the hill. The great object of the young men who guided the\r\nwheel was to plunge it blazing into the water of the Moselle; but\r\nthey rarely succeeded in their efforts, for the vineyards which\r\ncover the greater part of the declivity impeded their progress, and\r\nthe wheel was often burned out before it reached the river. As it\r\nrolled past the women and girls at the spring, they raised cries of\r\njoy which were answered by the men on the top of the mountain; and\r\nthe shouts were echoed by the inhabitants of neighbouring villages\r\nwho watched the spectacle from their hills on the opposite bank of\r\nthe Moselle. If the fiery wheel was successfully conveyed to the\r\nbank of the river and extinguished in the water, the people looked\r\nfor an abundant vintage that year, and the inhabitants of Konz had\r\nthe right to exact a waggon-load of white wine from the surrounding\r\nvineyards. On the other hand, they believed that, if they neglected\r\nto perform the ceremony, the cattle would be attacked by giddiness\r\nand convulsions and would dance in their stalls.\r\n\r\nDown at least to the middle of the nineteenth century the midsummer\r\nfires used to blaze all over Upper Bavaria. They were kindled\r\nespecially on the mountains, but also far and wide in the lowlands,\r\nand we are told that in the darkness and stillness of night the\r\nmoving groups, lit up by the flickering glow of the flames,\r\npresented an impressive spectacle. Cattle were driven through the\r\nfire to cure the sick animals and to guard such as were sound\r\nagainst plague and harm of every kind throughout the year. Many a\r\nhouseholder on that day put out the fire on the domestic hearth and\r\nrekindled it by means of a brand taken from the midsummer bonfire.\r\nThe people judged of the height to which the flax would grow in the\r\nyear by the height to which the flames of the bonfire rose; and\r\nwhoever leaped over the burning pile was sure not to suffer from\r\nbackache in reaping the corn at harvest. In many parts of Bavaria it\r\nwas believed that the flax would grow as high as the young people\r\nleaped over the fire. In others the old folk used to plant three\r\ncharred sticks from the bonfire in the fields, believing that this\r\nwould make the flax grow tall. Elsewhere an extinguished brand was\r\nput in the roof of the house to protect it against fire. In the\r\ntowns about W\xfcrzburg the bonfires used to be kindled in the\r\nmarket-places, and the young people who jumped over them wore\r\ngarlands of flowers, especially of mugwort and vervain, and carried\r\nsprigs of larkspur in their hands. They thought that such as looked\r\nat the fire holding a bit of larkspur before their face would be\r\ntroubled by no malady of the eyes throughout the year. Further, it\r\nwas customary at W\xfcrzburg, in the sixteenth century, for the\r\nbishop\'s followers to throw burning discs of wood into the air from\r\na mountain which overhangs the town. The discs were discharged by\r\nmeans of flexible rods, and in their flight through the darkness\r\npresented the appearance of fiery dragons.\r\n\r\nSimilarly in Swabia, lads and lasses, hand in hand, leap over the\r\nmidsummer bonfire, praying that the hemp may grow three ells high,\r\nand they set fire to wheels of straw and send them rolling down the\r\nhill. Sometimes, as the people sprang over the midsummer bonfire\r\nthey cried out, "Flax, flax! may the flax this year grow seven ells\r\nhigh!" At Rottenburg a rude effigy in human form, called the\r\nAngelman, used to be enveloped in flowers and then burnt in the\r\nmidsummer fire by boys, who afterwards leaped over the glowing\r\nembers.\r\n\r\nSo in Baden the children collected fuel from house to house for the\r\nmidsummer bonfire on St. John\'s Day; and lads and lasses leaped over\r\nthe fire in couples. Here, as elsewhere, a close connexion was\r\ntraced between these bonfires and the harvest. In some places it was\r\nthought that those who leaped over the fires would not suffer from\r\nbackache at reaping. Sometimes, as the young folk sprang over the\r\nflames, they cried, "Grow, that the hemp may be three ells high!"\r\nThis notion that the hemp or the corn would grow as high as the\r\nflames blazed or as the people jumped over them, seems to have been\r\nwidespread in Baden. It was held that the parents of the young\r\npeople who bounded highest over the fire would have the most\r\nabundant harvest; and on the other hand, if a man contributed\r\nnothing to the bonfire, it was imagined that there would be no\r\nblessing on his crops, and that his hemp in particular would never\r\ngrow. At Edersleben, near Sangerhausen, a high pole was planted in\r\nthe ground and a tarbarrel was hung from it by a chain which reached\r\nto the ground. The barrel was then set on fire and swung round the\r\npole amid shouts of joy.\r\n\r\nIn Denmark and Norway also midsummer fires were kindled on St.\r\nJohn\'s Eve on roads, open spaces, and hills. People in Norway\r\nthought that the fires banished sickness from among the cattle. Even\r\nyet the fires are said to be lighted all over Norway on Midsummer\r\nEve. They are kindled in order to keep off the witches, who are said\r\nto be flying from all parts that night to the Blocksberg, where the\r\nbig witch lives. In Sweden the Eve of St. John (St. Hans) is the\r\nmost joyous night of the whole year. Throughout some parts of the\r\ncountry, especially in the provinces of Bohus and Scania and in\r\ndistricts bordering on Norway, it is celebrated by the frequent\r\ndischarge of firearms and by huge bonfires, formerly called Balder\'s\r\nBalefires (_Balder\'s Balar_), which are kindled at dusk on hills and\r\neminences and throw a glare of light over the surrounding landscape.\r\nThe people dance round the fires and leap over or through them. In\r\nparts of Norrland on St. John\'s Eve the bonfires are lit at the\r\ncross-roads. The fuel consists of nine different sorts of wood, and\r\nthe spectators cast into the flames a kind of toad-stool (_B\xe4ran_)\r\nin order to counteract the power of the Trolls and other evil\r\nspirits, who are believed to be abroad that night; for at that\r\nmystic season the mountains open and from their cavernous depths the\r\nuncanny crew pours forth to dance and disport themselves for a time.\r\nThe peasants believe that should any of the Trolls be in the\r\nvicinity they will show themselves; and if an animal, for example a\r\nhe or she goat, happens to be seen near the blazing, crackling pile,\r\nthe peasants are firmly persuaded that it is no other than the Evil\r\nOne in person. Further, it deserves to be remarked that in Sweden\r\nSt. John\'s Eve is a festival of water as well as of fire; for\r\ncertain holy springs are then supposed to be endowed with wonderful\r\nmedicinal virtues, and many sick people resort to them for the\r\nhealing of their infirmities.\r\n\r\nIn Austria the midsummer customs and superstitions resemble those of\r\nGermany. Thus in some parts of the Tyrol bonfires are kindled and\r\nburning discs hurled into the air. In the lower valley of the Inn a\r\ntatterdemalion effigy is carted about the village on Midsummer Day\r\nand then burned. He is called the _Lotter,_ which has been corrupted\r\ninto Luther. At Ambras, one of the villages where Martin Luther is\r\nthus burned in effigy, they say that if you go through the village\r\nbetween eleven and twelve on St. John\'s Night and wash yourself in\r\nthree wells, you will see all who are to die in the following year.\r\nAt Gratz on St. John\'s Eve (the twenty-third of June) the common\r\npeople used to make a puppet called the _Tatermann,_ which they\r\ndragged to the bleaching ground, and pelted with burning besoms till\r\nit took fire. At Reutte, in the Tyrol, people believed that the flax\r\nwould grow as high as they leaped over the midsummer bonfire, and\r\nthey took pieces of charred wood from the fire and stuck them in\r\ntheir flax-fields the same night, leaving them there till the flax\r\nharvest had been got in. In Lower Austria bonfires are kindled on\r\nthe heights, and the boys caper round them, brandishing lighted\r\ntorches drenched in pitch. Whoever jumps thrice across the fire will\r\nnot suffer from fever within the year. Cart-wheels are often smeared\r\nwith pitch, ignited, and sent rolling and blazing down the\r\nhillsides.\r\n\r\nAll over Bohemia bonfires still burn on Midsummer Eve. In the\r\nafternoon boys go about with handcarts from house to house\r\ncollecting fuel and threatening with evil consequences the\r\ncurmudgeons who refuse them a dole. Sometimes the young men fell a\r\ntall straight fir in the woods and set it up on a height, where the\r\ngirls deck it with nosegays, wreaths of leaves, and red ribbons.\r\nThen brushwood is piled about it, and at nightfall the whole is set\r\non fire. While the flames break out, the young men climb the tree\r\nand fetch down the wreaths which the girls had placed on it. After\r\nthat lads and lasses stand on opposite sides of the fire and look at\r\none another through the wreaths to see whether they will be true to\r\neach other and marry within the year. Also the girls throw the\r\nwreaths across the flames to the men, and woe to the awkward swain\r\nwho fails to catch the wreath thrown him by his sweetheart. When the\r\nblaze has died down, each couple takes hands and leaps thrice across\r\nthe fire. He or she who does so will be free from ague throughout\r\nthe year, and the flax will grow as high as the young folks leap. A\r\ngirl who sees nine bonfires on Midsummer Eve will marry before the\r\nyear is out. The singed wreaths are carried home and carefully\r\npreserved throughout the year. During thunderstorms a bit of the\r\nwreath is burned on the hearth with a prayer; some of it is given to\r\nkine that are sick or calving, and some of it serves to fumigate\r\nhouse and cattle-stall, that man and beast may keep hale and well.\r\nSometimes an old cart-wheel is smeared with resin, ignited, and sent\r\nrolling down the hill. Often the boys collect all the worn-out\r\nbesoms they can get hold of, dip them in pitch, and having set them\r\non fire wave them about or throw them high into the air. Or they\r\nrush down the hillside in troops, brandishing the flaming brooms and\r\nshouting. The stumps of the brooms and embers from the fire are\r\npreserved and stuck in cabbage gardens to protect the cabbages from\r\ncaterpillars and gnats. Some people insert charred sticks and ashes\r\nfrom the midsummer bonfire in their sown fields and meadows, in\r\ntheir gardens and the roofs of their houses, as a talisman against\r\nlightning and foul weather; or they fancy that the ashes placed in\r\nthe roof will prevent any fire from breaking out in the house. In\r\nsome districts they crown or gird themselves with mugwort while the\r\nmidsummer fire is burning, for this is supposed to be a protection\r\nagainst ghosts, witches, and sickness; in particular, a wreath of\r\nmugwort is a sure preventive of sore eyes. Sometimes the girls look\r\nat the bonfires through garlands of wild flowers, praying the fire\r\nto strengthen their eyes and eyelids. She who does this thrice will\r\nhave no sore eyes all that year. In some parts of Bohemia they used\r\nto drive the cows through the midsummer fire to guard them against\r\nwitchcraft.\r\n\r\nIn Slavonic countries, also, the midsummer festival is celebrated\r\nwith similar rites. We have already seen that in Russia on the Eve\r\nof St. John young men and maidens jump over a bonfire in couples\r\ncarrying a straw effigy of Kupalo in their arms. In some parts of\r\nRussia an image of Kupalo is burnt or thrown into a stream on St.\r\nJohn\'s Night. Again, in some districts of Russia the young folk wear\r\ngarlands of flowers and girdles of holy herbs when they spring\r\nthrough the smoke or flames; and sometimes they drive the cattle\r\nalso through the fire in order to protect the animals against\r\nwizards and witches, who are then ravenous after milk. In Little\r\nRussia a stake is driven into the ground on St. John\'s Night, wrapt\r\nin straw, and set on fire. As the flames rise the peasant women\r\nthrow birchen boughs into them, saying, "May my flax be as tall as\r\nthis bough!" In Ruthenia the bonfires are lighted by a flame\r\nprocured by the friction of wood. While the elders of the party are\r\nengaged in thus "churning" the fire, the rest maintain a respectful\r\nsilence; but when the flame bursts from the wood, they break forth\r\ninto joyous songs. As soon as the bonfires are kindled, the young\r\npeople take hands and leap in pairs through the smoke, if not\r\nthrough the flames; and after that the cattle in their turn are\r\ndriven through the fire.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of Prussia and Lithuania great fires are kindled on\r\nMidsummer Eve. All the heights are ablaze with them, as far as the\r\neye can see. The fires are supposed to be a protection against\r\nwitchcraft, thunder, hail, and cattle disease, especially if next\r\nmorning the cattle are driven over the places where the fires\r\nburned. Above all, the bonfires ensure the farmer against the arts\r\nof witches, who try to steal the milk from his cows by charms and\r\nspells. That is why next morning you may see the young fellows who\r\nlit the bonfire going from house to house and receiving jugfuls of\r\nmilk. And for the same reason they stick burs and mugwort on the\r\ngate or the hedge through which the cows go to pasture, because that\r\nis supposed to be a preservative against witchcraft. In Masuren, a\r\ndistrict of Eastern Prussia inhabited by a branch of the Polish\r\nfamily, it is the custom on the evening of Midsummer Day to put out\r\nall the fires in the village. Then an oaken stake is driven into the\r\nground and a wheel is fixed on it as on an axle. This wheel the\r\nvillagers, working by relays, cause to revolve with great rapidity\r\ntill fire is produced by friction. Every one takes home a lighted\r\nbrand from the new fire and with it rekindles the fire on the\r\ndomestic hearth. In Serbia on Midsummer Eve herdsmen light torches\r\nof birch bark and march round the sheepfolds and cattle-stalls; then\r\nthey climb the hills and there allow the torches to burn out.\r\n\r\nAmong the Magyars in Hungary the midsummer fire-festival is marked\r\nby the same features that meet us in so many parts of Europe. On\r\nMidsummer Eve in many places it is customary to kindle bonfires on\r\nheights and to leap over them, and from the manner in which the\r\nyoung people leap the bystanders predict whether they will marry\r\nsoon. On this day also many Hungarian swineherds make fire by\r\nrotating a wheel round a wooden axle wrapt in hemp, and through the\r\nfire thus made they drive their pigs to preserve them from sickness.\r\n\r\nThe Esthonians of Russia, who, like the Magyars, belong to the great\r\nTuranian family of mankind, also celebrate the summer solstice in\r\nthe usual way. They think that the St. John\'s fire keeps witches\r\nfrom the cattle, and they say that he who does not come to it will\r\nhave his barley full of thistles and his oats full of weeds. In the\r\nEsthonian island of Oesel, while they throw fuel into the midsummer\r\nfire, they call out, "Weeds to the fire, flax to the field," or they\r\nfling three billets into the flames, saying, "Flax grow long!" And\r\nthey take charred sticks from the bonfire home with them and keep\r\nthem to make the cattle thrive. In some parts of the island the\r\nbonfire is formed by piling brushwood and other combustibles round a\r\ntree, at the top of which a flag flies. Whoever succeeds in knocking\r\ndown the flag with a pole before it begins to burn will have good\r\nluck. Formerly the festivities lasted till daybreak, and ended in\r\nscenes of debauchery which looked doubly hideous by the growing\r\nlight of a summer morning.\r\n\r\nWhen we pass from the east to the west of Europe we still find the\r\nsummer solstice celebrated with rites of the same general character.\r\nDown to about the middle of the nineteenth century the custom of\r\nlighting bonfires at midsummer prevailed so commonly in France that\r\nthere was hardly a town or a village, we are told, where they were\r\nnot kindled. People danced round and leaped over them, and took\r\ncharred sticks from the bonfire home with them to protect the houses\r\nagainst lightning, conflagrations, and spells.\r\n\r\nIn Brittany, apparently, the custom of the midsummer bonfires is\r\nkept up to this day. When the flames have died down, the whole\r\nassembly kneels round about the bonfire and an old man prays aloud.\r\nThen they all rise and march thrice round the fire; at the third\r\nturn they stop and every one picks up a pebble and throws it on the\r\nburning pile. After that they disperse. In Brittany and Berry it is\r\nbelieved that a girl who dances round nine midsummer bonfires will\r\nmarry within the year. In the valley of the Orne the custom was to\r\nkindle the bonfire just at the moment when the sun was about to dip\r\nbelow the horizon; and the peasants drove their cattle through the\r\nfires to protect them against witchcraft, especially against the\r\nspells of witches and wizards who attempted to steal the milk and\r\nbutter. At Jumi\xe8ges in Normandy, down to the first half of the\r\nnineteenth century, the midsummer festival was marked by certain\r\nsingular features which bore the stamp of a very high antiquity.\r\nEvery year, on the twenty-third of June, the Eve of St. John, the\r\nBrotherhood of the Green Wolf chose a new chief or master, who had\r\nalways to be taken from the hamlet of Conihout. On being elected,\r\nthe new head of the brotherhood assumed the title of the Green Wolf,\r\nand donned a peculiar costume consisting of a long green mantle and\r\na very tall green hat of a conical shape and without a brim. Thus\r\narrayed he stalked solemnly at the head of the brothers, chanting\r\nthe hymn of St. John, the crucifix and holy banner leading the way,\r\nto a place called Chouquet. Here the procession was met by the\r\npriest, precentors, and choir, who conducted the brotherhood to the\r\nparish church. After hearing mass the company adjourned to the house\r\nof the Green Wolf, where a simple repast was served up to them. At\r\nnight a bonfire was kindled to the sound of hand-bells by a young\r\nman and a young woman, both decked with flowers. Then the Green Wolf\r\nand his brothers, with their hoods down on their shoulders and\r\nholding each other by the hand, ran round the fire after the man who\r\nhad been chosen to be the Green Wolf of the following year. Though\r\nonly the first and the last man of the chain had a hand free, their\r\nbusiness was to surround and seize thrice the future Green Wolf, who\r\nin his efforts to escape belaboured the brothers with a long wand\r\nwhich he carried. When at last they succeeded in catching him they\r\ncarried him to the burning pile and made as if they would throw him\r\non it. This ceremony over, they returned to the house of the Green\r\nWolf, where a supper, still of the most meagre fare, was set before\r\nthem. Up till midnight a sort of religious solemnity prevailed. But\r\nat the stroke of twelve all this was changed. Constraint gave way to\r\nlicense; pious hymns were replaced by Bacchanalian ditties, and the\r\nshrill quavering notes of the village fiddle hardly rose above the\r\nroar of voices that went up from the merry brotherhood of the Green\r\nWolf. Next day, the twenty-fourth of June or Midsummer Day, was\r\ncelebrated by the same personages with the same noisy gaiety. One of\r\nthe ceremonies consisted in parading, to the sound of musketry, an\r\nenormous loaf of consecrated bread, which, rising in tiers, was\r\nsurmounted by a pyramid of verdure adorned with ribbons. After that\r\nthe holy hand-bells, deposited on the step of the altar, were\r\nentrusted as insignia of office to the man who was to be the Green\r\nWolf next year.\r\n\r\nAt Ch\xe2teau-Thierry, in the department of Aisne, the custom of\r\nlighting bonfires and dancing round them at the midsummer festival\r\nof St. John lasted down to about 1850; the fires were kindled\r\nespecially when June had been rainy, and the people thought that the\r\nlighting of the bonfires would cause the rain to cease. In the\r\nVosges it is still customary to kindle bonfires upon the hill-tops\r\non Midsummer Eve; the people believe that the fires help to preserve\r\nthe fruits of the earth and ensure good crops.\r\n\r\nBonfires were lit in almost all the hamlets of Poitou on the Eve of\r\nSt. John. People marched round them thrice, carrying a branch of\r\nwalnut in their hand. Shepherdesses and children passed sprigs of\r\nmullein (_verbascum_) and nuts across the flames; the nuts were\r\nsupposed to cure toothache, and the mullein to protect the cattle\r\nfrom sickness and sorcery. When the fire died down people took some\r\nof the ashes home with them, either to keep them in the house as a\r\npreservative against thunder or to scatter them on the fields for\r\nthe purpose of destroying corn-cockles and darnel. In Poitou also it\r\nused to be customary on the Eve of St. John to trundle a blazing\r\nwheel wrapt in straw over the fields to fertilise them.\r\n\r\nIn the mountainous part of Comminges, a province of Southern France,\r\nthe midsummer fire is made by splitting open the trunk of a tall\r\ntree, stuffing the crevice with shavings, and igniting the whole. A\r\ngarland of flowers is fastened to the top of the tree, and at the\r\nmoment when the fire is lighted the man who was last married has to\r\nclimb up a ladder and bring the flowers down. In the flat parts of\r\nthe same district the materials of the midsummer bonfires consist of\r\nfuel piled in the usual way; but they must be put together by men\r\nwho have been married since the last midsummer festival, and each of\r\nthese benedicts is obliged to lay a wreath of flowers on the top of\r\nthe pile.\r\n\r\nIn Provence the midsummer fires are still popular. Children go from\r\ndoor to door begging for fuel, and they are seldom sent empty away.\r\nFormerly the priest, the mayor, and the aldermen used to walk in\r\nprocession to the bonfire, and even deigned to light it; after which\r\nthe assembly marched thrice round the burning pile. At Aix a nominal\r\nking, chosen from among the youth for his skill in shooting at a\r\npopinjay, presided over the midsummer festival. He selected his own\r\nofficers, and escorted by a brilliant train marched to the bonfire,\r\nkindled it, and was the first to dance round it. Next day he\r\ndistributed largesse to his followers. His reign lasted a year,\r\nduring which he enjoyed certain privileges. He was allowed to attend\r\nthe mass celebrated by the commander of the Knights of St. John on\r\nSt. John\'s Day; the right of hunting was accorded to him, and\r\nsoldiers might not be quartered in his house. At Marseilles also on\r\nthis day one of the guilds chose a king of the _badache_ or double\r\naxe; but it does not appear that he kindled the bonfire, which is\r\nsaid to have been lighted with great ceremony by the pr\xe9fet and\r\nother authorities.\r\n\r\nIn Belgium the custom of kindling the midsummer bonfires has long\r\ndisappeared from the great cities, but it is still kept up in rural\r\ndistricts and small towns. In that country the Eve of St. Peter\'s\r\nDay (the twenty-ninth of June) is celebrated by bonfires and dances\r\nexactly like those which commemorate St. John\'s Eve. Some people say\r\nthat the fires of St. Peter, like those of St. John, are lighted in\r\norder to drive away dragons. In French Flanders down to 1789 a straw\r\nfigure representing a man was always burned in the midsummer\r\nbonfire, and the figure of a woman was burned on St. Peter\'s Day,\r\nthe twenty-ninth of June. In Belgium people jump over the midsummer\r\nbonfires as a preventive of colic, and they keep the ashes at home\r\nto hinder fire from breaking out.\r\n\r\nThe custom of lighting bonfires at midsummer has been observed in\r\nmany parts of our own country, and as usual people danced round and\r\nleaped over them. In Wales three or nine different kinds of wood and\r\ncharred faggots carefully preserved from the last midsummer were\r\ndeemed necessary to build the bonfire, which was generally done on\r\nrising ground. In the Vale of Glamorgan a cart-wheel swathed in\r\nstraw used to be ignited and sent rolling down the hill. If it kept\r\nalight all the way down and blazed for a long time, an abundant\r\nharvest was expected. On Midsummer Eve people in the Isle of Man\r\nwere wont to light fires to the windward of every field, so that the\r\nsmoke might pass over the corn; and they folded their cattle and\r\ncarried blazing furze or gorse round them several times. In Ireland\r\ncattle, especially barren cattle, were driven through the midsummer\r\nfires, and the ashes were thrown on the fields to fertilise them, or\r\nlive coals were carried into them to prevent blight. In Scotland the\r\ntraces of midsummer fires are few; but at that season in the\r\nhighlands of Perthshire cowherds used to go round their folds\r\nthrice, in the direction of the sun, with lighted torches. This they\r\ndid to purify the flocks and herds and to keep them from falling\r\nsick.\r\n\r\nThe practice of lighting bonfires on Midsummer Eve and dancing or\r\nleaping over them is, or was till recently, common all over Spain\r\nand in some parts of Italy and Sicily. In Malta great fires are\r\nkindled in the streets and squares of the towns and villages on the\r\nEve of St. John (Midsummer Eve); formerly the Grand Master of the\r\nOrder of St. John used on that evening to set fire to a heap of\r\npitch barrels placed in front of the sacred Hospital. In Greece,\r\ntoo, the custom of kindling fires on St. John\'s Eve and jumping over\r\nthem is said to be still universal. One reason assigned for it is a\r\nwish to escape from the fleas. According to another account, the\r\nwomen cry out, as they leap over the fire, "I leave my sins behind\r\nme." In Lesbos the fires on St. John\'s Eve are usually lighted by\r\nthrees, and the people spring thrice over them, each with a stone on\r\nhis head, saying, "I jump the hare\'s fire, my head a stone!" In\r\nCalymnos the midsummer fire is supposed to ensure abundance in the\r\ncoming year as well as deliverance from fleas. The people dance\r\nround the fires singing, with stones on their heads, and then jump\r\nover the blaze or the glowing embers. When the fire is burning low,\r\nthey throw the stones into it; and when it is nearly out, they make\r\ncrosses on their legs and then go straightway and bathe in the sea.\r\n\r\nThe custom of kindling bonfires on Midsummer Day or on Midsummer Eve\r\nis widely spread among the Mohammedan peoples of North Africa,\r\nparticularly in Morocco and Algeria; it is common both to the\r\nBerbers and to many of the Arabs or Arabic-speaking tribes. In these\r\ncountries Midsummer Day (the twenty-fourth of June, Old Style) is\r\ncalled _l\'\xe1nsara._ The fires are lit in the courtyards, at\r\ncross-roads, in the fields, and sometimes on the threshing-floors.\r\nPlants which in burning give out a thick smoke and an aromatic smell\r\nare much sought after for fuel on these occasions; among the plants\r\nused for the purpose are giant-fennel, thyme, rue, chervil-seed,\r\ncamomile, geranium, and penny-royal. People expose themselves, and\r\nespecially their children, to the smoke, and drive it towards the\r\norchards and the crops. Also they leap across the fires; in some\r\nplaces everybody ought to repeat the leap seven times. Moreover they\r\ntake burning brands from the fires and carry them through the houses\r\nin order to fumigate them. They pass things through the fire, and\r\nbring the sick into contact with it, while they utter prayers for\r\ntheir recovery. The ashes of the bonfires are also reputed to\r\npossess beneficial properties; hence in some places people rub their\r\nhair or their bodies with them. In some places they think that by\r\nleaping over the fires they rid themselves of all misfortune, and\r\nthat childless couples thereby obtain offspring. Berbers of the Rif\r\nprovince, in Northern Morocco, make great use of fires at midsummer\r\nfor the good of themselves, their cattle, and their fruit-trees.\r\nThey jump over the bonfires in the belief that this will preserve\r\nthem in good health, and they light fires under fruit-trees to keep\r\nthe fruit from falling untimely. And they imagine that by rubbing a\r\npaste of the ashes on their hair they prevent the hair from falling\r\noff their heads. In all these Moroccan customs, we are told, the\r\nbeneficial effect is attributed wholly to the smoke, which is\r\nsupposed to be endued with a magical quality that removes misfortune\r\nfrom men, animals, fruit-trees and crops.\r\n\r\nThe celebration of a midsummer festival by Mohammedan peoples is\r\nparticularly remarkable, because the Mohammedan calendar, being\r\npurely lunar and uncorrected by intercalation, necessarily takes no\r\nnote of festivals which occupy fixed points in the solar year; all\r\nstrictly Mohammedan feasts, being pinned to the moon, slide\r\ngradually with that luminary through the whole period of the earth\'s\r\nrevolution about the sun. This fact of itself seems to prove that\r\namong the Mohammedan peoples of Northern Africa, as among the\r\nChristian peoples of Europe, the midsummer festival is quite\r\nindependent of the religion which the people publicly profess, and\r\nis a relic of a far older paganism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. The Hallowe\'en Fires\r\n\r\nFROM THE FOREGOING survey we may infer that among the heathen\r\nforefathers of the European peoples the most popular and widespread\r\nfire-festival of the year was the great celebration of Midsummer Eve\r\nor Midsummer Day. The coincidence of the festival with the summer\r\nsolstice can hardly be accidental. Rather we must suppose that our\r\npagan ancestors purposely timed the ceremony of fire on earth to\r\ncoincide with the arrival of the sun at the highest point of his\r\ncourse in the sky. If that was so, it follows that the old founders\r\nof the midsummer rites had observed the solstices or turning-points\r\nof the sun\'s apparent path in the sky, and that they accordingly\r\nregulated their festal calendar to some extent by astronomical\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nBut while this may be regarded as fairly certain for what we may\r\ncall the aborigines throughout a large part of the continent, it\r\nappears not to have been true of the Celtic peoples who inhabited\r\nthe Land\'s End of Europe, the islands and promontories that stretch\r\nout into the Atlantic Ocean on the North-West. The principal\r\nfire-festivals of the Celts, which have survived, though in a\r\nrestricted area and with diminished pomp, to modern times and even\r\nto our own day, were seemingly timed without any reference to the\r\nposition of the sun in the heaven. They were two in number, and fell\r\nat an interval of six months, one being celebrated on the eve of May\r\nDay and the other on Allhallow Even or Hallowe\'en, as it is now\r\ncommonly called, that is, on the thirty-first of October, the day\r\npreceding All Saints\' or Allhallows\' Day. These dates coincide with\r\nnone of the four great hinges on which the solar year revolves, to\r\nwit, the solstices and the equinoxes. Nor do they agree with the\r\nprincipal seasons of the agricultural year, the sowing in spring and\r\nthe reaping in autumn. For when May Day comes, the seed has long\r\nbeen committed to the earth; and when November opens, the harvest\r\nhas long been reaped and garnered, the fields lie bare, the\r\nfruit-trees are stripped, and even the yellow leaves are fast\r\nfluttering to the ground. Yet the first of May and the first of\r\nNovember mark turning-points of the year in Europe; the one ushers\r\nin the genial heat and the rich vegetation of summer, the other\r\nheralds, if it does not share, the cold and barrenness of winter.\r\nNow these particular points of the year, as has been well pointed\r\nout by a learned and ingenious writer, while they are of\r\ncomparatively little moment to the European husbandman, do deeply\r\nconcern the European herdsman; for it is on the approach of summer\r\nthat he drives his cattle out into the open to crop the fresh grass,\r\nand it is on the approach of winter that he leads them back to the\r\nsafety and shelter of the stall. Accordingly it seems not improbable\r\nthat the Celtic bisection of the year into two halves at the\r\nbeginning of May and the beginning of November dates from a time\r\nwhen the Celts were mainly a pastoral people, dependent for their\r\nsubsistence on their herds, and when accordingly the great epochs of\r\nthe year for them were the days on which the cattle went forth from\r\nthe homestead in early summer and returned to it again in early\r\nwinter. Even in Central Europe, remote from the region now occupied\r\nby the Celts, a similar bisection of the year may be clearly traced\r\nin the great popularity, on the one hand, of May Day and its Eve\r\n(Walpurgis Night), and, on the other hand, of the Feast of All Souls\r\nat the beginning of November, which under a thin Christian cloak\r\nconceals an ancient pagan festival of the dead. Hence we may\r\nconjecture that everywhere throughout Europe the celestial division\r\nof the year according to the solstices was preceded by what we may\r\ncall a terrestrial division of the year according to the beginning\r\nof summer and the beginning of winter.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, the two great Celtic festivals of May Day and the\r\nfirst of November or, to be more accurate, the Eves of these two\r\ndays, closely resemble each other in the manner of their celebration\r\nand in the superstitions associated with them, and alike, by the\r\nantique character impressed upon both, betray a remote and purely\r\npagan origin. The festival of May Day or Beltane, as the Celts\r\ncalled it, which ushered in summer, has already been described; it\r\nremains to give some account of the corresponding festival of\r\nHallowe\'en, which announced the arrival of winter.\r\n\r\nOf the two feasts Hallowe\'en was perhaps of old the more important,\r\nsince the Celts would seem to have dated the beginning of the year\r\nfrom it rather than from Beltane. In the Isle of Man, one of the\r\nfortresses in which the Celtic language and lore longest held out\r\nagainst the siege of the Saxon invaders, the first of November, Old\r\nStyle, has been regarded as New Year\'s day down to recent times.\r\nThus Manx mummers used to go round on Hallowe\'en (Old Style),\r\nsinging, in the Manx language, a sort of Hogmanay song which began\r\n"To-night is New Year\'s Night, _Hogunnaa!_" In ancient Ireland, a\r\nnew fire used to be kindled every year on Hallowe\'en or the Eve of\r\nSamhain, and from this sacred flame all the fires in Ireland were\r\nrekindled. Such a custom points strongly to Samhain or All Saints\'\r\nDay (the first of November) as New Year\'s Day; since the annual\r\nkindling of a new fire takes place most naturally at the beginning\r\nof the year, in order that the blessed influence of the fresh fire\r\nmay last throughout the whole period of twelve months. Another\r\nconfirmation of the view that the Celts dated their year from the\r\nfirst of November is furnished by the manifold modes of divination\r\nwhich were commonly resorted to by Celtic peoples on Hallowe\'en for\r\nthe purpose of ascertaining their destiny, especially their fortune\r\nin the coming year; for when could these devices for prying into the\r\nfuture be more reasonably put in practice than at the beginning of\r\nthe year? As a season of omens and auguries Hallowe\'en seems to have\r\nfar surpassed Beltane in the imagination of the Celts; from which we\r\nmay with some probability infer that they reckoned their year from\r\nHallowe\'en rather than Beltane. Another circumstance of great moment\r\nwhich points to the same conclusion is the association of the dead\r\nwith Hallowe\'en. Not only among the Celts but throughout Europe,\r\nHallowe\'en, the night which marks the transition from autumn to\r\nwinter, seems to have been of old the time of year when the souls of\r\nthe departed were supposed to revisit their old homes in order to\r\nwarm themselves by the fire and to comfort themselves with the good\r\ncheer provided for them in the kitchen or the parlour by their\r\naffectionate kinsfolk. It was, perhaps, a natural thought that the\r\napproach of winter should drive the poor shivering hungry ghosts\r\nfrom the bare fields and the leafless woodlands to the shelter of\r\nthe cottage with its familiar fireside. Did not the lowing kine then\r\ntroop back from the summer pastures in the forests and on the hills\r\nto be fed and cared for in the stalls, while the bleak winds\r\nwhistled among the swaying boughs and the snow-drifts deepened in\r\nthe hollows? and could the good-man and the good-wife deny to the\r\nspirits of their dead the welcome which they gave to the cows?\r\n\r\nBut it is not only the souls of the departed who are supposed to be\r\nhovering unseen on the day "when autumn to winter resigns the pale\r\nyear." Witches then speed on their errands of mischief, some\r\nsweeping through the air on besoms, others galloping along the roads\r\non tabby-cats, which for that evening are turned into coal-black\r\nsteeds. The fairies, too, are all let loose, and hobgoblins of every\r\nsort roam freely about.\r\n\r\nYet while a glamour of mystery and awe has always clung to\r\nHallowe\'en in the minds of the Celtic peasantry, the popular\r\ncelebration of the festival has been, at least in modern times, by\r\nno means of a prevailing gloomy cast; on the contrary it has been\r\nattended by picturesque features and merry pastimes, which rendered\r\nit the gayest night of all the year. Amongst the things which in the\r\nHighlands of Scotland contributed to invest the festival with a\r\nromantic beauty were the bonfires which used to blaze at frequent\r\nintervals on the heights. "On the last day of autumn children\r\ngathered ferns, tar-barrels, the long thin stalks called _g\xe0inisg,_\r\nand everything suitable for a bonfire. These were placed in a heap\r\non some eminence near the house, and in the evening set fire to. The\r\nfires were called _Samhnagan._ There was one for each house, and it\r\nwas an object of ambition who should have the biggest. Whole\r\ndistricts were brilliant with bonfires, and their glare across a\r\nHighland loch, and from many eminences, formed an exceedingly\r\npicturesque scene." Like the Beltane fires on the first of May, the\r\nHallowe\'en bonfires seem to have been kindled most commonly in the\r\nPerthshire Highlands. In the parish of Callander they still blazed\r\ndown to near the end of the eighteenth century. When the fire had\r\ndied down, the ashes were carefully collected in the form of a\r\ncircle, and a stone was put in, near the circumference, for every\r\nperson of the several families interested in the bonfire. Next\r\nmorning, if any of these stones was found to be displaced or\r\ninjured, the people made sure that the person represented by it was\r\n_fey_ or devoted, and that he could not live twelve months from that\r\nday. At Balquhidder down to the latter part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury each household kindled its bonfire at Hallowe\'en, but the\r\ncustom was chiefly observed by children. The fires were lighted on\r\nany high knoll near the house; there was no dancing round them.\r\nHallowe\'en fires were also lighted in some districts of the\r\nnorth-east of Scotland, such as Buchan. Villagers and farmers alike\r\nmust have their fire. In the villages the boys went from house to\r\nhouse and begged a peat from each householder, usually with the\r\nwords, "Ge\'s a peat t\' burn the witches." When they had collected\r\nenough peats, they piled them in a heap, together with straw, furze,\r\nand other combustible materials, and set the whole on fire. Then\r\neach of the youths, one after another, laid himself down on the\r\nground as near to the fire as he could without being scorched, and\r\nthus lying allowed the smoke to roll over him. The others ran\r\nthrough the smoke and jumped over their prostrate comrade. When the\r\nheap was burned down, they scattered the ashes, vying with each\r\nother who should scatter them most.\r\n\r\nIn the northern part of Wales it used to be customary for every\r\nfamily to make a great bonfire called _Coel Coeth_ on Hallowe\'en.\r\nThe fire was kindled on the most conspicuous spot near the house;\r\nand when it had nearly gone out every one threw into the ashes a\r\nwhite stone, which he had first marked. Then having said their\r\nprayers round the fire, they went to bed. Next morning, as soon as\r\nthey were up, they came to search out the stones, and if any one of\r\nthem was found to be missing, they had a notion that the person who\r\nthrew it would die before he saw another Hallowe\'en. According to\r\nSir John Rhys, the habit of celebrating Hallowe\'en by lighting\r\nbonfires on the hills is perhaps not yet extinct in Wales, and men\r\nstill living can remember how the people who assisted at the\r\nbonfires would wait till the last spark was out and then would\r\nsuddenly take to their heels, shouting at the top of their voices,\r\n"The cropped black sow seize the hindmost!" The saying, as Sir John\r\nRhys justly remarks, implies that originally one of the company\r\nbecame a victim in dead earnest. Down to the present time the saying\r\nis current in Carnarvonshire, where allusions to the cutty black sow\r\nare still occasionally made to frighten children. We can now\r\nunderstand why in Lower Brittany every person throws a pebble into\r\nthe midsummer bonfire. Doubtless there, as in Wales and the\r\nHighlands of Scotland, omens of life and death have at one time or\r\nother been drawn from the position and state of the pebbles on the\r\nmorning of All Saints\' Day. The custom, thus found among three\r\nseparate branches of the Celtic stock, probably dates from a period\r\nbefore their dispersion, or at least from a time when alien races\r\nhad not yet driven home the wedges of separation between them.\r\n\r\nIn the Isle of Man also, another Celtic country, Hallowe\'en was\r\ncelebrated down to modern times by the kindling of fires,\r\naccompanied with all the usual ceremonies designed to prevent the\r\nbaneful influence of fairies and witches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7. The Midwinter Fires\r\n\r\nIF THE HEATHEN of ancient Europe celebrated, as we have good reason\r\nto believe, the season of Midsummer with a great festival of fire,\r\nof which the traces have survived in many places down to our own\r\ntime, it is natural to suppose that they should have observed with\r\nsimilar rites the corresponding season of Midwinter; for Midsummer\r\nand Midwinter, or, in more technical language, the summer solstice\r\nand the winter solstice, are the two great turningpoints in the\r\nsun\'s apparent course through the sky, and from the standpoint of\r\nprimitive man nothing might seem more appropriate than to kindle\r\nfires on earth at the two moments when the fire and heat of the\r\ngreat luminary in heaven begin to wane or to wax.\r\n\r\nIn modern Christendom the ancient fire-festival of the winter\r\nsolstice appears to survive, or to have survived down to recent\r\nyears, in the old custom of the Yule log, clog, or block, as it was\r\nvariously called in England. The custom was widespread in Europe,\r\nbut seems to have flourished especially in England, France, and\r\namong the South Slavs; at least the fullest accounts of the custom\r\ncome from these quarters. That the Yule log was only the winter\r\ncounterpart of the midsummer bonfire, kindled within doors instead\r\nof in the open air on account of the cold and inclement weather of\r\nthe season, was pointed out long ago by our English antiquary John\r\nBrand; and the view is supported by the many quaint superstitions\r\nattaching to the Yule log, superstitions which have no apparent\r\nconnexion with Christianity but carry their heathen origin plainly\r\nstamped upon them. But while the two solstitial celebrations were\r\nboth festivals of fire, the necessity or desirability of holding the\r\nwinter celebration within doors lent it the character of a private\r\nor domestic festivity, which contrasts strongly with the publicity\r\nof the summer celebration, at which the people gathered on some open\r\nspace or conspicuous height, kindled a huge bonfire in common, and\r\ndanced and made merry round it together.\r\n\r\nDown to about the middle of the nineteenth century the old rite of\r\nthe Yule log was kept up in some parts of Central Germany. Thus in\r\nthe valleys of the Sieg and Lahn the Yule log, a heavy block of oak,\r\nwas fitted into the floor of the hearth, where, though it glowed\r\nunder the fire, it was hardly reduced to ashes within a year. When\r\nthe new log was laid next year, the remains of the old one were\r\nground to powder and strewed over the fields during the Twelve\r\nNights, which was supposed to promote the growth of the crops. In\r\nsome villages of Westphalia, the practice was to withdraw the Yule\r\nlog (_Christbrand_) from the fire so soon as it was slightly\r\ncharred; it was then kept carefully to be replaced on the fire\r\nwhenever a thunderstorm broke, because the people believed that\r\nlightning would not strike a house in which the Yule log was\r\nsmouldering. In other villages of Westphalia the old custom was to\r\ntie up the Yule log in the last sheaf cut at harvest.\r\n\r\nIn several provinces of France, and particularly in Provence, the\r\ncustom of the Yule log or _tr\xe9foir,_ as it was called in many\r\nplaces, was long observed. A French writer of the seventeenth\r\ncentury denounces as superstitious "the belief that a log called the\r\n_tr\xe9foir_ or Christmas brand, which you put on the fire for the\r\nfirst time on Christmas Eve and continue to put on the fire for a\r\nlittle while every day till Twelfth Night, can, if kept under the\r\nbed, protect the house for a whole year from fire and thunder; that\r\nit can prevent the inmates from having chilblains on their heels in\r\nwinter; that it can cure the cattle of many maladies; that if a\r\npiece of it be steeped in the water which cows drink it helps them\r\nto calve; and lastly that if the ashes of the log be strewn on the\r\nfields it can save the wheat from mildew."\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Flanders and France the remains of the Yule log\r\nwere regularly kept in the house under a bed as a protection against\r\nthunder and lightning; in Berry, when thunder was heard, a member of\r\nthe family used to take a piece of the log and throw it on the fire,\r\nwhich was believed to avert the lightning. Again, in Perigord, the\r\ncharcoal and ashes are carefully collected and kept for healing\r\nswollen glands; the part of the trunk which has not been burnt in\r\nthe fire is used by ploughmen to make the wedge for their plough,\r\nbecause they allege that it causes the seeds to thrive better; and\r\nthe women keep pieces of it till Twelfth Night for the sake of their\r\nchickens. Some people imagine that they will have as many chickens\r\nas there are sparks that fly out of the brands of the log when they\r\nshake them; and others place the extinct brands under the bed to\r\ndrive away vermin. In various parts of France the charred log is\r\nthought to guard the house against sorcery as well as against\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nIn England the customs and beliefs concerning the Yule log used to\r\nbe similar. On the night of Christmas Eve, says the antiquary John\r\nBrand, "our ancestors were wont to light up candles of an uncommon\r\nsize, called Christmas Candles, and lay a log of wood upon the fire,\r\ncalled a Yule-clog or Christmas-block, to illuminate the house, and,\r\nas it were, to turn night into day." The old custom was to light the\r\nYule log with a fragment of its predecessor, which had been kept\r\nthroughout the year for the purpose; where it was so kept, the fiend\r\ncould do no mischief. The remains of the log were also supposed to\r\nguard the house against fire and lightning.\r\n\r\nTo this day the ritual of bringing in the Yule log is observed with\r\nmuch solemnity among the Southern Slavs, especially the Serbians.\r\nThe log is usually a block of oak, but sometimes of olive or beech.\r\nThey seem to think that they will have as many calves, lambs, pigs,\r\nand kids as they strike sparks out of the burning log. Some people\r\ncarry a piece of the log out to the fields to protect them against\r\nhail. In Albania down to recent years it was a common custom to burn\r\na Yule log at Christmas, and the ashes of the fire were scattered on\r\nthe fields to make them fertile. The Huzuls, a Slavonic people of\r\nthe Carpathians, kindle fire by the friction of wood on Christmas\r\nEve (Old Style, the fifth of January) and keep it burning till\r\nTwelfth Night.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how common the belief appears to have been that the\r\nremains of the Yule log, if kept throughout the year, had power to\r\nprotect the house against fire and especially against lightning. As\r\nthe Yule log was frequently of oak, it seems possible that this\r\nbelief may be a relic of the old Aryan creed which associated the\r\noak-tree with the god of thunder. Whether the curative and\r\nfertilising virtues ascribed to the ashes of the Yule log, which are\r\nsupposed to heal cattle as well as men, to enable cows to calve, and\r\nto promote the fruitfulness of the earth, may not be derived from\r\nthe same ancient source, is a question which deserves to be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8. The Need-fire\r\n\r\nTHE FIRE-FESTIVALS hitherto described are all celebrated\r\nperiodically at certain stated times of the year. But besides these\r\nregularly recurring celebrations the peasants in many parts of\r\nEurope have been wont from time immemorial to resort to a ritual of\r\nfire at irregular intervals in seasons of distress and calamity,\r\nabove all when their cattle were attacked by epidemic disease. No\r\naccount of the popular European fire-festivals would be complete\r\nwithout some notice of these remarkable rites, which have all the\r\ngreater claim on our attention because they may perhaps be regarded\r\nas the source and origin of all the other fire-festivals; certainly\r\nthey must date from a very remote antiquity. The general name by\r\nwhich they are known among the Teutonic peoples is need-fire.\r\nSometimes the need-fire was known as "wild fire," to distinguish it\r\nno doubt from the tame fire produced by more ordinary methods. Among\r\nSlavonic peoples it is called "living fire."\r\n\r\nThe history of the custom can be traced from the early Middle Ages,\r\nwhen it was denounced by the Church as a heathen superstition, down\r\nto the first half of the nineteenth century, when it was still\r\noccasionally practised in various parts of Germany, England,\r\nScotland, and Ireland. Among Slavonic peoples it appears to have\r\nlingered even longer. The usual occasion for performing the rite was\r\nan outbreak of plague or cattle-disease, for which the need-fire was\r\nbelieved to be an infallible remedy. The animals which were\r\nsubjected to it included cows, pigs, horses, and sometimes geese. As\r\na necessary preliminary to the kindling of the need-fire all other\r\nfires and lights in the neighbourhood were extinguished, so that not\r\nso much as a spark remained alight; for so long as even a\r\nnight-light burned in a house, it was imagined that the need-fire\r\ncould not kindle. Sometimes it was deemed enough to put out all the\r\nfires in the village; but sometimes the extinction extended to\r\nneighbouring villages or to a whole parish. In some parts of the\r\nHighlands of Scotland the rule was that all householders who dwelt\r\nwithin the two nearest running streams should put out their lights\r\nand fires on the day appointed. Usually the need-fire was made in\r\nthe open air, but in some parts of Serbia it was kindled in a dark\r\nroom; sometimes the place was a cross-way or a hollow in a road. In\r\nthe Highlands of Scotland the proper places for performing the rite\r\nseem to have been knolls or small islands in rivers.\r\n\r\nThe regular method of producing the need-fire was by the friction of\r\ntwo pieces of wood; it might not be struck by flint and steel. Very\r\nexceptionally among some South Slavs we read of a practice of\r\nkindling a need-fire by striking a piece of iron on an anvil. Where\r\nthe wood to be employed is specified, it is generally said to be\r\noak; but on the Lower Rhine the fire was kindled by the friction of\r\noak-wood or fir-wood. In Slavonic countries we hear of poplar, pear,\r\nand cornel wood being used for the purpose. Often the material is\r\nsimply described as two pieces of dry wood. Sometimes nine different\r\nkinds of wood were deemed necessary, but rather perhaps to be burned\r\nin the bonfire than to be rubbed together for the production of the\r\nneed-fire. The particular mode of kindling the need-fire varied in\r\ndifferent districts; a very common one was this. Two poles were\r\ndriven into the ground about a foot and a half from each other. Each\r\npole had in the side facing the other a socket into which a smooth\r\ncross-piece or roller was fitted. The sockets were stuffed with\r\nlinen, and the two ends of the roller were rammed tightly into the\r\nsockets. To make it more inflammable the roller was often coated\r\nwith tar. A rope was then wound round the roller, and the free ends\r\nat both sides were gripped by two or more persons, who by pulling\r\nthe rope to and fro caused the roller to revolve rapidly, till\r\nthrough the friction the linen in the sockets took fire. The sparks\r\nwere immediately caught in tow or oakum and waved about in a circle\r\nuntil they burst into a bright glow, when straw was applied to it,\r\nand the blazing straw used to kindle the fuel that had been stacked\r\nto make the bonfire. Often a wheel, sometimes a cart-wheel or even a\r\nspinning-wheel, formed part of the mechanism; in Aberdeenshire it\r\nwas called "the muckle wheel"; in the island of Mull the wheel was\r\nturned from east to west over nine spindles of oak-wood. Sometimes\r\nwe are merely told that two wooden planks were rubbed together.\r\nSometimes it was prescribed that the cart-wheel used for fire-making\r\nand the axle on which it turned should both be new. Similarly it was\r\nsaid that the rope which turned the roller should be new; if\r\npossible it should be woven of strands taken from a gallows rope\r\nwith which people had been hanged, but this was a counsel of\r\nperfection rather than a strict necessity.\r\n\r\nVarious rules were also laid down as to the kind of persons who\r\nmight or should make the need-fire. Sometimes it was said that the\r\ntwo persons who pulled the rope which twirled the roller should\r\nalways be brothers or at least bear the same baptismal name;\r\nsometimes it was deemed sufficient if they were both chaste young\r\nmen. In some villages of Brunswick people thought that if everybody\r\nwho lent a hand in kindling the need-fire did not bear the same\r\nChristian name, they would labour in vain. In Silesia the tree\r\nemployed to produce the need-fire used to be felled by a pair of\r\ntwin brothers. In the western islands of Scotland the fire was\r\nkindled by eighty-one married men, who rubbed two great planks\r\nagainst each other, working in relays of nine; in North Uist the\r\nnine times nine who made the fire were all first-begotten sons, but\r\nwe are not told whether they were married or single. Among the\r\nSerbians the need-fire is sometimes kindled by a boy and girl\r\nbetween eleven and fourteen years of age, who work stark naked in a\r\ndark room; sometimes it is made by an old man and an old woman also\r\nin the dark. In Bulgaria, too, the makers of need-fire strip\r\nthemselves of their clothes; in Caithness they divested themselves\r\nof all kinds of metal. If after long rubbing of the wood no fire was\r\nelicited they concluded that some fire must still be burning in the\r\nvillage; so a strict search was made from house to house, any fire\r\nthat might be found was put out, and the negligent householder\r\npunished or upbraided; indeed a heavy fine might be inflicted on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhen the need-fire was at last kindled, the bonfire was lit from it,\r\nand as soon as the blaze had somewhat died down, the sick animals\r\nwere driven over the glowing embers, sometimes in a regular order of\r\nprecedence, first the pigs, next the cows, and last of all the\r\nhorses. Sometimes they were driven twice or thrice through the smoke\r\nand flames, so that occasionally some of them were scorched to\r\ndeath. As soon as all the beasts were through, the young folk would\r\nrush wildly at the ashes and cinders, sprinkling and blackening each\r\nother with them; those who were most blackened would march in\r\ntriumph behind the cattle into the village and would not wash\r\nthemselves for a long time. From the bonfire people carried live\r\nembers home and used them to rekindle the fires in their houses.\r\nThese brands, after being extinguished in water, they sometimes put\r\nin the managers at which the cattle fed, and kept them there for a\r\nwhile. Ashes from the need-fire were also strewed on the fields to\r\nprotect the crops against vermin; sometimes they were taken home to\r\nbe employed as remedies in sickness, being sprinkled on the ailing\r\npart or mixed in water and drunk by the patient. In the western\r\nislands of Scotland and on the adjoining mainland, as soon as the\r\nfire on the domestic hearth had been rekindled from the need-fire a\r\npot full of water was set on it, and the water thus heated was\r\nafterwards sprinkled upon the people infected with the plague or\r\nupon the cattle that were tainted by the murrain. Special virtue was\r\nattributed to the smoke of the bonfire; in Sweden fruit-trees and\r\nnets were fumigated with it, in order that the trees might bear\r\nfruit and the nets catch fish. In the Highlands of Scotland the\r\nneed-fire was accounted a sovereign remedy for witchcraft. In the\r\nisland of Mull, when the fire was kindled as a cure for the murrain,\r\nwe hear of the rite being accompanied by the sacrifice of a sick\r\nheifer, which was cut in pieces and burnt. Slavonian and Bulgarian\r\npeasants conceive cattle-plague as a foul fiend or vampyre which can\r\nbe kept at bay by interposing a barrier of fire between it and the\r\nherds. A similar conception may perhaps have originally everywhere\r\nunderlain the use of the need-fire as a remedy for the murrain. It\r\nappears that in some parts of Germany the people did not wait for an\r\noutbreak of cattleplague, but, taking time by the forelock, kindled\r\na need-fire annually to prevent the calamity. Similarly in Poland\r\nthe peasants are said to kindle fires in the village streets every\r\nyear on St. Rochus\'s day and to drive the cattle thrice through them\r\nin order to protect the beasts against the murrain. We have seen\r\nthat in the Hebrides the cattle were in like manner driven annually\r\nround the Beltane fires for the same purpose. In some cantons of\r\nSwitzerland children still kindle a need-fire by the friction of\r\nwood for the sake of dispelling a mist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIII. The Interpretation of the Fire-Festivals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. On the Fire-festivals in general\r\n\r\nTHE FOREGOING survey of the popular fire-festivals of Europe\r\nsuggests some general observations. In the first place we can hardly\r\nhelp being struck by the resemblance which the ceremonies bear to\r\neach other, at whatever time of the year and in whatever part of\r\nEurope they are celebrated. The custom of kindling great bonfires,\r\nleaping over them, and driving cattle through or round them would\r\nseem to have been practically universal throughout Europe, and the\r\nsame may be said of the processions or races with blazing torches\r\nround fields, orchards, pastures, or cattle-stalls. Less widespread\r\nare the customs of hurling lighted discs into the air and trundling\r\na burning wheel down hill. The ceremonial of the Yule log is\r\ndistinguished from that of the other fire-festivals by the privacy\r\nand domesticity which characterise it; but this distinction may well\r\nbe due simply to the rough weather of midwinter, which is apt not\r\nonly to render a public assembly in the open air disagreeable, but\r\nalso at any moment to defeat the object of the assembly by\r\nextinguishing the all-important fire under a downpour of rain or a\r\nfall of snow. Apart from these local or seasonal differences, the\r\ngeneral resemblance between the fire-festivals at all times of the\r\nyear and in all places is tolerably close. And as the ceremonies\r\nthemselves resemble each other, so do the benefits which the people\r\nexpect to reap from them. Whether applied in the form of bonfires\r\nblazing at fixed points, or of torches carried about from place to\r\nplace, or of embers and ashes taken from the smouldering heap of\r\nfuel, the fire is believed to promote the growth of the crops and\r\nthe welfare of man and beast, either positively by stimulating them,\r\nor negatively by averting the dangers and calamities which threaten\r\nthem from such causes as thunder and lightning, conflagration,\r\nblight, mildew, vermin, sterility, disease, and not least of all\r\nwitchcraft.\r\n\r\nBut we naturally ask, How did it come about that benefits so great\r\nand manifold were supposed to be attained by means so simple? In\r\nwhat way did people imagine that they could procure so many goods or\r\navoid so many ills by the application of fire and smoke, of embers\r\nand ashes? Two different explanations of the fire-festivals have\r\nbeen given by modern enquirers. On the one hand it has been held\r\nthat they are sun-charms or magical ceremonies intended, on the\r\nprinciple of imitative magic, to ensure a needful supply of sunshine\r\nfor men, animals, and plants by kindling fires which mimic on earth\r\nthe great source of light and heat in the sky. This was the view of\r\nWilhelm Mannhardt. It may be called the solar theory. On the other\r\nhand it has been maintained that the ceremonial fires have no\r\nnecessary reference to the sun but are simply purificatory in\r\nintention, being designed to burn up and destroy all harmful\r\ninfluences, whether these are conceived in a personal form as\r\nwitches, demons, and monsters, or in an impersonal form as a sort of\r\npervading taint or corruption of the air. This is the view of Dr.\r\nEdward Westermarck and apparently of Professor Eugen Mogk. It may be\r\ncalled the purificatory theory. Obviously the two theories postulate\r\ntwo very different conceptions of the fire which plays the principal\r\npart in the rites. On the one view, the fire, like sunshine in our\r\nlatitude, is a genial creative power which fosters the growth of\r\nplants and the development of all that makes for health and\r\nhappiness; on the other view, the fire is a fierce destructive power\r\nwhich blasts and consumes all the noxious elements, whether\r\nspiritual or material, that menace the life of men, of animals, and\r\nof plants. According to the one theory the fire is a stimulant,\r\naccording to the other it is a disinfectant; on the one view its\r\nvirtue is positive, on the other it is negative.\r\n\r\nYet the two explanations, different as they are in the character\r\nwhich they attribute to the fire, are perhaps not wholly\r\nirreconcilable. If we assume that the fires kindled at these\r\nfestivals were primarily intended to imitate the sun\'s light and\r\nheat, may we not regard the purificatory and disinfecting qualities,\r\nwhich popular opinion certainly appears to have ascribed to them, as\r\nattributes derived directly from the purificatory and disinfecting\r\nqualities of sunshine? In this way we might conclude that, while the\r\nimitation of sunshine in these ceremonies was primary and original,\r\nthe purification attributed to them was secondary and derivative.\r\nSuch a conclusion, occupying an intermediate position between the\r\ntwo opposing theories and recognising an element of truth in both of\r\nthem, was adopted by me in earlier editions of this work; but in the\r\nmeantime Dr. Westermarck has argued powerfully in favour of the\r\npurificatory theory alone, and I am bound to say that his arguments\r\ncarry great weight, and that on a fuller review of the facts the\r\nbalance of evidence seems to me to incline decidedly in his favour.\r\nHowever, the case is not so clear as to justify us in dismissing the\r\nsolar theory without discussion, and accordingly I propose to adduce\r\nthe considerations which tell for it before proceeding to notice\r\nthose which tell against it. A theory which had the support of so\r\nlearned and sagacious an investigator as W. Mannhardt is entitled to\r\na respectful hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Solar Theory of the Fire-festivals\r\n\r\nIN AN EARLIER part of this work we saw that savages resort to charms\r\nfor making sunshine, and it would be no wonder if primitive man in\r\nEurope did the same. Indeed, when we consider the cold and cloudy\r\nclimate of Europe during a great part of the year, we shall find it\r\nnatural that sun-charms should have played a much more prominent\r\npart among the superstitious practices of European peoples than\r\namong those of savages who live nearer the equator and who\r\nconsequently are apt to get in the course of nature more sunshine\r\nthan they want. This view of the festivals may be supported by\r\nvarious arguments drawn partly from their dates, partly from the\r\nnature of the rites, and partly from the influence which they are\r\nbelieved to exert upon the weather and on vegetation.\r\n\r\nFirst, in regard to the dates of the festivals it can be no mere\r\naccident that two of the most important and widely spread of the\r\nfestivals are timed to coincide more or less exactly with the summer\r\nand winter solstices, that is, with the two turning-points in the\r\nsun\'s apparent course in the sky when he reaches respectively his\r\nhighest and his lowest elevation at noon. Indeed with respect to the\r\nmidwinter celebration of Christmas we are not left to conjecture; we\r\nknow from the express testimony of the ancients that it was\r\ninstituted by the church to supersede an old heathen festival of the\r\nbirth of the sun, which was apparently conceived to be born again on\r\nthe shortest day of the year, after which his light and heat were\r\nseen to grow till they attained their full maturity at midsummer.\r\nTherefore it is no very far-fetched conjecture to suppose that the\r\nYule log, which figures so prominently in the popular celebration of\r\nChristmas, was originally designed to help the labouring sun of\r\nmidwinter to rekindle his seemingly expiring light.\r\n\r\nNot only the date of some of the festivals but the manner of their\r\ncelebration suggests a conscious imitation of the sun. The custom of\r\nrolling a burning wheel down a hill, which is often observed at\r\nthese ceremonies, might well pass for an imitation of the sun\'s\r\ncourse in the sky, and the imitation would be especially appropriate\r\non Midsummer Day when the sun\'s annual declension begins. Indeed the\r\ncustom has been thus interpreted by some of those who have recorded\r\nit. Not less graphic, it may be said, is the mimicry of his apparent\r\nrevolution by swinging a burning tar-barrel round a pole. Again, the\r\ncommon practice of throwing fiery discs, sometimes expressly said to\r\nbe shaped like suns, into the air at the festivals may well be a\r\npiece of imitative magic. In these, as in so many cases, the magic\r\nforce may be supposed to take effect through mimicry or sympathy: by\r\nimitating the desired result you actually produce it: by\r\ncounterfeiting the sun\'s progress through the heavens you really\r\nhelp the luminary to pursue his celestial journey with punctuality\r\nand despatch. The name "fire of heaven," by which the midsummer fire\r\nis sometimes popularly known, clearly implies a consciousness of a\r\nconnexion between the earthly and the heavenly flame.\r\n\r\nAgain, the manner in which the fire appears to have been originally\r\nkindled on these occasions has been alleged in support of the view\r\nthat it was intended to be a mock-sun. As some scholars have\r\nperceived, it is highly probable that at the periodic festivals in\r\nformer times fire was universally obtained by the friction of two\r\npieces of wood. It is still so procured in some places both at the\r\nEaster and the Midsummer festivals, and it is expressly said to have\r\nbeen formerly so procured at the Beltane celebration both in\r\nScotland and Wales. But what makes it nearly certain that this was\r\nonce the invariable mode of kindling the fire at these periodic\r\nfestivals is the analogy of the needfire, which has almost always\r\nbeen produced by the friction of wood, and sometimes by the\r\nrevolution of a wheel. It is a plausible conjecture that the wheel\r\nemployed for this purpose represents the sun, and if the fires at\r\nthe regularly recurring celebrations were formerly produced in the\r\nsame way, it might be regarded as a confirmation of the view that\r\nthey were originally sun-charms. In point of fact there is, as Kuhn\r\nhas indicated, some evidence to show that the midsummer fire was\r\noriginally thus produced. We have seen that many Hungarian\r\nswine-herds make fire on Midsummer Eve by rotating a wheel round a\r\nwooden axle wrapt in hemp, and that they drive their pigs through\r\nthe fire thus made. At Obermedlingen, in Swabia, the "fire of\r\nheaven," as it was called, was made on St. Vitus\'s Day (the\r\nfifteenth of June) by igniting a cart-wheel, which, smeared with\r\npitch and plaited with straw, was fastened on a pole twelve feet\r\nhigh, the top of the pole being inserted in the nave of the wheel.\r\nThis fire was made on the summit of a mountain, and as the flame\r\nascended, the people uttered a set form of words, with eyes and arms\r\ndirected heavenward. Here the fixing of a wheel on a pole and\r\nigniting it suggests that originally the fire was produced, as in\r\nthe case of the need-fire, by the revolution of a wheel. The day on\r\nwhich the ceremony takes place (the fifteenth of June) is near\r\nmidsummer; and we have seen that in Masuren fire is, or used to be,\r\nactually made on Midsummer Day by turning a wheel rapidly about an\r\noaken pole, though it is not said that the new fire so obtained is\r\nused to light a bonfire. However, we must bear in mind that in all\r\nsuch cases the use of a wheel may be merely a mechanical device to\r\nfacilitate the operation of fire-making by increasing the friction;\r\nit need not have any symbolical significance.\r\n\r\nFurther, the influence which these fires, whether periodic or\r\noccasional, are supposed to exert on the weather and vegetation may\r\nbe cited in support of the view that they are sun-charms, since the\r\neffects ascribed to them resemble those of sunshine. Thus, the\r\nFrench belief that in a rainy June the lighting of the midsummer\r\nbonfires will cause the rain to cease appears to assume that they\r\ncan disperse the dark clouds and make the sun to break out in\r\nradiant glory, drying the wet earth and dripping trees. Similarly\r\nthe use of the need-fire by Swiss children on foggy days for the\r\npurpose of clearing away the mist may very naturally be interpreted\r\nas a sun-charm. In the Vosges Mountains the people believe that the\r\nmidsummer fires help to preserve the fruits of the earth and ensure\r\ngood crops. In Sweden the warmth or cold of the coming season is\r\ninferred from the direction in which the flames of the May Day\r\nbonfire are blown; if they blow to the south, it will be warm, if to\r\nthe north, cold. No doubt at present the direction of the flames is\r\nregarded merely as an augury of the weather, not as a mode of\r\ninfluencing it. But we may be pretty sure that this is one of the\r\ncases in which magic has dwindled into divination. So in the Eifel\r\nMountains, when the smoke blows towards the corn-fields, this is an\r\nomen that the harvest will be abundant. But the older view may have\r\nbeen not merely that the smoke and flames prognosticated, but that\r\nthey actually produced an abundant harvest, the heat of the flames\r\nacting like sunshine on the corn. Perhaps it was with this view that\r\npeople in the Isle of Man lit fires to windward of their fields in\r\norder that the smoke might blow over them. So in South Africa, about\r\nthe month of April, the Matabeles light huge fires to the windward\r\nof their gardens, "their idea being that the smoke, by passing over\r\nthe crops, will assist the ripening of them." Among the Zulus also\r\n"medicine is burned on a fire placed to windward of the garden, the\r\nfumigation which the plants in consequence receive being held to\r\nimprove the crop." Again, the idea of our European peasants that the\r\ncorn will grow well as far as the blaze of the bonfire is visible,\r\nmay be interpreted as a remnant of the belief in the quickening and\r\nfertilising power of the bonfires. The same belief, it may be\r\nargued, reappears in the notion that embers taken from the bonfires\r\nand inserted in the fields will promote the growth of the crops, and\r\nit may be thought to underlie the customs of sowing flax-seed in the\r\ndirection in which the flames blow, of mixing the ashes of the\r\nbonfire with the seed-corn at sowing, of scattering the ashes by\r\nthemselves over the field to fertilise it, and of incorporating a\r\npiece of the Yule log in the plough to make the seeds thrive. The\r\nopinion that the flax or hemp will grow as high as the flames rise\r\nor the people leap over them belongs clearly to the same class of\r\nideas. Again, at Konz, on the banks of the Moselle, if the blazing\r\nwheel which was trundled down the hillside reached the river without\r\nbeing extinguished, this was hailed as a proof that the vintage\r\nwould be abundant. So firmly was this belief held that the\r\nsuccessful performance of the ceremony entitled the villagers to\r\nlevy a tax upon the owners of the neighbouring vineyards. Here the\r\nunextinguished wheel might be taken to represent an unclouded sun,\r\nwhich in turn would portend an abundant vintage. So the waggon-load\r\nof white wine which the villagers received from the vineyards round\r\nabout might pass for a payment for the sunshine which they had\r\nprocured for the grapes. Similarly in the Vale of Glamorgan a\r\nblazing wheel used to be trundled down hill on Midsummer Day, and if\r\nthe fire were extinguished before the wheel reached the foot of the\r\nhill, the people expected a bad harvest; whereas if the wheel kept\r\nalight all the way down and continued to blaze for a long time, the\r\nfarmers looked forward to heavy crops that summer. Here, again, it\r\nis natural to suppose that the rustic mind traced a direct connexion\r\nbetween the fire of the wheel and the fire of the sun, on which the\r\ncrops are dependent.\r\n\r\nBut in popular belief the quickening and fertilising influence of\r\nthe bonfires is not limited to the vegetable world; it extends also\r\nto animals. This plainly appears from the Irish custom of driving\r\nbarren cattle through the midsummer fires, from the French belief\r\nthat the Yule log steeped in water helps cows to calve, from the\r\nFrench and Serbian notion that there will be as many chickens,\r\ncalves, lambs, and kids as there are sparks struck out of the Yule\r\nlog, from the French custom of putting the ashes of the bonfires in\r\nthe fowls\' nests to make the hens lay eggs, and from the German\r\npractice of mixing the ashes of the bonfires with the drink of\r\ncattle in order to make the animals thrive. Further, there are clear\r\nindications that even human fecundity is supposed to be promoted by\r\nthe genial heat of the fires. In Morocco the people think that\r\nchildless couples can obtain offspring by leaping over the midsummer\r\nbonfire. It is an Irish belief that a girl who jumps thrice over the\r\nmidsummer bonfire will soon marry and become the mother of many\r\nchildren; in Flanders women leap over the midsummer fires to ensure\r\nan easy delivery; in various parts of France they think that if a\r\ngirl dances round nine fires she will be sure to marry within the\r\nyear, and in Bohemia they fancy that she will do so if she merely\r\nsees nine of the bonfires. On the other hand, in Lechrain people say\r\nthat if a young man and woman, leaping over the midsummer fire\r\ntogether, escape unsmirched, the young woman will not become a\r\nmother within twelve months; the flames have not touched and\r\nfertilised her. In parts of Switzerland and France the lighting of\r\nthe Yule log is accompanied by a prayer that the women may bear\r\nchildren, the she-goats bring forth kids, and the ewes drop lambs.\r\nThe rule observed in some places that the bonfires should be kindled\r\nby the person who was last married seems to belong to the same class\r\nof ideas, whether it be that such a person is supposed to receive\r\nfrom, or to impart to, the fire a generative and fertilising\r\ninfluence. The common practice of lovers leaping over the fires hand\r\nin hand may very well have originated in a notion that thereby their\r\nmarriage would be blessed with offspring; and the like motive would\r\nexplain the custom which obliges couples married within the year to\r\ndance to the light of torches. And the scenes of profligacy which\r\nappear to have marked the midsummer celebration among the\r\nEsthonians, as they once marked the celebration of May Day among\r\nourselves, may have sprung, not from the mere licence of\r\nholiday-makers, but from a crude notion that such orgies were\r\njustified, if not required, by some mysterious bond which linked the\r\nlife of man to the courses of the heavens at this turning-point of\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\nAt the festivals which we are considering the custom of kindling\r\nbonfires is commonly associated with a custom of carrying lighted\r\ntorches about the fields, the orchards, the pastures, the flocks and\r\nthe herds; and we can hardly doubt that the two customs are only two\r\ndifferent ways of attaining the same object, namely, the benefits\r\nwhich are believed to flow from the fire, whether it be stationary\r\nor portable. Accordingly if we accept the solar theory of the\r\nbonfires, we seem bound to apply it also to the torches; we must\r\nsuppose that the practice of marching or running with blazing\r\ntorches about the country is simply a means of diffusing far and\r\nwide the genial influence of the sunshine of which these flickering\r\nflames are a feeble imitation. In favour of this view it may be said\r\nthat sometimes the torches are carried about the fields for the\r\nexpress purpose of fertilising them, and with the same intention\r\nlive coals from the bonfires are sometimes placed in the fields to\r\nprevent blight. On the eve of Twelfth Day in Normandy men, women,\r\nand children run wildly through the fields and orchards with lighted\r\ntorches, which they wave about the branches and dash against the\r\ntrunks of the fruit-trees for the sake of burning the moss and\r\ndriving away the moles and field-mice. "They believe that the\r\nceremony fulfills the double object of exorcising the vermin whose\r\nmultiplication would be a real calamity, and of imparting fecundity\r\nto the trees, the fields, and even the cattle"; and they imagine\r\nthat the more the ceremony is prolonged, the greater will be the\r\ncrop of fruit next autumn. In Bohemia they say that the corn will\r\ngrow as high as they fling the blazing besoms into the air. Nor are\r\nsuch notions confined to Europe. In Corea, a few days before the New\r\nYear festival, the eunuchs of the palace swing burning torches,\r\nchanting invocations the while, and this is supposed to ensure\r\nbountiful crops for the next season. The custom of trundling a\r\nburning wheel over the fields, which used to be observed in Poitou\r\nfor the express purpose of fertilising them, may be thought to\r\nembody the same idea in a still more graphic form; since in this way\r\nthe mock-sun itself, not merely its light and heat represented by\r\ntorches, is made actually to pass over the ground which is to\r\nreceive its quickening and kindly influence. Once more, the custom\r\nof carrying lighted brands round cattle is plainly equivalent to\r\ndriving the animals through the bonfire; and if the bonfire is a\r\nsuncharm, the torches must be so also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The Purificatory Theory of the Fire-festivals\r\n\r\nTHUS far we have considered what may be said for the theory that at\r\nthe European fire-festivals the fire is kindled as a charm to ensure\r\nan abundant supply of sunshine for man and beast, for corn and\r\nfruits. It remains to consider what may be said against this theory\r\nand in favour of the view that in these rites fire is employed not\r\nas a creative but as a cleansing agent, which purifies men, animals,\r\nand plants by burning up and consuming the noxious elements, whether\r\nmaterial or spiritual, which menace all living things with disease\r\nand death.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, it is to be observed that the people who practise the\r\nfire-customs appear never to allege the solar theory in explanation\r\nof them, while on the contrary they do frequently and emphatically\r\nput forward the purificatory theory. This is a strong argument in\r\nfavour of the purificatory and against the solar theory; for the\r\npopular explanation of a popular custom is never to be rejected\r\nexcept for grave cause. And in the present case there seems to be no\r\nadequate reason for rejecting it. The conception of fire as a\r\ndestructive agent, which can be turned to account for the\r\nconsumption of evil things, is so simple and obvious that it could\r\nhardly escape the minds even of the rude peasantry with whom these\r\nfestivals originated. On the other hand the conception of fire as an\r\nemanation of the sun, or at all events as linked to it by a bond of\r\nphysical sympathy, is far less simple and obvious; and though the\r\nuse of fire as a charm to produce sunshine appears to be undeniable,\r\nnevertheless in attempting to explain popular customs we should\r\nnever have recourse to a more recondite idea when a simpler one lies\r\nto hand and is supported by the explicit testimony of the people\r\nthemselves. Now in the case of the fire-festivals the destructive\r\naspect of fire is one upon which the people dwell again and again;\r\nand it is highly significant that the great evil against which the\r\nfire is directed appears to be witchcraft. Again and again we are\r\ntold that the fires are intended to burn or repel the witches; and\r\nthe intention is sometimes graphically expressed by burning an\r\neffigy of a witch in the fire. Hence, when we remember the great\r\nhold which the dread of witchcraft has had on the popular European\r\nmind in all ages, we may suspect that the primary intention of all\r\nthese fire-festivals was simply to destroy or at all events get rid\r\nof the witches, who were regarded as the causes of nearly all the\r\nmisfortunes and calamities that befall men, their cattle, and their\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nThis suspicion is confirmed when we examine the evils for which the\r\nbonfires and torches were supposed to provide a remedy. Foremost,\r\nperhaps, among these evils we may reckon the diseases of cattle; and\r\nof all the ills that witches are believed to work there is probably\r\nnone which is so constantly insisted on as the harm they do to the\r\nherds, particularly by stealing the milk from the cows. Now it is\r\nsignificant that the need-fire, which may perhaps be regarded as the\r\nparent of the periodic fire-festivals, is kindled above all as a\r\nremedy for a murrain or other disease of cattle; and the\r\ncircumstance suggests, what on general grounds seems probable, that\r\nthe custom of kindling the need-fire goes back to a time when the\r\nancestors of the European peoples subsisted chiefly on the products\r\nof their herds, and when agriculture as yet played a subordinate\r\npart in their lives. Witches and wolves are the two great foes still\r\ndreaded by the herdsman in many parts of Europe; and we need not\r\nwonder that he should resort to fire as a powerful means of banning\r\nthem both. Among Slavonic peoples it appears that the foes whom the\r\nneed-fire is designed to combat are not so much living witches as\r\nvampyres and other evil spirits, and the ceremony aims rather at\r\nrepelling these baleful beings than at actually consuming them in\r\nthe flames. But for our present purpose these distinctions are\r\nimmaterial. The important thing to observe is that among the Slavs\r\nthe need-fire, which is probably the original of all the ceremonial\r\nfires now under consideration, is not a sun-charm, but clearly and\r\nunmistakably nothing but a means of protecting man and beast against\r\nthe attacks of maleficent creatures, whom the peasant thinks to burn\r\nor scare by the heat of the fire, just as he might burn or scare\r\nwild animals.\r\n\r\nAgain, the bonfires are often supposed to protect the fields against\r\nhail and the homestead against thunder and lightning. But both hail\r\nand thunderstorms are frequently thought to be caused by witches;\r\nhence the fire which bans the witches necessarily serves at the same\r\ntime as a talisman against hail, thunder, and lightning. Further,\r\nbrands taken from the bonfires are commonly kept in the houses to\r\nguard them against conflagration; and though this may perhaps be\r\ndone on the principle of homoeopathic magic, one fire being thought\r\nto act as a preventive of another, it is also possible that the\r\nintention may be to keep witch-incendiaries at bay. Again, people\r\nleap over the bonfires as a preventive of colic, and look at the\r\nflames steadily in order to preserve their eyes in good health; and\r\nboth colic and sore eyes are in Germany, and probably elsewhere, set\r\ndown to the machinations of witches. Once more, to leap over the\r\nmidsummer fires or to circumambulate them is thought to prevent a\r\nperson from feeling pains in his back at reaping; and in Germany\r\nsuch pains are called "witch-shots" and ascribed to witchcraft.\r\n\r\nBut if the bonfires and torches of the fire-festivals are to be\r\nregarded primarily as weapons directed against witches and wizards,\r\nit becomes probable that the same explanation applies not only to\r\nthe flaming discs which are hurled into the air, but also to the\r\nburning wheels which are rolled down hill on these occasions; discs\r\nand wheels, we may suppose, are alike intended to burn the witches\r\nwho hover invisible in the air or haunt unseen the fields, the\r\norchards, and the vineyards on the hillside. Certainly witches are\r\nconstantly thought to ride through the air on broomsticks or other\r\nequally convenient vehicles; and if they do so, how can you get at\r\nthem so effectually as by hurling lighted missiles, whether discs,\r\ntorches, or besoms, after them as they flit past overhead in the\r\ngloom? The South Slavonian peasant believes that witches ride in the\r\ndark hail-clouds; so he shoots at the clouds to bring down the hags,\r\nwhile he curses them, saying, "Curse, curse Herodias, thy mother is\r\na heathen, damned of God and fettered through the Redeemer\'s blood."\r\nAlso he brings out a pot of glowing charcoal on which he has thrown\r\nholy oil, laurel leaves, and wormwood to make a smoke. The fumes are\r\nsupposed to ascend to the clouds and stupefy the witches, so that\r\nthey tumble down to earth. And in order that they may not fall soft,\r\nbut may hurt themselves very much, the yokel hastily brings out a\r\nchair and tilts it bottom up so that the witch in falling may break\r\nher legs on the legs of the chair. Worse than that, he cruelly lays\r\nscythes, bill-hooks, and other formidable weapons edge upwards so as\r\nto cut and mangle the poor wretches when they drop plump upon them\r\nfrom the clouds.\r\n\r\nOn this view the fertility supposed to follow the application of\r\nfire in the form of bonfires, torches, discs, rolling wheels, and so\r\nforth, is not conceived as resulting directly from an increase of\r\nsolar heat which the fire has magically generated; it is merely an\r\nindirect result obtained by freeing the reproductive powers of\r\nplants and animals from the fatal obstruction of witchcraft. And\r\nwhat is true of the reproduction of plants and animals may hold good\r\nalso of the fertility of the human sexes. The bonfires are supposed\r\nto promote marriage and to procure offspring for childless couples.\r\nThis happy effect need not flow directly from any quickening or\r\nfertilising energy in the fire; it may follow indirectly from the\r\npower of the fire to remove those obstacles which the spells of\r\nwitches and wizards notoriously present to the union of man and\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, the theory of the purificatory virtue of the\r\nceremonial fires appears more probable and more in accordance with\r\nthe evidence than the opposing theory of their connexion with the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIV. The Burning of Human Beings in the Fires\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Burning of Effigies in the Fires\r\n\r\nWE have still to ask, What is the meaning of burning effigies in the\r\nfire at these festivals? After the preceding investigation the\r\nanswer to the question seems obvious. As the fires are often alleged\r\nto be kindled for the purpose of burning the witches, and as the\r\neffigy burnt in them is sometimes called "the Witch," we might\r\nnaturally be disposed to conclude that all the effigies consumed in\r\nthe flames on these occasions represent witches or warlocks, and\r\nthat the custom of burning them is merely a substitute for burning\r\nthe wicked men and women themselves, since on the principle of\r\nhomoeopathic or imitative magic you practically destroy the witch\r\nherself in destroying her effigy. On the whole this explanation of\r\nthe burning of straw figures in human shape at the festivals is\r\nperhaps the most probable.\r\n\r\nYet it may be that this explanation does not apply to all the cases,\r\nand that certain of them may admit and even require another\r\ninterpretation. For the effigies so burned, as I have already\r\nremarked, can hardly be separated from the effigies of Death which\r\nare burned or otherwise destroyed in spring; and grounds have been\r\nalready given for regarding the so-called effigies of Death as\r\nreally representatives of the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation.\r\nAre the other effigies, which are burned in the spring and midsummer\r\nbonfires, susceptible of the same explanation? It would seem so. For\r\njust as the fragments of the so-called Death are stuck in the fields\r\nto make the crops grow, so the charred embers of the figure burned\r\nin the spring bonfires are sometimes laid on the fields in the\r\nbelief that they will keep vermin from the crop. Again, the rule\r\nthat the last married bride must leap over the fire in which the\r\nstraw-man is burned on Shrove Tuesday, is probably intended to make\r\nher fruitful. But, as we have seen, the power of blessing women with\r\noffspring is a special attribute of tree-spirits; it is therefore a\r\nfair presumption that the burning effigy over which the bride must\r\nleap is a representative of the fertilising tree-spirit or spirit of\r\nvegetation. This character of the effigy, as representative of the\r\nspirit of vegetation, is almost unmistakable when the figure is\r\ncomposed of an unthreshed sheaf of corn or is covered from head to\r\nfoot with flowers. Again, it is to be noted that, instead of a\r\npuppet, trees, either living or felled, are sometimes burned both in\r\nthe spring and midsummer bonfires. Now, considering the frequency\r\nwith which the tree-spirit is represented in human shape, it is\r\nhardly rash to suppose that when sometimes a tree and sometimes an\r\neffigy is burned in these fires, the effigy and the tree are\r\nregarded as equivalent to each other, each being a representative of\r\nthe tree-spirit. This, again, is confirmed by observing, first, that\r\nsometimes the effigy which is to be burned is carried about\r\nsimultaneously with a May-tree, the former being carried by the\r\nboys, the latter by the girls; and, second, that the effigy is\r\nsometimes tied to a living tree and burned with it. In these cases,\r\nwe can scarcely doubt, the tree-spirit is represented, as we have\r\nfound it represented before, in duplicate, both by the tree and by\r\nthe effigy. That the true character of the effigy as a\r\nrepresentative of the beneficent spirit of vegetation should\r\nsometimes be forgotten, is natural. The custom of burning a\r\nbeneficent god is too foreign to later modes of thought to escape\r\nmisinterpretation. Naturally enough the people who continued to burn\r\nhis image came in time to identify it as the effigy of persons,\r\nwhom, on various grounds, they regarded with aversion, such as Judas\r\nIscariot, Luther, and a witch.\r\n\r\nThe general reasons for killing a god or his representative have\r\nbeen examined in a preceding chapter. But when the god happens to be\r\na deity of vegetation, there are special reasons why he should die\r\nby fire. For light and heat are necessary to vegetable growth; and,\r\non the principle of sympathetic magic, by subjecting the personal\r\nrepresentative of vegetation to their influence, you secure a supply\r\nof these necessaries for trees and crops. In other words, by burning\r\nthe spirit of vegetation in a fire which represents the sun, you\r\nmake sure that, for a time at least, vegetation shall have plenty of\r\nsun. It may be objected that, if the intention is simply to secure\r\nenough sunshine for vegetation, this end would be better attained,\r\non the principles of sympathetic magic, by merely passing the\r\nrepresentative of vegetation through the fire instead of burning\r\nhim. In point of fact this is sometimes done. In Russia, as we have\r\nseen, the straw figure of Kupalo is not burned in the midsummer\r\nfire, but merely carried backwards and forwards across it. But, for\r\nthe reasons already given, it is necessary that the god should die;\r\nso next day Kupalo is stripped of her ornaments and thrown into a\r\nstream. In this Russian custom the passage of the image through the\r\nfire, if it is not simply a purification, may possibly be a\r\nsun-charm; the killing of the god is a separate act, and the mode of\r\nkilling him--by drowning--is probably a rain-charm. But usually\r\npeople have not thought it necessary to draw this fine distinction;\r\nfor the various reasons already assigned, it is advantageous, they\r\nthink, to expose the god of vegetation to a considerable degree of\r\nheat, and it is also advantageous to kill him, and they combine\r\nthese advantages in a rough-and-ready way by burning him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The Burning of Men and Animals in the Fires\r\n\r\nIN THE POPULAR customs connected with the fire-festivals of Europe\r\nthere are certain features which appear to point to a former\r\npractice of human sacrifice. We have seen reasons for believing that\r\nin Europe living persons have often acted as representatives of the\r\ntree-spirit and corn-spirit and have suffered death as such. There\r\nis no reason, therefore, why they should not have been burned, if\r\nany special advantages were likely to be attained by putting them to\r\ndeath in that way. The consideration of human suffering is not one\r\nwhich enters into the calculations of primitive man. Now, in the\r\nfire-festivals which we are discussing, the pretence of burning\r\npeople is sometimes carried so far that it seems reasonable to\r\nregard it as a mitigated survival of an older custom of actually\r\nburning them. Thus in Aachen, as we saw, the man clad in peas-straw\r\nacts so cleverly that the children really believe he is being\r\nburned. At Jumi\xe8ges in Normandy the man clad all in green, who bore\r\nthe title of the Green Wolf, was pursued by his comrades, and when\r\nthey caught him they feigned to fling him upon the midsummer\r\nbonfire. Similarly at the Beltane fires in Scotland the pretended\r\nvictim was seized, and a show made of throwing him into the flames,\r\nand for some time afterwards people affected to speak of him as\r\ndead. Again, in the Hallowe\'en bonfires of Northeastern Scotland we\r\nmay perhaps detect a similar pretence in the custom observed by a\r\nlad of lying down as close to the fire as possible and allowing the\r\nother lads to leap over him. The titular king at Aix, who reigned\r\nfor a year and danced the first dance round the midsummer bonfire,\r\nmay perhaps in days of old have discharged the less agreeable duty\r\nof serving as fuel for that fire which in later times he only\r\nkindled. In the following customs Mannhardt is probably right in\r\nrecognising traces of an old custom of burning a leaf-clad\r\nrepresentative of the spirit of vegetation. At Wolfeck, in Austria,\r\non Midsummer Day, a boy completely clad in green fir branches goes\r\nfrom house to house, accompanied by a noisy crew, collecting wood\r\nfor the bonfire. As he gets the wood he sings:\r\n\r\n\r\n   "Forest trees I want,\r\n    No sour milk for me,\r\n    But beer and wine,\r\n    So can the wood-man be jolly and gay."\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Bavaria, also, the boys who go from house to house\r\ncollecting fuel for the midsummer bonfire envelop one of their\r\nnumber from head to foot in green branches of firs, and lead him by\r\na rope through the whole village. At Moosheim, in Wurtemberg, the\r\nfestival of St. John\'s Fire usually lasted for fourteen days, ending\r\non the second Sunday after Midsummer Day. On this last day the\r\nbonfire was left in charge of the children, while the older people\r\nretired to a wood. Here they encased a young fellow in leaves and\r\ntwigs, who, thus disguised, went to the fire, scattered it, and trod\r\nit out. All the people present fled at the sight of him.\r\n\r\nBut it seems possible to go farther than this. Of human sacrifices\r\noffered on these occasions the most unequivocal traces, as we have\r\nseen, are those which, about a hundred years ago, still lingered at\r\nthe Beltane fires in the Highlands of Scotland, that is, among a\r\nCeltic people who, situated in a remote corner of Europe and almost\r\ncompletely isolated from foreign influence, had till then conserved\r\ntheir old heathenism better perhaps than any other people in the\r\nWest of Europe. It is significant, therefore, that human sacrifices\r\nby fire are known, on unquestionable evidence, to have been\r\nsystematically practised by the Celts. The earliest description of\r\nthese sacrifices has been bequeathed to us by Julius Caesar. As\r\nconqueror of the hitherto independent Celts of Gaul, Caesar had\r\nample opportunity of observing the national Celtic religion and\r\nmanners, while these were still fresh and crisp from the native mint\r\nand had not yet been fused in the melting-pot of Roman civilisation.\r\nWith his own notes Caesar appears to have incorporated the\r\nobservations of a Greek explorer, by name Posidonius, who travelled\r\nin Gaul about fifty years before Caesar carried the Roman arms to\r\nthe English Channel. The Greek geographer Strabo and the historian\r\nDiodorus seem also to have derived their descriptions of the Celtic\r\nsacrifices from the work of Posidonius, but independently of each\r\nother, and of Caesar, for each of the three derivative accounts\r\ncontain some details which are not to be found in either of the\r\nothers. By combining them, therefore, we can restore the original\r\naccount of Posidonius with some probability, and thus obtain a\r\npicture of the sacrifices offered by the Celts of Gaul at the close\r\nof the second century before our era. The following seem to have\r\nbeen the main outlines of the custom. Condemned criminals were\r\nreserved by the Celts in order to be sacrificed to the gods at a\r\ngreat festival which took place once in every five years. The more\r\nthere were of such victims, the greater was believed to be the\r\nfertility of the land. If there were not enough criminals to furnish\r\nvictims, captives taken in war were immolated to supply the\r\ndeficiency. When the time came the victims were sacrificed by the\r\nDruids or priests. Some they shot down with arrows, some they\r\nimpaled, and some they burned alive in the following manner.\r\nColossal images of wicker-work or of wood and grass were\r\nconstructed; these were filled with live men, cattle, and animals of\r\nother kinds; fire was then applied to the images, and they were\r\nburned with their living contents.\r\n\r\nSuch were the great festivals held once every five years. But\r\nbesides these quinquennial festivals, celebrated on so grand a\r\nscale, and with, apparently, so large an expenditure of human life,\r\nit seems reasonable to suppose that festivals of the same sort, only\r\non a lesser scale, were held annually, and that from these annual\r\nfestivals are lineally descended some at least of the fire-festivals\r\nwhich, with their traces of human sacrifices, are still celebrated\r\nyear by year in many parts of Europe. The gigantic images\r\nconstructed of osiers or covered with grass in which the Druids\r\nenclosed their victims remind us of the leafy framework in which the\r\nhuman representative of the tree-spirit is still so often encased.\r\nHence, seeing that the fertility of the land was apparently supposed\r\nto depend upon the due performance of these sacrifices, Mannhardt\r\ninterpreted the Celtic victims, cased in osiers and grass, as\r\nrepresentatives of the tree-spirit or spirit of vegetation.\r\n\r\nThese wicker giants of the Druids seem to have had till lately, if\r\nnot down to the present time, their representatives at the spring\r\nand midsummer festivals of modern Europe. At Douay, down at least to\r\nthe early part of the nineteenth century, a procession took place\r\nannually on the Sunday nearest to the seventh of July. The great\r\nfeature of the procession was a colossal figure, some twenty or\r\nthirty feet high, made of osiers, and called "the giant," which was\r\nmoved through the streets by means of rollers and ropes worked by\r\nmen who were enclosed within the effigy. The figure was armed as a\r\nknight with lance and sword, helmet and shield. Behind him marched\r\nhis wife and his three children, all constructed of osiers on the\r\nsame principle, but on a smaller scale. At Dunkirk the procession of\r\nthe giants took place on Midsummer Day, the twenty-fourth of June.\r\nThe festival, which was known as the Follies of Dunkirk, attracted\r\nmultitudes of spectators. The giant was a huge figure of\r\nwicker-work, occasionally as much as forty-five feet high, dressed\r\nin a long blue robe with gold stripes, which reached to his feet,\r\nconcealing the dozen or more men who made it dance and bob its head\r\nto the spectators. This colossal effigy went by the name of Papa\r\nReuss, and carried in its pocket a bouncing infant of Brobdingnagian\r\nproportions. The rear was brought up by the daughter of the giant,\r\nconstructed, like her sire, of wicker-work, and little, if at all,\r\ninferior to him in size. Most towns and even villages of Brabant and\r\nFlanders have, or used to have, similar wicker giants which were\r\nannually led about to the delight of the populace, who loved these\r\ngrotesque figures, spoke of them with patriotic enthusiasm, and\r\nnever wearied of gazing at them. At Antwerp the giant was so big\r\nthat no gate in the city was large enough to let him go through;\r\nhence he could not visit his brother giants in neighbouring towns,\r\nas the other Belgian giants used to do on solemn occasions.\r\n\r\nIn England artificial giants seem to have been a standing feature of\r\nthe midsummer festival. A writer of the sixteenth century speaks of\r\n"Midsommer pageants in London, where to make the people wonder, are\r\nset forth great and uglie gyants marching as if they were alive, and\r\narmed at all points, but within they are stuffed full of browne\r\npaper and tow, which the shrewd boyes, underpeering, do guilefully\r\ndiscover, and turne to a greate derision." At Chester the annual\r\npageant on Midsummer Eve included the effigies of four giants, with\r\nanimals, hobby-horses, and other figures. At Coventry it appears\r\nthat the giant\'s wife figured beside the giant. At Burford, in\r\nOxfordshire, Midsummer Eve used to be celebrated with great jollity\r\nby the carrying of a giant and a dragon up and down the town. The\r\nlast survivor of these perambulating English giants lingered at\r\nSalisbury, where an antiquary found him mouldering to decay in the\r\nneglected hall of the Tailors\' Company about the year 1844. His\r\nbodily framework was a lath and hoop, like the one which used to be\r\nworn by Jack-in-the-Green on May Day.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the giants merely figured in the processions. But\r\nsometimes they were burned in the summer bonfires. Thus the people\r\nof the Rue aux Ours in Paris used annually to make a great\r\nwicker-work figure, dressed as a soldier, which they promenaded up\r\nand down the streets for several days, and solemnly burned on the\r\nthird of July, the crowd of spectators singing _Salve Regina._ A\r\npersonage who bore the title of king presided over the ceremony with\r\na lighted torch in his hand. The burning fragments of the image were\r\nscattered among the people, who eagerly scrambled for them. The\r\ncustom was abolished in 1743. In Brie, Isle de France, a wicker-work\r\ngiant, eighteen feet high, was annually burned on Midsummer Eve.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Druidical custom of burning live animals, enclosed in\r\nwicker-work, has its counterpart at the spring and midsummer\r\nfestivals. At Luchon in the Pyrenees on Midsummer Eve "a hollow\r\ncolumn, composed of strong wicker-work, is raised to the height of\r\nabout sixty feet in the centre of the principal suburb, and\r\ninterlaced with green foliage up to the very top; while the most\r\nbeautiful flowers and shrubs procurable are artistically arranged in\r\ngroups below, so as to form a sort of background to the scene. The\r\ncolumn is then filled with combustible materials, ready for\r\nignition. At an appointed hour--about 8 P.M.--a grand procession,\r\ncomposed of the clergy, followed by young men and maidens in holiday\r\nattire, pour forth from the town chanting hymns, and take up their\r\nposition around the column. Meanwhile, bonfires are lit, with\r\nbeautiful effect, in the surrounding hills. As many living serpents\r\nas could be collected are now thrown into the column, which is set\r\non fire at the base by means of torches, armed with which about\r\nfifty boys and men dance around with frantic gestures. The serpents,\r\nto avoid the flames, wriggle their way to the top, whence they are\r\nseen lashing out laterally until finally obliged to drop, their\r\nstruggles for life giving rise to enthusiastic delight among the\r\nsurrounding spectators. This is a favourite annual ceremony for the\r\ninhabitants of Luchon and its neighbourhood, and local tradition\r\nassigns it to a heathen origin." In the midsummer fires formerly\r\nkindled on the Place de Gr\xe8ve at Paris it was the custom to burn a\r\nbasket, barrel, or sack full of live cats, which was hung from a\r\ntall mast in the midst of the bonfire; sometimes a fox was burned.\r\nThe people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them\r\nhome, believing that they brought good luck. The French kings often\r\nwitnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own\r\nhands. In 1648 Louis the Fourteenth, crowned with a wreath of roses\r\nand carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced\r\nat it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. But\r\nthis was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer\r\nbonfire in Paris. At Metz midsummer fires were lighted with great\r\npomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in wicker cages,\r\nwere burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people. Similarly\r\nat Gap, in the department of the High Alps, cats used to be roasted\r\nover the midsummer bonfire. In Russia a white cock was sometimes\r\nburned in the midsummer bonfire; in Meissen or Thuringia a horse\'s\r\nhead used to be thrown into it. Sometimes animals are burned in the\r\nspring bonfires. In the Vosges cats were burned on Shrove Tuesday;\r\nin Alsace they were thrown into the Easter bonfire. In the\r\ndepartment of the Ardennes cats were flung into the bonfires kindled\r\non the first Sunday in Lent; sometimes, by a refinement of cruelty,\r\nthey were hung over the fire from the end of a pole and roasted\r\nalive. "The cat, which represented the devil, could never suffer\r\nenough." While the creatures were perishing in the flames, the\r\nshepherds guarded their flocks and forced them to leap over the\r\nfire, esteeming this an infallible means of preserving them from\r\ndisease and witchcraft. We have seen that squirrels were sometimes\r\nburned in the Easter fire.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that the sacrificial rites of the Celts of ancient\r\nGaul can be traced in the popular festivals of modern Europe.\r\nNaturally it is in France, or rather in the wider area comprised\r\nwithin the limits of ancient Gaul, that these rites have left the\r\nclearest traces in the customs of burning giants of wicker-work and\r\nanimals enclosed in wicker-work or baskets. These customs, it will\r\nhave been remarked, are generally observed at or about midsummer.\r\nFrom this we may infer that the original rites of which these are\r\nthe degenerate successors were solemnised at midsummer. This\r\ninference harmonises with the conclusion suggested by a general\r\nsurvey of European folk-custom, that the midsummer festival must on\r\nthe whole have been the most widely diffused and the most solemn of\r\nall the yearly festivals celebrated by the primitive Aryans in\r\nEurope. At the same time we must bear in mind that among the British\r\nCelts the chief fire-festivals of the year appear certainly to have\r\nbeen those of Beltane (May Day) and Hallowe\'en (the last day of\r\nOctober); and this suggests a doubt whether the Celts of Gaul also\r\nmay not have celebrated their principal rites of fire, including\r\ntheir burnt sacrifices of men and animals, at the beginning of May\r\nor the beginning of November rather than at Midsummer.\r\n\r\nWe have still to ask, What is the meaning of such sacrifices? Why\r\nwere men and animals burnt to death at these festivals? If we are\r\nright in interpreting the modern European fire-festivals as attempts\r\nto break the power of witchcraft by burning or banning the witches\r\nand warlocks, it seems to follow that we must explain the human\r\nsacrifices of the Celts in the same manner; that is, we must suppose\r\nthat the men whom the Druids burnt in wicker-work images were\r\ncondemned to death on the ground that they were witches or wizards,\r\nand that the mode of execution by fire was chosen because burning\r\nalive is deemed the surest mode of getting rid of these noxious and\r\ndangerous beings. The same explanation would apply to the cattle and\r\nwild animals of many kinds which the Celts burned along with the\r\nmen. They, too, we may conjecture, were supposed to be either under\r\nthe spell of witchcraft or actually to be the witches and wizards,\r\nwho had transformed themselves into animals for the purpose of\r\nprosecuting their infernal plots against the welfare of their\r\nfellow-creatures. This conjecture is confirmed by the observation\r\nthat the victims most commonly burned in modern bonfires have been\r\ncats, and that cats are precisely the animals into which, with the\r\npossible exception of hares, witches were most usually supposed to\r\ntransform themselves. Again, we have seen that serpents and foxes\r\nused sometimes to be burnt in the midsummer fires; and Welsh and\r\nGerman witches are reported to have assumed the form both of foxes\r\nand serpents. In short, when we remember the great variety of\r\nanimals whose forms witches can assume at pleasure, it seems easy on\r\nthis hypothesis to account for the variety of living creatures that\r\nhave been burnt at festivals both in ancient Gaul and modern Europe;\r\nall these victims, we may surmise, were doomed to the flames, not\r\nbecause they were animals, but because they were believed to be\r\nwitches who had taken the shape of animals for their nefarious\r\npurposes. One advantage of explaining the ancient Celtic sacrifices\r\nin this way is that it introduces, as it were, a harmony and\r\nconsistency into the treatment which Europe has meted out to witches\r\nfrom the earliest times down to about two centuries ago, when the\r\ngrowing influence of rationalism discredited the belief in\r\nwitchcraft and put a stop to the custom of burning witches. Be that\r\nas it may, we can now perhaps understand why the Druids believed\r\nthat the more persons they sentenced to death, the greater would be\r\nthe fertility of the land. To a modern reader the connexion at first\r\nsight may not be obvious between the activity of the hangman and the\r\nproductivity of the earth. But a little reflection may satisfy him\r\nthat when the criminals who perish at the stake or on the gallows\r\nare witches, whose delight it is to blight the crops of the farmer\r\nor to lay them low under storms of hail, the execution of these\r\nwretches is really calculated to ensure an abundant harvest by\r\nremoving one of the principal causes which paralyse the efforts and\r\nblast the hopes of the husbandman.\r\n\r\nThe Druidical sacrifices which we are considering were explained in\r\na different way by W. Mannhardt. He supposed that the men whom the\r\nDruids burned in wicker-work images represented the spirits of\r\nvegetation, and accordingly that the custom of burning them was a\r\nmagical ceremony intended to secure the necessary sunshine for the\r\ncrops. Similarly, he seems to have inclined to the view that the\r\nanimals which used to be burnt in the bonfires represented the\r\ncornspirit, which, as we saw in an earlier part of this work, is\r\noften supposed to assume the shape of an animal. This theory is no\r\ndoubt tenable, and the great authority of W. Mannhardt entitles it\r\nto careful consideration. I adopted it in former editions of this\r\nbook; but on reconsideration it seems to me on the whole to be less\r\nprobable than the theory that the men and animals burnt in the fires\r\nperished in the character of witches. This latter view is strongly\r\nsupported by the testimony of the people who celebrate the\r\nfire-festivals, since a popular name for the custom of kindling the\r\nfires is "burning the witches," effigies of witches are sometimes\r\nconsumed in the flames, and the fires, their embers, or their ashes\r\nare supposed to furnish protection against witchcraft. On the other\r\nhand there is little to show that the effigies or the animals burnt\r\nin the fires are regarded by the people as representatives of the\r\nvegetation-spirit, and that the bonfires are sun-charms. With regard\r\nto serpents in particular, which used to be burnt in the midsummer\r\nfire at Luchon, I am not aware of any certain evidence that in\r\nEurope snakes have been regarded as embodiments of the tree-spirit\r\nor corn-spirit, though in other parts of the world the conception\r\nappears to be not unknown. Whereas the popular faith in the\r\ntransformation of witches into animals is so general and deeply\r\nrooted, and the fear of these uncanny beings is so strong, that it\r\nseems safer to suppose that the cats and other animals which were\r\nburnt in the fire suffered death as embodiments of witches than that\r\nthey perished as representatives of vegetation-spirits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXV. Balder and the Mistletoe\r\n\r\nTHE READER may remember that the preceding account of the popular\r\nfire-festivals of Europe was suggested by the myth of the Norse god\r\nBalder, who is said to have been slain by a branch of mistletoe and\r\nburnt in a great fire. We have now to enquire how far the customs\r\nwhich have been passed in review help to shed light on the myth. In\r\nthis enquiry it may be convenient to begin with the mistletoe, the\r\ninstrument of Balder\'s death.\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial the mistletoe has been the object of\r\nsuperstitious veneration in Europe. It was worshipped by the Druids,\r\nas we learn from a famous passage of Pliny. After enumerating the\r\ndifferent kinds of mistletoe, he proceeds: "In treating of this\r\nsubject, the admiration in which the mistletoe is held throughout\r\nGaul ought not to pass unnoticed. The Druids, for so they call their\r\nwizards, esteem nothing more sacred than the mistletoe and the tree\r\non which it grows, provided only that the tree is an oak. But apart\r\nfrom this they choose oak-woods for their sacred groves and perform\r\nno sacred rites without oak-leaves; so that the very name of Druids\r\nmay be regarded as a Greek appellation derived from their worship of\r\nthe oak. For they believe that whatever grows on these trees is sent\r\nfrom heaven, and is a sign that the tree has been chosen by the god\r\nhimself. The mistletoe is very rarely to be met with; but when it is\r\nfound, they gather it with solemn ceremony. This they do above all\r\non the sixth day of the moon, from whence they date the beginnings\r\nof their months, of their years, and of their thirty years\' cycle,\r\nbecause by the sixth day the moon has plenty of vigour and has not\r\nrun half its course. After due preparations have been made for a\r\nsacrifice and a feast under the tree, they hail it as the universal\r\nhealer and bring to the spot two white bulls, whose horns have never\r\nbeen bound before. A priest clad in a white robe climbs the tree and\r\nwith a golden sickle cuts the mistletoe, which is caught in a white\r\ncloth. Then they sacrifice the victims, praying that God may make\r\nhis own gift to prosper with those upon whom he has bestowed it.\r\nThey believe that a potion prepared from mistletoe will make barren\r\nanimals to bring forth, and that the plant is a remedy against all\r\npoison."\r\n\r\nIn another passage Pliny tells us that in medicine the mistletoe\r\nwhich grows on an oak was esteemed the most efficacious, and that\r\nits efficacy was by some superstitious people supposed to be\r\nincreased if the plant was gathered on the first day of the moon\r\nwithout the use of iron, and if when gathered it was not allowed to\r\ntouch the earth; oak-mistletoe thus obtained was deemed a cure for\r\nepilepsy; carried about by women it assisted them to conceive; and\r\nit healed ulcers most effectually, if only the sufferer chewed a\r\npiece of the plant and laid another piece on the sore. Yet, again,\r\nhe says that mistletoe was supposed, like vinegar and an egg, to be\r\nan excellent means of extinguishing a fire.\r\n\r\nIf in these latter passages Pliny refers, as he apparently does, to\r\nthe beliefs current among his contemporaries in Italy, it will\r\nfollow that the Druids and the Italians were to some extent agreed\r\nas to the valuable properties possessed by mistletoe which grows on\r\nan oak; both of them deemed it an effectual remedy for a number of\r\nailments, and both of them ascribed to it a quickening virtue, the\r\nDruids believing that a potion prepared from mistletoe would\r\nfertilise barren cattle, and the Italians holding that a piece of\r\nmistletoe carried about by a woman would help her to conceive a\r\nchild. Further, both peoples thought that if the plant were to exert\r\nits medicinal properties it must be gathered in a certain way and at\r\na certain time. It might not be cut with iron, hence the Druids cut\r\nit with gold; and it might not touch the earth, hence the Druids\r\ncaught it in a white cloth. In choosing the time for gathering the\r\nplant, both peoples were determined by observation of the moon; only\r\nthey differed as to the particular day of the moon, the Italians\r\npreferring the first, and the Druids the sixth.\r\n\r\nWith these beliefs of the ancient Gauls and Italians as to the\r\nwonderful medicinal properties of mistletoe we may compare the\r\nsimilar beliefs of the modern Aino of Japan. We read that they,\r\n"like many nations of the Northern origin, hold the mistletoe in\r\npeculiar veneration. They look upon it as a medicine, good in almost\r\nevery disease, and it is sometimes taken in food and at others\r\nseparately as a decoction. The leaves are used in preference to the\r\nberries, the latter being of too sticky a nature for general\r\npurposes. . . . But many, too, suppose this plant to have the power\r\nof making the gardens bear plentifully. When used for this purpose,\r\nthe leaves are cut up into fine pieces, and, after having been\r\nprayed over, are sown with the millet and other seeds, a little also\r\nbeing eaten with the food. Barren women have also been known to eat\r\nthe mistletoe, in order to be made to bear children. That mistletoe\r\nwhich grows upon the willow is supposed to have the greatest\r\nefficacy. This is because the willow is looked upon by them as being\r\nan especially sacred tree."\r\n\r\nThus the Aino agree with the Druids in regarding mistletoe as a cure\r\nfor almost every disease, and they agree with the ancient Italians\r\nthat applied to women it helps them to bear children. Again, the\r\nDruidical notion that the mistletoe was an "all-healer" or panacea\r\nmay be compared with a notion entertained by the Walos of\r\nSenegambia. These people "have much veneration for a sort of\r\nmistletoe, which they call _tob;_ they carry leaves of it on their\r\npersons when they go to war as a preservative against wounds, just\r\nas if the leaves were real talismans (_gris-gris_)." The French\r\nwriter who records this practice adds: "Is it not very curious that\r\nthe mistletoe should be in this part of Africa what it was in the\r\nsuperstitions of the Gauls? This prejudice, common to the two\r\ncountries, may have the same origin; blacks and whites will\r\ndoubtless have seen, each of them for themselves, something\r\nsupernatural in a plant which grows and flourishes without having\r\nroots in the earth. May they not have believed, in fact, that it was\r\na plant fallen from the sky, a gift of the divinity?"\r\n\r\nThis suggestion as to the origin of the superstition is strongly\r\nconfirmed by the Druidical belief, reported by Pliny, that whatever\r\ngrew on an oak was sent from heaven and was a sign that the tree had\r\nbeen chosen by the god himself. Such a belief explains why the\r\nDruids cut the mistletoe, not with a common knife, but with a golden\r\nsickle, and why, when cut, it was not suffered to touch the earth;\r\nprobably they thought that the celestial plant would have been\r\nprofaned and its marvellous virtue lost by contact with the ground.\r\nWith the ritual observed by the Druids in cutting the mistletoe we\r\nmay compare the ritual which in Cambodia is prescribed in a similar\r\ncase. They say that when you see an orchid growing as a parasite on\r\na tamarind tree, you should dress in white, take a new earthenware\r\npot, then climb the tree at noon, break off the plant, put it in the\r\npot and let the pot fall to the ground. After that you make in the\r\npot a decoction which confers the gift of invulnerability. Thus just\r\nas in Africa the leaves of one parasitic plant are supposed to\r\nrender the wearer invulnerable, so in Cambodia a decoction made from\r\nanother parasitic plant is considered to render the same service to\r\nsuch as make use of it, whether by drinking or washing. We may\r\nconjecture that in both places the notion of invulnerability is\r\nsuggested by the position of the plant, which, occupying a place of\r\ncomparative security above the ground, appears to promise to its\r\nfortunate possessor a similar security from some of the ills that\r\nbeset the life of man on earth. We have already met with examples of\r\nthe store which the primitive mind sets on such vantage grounds.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the origin of these beliefs and practices concerning\r\nthe mistletoe, certain it is that some of them have their analogies\r\nin the folk-lore of modern European peasants. For example, it is\r\nlaid down as a rule in various parts of Europe that mistletoe may\r\nnot be cut in the ordinary way but must be shot or knocked down with\r\nstones from the tree on which it is growing. Thus, in the Swiss\r\ncanton of Aargau "all parasitic plants are esteemed in a certain\r\nsense holy by the country folk, but most particularly so the\r\nmistletoe growing on an oak. They ascribe great powers to it, but\r\nshrink from cutting it off in the usual manner. Instead of that they\r\nprocure it in the following manner. When the sun is in Sagittarius\r\nand the moon is on the wane, on the first, third, or fourth day\r\nbefore the new moon, one ought to shoot down with an arrow the\r\nmistletoe of an oak and to catch it with the left hand as it falls.\r\nSuch mistletoe is a remedy for every ailment of children." Here\r\namong the Swiss peasants, as among the Druids of old, special virtue\r\nis ascribed to mistletoe which grows on an oak: it may not be cut in\r\nthe usual way: it must be caught as it falls to the ground; and it\r\nis esteemed a panacea for all diseases, at least of children. In\r\nSweden, also, it is a popular superstition that if mistletoe is to\r\npossess its peculiar virtue, it must either be shot down out of the\r\noak or knocked down with stones. Similarly, "so late as the early\r\npart of the nineteenth century, people in Wales believed that for\r\nthe mistletoe to have any power, it must be shot or struck down with\r\nstones off the tree where it grew."\r\n\r\nAgain, in respect of the healing virtues of mistletoe the opinion of\r\nmodern peasants, and even of the learned, has to some extent agreed\r\nwith that of the ancients. The Druids appear to have called the\r\nplant, or perhaps the oak on which it grew, the "all-healer"; and\r\n"all-healer" is said to be still a name of the mistletoe in the\r\nmodern Celtic speech of Brittany, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland. On\r\nSt. John\'s morning (Midsummer morning) peasants of Piedmont and\r\nLombardy go out to search the oak-leaves for the "oil of St. John,"\r\nwhich is supposed to heal all wounds made with cutting instruments.\r\nOriginally, perhaps, the "oil of St. John" was simply the mistletoe,\r\nor a decoction made from it. For in Holstein the mistletoe,\r\nespecially oak-mistletoe, is still regarded as a panacea for green\r\nwounds and as a sure charm to secure success in hunting; and at\r\nLacaune, in the south of France, the old Druidical belief in the\r\nmistletoe as an antidote to all poisons still survives among the\r\npeasantry; they apply the plant to the stomach of the sufferer or\r\ngive him a decoction of it to drink. Again, the ancient belief that\r\nmistletoe is a cure for epilepsy has survived in modern times not\r\nonly among the ignorant but among the learned. Thus in Sweden\r\npersons afflicted with the falling sickness think they can ward off\r\nattacks of the malady by carrying about with them a knife which has\r\na handle of oak mistletoe; and in Germany for a similar purpose\r\npieces of mistletoe used to be hung round the necks of children. In\r\nthe French province of Bourbonnais a popular remedy for epilepsy is\r\na decoction of mistletoe which has been gathered on an oak on St.\r\nJohn\'s Day and boiled with rye-flour. So at Bottesford in\r\nLincolnshire a decoction of mistletoe is supposed to be a palliative\r\nfor this terrible disease. Indeed mistletoe was recommended as a\r\nremedy for the falling sickness by high medical authorities in\r\nEngland and Holland down to the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nHowever, the opinion of the medical profession as to the curative\r\nvirtues of mistletoe has undergone a radical alteration. Whereas the\r\nDruids thought that mistletoe cured everything, modern doctors\r\nappear to think that it cures nothing. If they are right, we must\r\nconclude that the ancient and widespread faith in the medicinal\r\nvirtue of mistletoe is a pure superstition based on nothing better\r\nthan the fanciful inferences which ignorance has drawn from the\r\nparasitic nature of the plant, its position high up on the branch of\r\na tree seeming to protect it from the dangers to which plants and\r\nanimals are subject on the surface of the ground. From this point of\r\nview we can perhaps understand why mistletoe has so long and so\r\npersistently been prescribed as a cure for the falling sickness. As\r\nmistletoe cannot fall to the ground because it is rooted on the\r\nbranch of a tree high above the earth, it seems to follow as a\r\nnecessary consequence that an epileptic patient cannot possibly fall\r\ndown in a fit so long as he carries a piece of mistletoe in his\r\npocket or a decoction of mistletoe in his stomach. Such a train of\r\nreasoning would probably be regarded even now as cogent by a large\r\nportion of the human species.\r\n\r\nAgain the ancient Italian opinion that mistletoe extinguishes fire\r\nappears to be shared by Swedish peasants, who hang up bunches of\r\noak-mistletoe on the ceilings of their rooms as a protection against\r\nharm in general and conflagration in particular. A hint as to the\r\nway in which mistletoe comes to be possessed of this property is\r\nfurnished by the epithet "thunder-bosom," which people of the Aargau\r\ncanton in Switzerland apply to the plant. For a thunder-besom is a\r\nshaggy, bushy excrescence on branches of trees, which is popularly\r\nbelieved to be produced by a flash of lightning; hence in Bohemia a\r\nthunder-besom burnt in the fire protects the house against being\r\nstruck by a thunder-bolt. Being itself a product of lightning it\r\nnaturally serves, on homoeopathic principles, as a protection\r\nagainst lightning, in fact as a kind of lightning-conductor. Hence\r\nthe fire which mistletoe in Sweden is designed especially to avert\r\nfrom houses may be fire kindled by lightning; though no doubt the\r\nplant is equally effective against conflagration in general.\r\n\r\nAgain, mistletoe acts as a master-key as well as a\r\nlightning-conductor; for it is said to open all locks. But perhaps\r\nthe most precious of all the virtues of mistletoe is that it affords\r\nefficient protection against sorcery and witchcraft. That, no doubt,\r\nis the reason why in Austria a twig of mistletoe is laid on the\r\nthreshold as a preventive of nightmare; and it may be the reason why\r\nin the north of England they say that if you wish your dairy to\r\nthrive you should give your bunch of mistletoe to the first cow that\r\ncalves after New Year\'s Day, for it is well known that nothing is so\r\nfatal to milk and butter as witchcraft. Similarly in Wales, for the\r\nsake of ensuring good luck to the dairy, people used to give a\r\nbranch of mistletoe to the first cow that gave birth to a calf after\r\nthe first hour of the New Year; and in rural districts of Wales,\r\nwhere mistletoe abounded, there was always a profusion of it in the\r\nfarmhouses. When mistletoe was scarce, Welsh farmers used to say,\r\n"No mistletoe, no luck"; but if there was a fine crop of mistletoe,\r\nthey expected a fine crop of corn. In Sweden mistletoe is diligently\r\nsought after on St. John\'s Eve, the people "believing it to be, in a\r\nhigh degree, possessed of mystic qualities; and that if a sprig of\r\nit be attached to the ceiling of the dwelling-house, the horse\'s\r\nstall, or the cow\'s crib, the Troll will then be powerless to injure\r\neither man or beast."\r\n\r\nWith regard to the time when the mistletoe should be gathered\r\nopinions have varied. The Druids gathered it above all on the sixth\r\nday of the moon, the ancient Italians apparently on the first day of\r\nthe moon. In modern times some have preferred the full moon of March\r\nand others the waning moon of winter when the sun is in Sagittarius.\r\nBut the favourite time would seem to be Midsummer Eve or Midsummer\r\nDay. We have seen that both in France and Sweden special virtues are\r\nascribed to mistletoe gathered at Midsummer. The rule in Sweden is\r\nthat "mistletoe must be cut on the night of Midsummer Eve when sun\r\nand moon stand in the sign of their might." Again, in Wales it was\r\nbelieved that a sprig of mistletoe gathered on St. John\'s Eve\r\n(Midsummer Eve), or at any time before the berries appeared, would\r\ninduce dreams of omen, both good and bad, if it were placed under\r\nthe pillow of the sleeper. Thus mistletoe is one of the many plants\r\nwhose magical or medicinal virtues are believed to culminate with\r\nthe culmination of the sun on the longest day of the year. Hence it\r\nseems reasonable to conjecture that in the eyes of the Druids, also,\r\nwho revered the plant so highly, the sacred mistletoe may have\r\nacquired a double portion of its mystic qualities at the solstice in\r\nJune, and that accordingly they may have regularly cut it with\r\nsolemn ceremony on Midsummer Eve.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, certain it is that the mistletoe, the instrument\r\nof Balder\'s death, has been regularly gathered for the sake of its\r\nmystic qualities on Midsummer Eve in Scandinavia, Balder\'s home. The\r\nplant is found commonly growing on pear-trees, oaks, and other trees\r\nin thick damp woods throughout the more temperate parts of Sweden.\r\nThus one of the two main incidents of Balder\'s myth is reproduced in\r\nthe great midsummer festival of Scandinavia. But the other main\r\nincident of the myth, the burning of Balder\'s body on a pyre, has\r\nalso its counterpart in the bonfires which still blaze, or blazed\r\ntill lately, in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden on Midsummer Eve. It\r\ndoes not appear, indeed, that any effigy is burned in these\r\nbonfires; but the burning of an effigy is a feature which might\r\neasily drop out after its meaning was forgotten. And the name of\r\nBalder\'s balefires (_Balder\'s Balar_), by which these midsummer\r\nfires were formerly known in Sweden, puts their connexion with\r\nBalder beyond the reach of doubt, and makes it probable that in\r\nformer times either a living representative or an effigy of Balder\r\nwas annually burned in them. Midsummer was the season sacred to\r\nBalder, and the Swedish poet Tegner, in placing the burning of\r\nBalder at midsummer, may very well have followed an old tradition\r\nthat the summer solstice was the time when the good god came to his\r\nuntimely end.\r\n\r\nThus it has been shown that the leading incidents of the Balder myth\r\nhave their counterparts in those fire-festivals of our European\r\npeasantry which undoubtedly date from a time long prior to the\r\nintroduction of Christianity. The pretence of throwing the victim\r\nchosen by lot into the Beltane fire, and the similar treatment of\r\nthe man, the future Green Wolf, at the midsummer bonfire in\r\nNormandy, may naturally be interpreted as traces of an older custom\r\nof actually burning human beings on these occasions; and the green\r\ndress of the Green Wolf, coupled with the leafy envelope of the\r\nyoung fellow who trod out the midsummer fire at Moosheim, seems to\r\nhint that the persons who perished at these festivals did so in the\r\ncharacter of tree-spirits or deities of vegetation. From all this we\r\nmay reasonably infer that in the Balder myth on the one hand, and\r\nthe fire-festivals and custom of gathering mistletoe on the other\r\nhand, we have, as it were, the two broken and dissevered halves of\r\nan original whole. In other words, we may assume with some degree of\r\nprobability that the myth of Balder\'s death was not merely a myth,\r\nthat is, a description of physical phenomena in imagery borrowed\r\nfrom human life, but that it was at the same time the story which\r\npeople told to explain why they annually burned a human\r\nrepresentative of the god and cut the mistletoe with solemn\r\nceremony. If I am right, the story of Balder\'s tragic end formed, so\r\nto say, the text of the sacred drama which was acted year by year as\r\na magical rite to cause the sun to shine, trees to grow, crops to\r\nthrive, and to guard man and beast from the baleful arts of fairies\r\nand trolls, of witches and warlocks. The tale belonged, in short, to\r\nthat class of nature myths which are meant to be supplemented by\r\nritual; here, as so often, myth stood to magic in the relation of\r\ntheory to practice.\r\n\r\nBut if the victims--the human Balders--who died by fire, whether in\r\nspring or at midsummer, were put to death as living embodiments of\r\ntree-spirits or deities of vegetation, it would seem that Balder\r\nhimself must have been a tree-spirit or deity of vegetation. It\r\nbecomes desirable, therefore, to determine, if we can, the\r\nparticular kind of tree or trees, of which a personal representative\r\nwas burned at the fire-festivals. For we may be quite sure that it\r\nwas not as a representative of vegetation in general that the victim\r\nsuffered death. The idea of vegetation in general is too abstract to\r\nbe primitive. Most probably the victim at first represented a\r\nparticular kind of sacred tree. But of all European trees none has\r\nsuch claims as the oak to be considered as pre-eminently the sacred\r\ntree of the Aryans. We have seen that its worship is attested for\r\nall the great branches of the Aryan stock in Europe; hence we may\r\ncertainly conclude that the tree was venerated by the Aryans in\r\ncommon before the dispersion, and that their primitive home must\r\nhave lain in a land which was clothed with forests of oak.\r\n\r\nNow, considering the primitive character and remarkable similarity\r\nof the fire-festivals observed by all the branches of the Aryan race\r\nin Europe, we may infer that these festivals form part of the common\r\nstock of religious observances which the various peoples carried\r\nwith them in their wanderings from their old home. But, if I am\r\nright, an essential feature of those primitive fire-festivals was\r\nthe burning of a man who represented the tree-spirit. In view, then,\r\nof the place occupied by the oak in the religion of the Aryans, the\r\npresumption is that the tree so represented at the fire-festivals\r\nmust originally have been the oak. So far as the Celts and\r\nLithuanians are concerned, this conclusion will perhaps hardly be\r\ncontested. But both for them and for the Germans it is confirmed by\r\na remarkable piece of religious conservatism. The most primitive\r\nmethod known to man of producing fire is by rubbing two pieces of\r\nwood against each other till they ignite; and we have seen that this\r\nmethod is still used in Europe for kindling sacred fires such as the\r\nneed-fire, and that most probably it was formerly resorted to at all\r\nthe fire-festivals under discussion. Now it is sometimes required\r\nthat the need-fire, or other sacred fire, should be made by the\r\nfriction of a particular kind of wood; and when the kind of wood is\r\nprescribed, whether among Celts, Germans, or Slavs, that wood\r\nappears to be generally the oak. But if the sacred fire was\r\nregularly kindled by the friction of oak-wood, we may infer that\r\noriginally the fire was also fed with the same material. In point of\r\nfact, it appears that the perpetual fire of Vesta at Rome was fed\r\nwith oak-wood, and that oak-wood was the fuel consumed in the\r\nperpetual fire which burned under the sacred oak at the great\r\nLithuanian sanctuary of Romove. Further, that oak-wood was formerly\r\nthe fuel burned in the midsummer fires may perhaps be inferred from\r\nthe custom, said to be still observed by peasants in many mountain\r\ndistricts of Germany, of making up the cottage fire on Midsummer Day\r\nwith a heavy block of oak-wood. The block is so arranged that it\r\nsmoulders slowly and is not finally reduced to charcoal till the\r\nexpiry of a year. Then upon next Midsummer Day the charred embers of\r\nthe old log are removed to make room for the new one, and are mixed\r\nwith the seed-corn or scattered about the garden. This is believed\r\nto guard the food cooked on the hearth from witchcraft, to preserve\r\nthe luck of the house, to promote the growth of the crops, and to\r\nkeep them from blight and vermin. Thus the custom is almost exactly\r\nparallel to that of the Yule-log, which in parts of Germany, France,\r\nEngland, Serbia, and other Slavonic lands was commonly of oak-wood.\r\nThe general conclusion is, that at those periodic or occasional\r\nceremonies the ancient Aryans both kindled and fed the fire with the\r\nsacred oak-wood.\r\n\r\nBut if at these solemn rites the fire was regularly made of oakwood,\r\nit follows that any man who was burned in it as a personification of\r\nthe tree-spirit could have represented no tree but the oak. The\r\nsacred oak was thus burned in duplicate; the wood of the tree was\r\nconsumed in the fire, and along with it was consumed a living man as\r\na personification of the oak-spirit. The conclusion thus drawn for\r\nthe European Aryans in general is confirmed in its special\r\napplication to the Scandinavians by the relation in which amongst\r\nthem the mistletoe appears to have stood to the burning of the\r\nvictim in the midsummer fire. We have seen that among Scandinavians\r\nit has been customary to gather the mistletoe at midsummer. But so\r\nfar as appears on the face of this custom, there is nothing to\r\nconnect it with the midsummer fires in which human victims or\r\neffigies of them were burned. Even if the fire, as seems probable,\r\nwas originally always made with oak-wood, why should it have been\r\nnecessary to pull the mistletoe? The last link between the midsummer\r\ncustoms of gathering the mistletoe and lighting the bonfires is\r\nsupplied by Balder\'s myth, which can hardly be disjoined from the\r\ncustoms in question. The myth suggests that a vital connexion may\r\nonce have been believed to subsist between the mistletoe and the\r\nhuman representative of the oak who was burned in the fire.\r\nAccording to the myth, Balder could be killed by nothing in heaven\r\nor earth except the mistletoe; and so long as the mistletoe remained\r\non the oak, he was not only immortal but invulnerable. Now, if we\r\nsuppose that Balder was the oak, the origin of the myth becomes\r\nintelligible. The mistletoe was viewed as the seat of life of the\r\noak, and so long as it was uninjured nothing could kill or even\r\nwound the oak. The conception of the mistletoe as the seat of life\r\nof the oak would naturally be suggested to primitive people by the\r\nobservation that while the oak is deciduous, the mistletoe which\r\ngrows on it is evergreen. In winter the sight of its fresh foliage\r\namong the bare branches must have been hailed by the worshippers of\r\nthe tree as a sign that the divine life which had ceased to animate\r\nthe branches yet survived in the mistletoe, as the heart of a\r\nsleeper still beats when his body is motionless. Hence when the god\r\nhad to be killed--when the sacred tree had to be burnt--it was\r\nnecessary to begin by breaking off the mistletoe. For so long as the\r\nmistletoe remained intact, the oak (so people might think) was\r\ninvulnerable; all the blows of their knives and axes would glance\r\nharmless from its surface. But once tear from the oak its sacred\r\nheart--the mistletoe--and the tree nodded to its fall. And when in\r\nlater times the spirit of the oak came to be represented by a living\r\nman, it was logically necessary to suppose that, like the tree he\r\npersonated, he could neither be killed nor wounded so long as the\r\nmistletoe remained uninjured. The pulling of the mistletoe was thus\r\nat once the signal and the cause of his death.\r\n\r\nOn this view the invulnerable Balder is neither more nor less than a\r\npersonification of a mistletoe-bearing oak. The interpretation is\r\nconfirmed by what seems to have been an ancient Italian belief, that\r\nthe mistletoe can be destroyed neither by fire nor water; for if the\r\nparasite is thus deemed indestructible, it might easily be supposed\r\nto communicate its own indestructibility to the tree on which it\r\ngrows, so long as the two remain in conjunction. Or, to put the same\r\nidea in mythical form, we might tell how the kindly god of the oak\r\nhad his life securely deposited in the imperishable mistletoe which\r\ngrew among the branches; how accordingly so long as the mistletoe\r\nkept its place there, the deity himself remained invulnerable; and\r\nhow at last a cunning foe, let into the secret of the god\'s\r\ninvulnerability, tore the mistletoe from the oak, thereby killing\r\nthe oak-god and afterwards burning his body in a fire which could\r\nhave made no impression on him so long as the incombustible parasite\r\nretained its seat among the boughs.\r\n\r\nBut since the idea of a being whose life is thus, in a sense,\r\noutside himself, must be strange to many readers, and has, indeed,\r\nnot yet been recognised in its full bearing on primitive\r\nsuperstition, it will be worth while to illustrate it by examples\r\ndrawn both from story and custom. The result will be to show that,\r\nin assuming this idea as the explanation of Balder\'s relation to the\r\nmistletoe, I assume a principle which is deeply engraved on the mind\r\nof primitive man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVI. The External Soul in Folk-Tales\r\n\r\nIN A FORMER part of this work we saw that, in the opinion of\r\nprimitive people, the soul may temporarily absent itself from the\r\nbody without causing death. Such temporary absences of the soul are\r\noften believed to involve considerable risk, since the wandering\r\nsoul is liable to a variety of mishaps at the hands of enemies, and\r\nso forth. But there is another aspect to this power of disengaging\r\nthe soul from the body. If only the safety of the soul can be\r\nensured during its absence, there is no reason why the soul should\r\nnot continue absent for an indefinite time; indeed a man may, on a\r\npure calculation of personal safety, desire that his soul should\r\nnever return to his body. Unable to conceive of life abstractly as a\r\n"permanent possibility of sensation" or a "continuous adjustment of\r\ninternal arrangements to external relations," the savage thinks of\r\nit as a concrete material thing of a definite bulk, capable of being\r\nseen and handled, kept in a box or jar, and liable to be bruised,\r\nfractured, or smashed in pieces. It is not needful that the life, so\r\nconceived, should be in the man; it may be absent from his body and\r\nstill continue to animate him by virtue of a sort of sympathy or\r\naction at a distance. So long as this object which he calls his life\r\nor soul remains unharmed, the man is well; if it is injured, he\r\nsuffers; if it is destroyed, he dies. Or, to put it otherwise, when\r\na man is ill or dies, the fact is explained by saying that the\r\nmaterial object called his life or soul, whether it be in his body\r\nor out of it, has either sustained injury or been destroyed. But\r\nthere may be circumstances in which, if the life or soul remains in\r\nthe man, it stands a greater chance of sustaining injury than if it\r\nwere stowed away in some safe and secret place. Accordingly, in such\r\ncircumstances, primitive man takes his soul out of his body and\r\ndeposits it for security in some snug spot, intending to replace it\r\nin his body when the danger is past. Or if he should discover some\r\nplace of absolute security, he may be content to leave his soul\r\nthere permanently. The advantage of this is that, so long as the\r\nsoul remains unharmed in the place where he has deposited it, the\r\nman himself is immortal; nothing can kill his body, since his life\r\nis not in it.\r\n\r\nEvidence of this primitive belief is furnished by a class of\r\nfolk-tales of which the Norse story of "The giant who had no heart\r\nin his body" is perhaps the best-known example. Stories of this kind\r\nare widely diffused over the world, and from their number and the\r\nvariety of incident and of details in which the leading idea is\r\nembodied, we may infer that the conception of an external soul is\r\none which has had a powerful hold on the minds of men at an early\r\nstage of history. For folk-tales are a faithful reflection of the\r\nworld as it appeared to the primitive mind; and we may be sure that\r\nany idea which commonly occurs in them, however absurd it may seem\r\nto us, must once have been an ordinary article of belief. This\r\nassurance, so far as it concerns the supposed power of disengaging\r\nthe soul from the body for a longer or shorter time, is amply\r\ncorroborated by a comparison of the folk-tales in question with the\r\nactual beliefs and practices of savages. To this we shall return\r\nafter some specimens of the tales have been given. The specimens\r\nwill be selected with a view of illustrating both the characteristic\r\nfeatures and the wide diffusion of this class of tales.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the story of the external soul is told, in\r\nvarious forms, by all Aryan peoples from Hindoostan to the Hebrides.\r\nA very common form of it is this: A warlock, giant, or other\r\nfairyland being is invulnerable and immortal because he keeps his\r\nsoul hidden far away in some secret place; but a fair princess, whom\r\nhe holds enthralled in his enchanted castle, wiles his secret from\r\nhim and reveals it to the hero, who seeks out the warlock\'s soul,\r\nheart, life, or death (as it is variously called), and by destroying\r\nit, simultaneously kills the warlock. Thus a Hindoo story tells how\r\na magician called Punchkin held a queen captive for twelve years,\r\nand would fain marry her, but she would not have him. At last the\r\nqueen\'s son came to rescue her, and the two plotted together to kill\r\nPunchkin. So the queen spoke the magician fair, and pretended that\r\nshe had at last made up her mind to marry him. "And do tell me," she\r\nsaid, "are you quite immortal? Can death never touch you? And are\r\nyou too great an enchanter ever to feel human suffering?" "It is\r\ntrue," he said, "that I am not as others. Far, far away, hundreds of\r\nthousands of miles from this, there lies a desolate country covered\r\nwith thick jungle. In the midst of the jungle grows a circle of palm\r\ntrees, and in the centre of the circle stand six chattees full of\r\nwater, piled one above another: below the sixth chattee is a small\r\ncage, which contains a little green parrot;--on the life of the\r\nparrot depends my life;--and if the parrot is killed I must die. It\r\nis, however," he added, "impossible that the parrot should sustain\r\nany injury, both on account of the inaccessibility of the country,\r\nand because, by my appointment, many thousand genii surround the\r\npalm trees, and kill all who approach the place." But the queen\'s\r\nyoung son overcame all difficulties, and got possession of the\r\nparrot. He brought it to the door of the magician\'s palace, and\r\nbegan playing with it. Punchkin, the magician, saw him, and, coming\r\nout, tried to persuade the boy to give him the parrot. "Give me my\r\nparrot!" cried Punchkin. Then the boy took hold of the parrot and\r\ntore off one of his wings; and as he did so the magician\'s right arm\r\nfell off. Punchkin then stretched out his left arm, crying, "Give me\r\nmy parrot!" The prince pulled off the parrot\'s second wing, and the\r\nmagician\'s left arm tumbled off. "Give me my parrot!" cried he, and\r\nfell on his knees. The prince pulled off the parrot\'s right leg, the\r\nmagician\'s right leg fell off; the prince pulled off the parrot\'s\r\nleft leg, down fell the magician\'s left. Nothing remained of him\r\nexcept the trunk and the head; but still he rolled his eyes, and\r\ncried, "Give me my parrot!" "Take your parrot, then," cried the boy;\r\nand with that he wrung the bird\'s neck, and threw it at the\r\nmagician; and, as he did so, Punchkin\'s head twisted round, and,\r\nwith a fearful groan, he died! In another Hindoo tale an ogre is\r\nasked by his daughter, "Papa, where do you keep your soul?" "Sixteen\r\nmiles away from this place," he said, "is a tree. Round the tree are\r\ntigers, and bears, and scorpions, and snakes; on the top of the tree\r\nis a very great fat snake; on his head is a little cage; in the cage\r\nis a bird; and my soul is in that bird." The end of the ogre is like\r\nthat of the magician in the previous tale. As the bird\'s wings and\r\nlegs are torn off, the ogre\'s arms and legs drop off; and when its\r\nneck is wrung he falls down dead. In a Bengalee story it is said\r\nthat all the ogres dwell in Ceylon, and that all their lives are in\r\na single lemon. A boy cuts the lemon in pieces, and all the ogres\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nIn a Siamese or Cambodian story, probably derived from India, we are\r\ntold that Thossakan or Ravana, the King of Ceylon, was able by magic\r\nart to take his soul out of his body and leave it in a box at home,\r\nwhile he went to the wars. Thus he was invulnerable in battle. When\r\nhe was about to give battle to Rama, he deposited his soul with a\r\nhermit called Fire-eye, who was to keep it safe for him. So in the\r\nfight Rama was astounded to see that his arrows struck the king\r\nwithout wounding him. But one of Rama\'s allies, knowing the secret\r\nof the king\'s invulnerability, transformed himself by magic into the\r\nlikeness of the king, and going to the hermit asked back his soul.\r\nOn receiving it he soared up into the air and flew to Rama,\r\nbrandishing the box and squeezing it so hard that all the breath\r\nleft the King of Ceylon\'s body, and he died. In a Bengalee story a\r\nprince going into a far country planted with his own hands a tree in\r\nthe courtyard of his father\'s palace, and said to his parents, "This\r\ntree is my life. When you see the tree green and fresh, then know\r\nthat it is well with me; when you see the tree fade in some parts,\r\nthen know that I am in an ill case; and when you see the whole tree\r\nfade, then know that I am dead and gone." In another Indian tale a\r\nprince, setting forth on his travels, left behind him a barley\r\nplant, with instructions that it should be carefully tended and\r\nwatched; for if it flourished, he would be alive and well, but if it\r\ndrooped, then some mischance was about to happen to him. And so it\r\nfell out. For the prince was beheaded, and as his head rolled off,\r\nthe barley plant snapped in two and the ear of barley fell to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nIn Greek tales, ancient and modern, the idea of an external soul is\r\nnot uncommon. When Meleager was seven days old, the Fates appeared\r\nto his mother and told her that Meleager would die when the brand\r\nwhich was blazing on the hearth had burnt down. So his mother\r\nsnatched the brand from the fire and kept it in a box. But in\r\nafter-years, being enraged at her son for slaying her brothers, she\r\nburnt the brand in the fire and Meleager expired in agonies, as if\r\nflames were preying on his vitals. Again, Nisus King of Megara had a\r\npurple or golden hair on the middle of his head, and it was fated\r\nthat whenever the hair was pulled out the king should die. When\r\nMegara was besieged by the Cretans, the king\'s daughter Scylla fell\r\nin love with Minos, their king, and pulled out the fatal hair from\r\nher father\'s head. So he died. In a modern Greek folk-tale a man\'s\r\nstrength lies in three golden hairs on his head. When his mother\r\npulls them out, he grows weak and timid and is slain by his enemies.\r\nIn another modern Greek story the life of an enchanter is bound up\r\nwith three doves which are in the belly of a wild boar. When the\r\nfirst dove is killed, the magician grows sick; when the second is\r\nkilled, he grows very sick; and when the third is killed, he dies.\r\nIn another Greek story of the same sort an ogre\'s strength is in\r\nthree singing birds which are in a wild boar. The hero kills two of\r\nthe birds, and then coming to the ogre\'s house finds him lying on\r\nthe ground in great pain. He shows the third bird to the ogre, who\r\nbegs that the hero will either let it fly away or give it to him to\r\neat. But the hero wrings the bird\'s neck, and the ogre dies on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nIn a modern Roman version of "Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp," the\r\nmagician tells the princess, whom he holds captive in a floating\r\nrock in mid-ocean, that he will never die. The princess reports this\r\nto the prince her husband, who has come to rescue her. The prince\r\nreplies, "It is impossible but that there should be some one thing\r\nor other that is fatal to him; ask him what that one fatal thing\r\nis." So the princess asked the magician, and he told her that in the\r\nwood was a hydra with seven heads; in the middle head of the hydra\r\nwas a leveret, in the head of the leveret was a bird, in the bird\'s\r\nhead was a precious stone, and if this stone were put under his\r\npillow he would die. The prince procured the stone, and the princess\r\nlaid it under the magician\'s pillow. No sooner did the enchanter lay\r\nhis head on the pillow than he gave three terrible yells, turned\r\nhimself round and round three times, and died.\r\n\r\nStories of the same sort are current among Slavonic peoples. Thus a\r\nRussian story tells how a warlock called Koshchei the Deathless\r\ncarried off a princess and kept her prisoner in his golden castle.\r\nHowever, a prince made up to her one day as she was walking alone\r\nand disconsolate in the castle garden, and cheered by the prospect\r\nof escaping with him she went to the warlock and coaxed him with\r\nfalse and flattering words, saying, "My dearest friend, tell me, I\r\npray you, will you never die?" "Certainly not," says he. "Well,"\r\nsays she, "and where is your death? is it in your dwelling?" "To be\r\nsure it is," says he, "it is in the broom under the threshold."\r\nThereupon the princess seized the broom and threw it on the fire,\r\nbut although the broom burned, the deathless Koshchei remained\r\nalive; indeed not so much as a hair of him was singed. Balked in her\r\nfirst attempt, the artful hussy pouted and said, "You do not love me\r\ntrue, for you have not told me where your death is; yet I am not\r\nangry, but love you with all my heart." With these fawning words she\r\nbesought the warlock to tell her truly where his death was. So he\r\nlaughed and said, "Why do you wish to know? Well then, out of love I\r\nwill tell you where it lies. In a certain field there stand three\r\ngreen oaks, and under the roots of the largest oak is a worm, and if\r\never this worm is found and crushed, that instant I shall die." When\r\nthe princess heard these words, she went straight to her lover and\r\ntold him all; and he searched till he found the oaks and dug up the\r\nworm and crushed it. Then he hurried to the warlock\'s castle, but\r\nonly to learn from the princess that the warlock was still alive.\r\nThen she fell to wheedling and coaxing Koshchei once more, and this\r\ntime, overcome by her wiles, he opened his heart to her and told her\r\nthe truth. "My death," said he, "is far from here and hard to find,\r\non the wide ocean. In that sea is an island, and on the island there\r\ngrows a green oak, and beneath the oak is an iron chest, and in the\r\nchest is a small basket, and in the basket is a hare, and in the\r\nhare is a duck, and in the duck is an egg; and he who finds the egg\r\nand breaks it, kills me at the same time." The prince naturally\r\nprocured the fateful egg and with it in his hands he confronted the\r\ndeathless warlock. The monster would have killed him, but the prince\r\nbegan to squeeze the egg. At that the warlock shrieked with pain,\r\nand turning to the false princess, who stood by smirking and\r\nsmiling, "Was it not out of love for you," said he, "that I told you\r\nwhere my death was? And is this the return you make to me?" With\r\nthat he grabbed at his sword, which hung from a peg on the wall; but\r\nbefore he could reach it, the prince had crushed the egg, and sure\r\nenough the deathless warlock found his death at the same moment. "In\r\none of the descriptions of Koshchei\'s death, he is said to be killed\r\nby a blow on the forehead inflicted by the mysterious egg--that last\r\nlink in the magic chain by which his life is darkly bound. In\r\nanother version of the same story, but told of a snake, the fatal\r\nblow is struck by a small stone found in the yolk of an egg, which\r\nis inside a duck, which is inside a hare, which is inside a stone,\r\nwhich is on an island."\r\n\r\nAmongst peoples of the Teutonic stock stories of the external soul\r\nare not wanting. In a tale told by the Saxons of Transylvania it is\r\nsaid that a young man shot at a witch again and again. The bullets\r\nwent clean through her but did her no harm, and she only laughed and\r\nmocked at him. "Silly earthworm," she cried, "shoot as much as you\r\nlike. It does me no harm. For know that my life resides not in me\r\nbut far, far away. In a mountain is a pond, on the pond swims a\r\nduck, in the duck is an egg, in the egg burns a light, that light is\r\nmy life. If you could put out that light, my life would be at an\r\nend. But that can never, never be." However, the young man got hold\r\nof the egg, smashed it, and put out the light, and with it the\r\nwitch\'s life went out also. In a German story a cannibal called Body\r\nwithout Soul or Soulless keeps his soul in a box, which stands on a\r\nrock in the middle of the Red Sea. A soldier gets possession of the\r\nbox and goes with it to Soulless, who begs the soldier to give him\r\nback his soul. But the soldier opens the box, takes out the soul,\r\nand flings it backward over his head. At the same moment the\r\ncannibal drops dead to the ground.\r\n\r\nIn another German story and old warlock lives with a damsel all\r\nalone in the midst of a vast and gloomy wood. She fears that being\r\nold he may die and leave her alone in the forest. But he reassures\r\nher. "Dear child," he said, "I cannot die, and I have no heart in my\r\nbreast." But she importuned him to tell her where his heart was. So\r\nhe said, "Far, far from here in an unknown and lonesome land stands\r\na great church. The church is well secured with iron doors, and\r\nround about it flows a broad deep moat. In the church flies a bird\r\nand in the bird is my heart. So long as the bird lives, I live. It\r\ncannot die of itself, and no one can catch it; therefore I cannot\r\ndie, and you need have no anxiety." However the young man, whose\r\nbride the damsel was to have been before the warlock spirited her\r\naway, contrived to reach the church and catch the bird. He brought\r\nit to the damsel, who stowed him and it away under the warlock\'s\r\nbed. Soon the old warlock came home. He was ailing, and said so. The\r\ngirl wept and said, "Alas, daddy is dying; he has a heart in his\r\nbreast after all." "Child," replied the warlock, "hold your tongue.\r\nI _can\'t_ die. It will soon pass over." At that the young man under\r\nthe bed gave the bird a gentle squeeze; and as he did so, the old\r\nwarlock felt very unwell and sat down. Then the young man gripped\r\nthe bird tighter, and the warlock fell senseless from his chair.\r\n"Now squeeze him dead," cried the damsel. Her lover obeyed, and when\r\nthe bird was dead, the old warlock also lay dead on the floor.\r\n\r\nIn the Norse tale of "the giant who had no heart in his body," the\r\ngiant tells the captive princess, "Far, far away in a lake lies an\r\nisland, on that island stands a church, in that church is a well, in\r\nthat well swims a duck, in that duck there is an egg, and in that\r\negg there lies my heart." The hero of the tale, with the help of\r\nsome animals to whom he had been kind, obtains the egg and squeezes\r\nit, at which the giant screams piteously and begs for his life. But\r\nthe hero breaks the egg in pieces and the giant at once bursts. In\r\nanother Norse story a hill-ogre tells the captive princess that she\r\nwill never be able to return home unless she finds the grain of sand\r\nwhich lies under the ninth tongue of the ninth head of a certain\r\ndragon; but if that grain of sand were to come over the rock in\r\nwhich the ogres live, they would all burst "and the rock itself\r\nwould become a gilded palace, and the lake green meadows." The hero\r\nfinds the grain of sand and takes it to the top of the high rock in\r\nwhich the ogres live. So all the ogres burst and the rest falls out\r\nas one of the ogres had foretold.\r\n\r\nIn a Celtic tale, recorded in the West Highlands of Scotland, a\r\ngiant is questioned by a captive queen as to where he keeps his\r\nsoul. At last, after deceiving her several times, he confides to her\r\nthe fatal secret: "There is a great flagstone under the threshold.\r\nThere is a wether under the flag. There is a duck in the wether\'s\r\nbelly, and an egg in the belly of the duck, and it is in the egg\r\nthat my soul is." On the morrow when the giant was gone, the queen\r\ncontrived to get possession of the egg and crushed it in her hands,\r\nand at that very moment the giant, who was coming home in the dusk,\r\nfell down dead. In another Celtic tale, a sea beast has carried off\r\na king\'s daughter, and an old smith declares that there is no way of\r\nkilling the beast but one. "In the island that is in the midst of\r\nthe loch is Eillid Chaisfhion--the white-footed hind, of the\r\nslenderest legs, and the swiftest step, and though she should be\r\ncaught, there would spring a hoodie out of her, and though the\r\nhoodie should be caught, there would spring a trout out of her, but\r\nthere is an egg in the mouth of the trout, and the soul of the beast\r\nis in the egg, and if the egg breaks, the beast is dead." As usual\r\nthe egg is broken and the beast dies.\r\n\r\nIn an Irish story we read how a giant kept a beautiful damsel a\r\nprisoner in his castle on the top of a hill, which was white with\r\nthe bones of the champions who had tried in vain to rescue the fair\r\ncaptive. At last the hero, after hewing and slashing at the giant\r\nall to no purpose, discovered that the only way to kill him was to\r\nrub a mole on the giant\'s right breast with a certain egg, which was\r\nin a duck, which was in a chest, which lay locked and bound at the\r\nbottom of the sea. With the help of some obliging animals, the hero\r\nmade himself master of the precious egg and slew the giant by merely\r\nstriking it against the mole on his right breast. Similarly in a\r\nBreton story there figures a giant whom neither fire nor water nor\r\nsteel can harm. He tells his seventh wife, whom he has just married\r\nafter murdering all her predecessors, "I am immortal, and no one can\r\nhurt me unless he crushes on my breast an egg, which is in a pigeon,\r\nwhich is in the belly of a hare; this hare is in the belly of a\r\nwolf, and this wolf is in the belly of my brother, who dwells a\r\nthousand leagues from here. So I am quite easy on that score." A\r\nsoldier contrived to obtain the egg and crush it on the breast of\r\nthe giant, who immediately expired. In another Breton tale the life\r\nof a giant resides in an old box-tree which grows in his castle\r\ngarden; and to kill him it is necessary to sever the tap-root of the\r\ntree at a single blow of an axe without injuring any of the lesser\r\nroots. This task the hero, as usual, successfully accomplishes, and\r\nat the same moment the giant drops dead.\r\n\r\nThe notion of an external soul has now been traced in folk-tales\r\ntold by Aryan peoples from India to Ireland. We have still to show\r\nthat the same idea occurs commonly in the popular stories of peoples\r\nwho do not belong to the Aryan stock. In the ancient Egyptian tale\r\nof "The Two Brothers," which was written down in the reign of\r\nRameses II., about 1300 B.C., we read how one of the brothers\r\nenchanted his heart and placed it in the flower of an acacia tree,\r\nand how, when the flower was cut at the instigation of his wife, he\r\nimmediately fell down dead, but revived when his brother found the\r\nlost heart in the berry of the acacia and threw it into a cup of\r\nfresh water.\r\n\r\nIn the story of Seyf el-Mulook in the _Arabian Nights_ the jinnee\r\ntells the captive daughter of the King of India, "When I was born,\r\nthe astrologers declared that the destruction of my soul would be\r\neffected by the hand of one of the sons of the human kings. I\r\ntherefore took my soul, and put it into the crop of a sparrow, and I\r\nimprisoned the sparrow in a little box, and put this into another\r\nsmall box, and this I put within seven other small boxes, and I put\r\nthese within seven chests, and the chests I put into a coffer of\r\nmarble within the verge of this circumambient ocean; for this part\r\nis remote from the countries of mankind, and none of mankind can\r\ngain access to it." But Seyf el-Mulook got possession of the sparrow\r\nand strangled it, and the jinnee fell upon the ground a heap of\r\nblack ashes. In a Kabyle story an ogre declares that his fate is far\r\naway in an egg, which is in a pigeon, which is in a camel, which is\r\nin the sea. The hero procures the egg and crushes it between his\r\nhands, and the ogre dies. In a Magyar folk-tale, an old witch\r\ndetains a young prince called Ambrose in the bowels of the earth. At\r\nlast she confided to him that she kept a wild boar in a silken\r\nmeadow, and if it were killed, they would find a hare inside, and\r\ninside the hare a pigeon, and inside the pigeon a small box, and\r\ninside the box one black and one shining beetle: the shining beetle\r\nheld her life, and the black one held her power; if these two\r\nbeetles died, then her life would come to an end also. When the old\r\nhag went out, Ambrose killed the wild boar, and took out the hare;\r\nfrom the hare he took the pigeon, from the pigeon the box, and from\r\nthe box the two beetles; he killed the black beetle, but kept the\r\nshining one alive. So the witch\'s power left her immediately, and\r\nwhen she came home, she had to take to her bed. Having learned from\r\nher how to escape from his prison to the upper air, Ambrose killed\r\nthe shining beetle, and the old hag\'s spirit left her at once. In a\r\nKalmuck tale we read how a certain khan challenged a wise man to\r\nshow his skill by stealing a precious stone on which the khan\'s life\r\ndepended. The sage contrived to purloin the talisman while the khan\r\nand his guards slept; but not content with this he gave a further\r\nproof of his dexterity by bonneting the slumbering potentate with a\r\nbladder. This was too much for the khan. Next morning he informed\r\nthe sage that he could overlook everything else, but that the\r\nindignity of being bonneted with a bladder was more than he could\r\nbear; and he ordered his facetious friend to instant execution.\r\nPained at this exhibition of royal ingratitude, the sage dashed to\r\nthe ground the talisman which he still held in his hand; and at the\r\nsame instant blood flowed from the nostrils of the khan, and he gave\r\nup the ghost.\r\n\r\nIn a Tartar poem two heroes named Ak Molot and Bulat engage in\r\nmortal combat. Ak Molot pierces his foe through and through with an\r\narrow, grapples with him, and dashes him to the ground, but all in\r\nvain, Bulat could not die. At last when the combat has lasted three\r\nyears, a friend of Ak Molot sees a golden casket hanging by a white\r\nthread from the sky, and bethinks him that perhaps this casket\r\ncontains Bulat\'s soul. So he shot through the white thread with an\r\narrow, and down fell the casket. He opened it, and in the casket sat\r\nten white birds, and one of the birds was Bulat\'s soul. Bulat wept\r\nwhen he saw that his soul was found in the casket. But one after the\r\nother the birds were killed, and then Ak Molot easily slew his foe.\r\nIn another Tartar poem, two brothers going to fight two other\r\nbrothers take out their souls and hide them in the form of a white\r\nherb with six stalks in a deep pit. But one of their foes sees them\r\ndoing so and digs up their souls, which he puts into a golden ram\'s\r\nhorn, and then sticks the ram\'s horn in his quiver. The two warriors\r\nwhose souls have thus been stolen know that they have no chance of\r\nvictory, and accordingly make peace with their enemies. In another\r\nTartar poem a terrible demon sets all the gods and heroes at\r\ndefiance. At last a valiant youth fights the demon, binds him hand\r\nand foot, and slices him with his sword. But still the demon is not\r\nslain. So the youth asked him, "Tell me, where is your soul hidden?\r\nFor if your soul had been hidden in your body, you must have been\r\ndead long ago." The demon replied, "On the saddle of my horse is a\r\nbag. In the bag is a serpent with twelve heads. In the serpent is my\r\nsoul. When you have killed the serpent, you have killed me also." So\r\nthe youth took the saddle-bag from the horse and killed the\r\ntwelve-headed serpent, whereupon the demon expired. In another\r\nTartar poem a hero called K\xf6k Chan deposits with a maiden a golden\r\nring, in which is half his strength. Afterwards when K\xf6k Chan is\r\nwrestling long with a hero and cannot kill him, a woman drops into\r\nhis mouth the ring which contains half his strength. Thus inspired\r\nwith fresh force he slays his enemy.\r\n\r\nIn a Mongolian story the hero Joro gets the better of his enemy the\r\nlama Tschoridong in the following way. The lama, who is an\r\nenchanter, sends out his soul in the form of a wasp to sting Joro\'s\r\neyes. But Joro catches the wasp in his hand, and by alternately\r\nshutting and opening his hand he causes the lama alternately to lose\r\nand recover consciousness. In a Tartar poem two youths cut open the\r\nbody of an old witch and tear out her bowels, but all to no purpose,\r\nshe still lives. On being asked where her soul is, she answers that\r\nit is in the middle of her shoe-sole in the form of a seven-headed\r\nspeckled snake. So one of the youths slices her shoe-sole with his\r\nsword, takes out the speckled snake, and cuts off its seven heads.\r\nThen the witch dies. Another Tartar poem describes how the hero\r\nKartaga grappled with the Swan-woman. Long they wrestled. Moons\r\nwaxed and waned and still they wrestled; years came and went, and\r\nstill the struggle went on. But the piebald horse and the black\r\nhorse knew that the Swan-woman\'s soul was not in her. Under the\r\nblack earth flow nine seas; where the seas meet and form one, the\r\nsea comes to the surface of the earth. At the mouth of the nine seas\r\nrises a rock of copper; it rises to the surface of the ground, it\r\nrises up between heaven and earth, this rock of copper. At the foot\r\nof the copper rock is a black chest, in the black chest is a golden\r\ncasket, and in the golden casket is the soul of the Swan-woman.\r\nSeven little birds are the soul of the Swan-woman; if the birds are\r\nkilled the Swan-woman will die straightway. So the horses ran to the\r\nfoot of the copper rock, opened the black chest, and brought back\r\nthe golden casket. Then the piebald horse turned himself into a\r\nbald-headed man, opened the golden casket, and cut off the heads of\r\nthe seven birds. So the Swan-woman died. In another Tartar poem the\r\nhero, pursuing his sister who has driven away his cattle, is warned\r\nto desist from the pursuit because his sister has carried away his\r\nsoul in a golden sword and a golden arrow, and if he pursues her she\r\nwill kill him by throwing the golden sword or shooting the golden\r\narrow at him.\r\n\r\nA Malay poem relates how once upon a time in the city of Indrapoora\r\nthere was a certain merchant who was rich and prosperous, but he had\r\nno children. One day as he walked with his wife by the river they\r\nfound a baby girl, fair as an angel. So they adopted the child and\r\ncalled her Bidasari. The merchant caused a golden fish to be made,\r\nand into this fish he transferred the soul of his adopted daughter.\r\nThen he put the golden fish in a golden box full of water, and hid\r\nit in a pond in the midst of his garden. In time the girl grew to be\r\na lovely woman. Now the King of Indrapoora had a fair young queen,\r\nwho lived in fear that the king might take to himself a second wife.\r\nSo, hearing of the charms of Bidasari, the queen resolved to put her\r\nout of the way. She lured the girl to the palace and tortured her\r\ncruelly; but Bidasari could not die, because her soul was not in\r\nher. At last she could stand the torture no longer and said to the\r\nqueen, "If you wish me to die, you must bring the box which is in\r\nthe pond in my father\'s garden." So the box was brought and opened,\r\nand there was the golden fish in the water. The girl said, "My soul\r\nis in that fish. In the morning you must take the fish out of the\r\nwater, and in the evening you must put it back into the water. Do\r\nnot let the fish lie about, but bind it round your neck. If you do\r\nthis, I shall soon die." So the queen took the fish out of the box\r\nand fastened it round her neck; and no sooner had she done so than\r\nBidasari fell into a swoon. But in the evening, when the fish was\r\nput back into the water, Bidasari came to herself again. Seeing that\r\nshe thus had the girl in her power, the queen sent her home to her\r\nadopted parents. To save her from further persecution her parents\r\nresolved to remove their daughter from the city. So in a lonely and\r\ndesolate spot they built a house and brought Bidasari thither. There\r\nshe dwelt alone, undergoing vicissitudes that corresponded with the\r\nvicissitudes of the golden fish in which was her soul. All day long,\r\nwhile the fish was out of the water, she remained unconscious; but\r\nin the evening, when the fish was put into the water, she revived.\r\nOne day the king was out hunting, and coming to the house where\r\nBidasari lay unconscious, was smitten with her beauty. He tried to\r\nwaken her, but in vain. Next day, towards evening, he repeated his\r\nvisit, but still found her unconscious. However, when darkness fell,\r\nshe came to herself and told the king the secret of her life. So the\r\nking returned to the palace, took the fish from the queen, and put\r\nit in water. Immediately Bidasari revived, and the king took her to\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nAnother story of an external soul comes from Nias, an island to the\r\nwest of Sumatra. Once on a time a chief was captured by his enemies,\r\nwho tried to put him to death but failed. Water would not drown him\r\nnor fire burn him nor steel pierce him. At last his wife revealed\r\nthe secret. On his head he had a hair as hard as a copper wire; and\r\nwith this wire his life was bound up. So the hair was plucked out,\r\nand with it his spirit fled.\r\n\r\nA West African story from Southern Nigeria relates how a king kept\r\nhis soul in a little brown bird, which perched on a tall tree beside\r\nthe gate of the palace. The king\'s life was so bound up with that of\r\nthe bird that whoever should kill the bird would simultaneously kill\r\nthe king and succeed to the kingdom. The secret was betrayed by the\r\nqueen to her lover, who shot the bird with an arrow and thereby slew\r\nthe king and ascended the vacant throne. A tale told by the Ba-Ronga\r\nof South Africa sets forth how the lives of a whole family were\r\ncontained in one cat. When a girl of the family, named Titishan,\r\nmarried a husband, she begged her parents to let her take the\r\nprecious cat with her to her new home. But they refused, saying,\r\n"You know that our life is attached to it"; and they offered to give\r\nher an antelope or even an elephant instead of it. But nothing would\r\nsatisfy her but the cat. So at last she carried it off with her and\r\nshut it up in a place where nobody saw it; even her husband knew\r\nnothing about it. One day, when she went to work in the fields, the\r\ncat escaped from its place of concealment, entered the hut, put on\r\nthe warlike trappings of the husband, and danced and sang. Some\r\nchildren, attracted by the noise, discovered the cat at its antics,\r\nand when they expressed their astonishment, the animal only capered\r\nthe more and insulted them besides. So they went to the owner and\r\nsaid, "There is somebody dancing in your house, and he insulted us."\r\n"Hold your tongues," said he, "I\'ll soon put a stop to your lies."\r\nSo he went and hid behind the door and peeped in, and there sure\r\nenough was the cat prancing about and singing. He fired at it, and\r\nthe animal dropped down dead. At the same moment his wife fell to\r\nthe ground in the field where she was at work; said she, "I have\r\nbeen killed at home." But she had strength enough left to ask her\r\nhusband to go with her to her parents\' village, taking with him the\r\ndead cat wrapt up in a mat. All her relatives assembled, and\r\nbitterly they reproached her for having insisted on taking the\r\nanimal with her to her husband\'s village. As soon as the mat was\r\nunrolled and they saw the dead cat, they all fell down lifeless one\r\nafter the other. So the Clan of the Cat was destroyed; and the\r\nbereaved husband closed the gate of the village with a branch, and\r\nreturned home, and told his friends how in killing the cat he had\r\nkilled the whole clan, because their lives depended on the life of\r\nthe cat.\r\n\r\nIdeas of the same sort meet us in stories told by the North American\r\nIndians. Thus the Navajoes tell of a certain mythical being called\r\n"the Maiden that becomes a Bear," who learned the art of turning\r\nherself into a bear from the prairie wolf. She was a great warrior\r\nand quite invulnerable; for when she went to war she took out her\r\nvital organs and hid them, so that no one could kill her; and when\r\nthe battle was over she put the organs back in their places again.\r\nThe Kwakiutl Indians of British Columbia tell of an ogress, who\r\ncould not be killed because her life was in a hemlock branch. A\r\nbrave boy met her in the woods, smashed her head with a stone,\r\nscattered her brains, broke her bones, and threw them into the\r\nwater. Then, thinking he had disposed of the ogress, he went into\r\nher house. There he saw a woman rooted to the floor, who warned him,\r\nsaying, "Now do not stay long. I know that you have tried to kill\r\nthe ogress. It is the fourth time that somebody has tried to kill\r\nher. She never dies; she has nearly come to life. There in that\r\ncovered hemlock branch is her life. Go there, and as soon as you see\r\nher enter, shoot her life. Then she will be dead." Hardly had she\r\nfinished speaking when sure enough in came the ogress, singing as\r\nshe walked. But the boy shot at her life, and she fell dead to the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVII. The External Soul in Folk-Custom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The External Soul in Inanimate Things\r\n\r\nTHUS the idea that the soul may be deposited for a longer or shorter\r\ntime in some place of security outside the body, or at all events in\r\nthe hair, is found in the popular tales of many races. It remains to\r\nshow that the idea is not a mere figment devised to adorn a tale,\r\nbut is a real article of primitive faith, which has given rise to a\r\ncorresponding set of customs.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in the tales the hero, as a preparation for\r\nbattle, sometimes removes his soul from his body, in order that his\r\nbody may be invulnerable and immortal in the combat. With a like\r\nintention the savage removes his soul from his body on various\r\noccasions of real or imaginary peril. Thus among the people of\r\nMinahassa in Celebes, when a family moves into a new house, a priest\r\ncollects the souls of the whole family in a bag, and afterwards\r\nrestores them to their owners, because the moment of entering a new\r\nhouse is supposed to be fraught with supernatural danger. In\r\nSouthern Celebes, when a woman is brought to bed, the messenger who\r\nfetches the doctor or the midwife always carries with him something\r\nmade of iron, such as a chopping-knife, which he delivers to the\r\ndoctor. The doctor must keep the thing in his house till the\r\nconfinement is over, when he gives it back, receiving a fixed sum of\r\nmoney for doing so. The chopping-knife, or whatever it is,\r\nrepresents the woman\'s soul, which at this critical time is believed\r\nto be safer out of her body than in it. Hence the doctor must take\r\ngreat care of the object; for were it lost, the woman\'s soul would\r\nassuredly, they think, be lost with it.\r\n\r\nAmong the Dyaks of Pinoeh, a district of South-eastern Borneo, when\r\na child is born, a medicine-man is sent for, who conjures the soul\r\nof the infant into half a coco-nut, which he thereupon covers with a\r\ncloth and places on a square platter or charger suspended by cords\r\nfrom the roof. This ceremony he repeats at every new moon for a\r\nyear. The intention of the ceremony is not explained by the writer\r\nwho describes it, but we may conjecture that it is to place the soul\r\nof the child in a safer place than its own frail little body. This\r\nconjecture is confirmed by the reason assigned for a similar custom\r\nobserved elsewhere in the Indian Archipelago. In the Kei Islands,\r\nwhen there is a newly-born child in a house, an empty coco-nut,\r\nsplit and spliced together again, may sometimes be seen hanging\r\nbeside a rough wooden image of an ancestor. The soul of the infant\r\nis believed to be temporarily deposited in the coco-nut in order\r\nthat it may be safe from the attacks of evil spirits; but when the\r\nchild grows bigger and stronger, the soul will take up its permanent\r\nabode in its own body. Similarly among the Esquimaux of Alaska, when\r\na child is sick, the medicine-man will sometimes extract its soul\r\nfrom its body and place it for safe-keeping in an amulet, which for\r\nfurther security he deposits in his own medicine-bag. It seems\r\nprobable that many amulets have been similarly regarded as\r\nsoul-boxes, that is, as safes in which the souls of the owners are\r\nkept for greater security. An old Mang\'anje woman in the West Shire\r\ndistrict of British Central Africa used to wear round her neck an\r\nivory ornament, hollow, and about three inches long, which she\r\ncalled her life or soul. Naturally, she would not part with it; a\r\nplanter tried to buy it of her, but in vain. When Mr. James\r\nMacdonald was one day sitting in the house of a Hlubi chief,\r\nawaiting the appearance of that great man, who was busy decorating\r\nhis person, a native pointed to a pair of magnificent ox-horns, and\r\nsaid, "Ntame has his soul in these horns." The horns were those of\r\nan animal which had been sacrificed, and they were held sacred. A\r\nmagician had fastened them to the roof to protect the house and its\r\ninmates from the thunder-bolt. "The idea," adds Mr. Macdonald, "is\r\nin no way foreign to South African thought. A man\'s soul there may\r\ndwell in the roof of his house, in a tree, by a spring of water, or\r\non some mountain scaur." Among the natives of the Gazelle Peninsula\r\nin New Britain there is a secret society which goes by the name of\r\nIngniet or Ingiet. On his entrance into it every man receives a\r\nstone in the shape either of a human being or of an animal, and\r\nhenceforth his soul is believed to be knit up in a manner with the\r\nstone. If it breaks, it is an evil omen for him; they say that the\r\nthunder has struck the stone and that he who owns it will soon die.\r\nIf nevertheless the man survives the breaking of his soul-stone,\r\nthey say that it was not a proper soul-stone and he gets a new one\r\ninstead. The emperor Romanus Lecapenus was once informed by an\r\nastronomer that the life of Simeon, prince of Bulgaria, was bound up\r\nwith a certain column in Constantinople, so that if the capital of\r\nthe column were removed, Simeon would immediately die. The emperor\r\ntook the hint and removed the capital, and at the same hour, as the\r\nemperor learned by enquiry, Simeon died of heart disease in\r\nBulgaria.\r\n\r\nAgain, we have seen that in folk-tales a man\'s soul or strength is\r\nsometimes represented as bound up with his hair, and that when his\r\nhair is cut off he dies or grows weak. So the natives of Amboyna\r\nused to think that their strength was in their hair and would desert\r\nthem if it were shorn. A criminal under torture in a Dutch Court of\r\nthat island persisted in denying his guilt till his hair was cut\r\noff, when he immediately confessed. One man, who was tried for\r\nmurder, endured without flinching the utmost ingenuity of his\r\ntorturers till he saw the surgeon standing with a pair of shears. On\r\nasking what this was for, and being told that it was to cut his\r\nhair, he begged they would not do it, and made a clean breast. In\r\nsubsequent cases, when torture failed to wring a confession from a\r\nprisoner, the Dutch authorities made a practice of cutting off his\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nHere in Europe it used to be thought that the maleficent powers of\r\nwitches and wizards resided in their hair, and that nothing could\r\nmake any impression on the miscreants so long as they kept their\r\nhair on. Hence in France it was customary to shave the whole bodies\r\nof persons charged with sorcery before handing them over to the\r\ntorturer. Millaeus witnessed the torture of some persons at\r\nToulouse, from whom no confession could be wrung until they were\r\nstripped and completely shaven, when they readily acknowledged the\r\ntruth of the charge. A woman also, who apparently led a pious life,\r\nwas put to the torture on suspicion of witchcraft, and bore her\r\nagonies with incredible constancy, until complete depilation drove\r\nher to admit her guilt. The noted inquisitor Sprenger contented\r\nhimself with shaving the head of the suspected witch or wizard; but\r\nhis more thoroughgoing colleague Cumanus shaved the whole bodies of\r\nforty-seven women before committing them all to the flames. He had\r\nhigh authority for this rigorous scrutiny, since Satan himself, in a\r\nsermon preached from the pulpit of North Berwick church, comforted\r\nhis many servants by assuring them that no harm could befall them\r\n"sa lang as their hair wes on, and sould newir latt ane teir fall\r\nfra thair ene." Similarly in Bastar, a province of India, "if a man\r\nis adjudged guilty of witchcraft, he is beaten by the crowd, his\r\nhair is shaved, the hair being supposed to constitute his power of\r\nmischief, his front teeth are knocked out, in order, it is said, to\r\nprevent him from muttering incantations. . . . Women suspected of\r\nsorcery have to undergo the same ordeal; if found guilty, the same\r\npunishment is awarded, and after being shaved, their hair is\r\nattached to a tree in some public place." So among the Bhils of\r\nIndia, when a woman was convicted of witchcraft and had been\r\nsubjected to various forms of persuasion, such as hanging head\r\ndownwards from a tree and having pepper put into her eyes, a lock of\r\nhair was cut from her head and buried in the ground, "that the last\r\nlink between her and her former powers of mischief might be broken."\r\nIn like manner among the Aztecs of Mexico, when wizards and witches\r\n"had done their evil deeds, and the time came to put an end to their\r\ndetestable life, some one laid hold of them and cropped the hair on\r\nthe crown of their heads, which took from them all their power of\r\nsorcery and enchantment, and then it was that by death they put an\r\nend to their odious existence."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The External Soul in Plants\r\n\r\nFURTHER it has been shown that in folk-tales the life of a person is\r\nsometimes so bound up with the life of a plant that the withering of\r\nthe plant will immediately follow or be followed by the death of the\r\nperson. Among the M\'Bengas in Western Africa, about the Gaboon, when\r\ntwo children are born on the same day, the people plant two trees of\r\nthe same kind and dance round them. The life of each of the children\r\nis believed to be bound up with the life of one of the trees; and if\r\nthe tree dies or is thrown down, they are sure that the child will\r\nsoon die. In the Cameroons, also, the life of a person is believed\r\nto be sympathetically bound up with that of a tree. The chief of Old\r\nTown in Calabar kept his soul in a sacred grove near a spring of\r\nwater. When some Europeans, in frolic or ignorance, cut down part of\r\nthe grove, the spirit was most indignant and threatened the\r\nperpetrators of the deed, according to the king, with all manner of\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nSome of the Papuans unite the life of a new-born babe\r\nsympathetically with that of a tree by driving a pebble into the\r\nbark of the tree. This is supposed to give them complete mastery\r\nover the child\'s life; if the tree is cut down, the child will die.\r\nAfter a birth the Maoris used to bury the navel-string in a sacred\r\nplace and plant a young sapling over it. As the tree grew, it was a\r\n_tohu oranga_ or sign of life for the child; if it flourished, the\r\nchild would prosper; if it withered and died, the parents augured\r\nthe worst for the little one. In some parts of Fiji the navel-string\r\nof a male infant is planted together with a coco-nut or the slip of\r\na breadfruit-tree, and the child\'s life is supposed to be intimately\r\nconnected with that of the tree. Amongst the Dyaks of Landak and\r\nTajan, districts of Dutch Borneo, it is customary to plant a\r\nfruit-tree for a baby, and henceforth in the popular belief the fate\r\nof the child is bound up with that of the tree. If the tree shoots\r\nup rapidly, it will go well with the child; but if the tree is\r\ndwarfed or shrivelled, nothing but misfortune can be expected for\r\nits human counterpart.\r\n\r\nIt is said that there are still families in Russia, Germany,\r\nEngland, France, and Italy who are accustomed to plant a tree at the\r\nbirth of a child. The tree, it is hoped, will grow with the child,\r\nand it is tended with special care. The custom is still pretty\r\ngeneral in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland; an apple-tree is\r\nplanted for a boy and a pear-tree for a girl, and the people think\r\nthat the child will flourish or dwindle with the tree. In\r\nMecklenburg the afterbirth is thrown out at the foot of a young\r\ntree, and the child is then believed to grow with the tree. Near the\r\nCastle of Dalhousie, not far from Edinburgh, there grows an\r\noak-tree, called the Edgewell Tree, which is popularly believed to\r\nbe linked to the fate of the family by a mysterious tie; for they\r\nsay that when one of the family dies, or is about to die, a branch\r\nfalls from the Edgewell Tree. Thus, on seeing a great bough drop\r\nfrom the tree on a quiet, still day in July 1874, an old forester\r\nexclaimed, "The laird\'s deid noo!" and soon after news came that Fox\r\nMaule, eleventh Earl of Dalhousie, was dead.\r\n\r\nIn England children are sometimes passed through a cleft ash-tree as\r\na cure for rupture or rickets, and thenceforward a sympathetic\r\nconnexion is supposed to exist between them and the tree. An\r\nash-tree which had been used for this purpose grew at the edge of\r\nShirley Heath, on the road from Hockly House to Birmingham. "Thomas\r\nChillingworth, son of the owner of an adjoining farm, now about\r\nthirty-four, was, when an infant of a year old, passed through a\r\nsimilar tree, now perfectly sound, which he preserves with so much\r\ncare that he will not suffer a single branch to be touched, for it\r\nis believed the life of the patient depends on the life of the tree,\r\nand the moment that is cut down, be the patient ever so distant, the\r\nrupture returns, and a mortification ensues, and terminates in\r\ndeath, as was the case in a man driving a waggon on the very road in\r\nquestion." "It is not uncommon, however," adds the writer, "for\r\npersons to survive for a time the felling of the tree." The ordinary\r\nmode of effecting the cure is to split a young ash-sapling\r\nlongitudinally for a few feet and pass the child, naked, either\r\nthree times or three times three through the fissure at sunrise. In\r\nthe West of England it is said that the passage should be "against\r\nthe sun." As soon as the ceremony has been performed, the tree is\r\nbound tightly up and the fissure plastered over with mud or clay.\r\nThe belief is that just as the cleft in the tree closes up, so the\r\nrupture in the child\'s body will be healed; but that if the rift in\r\nthe tree remains open, the rupture in the child will remain too, and\r\nif the tree were to die, the death of the child would surely follow.\r\n\r\nA similar cure for various diseases, but especially for rupture and\r\nrickets, has been commonly practised in other parts of Europe, as\r\nGermany, France, Denmark, and Sweden; but in these countries the\r\ntree employed for the purpose is usually not an ash but an oak;\r\nsometimes a willow-tree is allowed or even prescribed instead. In\r\nMecklenburg, as in England, the sympathetic relation thus\r\nestablished between the tree and the child is believed to be so\r\nclose that if the tree is cut down the child will die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The External Soul in Animals\r\n\r\nBUT in practice, as in folk-tales, it is not merely with inanimate\r\nobjects and plants that a person is occasionally believed to be\r\nunited by a bond of physical sympathy. The same bond, it is\r\nsupposed, may exist between a man and an animal, so that the welfare\r\nof the one depends on the welfare of the other, and when the animal\r\ndies the man dies also. The analogy between the custom and the tales\r\nis all the closer because in both of them the power of thus removing\r\nthe soul from the body and stowing it away in an animal is often a\r\nspecial privilege of wizards and witches. Thus the Yakuts of Siberia\r\nbelieve that every shaman or wizard keeps his soul, or one of his\r\nsouls, incarnate in an animal which is carefully concealed from all\r\nthe world. "Nobody can find my external soul," said one famous\r\nwizard, "it lies hidden far away in the stony mountains of\r\nEdzhigansk." Only once a year, when the last snows melt and the\r\nearth turns black, do these external souls of wizards appear in the\r\nshape of animals among the dwellings of men. They wander everywhere,\r\nyet none but wizards can see them. The strong ones sweep roaring and\r\nnoisily along, the weak steal about quietly and furtively. Often\r\nthey fight, and then the wizard whose external soul is beaten, falls\r\nill or dies. The weakest and most cowardly wizards are they whose\r\nsouls are incarnate in the shape of dogs, for the dog gives his\r\nhuman double no peace, but gnaws his heart and tears his body. The\r\nmost powerful wizards are they whose external souls have the shape\r\nof stallions, elks, black bears, eagles, or boars. Again, the\r\nSamoyeds of the Turukhinsk region hold that every shaman has a\r\nfamiliar spirit in the shape of a boar, which he leads about by a\r\nmagic belt. On the death of the boar the shaman himself dies; and\r\nstories are told of battles between wizards, who send their spirits\r\nto fight before they encounter each other in person. The Malays\r\nbelieve that "the soul of a person may pass into another person or\r\ninto an animal, or rather that such a mysterious relation can arise\r\nbetween the two that the fate of the one is wholly dependent on that\r\nof the other."\r\n\r\nAmong the Melanesians of Mota, one of the New Hebrides islands, the\r\nconception of an external soul is carried out in the practice of\r\ndaily life. In the Mota language the word _tamaniu_ signifies\r\n"something animate or inanimate which a man has come to believe to\r\nhave an existence intimately connected with his own. . . . It was\r\nnot every one in Mota who had his _tamaniu;_ only some men fancied\r\nthat they had this relation to a lizard, a snake, or it might be a\r\nstone; sometimes the thing was sought for and found by drinking the\r\ninfusion of certain leaves and heaping together the dregs; then\r\nwhatever living thing was first seen in or upon the heap was the\r\n_tamaniu._ It was watched but not fed or worshipped; the natives\r\nbelieved that it came at call, and that the life of the man was\r\nbound up with the life of his _tamaniu,_ if a living thing, or with\r\nits safety; should it die, or if not living get broken or be lost,\r\nthe man would die. Hence in case of sickness they would send to see\r\nif the _tamaniu_ was safe and well."\r\n\r\nThe theory of an external soul deposited in an animal appears to be\r\nvery prevalent in West Africa, particularly in Nigeria, the\r\nCameroons, and the Gaboon. Among the Fans of the Gaboon every wizard\r\nis believed at initiation to unite his life with that of some\r\nparticular wild animal by a rite of blood-brotherhood; he draws\r\nblood from the ear of the animal and from his own arm, and\r\ninoculates the animal with his own blood, and himself with the blood\r\nof the beast. Henceforth such an intimate union is established\r\nbetween the two that the death of the one entails the death of the\r\nother. The alliance is thought to bring to the wizard or sorcerer a\r\ngreat accession of power, which he can turn to his advantage in\r\nvarious ways. In the first place, like the warlock in the fairy\r\ntales who has deposited his life outside of himself in some safe\r\nplace, the Fan wizard now deems himself invulnerable. Moreover, the\r\nanimal with which he has exchanged blood has become his familiar,\r\nand will obey any orders he may choose to give it; so he makes use\r\nof it to injure and kill his enemies. For that reason the creature\r\nwith whom he establishes the relation of blood-brotherhood is never\r\na tame or domestic animal, but always a ferocious and dangerous wild\r\nbeast, such as a leopard, a black serpent, a crocodile, a\r\nhippopotamus, a wild boar, or a vulture. Of all these creatures the\r\nleopard is by far the commonest familiar of Fan wizards, and next to\r\nit comes the black serpent; the vulture is the rarest. Witches as\r\nwell as wizards have their familiars; but the animals with which the\r\nlives of women are thus bound up generally differ from those to\r\nwhich men commit their external souls. A witch never has a panther\r\nfor her familiar, but often a venomous species of serpent, sometimes\r\na horned viper, sometimes a black serpent, sometimes a green one\r\nthat lives in banana-trees; or it may be a vulture, an owl, or other\r\nbird of night. In every case the beast or bird with which the witch\r\nor wizard has contracted this mystic alliance is an individual,\r\nnever a species; and when the individual animal dies the alliance is\r\nnaturally at an end, since the death of the animal is supposed to\r\nentail the death of the man.\r\n\r\nSimilar beliefs are held by the natives of the Cross River valley\r\nwithin the provinces of the Cameroons. Groups of people, generally\r\nthe inhabitants of a village, have chosen various animals, with\r\nwhich they believe themselves to stand on a footing of intimate\r\nfriendship or relationship. Amongst such animals are hippopotamuses,\r\nelephants, leopards, crocodiles, gorillas, fish, and serpents, all\r\nof them creatures which are either very strong or can easily hide\r\nthemselves in the water or a thicket. This power of concealing\r\nthemselves is said to be an indispensable condition of the choice of\r\nanimal familiars, since the animal friend or helper is expected to\r\ninjure his owner\'s enemy by stealth; for example, if he is a\r\nhippopotamus, he will bob up suddenly out of the water and capsize\r\nthe enemy\'s canoe. Between the animals and their human friends or\r\nkinsfolk such a sympathetic relation is supposed to exist that the\r\nmoment the animal dies the man dies also, and similarly the instant\r\nthe man perishes so does the beast. From this it follows that the\r\nanimal kinsfolk may never be shot at or molested for fear of\r\ninjuring or killing the persons whose lives are knit up with the\r\nlives of the brutes. This does not, however, prevent the people of a\r\nvillage, who have elephants for their animal friends, from hunting\r\nelephants. For they do not respect the whole species but merely\r\ncertain individuals of it, which stand in an intimate relation to\r\ncertain individual men and women; and they imagine that they can\r\nalways distinguish these brother elephants from the common herd of\r\nelephants which are mere elephants and nothing more. The recognition\r\nindeed is said to be mutual. When a hunter, who has an elephant for\r\nhis friend, meets a human elephant, as we may call it, the noble\r\nanimal lifts up a paw and holds it before his face, as much as to\r\nsay, "Don\'t shoot." Were the hunter so inhuman as to fire on and\r\nwound such an elephant, the person whose life was bound up with the\r\nelephant would fall ill.\r\n\r\nThe Balong of the Cameroons think that every man has several souls,\r\nof which one is in his body and another in an animal, such as an\r\nelephant, a wild pig, a leopard, and so forth. When a man comes\r\nhome, feeling ill, and says, "I shall soon die," and dies\r\naccordingly, the people aver that one of his souls has been killed\r\nin a wild pig or a leopard and that the death of the external soul\r\nhas caused the death of the soul in his body. A similar belief in\r\nthe external souls of living people is entertained by the Ibos, an\r\nimportant tribe of the Niger delta. They think that a man\'s spirit\r\ncan quit his body for a time during life and take up its abode in an\r\nanimal. A man who wishes to acquire this power procures a certain\r\ndrug from a wise man and mixes it with his food. After that his soul\r\ngoes out and enters into an animal. If it should happen that the\r\nanimal is killed while the man\'s soul is lodged in it, the man dies;\r\nand if the animal be wounded, the man\'s body will presently be\r\ncovered with boils. This belief instigates to many deeds of\r\ndarkness; for a sly rogue will sometimes surreptitiously administer\r\nthe magical drug to his enemy in his food, and having thus smuggled\r\nthe other\'s soul into an animal will destroy the creature, and with\r\nit the man whose soul is lodged in it.\r\n\r\nThe negroes of Calabar, at the mouth of the Niger, believe that\r\nevery person has four souls, one of which always lives outside of\r\nhis or her body in the form of a wild beast in the forest. This\r\nexternal soul, or bush soul, as Miss Kingsley calls it, may be\r\nalmost any animal, for example, a leopard, a fish, or a tortoise;\r\nbut it is never a domestic animal and never a plant. Unless he is\r\ngifted with second sight, a man cannot see his own bush soul, but a\r\ndiviner will often tell him what sort of creature his bush soul is,\r\nand after that the man will be careful not to kill any animal of\r\nthat species, and will strongly object to any one else doing so. A\r\nman and his sons have usually the same sort of animals for their\r\nbush souls, and so with a mother and her daughters. But sometimes\r\nall the children of a family take after the bush soul of their\r\nfather; for example, if his external soul is a leopard, all his sons\r\nand daughters will have leopards for their external souls. And on\r\nthe other hand, sometimes they all take after their mother; for\r\ninstance, if her external soul is a tortoise, all the external souls\r\nof her sons and daughters will be tortoises too. So intimately bound\r\nup is the life of the man with that of the animal which he regards\r\nas his external or bush soul, that the death or injury of the animal\r\nnecessarily entails the death or injury of the man. And, conversely,\r\nwhen the man dies, his bush soul can no longer find a place of rest,\r\nbut goes mad and rushes into the fire or charges people and is\r\nknocked on the head, and that is an end of it.\r\n\r\nNear Eket in North Calabar there is a sacred lake, the fish of which\r\nare carefully preserved because the people believe that their own\r\nsouls are lodged in the fish, and that with every fish killed a\r\nhuman life would be simultaneously extinguished. In the Calabar\r\nRiver not very many years ago there used to be a huge old crocodile,\r\npopularly supposed to contain the external soul of a chief who\r\nresided in the flesh at Duke Town. Sporting vice-consuls used from\r\ntime to time to hunt the animal, and once an officer contrived to\r\nhit it. Forthwith the chief was laid up with a wound in his leg. He\r\ngave out that a dog had bitten him, but no doubt the wise shook\r\ntheir heads and refused to be put off with so flimsy a pretext.\r\nAgain, among several tribes on the banks of the Niger between Lokoja\r\nand the delta there prevails "a belief in the possibility of a man\r\npossessing an _alter ego_ in the form of some animal such as a\r\ncrocodile or a hippopotamus. It is believed that such a person\'s\r\nlife is bound up with that of the animal to such an extent that,\r\nwhatever affects the one produces a corresponding impression upon\r\nthe other, and that if one dies the other must speedily do so too.\r\nIt happened not very long ago that an Englishman shot a hippopotamus\r\nclose to a native village; the friends of a woman who died the same\r\nnight in the village demanded and eventually obtained five pounds as\r\ncompensation for the murder of the woman."\r\n\r\nAmongst the Zapotecs of Central America, when a woman was about to\r\nbe confined, her relations assembled in the hut, and began to draw\r\non the floor figures of different animals, rubbing each one out as\r\nsoon as it was completed. This went on till the moment of birth, and\r\nthe figure that then remained sketched upon the ground was called\r\nthe child\'s _tona_ or second self. "When the child grew old enough,\r\nhe procured the animal that represented him and took care of it, as\r\nit was believed that health and existence were bound up with that of\r\nthe animal\'s, in fact that the death of both would occur\r\nsimultaneously," or rather that when the animal died the man would\r\ndie too. Among the Indians of Guatemala and Honduras the _nagual_ or\r\n_naual_ is "that animate or inanimate object, generally an animal,\r\nwhich stands in a parallel relation to a particular man, so that the\r\nweal and woe of the man depend on the fate of the _nagual._"\r\nAccording to an old writer, many Indians of Guatemala "are deluded\r\nby the devil to believe that their life dependeth upon the life of\r\nsuch and such a beast (which they take unto them as their familiar\r\nspirit), and think that when that beast dieth they must die; when he\r\nis chased, their hearts pant; when he is faint, they are faint; nay,\r\nit happeneth that by the devil\'s delusion they appear in the shape\r\nof that beast (which commonly by their choice is a buck, or doe, a\r\nlion, or tigre, or dog, or eagle) and in that shape have been shot\r\nat and wounded." The Indians were persuaded that the death of their\r\n_nagual_ would entail their own. Legend affirms that in the first\r\nbattles with the Spaniards on the plateau of Quetzaltenango the\r\n_naguals_ of the Indian chiefs fought in the form of serpents. The\r\n_nagual_ of the highest chief was especially conspicuous, because it\r\nhad the form of a great bird, resplendent in green plumage. The\r\nSpanish general Pedro de Alvarado killed the bird with his lance,\r\nand at the same moment the Indian chief fell dead to the ground.\r\n\r\nIn many tribes of South-Eastern Australia each sex used to regard a\r\nparticular species of animals in the same way that a Central\r\nAmerican Indian regarded his _nagual,_ but with this difference,\r\nthat whereas the Indian apparently knew the individual animal with\r\nwhich his life was bound up, the Australians only knew that each of\r\ntheir lives was bound up with some one animal of the species, but\r\nthey could not say with which. The result naturally was that every\r\nman spared and protected all the animals of the species with which\r\nthe lives of the men were bound up; and every woman spared and\r\nprotected all the animals of the species with which the lives of the\r\nwomen were bound up; because no one knew but that the death of any\r\nanimal of the respective species might entail his or her own; just\r\nas the killing of the green bird was immediately followed by the\r\ndeath of the Indian chief, and the killing of the parrot by the\r\ndeath of Punchkin in the fairy tale. Thus, for example, the\r\nWotjobaluk tribe of South-Eastern Australia "held that \'the life of\r\nNgunungunut (the Bat) is the life of a man, and the life of\r\nY\xe1rtatgurk (the Nightjar) is the life of a woman,\' and that when\r\neither of these creatures is killed the life of some man or of some\r\nwoman is shortened. In such a case every man or every woman in the\r\ncamp feared that he or she might be the victim, and from this cause\r\ngreat fights arose in this tribe. I learn that in these fights, men\r\non one side and women on the other, it was not at all certain which\r\nwould be victorious, for at times the women gave the men a severe\r\ndrubbing with their yamsticks, while often women were injured or\r\nkilled by spears." The Wotjobaluk said that the bat was the man\'s\r\n"brother" and that the nightjar was his "wife." The particular\r\nspecies of animals with which the lives of the sexes were believed\r\nto be respectively bound up varied somewhat from tribe to tribe.\r\nThus whereas among the Wotjobaluk the bat was the animal of the men,\r\nat Gunbower Creek on the Lower Murray the bat seems to have been the\r\nanimal of the women, for the natives would not kill it for the\r\nreason that "if it was killed, one of their lubras [women] would be\r\nsure to die in consequence." But whatever the particular sorts of\r\ncreature with which the lives of men and women were believed to be\r\nbound up, the belief itself and the fights to which it gave rise are\r\nknown to have prevailed over a large part of South-Eastern\r\nAustralia, and probably they extended much farther. The belief was a\r\nvery serious one, and so consequently were the fights which sprang\r\nfrom it. Thus among some tribes of Victoria "the common bat belongs\r\nto the men, who protect it against injury, even to the half-killing\r\nof their wives for its sake. The fern owl, or large goatsucker,\r\nbelongs to the women, and, although a bird of evil omen, creating\r\nterror at night by its cry, it is jealously protected by them. If a\r\nman kills one, they are as much enraged as if it was one of their\r\nchildren, and will strike him with their long poles."\r\n\r\nThe jealous protection thus afforded by Australian men and women to\r\nbats and owls respectively (for bats and owls seem to be the\r\ncreatures usually allotted to the two sexes) is not based upon\r\npurely selfish considerations. For each man believes that not only\r\nhis own life but the lives of his father, brothers, sons, and so on\r\nare bound up with the lives of particular bats, and that therefore\r\nin protecting the bat species he is protecting the lives of all his\r\nmale relations as well as his own. Similarly, each woman believes\r\nthat the lives of her mother, sisters, daughters, and so forth,\r\nequally with her own, are bound up with the lives of particular\r\nowls, and that in guarding the owl species she is guarding the lives\r\nof all her female relations besides her own. Now, when men\'s lives\r\nare thus supposed to be contained in certain animals, it is obvious\r\nthat the animals can hardly be distinguished from the men, or the\r\nmen from the animals. If my brother John\'s life is in a bat, then,\r\non the one hand, the bat is my brother as well as John; and, on the\r\nother hand, John is in a sense a bat, since his life is in a bat.\r\nSimilarly, if my sister Mary\'s life is in an owl, then the owl is my\r\nsister and Mary is an owl. This is a natural enough conclusion, and\r\nthe Australians have not failed to draw it. When the bat is the\r\nman\'s animal, it is called his brother; and when the owl is the\r\nwoman\'s animal, it is called her sister. And conversely a man\r\naddresses a woman as an owl, and she addresses him as a bat. So with\r\nthe other animals allotted to the sexes respectively in other\r\ntribes. For example, among the Kurnai all emu-wrens were "brothers"\r\nof the men, and all the men were emu-wrens; all superb warblers were\r\n"sisters" of the women, and all the women were superb warblers.\r\n\r\nBut when a savage names himself after an animal, calls it his\r\nbrother, and refuses to kill it, the animal is said to be his totem.\r\nAccordingly in the tribes of South-Eastern Australia which we have\r\nbeen considering the bat and the owl, the emu-wren and the superb\r\nwarbler, may properly be described as totems of the sexes. But the\r\nassignation of a totem to a sex is comparatively rare, and has\r\nhitherto been discovered nowhere but in Australia. Far more commonly\r\nthe totem is appropriated not to a sex, but to a clan, and is\r\nhereditary either in the male or female line. The relation of an\r\nindividual to the clan totem does not differ in kind from his\r\nrelation to the sex totem; he will not kill it, he speaks of it as\r\nhis brother, and he calls himself by its name. Now if the relations\r\nare similar, the explanation which holds good of the one ought\r\nequally to hold good of the other. Therefore, the reason why a clan\r\nrevere a particular species of animals or plants (for the clan totem\r\nmay be a plant) and call themselves after it, would seem to be a\r\nbelief that the life of each individual of the clan is bound up with\r\nsome one animal or plant of the species, and that his or her death\r\nwould be the consequence of killing that particular animal, or\r\ndestroying that particular plant. This explanation of totemism\r\nsquares very well with Sir George Grey\'s definition of a totem or\r\n_kobong_ in Western Australia. He says: "A certain mysterious\r\nconnexion exists between a family and its _kobong,_ so that a member\r\nof the family will never kill an animal of the species to which his\r\n_kobong_ belongs, should he find it asleep; indeed he always kills\r\nit reluctantly, and never without affording it a chance to escape.\r\nThis arises from the family belief that some one individual of the\r\nspecies is their nearest friend, to kill whom would be a great\r\ncrime, and to be carefully avoided. Similarly, a native who has a\r\nvegetable for his _kobong_ may not gather it under certain\r\ncircumstances, and at a particular period of the year." Here it will\r\nbe observed that though each man spares all the animals or plants of\r\nthe species, they are not all equally precious to him; far from it,\r\nout of the whole species there is only one which is specially dear\r\nto him; but as he does not know which the dear one is, he is obliged\r\nto spare them all from fear of injuring the one. Again, this\r\nexplanation of the clan totem harmonises with the supposed effect of\r\nkilling one of the totem species. "One day one of the blacks killed\r\na crow. Three or four days afterwards a Boortwa (crow) [_i.e._ a man\r\nof the Crow clan] named Larry died. He had been ailing for some\r\ndays, but the killing of his _wingong_ [totem] hastened his death."\r\nHere the killing of the crow caused the death of a man of the Crow\r\nclan, exactly as, in the case of the sex-totems, the killing of a\r\nbat causes the death of a Bat-man or the killing of an owl causes\r\nthe death of an Owl-woman. Similarly, the killing of his _nagual_\r\ncauses the death of a Central American Indian, the killing of his\r\nbush soul causes the death of a Calabar negro, the killing of his\r\n_tamaniu_ causes the death of a Banks Islander, and the killing of\r\nthe animal in which his life is stowed away causes the death of the\r\ngiant or warlock in the fairy tale.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that the story of "The giant who had no heart in his\r\nbody" may perhaps furnish the key to the relation which is supposed\r\nto subsist between a man and his totem. The totem, on this theory,\r\nis simply the receptacle in which a man keeps his life, as Punchkin\r\nkept his life in a parrot, and Bidasari kept her soul in a golden\r\nfish. It is no valid objection to this view that when a savage has\r\nboth a sex totem and a clan totem his life must be bound up with two\r\ndifferent animals, the death of either of which would entail his\r\nown. If a man has more vital places than one in his body, why, the\r\nsavage may think, should he not have more vital places than one\r\noutside it? Why, since he can put his life outside himself, should\r\nhe not transfer one portion of it to one animal and another to\r\nanother? The divisibility of life, or, to put it otherwise, the\r\nplurality of souls, is an idea suggested by many familiar facts, and\r\nhas commended itself to philosophers like Plato, as well as to\r\nsavages. It is only when the notion of a soul, from being a\r\nquasi-scientific hypothesis, becomes a theological dogma that its\r\nunity and indivisibility are insisted upon as essential. The savage,\r\nunshackled by dogma, is free to explain the facts of life by the\r\nassumption of as many souls as he thinks necessary. Hence, for\r\nexample, the Caribs supposed that there was one soul in the head,\r\nanother in the heart, and other souls at all the places where an\r\nartery is felt pulsating. Some of the Hidatsa Indians explain the\r\nphenomena of gradual death, when the extremities appear dead first,\r\nby supposing that man has four souls, and that they quit the body,\r\nnot simultaneously, but one after the other, dissolution being only\r\ncomplete when all four have departed. Some of the Dyaks of Borneo\r\nand the Malays of the Peninsula believe that every man has seven\r\nsouls. The Alfoors of Poso in Celebes are of opinion that he has\r\nthree. The natives of Laos suppose that the body is the seat of\r\nthirty spirits, which reside in the hands, the feet, the mouth, the\r\neyes, and so on. Hence, from the primitive point of view, it is\r\nperfectly possible that a savage should have one soul in his sex\r\ntotem and another in his clan totem. However, as I have observed,\r\nsex totems have been found nowhere but in Australia; so that as a\r\nrule the savage who practises totemism need not have more than one\r\nsoul out of his body at a time.\r\n\r\nIf this explanation of the totem as a receptacle in which a man\r\nkeeps his soul or one of his souls is correct, we should expect to\r\nfind some totemic people of whom it is expressly said that every man\r\namongst them is believed to keep at least one soul permanently out\r\nof his body, and that the destruction of this external soul is\r\nsupposed to entail the death of its owner. Such a people are the\r\nBataks of Sumatra. The Bataks are divided into exogamous clans\r\n(_margas_) with descent in the male line; and each clan is forbidden\r\nto eat the flesh of a particular animal. One clan may not eat the\r\ntiger, another the ape, another the crocodile, another the dog,\r\nanother the cat, another the dove, another the white buffalo, and\r\nanother the locust. The reason given by members of a clan for\r\nabstaining from the flesh of the particular animal is either that\r\nthey are descended from animals of that species, and that their\r\nsouls after death may transmigrate into the animals, or that they or\r\ntheir forefathers have been under certain obligations to the\r\ncreatures. Sometimes, but not always, the clan bears the name of the\r\nanimal. Thus the Bataks have totemism in full. But, further, each\r\nBatak believes that he has seven or, on a more moderate computation,\r\nthree souls. One of these souls is always outside the body, but\r\nnevertheless whenever it dies, however far away it may be at the\r\ntime, that same moment the man dies also. The writer who mentions\r\nthis belief says nothing about the Batak totems; but on the analogy\r\nof the Australian, Central American, and African evidence we may\r\nconjecture that the external soul, whose death entails the death of\r\nthe man, is housed in the totemic animal or plant.\r\n\r\nAgainst this view it can hardly be thought to militate that the\r\nBatak does not in set terms affirm his external soul to be in his\r\ntotem, but alleges other grounds for respecting the sacred animal or\r\nplant of his clan. For if a savage seriously believes that his life\r\nis bound up with an external object, it is in the last degree\r\nunlikely that he will let any stranger into the secret. In all that\r\ntouches his inmost life and beliefs the savage is exceedingly\r\nsuspicious and reserved; Europeans have resided among savages for\r\nyears without discovering some of their capital articles of faith,\r\nand in the end the discovery has often been the result of accident.\r\nAbove all, the savage lives in an intense and perpetual dread of\r\nassassination by sorcery; the most trifling relics of his\r\nperson--the clippings of his hair and nails, his spittle, the\r\nremnants of his food, his very name--all these may, he fancies, be\r\nturned by the sorcerer to his destruction, and he is therefore\r\nanxiously careful to conceal or destroy them. But if in matters such\r\nas these, which are but the outposts and outworks of his life, he is\r\nso shy and secretive, how close must be the concealment, how\r\nimpenetrable the reserve in which he enshrouds the inner keep and\r\ncitadel of his being! When the princess in the fairy tale asks the\r\ngiant where he keeps his soul, he often gives false or evasive\r\nanswers, and it is only after much coaxing and wheedling that the\r\nsecret is at last wrung from him. In his jealous reticence the giant\r\nresembles the timid and furtive savage; but whereas the exigencies\r\nof the story demand that the giant should at last reveal his secret,\r\nno such obligation is laid on the savage; and no inducement that can\r\nbe offered is likely to tempt him to imperil his soul by revealing\r\nits hiding-place to a stranger. It is therefore no matter for\r\nsurprise that the central mystery of the savage\'s life should so\r\nlong have remained a secret, and that we should be left to piece it\r\ntogether from scattered hints and fragments and from the\r\nrecollections of it which linger in fairy tales.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The Ritual of Death and Resurrection\r\n\r\nTHIS view of totemism throws light on a class of religious rites of\r\nwhich no adequate explanation, so far as I am aware, has yet been\r\noffered. Amongst many savage tribes, especially such as are known to\r\npractice totemism, it is customary for lads at puberty to undergo\r\ncertain initiatory rites, of which one of the commonest is a\r\npretence of killing the lad and bringing him to life again. Such\r\nrites become intelligible if we suppose that their substance\r\nconsists in extracting the youth\'s soul in order to transfer it to\r\nhis totem. For the extraction of his soul would naturally be\r\nsupposed to kill the youth or at least to throw him into a\r\ndeath-like trance, which the savage hardly distinguishes from death.\r\nHis recovery would then be attributed either to the gradual recovery\r\nof his system from the violent shock which it had received, or, more\r\nprobably, to the infusion into him of fresh life drawn from the\r\ntotem. Thus the essence of these initiatory rites, so far as they\r\nconsist in a simulation of death and resurrection, would be an\r\nexchange of life or souls between the man and his totem. The\r\nprimitive belief in the possibility of such an exchange of souls\r\ncomes clearly out in a story of a Basque hunter who affirmed that he\r\nhad been killed by a bear, but that the bear had, after killing him,\r\nbreathed its own soul into him, so that the bear\'s body was now\r\ndead, but he himself was a bear, being animated by the bear\'s soul.\r\nThis revival of the dead hunter as a bear is exactly analogous to\r\nwhat, on the theory here suggested, is supposed to take place in the\r\nceremony of killing a lad at puberty and bringing him to life again.\r\nThe lad dies as a man and comes to life again as an animal; the\r\nanimal\'s soul is now in him, and his human soul is in the animal.\r\nWith good right, therefore, does he call himself a Bear or a Wolf,\r\netc., according to his totem; and with good right does he treat the\r\nbears or the wolves, etc., as his brethren, since in these animals\r\nare lodged the souls of himself and his kindred.\r\n\r\nExamples of this supposed death and resurrection at initiation are\r\nas follows. In the Wonghi or Wonghibon tribe of New South Wales the\r\nyouths on approaching manhood are initiated at a secret ceremony,\r\nwhich none but initiated men may witness. Part of the proceedings\r\nconsists in knocking out a tooth and giving a new name to the\r\nnovice, indicative of the change from youth to manhood. While the\r\nteeth are being knocked out an instrument known as a bull-roarer,\r\nwhich consists of a flat piece of wood with serrated edges tied to\r\nthe end of a string, is swung round so as to produce a loud humming\r\nnoise. The uninitiated are not allowed to see this instrument. Women\r\nare forbidden to witness the ceremonies under pain of death. It is\r\ngiven out that the youths are each met in turn by a mythical being,\r\ncalled Thuremlin (more commonly known as Daramulun) who takes the\r\nyouth to a distance, kills him, and in some instances cuts him up,\r\nafter which he restores him to life and knocks out a tooth. Their\r\nbelief in the power of Thuremlin is said to be undoubted.\r\n\r\nThe Ualaroi of the Upper Darling River said that at initiation the\r\nboy met a ghost, who killed him and brought him to life again as a\r\nyoung man. Among the natives on the Lower Lachlan and Murray Rivers\r\nit was Thrumalun (Daramulun) who was thought to slay and resuscitate\r\nthe novices. In the Unmatjera tribe of Central Australia women and\r\nchildren believe that a spirit called Twanyirika kills the youth and\r\nafterwards brings him to life again during the period of initiation.\r\nThe rites of initiation in this tribe, as in the other Central\r\ntribes, comprise the operations of circumcision and subincision; and\r\nas soon as the second of these has been performed on him, the young\r\nman receives from his father a sacred stick (_churinga_), with\r\nwhich, he is told, his spirit was associated in the remotest past.\r\nWhile he is out in the bush recovering from his wounds, he must\r\nswing the bull-roarer, or a being who lives up in the sky will swoop\r\ndown and carry him off. In the Binbinga tribe, on the western coast\r\nof the Gulf of Carpentaria, the women and children believe that the\r\nnoise of the bull-roarer at initiation is made by a spirit named\r\nKatajalina, who lives in an ant-hill and comes out and eats up the\r\nboy, afterwards restoring him to life. Similarly among their\r\nneighbours the Anula the women imagine that the droning sound of the\r\nbull-roarer is produced by a spirit called Gnabaia, who swallows the\r\nlads at initiation and afterwards disgorges them in the form of\r\ninitiated men.\r\n\r\nAmong the tribes settled on the southern coast of New South Wales,\r\nof which the Coast Murring tribe may be regarded as typical, the\r\ndrama of resurrection from the dead was exhibited in a graphic form\r\nto the novices at initiation. The ceremony has been described for us\r\nby an eye-witness. A man, disguised with stringy bark fibre, lay\r\ndown in a grave and was lightly covered up with sticks and earth. In\r\nhis hand he held a small bush, which appeared to be growing in the\r\nsoil, and other bushes were stuck in the ground to heighten the\r\neffect. Then the novices were brought and placed beside the grave.\r\nNext, a procession of men, disguised in stringy bark fibre, drew\r\nnear. They represented a party of medicine-men, guided by two\r\nreverend seniors, who had come on pilgrimage to the grave of a\r\nbrother medicine-man, who lay buried there. When the little\r\nprocession, chanting an invocation to Daramulun, had defiled from\r\namong the rocks and trees into the open, it drew up on the side of\r\nthe grave opposite to the novices, the two old men taking up a\r\nposition in the rear of the dancers. For some time the dance and\r\nsong went on till the tree that seemed to grow from the grave began\r\nto quiver. "Look there!" cried the men to the novices, pointing to\r\nthe trembling leaves. As they looked, the tree quivered more and\r\nmore, then was violently agitated and fell to the ground, while amid\r\nthe excited dancing of the dancers and the chanting of the choir the\r\nsupposed dead man spurned from him the superincumbent mass of sticks\r\nand leaves, and springing to his feet danced his magic dance in the\r\ngrave itself, and exhibited in his mouth the magic substances which\r\nhe was supposed to have received from Daramulun in person.\r\n\r\nSome tribes of Northern New Guinea--the Yabim, Bukaua, Kai, and\r\nTami--like many Australian tribes, require every male member of the\r\ntribe to be circumcised before he ranks as a full-grown man; and the\r\ntribal initiation, of which circumcision is the central feature, is\r\nconceived by them, as by some Australian tribes, as a process of\r\nbeing swallowed and disgorged by a mythical monster, whose voice is\r\nheard in the humming sound of the bull-roarer. Indeed the New Guinea\r\ntribes not only impress this belief on the minds of women and\r\nchildren, but enact it in a dramatic form at the actual rites of\r\ninitiation, at which no woman or uninitiated person may be present.\r\nFor this purpose a hut about a hundred feet long is erected either\r\nin the village or in a lonely part of the forest. It is modelled in\r\nthe shape of the mythical monster; at the end which represents his\r\nhead it is high, and it tapers away at the other end. A betel-palm,\r\ngrubbed up with the roots, stands for the backbone of the great\r\nbeing and its clustering fibres for his hair; and to complete the\r\nresemblance the butt end of the building is adorned by a native\r\nartist with a pair of goggle eyes and a gaping mouth. When after a\r\ntearful parting from their mothers and women folk, who believe or\r\npretend to believe in the monster that swallows their dear ones, the\r\nawe-struck novices are brought face to face with this imposing\r\nstructure, the huge creature emits a sullen growl, which is in fact\r\nno other than the humming note of bull-roarers swung by men\r\nconcealed in the monster\'s belly. The actual process of deglutition\r\nis variously enacted. Among the Tami it is represented by causing\r\nthe candidates to defile past a row of men who hold bull-roarers\r\nover their heads; among the Kai it is more graphically set forth by\r\nmaking them pass under a scaffold on which stands a man, who makes a\r\ngesture of swallowing and takes in fact a gulp of water as each\r\ntrembling novice passes beneath him. But the present of a pig,\r\nopportunely offered for the redemption of the youth, induces the\r\nmonster to relent and disgorge his victim; the man who represents\r\nthe monster accepts the gift vicariously, a gurgling sound is heard,\r\nand the water which had just been swallowed descends in a jet on the\r\nnovice. This signifies that the young man has been released from the\r\nmonster\'s belly. However, he has now to undergo the more painful and\r\ndangerous operation of circumcision. It follows immediately, and the\r\ncut made by the knife of the operator is explained to be a bite or\r\nscratch which the monster inflicted on the novice in spewing him out\r\nof his capacious maw. While the operation is proceeding, a\r\nprodigious noise is made by the swinging of bull-roarers to\r\nrepresent the roar of the dreadful being who is in the act of\r\nswallowing the young man.\r\n\r\nWhen, as sometimes happens, a lad dies from the effect of the\r\noperation, he is buried secretly in the forest, and his sorrowing\r\nmother is told that the monster has a pig\'s stomach as well as a\r\nhuman stomach, and that unfortunately her son slipped into the wrong\r\nstomach, from which it was impossible to extricate him. After they\r\nhave been circumcised the lads must remain for some months in\r\nseclusion, shunning all contact with women and even the sight of\r\nthem. They live in the long hut which represents the monster\'s\r\nbelly. When at last the lads, now ranking as initiated men, are\r\nbrought back with great pomp and ceremony to the village, they are\r\nreceived with sobs and tears of joy by the women, as if the grave\r\nhad given up its dead. At first the young men keep their eyes\r\nrigidly closed or even sealed with a plaster of chalk, and they\r\nappear not to understand the words of command which are given them\r\nby an elder. Gradually, however, they come to themselves as if\r\nawakening from a stupor, and next day they bathe and wash off the\r\ncrust of white chalk with which their bodies had been coated.\r\n\r\nIt is highly significant that all these tribes of New Guinea apply\r\nthe same word to the bull-roarer and to the monster, who is supposed\r\nto swallow the novices at circumcision, and whose fearful roar is\r\nrepresented by the hum of the harmless wooden instruments. Further,\r\nit deserves to be noted that in three languages out of the four the\r\nsame word which is applied to the bull-roarer and to the monster\r\nmeans also a ghost or spirit of the dead, while in the fourth\r\nlanguage (the Kai) it signifies "grandfather." From this it seems to\r\nfollow that the being who swallows and disgorges the novices at\r\ninitiation is believed to be a powerful ghost or ancestral spirit,\r\nand that the bull-roarer, which bears his name, is his material\r\nrepresentative. That would explain the jealous secrecy with which\r\nthe sacred implement is kept from the sight of women. While they are\r\nnot in use, the bull-roarers are stowed away in the men\'s\r\nclub-houses, which no woman may enter; indeed no woman or\r\nuninitiated person may set eyes on a bull-roarer under pain of\r\ndeath. Similarly among the Tugeri or Kaya-Kaya, a large Papuan tribe\r\non the south coast of Dutch New Guinea, the name of the bull-roarer,\r\nwhich they call _sosom,_ is given to a mythical giant, who is\r\nsupposed to appear every year with the south-east monsoon. When he\r\ncomes, a festival is held in his honour and bull-roarers are swung.\r\nBoys are presented to the giant, and he kills them, but\r\nconsiderately brings them to life again.\r\n\r\nIn certain districts of Viti Levu, the largest of the Fijian\r\nIslands, the drama of death and resurrection used to be acted with\r\nmuch solemnity before the eyes of young men at initiation. In a\r\nsacred enclosure they were shown a row of dead or seemingly dead men\r\nlying on the ground, their bodies cut open and covered with blood,\r\ntheir entrails protruding. But at a yell from the high priest the\r\ncounterfeit dead men started to their feet and ran down to the river\r\nto cleanse themselves from the blood and guts of pigs with which\r\nthey were beslobbered. Soon they marched back to the sacred\r\nenclosure as if come to life, clean, fresh, and garlanded, swaying\r\ntheir bodies in time to the music of a solemn hymn, and took their\r\nplaces in front of the novices. Such was the drama of death and\r\nresurrection.\r\n\r\nThe people of Rook, an island between New Guinea and New Britain,\r\nhold festivals at which one or two disguised men, their heads\r\ncovered with wooden masks, go dancing through the village, followed\r\nby all the other men. They demand that the circumcised boys who have\r\nnot yet been swallowed by Marsaba (the devil) shall be given up to\r\nthem. The boys, trembling and shrieking, are delivered to them, and\r\nmust creep between the legs of the disguised men. Then the\r\nprocession moves through the village again, and announces that\r\nMarsaba has eaten up the boys, and will not disgorge them till he\r\nreceives a present of pigs, taro, and so forth. So all the\r\nvillagers, according to their means, contribute provisions, which\r\nare then consumed in the name of Marsaba.\r\n\r\nIn the west of Ceram boys at puberty are admitted to the Kakian\r\nassociation. Modern writers have commonly regarded this association\r\nas primarily a political league instituted to resist foreign\r\ndomination. In reality its objects are purely religious and social,\r\nthough it is possible that the priests may have occasionally used\r\ntheir powerful influence for political ends. The society is in fact\r\nmerely one of those widely-diffused primitive institutions, of which\r\na chief object is the initiation of young men. In recent years the\r\ntrue nature of the association has been duly recognised by the\r\ndistinguished Dutch ethnologist, J. G. F. Riedel. The Kakian house\r\nis an oblong wooden shed, situated under the darkest trees in the\r\ndepth of the forest, and is built to admit so little light that it\r\nis impossible to see what goes on in it. Every village has such a\r\nhouse. Thither the boys who are to be initiated are conducted\r\nblindfold, followed by their parents and relations. Each boy is led\r\nby the hand of two men, who act as his sponsors or guardians,\r\nlooking after him during the period of initiation. When all are\r\nassembled before the shed, the high priest calls aloud upon the\r\ndevils. Immediately a hideous uproar is heard to proceed from the\r\nshed. It is made by men with bamboo trumpets, who have been secretly\r\nintroduced into the building by a back door, but the women and\r\nchildren think it is made by the devils, and are much terrified.\r\nThen the priests enter the shed, followed by the boys, one at a\r\ntime. As soon as each boy has disappeared within the precincts, a\r\ndull chopping sound is heard, a fearful cry rings out, and a sword\r\nor spear, dripping with blood, is thrust through the roof of the\r\nshed. This is a token that the boy\'s head has been cut off, and that\r\nthe devil has carried him away to the other world, there to\r\nregenerate and transform him. So at sight of the bloody sword the\r\nmothers weep and wail, crying that the devil has murdered their\r\nchildren. In some places, it would seem, the boys are pushed through\r\nan opening made in the shape of a crocodile\'s jaws or a cassowary\'s\r\nbeak, and it is then said that the devil has swallowed them. The\r\nboys remain in the shed for five or nine days. Sitting in the dark,\r\nthey hear the blast of the bamboo trumpets, and from time to time\r\nthe sound of musket shots and the clash of swords. Every day they\r\nbathe, and their faces and bodies are smeared with a yellow dye, to\r\ngive them the appearance of having been swallowed by the devil.\r\nDuring his stay in the Kakian house each boy has one or two crosses\r\ntattooed with thorns on his breast or arm. When they are not\r\nsleeping, the lads must sit in a crouching posture without moving a\r\nmuscle. As they sit in a row cross-legged, with their hands\r\nstretched out, the chief takes his trumpet, and placing the mouth of\r\nit on the hands of each lad, speaks through it in strange tones,\r\nimitating the voice of the spirits. He warns the lads, under pain of\r\ndeath, to observe the rules of the Kakian society, and never to\r\nreveal what has passed in the Kakian house. The novices are also\r\ntold by the priests to behave well to their blood relations, and are\r\ntaught the traditions and secrets of the tribe.\r\n\r\nMeantime the mothers and sisters of the lads have gone home to weep\r\nand mourn. But in a day or two the men who acted as guardians or\r\nsponsors to the novices return to the village with the glad tidings\r\nthat the devil, at the intercession of the priests, has restored the\r\nlads to life. The men who bring this news come in a fainting state\r\nand daubed with mud, like messengers freshly arrived from the nether\r\nworld. Before leaving the Kakian house, each lad receives from the\r\npriest a stick adorned at both ends with a cock\'s or cassowary\'s\r\nfeathers. The sticks are supposed to have been given to the lads by\r\nthe devil at the time when he restored them to life, and they serve\r\nas a token that the youths have been in the spirit land. When they\r\nreturn to their homes they totter in their walk, and enter the house\r\nbackward, as if they had forgotten how to walk properly; or they\r\nenter the house by the back door. If a plate of food is given to\r\nthem, they hold it upside down. They remain dumb, indicating their\r\nwants by signs only. All this is to show that they are still under\r\nthe influence of the devil or the spirits. Their sponsors have to\r\nteach them all the common acts of life, as if they were newborn\r\nchildren. Further, upon leaving the Kakian house the boys are\r\nstrictly forbidden to eat of certain fruits until the next\r\ncelebration of the rites has taken place. And for twenty or thirty\r\ndays their hair may not be combed by their mothers or sisters. At\r\nthe end of that time the high priest takes them to a lonely place in\r\nthe forest, and cuts off a lock of hair from the crown of each of\r\ntheir heads. After these initiatory rites the lads are deemed men,\r\nand may marry; it would be a scandal if they married before.\r\n\r\nIn the region of the Lower Congo a simulation of death and\r\nresurrection is, or rather used to be, practised by the members of a\r\nguild or secret society called _ndembo._ "In the practice of Ndembo\r\nthe initiating doctors get some one to fall down in a pretended fit,\r\nand in that state he is carried away to an enclosed place outside\r\nthe town. This is called \'dying Ndembo.\' Others follow suit,\r\ngenerally boys and girls, but often young men and women. . . . They\r\nare supposed to have died. But the parents and friends supply food,\r\nand after a period varying, according to custom, from three months\r\nto three years, it is arranged that the doctor shall bring them to\r\nlife again. . . . When the doctor\'s fee has been paid, and money\r\n(goods) saved for a feast, the _Ndembo_ people are brought to life.\r\nAt first they pretend to know no one and nothing; they do not even\r\nknow how to masticate food, and friends have to perform that office\r\nfor them. They want everything nice that any one uninitiated may\r\nhave, and beat them if it is not granted, or even strangle and kill\r\npeople. They do not get into trouble for this, because it is thought\r\nthat they do not know better. Sometimes they carry on the pretence\r\nof talking gibberish, and behaving as if they had returned from the\r\nspirit-world. After this they are known by another name, peculiar to\r\nthose who have \'died Ndembo.\' . . . We hear of the custom far along\r\non the upper river, as well as in the cataract region."\r\n\r\nAmong some of the Indian tribes of North America there exist certain\r\nreligious associations which are only open to candidates who have\r\ngone through a pretence of being killed and brought to life again.\r\nIn 1766 or 1767 Captain Jonathan Carver witnessed the admission of a\r\ncandidate to an association called "the friendly society of the\r\nSpirit" (_Wakon-Kitchewah_) among the Naudowessies, a Siouan or\r\nDacotan tribe in the region of the great lakes. The candidate knelt\r\nbefore the chief, who told him that "he himself was now agitated by\r\nthe same spirit which he should in a few moments communicate to him;\r\nthat it would strike him dead, but that he would instantly be\r\nrestored again to life; to this he added, that the communication,\r\nhowever terrifying, was a necessary introduction to the advantages\r\nenjoyed by the community into which he was on the point of being\r\nadmitted. As he spoke this, he appeared to be greatly agitated; till\r\nat last his emotions became so violent, that his countenance was\r\ndistorted, and his whole frame convulsed. At this juncture he threw\r\nsomething that appeared both in shape and colour like a small bean,\r\nat the young man, which seemed to enter his mouth, and he instantly\r\nfell as motionless as if he had been shot." For a time the man lay\r\nlike dead, but under a shower of blows he showed signs of\r\nconsciousness, and finally, discharging from his mouth the bean, or\r\nwhatever it was that the chief had thrown at him, he came to life.\r\nIn other tribes, for example, the Ojebways, Winnebagoes, and Dacotas\r\nor Sioux, the instrument by which the candidate is apparently slain\r\nis the medicine-bag. The bag is made of the skin of an animal (such\r\nas the otter, wild cat, serpent, bear, raccoon, wolf, owl, weasel),\r\nof which it roughly preserves the shape. Each member of the society\r\nhas one of these bags, in which he keeps the odds and ends that make\r\nup his "medicine" or charms. "They believe that from the\r\nmiscellaneous contents in the belly of the skin bag or animal there\r\nissues a spirit or breath, which has the power, not only to knock\r\ndown and kill a man, but also to set him up and restore him to\r\nlife." The mode of killing a man with one of these medicine-bags is\r\nto thrust it at him; he falls like dead, but a second thrust of the\r\nbag restores him to life.\r\n\r\nA ceremony witnessed by the castaway John R. Jewitt during his\r\ncaptivity among the Indians of Nootka Sound doubtless belongs to\r\nthis class of customs. The Indian king or chief "discharged a pistol\r\nclose to his son\'s ear, who immediately fell down as if killed, upon\r\nwhich all the women of the house set up a most lamentable cry,\r\ntearing handfuls of hair from their heads, and exclaiming that the\r\nprince was dead; at the same time a great number of the inhabitants\r\nrushed into the house armed with their daggers, muskets, etc.,\r\nenquiring the cause of their outcry. These were immediately followed\r\nby two others dressed in wolf-skins, with masks over their faces\r\nrepresenting the head of that animal. The latter came in on their\r\nhands and feet in the manner of a beast, and taking up the prince,\r\ncarried him off upon their backs, retiring in the same manner they\r\nentered." In another place Jewitt mentions that the young prince--a\r\nlad of about eleven years of age--wore a mask in imitation of a\r\nwolf\'s head. Now, as the Indians of this part of America are divided\r\ninto totem clans, of which the Wolf clan is one of the principal,\r\nand as the members of each clan are in the habit of wearing some\r\nportion of the totem animal about their person, it is probable that\r\nthe prince belonged to the Wolf clan, and that the ceremony\r\ndescribed by Jewitt represented the killing of the lad in order that\r\nhe might be born anew as a wolf, much in the same way that the\r\nBasque hunter supposed himself to have been killed and to have come\r\nto life again as a bear.\r\n\r\nThis conjectural explanation of the ceremony has, since it was first\r\nput forward, been to some extent confirmed by the researches of Dr.\r\nFranz Boas among these Indians; though it would seem that the\r\ncommunity to which the chief\'s son thus obtained admission was not\r\nso much a totem clan as a secret society called Tlokoala, whose\r\nmembers imitated wolves. Every new member of the society must be\r\ninitiated by the wolves. At night a pack of wolves, personated by\r\nIndians dressed in wolf-skins and wearing wolf-masks, make their\r\nappearance, seize the novice, and carry him into the woods. When the\r\nwolves are heard outside the village, coming to fetch away the\r\nnovice, all the members of the society blacken their faces and sing,\r\n"Among all the tribes is great excitement, because I am Tlokoala."\r\nNext day the wolves bring back the novice dead, and the members of\r\nthe society have to revive him. The wolves are supposed to have put\r\na magic stone into his body, which must be removed before he can\r\ncome to life. Till this is done the pretended corpse is left lying\r\noutside the house. Two wizards go and remove the stone, which\r\nappears to be quartz, and then the novice is resuscitated. Among the\r\nNiska Indians of British Columbia, who are divided into four\r\nprincipal clans with the raven, the wolf, the eagle, and the bear\r\nfor their respective totems, the novice at initiation is always\r\nbrought back by an artificial totem animal. Thus when a man was\r\nabout to be initiated into a secret society called Olala, his\r\nfriends drew their knives and pretended to kill him. In reality they\r\nlet him slip away, while they cut off the head of a dummy which had\r\nbeen adroitly substituted for him. Then they laid the decapitated\r\ndummy down and covered it over, and the women began to mourn and\r\nwail. His relations gave a funeral banquet and solemnly burnt the\r\neffigy. In short, they held a regular funeral. For a whole year the\r\nnovice remained absent and was seen by none but members of the\r\nsecret society. But at the end of that time he came back alive,\r\ncarried by an artificial animal which represented his totem.\r\n\r\nIn these ceremonies the essence of the rite appears to be the\r\nkilling of the novice in his character of a man and his restoration\r\nto life in the form of the animal which is thenceforward to be, if\r\nnot his guardian spirit, at least linked to him in a peculiarly\r\nintimate relation. It is to be remembered that the Indians of\r\nGuatemala, whose life was bound up with an animal, were supposed to\r\nhave the power of appearing in the shape of the particular creature\r\nwith which they were thus sympathetically united. Hence it seems not\r\nunreasonable to conjecture that in like manner the Indians of\r\nBritish Columbia may imagine that their life depends on the life of\r\nsome one of that species of creature to which they assimilate\r\nthemselves by their costume. At least if that is not an article of\r\nbelief with the Columbian Indians of the present day, it may very\r\nwell have been so with their ancestors in the past, and thus may\r\nhave helped to mould the rites and ceremonies both of the totem\r\nclans and of the secret societies. For though these two sorts of\r\ncommunities differ in respect of the mode in which membership of\r\nthem is obtained--a man being born into his totem clan but admitted\r\ninto a secret society later in life--we can hardly doubt that they\r\nare near akin and have their root in the same mode of thought. That\r\nthought, if I am right, is the possibility of establishing a\r\nsympathetic relation with an animal, a spirit, or other mighty\r\nbeing, with whom a man deposits for safe-keeping his soul or some\r\npart of it, and from whom he receives in return a gift of magical\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nThus, on the theory here suggested, wherever totemism is found, and\r\nwherever a pretence is made of killing and bringing to life again\r\nthe novice at initiation, there may exist or have existed not only a\r\nbelief in the possibility of permanently depositing the soul in some\r\nexternal object--animal, plant, or what not--but an actual intention\r\nof so doing. If the question is put, why do men desire to deposit\r\ntheir life outside their bodies? the answer can only be that, like\r\nthe giant in the fairy tale, they think it safer to do so than to\r\ncarry it about with them, just as people deposit their money with a\r\nbanker rather than carry it on their persons. We have seen that at\r\ncritical periods the life or soul is sometimes temporarily stowed\r\naway in a safe place till the danger is past. But institutions like\r\ntotemism are not resorted to merely on special occasions of danger;\r\nthey are systems into which every one, or at least every male, is\r\nobliged to be initiated at a certain period of life. Now the period\r\nof life at which initiation takes place is regularly puberty; and\r\nthis fact suggests that the special danger which totemism and\r\nsystems like it are intended to obviate is supposed not to arise\r\ntill sexual maturity has been attained, in fact, that the danger\r\napprehended is believed to attend the relation of the sexes to each\r\nother. It would be easy to prove by a long array of facts that the\r\nsexual relation is associated in the primitive mind with many\r\nserious perils; but the exact nature of the danger apprehended is\r\nstill obscure. We may hope that a more exact acquaintance with\r\nsavage modes of thought will in time disclose this central mystery\r\nof primitive society, and will thereby furnish the clue, not only to\r\ntotemism, but to the origin of the marriage system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVIII. The Golden Bough\r\n\r\nTHUS the view that Balder\'s life was in the mistletoe is entirely in\r\nharmony with primitive modes of thought. It may indeed sound like a\r\ncontradiction that, if his life was in the mistletoe, he should\r\nnevertheless have been killed by a blow from the plant. But when a\r\nperson\'s life is conceived as embodied in a particular object, with\r\nthe existence of which his own existence is inseparably bound up,\r\nand the destruction of which involves his own, the object in\r\nquestion may be regarded and spoken of indifferently as his life or\r\nhis death, as happens in the fairy tales. Hence if a man\'s death is\r\nin an object, it is perfectly natural that he should be killed by a\r\nblow from it. In the fairy tales Koshchei the Deathless is killed by\r\na blow from the egg or the stone in which his life or death is\r\nsecreted; the ogres burst when a certain grain of sand--doubtless\r\ncontaining their life or death--is carried over their heads; the\r\nmagician dies when the stone in which his life or death is contained\r\nis put under his pillow; and the Tartar hero is warned that he may\r\nbe killed by the golden arrow or golden sword in which his soul has\r\nbeen stowed away.\r\n\r\nThe idea that the life of the oak was in the mistletoe was probably\r\nsuggested, as I have said, by the observation that in winter the\r\nmistletoe growing on the oak remains green while the oak itself is\r\nleafless. But the position of the plant--growing not from the ground\r\nbut from the trunk or branches of the tree--might confirm this idea.\r\nPrimitive man might think that, like himself, the oak-spirit had\r\nsought to deposit his life in some safe place, and for this purpose\r\nhad pitched on the mistletoe, which, being in a sense neither on\r\nearth nor in heaven, might be supposed to be fairly out of harm\'s\r\nway. In a former chapter we saw that primitive man seeks to preserve\r\nthe life of his human divinities by keeping them poised between\r\nearth and heaven, as the place where they are least likely to be\r\nassailed by the dangers that encompass the life of man on earth. We\r\ncan therefore understand why it has been a rule both of ancient and\r\nof modern folk-medicine that the mistletoe should not be allowed to\r\ntouch the ground; were it to touch the ground, its healing virtue\r\nwould be gone. This may be a survival of the old superstition that\r\nthe plant in which the life of the sacred tree was concentrated\r\nshould not be exposed to the risk incurred by contact with the\r\nearth. In an Indian legend, which offers a parallel to the Balder\r\nmyth, Indra swore to the demon Namuci that he would slay him neither\r\nby day nor by night, neither with staff nor with bow, neither with\r\nthe palm of the hand nor with the fist, neither with the wet nor\r\nwith the dry. But he killed him in the morning twilight by\r\nsprinkling over him the foam of the sea. The foam of the sea is just\r\nsuch an object as a savage might choose to put his life in, because\r\nit occupies that sort of intermediate or nondescript position\r\nbetween earth and sky or sea and sky in which primitive man sees\r\nsafety. It is therefore not surprising that the foam of the river\r\nshould be the totem of a clan in India.\r\n\r\nAgain, the view that the mistletoe owes its mystic character partly\r\nto its not growing on the ground is confirmed by a parallel\r\nsuperstition about the mountain-ash or rowan-tree. In Jutland a\r\nrowan that is found growing out of the top of another tree is\r\nesteemed "exceedingly effective against witchcraft: since it does\r\nnot grow on the ground witches have no power over it; if it is to\r\nhave its full effect it must be cut on Ascension Day." Hence it is\r\nplaced over doors to prevent the ingress of witches. In Sweden and\r\nNorway, also, magical properties are ascribed to a "flying-rowan"\r\n(_fl\xf6gr\xf6nn_), that is to a rowan which is found growing not in the\r\nordinary fashion on the ground but on another tree, or on a roof, or\r\nin a cleft of the rock, where it has sprouted from seed scattered by\r\nbirds. They say that a man who is out in the dark should have a bit\r\nof "flying-rowan" with him to chew; else he runs a risk of being\r\nbewitched and of being unable to stir from the spot. Just as in\r\nScandinavia the parasitic rowan is deemed a countercharm to sorcery,\r\nso in Germany the parasitic mistletoe is still commonly considered a\r\nprotection against witch-craft, and in Sweden, as we saw, the\r\nmistletoe which is gathered on Midsummer Eve is attached to the\r\nceiling of the house, the horse\'s stall or the cow\'s crib, in the\r\nbelief that this renders the Troll powerless to injure man or beast.\r\n\r\nThe view that the mistletoe was not merely the instrument of\r\nBalder\'s death, but that it contained his life, is countenanced by\r\nthe analogy of a Scottish superstition. Tradition ran that the fate\r\nof the Hays of Errol, an estate in Perthshire, near the Firth of\r\nTay, was bound up with the mistletoe that grew on a certain great\r\noak. A member of the Hay family has recorded the old belief as\r\nfollows: "Among the low country families the badges are now almost\r\ngenerally forgotten; but it appears by an ancient MS., and the\r\ntradition of a few old people in Perthshire, that the badge of the\r\nHays was the mistletoe. There was formerly in the neighbourhood of\r\nErrol, and not far from the Falcon stone, a vast oak of an unknown\r\nage, and upon which grew a profusion of the plant: many charms and\r\nlegends were considered to be connected with the tree, and the\r\nduration of the family of Hay was said to be united with its\r\nexistence. It was believed that a sprig of the mistletoe cut by a\r\nHay on Allhallowmas eve, with a new dirk, and after surrounding the\r\ntree three times sunwise, and pronouncing a certain spell, was a\r\nsure charm against all glamour or witchery, and an infallible guard\r\nin the day of battle. A spray gathered in the same manner was placed\r\nin the cradle of infants, and thought to defend them from being\r\nchanged for elfbairns by the fairies. Finally, it was affirmed, that\r\nwhen the root of the oak had perished, \'the grass should grow in the\r\nhearth of Errol, and a raven should sit in the falcon\'s nest.\' The\r\ntwo most unlucky deeds which could be done by one of the name of Hay\r\nwas, to kill a white falcon, and to cut down a limb from the oak of\r\nErrol. When the old tree was destroyed I could never learn. The\r\nestate has been sold out of the family of Hay, and of course it is\r\nsaid that the fatal oak was cut down a short time before." The old\r\nsuperstition is recorded in verses which are traditionally ascribed\r\nto Thomas the Rhymer:\r\n\r\n\r\n    While the mistletoe bats on Errol\'s aik,\r\n    And that aik stands fast,\r\n    The Hays shall flourish, and their good grey hawk\r\n    Shall nocht flinch before the blast.\r\n\r\n    But when the root of the aik decays,\r\n    And the mistletoe dwines on its withered breast,\r\n    The grass shall grow on Errol\'s hearthstane,\r\n    And the corbie roup in the falcon\'s nest.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not a new opinion that the Golden Bough was the mistletoe.\r\nTrue, Virgil does not identify but only compares it with mistletoe.\r\nBut this may be only a poetical device to cast a mystic glamour over\r\nthe humble plant. Or, more probably, his description was based on a\r\npopular superstition that at certain times the mistletoe blazed out\r\ninto a supernatural golden glory. The poet tells how two doves,\r\nguiding Aeneas to the gloomy vale in whose depth grew the Golden\r\nBough, alighted upon a tree, "whence shone a flickering gleam of\r\ngold. As in the woods in winter cold the mistletoe--a plant not\r\nnative to its tree--is green with fresh leaves and twines its yellow\r\nberries about the boles; such seemed upon the shady holm-oak the\r\nleafy gold, so rustled in the gentle breeze the golden leaf." Here\r\nVirgil definitely describes the Golden Bough as growing on a\r\nholm-oak, and compares it with the mistletoe. The inference is\r\nalmost inevitable that the Golden Bough was nothing but the\r\nmistletoe seen through the haze of poetry or of popular\r\nsuperstition.\r\n\r\nNow grounds have been shown for believing that the priest of the\r\nArician grove--the King of the Wood--personified the tree on which\r\ngrew the Golden Bough. Hence if that tree was the oak, the King of\r\nthe Wood must have been a personification of the oakspirit. It is,\r\ntherefore, easy to understand why, before he could be slain, it was\r\nnecessary to break the Golden Bough. As an oak-spirit, his life or\r\ndeath was in the mistletoe on the oak, and so long as the mistletoe\r\nremained intact, he, like Balder, could not die. To slay him,\r\ntherefore, it was necessary to break the mistletoe, and probably, as\r\nin the case of Balder, to throw it at him. And to complete the\r\nparallel, it is only necessary to suppose that the King of the Wood\r\nwas formerly burned, dead or alive, at the midsummer fire festival\r\nwhich, as we have seen, was annually celebrated in the Arician\r\ngrove. The perpetual fire which burned in the grove, like the\r\nperpetual fire which burned in the temple of Vesta at Rome and under\r\nthe oak at Romove, was probably fed with the sacred oak-wood; and\r\nthus it would be in a great fire of oak that the King of the Wood\r\nformerly met his end. At a later time, as I have suggested, his\r\nannual tenure of office was lengthened or shortened, as the case\r\nmight be, by the rule which allowed him to live so long as he could\r\nprove his divine right by the strong hand. But he only escaped the\r\nfire to fall by the sword.\r\n\r\nThus it seems that at a remote age in the heart of Italy, beside the\r\nsweet Lake of Nemi, the same fiery tragedy was annually enacted\r\nwhich Italian merchants and soldiers were afterwards to witness\r\namong their rude kindred, the Celts of Gaul, and which, if the Roman\r\neagles had ever swooped on Norway, might have been found repeated\r\nwith little difference among the barbarous Aryans of the North. The\r\nrite was probably an essential feature in the ancient Aryan worship\r\nof the oak.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to ask, Why was the mistletoe called the Golden\r\nBough? The whitish-yellow of the mistletoe berries is hardly enough\r\nto account for the name, for Virgil says that the bough was\r\naltogether golden, stems as well as leaves. Perhaps the name may be\r\nderived from the rich golden yellow which a bough of mistletoe\r\nassumes when it has been cut and kept for some months; the bright\r\ntint is not confined to the leaves, but spreads to the stalks as\r\nwell, so that the whole branch appears to be indeed a Golden Bough.\r\nBreton peasants hang up great bunches of mistletoe in front of their\r\ncottages, and in the month of June these bunches are conspicuous for\r\nthe bright golden tinge of their foliage. In some parts of Brittany,\r\nespecially about Morbihan, branches of mistletoe are hung over the\r\ndoors of stables and byres to protect the horses and cattle,\r\nprobably against witchcraft.\r\n\r\nThe yellow colour of the withered bough may partly explain why the\r\nmistletoe has been sometimes supposed to possess the property of\r\ndisclosing treasures in the earth; for on the principles of\r\nhomoeopathic magic there is a natural affinity between a yellow\r\nbough and yellow gold. This suggestion is confirmed by the analogy\r\nof the marvellous properties popularly ascribed to the mythical\r\nfern-seed, which is popularly supposed to bloom like gold or fire on\r\nMidsummer Eve. Thus in Bohemia it is said that "on St. John\'s Day\r\nfern-seed blooms with golden blossoms that gleam like fire." Now it\r\nis a property of this mythical fern-seed that whoever has it, or\r\nwill ascend a mountain holding it in his hand on Midsummer Eve, will\r\ndiscover a vein of gold or will see the treasures of the earth\r\nshining with a bluish flame. In Russia they say that if you succeed\r\nin catching the wondrous bloom of the fern at midnight on Midsummer\r\nEve, you have only to throw it up into the air, and it will fall\r\nlike a star on the very spot where a treasure lies hidden. In\r\nBrittany treasure-seekers gather fern-seed at midnight on Midsummer\r\nEve, and keep it till Palm Sunday of the following year; then they\r\nstrew the seed on the ground where they think a treasure is\r\nconcealed. Tyrolese peasants imagine that hidden treasures can be\r\nseen glowing like flame on Midsummer Eve, and that fern-seed,\r\ngathered at this mystic season, with the usual precautions, will\r\nhelp to bring the buried gold to the surface. In the Swiss canton of\r\nFreiburg people used to watch beside a fern on St. John\'s night in\r\nthe hope of winning a treasure, which the devil himself sometimes\r\nbrought to them. In Bohemia they say that he who procures the golden\r\nbloom of the fern at this season has thereby the key to all hidden\r\ntreasures; and that if maidens will spread a cloth under the\r\nfast-fading bloom, red gold will drop into it. And in the Tryol and\r\nBohemia if you place fern-seed among money, the money will never\r\ndecrease, however much of it you spend. Sometimes the fern-seed is\r\nsupposed to bloom on Christmas night, and whoever catches it will\r\nbecome very rich. In Styria they say that by gathering fern-seed on\r\nChristmas night you can force the devil to bring you a bag of money.\r\n\r\nThus, on the principle of like by like, fern-seed is supposed to\r\ndiscover gold because it is itself golden; and for a similar reason\r\nit enriches its possessor with an unfailing supply of gold. But\r\nwhile the fern-seed is described as golden, it is equally described\r\nas glowing and fiery. Hence, when we consider that two great days\r\nfor gathering the fabulous seed are Midsummer Eve and\r\nChristmas--that is, the two solstices (for Christmas is nothing but\r\nan old heathen celebration of the winter solstice)--we are led to\r\nregard the fiery aspect of the fern-seed as primary, and its golden\r\naspect as secondary and derivative. Fern-seed, in fact, would seem\r\nto be an emanation of the sun\'s fire at the two turning-points of\r\nits course, the summer and winter solstices. This view is confirmed\r\nby a German story in which a hunter is said to have procured\r\nfern-seed by shooting at the sun on Midsummer Day at noon; three\r\ndrops of blood fell down, which he caught in a white cloth, and\r\nthese blood-drops were the fern-seed. Here the blood is clearly the\r\nblood of the sun, from which the fern-seed is thus directly derived.\r\nThus it may be taken as probable that fern-seed is golden, because\r\nit is believed to be an emanation of the sun\'s golden fire.\r\n\r\nNow, like fern-seed, the mistletoe is gathered either at Midsummer\r\nor at Christmas--that is, either at the summer or at the winter\r\nsolstice--and, like fern-seed, it is supposed to possess the power\r\nof revealing treasures in the earth. On Midsummer Eve people in\r\nSweden make divining-rods of mistletoe, or of four different kinds\r\nof wood one of which must be mistletoe. The treasure-seeker places\r\nthe rod on the ground after sundown, and when it rests directly over\r\ntreasure, the rod begins to move as if it were alive. Now, if the\r\nmistletoe discovers gold, it must be in its character of the Golden\r\nBough; and if it is gathered at the solstices, must not the Golden\r\nBough, like the golden fern-seed, be an emanation of the sun\'s fire?\r\nThe question cannot be answered with a simple affirmative. We have\r\nseen that the old Aryans perhaps kindled the solstitial and other\r\nceremonial fires in part as sun-charms, that is, with the intention\r\nof supplying the sun with fresh fire; and as these fires were\r\nusually made by the friction or combustion of oak-wood, it may have\r\nappeared to the ancient Aryan that the sun was periodically\r\nrecruited from the fire which resided in the sacred oak. In other\r\nwords, the oak may have seemed to him the original storehouse or\r\nreservoir of the fire which was from time to time drawn out to feed\r\nthe sun. But if the life of the oak was conceived to be in the\r\nmistletoe, the mistletoe must on that view have contained the seed\r\nor germ of the fire which was elicited by friction from the wood of\r\nthe oak. Thus, instead of saying that the mistletoe was an emanation\r\nof the sun\'s fire, it might be more correct to say that the sun\'s\r\nfire was regarded as an emanation of the mistletoe. No wonder, then,\r\nthat the mistletoe shone with a golden splendour, and was called the\r\nGolden Bough. Probably, however, like fern-seed, it was thought to\r\nassume its golden aspect only at those stated times, especially\r\nmidsummer, when fire was drawn from the oak to light up the sun. At\r\nPulverbatch, in Shropshire, it was believed within living memory\r\nthat the oak-tree blooms on Midsummer Eve and the blossom withers\r\nbefore daylight. A maiden who wishes to know her lot in marriage\r\nshould spread a white cloth under the tree at night, and in the\r\nmorning she will find a little dust, which is all that remains of\r\nthe flower. She should place the pinch of dust under her pillow, and\r\nthen her future husband will appear to her in her dreams. This\r\nfleeting bloom of the oak, if I am right, was probably the mistletoe\r\nin its character of the Golden Bough. The conjecture is confirmed by\r\nthe observation that in Wales a real sprig of mistletoe gathered on\r\nMidsummer Eve is similarly placed under the pillow to induce\r\nprophetic dreams; and further the mode of catching the imaginary\r\nbloom of the oak in a white cloth is exactly that which was employed\r\nby the Druids to catch the real mistletoe when it dropped from the\r\nbough of the oak, severed by the golden sickle. As Shropshire\r\nborders on Wales, the belief that the oak blooms on Midsummer Eve\r\nmay be Welsh in its immediate origin, though probably the belief is\r\na fragment of the primitive Aryan creed. In some parts of Italy, as\r\nwe saw, peasants still go out on Midsummer morning to search the\r\noak-trees for the "oil of St. John," which, like the mistletoe,\r\nheals all wounds, and is, perhaps, the mistletoe itself in its\r\nglorified aspect. Thus it is easy to understand how a title like the\r\nGolden Bough, so little descriptive of its usual appearance on the\r\ntree, should have been applied to the seemingly insignificant\r\nparasite. Further, we can perhaps see why in antiquity mistletoe was\r\nbelieved to possess the remarkable property of extinguishing fire,\r\nand why in Sweden it is still kept in houses as a safeguard against\r\nconflagration. Its fiery nature marks it out, on homoeopathic\r\nprinciples, as the best possible cure or preventive of injury by\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nThese considerations may partially explain why Virgil makes Aeneas\r\ncarry a glorified bough of mistletoe with him on his descent into\r\nthe gloomy subterranean world. The poet describes how at the very\r\ngates of hell there stretched a vast and gloomy wood, and how the\r\nhero, following the flight of two doves that lured him on, wandered\r\ninto the depths of the immemorial forest till he saw afar off\r\nthrough the shadows of the trees the flickering light of the Golden\r\nBough illuminating the matted boughs overhead. If the mistletoe, as\r\na yellow withered bough in the sad autumn woods, was conceived to\r\ncontain the seed of fire, what better companion could a forlorn\r\nwanderer in the nether shades take with him than a bough that would\r\nbe a lamp to his feet as well as a rod and staff to his hands? Armed\r\nwith it he might boldly confront the dreadful spectres that would\r\ncross his path on his adventurous journey. Hence when Aeneas,\r\nemerging from the forest, comes to the banks of Styx, winding slow\r\nwith sluggish stream through the infernal marsh, and the surly\r\nferryman refuses him passage in his boat, he has but to draw the\r\nGolden Bough from his bosom and hold it up, and straightway the\r\nblusterer quails at the sight and meekly receives the hero into his\r\ncrazy bark, which sinks deep in the water under the unusual weight\r\nof the living man. Even in recent times, as we have seen, mistletoe\r\nhas been deemed a protection against witches and trolls, and the\r\nancients may well have credited it with the same magical virtue. And\r\nif the parasite can, as some of our peasants believe, open all\r\nlocks, why should it not have served as an "open Sesame" in the\r\nhands of Aeneas to unlock the gates of death?\r\n\r\nNow, too, we can conjecture why Virbius at Nemi came to be\r\nconfounded with the sun. If Virbius was, as I have tried to show, a\r\ntree-spirit, he must have been the spirit of the oak on which grew\r\nthe Golden Bough; for tradition represented him as the first of the\r\nKings of the Wood. As an oak-spirit he must have been supposed\r\nperiodically to rekindle the sun\'s fire, and might therefore easily\r\nbe confounded with the sun itself. Similarly we can explain why\r\nBalder, an oak-spirit, was described as "so fair of face and so\r\nshining that a light went forth from him," and why he should have\r\nbeen so often taken to be the sun. And in general we may say that in\r\nprimitive society, when the only known way of making fire is by the\r\nfriction of wood, the savage must necessarily conceive of fire as a\r\nproperty stored away, like sap or juice, in trees, from which he has\r\nlaboriously to extract it. The Senal Indians of California "profess\r\nto believe that the whole world was once a globe of fire, whence\r\nthat element passed up into the trees, and now comes out whenever\r\ntwo pieces of wood are rubbed together." Similarly the Maidu Indians\r\nof California hold that "the earth was primarily a globe of molten\r\nmatter, and from that the principle of fire ascended through the\r\nroots into the trunk and branches of trees, whence the Indians can\r\nextract it by means of their drill." In Namoluk, one of the Caroline\r\nIslands, they say that the art of making fire was taught men by the\r\ngods. Olofaet, the cunning master of flames, gave fire to the bird\r\n_mwi_ and bade him carry it to earth in his bill. So the bird flew\r\nfrom tree to tree and stored away the slumbering force of the fire\r\nin the wood, from which men can elicit it by friction. In the\r\nancient Vedic hymns of India the fire-god Agni "is spoken of as born\r\nin wood, as the embryo of plants, or as distributed in plants. He is\r\nalso said to have entered into all plants or to strive after them.\r\nWhen he is called the embryo of trees or of trees as well as plants,\r\nthere may be a side-glance at the fire produced in forests by the\r\nfriction of the boughs of trees."\r\n\r\nA tree which has been struck by lightning is naturally regarded by\r\nthe savage as charged with a double or triple portion of fire; for\r\nhas he not seen the mighty flash enter into the trunk with his own\r\neyes? Hence perhaps we may explain some of the many superstitious\r\nbeliefs concerning trees that have been struck by lightning. When\r\nthe Thompson Indians of British Columbia wished to set fire to the\r\nhouses of their enemies, they shot at them arrows which were either\r\nmade from a tree that had been struck by lightning or had splinters\r\nof such wood attached to them. Wendish peasants of Saxony refuse to\r\nburn in their stoves the wood of trees that have been struck by\r\nlightning; they say that with such fuel the house would be burnt\r\ndown. In like manner the Thonga of South Africa will not use such\r\nwood as fuel nor warm themselves at a fire which has been kindled\r\nwith it. On the contrary, when lightning sets fire to a tree, the\r\nWinamwanga of Northern Rhodesia put out all the fires in the village\r\nand plaster the fireplaces afresh, while the head men convey the\r\nlightning-kindled fire to the chief, who prays over it. The chief\r\nthen sends out the new fire to all his villages, and the villagers\r\nreward his messengers for the boon. This shows that they look upon\r\nfire kindled by lightning with reverence, and the reverence is\r\nintelligible, for they speak of thunder and lightning as God himself\r\ncoming down to earth. Similarly the Maidu Indians of California\r\nbelieve that a Great Man created the world and all its inhabitants,\r\nand that lightning is nothing but the Great Man himself descending\r\nswiftly out of heaven and rending the trees with his flaming arms.\r\n\r\nIt is a plausible theory that the reverence which the ancient\r\npeoples of Europe paid to the oak, and the connexion which they\r\ntraced between the tree and their sky-god, were derived from the\r\nmuch greater frequency with which the oak appears to be struck by\r\nlightning than any other tree of our European forests. This\r\npeculiarity of the tree has seemingly been established by a series\r\nof observations instituted within recent years by scientific\r\nenquirers who have no mythological theory to maintain. However we\r\nmay explain it, whether by the easier passage of electricity through\r\noak-wood than through any other timber, or in some other way, the\r\nfact itself may well have attracted the notice of our rude\r\nforefathers, who dwelt in the vast forests which then covered a\r\nlarge part of Europe; and they might naturally account for it in\r\ntheir simple religious way by supposing that the great sky-god, whom\r\nthey worshipped and whose awful voice they heard in the roll of\r\nthunder, loved the oak above all the trees of the wood and often\r\ndescended into it from the murky cloud in a flash of lightning,\r\nleaving a token of his presence or of his passage in the riven and\r\nblackened trunk and the blasted foliage. Such trees would\r\nthenceforth be encircled by a nimbus of glory as the visible seats\r\nof the thundering sky-god. Certain it is that, like some savages,\r\nboth Greeks and Romans identified their great god of the sky and of\r\nthe oak with the lightning flash which struck the ground; and they\r\nregularly enclosed such a stricken spot and treated it thereafter as\r\nsacred. It is not rash to suppose that the ancestors of the Celts\r\nand Germans in the forests of Central Europe paid a like respect for\r\nlike reasons to a blasted oak.\r\n\r\nThis explanation of the Aryan reverence for the oak and of the\r\nassociation of the tree with the great god of the thunder and the\r\nsky, was suggested or implied long ago by Jacob Grimm, and has been\r\nin recent years powerfully reinforced by Mr. W. Warde Fowler. It\r\nappears to be simpler and more probable than the explanation which I\r\nformerly adopted, namely, that the oak was worshipped primarily for\r\nthe many benefits which our rude forefathers derived from the tree,\r\nparticularly for the fire which they drew by friction from its wood;\r\nand that the connexion of the oak with the sky was an after-thought\r\nbased on the belief that the flash of lightning was nothing but the\r\nspark which the sky-god up aloft elicited by rubbing two pieces of\r\noak-wood against each other, just as his savage worshipper kindled\r\nfire in the forest on earth. On that theory the god of the thunder\r\nand the sky was derived from the original god of the oak; on the\r\npresent theory, which I now prefer, the god of the sky and the\r\nthunder was the great original deity of our Aryan ancestors, and his\r\nassociation with the oak was merely an inference based on the\r\nfrequency with which the oak was seen to be struck by lightning. If\r\nthe Aryans, as some think, roamed the wide steppes of Russia or\r\nCentral Asia with their flocks and herds before they plunged into\r\nthe gloom of the European forests, they may have worshipped the god\r\nof the blue or cloudy firmament and the flashing thunderbolt long\r\nbefore they thought of associating him with the blasted oaks in\r\ntheir new home.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the new theory has the further advantage of throwing light\r\non the special sanctity ascribed to mistletoe which grows on an oak.\r\nThe mere rarity of such a growth on an oak hardly suffices to\r\nexplain the extent and the persistence of the superstition. A hint\r\nof its real origin is possibly furnished by the statement of Pliny\r\nthat the Druids worshipped the plant because they believed it to\r\nhave fallen from heaven and to be a token that the tree on which it\r\ngrew was chosen by the god himself. Can they have thought that the\r\nmistletoe dropped on the oak in a flash of lightning? The conjecture\r\nis confirmed by the name thunder-besom which is applied to mistletoe\r\nin the Swiss canton of Aargau, for the epithet clearly implies a\r\nclose connexion between the parasite and the thunder; indeed\r\n"thunder-besom" is a popular name in Germany for any bushy nest-like\r\nexcrescence growing on a branch, because such a parasitic growth is\r\nactually believed by the ignorant to be a product of lightning. If\r\nthere is any truth in this conjecture, the real reason why the\r\nDruids worshipped a mistletoe-bearing oak above all other trees of\r\nthe forest was a belief that every such oak had not only been struck\r\nby lightning but bore among its branches a visible emanation of the\r\ncelestial fire; so that in cutting the mistletoe with mystic rites\r\nthey were securing for themselves all the magical properties of a\r\nthunder-bolt. If that was so, we must apparently conclude that the\r\nmistletoe was deemed an emanation of the lightning rather than, as I\r\nhave thus far argued, of the midsummer sun. Perhaps, indeed, we\r\nmight combine the two seemingly divergent views by supposing that in\r\nthe old Aryan creed the mistletoe descended from the sun on\r\nMidsummer Day in a flash of lightning. But such a combination is\r\nartificial and unsupported, so far as I know, by any positive\r\nevidence. Whether on mythical principles the two interpretations can\r\nreally be reconciled with each other or not, I will not presume to\r\nsay; but even should they prove to be discrepant, the inconsistency\r\nneed not have prevented our rude forefathers from embracing both of\r\nthem at the same time with an equal fervour of conviction; for like\r\nthe great majority of mankind the savage is above being hidebound by\r\nthe trammels of a pedantic logic. In attempting to track his devious\r\nthought through the jungle of crass ignorance and blind fear, we\r\nmust always remember that we are treading enchanted ground, and must\r\nbeware of taking for solid realities the cloudy shapes that cross\r\nour path or hover and gibber at us through the gloom. We can never\r\ncompletely replace ourselves at the standpoint of primitive man, see\r\nthings with his eyes, and feel our hearts beat with the emotions\r\nthat stirred his. All our theories concerning him and his ways must\r\ntherefore fall far short of certainty; the utmost we can aspire to\r\nin such matters is a reasonable degree of probability.\r\n\r\nTo conclude these enquiries we may say that if Balder was indeed, as\r\nI have conjectured, a personification of a mistletoe-bearing oak,\r\nhis death by a blow of the mistletoe might on the new theory be\r\nexplained as a death by a stroke of lightning. So long as the\r\nmistletoe, in which the flame of the lightning smouldered, was\r\nsuffered to remain among the boughs, so long no harm could befall\r\nthe good and kindly god of the oak, who kept his life stowed away\r\nfor safety between earth and heaven in the mysterious parasite; but\r\nwhen once that seat of his life, or of his death, was torn from the\r\nbranch and hurled at the trunk, the tree fell--the god died--smitten\r\nby a thunderbolt.\r\n\r\nAnd what we have said of Balder in the oak forests of Scandinavia\r\nmay perhaps, with all due diffidence in a question so obscure and\r\nuncertain, be applied to the priest of Diana, the King of the Wood,\r\nat Aricia in the oak forests of Italy. He may have personated in\r\nflesh and blood the great Italian god of the sky, Jupiter, who had\r\nkindly come down from heaven in the lightning flash to dwell among\r\nmen in the mistletoe--the thunder-besom--the Golden Bough--growing\r\non the sacred oak in the dells of Nemi. If that was so, we need not\r\nwonder that the priest guarded with drawn sword the mystic bough\r\nwhich contained the god\'s life and his own. The goddess whom he\r\nserved and married was herself, if I am right, no other than the\r\nQueen of Heaven, the true wife of the sky-god. For she, too, loved\r\nthe solitude of the woods and the lonely hills, and sailing overhead\r\non clear nights in the likeness of the silver moon looked down with\r\npleasure on her own fair image reflected on the calm, the burnished\r\nsurface of the lake, Diana\'s Mirror.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIX. Farewell to Nemi\r\n\r\nWE are at the end of our enquiry, but as often happens in the search\r\nafter truth, if we have answered one question, we have raised many\r\nmore; if we have followed one track home, we have had to pass by\r\nothers that opened off it and led, or seemed to lead, to far other\r\ngoals than the sacred grove at Nemi. Some of these paths we have\r\nfollowed a little way; others, if fortune should be kind, the writer\r\nand the reader may one day pursue together. For the present we have\r\njourneyed far enough together, and it is time to part. Yet before we\r\ndo so, we may well ask ourselves whether there is not some more\r\ngeneral conclusion, some lesson, if possible, of hope and\r\nencouragement, to be drawn from the melancholy record of human error\r\nand folly which has engaged our attention in this book.\r\n\r\nIf then we consider, on the one hand, the essential similarity of\r\nman\'s chief wants everywhere and at all times, and on the other\r\nhand, the wide difference between the means he has adopted to\r\nsatisfy them in different ages, we shall perhaps be disposed to\r\nconclude that the movement of the higher thought, so far as we can\r\ntrace it, has on the whole been from magic through religion to\r\nscience. In magic man depends on his own strength to meet the\r\ndifficulties and dangers that beset him on every side. He believes\r\nin a certain established order of nature on which he can surely\r\ncount, and which he can manipulate for his own ends. When he\r\ndiscovers his mistake, when he recognises sadly that both the order\r\nof nature which he had assumed and the control which he had believed\r\nhimself to exercise over it were purely imaginary, he ceases to rely\r\non his own intelligence and his own unaided efforts, and throws\r\nhimself humbly on the mercy of certain great invisible beings behind\r\nthe veil of nature, to whom he now ascribes all those far-reaching\r\npowers which he once arrogated to himself. Thus in the acuter minds\r\nmagic is gradually superseded by religion, which explains the\r\nsuccession of natural phenomena as regulated by the will, the\r\npassion, or the caprice of spiritual beings like man in kind, though\r\nvastly superior to him in power.\r\n\r\nBut as time goes on this explanation in its turn proves to be\r\nunsatisfactory. For it assumes that the succession of natural events\r\nis not determined by immutable laws, but is to some extent variable\r\nand irregular, and this assumption is not borne out by closer\r\nobservation. On the contrary, the more we scrutinise that succession\r\nthe more we are struck by the rigid uniformity, the punctual\r\nprecision with which, wherever we can follow them, the operations of\r\nnature are carried on. Every great advance in knowledge has extended\r\nthe sphere of order and correspondingly restricted the sphere of\r\napparent disorder in the world, till now we are ready to anticipate\r\nthat even in regions where chance and confusion appear still to\r\nreign, a fuller knowledge would everywhere reduce the seeming chaos\r\nto cosmos. Thus the keener minds, still pressing forward to a deeper\r\nsolution of the mysteries of the universe, come to reject the\r\nreligious theory of nature as inadequate, and to revert in a measure\r\nto the older standpoint of magic by postulating explicitly, what in\r\nmagic had only been implicitly assumed, to wit, an inflexible\r\nregularity in the order of natural events, which, if carefully\r\nobserved, enables us to foresee their course with certainty and to\r\nact accordingly. In short, religion, regarded as an explanation of\r\nnature, is displaced by science.\r\n\r\nBut while science has this much in common with magic that both rest\r\non a faith in order as the underlying principle of all things,\r\nreaders of this work will hardly need to be reminded that the order\r\npresupposed by magic differs widely from that which forms the basis\r\nof science. The difference flows naturally from the different modes\r\nin which the two orders have been reached. For whereas the order on\r\nwhich magic reckons is merely an extension, by false analogy, of the\r\norder in which ideas present themselves to our minds, the order laid\r\ndown by science is derived from patient and exact observation of the\r\nphenomena themselves. The abundance, the solidity, and the splendour\r\nof the results already achieved by science are well fitted to\r\ninspire us with a cheerful confidence in the soundness of its\r\nmethod. Here at last, after groping about in the dark for countless\r\nages, man has hit upon a clue to the labyrinth, a golden key that\r\nopens many locks in the treasury of nature. It is probably not too\r\nmuch to say that the hope of progress--moral and intellectual as\r\nwell as material--in the future is bound up with the fortunes of\r\nscience, and that every obstacle placed in the way of scientific\r\ndiscovery is a wrong to humanity.\r\n\r\nYet the history of thought should warn us against concluding that\r\nbecause the scientific theory of the world is the best that has yet\r\nbeen formulated, it is necessarily complete and final. We must\r\nremember that at bottom the generalisations of science or, in common\r\nparlance, the laws of nature are merely hypotheses devised to\r\nexplain that ever-shifting phantasmagoria of thought which we\r\ndignify with the high-sounding names of the world and the universe.\r\nIn the last analysis magic, religion, and science are nothing but\r\ntheories of thought; and as science has supplanted its predecessors,\r\nso it may hereafter be itself superseded by some more perfect\r\nhypothesis, perhaps by some totally different way of looking at the\r\nphenomena--of registering the shadows on the screen--of which we in\r\nthis generation can form no idea. The advance of knowledge is an\r\ninfinite progression towards a goal that for ever recedes. We need\r\nnot murmur at the endless pursuit:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Fatti non foste a viver come bruti\r\n    Ma per seguir virtute e conoscenza.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat things will come of that pursuit, though we may not enjoy\r\nthem. Brighter stars will rise on some voyager of the future--some\r\ngreat Ulysses of the realms of thought--than shine on us. The dreams\r\nof magic may one day be the waking realities of science. But a dark\r\nshadow lies athwart the far end of this fair prospect. For however\r\nvast the increase of knowledge and of power which the future may\r\nhave in store for man, he can scarcely hope to stay the sweep of\r\nthose great forces which seem to be making silently but relentlessly\r\nfor the destruction of all this starry universe in which our earth\r\nswims as a speck or mote. In the ages to come man may be able to\r\npredict, perhaps even to control, the wayward courses of the winds\r\nand clouds, but hardly will his puny hands have strength to speed\r\nafresh our slackening planet in its orbit or rekindle the dying fire\r\nof the sun. Yet the philosopher who trembles at the idea of such\r\ndistant catastrophes may console himself by reflecting that these\r\ngloomy apprehensions, like the earth and the sun themselves, are\r\nonly parts of that unsubstantial world which thought has conjured up\r\nout of the void, and that the phantoms which the subtle enchantress\r\nhas evoked to-day she may ban to-morrow. They too, like so much that\r\nto common eyes seems solid, may melt into air, into thin air.\r\n\r\nWithout dipping so far into the future, we may illustrate the course\r\nwhich thought has hitherto run by likening it to a web woven of\r\nthree different threads--the black thread of magic, the red thread\r\nof religion, and the white thread of science, if under science we\r\nmay include those simple truths, drawn from observation of nature,\r\nof which men in all ages have possessed a store. Could we then\r\nsurvey the web of thought from the beginning, we should probably\r\nperceive it to be at first a chequer of black and white, a patchwork\r\nof true and false notions, hardly tinged as yet by the red thread of\r\nreligion. But carry your eye farther along the fabric and you will\r\nremark that, while the black and white chequer still runs through\r\nit, there rests on the middle portion of the web, where religion has\r\nentered most deeply into its texture, a dark crimson stain, which\r\nshades off insensibly into a lighter tint as the white thread of\r\nscience is woven more and more into the tissue. To a web thus\r\nchequered and stained, thus shot with threads of diverse hues, but\r\ngradually changing colour the farther it is unrolled, the state of\r\nmodern thought, with all its divergent aims and conflicting\r\ntendencies, may be compared. Will the great movement which for\r\ncenturies has been slowly altering the complexion of thought be\r\ncontinued in the near future? or will a reaction set in which may\r\narrest progress and even undo much that has been done? To keep up\r\nour parable, what will be the colour of the web which the Fates are\r\nnow weaving on the humming loom of time? will it be white or red? We\r\ncannot tell. A faint glimmering light illumines the backward portion\r\nof the web. Clouds and thick darkness hide the other end.\r\n\r\nOur long voyage of discovery is over and our bark has drooped her\r\nweary sails in port at last. Once more we take the road to Nemi. It\r\nis evening, and as we climb the long slope of the Appian Way up to\r\nthe Alban Hills, we look back and see the sky aflame with sunset,\r\nits golden glory resting like the aureole of a dying saint over Rome\r\nand touching with a crest of fire the dome of St. Peter\'s. The sight\r\nonce seen can never be forgotten, but we turn from it and pursue our\r\nway darkling along the mountain side, till we come to Nemi and look\r\ndown on the lake in its deep hollow, now fast disappearing in the\r\nevening shadows. The place has changed but little since Diana\r\nreceived the homage of her worshippers in the sacred grove. The\r\ntemple of the sylvan goddess, indeed, has vanished and the King of\r\nthe Wood no longer stands sentinel over the Golden Bough. But Nemi\'s\r\nwoods are still green, and as the sunset fades above them in the\r\nwest, there comes to us, borne on the swell of the wind, the sound\r\nof the church bells of Aricia ringing the Angelus. _Ave Maria!_\r\nSweet and solemn they chime out from the distant town and die\r\nlingeringly away across the wide Campagnan marshes. _Le roi est\r\nmort, vive le roi! Ave Maria!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s The Golden Bough, by Sir James George Frazer\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE GOLDEN BOUGH ***\r\n\r\nThis file should be named 3623-8.txt or 3623-8.zip\r\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, bough11.txt\r\nVERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, bough10a.txt\r\n\r\nThis etext was produced by David Reed\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.
