Ah, no! Cast your sympathy on the chill\r\nwaves of troubled waters; fling it on the oases of futurity; dash it\r\nagainst the rock of gossip; or, better still, allow it to remain within\r\nthe false and faithless bosom of buried scorn.\r\n\r\nSuch were a few remarks of Irene as she paced the beach of limited\r\nfreedom, alone and unprotected. Sympathy can wound the breast of trodden\r\npatience,--it hath no rival to insure the feelings we possess, save that\r\nof sorrow.\r\n\r\nThe gloomy mansion stands firmly within the ivy-covered, stoutly-built\r\nwalls of Dunfern, vast in proportion and magnificent in display. It has\r\nbeen built over three hundred years, and its structure stands\r\nrespectably distant from modern advancement, and in some degrees it\r\ncould boast of architectural designs rarely, if ever, attempted since\r\nits construction.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to this beautiful home of Sir Hugh Dunfern, the present\r\nowner, is planned on most antique principles; nothing save an enormous\r\niron gate meets the gaze of the visitor, who at first is inclined to\r\nthink that all public rumours relative to its magnificence are only the\r\nutterances of the boastful and idle; nor until within its winding paths\r\nof finest pebble, studded here and there with huge stones of unpolished\r\ngranite, could the mind for a moment conceive or entertain the faintest\r\nidea of its quaint grandeur.\r\n\r\nBeautiful, however, as Dunfern mansion may seem to the anxious eye of\r\nthe beholder, yet it is not altogether free from mystery. Whilst many of\r\nits rooms, with walls of crystal, are gorgeously and profusely\r\nfurnished, others are locked incessantly against the foot of the\r\ncautious intruder, having in them only a few traditional relics of no\r\nmaterial consequence whatever, or even interest, to any outside the\r\nancestral line of its occupants.\r\n\r\nIt has often been the chief subject of comment amongst the few\r\ndistinguished visitors welcomed within its spacious apartments, why\r\nseemingly the finest rooms the mansion owned were always shut against\r\ntheir eager and scrutinizing gaze; or why, when referred to by any of\r\nthem, the matter was always treated with silence.\r\n\r\nAll that can now be done is merely to allow the thought to dwindle into\r\nbleak oblivion, until aroused to that standard of disclosure which\r\ndefies hindrance.\r\n\r\nWithin the venerable walls surrounding this erection of amazement and\r\nwonder may be seen species of trees rarely, if ever, met with; yea,\r\nwithin the beaded borders of this grand old mansion the eye of the\r\nprivileged beholds the magnificent lake, studded on every side with\r\nstone of costliest cut and finish; the richest vineries, the most\r\nelegant ferns, the daintiest conservatories, the flowers and plants of\r\nalmost every clime in abundance, the most fashionable walks, the most\r\nintricate windings that imagination could possibly conceive or genius\r\ncontrive. In fact, it has well been named "The Eden of Luxury."\r\n\r\nDunfern mansion was handed down as an heirloom since its purchase by\r\nWalter, third Earl of Dunfern, in 1674; and since then has been tenderly\r\ncared for internally, and carefully guarded externally, by the skilful\r\nhands of noted artisans. The present owner is only son of Sir John\r\nDunfern, by Irene, adopted daughter of Lord and Lady Dilworth, of\r\nDilworth Castle, County Kent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe December sun had hidden its dull rays behind the huge rocks that\r\nrose monstrously high west of Dunfern mansion, and ceased to gladden the\r\nsuperb apartment Sir John occupied most part of the day. They had\r\nwithdrawn their faint reflection from within the mirrored walls of this\r\nsolitary chamber to brighten other homes with their never-dying sheen.\r\n\r\nAs the dull, grey evening advanced to such a degree as to render a look\r\nof brightness imperative to the surroundings of its sole occupant, Sir\r\nJohn requested that his favourite apartment should be made bright as\r\npossible by adding more fuel to the smouldering ashes within the\r\nglistening bars which guarded their remains. This being done, three huge\r\nlamps were lighted, and placed at respectable distances from each other,\r\nwhen Sir John, with his accustomed grace, began to peruse some of his\r\nevening papers.\r\n\r\nThough a man of forty summers, he never yet had entertained the thought\r\nof yielding up his bacheloric ideas to supplace them with others which\r\neventually should coincide with those of a different sex; in fact,\r\nhe never had bestowed a thought on changing his habits and manner of\r\nliving, nor until fully realising his position of birthright, that had\r\nbeen treasured by his ancestors for such a lengthened period, and which,\r\nsooner or later, must pass into strangers\' hands, did the thought ever\r\noccur to him of entering into the league of the blessed.\r\n\r\nThe clock had just chimed nine when a maid entered with a note, neatly\r\nlaid on a trim little tray, which she placed on the table close beside\r\nher master, and then retired. It was rather unusual for him to receive\r\nletters so late in the evening, nor until he was in full possession of\r\nits contents he could not form the faintest imagination of its worth.\r\n\r\nNot far from Dunfern Mansion may be seen situated on a rising hill the\r\nbeautiful Castle of Lord and Lady Dilworth, a\xa0prominent building\r\ncommanding the finest view in the county. It had been remodelled by the\r\npresent owner, after inheriting it from his late maternal uncle--Lord\r\nLeyburn; and, although equipped with all modern improvements and\r\ninventions necessary, yet there dwelt a lack of design and beauty about\r\nit possessed by Dunfern Mansion.\r\n\r\nThe bountiful owner of Dilworth Castle differed much in many respects\r\nfrom Sir John Dunfern. He was a nobleman of rare tact and capacities;\r\na\xa0keen sportsman; a\xa0Turf frequenter; an ardent politician; and, in fact,\r\na\xa0lover of everything which served to promote the interests of his\r\nextended and varied social circle in particular, and entire community in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nLady Dilworth, it may here be mentioned, was never of a very robust\r\nnature, and often had she felt the great strain of society press rather\r\nheavily on her weak frame, so much so, as to render the adoption of the\r\nsubject of this book indispensable. Drawing his chair closer to the\r\ntable, on which one of the great lamps stood, Sir John proceeded to\r\nperuse the contents of the note. It was an invitation from Lord and Lady\r\nDilworth to attend a ball at Dilworth Castle on 22nd prox., given by\r\nthem in honour of the marriage of Henry, fifth Marquis of Hill-Hall,\r\nwith Ethel, Countess of Maidstone.\r\n\r\nLord Dilworth and the Marquis were personal friends of Sir John, and to\r\naccept this kind and courteous invitation would mean a step towards the\r\nsummit of the matrimonial ladder, by meeting the majority of the\r\nfully-fledged belles in and around Canterbury, and especially Irene\r\nIddesleigh, Lord Dilworth\'s adopted daughter, more generally known as\r\n"The Southern Beauty." He slept over the matter that night, with the\r\nresult that next morning he wrote accepting the kind invitation, more\r\nthrough curiosity than desire.\r\n\r\nAlthough he led a quiet and retired life, generally speaking, still he\r\ndid not absent himself totally from a few social meetings occasionally,\r\nand if imagination painted his future in the manner so artfully designed\r\nby Lady Dilworth, no doubt this visit to Dilworth Castle might convert\r\nit into reality.\r\n\r\nArriving at the elegant castle, with its tower of modern fame, and\r\nspires of Gothic structure, Sir John was met in its great hall by the\r\ngenial hostess, who conducted him to the brilliant reception-room,\r\nsuperbly laid out for the comfort of its guests; and being the first to\r\narrive, was thus afforded a good opportunity of inspecting the many\r\nvaluable relics and works of art that adorned its huge and velvety\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nOn the centre wall right opposite where he sat hung a painted portrait,\r\nlife-size, an admirable production of the well-known artist, "Peto," and\r\nnot knowing where such an original of perfection and beauty could be\r\nfound, he resolved to inquire, when opportunity offered, whose portrait\r\nit might\xa0be.\r\n\r\nAt this stage the numerous guests began to assemble, including the\r\nmajority of the leading gentry in and around Canterbury, as it was\r\nlooked upon as the chief social event of the season. Mothers were most\r\nfidgetty that their daughters should don their costliest gowns and\r\nbrilliants, as rumour had it that the noble heir to Dunfern estate\r\nshould honour the assembly with his august presence.\r\n\r\nReport gained ground that Sir John, having quietly crept out of boyhood\r\nfor a lengthened period, would end his days harnessed singly, but idle\r\ngossip, flying at all times kite-high, soon gave place in the wavering\r\nminds of society belles to that of more serious consideration and\r\nwelcome expectancy.\r\n\r\nOn being introduced to all those outside his present circle of\r\nacquaintance on this evening, and viewing the dazzling glow of splendour\r\nwhich shone, through spectacles of wonder, in all its glory, Sir John\r\nfelt his past life but a dismal dream, brightened here and there with a\r\ncrystal speck of sunshine that had partly hidden its gladdening rays of\r\nbright futurity until compelled to glitter with the daring effect they\r\nsoon should produce. But there awaited his view another beam of life\'s\r\nbright rays, who, on entering, last of all, commanded the minute\r\nattention of every one present--this was the beautiful Irene Iddesleigh.\r\n\r\nHow the look of jealousy, combined with sarcasm, substituted those of\r\nlove and bashfulness! How the titter of tainted mockery rang throughout\r\nthe entire apartment, and could hardly fail to catch the ear of her\r\nwhose queenly appearance occasioned it! These looks and taunts serving\r\nto convince Sir John of Nature\'s fragile cloak which covers too often\r\nthe image of indignation and false show, and seals within the breasts of\r\nhonour and equality resolutions of an iron mould. On being introduced to\r\nIrene, Sir John concluded instantly, without instituting further\r\ninquiry, that this must be the original of the portrait so warmly\r\nadmired by him. There she stood, an image of perfection and divine\r\nbeauty, attired in a robe of richest snowy tint, relieved here and there\r\nby a few tiny sprigs of the most dainty maidenhair fern, without any\r\nornaments whatever, save a diamond necklet of famous sparkling lustre\r\nand priceless value.\r\n\r\nAs the evening rolled into the small hours of the morning, the numerous\r\nguests began to repair to their respective homes, none of the weaker sex\r\nhaving had the slightest advancement in the direction of their coveted\r\nintentions, save Irene, who was fortunate in securing the attention of\r\nSir John Dunfern during the happy hours that fled so quickly.\r\n\r\nImmediately before taking his departure he pressed firmly her snowy\r\nhand, and left the pretty-gilded area which surrounded his first hopes\r\nof matrimony to enter what he was beginning to believe the weary\r\napartments of Dunfern Mansion, that previously had held him bound to\r\nthem in hermit-like fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nArouse the seeming deadly creature to that standard of joy and gladness\r\nwhich should mark his noble path! Endow him with the dewdrops of\r\naffection; cast from him the pangs of the dull past, and stamp them for\r\never beneath the waves of troubled waters; brighten his life as thou\r\nwouldst that of a faded flower; and when the hottest ray of that\r\nheavenly orb shall shoot its cheerful charge against the window panes of\r\nDunfern Mansion, the worthy owner can receive it with true and profound\r\nthankfulness. Three weeks had scarcely passed ere Sir John was made the\r\nrecipient of another invitation to Dilworth Castle. This second effusion\r\nof cordiality required neither anxious thought nor prolonged decision\r\nhow to act, knowing as he did that it would again serve to bring his\r\npresent thoughts into practice by affording him another opportunity of\r\nsharing in the loving looks of one for whom he feared there dwelt a\r\nstrong inclination on his part to advance his affection.\r\n\r\nIrene stood looking out on the lake beyond the richly draped window,\r\nruminating on the days of her childhood, which lent a look of dullness\r\nto the beautiful face that beamed with delight as Sir John Dunfern\r\nentered. The evening was very pleasantly and quietly spent, Irene\r\ncommanding the greater part of his time and attention, on account of\r\nLady Dilworth being slightly ailing, whose health, generally speaking,\r\nat this period was not so robust as formerly, and consequently failed to\r\nwarrant too many callers. As the clock struck eleven Sir John began to\r\nthink of returning home, feeling quite happy, fancying his great\r\naffection was returned in full by Irene.\r\n\r\nBeing very domesticated, and having the stiff ideas of a bachelor of\r\nlong standing so firmly imprinted in his nature, he felt very diffident\r\nin asking the object of his visit when next they should meet. But Lady\r\nDilworth entering before taking his departure, saved him putting the shy\r\nquestion by placing herself in his position and demanding the required\r\nreply. Sir John promised without further ceremony to visit them more\r\nfrequently in future, and left their midst with hasty step, lingering in\r\nthe hall to cast another look at the lovely form which stood not far\r\ndistant. Leisurely leaning back in his carriage, and burying himself in\r\nhis great and costly cloak demanded by the night\'s icy aspect, he rolled\r\nalong towards his home drowned in sweet thought of the beautiful girl\r\nwhom he only recently knew, but whose regard for her raged with such\r\nrambling anxiety as to convince him of the propriety of making her aware\r\nhow he meant to play the part of lover.\r\n\r\nUntil now he was inclined to be prejudiced against the snares and\r\nallurements of women, but he strongly resolved to try gradually and\r\nabandon every unkind thought harboured in his mind against them, fearing\r\nlest all his conjured imaginations were both unjust and selfish; and\r\ndetermined to drown them for ever in the clashing gulf of fate, felt a\r\nprouder and happier mortal than before.\r\n\r\nBut time would solve the problem and heal the wound which penetrated so\r\ndeeply his bosom. Yea, a\xa0short time he hoped would bring his creeping\r\nfever of endearment under the binding stay of appointed authority, and\r\nheal its weakening effects with the sacred salve of truth.\r\n\r\nNot until the horses dashed up the winding avenue with increased\r\nalacrity was he shaken from his meditating attitude, to be ushered once\r\nmore into his home of boundless wealth. The lonely stare of grave\r\nbewilderment took the place of happiness that formerly seemed built in\r\nabundance for him within its walls, as he entered the palatial and\r\ngorgeously equipped abode he principally inhabited, feeling the tinge of\r\nthe dull past filling him with entire despair, whilst meditating on the\r\nhappy future which presented itself to him. How in a trivial period this\r\nlonely spot, he thought, should prove the beacon of never-dying bliss,\r\nwhen once furnished with the most precious treasure on earth--a virtuous\r\nwoman! Ah! the very thought of his embosomed and anticipated alliance\r\nmade him nervously happy; and believing a bright and noble future lay in\r\nstore for the lonely owner of Dunfern Estate, he resolved to indulge\r\nnature in a few hours of calm repose.\r\n\r\nThe days moved along more quickly Sir John believed than formerly; and\r\npossibly he may have imagined this was so, as he felt no longer fettered\r\nwith fear of fighting with his inward friend--obstinacy, whose hand of\r\ndrowsy bachelorism seemed for ever closed to his changing charity; he\r\nhad at last thrown aside the garb of female dislike, and patronised that\r\nof a warm-hearted lover.\r\n\r\nIrene did not lead Lady Dilworth to believe that she really cared for\r\nSir John, and, when his name cropped up occasionally, she allowed\r\nherself always to keep the coast of conversation clear that would likely\r\nconvict her views most, and managed cleverly thereby to deceive the\r\nfriend who came not a day too soon to her rescue. Perhaps had Lady\r\nDilworth proved less concerned about the orphan charge she freed from a\r\nlife of toil, apparently, and instructed her more on the branches of\r\nintegrity, then the lovely youthful Irene could have decided more\r\nhonorably in all cases of questioning, and would have done justice, not\r\nalone to herself, but to all concerned; but, like many others similarly\r\nsurrounded with lovers, battling in the war of extremes, and encompassed\r\non all sides with apparent luxuries, she was confident she would some\r\nday come off victorious by acting the clever Corinthian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen on the eve of glory, whilst brooding over the prospects of a bright\r\nand happy future, whilst meditating upon the risky right of justice,\r\nthere we remain, wanderers on the cloudy surface of mental woe,\r\ndisappointment and danger, inhabitants of the grim sphere of anticipated\r\nimagery, partakers of the poisonous dregs of concocted injustice. Yet\r\nsuch is life.\r\n\r\nSir John\'s visits began now to be numerous at Dilworth Castle, each\r\nvisit serving further to strengthen the link of relationship, and bury,\r\nin the heaving breast of seeking solace, the dull delight of the weary\r\npast. As the weeks wore on, he reckoned them only as days, when\r\ncomparing their loving length with those of the bleak years he tried to\r\nenjoy alone, before taking such steps--yes, serious steps--as those\r\nfancied by the would-be bachelor.\r\n\r\nAt first he was careless and indifferent to the flowery harangues of\r\nmothers who paid him periodical visits, with their daughters, of\r\napology, and firmly retained the obstinate qualities of an autocratic\r\nruler, until softened in the presence of one he found he was learning to\r\nsteadily love. He believed now that the chief stripes,\r\nviz.--observation, inclination, advancement and accomplishment, in the\r\nwell-spun web of matrimony, must harmonise with the groundwork of\r\nhappiness, without which our lives are not worth an unstamped coin.\r\n\r\nLove\'s path, on which Sir John was known now to tread with the step of\r\nintensity, seemed smooth as the ice of Inglewood. There were no\r\nobstacles in his way of which he was yet aware, save imagination; this,\r\nalso, was chased from his mind by the evident and ample return of\r\nIrene\'s polished affection, the foul gloss of which he failed to notice,\r\nand whose pretentions were so cleverly carried out as to defy detection.\r\n\r\nIrene was an accomplished and clever girl, and well able to sustain her\r\nhidden regard throughout for one who for years previous had been\r\nendeavouring to remove the great barrier of position which blocked his\r\npath of approach towards her affection. As yet her parentage was totally\r\nunknown to Sir John; still, he felt it must not have belonged to the\r\nrude and ridiculous, since she possessed all the qualities, outwardly,\r\nand features, of a highly refined race. And when only a girl of eleven\r\nsummers, when the worthy hand of benevolence, friendship, and love\r\nclutched the tiny fingers of absolute want, there visibly seemed nothing\r\nlacking in appearance, manner, or education to solicit the pity or\r\nsuspicion of her charitable guardian and protector.\r\n\r\nSir John Dunfern\'s many visits of late to Dilworth Castle had been\r\ncreating quite a sensation throughout the quiet corners of costly\r\ncuriosity, until an announcement appeared in _Mack\'s Society Journal_ to\r\nthe following effect:--\r\n\r\n"A marriage is arranged to take place in August between Sir John\r\nDunfern, of Dunfern Mansion, County Kent, and Irene Iddesleigh, adopted\r\ndaughter of Lord and Lady Dilworth, of Dilworth Castle, in same county."\r\n\r\nThis notice, no doubt, caused the partakers in drawing-room\r\n_tet\xe8-a-tet\xe8s_ to share in the pangs of jealousy, with silent\r\nresentment. Perplexity, a\xa0little, would find refuge within the homes of\r\nmany who led Society by the string of superficial show and pompous\r\nimportance; and during the interval that elapsed between such an\r\nannouncement and its important celebration, many and infamous were the\r\ncharges poured forth against Irene Iddesleigh.\r\n\r\nThe month preceding Irene\'s wedding was one of merriment at Dilworth\r\nCastle, Lord and Lady Dilworth extending the social hand of fashionable\r\nfolly on four different occasions. They seemed drunk with delight that\r\nIrene, whom they looked upon as their own daughter, should carry off the\r\npalm of purity, whilst affluence, position, and title were for years\r\nwaiting with restless pride to triumph at its grasp.\r\n\r\nIt was at the second of these social gatherings that the first seed of\r\njealousy was sown within the breast of Sir John Dunfern, and which had a\r\ntendency to remain until it gradually grew to such a rapid state of\r\nmaturity as to be rooted, if possible, for ever from its dusty bed of\r\nambush.\r\n\r\nYes, when the merriment was at its height, and the heat too oppressive\r\nto allow much comfort to the corpulent, the espoused of Irene dropped\r\nunexpectedly out of the midst of the aristocratic throng, and being\r\npassionately an ardent admirer of the fairy-like fruits of the efforts\r\nof the horticulturist, directed his footsteps towards the well-filled\r\nconservatory at the south wing of the building.\r\n\r\nThe different-shaded lights which dangled from its roof bestowed a look\r\nof Indian exquisiteness on the many quaint and delicate productions of\r\nnature that rested daintily in their beds of terra-cotta tint.\r\n\r\nBut before leaving the room he vaguely scanned the throng to catch a\r\nglimpse of Irene, and failed to notice her amongst the many who danced\r\nso gaily to the well-timed tunes of the celebrated pianist, Charles\r\nWohden, whose musical touch was always capable of melting the most\r\nhardened sinner into moods of mellow softness, or cheering the most\r\ndowncast and raising their drooping look of sadness to that of\r\nhigh-strung hilarity.\r\n\r\nSir John wandered in and out through the numerous windings of sweetest\r\nfragrance, until arriving at the farthest corner, of rather darkened\r\nshade, and on a wire couch beheld the object of his pursuit, in closest\r\nconversation with her tutor, whose name he had altogether failed to\r\nremember, only having had the pleasure of his acquaintance a few hours\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n"Can it be possible?" exclaimed Sir John, in profound astonishment.\r\n"Why, I\xa0have been searching for you for some time past, and have\r\naccidentally found you at last!" Irene, rising to her feet in a second,\r\nwas utterly dazed, and had the dim lights shewed her proud face to\r\nadvantage, the ruddy glow of deepest crimson guilt would have manifested\r\nitself to a much greater degree. Making multitudinous apologies, etc.,\r\nshe at once joined Sir John, who led her back, in apparent triumph, to\r\nshare the next waltz.\r\n\r\nHow the true heart beat with growing passion during the remainder of the\r\nmerry festivity, and as the final announcement of separation was\r\nwhispered from ear to ear, the gradual wane of Love\'s lofty right would\r\nfain have dwindled into pompous nothing as the thought kept tickling his\r\nwarm enthusiasm with the nimble fingers of jealousy. That she whom he\r\nhad ardently hoped should share his future with sheer and loving\r\ncaresses of constant companionship and wife-like wisdom should be\r\ntrapped in probably vowing to another her great devotion for him!\r\n\r\nBut better allow the sickening thought to die on the eve of insult\r\nrather than live in the breast of him who, at no distant date, would\r\nhear the merry peals of wedding bells ring with gladness, and naturally\r\nrejoice at the object of their origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur hopes when elevated to that standard of ambition which demands\r\nunison may fall asunder like an ancient ruin. They are no longer fit for\r\nconstruction unless on an approved principle. They smoulder away like\r\nthe ashes of burnt embers, and are cast outwardly from their confined\r\nabode, never more to be found where once they existed only as\r\nsmouldering serpents of scorned pride.\r\n\r\nThe little chat that Irene apparently enjoyed in the conservatory would\r\ngladly have become an act of forgetfulness on her part had not Sir John\r\nreminded her of its existence a few days afterwards. The spark of\r\njealous passion had not fully died out after the incident referred to,\r\nand awaiting silently its decease, Sir John almost had grown a mourner\r\nto its imagined demise, following its undying remains so far as the\r\nvillage of Opportunity, when it was again to revive and shine as\r\nluminously as before.\r\n\r\nIt happened about three weeks preceding the day set apart for their holy\r\nunion, on Sir John arriving at the castle, he was informed of Irene\'s\r\nrecent exit, and gently turning away, he resolved to have a stroll in\r\nthe tastefully laid-out gardens with the sole object of meeting her.\r\n\r\nWalking leisurely along, and stooping to pick up some fallen fruit,\r\nhe suddenly heard a faint sound issue amongst the trees. Remaining\r\nbreathless for a few seconds, lest he might be deceived by the rippling\r\nsounds of the adjacent waves, he again heard the same sweet strain, but\r\nof much longer duration than before, and quietly moving towards the spot\r\nwhence it issued, another sound met his ear in the distance, which\r\nseemed to be the hasty tread of some one making good an escape, before\r\nhe got time to view the object he would eagerly have pursued, but\r\nchecking his desire somewhat, he allowed the matter to sink into\r\nsilence. Boldly moving towards the spot whence the sound of music\r\nissued, how delightfully surprised was he to find a\r\nmagnificently-constructed little summer-house, a\xa0charming pyramidal\r\nGothic structure, robed internally with mossy mantles of nature, and\r\nbrightened beyond conception with the instrument of humanity which gave\r\norigin to such pathetic and sweetened strains.\r\n\r\nPolitely offering an apology for intruding on the private little palace\r\nof Irene, who failed completely to hide her gross confusion from the\r\nkeen gaze of her espoused, who never seemed to notice in the least the\r\nsudden change that swept so swiftly over her pallid cheeks at his\r\nunexpected visit, Sir John sat down.\r\n\r\nIrene held in her snowy palms a roll of Italian music, which she\r\nearnestly endeavoured to conceal from his penetrating stare, probably on\r\naccount of the words contained therein, which for ever would be unknown\r\nto his varied sphere of knowledge, and which would undoubtedly have\r\nbetrayed her feelings, never dreaming that they should strike other ears\r\nthan those for whom they practically were intended.\r\n\r\nPerceiving her great excitement at the unexpected appearance of him,\r\nwho ever afterwards kept his jealous thoughts in silent motion, he\r\nabsolutely evaded making any inquiry whatever, or slightest allusion to\r\nthe name and nature of the parchment she so firmly retained. Sir John\r\nchatted gaily until he gained good ground for delivering to her the\r\nmessage that instinct had so prompted him to utter.\r\n\r\n"Irene, my beloved one," he began; "it is now only about a score of days\r\nuntil I hoped for ever to call you mine; a\xa0hope which unmercifully has\r\nhaunted me since I fortunately gazed on your lovely face; a\xa0hope which I\r\ntrusted should be fully appreciated by both you and me, and which, I\xa0now\r\nmust own, can never be realised until the clearance of the barrier that\r\nsince our engagement has been but too apparent.\r\n\r\n"The sole object of my visit, my dear Irene"--here Sir John clasped her\r\ntender hand in his--"tonight is to elicit from you a matter that lately\r\nhas cast a shadowy gloom over my anticipated bright and cheerful future.\r\nI\xa0am not one of those mortals who takes offence at trifles, neither am I\r\na man of hasty temper or words--quite the contrary, I\xa0assure you; but it\r\nhas, fortunately or unfortunately, been probably a failing amongst my\r\nancestors to court sensitiveness in its minutest detail, and, I\xa0must\r\nacknowledge, I\xa0stray not from any of them in this particular point.\r\n\r\n"I must acquaint you, though it pains me deeply to do so, that lately\r\nyou have not treated me with such respect or attention as you certainly\r\nlavished upon me before the announcement of our engagement, and for what\r\nreason or reasons I now wish to be apprised. You seem when in company\r\nwith others to ignore my remarks to you entirely, and treat them with\r\nproud disdain, as if shame took the place of pride at my wordy approach!\r\nI\xa0felt and do feel quite hurt, and am resolved that no such repetition\r\nshall take place in future. I\xa0promised to be at the castle last night,\r\nbut unfortunately I felt indisposed, and only that I wished to have a\r\nthorough understanding relative to your recent conduct, and which has\r\npained me acutely, I\xa0should not have ventured out of doors this evening\r\neither. I\xa0was, in consequence, obliged to write you last night, asking a\r\nwritten reply, which you failed to give! And this evening, instead of\r\nbeing doubly rejoiced at my presence, you, on the contrary, seem doubly\r\nannoyed! I\xa0therefore pray, my dearest Irene, that you will, and I am\r\npersuaded honestly, not hesitate to satisfy me regarding this\r\nunpleasantness, that should anything of which you are now aware cause\r\nyour conduct to be changed towards me, do not allow it a lair within\r\nyour breast, but confide in me as thou wouldst in a dearly-trusted and\r\nfaithful lover."\r\n\r\nAt this stage Irene began to consider seriously the earnestness that\r\naccompanied the words of Sir John, knowing well she had been guilty,\r\ngrossly guilty, of the charges with which he impeached her, and which\r\nwere mixed with child-like simplicity, descriptive only of a world-famed\r\nbachelor. She pondered whether or not honesty should take the place of\r\ndeceit--too often practised in women--and concluded to adopt the latter\r\nweapon of defence. Raising her hazel eyes to his, and clearing the weft\r\nof truth that had been mixing with the warp of falsehood to form an\r\nanswer of plausible texture, fringed with different shades of love,\r\nshe thus began:\r\n\r\n"My dearest and much beloved, I assure you your remarks have astounded\r\nme not a little! Your words sting like a wasp, though, I\xa0am quite\r\nconvinced, unintentionally. You are well aware that within a short\r\nperiod I will be marked out publicly as mistress of Dunfern mansion--an\r\nhonour revered in every respect by me; an honour to which I at one time\r\ndare never aspire; an honour coveted by many much more worthy than I,\r\nwhose parentage is as yet bathed in the ocean of oblivious ostentation,\r\nuntil some future day, when I trust it shall stand out boldly upon the\r\nbrink of disclosure to dry its saturated form and watery wear with the\r\nheat of equality. You are about to place me in a position which cannot\r\nfail to wring from jealousy and covetousness their flaming torch of\r\nabuse. Yes, Sir John, on me you have not ceased to lavish every\r\navailable treasure and token of your unbounded love. You have been to me\r\nnot only a loyal admirer, but a thoroughly upright and estimable example\r\nof life\'s purest treasures. You have resolved to place me by your side\r\nas your equal, whilst wealth in boundless store is thirsting for your\r\ntouch. You have elevated my unknown position to such a pitch as to defy\r\ntaunt or jeer, and at any time if I may have, seemingly, ignored your\r\nadvances, it was purely want of thought, and not through any underhand\r\nmotive or scheme whatever.\r\n\r\n"I assure you your allusion to my verbal answer last night is very\r\npronounced, and may be overlooked on the ground of pure disappointment.\r\nOur time of singleness is now short, and begging your forgiveness for my\r\nseeming neglect or indifference, I\xa0hope the tide, which until now has\r\nflown so gently, may not be stayed on the eve of entering the harbour of\r\nharmony, peace, and love."\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of Irene\'s answer of lavishing praises and flimsy\r\napologies, her affianced moved to the opposite corner of the rustic\r\nbuilding to scan the features of her he wholly worshipped and\r\nreluctantly doubted. Every sentence the able and beautiful girl uttered\r\ncaused Sir John to shift his apparently uncomfortable person nearer and\r\nnearer, watching at the same time minutely the divine picture of\r\ninnocence, until at last, when her reply was ended, he found himself,\r\naltogether unconsciously, clasping her to his bosom, whilst the ruby\r\nrims which so recently proclaimed accusations and innocence met with\r\nunearthly sweetness, chasing every fault over the hills of doubt, until\r\nhidden in the hollow of immediate hate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe silvery touch of fortune is too often gilt with betrayal: the\r\nmeddling mouth of extravagance swallows every desire, and eats the heart\r\nof honesty with pickled pride: the impostury of position is petty, and\r\nends, as it should commence, with stirring strife. But conversion of\r\nfeminine opinions tries the touchy temper of opposition, and too seldom\r\nterminates victoriously.\r\n\r\n"Great mercy! Only another week and I shall almost cease to be a free\r\nthinker! Just seven days more and what!--I shall openly have to confess\r\nto the world an untruth! Would there be any means of flight from the\r\ndangerous dragon that haunts me night and day? Could anything possible\r\nbe done to save myself from false alliance? Too late!--too late!\r\n\r\n"Only seven days and this beautiful boudoir shall own me no more, with\r\nits walls of purest white and gilded borders!\r\n\r\n"Just seven days and I shall be fettered with chains of dragging dislike\r\nand disappointment! Only seven days and thus shall end my cherished\r\nhopes, my girlish pride, my most ardent wish, but, alas! not my love!\r\nSeven days more shall see my own darling Os"---- Suddenly Irene was\r\naroused by the ringing of the breakfast bell, before she got time to\r\nfinish the sentence that troubled her weary brain for months before.\r\nDressing herself with frantic expertness, she dashed down the winding\r\nstaircase with an alacrity better imagined than described, and rushing\r\ninto the breakfast room where Lord and Lady Dilworth eagerly awaited\r\nher, presented the outward mocking appearance of being the happiest of\r\nmortals. Her beloved benefactors, who had been the prime movers in the\r\nmatter of matrimony, saw plainly a saddened look about the lovely face,\r\nwhich Irene tried hard to suppress, and asking why it appeared at this\r\ngay time, was answered evasively. Indeed, Lord and Lady Dilworth were\r\nwholly ignorant of the present state of affairs, nor did Irene reveal at\r\nany time to Lady Dilworth her great hatred for Sir John, or her maddened\r\ndesire to become the wife of a poor tutor.\r\n\r\nHad she only taken into her confidence her whose wise counsel and\r\nmotherly example were at all times a prompt step to decision; or had she\r\nonly hinted to Lady Dilworth her manifest inability to return Sir John\'s\r\ngreat affection, matters would probably have reached another climax. But\r\nowing to the present precarious position in which Lord and Lady Dilworth\r\nstood, and as yet unknown to both Irene and other most intimate\r\nacquaintances, great was Lady Dilworth\'s desire to see Irene permanently\r\nsettled, knowing as she did that ere the sun of another August day would\r\nflash its shimmering rays against the crystal stays of Dilworth Castle\r\nshe would be beyond easy access to Irene either in time of rejoicing or\r\nsorrowing.\r\n\r\nPreparations were at last almost completed for such an auspicious event.\r\nInvitations were issued numerously for the reception to be held at\r\nDilworth Castle after Irene\'s marriage, but sparingly during the\r\nceremony; all of which were mostly accepted. Costly, multiplying, and\r\nvaried were the gifts received by Irene; enough to make a princess stare\r\nwith startling bewilderment.\r\n\r\nAmongst the many, none came from Irene\'s tutor, Oscar Otwell! And\r\nalthough he was the first to whom Lady Dilworth addressed an invitation,\r\nstill there was no reply, much to the annoyance and astonishment of\r\nhostess on the one hand and knowledge of Irene on the other; as, verily,\r\nit was not unknown to Irene that absolute indifference to facts,\r\nseemingly of domestic importance, was a positive point in Oscar, and\r\nnever better exemplified than in the present existing state of affairs,\r\nwhich, sickly as it proved to Irene, was deadly so to Oscar.\r\n\r\nBut future facts had to be solved, which undoubtedly would be treated\r\nwith more comparative reverence than heretofore, by him who suffered\r\nseverely--yea, acutely--from the blow struck him on the eve of\r\naspiration and achievement. Love, alas! when smitten with the sword of\r\nindifference, dieth soon, but once struck on the tunnelled cheek of\r\nsecrecy with the hand of pity there leaves a scar of indelible\r\nintolerance, until wiped out for ever with the curative balsam of\r\nbattled freedom.\r\n\r\nSir John and Irene met in Dilworth Castle for the last time on the\r\nmorning of the third day of August, being the day set apart for the\r\ncelebration of their marriage. It commenced with the ringing of the\r\nvillage bells; the sun shone forth in all his universal glory; emblems\r\nof the approaching festivity did not fail to appear on the housetops of\r\nthe humblest village peasant; gladness reigned throughout the household,\r\nand all hearts, save two, rejoiced with unabated activity.\r\n\r\nIt was a morning never to be forgotten by Lord and Lady Dilworth, who,\r\non that day, would be robbed of the treasure held firm and fast by them\r\nfor the lengthened period of nine years, and which they yielded up with\r\nhearts of sorrow, not because of the change in which Irene should have\r\ntaken deep interest, but on account of the burthen of trouble which\r\nloaded them with leaden weights of which they could not possibly free\r\nthemselves. The intense excitement that for weeks before had found such\r\nrefuge within their cherished and much-loved home had not long now to\r\nlive: it would die on the doorstep of apparent bereavement never more to\r\nappear within Dilworth Castle under similar circumstances. They knew\r\nwell that the gnawing jaws of poverty, which for years had failed to\r\nexpose their grinding power, had reached the last and only bite of\r\nsudden termination, and thereby stamped their marks of melancholy so\r\nimpressively upon the noble brows of the worthy owners of Dilworth\r\nCastle, that time could never blot them from observation. As before\r\nstated few were those invited to be present at the wedding ceremony,\r\nwhich was to take place about twelve o\'clock noon.\r\n\r\nSir John arrived at the Castle shortly before that time, looking\r\ncharming indeed, whilst Irene, though departing from the rules laid down\r\nby Lady Dilworth, demanded from all present remarks bordering on\r\nsimilarity. She looked nervously pale, but queenly, and mastered\r\nthoroughly the exposure of the painful agony through which she was\r\npassing, knowing as she did and fully believed that "all is not gold\r\nthat glitters."\r\n\r\nIt may interest some to know that Irene silently and secretly resolved\r\nnot to array herself in white; she was reconciled that neither the\r\nmarriage robe of purity nor the too beaming wedding face was to appear\r\nbefore such devout and reverential Church dignitaries as the Bishop of\r\nBarelegs and Canon Foot, with highly impressed and open falsehood, as\r\nthat practised by her in the absence of labouring under such a solemn\r\nvow.\r\n\r\nWhat must have been the breathless surprise of Lady Dilworth chiefly,\r\nand those present also, who, only the evening previous, had been pouring\r\nsuch praises over the magnificent duchesse satin gown, which eligible\r\nParisian dressmakers pronounced their chief production of the season,\r\nwhen Irene appeared arrayed in an Irish poplin of the darkest visible\r\nshade of green, without either train or flower of distinction, not even\r\na speck of ribbon or border of lace, and no ornament only the valued\r\nnecklet which graced her pearly throat when first Sir John was tempted\r\nwith her enhancing beauty to bestow upon her his choice collection of\r\nlove\'s purest fragrance, which should cast the sweetest scent of mutual\r\nrelationship throughout the dazzling apartments of the mansion she was\r\nabout to grace.\r\n\r\nSo thunderstruck and grievously horrified did Lady Dilworth seem at the\r\nvague departure of Irene from her orders, that she dare not trust\r\nherself to offer her the first motherly embrace! Irene, perceiving the\r\ngreat embarrassment of her beloved Lady Dilworth, glided across the\r\nroom, and sitting down to the right of her upon whom she had that day\r\nflung, in the face of devotion, the last dregs of defiance, "begged to\r\noffer an apology for such unruly conduct," and added "that all would be\r\nrevealed at a future date when least expected."\r\n\r\nIn the very room where Sir John was first puzzled concerning the\r\nbeautiful portrait, was he now made the recipient of the original. After\r\nthe important ceremony was performed, and the register signed, Sir John\r\nand Lady Dunfern, when the usual congratulations were ended, left by the\r\none o\'clock train _en route_ for the Continent. Thus were joined two\r\nhearts of widely different beat--one of intense love, which hearsay\r\nnever could shake; the other of dire dislike, which reason could never\r\nalter.\r\n\r\n"Born under a lucky star," was the whispered echo throughout the\r\ndistinguished guests who sat down to breakfast after the junction of\r\nopposites. Yea, this was a remark of truth visibly, and might have kept\r\ngood during the remainder of their lives had not the tuitional click of\r\nbygone attachment kept moving with measured pace, until stopped after\r\nmonths, or it may be, small years of constant swinging.\r\n\r\nDid Lady Dunfern ever dream that her apology for disobedience to Lady\r\nDilworth\'s orders, in not arraying herself in the garb of glistening\r\nglory, could ever be accepted, even by the kind and loving Lady\r\nDilworth?\r\n\r\nDid she imagine for a moment that she, to whom she owed anything but\r\ndisobedience, even in its simplest form, should be wrested from her arms\r\nof companionship ere her return to Dunfern Mansion? Did the thought ever\r\nflash through her mind that never again would she be able to pour into\r\nthe ear of her trusted helper the secrets of the heart of deception,\r\nwhich, for the past seven months, had raged so furiously within her?\r\n\r\nBetter leave her to the freedom of a will that ere long would sink the\r\nship of opulence in the sea of penury, and wring from her the\r\nwords:--"Leave me now, deceptive demon of deluded mockery; lurk no more\r\naround the vale of vanity, like a vindictive viper; strike the lyre of\r\nliving deception to the strains of dull deadness, despair and doubt; and\r\nbury on the brink of benevolence every false vow, every unkind thought,\r\nevery trifle of selfishness and scathing dislike, occasioned by\r\ntreachery in its mildest form!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nDistant shores have great attractions and large expectations. They\r\nharbour around their beaches the exile and patriot, the king and\r\npeasant, the lawyer and artisan, the rising swindler and ruined prince.\r\nSpotted throughout the unclaimed area of bared soil may be seen the\r\nroughly-constructed huts and lofty homes of honest industry. Yes, and\r\nconcealed therein are hearts yearning for the land of nativity and\r\nnational freedom; hearts which sorrow after bygone days, and sink low\r\nwhen brooding over the future tide of fortune which already has stopped\r\nits gentle flow.\r\n\r\nThe reception on the evening of Irene\'s marriage was glorious and\r\nbrilliant, as were all those given by Lord and Lady Dilworth, and,\r\nalthough attended by society\'s cream alone, there appeared a visible and\r\nunhidden vacancy in the absence of her who so often lent a glow of\r\ngaiety to the high-toned throng.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be no rival now of buried lineage to mar their desire,\r\nor incur the jealousy of would-be opponents; no one to share\r\nsympathetically with the afflicted sister of equality and worth; nor was\r\nthere any one present of such knightly and commanding dignity as he,\r\nwho, not many hours previous, had taken upon him the sad duty of\r\ndelivering up the keys of devotion to her who kept the door of ardent\r\nadoration locked against his approach.\r\n\r\nIt would probably be a long time ere such a scene of silly jealousy and\r\nire would take place as that witnessed, in which the greater majority of\r\nthose present were then partakers! And, further, it would surely be a\r\nmuch longer period before these guests would again share alike in the\r\ngenerosity so often extended them by Lord and Lady Dilworth.\r\n\r\nNext day after Irene\'s marriage was a busy one at Dilworth Castle; hasty\r\nand numerous were the preparations for desolation and departure. Weeks\r\npreceding the joyful event, or what should have been, were leisurely\r\ndevoted to the artistic arrangements in every room within the lordly\r\nmanor. But, alas! so sudden now was joy\'s termination, that hours alone\r\nwere the boundary of command.\r\n\r\nIt may be stated that Lord Dilworth owned three very extensive estates,\r\nnamely--Dilworth, Ayrtown, and Howden. The first-mentioned extended\r\naround the castle of that name, encompassing a spacious tract of soil\r\nindeed, and might have done justice to moderation in its most expensive\r\nform. The Ayrtown Estate, which entirely covers the southern portion of\r\nCheshire, owns a magnificent Hall, the residence of the Earl of\r\nTukesham, and, although not considered so lucrative as Dilworth, may be\r\nestimated a handsome dowry for the son of any rising nobleman in the\r\nrealm. The Howden Estate, on which are elegantly formed two buildings of\r\nnote--namely, Blandford Castle and Lauderdale Lodge, both exquisite\r\nconstructions of architecture and skilled workmanship, and occupied\r\nrespectively by Sir Sydney Hector and Admiral Charles Depew--lies\r\nchiefly around the south-west of Yorkshire, and is not quite so\r\ndesirable or adapted for agriculture as the two first mentioned, being\r\nmostly rented for grazing purposes by the numerous and varied owners of\r\nits rugged plots. These estates became so heavily mortgaged that prompt\r\nsale was indispensable, and, the matter being quietly arranged six\r\nmonths beforehand, the sixth day of August was the day set apart for the\r\ndisposal of same.\r\n\r\nBidders were numerous and offers low. Eventually the purchasers were as\r\nfollow:--The Marquis of Orland bought Dilworth Estate; Lord Henry Headen\r\npurchased Ayrtown Estate, whilst the lot of Howden fell upon Sir Rowland\r\nJoyce, the famous historian and national bard.\r\n\r\nThus were wrested from Lord and Lady Dilworth their luxurious living.\r\nThey were driven from their nursery of rich and complicated comforts,\r\ntheir castle of indolence and ease. They were now thrown upon the\r\nshivering waters of want, without a word of sympathy in the dreadful\r\nhour of their great affliction, without home or friend to extend shelter\r\nor sustenance, and cast afloat upon the ocean of oscillating chance to\r\nspeed across it as best they could.\r\n\r\nWas Lord Dilworth therefore to be pitied? Were the torrents of gold\r\nwhich were bound to trickle from these enormous lands and dwellings,\r\nmanufactories and villages, too trifling for his use? Not a morsel of\r\npity was offered either him or Lady Dilworth as their circumstances\r\nbecame known in the homes of their associates, who so often fed on the\r\nfat of their folly and graced their well-lined tables always covered\r\nwith dainties of deserving censure.\r\n\r\nCould human mind contemplate that she who reigned supreme amongst\r\nsociety, she who gave the ball in honor of Irene Iddesleigh\'s marriage,\r\nshould ere four days be a penniless pauper? Yet such was fact, not\r\nfiction.\r\n\r\nThe seventh day of August saw Lord and Lady Dilworth titled beggars,\r\nsteering their course along the blue and slippery waves of the Atlantic,\r\nto be participators in the loathing poverty which always exists in homes\r\nsought after destruction, degradation, and reckless extravagance.\r\n\r\nSo soon may the house of gladness and mirth be turned into deepest\r\ngrief! How the wealthiest, through sheer folly, are made to drink the\r\nvery essence of poverty and affliction in its purest form! How the\r\ngolden dust of luxury can be blown about with the wind of events, and is\r\nafterwards found buried in the fields of industry and thrift! Their\r\nnames, which were as a household word, would now be heard no more, and\r\nshould sink into abject silence and drowned renown, leaving them to\r\nbattle against the raging war of ruin and hunger, and retire into\r\nsecluded remorse.\r\n\r\nOn the return of Sir John and Lady Dunfern from their honeymoon, after\r\nfour weeks sojourn, what was her ladyship\'s consternation on perceiving\r\nDilworth Castle in darkness as she and Sir John swept past its avenue on\r\ntheir way to their own brilliantly-lighted mansion? She was rather more\r\ntaciturn on the night of her return than even during her stay in\r\nFlorence, and it was only on her approaching her former place of\r\ntemporary retreat and touchy remembrances that words began to fall from\r\nher ruby lips in torrents.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, I implore of you, Sir John and husband, why the once blithe\r\nand cheerful spot of peace is now apparently a dismal dungeon on the\r\nnight of our home-coming, when all should have been a mass of dazzling\r\nglow and splendour?\r\n\r\n"Can it be that she who proffered such ecstacy for months before, on the\r\neve of our return, is now no more? or can it be possible that we have\r\ncrossed each other on the wide waters of tossing triumph or wanton woe?\r\n\r\n"Speak at once, for pity\'s sake! and do not hide from me the answer of\r\ntruth and honest knowledge? Oh, merciful heavens!"\r\n\r\nHere Lady Dunfern drooped her head before Sir John got time to even\r\nanswer a word, and drawing from his pocket a silver flask, proceeded to\r\nopen its contents, when the horses suddenly stopped, and a gentle hand\r\npolitely opened the carriage door to eagerly await the exit of his\r\nmaster and future mistress from its cushioned corners of costly comfort\r\nand ease.\r\n\r\n"Tom," cried Sir John, in great and rending agony, "kindly wait for a\r\nfew minutes, as her ladyship has been frightfully overcome only a short\r\ntime ago by the blank appearance in and around Dilworth Castle. She\r\nfears something dreadful must surely have happened Lady Dilworth in her\r\nabsence, since she has failed to make the occasion of our home-coming a\r\nmerry torchlight of rejoicing." Tom, who had been in Sir John\'s service\r\nfor the past twenty years, was about to testify to the truth of his\r\nremarks, when he was joined by other members of the household, who\r\nrushed to welcome their beloved master home once more, accompanied by\r\nhis beautiful bride, of whom they all had heard so much.\r\n\r\nSir John saw that delay was dangerous, and helping to remove his darling\r\nIrene from the seat on which she unconsciously reclined, succeeded in\r\nplacing her on a low couch in the very room he so often silently prayed\r\nfor her presence. Bathing her highly-heated temples with a sprinkling of\r\ncooling liquid concealed in his flask, Sir John lost no time in\r\nsummoning the village doctor, who, on arrival, pronounced Lady Dunfern\r\nto have slightly recovered, and giving the necessary orders left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nIt was fully two hours ere she partly recovered from her ghastly swoon,\r\nto find herself the object of numerous onlookers of the household of\r\nwhich she was now future mistress.\r\n\r\nPale and death-like did she appear in the eyes of her husband, who was\r\nutterly overcome with grief at the sudden collapse of his wife under\r\nsuch a stroke of anticipated sorrow; and more grieved was he still when\r\nhe found on inquiry that the removal of Lord and Lady Dilworth from\r\ntheir heightened haunt of highborn socialism must sooner or later be\r\nrevealed to her, who, as yet, had only tasted partly of the bitter cup\r\nof divided intercourse and separated companionship.\r\n\r\nMany, many were the questions asked by Lady Dunfern relative to Lady\r\nDilworth when Dr. Corbett arrived next morning to pronounce her almost\r\nrecovered, and, strange, yet true, that no one could possibly have\r\nhumoured her in such a manner to warrant recovery as the village doctor,\r\nuntil she felt really strong enough to battle against the sorrowful tale\r\nof woe with which Sir John should shortly make her cognisant.\r\n\r\nOn learning from his lips, so soon as her ability occasioned, the real\r\nstate of affairs concerning the emigrants who were now compelled to\r\nwander on the track of trouble, she received the truth with awe and\r\nsmothered distress. The new sphere in which Lady Dunfern was about to\r\nmove seemed to her strange; the binding duty which tied her firmly to\r\nhonour and obedience was kept prominently in vague view; the staff of\r\nmenials would probably find the rules of her husband more in accordance\r\nwith their wishes than those which she was beginning to already arrange.\r\nShe commenced her married life with falsehood, and she was fully\r\ndetermined to prove this feature more and more as the weeks and months\r\nrolled along. She was not now afraid of the censure of one whose face\r\nshe may never more behold, and who was the sole instigation of plunging\r\nher into a union she inwardly abhorred. Perhaps, had she never been\r\ntrained under the loving guidance of Oscar Otwell, her revered tutor,\r\nshe would only have been too eager to proclaim her ecstacy at her\r\npresent position more vigorously. But all fetters of power were visibly\r\nbroken which she wished should remain united, leaving her mother of her\r\nfuture premeditated movements.\r\n\r\nAs time moved on, Sir John and Lady Dunfern seemed to differ daily in\r\nmany respects, which occasioned dislike in the breasts of both, and\r\ncaused the once handsome, cheerful face of the much-respected owner of\r\nDunfern to assume a look of seriousness.\r\n\r\nThese differences arose chiefly through his great disinclination to\r\nattend the numerous social gatherings which awaited them after their\r\nmarriage. Sir John, finding it almost impossible to stare socialism in\r\nthe face, seemed inclined rather to stick to the old rule of domestic\r\nenjoyment, never forgetting to share fully his cheerful conversation\r\nwith his wife, when so desired, which, sorrowful to relate, was too\r\nseldom.\r\n\r\nNow that Lady Dunfern was an acknowledged branch of society, her elegant\r\npresence would have been courted by all those who so often favoured Lady\r\nDilworth with their distinguished patronage, but her social hopes being\r\nnipped in the bud by her retiring husband, she dare not resent, and\r\ndetermined, in consequence, to make herself an object of dislike in her\r\nhome, and cherish her imprisoned thoughts until released, for good or\r\nevil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nA word of warning tends to great advantage when issued reverently from\r\nthe lips of the estimable. It serves to allay the danger pending on\r\nreticence, and substantiates in a measure the confidence which has\r\nhitherto existed between the parties concerned. Again, a\xa0judicious\r\nadvice, extended to the stubborn and self-willed, proves futile, and\r\nincurs the further malice and fiery indignation of the regardless, the\r\nreckless, and the uncharitable.\r\n\r\nLady Dunfern began now to grow both cross and careless, and seemed not\r\nto interest herself so much (since her propositions were so emphatically\r\ndenounced by her husband) concerning the management of the household\r\nstaff. She grew daily more retired, and often has her conduct been so\r\npreposterously strange as to cause alarm both to Sir John and all over\r\nwhom he had immediate control.\r\n\r\nIndeed, three months of married life scarcely elapsed until she cast a\r\nglow of despair within the breast which too often heaved for her with\r\ntrue piety and love. And what was meant by such strange conduct on her\r\npart, her husband often wondered. Only the mighty cessation of\r\nfriendship caused by the flight of her beloved guardians, never\r\nattributing such silence and stubbornness to any fault he justly\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\nYes, the duped husband, when being fished for with the rod of seeming\r\nsimplicity and concealed character, and quickly caught on the hook of\r\ningenuity, with deception for a bait, was altogether unable to fathom\r\nits shallowest meaning. Was he not, therefore, to be sympathised with,\r\nwho so charitably extended the hand of honour and adoration to the\r\noffspring of unknown parents, and placed her in position equal to any\r\nlady of title and boasted parentage within the boundary of County Kent?\r\nShould Sir John Dunfern not have been almost worshipped by a wife whose\r\nbinding duty it was to reverence her husband in all things pertaining to\r\ngood? No doubt this would have been so had he gained the affections he\r\nimagined he possessed, but later on he would inevitably be made aware of\r\nmatters which as yet only bordered on supposition.\r\n\r\nDay after day Lady Dunfern pined like a prisoner in her boudoir, and\r\nscarcely ever shared a word with the great and good Sir John, who many\r\ntimes wished in former days that she had occupied his home and all its\r\njoys. She formed an inward resolution that if prohibited from enjoying\r\nlife, to which she was accustomed at Dilworth Castle, she would make her\r\nhusband, whom she knew too well made her his idol, feel the smart, by\r\nkeeping herself aloof from his caresses as much as possible.\r\n\r\nOften would he be found half asleep in deep thought, not having any\r\nfriend of immediate intimacy in whom he could confide or trust, or to\r\nwhom he could unbosom the conduct of his wife, whose actions now he was\r\nbeginning to detest.\r\n\r\nThe thoughts of disappointment and shame were building for themselves a\r\nhome of shelter within him--disappointment on account of cherished hopes\r\nwhich unmistakably were crushed to atoms beneath the feet of her who was\r\nthe sole instigation of their origin; shame, in all probability, lest\r\nthe love he sought and bought with the price of self might not be his\r\nafter all! and may still be reserved against his right and kept for\r\nanother much less worthy! The little jealous spark again revived and\r\nprompted him to renew its lustre, which had been hidden for a length of\r\ntime behind the cloud of dread so silently awaiting the liberty of\r\ncovering the hill of happiness.\r\n\r\nQuietly ruminating over his wife\'s manner before marriage, about which\r\nhe was compelled, through observation, to demand an explanation, and\r\npondering carefully her strange and silent habits since it, he became\r\nresolved to probe the wound that had swollen so enormously as to demand\r\nimmediate relief. Ringing furiously for a maid, he handed her a note, to\r\nbe delivered without delay to Lady Dunfern, the nature of which might\r\nwell be suspected. Be that as it may, its contents were instrumental in\r\ndemanding immediate attention.\r\n\r\nSoon after its delivery a slight tap was heard at the door of Sir John\'s\r\nstudy, this room being always his favourite haunt, where he sat beside a\r\nbright and glowing fire, engaged in sullen thought; and with an\r\nimperious "Come in!" he still remained in the same thinking posture;\r\nnor was he aware, for fully five minutes or so, that his intruder was no\r\nother than she whom he so recently ordered into his presence!\r\n\r\nGazing up in a manner which startled the cold-hearted woman not a\r\nlittle, he requested her "to have a seat right opposite his," to which\r\nshe instantly complied. At this moment the snow was wafting its flaky\r\nhandfuls thickly against the barred enclosures of Dunfern Mansion, and\r\nchilly as nature appeared outside, it was similarly so indoors for the\r\nfond and far-famed husband of Lord Dilworth\'s charge.\r\n\r\nMatters had appeared so unpleasant and altogether bewildering of late\r\nthat Sir John formed a resolution to bring them to a crisis. Looking\r\nfully into the face that seemed so lovely just now, with the dainty\r\nspots of blazing ire enlivening the pale cheeks of creeping sin, Sir\r\nJohn began--\r\n\r\n"Irene, if I may use such familiarity, I have summoned you hither, it\r\nmay be to undergo a stricter examination than your present condition\r\nprobably permits; but knowing, as you should, my life must be miserable\r\nunder this growing cloud of unfathomed dislike, I\xa0became resolved to\r\nend, if within my power, such contentious and unladylike conduct as that\r\npractised by you towards me of late. It is now quite six months--yea,\r\nweary months--since I shielded you from open penury and insult, which\r\nwere bound to follow you, as well as your much-loved protectors, who\r\nsheltered you from the pangs of penniless orphanage; and during these\r\nsix months, which naturally should have been the pet period of nuptial\r\nharmony, it has proved the hideous period of howling dislike!\r\n\r\n"I, as you see, am tinged with slightly snowy tufts, the result of\r\nstifled sorrow and care concerning you alone; and on the memorable day\r\nof our alliance, as you are well aware, the black and glossy locks of\r\nglistening glory crowned my brow. There dwelt then, just six months this\r\nday, no trace of sorrow or smothered woe--no variety of colour where it\r\nis and shall be so long as I exist--no furrows of grief could then be\r\ntraced upon my visage. But, alas! now I feel so changed! And why?\r\n\r\n"Because I have dastardly and doggedly been made a tool of treason in\r\nthe hands of the traitoress and unworthy! I\xa0was enticed to believe that\r\nan angel was always hovering around my footsteps, when moodily engaged\r\nin resolving to acquaint you of my great love, and undying desire to\r\nplace you upon the highest pinnacle possible of praise and purity within\r\nmy power to bestow!\r\n\r\n"I was led to believe that your unbounded joy and happiness were never\r\nat such a par as when sharing them with me. Was I falsely informed of\r\nyour ways and worth? Was I duped to ascend the ladder of liberty, the\r\nhill of harmony, the tree of triumph, and the rock of regard, and when\r\nwildly manifesting my act of ascension, was I to be informed of treading\r\nstill in the valley of defeat?\r\n\r\n"Am I, who for nearly forty years was idolised by a mother of untainted\r\nand great Christian bearing, to be treated now like a slave? Why and for\r\nwhat am I thus dealt with?\r\n\r\n"Am I to foster the opinion that you treat me thus on account of not\r\nsharing so fully in your confidence as it may be, another?\r\n\r\n"Or is it, can it be, imaginative that you have reluctantly shared, only\r\nshared, with me that which I have bought and paid for fully?\r\n\r\n"Can it be that your attention has ever been, or is still, attracted by\r\nanother, who, by some artifice or other, had the audacity to steal your\r\ndesire for me and hide it beneath his pillaged pillow of poverty, there\r\nto conceal it until demanded with my ransom?\r\n\r\n"Speak! Irene! Wife! Woman! Do not sit in silence and allow the blood\r\nthat now boils in my veins to ooze through cavities of unrestrained\r\npassion and trickle down to drench me with its crimson hue!\r\n\r\n"Speak, I implore you, for my sake, and act no more the deceitful\r\nDuchess of Nant\xe9, who, when taken to task by the great Napoleon for\r\nrefusing to dance with him at a State ball, replied, \'You honoured me\r\ntoo highly\'--acting the hypocrite to his very face. Are you doing\r\nlikewise?" Here Sir John, whose flushed face, swollen temples, and fiery\r\nlooks were the image of indignation, restlessly awaited her reply.\r\n\r\nLady Dunfern began now to stare her position fully in the face. On this\r\ninterview, she thought, largely depended her future welfare, if viewed\r\nproperly. Should she make her husband cognisant of her inward feelings,\r\nmatters were sure to end very unsatisfactorily. These she kept barred\r\nagainst his entrance in the past, and she was fully determined should\r\nremain so now, until forced from their home of refuge by spirited\r\naction.\r\n\r\nLet it be thoroughly understood that Lady Dunfern was forced into a\r\nunion she never honestly countenanced. She was almost compelled, through\r\nthe glittering polish Lady Dilworth put on matters, to silently resign\r\nthe hand of one whose adoration was amply returned, and enter into a\r\ncontract which she could never properly complete. All she could now do\r\nwas to plunge herself into the lake of evasion and answer him as best\r\nshe could.\r\n\r\n"Sir and husband," she said, with great nervousness at first, "you have\r\nsummoned me hither to lash your rebuke unmercifully upon me, provoked,\r\nit may be, by underhand intercourse. You accordingly, in the course of\r\nyour remarks, fail not to tamper with a character which as yet defies\r\nyour scathing criticism. Only this week have I been made the recipient\r\nof news concerning my deceased parents, of whom I never before obtained\r\nthe slightest clue, and armed with equality, I\xa0am in a position fit to\r\ntreat some of your stingy remarks with the scorn they merit.\r\n\r\n"You may not already be aware of the fact that I, whom you insinuate you\r\nwrested from beggary, am the only child of the late Colonel Iddesleigh,\r\nwho fell a victim to a gunshot wound inflicted by the hand of his wife,\r\nwho had fallen into the pit of intemperance. Yes, Earl Peden\'s daughter\r\nwas his wife and my mother, and only that this vice so actuated her\r\nmovements, I\xa0might still have lent to Society the object it dare not now\r\nclaim, and thereby would have shunned the iron rule of being bound down\r\nto exist for months at a time within such a small space of the world\'s\r\ngreat bed.\r\n\r\n"If my manner have changed in any way since our union, of it I am not\r\naware, and fail to be persuaded of any existing difference, only what\r\nmight be attributed to Lady Dilworth\'s sudden and unexpected removal\r\nfrom our midst, which occasioned me grief indeed.\r\n\r\n"It behoves elderly men like you to rule their wives with jealous\r\nsupervision, especially if the latter tread on the fields of youth. Such\r\nis often fictitious and unfounded altogether, and should be treated with\r\nmarked silence.\r\n\r\n"I may here say I was mistress, in a measure, of my movements whilst\r\nunder the meek rule of Lady Dilworth; nor was I ever thwarted in any way\r\nfrom acting throughout her entire household as I best thought fit, and\r\nsince I have taken upon me to hold the reins of similarity within these\r\nwalls, I\xa0find they are much more difficult to manage. I, more than once,\r\nhave given orders which were completely prohibited from being executed.\r\nBy whom, might I ask, and why? Taking everything into consideration,\r\nI\xa0am quite justified in acquainting you that, instead of being the\r\noppressor, I\xa0feel I am the oppressed.\r\n\r\n"Relative to my affections, pray have those courted by me in the past\r\naught to do with the present existing state of affairs? I\xa0am fully\r\npersuaded to answer, \'Nothing whatever.\'\r\n\r\n"You speak of your snowy tufts appearing where once there dwelt locks of\r\nglossy jet. Well, I\xa0am convinced they never originated through me, and\r\nmust surely have been threatening to appear before taking the step which\r\nlinks me with their origin.\r\n\r\n"I now wish to retire, feeling greatly fatigued, and trusting our\r\nrelations shall remain friendly and mutual, I\xa0bid thee good-night."\r\n\r\nLady Dunfern swept out of the room, and hurrying to her own apartment,\r\nburst into an uncontrollable fit of grief.\r\n\r\nShe had surely been awaked from her reverie by Sir John, and felt\r\nsharply the sting of his remarks, which were truly applied, indeed.\r\nShe now resolved to let matters move along as quietly as possible until\r\nafter she should pass the most critical period of her existence. She was\r\nprepared to manifest her innocence throughout, without detection if\r\npossible. But amongst the household there moved a matron under whose\r\nhawk-like eye Lady Dunfern was almost inclined to shrink. She felt when\r\nin her presence to be facing an enemy of unbounded experience. She\r\nabhorred her stealing tread, but not without cause. It was to this dame\r\nshe so often issued orders that never were carried out; and when\r\nintimating to Sir John the necessity of instantly dismissing such a\r\ntyrant, he quietly "rebelled," adding "that she had been almost twenty\r\nyears in his service, and presently could not think of parting with such\r\na valued and much-trusted friend."\r\n\r\nThis woman\'s name was Rachel Hyde, and proved the secret channel of\r\nintercourse between Sir John and Lady Dunfern, evidently paving the way\r\nfor her ladyship\'s downfall; as Rachel, being mistress for such a period\r\nover Dunfern Mansion, could never step the fence leading to abolition of\r\npower, which she so unwillingly tried to mount since Sir John\'s\r\nmarriage, and failing totally in her attempt, was lifted and thrown over\r\nby her mistress, an act she could never forget, and consequently carried\r\nall news, trivial or serious, concerning Lady Dunfern to her master, and\r\ndelivered it in such an exaggerated form as to incur his wrath, which\r\nalready had been slightly heated.\r\n\r\nA few months elapsed again, during which time matters went on much as\r\nusual, until an event happened that should have chased the darkest cloud\r\nof doubt and infidelity from the noble brow of the mighty and revered\r\nmaster of Dunfern Mansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thickest stroke of sadness can be effaced in an instant, and\r\nsubstituted with deeper traces of joy. The heart of honest ages, though\r\nblackened at times with domestic troubles, rejoices when those troubles\r\nare surmounted with blessings which proclaim future happiness.\r\n\r\nOn the tenth day of June, following Lady Dunfern\'s interview with her\r\nhusband, she gave birth to a son and heir. This great event brought with\r\nit entire forgiveness on the part of Sir John of his wife\'s recent\r\nconduct. It served for a short time only, a\xa0trivial portion too, to\r\nstifle the alienation which existed between them, and to heal the sore\r\nof evident separation that marred their happiness for months before.\r\n\r\nThe glad and happy father was only too eager now to snatch a smile from\r\nhis wife\'s face, and anxious was he to bury any little obstacle that may\r\nhave existed in the past, and expel it for ever from its lurking corner\r\nof tempting repose. He saw that Lady Dunfern\'s life was hanging by a\r\nflimsy hair, and who could, for an instant, depict the great despair of\r\nher husband when told that all hope must be abandoned!\r\n\r\nThe frantic father wrung his hands in a frenzy of momentary madness, and\r\nin spite of authoritative advice he timidly moved in the direction of\r\nthe bed on which his beloved lay, and knelt beside it to fervently offer\r\nup a prayer "for the speedy recovery of her who was the chief object of\r\nhis existence." Raising himself up and clasping his darling in his arms,\r\nhe whispered in her ear a word of encouragement, and gently laying her\r\nhighly-heated head on the silken pillow he again prayed, in deepest and\r\ngravest earnestness, "that she might be spared only a little longer."\r\n\r\nNo doubt his prayer was no sooner offered than answered, as she at this\r\nstage slightly rallied, and appeared somewhat strengthened. Day by day\r\nthe still fond and loving husband sat by the bedside of the invalid\r\nuntil strong enough to battle fully against the weakening hand of her\r\nmalady; and at the very time Sir John sat beside the bed of sickness,\r\ninwardly "showering blame upon himself for hindering his wife\'s social\r\nenjoyment, and for which he believed he acted wrongly;" she, on the\r\ncontrary, was outwardly pouring rebuke on her own head "for ever\r\nentering into a league of life-long punishment by marrying a man she\r\nsimply abhorred, and leaving her noble and well-learned tutor, Oscar\r\nOtwell, whom she yet loved, to wander in a world of blighted bliss!"\r\n\r\nAh! to be sure! It was during these days of unremitting attention that\r\nhe was afforded an opportunity of storing up a multitude of touchy\r\nremarks uttered by his wife when the relapse of raging fever reached its\r\ndefiant height! She never ceased to talk in a most gentle manner of\r\n"Oscar Otwell," "her darling and much-loved tutor." She even expressed\r\nsorrow, in the course of her broken remarks, "at the false step she had\r\ntaken to satisfy, not herself by any means, but Lady Dilworth!" She\r\nstrongly protested her "hatred for him" who sat listening, with grave\r\nintensity, to every word that escaped her lips! She even spoke of\r\n"a\xa0cavity in her jewel-case in which was safely deposited a ring, given\r\nher by Oscar during her happy period of instruction under his guidance,"\r\nadding, in her painful discourse, that "she loved it as well as\r\nhimself," etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThese rambling statements when ended, in an instant caused Sir John\'s\r\nresolutions, made by him so recently, to become worthless remarks; and\r\nif partly charged with jealousy before, he was doubly so now.\r\n\r\nNo onlooker could fail in the least to pity the sneered husband, whose\r\nlivid countenance during the course of her remarks, rambling though they\r\nwere, was a sight never to be forgotten. How he gazed with astonished\r\nindifference at the invalid so charged with deceit! She who acted the\r\nemblem of innocence at all times, and attempted to attach entire blame\r\nto her husband! She who partly promised peace in future to him who never\r\nagain could enjoy\xa0it!\r\n\r\nHow his manner became so abrupt and his speech so scanty within such a\r\nshort period was verily a proof of the belief he fostered relative to\r\nhis wife\'s statements, which were yet to her unknown.\r\n\r\nThe doctors in attendance endeavoured strongly to imprint upon Sir John\r\nthe fact that "such remarks as those uttered by his wife should be\r\ntreated with silence and downright indifference," adding that "patients\r\nsmitten with fever, of what kind soever, were no more responsible for\r\ntheir sayings than the most outrageous victim to insanity."\r\n\r\nSir John listened attentively to their statements, but failed to be\r\naltogether convinced as to their truth. Wondering what sin could be\r\nattached to an act he felt was his duty to perform, he moved softly to\r\nthe bedside of his wife, and being in a sleepy mood, he resolved to sift\r\nsome of her remarks to the very bottom.\r\n\r\nEntering the room she so often occupied, and taking from a chink in her\r\ndressing-table a key of admittance to the jewel-case she spoke of, he\r\nlost no time in viewing its valuable contents; and, in the very spot in\r\nwhich she vowed dwelt her tutor\'s gift, there it lay! A\xa0golden band with\r\npearl centre, and immediately underneath it there rested a note. At\r\nfirst he felt rather diffident about perusing its contents, but instinct\r\nso prompted his curiosity that he yielded to its tempting touch. It ran\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n      "Hedley,\r\n          Berks,\r\n              July 3rd.\r\n\r\n  "Ever beloved Irene,\r\n\r\n  "I am after reading your gentle yet sorrowful epistle. You cannot\r\n  possibly retract the step you so publicly have taken without\r\n  incurring the malice of Lord and Lady Dilworth, who have sheltered\r\n  you from every sorrow and care with which you otherwise were bound\r\n  to come in contact.\r\n\r\n  "They received you into their elegant home, and shielded you,\r\n  by so doing, from the tyrannical rule of Miss Lamont of \'The\r\n  Orphanage,\' in which you were placed for a period of eight years.\r\n  They failed not to give you a thorough and practical education,\r\n  which in itself would enable you to achieve independence, if\r\n  necessary, or so desired.\r\n\r\n  "This you received under one whose heart now beats with raging\r\n  jealousy and vehement hatred towards the object of Lady Dilworth\'s\r\n  choice, being well convinced, through your numerous letters to me\r\n  lately, it never was yours.\r\n\r\n  "Dearest Irene, the thought of parting from you for ever is partly\r\n  sustained with the hope of yet calling you mine! Through time you\r\n  suggest an elopement, which as yet can only be viewed in the hazy\r\n  distance; but it seems quite clear to me, dearest, and surely\r\n  evident, that you abhor the very name of him who a month hence\r\n  shall place you in a position considerably more elevated and\r\n  lucrative than that which I now could bestow. But Irene, my\r\n  beloved, my all! reluctantly I yield my precious treasure to him\r\n  who, it may be this moment, is rejoicing at his capture.\r\n\r\n  "I shall ever remain forlorn, dejected, and ruined until such time\r\n  as we suitably can accomplish the clearance of the cloud of\r\n  dissatisfaction under which you are about to live. Please write by\r\n  return.\r\n\r\n            "Ever your own\r\n\r\n                "OSCAR.\r\n\r\n  "Miss Iddesleigh,\r\n\r\n        Dilworth Castle."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen dreading the light of day contentment hath fled; imagination\r\noftentimes proves a forerunner to reality; corners of horror shelter\r\nthemselves within the castles of the queenly, the palaces of the\r\npowerful, the monuments of the mighty, and the cottages of the\r\ncaretaker; but sunshine brings universal joy wherever its beams are wont\r\nto dazzle, and often allays the anxiety which precedes its appearance.\r\n\r\n"Great heaven!" murmured Sir John, as the tutor\'s note fell from his\r\nnervous grasp, "Am I blind to touch or truth? Am I at last to labour\r\nunder the fact that my wife loves another! she who only some months\r\nsince protested her innocence in such strains as to cause the most\r\ndoubtful to stay alarm. Here is the ring, and there lies the note--the\r\nnote of him who claims to be not only her tutor but suitor. Why did she\r\naccept the former or cause the latter to be written?"\r\n\r\n"Then, the date! Just one month exactly before our marriage; and how I\r\npined for it to elapse whilst another would eagerly have prolonged it.\r\nOh, Irene!--false and low woman! Think you that any longer I can own you\r\nas wife or treat you with the respect a wife deserves!" Sir John, ever\r\nopen to forgiveness, tried hard to master the dreadful spirit of\r\njealousy which arrived at last at its highest point, if he could feel\r\nconvinced that his wife\'s correspondence with her tutor ceased after her\r\nmarriage, believing if still it continued that other proofs of their\r\ndastardly plots would be forthcoming. Thrusting his hand again into the\r\naperture from which he took the two tributes of his wife\'s tutor, there\r\nappeared nothing to arouse further suspicion, save a Christmas card,\r\nwritten with the same bold hand. The lines were these:--\r\n\r\n    "Accept my warmest greeting, friendship, love,\r\n    Thou art my charming Irene, pet and dove;\r\n    Although another claims thee for a time,\r\n    I trust to call you some day ever mine.\r\n    Oh! pray for parting soon with fettered chains,\r\n    To live and move regardless of those reins\r\n    That bind your Christmas sprigs of worldly woe\r\n    To him, whom you have hated long ago."\r\n\r\nThis was a second effusion of Otwell\'s, and must have been received by\r\nLady Dunfern since her marriage; and, thought he who held it clutched in\r\nhis trembling hand, Why did she deposit this card amongst her\r\nvaluables--had she not held it as a treasure of priceless worth?\r\n\r\nNothing more was wanting now to convince the distracted husband of his\r\nwife\'s infidelity. Depositing the note, card, and ring in the drawer\r\nwhence he had taken them, Sir John at once proceeded to Lady Dunfern\'s\r\nbedroom, and found her awake. Being a nobleman of sterling worth, and\r\none on whose word the greatest dependence was always manifested, he\r\ncould scarcely fail to inform her of the great and trying scene he had\r\njust come through. Struggling, however, manfully from mentioning\r\nanything that would serve to retard her recovery, he moved towards the\r\nbed on which she lay, and before a word was uttered by him he suddenly\r\nstaggered and fell.\r\n\r\nWho could then perceive the wan and haggard appearance of him who\r\napparently lay lifeless without being totally terror-stricken--could\r\nshe, whom he bathed in golden comfort, behold this outstretched form\r\nwith calm silence? Surely not!\r\n\r\nInstantly ordering a maid to send for Doctor Doherty, the false invalid\r\nlay back on her pillow, appearing not much concerned. On the doctor\'s\r\narrival he applied restoratives, but without the desired effect. Then he\r\nordered his instant removal to his bed-chamber, where every care and\r\nwatchfulness was extended him by Rachel Hyde.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly two hours ere he manifested the remotest symptoms of\r\nanimation, and on inquiry the doctor pronounced the sudden shock he had\r\nnervously sustained to be grave indeed. Sir John lay in an unconscious\r\ncondition until next morning, when his first inquiry was relative to his\r\nson.\r\n\r\nGradually regaining strength, and venturing in the doctor\'s absence out\r\nof bed, he walked slowly into his wife\'s room to make personal his\r\nrecovery. He looked pale, and much annoyed, and could only with\r\ndifficulty refrain from acquainting her of what he had in store to\r\ncommunicate. Each day found both invalids, just and unjust, rapidly\r\nrecovering, and a few weeks found both completely restored to health and\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nLady Dunfern could not help noticing the strange and frozen manner of\r\nher husband since the eve of his illness. At first she was inclined to\r\nfear his approach, but gradually she felt convinced he was slightly\r\naffected with a mild form of insanity; and making minute inquiries from\r\nthe oldest inhabitants in the neighbourhood and adjoining village as to\r\nthe accuracy of her fears, she was informed that "such never existed\r\namongst his ancestors, so far as they knew or heard."\r\n\r\nWas it strange that Sir John felt a changed man towards her who was so\r\nfully charged with deceit? Would it have been acting in accordance with\r\nhis conscience to overlook her wily artifice? Could the once fond and\r\nloving husband, the brave and gallant knight, still trust in her whom he\r\nfelt convinced would bring a world of disgrace, not alone upon himself,\r\nbut upon one who in after years, he trusted, would proudly sustain the\r\nhonourable reputation of his race?\r\n\r\nAh! no matter in what light he viewed her conduct now he was brought to\r\nloathe her very look, and was fully determined to shut her in from the\r\ngaze of an outside world, or the cunning tricks of a trifling tutor. He\r\nwas resolved, so far as lay in his power, to treat her with the conduct\r\nshe merited, and never again allow himself to be persuaded to postpone\r\nthe visitation of his anger by her villainous pitiful appeals.\r\n\r\nAfter serious thought, Sir John began to act; he was inclined to think\r\ndelay would be dangerous, and on approaching his breakfast table one\r\nmorning soon after his recovery, he hinted to his housekeeper that he\r\n"wished a private interview with her after his morning repast." This\r\nRachel punctually obeyed.\r\n\r\nSeeing her master\'s trembling hand twitch the tips of his beard, she\r\nfeared something dreadful must surely be disturbing his peace of mind,\r\nand commanding her to "lock the door" lest they should be interrupted,\r\nhe informed her of all that had happened.\r\n\r\nRachel, ever ready to sow doubt in the mind of her master regarding his\r\nwife, manifested her want of surprise by relating some incidents which\r\noccurred under her notice. Nothing, however monstrous, could astonish\r\nSir John at this time regarding his wife\'s movements, and informing\r\nRachel of his intention he ordered the key of one of the rooms that yet\r\nhad been shut against the entrance of Lady Dunfern.\r\n\r\nHastening to fulfil her master\'s order, Rachel returned with the mighty\r\nkey, and handed it to Sir John, who moved to the door, and thrusting the\r\nrusty key into its aperture, succeeded with great difficulty in\r\neffecting an entrance. Rachel followed, and both entered, locking the\r\nheavy-panelled oak door from within. "This," said Sir John, "is the room\r\nof correction, the room of death. It defies escape or secretion. It has\r\nbeen so long as I remember held in abhorrence by my late lamented\r\nparents, and, so far as I can understand, by many of my ancestors.\r\n\r\n"First of all, the lady who shared its midst was a born imbecile, the\r\neldest daughter of my great great grandfather--Sir Sydney Dunfern. She\r\nwas nursed and tenderly cared for within these walls for a period of\r\nthirty-six years, and through the instantaneous insanity of her ward,\r\nwas marked a victim for his murderous hand. Yes, it has been related\r\nthat during midnight, when she was fast asleep, he drew from that\r\ndrawer" here Sir John pointed to the wardrobe, "a\xa0weapon of warlike\r\ndesign, and severed her head almost from her body, causing instant\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n"It was not known until next day about noon that anything extraordinary\r\nhad happened. It was first detected by Sir Sydney himself, who became\r\nalarmed at not having seen Wade--the ward\'s name was Hector Wade--as\r\nusual at ten o\'clock, and tapping at the door, was surprised to hear\r\nsome noise issue from within. Being of a hasty temper, he became\r\nindignant at the ward\'s indifference, and calling loudly, finally gained\r\nadmittance.\r\n\r\n"The murderer had her stretched on this floor, and every article capable\r\nof being removed piled upon her corpse. Horrified at such a sight, Sir\r\nSydney became wild with grief, and at once handed the pitiful lunatic\r\nover to those in authority.\r\n\r\n"The next inhabitant doomed to share in its dull delight was Kathleen,\r\nwife of my beloved grandfather, a\xa0beautiful woman, whose portrait you\r\nnow see. She, I\xa0am sorry to relate, proved more an accomplice than the\r\nhonoured wife of him who added so much to the welfare of those who now\r\nbenefit by his great economy. The hand of death visited her here\r\nlikewise with its separating touch.\r\n\r\n"The last person inhabiting its cheerless enclosure was a distant\r\nrelative of my mother, a\xa0gentleman named Rodney Rupert, who fell from\r\nthe path of virtue and trod the field of vice, until confined within\r\nthis prison of pathetic account, and who, in a moment of passion, ended\r\nhis days with that pistol which hangs on yonder hook, and on that bed\r\nall these lay, and which shall again be made use of by a traitoress of\r\nno mean account either."\r\n\r\nSir John then proceeded to give orders to "have the room made as\r\ncomfortable as its scanty furniture permitted," which consisted only of\r\none small table, one chair, and an old-fashioned wardrobe, with several\r\nsmall drawers attached, one dressing-table and wash-stand, all of which\r\nwere magnificently carved oak and richly panelled.\r\n\r\nThere was only one large window, made up of iron bars and a multitude of\r\nsmall panes of glass not larger than three inches square, all of equal\r\ndimensions, and inside this window were strong bars of iron looped on\r\nevery side and firmly fastened.\r\n\r\nThe cocoa matting which served as a carpet, parts of which were grim\r\nwith gore, was almost worn past recognition. These were all the articles\r\nthis badly-lighted room contained, save several oil-paintings of\r\nenormous size. On the whole, it presented the appearance of a private\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nAn icy atmosphere pervaded throughout the room, damped with an odour of\r\nsomething inert, which Sir John believed would be rendered extinct in\r\nthe presence of a fire.\r\n\r\nRachel, after receiving orders in confidence from her master, set\r\nmatters to right by lighting a fire, dusting the old and much-worn\r\nfurniture, airing the bed-clothes, etc., being strictly charged to\r\nadmit, on no pretence whatever, now or at any time, any member of the\r\nhousehold or visitor to the mansion.\r\n\r\nWhen everything was in perfect readiness for the reception of its guest,\r\nSir John directed Rachel to "bring her Ladyship into his presence." What\r\ncould have astonished Lady Dunfern more on being ushered into a room\r\nwhich never before was open for her inspection? Nothing save the\r\ninformation her husband eagerly awaited her to receive. On being\r\ninformed of her vast deception, which was proved beyond doubt, and to\r\nwhich she felt wholly incompetent to reply, she was absolutely\r\ndumb-stricken.\r\n\r\nIt required no further questioning now concerning her husband\'s recent\r\nstrangeness of manner and rigid coolness with which he was forced to\r\ntreat her whom he scorned to call wife.\r\n\r\n"You, madam," said he, "have by your conduct, both before and after\r\nmarriage, forced me to keep you a prisoner within these walls so long as\r\nyou live or I exist.\r\n\r\n"You have not failed to act the infamous by kissing me with the lips of\r\na Judas! You have at last plunged me into deepest disgrace, not alone\r\nme, but him whom you should have been liberated to succour and chastise.\r\nMocking wretch! your foul deeds shall have plenty of scope here for\r\nimprovement, and a prisoner you shall be during the remainder of your\r\nlife."\r\n\r\nSir John, without another word, glided from before the presence of her\r\nwho once was treated as a goddess by him, and turning the great key that\r\nlocked her for ever from his view, handed it to Rachel, who was to have\r\nsole admittance to, and full charge of, his wife.\r\n\r\nWhen left to herself in the ghostly and spacious closet of crippled\r\nright, which until now she never dare approach, Lady Dunfern, instead of\r\nshewing signs of grief, which Sir John felt assured must burst from its\r\nmidst, gloried in being aloof from the occasional rebukes to which she\r\nwas subject whilst occupying the rooms free to her access. She would now\r\nhave full opportunity of guiding her thoughts to self-advantage or\r\ndisadvantage. She felt free to try and act as she in any case would have\r\ndone, regarding very little the shame brought on her husband by her\r\nintrigue with the tutor, whom she simply idolized, never once casting a\r\nthought on her infant, knowing well it would be passionately cared for.\r\n\r\nOceans of thought took hold on her as she vacantly viewed the damp and\r\ndarkened walls of her monstrous cell, now and then moving forward to\r\ninspect the many paintings of great and historic worth which hung from\r\ntheir lofty support, mostly all more or less resembling him who probably\r\nshould ere long add to their number.\r\n\r\nLady Dunfern allowed the weeks and months to pass unheeded until\r\nafforded ample opportunity of resorting to some means that might not\r\nalone free her from such death-like surroundings, but snap the chain of\r\nobligation in two which presently connected her with a husband she cared\r\nnot for.\r\n\r\nShe longed for the hour of flight from the dismal shelter under which\r\nshe was doomed to dwell. She yearned for the days that had fled, and\r\nmore so for her who had shared in their pleasure. She pined for him whom\r\nshe so long lived to adore, and hesitated not to do so still.\r\n\r\nCould she only acquaint him of her husband\'s cruelty, how he might\r\nassist her in effecting her release. What could be done, she frequently\r\nasked herself, to brighten her future only a little?\r\n\r\nCould she possibly escape? She feared not.\r\n\r\nEvery two hours that villainous woman entered during the day since first\r\nshe was snared in the net of revenge and compelled to remain within its\r\nenclosures of shivering fear. Still, she never lost hope of flight, and\r\ncheered with the thought of future stratagem, she tried to remain\r\nsomewhat consoled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trickling tide of fortune sometimes ebbs slowly. It meets with\r\noccasional barriers of boisterous worth, and reaches its haven of intent\r\ntoo often with obstruction. Its waters drip on the proud and humble, the\r\nmighty and pitiful, the meek and unholy, and refuse to overlook even the\r\nweary and careworn confined in the cell. It ceases not to store within\r\nits waters of wonder intricate windings of wealth and poverty, triumph\r\nand torture, joy and misery, and does not hesitate at any time to safely\r\ndeposit its various burthens on the numerous beaches along which it must\r\npass.\r\n\r\nWhen almost a year of Lady Dunfern\'s private imprisonment was about\r\ndrawing to a close, she was beginning to partly believe the truth of her\r\nhusband\'s dogmatic remarks. She had strongly been endeavouring during\r\nthis time to arrive at some possible means of communication with Marjory\r\nMason, her much-loved maid, whose services Sir John still retained; but\r\nevery endeavour she yet formed proved absolutely vain. She often thought\r\nhad she been attended by any of the household staff, only her on whom\r\nshe never could dream to rely, she might have made good her escape long\r\nsince; but being watched and visited so regularly by Rachel Hyde, she\r\nfelt her task much more difficult of performance than at first imagined.\r\nSometimes she would bring her table close to the window and mount on its\r\nshaky leaf, then step into the great window-sill, pull out her\r\nhandkerchief and rub the puny panes to try and catch a glimpse of nature\r\nand probably chance to see some of the servants pass.\r\n\r\nThis heavily-barred window stood considerably high, and if viewed from a\r\ndistance, or even from the ground adjacent, seemed small in consequence.\r\nIt was, therefore, very difficult for her to recognise one menial from\r\nanother, yet she often imagined she could not be mistaken in perceiving\r\na form in the garden, right opposite, that surely strongly resembled her\r\nfavourite maid.\r\n\r\nWhat course was she, then, to adopt in order to discover the accuracy of\r\nher thoughts? How could she manage to be positive regarding Marjory\'s\r\nappearance? She felt it almost miraculous to identify her who trod so\r\nfar beneath her heightened gaze. Each day she resolved to mount the\r\nwindow at the same hour, believing her constant watching might through\r\ntime convince her who the object of her anxiety might\xa0be.\r\n\r\nBut the distance between them still remained the same, and ended with\r\nthe same disappointing result. A\xa0thought at last crowned her precious\r\nefforts. She fancied if she could succeed in breaking one of the small\r\nwindow panes she could, with the aid of a telescope found in one of the\r\ndrawers, define exactly who the maid might chance to\xa0be.\r\n\r\nThe same hour each day found the eager mistress and anxious maid in\r\ntheir respective places, the former mounted on the window-sill, the\r\nlatter gazing pitifully towards the window of her mistress\'s hateful\r\ncell. But discernment was altogether impossible for Lady Dunfern, who\r\nwas resolved not to be baffled much longer in ascertaining who the\r\nconstant visitor was. Snapping from her finger an exquisite diamond\r\nring, and studying which pane of glass would be least noticed, she\r\narrived at the wise conclusion of extracting the lowest corner pane,\r\nwhich she cleverly and effectually succeeded in doing. Wondering, first\r\nof all, how she would hide the opening from the cute eye of her who\r\nproved her only visitor, she placed her fleecy wrap carelessly against\r\nit, and resuming her seat, was persuaded fully to believe she had\r\nsuccessfully accomplished the first step to her freedom.\r\n\r\nRachel, arriving now with luncheon, failed to notice, or if noticed, to\r\nmention the article in the window. Next day, with great confidence, Lady\r\nDunfern was found in her usual recess, and drawing forth the telescope,\r\nviewed keenly the object of her constant search, and to her wild delight\r\nshe at once beheld Marjory Mason with grave face staring, she fancied,\r\nat her. At last, her Ladyship had achieved a mighty work, indeed, which\r\nshe hoped would yet prove of more practical importance.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned that Marjory Mason visited the same plot of ground\r\nat the same hour every available morning since she was robbed of the\r\npleasure of waiting on her mistress, merely to get a glimpse of the\r\nwindow she knew must belong to her Ladyship\'s haunt of hardship; and\r\ncould honest Marjory have only seen the handkerchief that every day was\r\npointed to its little transparent enclosures, how she would so gladly\r\nhave waved hers in return. But other means had to be resorted to,\r\nthrough Lady Dunfern\'s great perspicacity, to try and establish a line\r\nof communication with one she could trust. This being now arrived at\r\ncast a world of grief from the mind of her who, under such a roof of\r\nsuspense as that beneath which she existed, felt if aid were not\r\nforthcoming, she would shortly have to yield to the imperative command\r\nof the King of Conquering Divines.\r\n\r\nWho could now recognise the "Southern Beauty" of Dilworth Castle?\r\nWho could visit the once beautiful bride of Dunfern Mansion without\r\nnaturally betraying signs of heartfelt sorrow? She who so often graced\r\nthe assemblies of the proud and famous; she who adorned society with her\r\nmajestic presence; she who, by her charming manner and elegant bearing,\r\nfailed not to steal the affection of him who treated her so, was an\r\nobject of abject commiseration where her conduct wasn\'t questioned. She\r\nwas no longer the cheerful associate, the bright converser, the lively,\r\nrobust Irene Iddesleigh. She, the pride of her guardians, the once\r\nadored of her husband, the envied object of socialism, must bear to\r\nexist, though by any means within her power, not where she existed\r\npresently. The next part to be enacted was to attract Marjory\'s\r\nattention. This could easily be tried, and tying her cambric square\r\nfirmly round the top of a small poker, she timidly sent it through the\r\ncavity, at the same time viewing Marjory by means of her telescope.\r\nAt first Marjory was seen to shade her eyes with her hand, and move a\r\nlittle forward, then suddenly stop. She would again move slightly nearer\r\nto the wafting emblem of despair, and quickly advancing, until she\r\nneared the spot where best the snowy sign could be seen, instantly\r\nconcluded that she must be observed by her ladyship.\r\n\r\nWhen Lady Dunfern perceived that Marjory could by no means be closer to\r\nher, she pulled the flag of victory back, leaving her maid in breathless\r\nconfusion, never for an instant flinching until she might again have an\r\nopportunity of rendering her assistance whom she worshipped.\r\n\r\nIn less than five minutes another signal appeared through the open space\r\nin the form of a small piece of paper, the meaning of which Marjory knew\r\nwell. It appeared to be making its way with wonderful alacrity towards\r\nher, who now was in nervous despair lest she should be detected by her\r\nmaster, or some of the other members of his staff. At last the missive\r\nreached its destination, and, wildly grasping it, Marjory loosed the\r\ncord, that was swiftly drawn back, and plainly written by her mistress\'s\r\nhand were the words, "To Marjory, my trusted maid." Shrieking with\r\ndelight, she pushed the note into her pocket, and, speedily hastening to\r\nthe mansion, entered her own room. Securing the door from within, she\r\ninstantly tore asunder the cover, and read with tearful eyes as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n          "Room No. 10.\r\n\r\n  "Dearest Marjory and Friend,\r\n\r\n  "You at last have proof of the confidence reposed in you by me.\r\n  How I have thought of you since I was severed from you no one\r\n  knows. That you have been aware of my imprisonment I can no longer\r\n  doubt. However, I\xa0shall not presently give you any particulars,\r\n  but beg to say that if you could by any means you thought safe let\r\n  me hear if you have ever received any letters for me from Oscar,\r\n  I\xa0should ever feel grateful and reward you accordingly. My reason\r\n  for such inquiry I shall explain further on. Dear Marjory, keep\r\n  this dark. Might I suggest that you slip a note under my door this\r\n  evening at five o\'clock precisely. This you can do I believe at\r\n  this hour with safety. Trusting you are keeping strong, and hoping\r\n  soon to thank you personally for such secret kindness,\r\n\r\n            "Believe me,\r\n\r\n                "Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                        "IRENE.\r\n\r\n  "To Marjory."\r\n\r\nThis note was ample explanation of the confidence Lady Dunfern had in\r\nher maid. She well knew from previous experience how she could trust\r\nher, and felt assured she was not a victim to misplaced confidence.\r\nMarjory would sooner have suffered death than betray her whom she had\r\nserved so long at Dilworth Castle, and so short a time at Dunfern\r\nMansion, and, carefully folding the note she held in her hand, proceeded\r\nto reply.\r\n\r\nLady Dunfern, at the hour appointed, stood in agony behind the massive\r\ndoor, underneath which she soon felt sure of receiving news that would\r\neither increase or diminish her varied stock of fears. Nor was she\r\ndisappointed. At the very hour referred to, the note appeared. Who could\r\npicture the ecstatic relief of Lady Dunfern as she paced her prison\r\nfloor, whilst carefully scanning the contents of Marjory\'s note. In it\r\nshe stated that her husband received all letters direct, not alone for\r\nhimself, but for all his servants, and delivered them personally to\r\neach, this only happening since she was subject to his cruel treatment.\r\n\r\nLady Dunfern was a little surprised at not receiving through Marjory\r\nsome news of Oscar. But when informed of her husband being the recipient\r\nof all letters, she felt confident his were amongst the many for his\r\ninspection, and would not therefore aid his aspect of matters much.\r\nSafely depositing the prayed-for epistle of Marjory in her drawer, she\r\nseemed to suddenly grow quite cheerful and animated, so much so that\r\nRachel, on entering some short time afterwards, was so struck with the\r\nchange as to acknowledge that her ladyship must surely appreciate the\r\nbook she held in her hand to an extraordinary extent, since it had\r\naltered her demeanour\xa0so.\r\n\r\nCould this attendant only have known the true nature of Lady Dunfern\'s\r\nmuch-changed manner, how, with a conquering air, she would so soon have\r\nconveyed the tidings to Sir John. This, however, was not to be. Lady\r\nDunfern believed that such a line of intercourse as that which she had\r\nso artfully managed with one on whom she could ever place implicit\r\nconfidence, must surely yet be the means of freeing her from the fetters\r\nof a fierce and prejudiced race.\r\n\r\nEvery morning, at the same hour, mistress and maid were at their\r\nrespective posts, the former, with brightened eye, mounted on her\r\nfavourite pedestal of triumphant account and gazing intently on the\r\nobject of rescue; the latter, casting that grave and careworn look in\r\nthe direction of the niched signboard of distress, stood firmly and\r\nfaithfully until she received the watchword of action and warning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTorture trifleth not. It manifests in many instances the deserving\r\ncensure imposed upon its stinging touch. It acts like the poisonous\r\nfangs of the serpent, unless extracted from its burning crypt of\r\nchastisement by hands of wily witchcraft. So frightened did Lady Dunfern\r\nbecome lest the eye of the straggler might chance more than once to\r\ncatch the meaning of Marjory\'s loitering about the grounds immediately\r\nbelow her window, that she deemed it imperative to alter her\r\narrangements, and, acquainting Marjory in the usual way, appointed an\r\nhour that would almost defy matters to be made conspicuous. This change\r\nmade both of them more free to act, and proved a decided success.\r\n\r\nOnly some weeks elapsed since Lady Dunfern\'s first missive reached\r\nMarjory until word was forthcoming from Oscar Otwell. Her heart beat\r\nwildly with joy on reading the following, slipped to her in the usual\r\nway:--\r\n\r\n          "Hedley,\r\n\r\n              Berks.\r\n\r\n  "Dearest Lady Dunfern,\r\n\r\n  "You may well guess my gross astonishment on receipt of your long\r\n  looked-for note, and the dire news it contained. My heart bleeds\r\n  for you, and believe me, no stone shall be left unturned until\r\n  your release from that heathenish cell of woe shall be proclaimed.\r\n  Often have I looked for an answer to my letters from you, but,\r\n  alas! in vain. I\xa0began to be convinced that something must have\r\n  driven your love for me into hate. I\xa0am further surprised that my\r\n  uncle, who purchased Dilworth Estate, and who permanently resides\r\n  at the castle with his wife and daughters, never alluded in any\r\n  way in his letters to me to your retirement as it were from public\r\n  life. His answers to my many questions concerning you he entirely\r\n  evaded, and never having had an opportunity of a personal\r\n  interview with him since I entered Chitworth College,\r\n  I\xa0unfortunately have been debarred from rendering long since the\r\n  aid you now seek.\r\n\r\n  "Your suggestion shall undoubtedly have my prompt attention, and\r\n  I\'ll now say no more, until I rejoice in your freedom.\r\n\r\n          "Ever your loving\r\n\r\n                  "OSCAR."\r\n\r\nThe mind of him who was in full possession of the facts regarding Lady\r\nDunfern\'s present position became perfectly distracted, and on entering\r\nCollege next morning, after receiving her note, was so overcome with\r\ngrief as to cause grave alarm amongst the many students who benefitted\r\nso much by his strenuous efforts to insure success. Doctor O\'Sullivan,\r\nthe eminent President of the College, on seeing Oscar, whom he lately\r\nobserved was labouring under some weight of sorrow, in such a state of\r\ndespair, strongly advised a change of air, at the same time kindly\r\noffering him a substitute for four weeks, at the end of which time, if\r\nhe still found himself unable to resume his tuitions, he would prolong\r\nhis vacation by two weeks. This was the very thing Oscar wanted--absence\r\nfrom duty--and he gladly availed himself of the worthy president\'s\r\ngenerous offer.\r\n\r\nHow Oscar quitted the college on receiving the news which liberated him,\r\nnot only for four weeks, but for ever!--how he sped along to his room in\r\nUpper Joy Street, and there wrote a few words to her who longed for his\r\npresence and aid, wondering how the clever trick, so ably concocted by\r\nLady Dunfern, would be accomplished, or if attempted, would\r\nsucceed!--better leave it to her who had so well managed to even reach\r\nthe length of liberty which marked her heroism already.\r\n\r\nLady Dunfern was busily engaged, during her hours of uninterruption, in\r\nmarking notes, with great caution and clearness, on paper for Marjory\'s\r\nuse; and well guarded and guided must the steps be that should again\r\nlead her into the open field of freedom and health.\r\n\r\nThe heavy rain beat furiously against the darkened window of Lady\r\nDunfern\'s confined and much-detested abode as Rachel approached her with\r\nsupper on the night of 24th December.\r\n\r\nAs the next day brought many touching remembrances with it, Rachel, this\r\niron-willed attendant, spoke in rather soothing strains to her whom more\r\nthan once she tried to betray. Lady Dunfern, being so fully charged with\r\nthoughts edging on her flight, remained in perfect indifference to all\r\nher cunning remarks, never betraying the least outward symptom of the\r\nexcitement that then raged so terribly within her; she was resolved that\r\nno word of any description whatever should be conveyed to him who so\r\neagerly awaited Rachel\'s retracing footsteps outside the cell.\r\n\r\nPrompted strongly by Sir John before entering, Rachel carried with her\r\nmessages of a rather condoling character, to be delivered to her\r\nladyship in such pitiful phrases as to twist from her remarks for the\r\nuse of him who feared that something dreadful was about to happen owing\r\nto a miserable dream he had only a couple of nights before.\r\n\r\nBut Lady Dunfern was too watchful to allow even one word to escape her\r\nlips that might innocently convict her; and steadfastly guarding against\r\nthe tongue of the treacherous maiden, remained in silence. The\r\nevil-intended Rachel lingered around the room fully fifteen minutes,\r\nthus affording Lady Dunfern every opportunity of saying something, but\r\nall of no avail; and angrily snatching up the large silver tray, bounced\r\nout of the room, banging the great door after her, probably in order to\r\nfrighten her mistress, but not a nerve did the rude and audacious act\r\ndisturb.\r\n\r\nTurning the light very low, the confined woman slipped on tip-toe behind\r\nthe defiant door, and heard faint sounds proceed from the adjoining\r\ncorridor, the voices she well knew to be those of both her husband and\r\nRachel. Her heart sank somewhat at the discourse that followed Rachel\'s\r\nrecent visit, lest it might be concerning either herself or Marjory; or,\r\nworse still, she thought, relative to her intended flight within five\r\nhours, which she earnestly implored should not be prevented.\r\n\r\nThe voices, however, after a lengthy conversation, suddenly ceased, and\r\ngently moving to the fire, she sat quietly down to heat her icy limbs,\r\nthat were almost benumbed with cold.\r\n\r\nThe thoughts which she allowed to disturb her anxious mind she found\r\nwere very numerous, the principal one being that of flight, which she\r\ntrusted strenuously should be fully accomplished within the time\r\nspecified. The first hour slipped in, the second moved round too,\r\nlikewise the third; and, gazing in wild despair in the direction of her\r\ndainty-jewelled watch, which she kept suspended from a trivial hook\r\nabove the mantelpiece of richly carved oak, could scarcely refrain from\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nThe smallest hand of her little timekeeper could not fail to show that\r\nthe hour of eleven had just been reached; this was precisely the time\r\nall the household retired, including Sir John, on whose part it was not\r\na case of command, but option.\r\n\r\nOn this particular night the staff of servants was not so fully\r\nrepresented as usual. Marjory Mason had not been amongst the number who\r\nsought sleep, neither was it known by any one whether or not she was in\r\nher own room.\r\n\r\nImmediately adjoining Marjory\'s room was Rachel Hyde\'s, both of which it\r\nwas Marjory\'s duty always to keep in perfect order, thus affording the\r\ngreat friend of Lady Dunfern a daily opportunity of viewing the drawer\r\nin which the great key of her ladyship\'s room was at rest.\r\n\r\nIt was a habit with Rachel to sleep with her bedroom door ajar, by order\r\nof her master, lest a fire might originate during the hours of repose,\r\nor burglars enter and carry with them some valuables of no slight worth\r\nor interest.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o\'clock, an hour before Marjory\'s usual time to retire, she\r\nably feigned a very severe attack of indigestion, and, trying to look as\r\ndejected and sick as she could in consequence, requested that she might\r\nbe permitted to go to her own room for the night; a\xa0request which Rachel\r\nreadily granted, as Marjory and she always travelled by the express\r\ntrain of friendship. Rachel added that she would act in her stead by\r\nclearing her master\'s supper table herself.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Rachel granted Marjory\'s request than she dashed up the\r\nmany and winding steps of ascent until she reached the object of her\r\npremeditated scheme by boldly entering the housekeeper\'s room and taking\r\ntherefrom the choicest treasure it contained--namely, the key which was\r\nso soon to prove the nature of the severe illness she so capitally\r\nassumed.\r\n\r\nRachel, on entering the room in which Sir John sat, was quickly asked\r\nwhere Marjory was; and after satisfying him as to her illness, she\r\nhastily removed the articles used at supper, and repaired to rest. When\r\npassing Marjory\'s door, Rachel tapped lightly, and failing to gain\r\nadmission, called on her to admit her with a cup of hot milk. Still no\r\nreply came from within. Then, slowly turning the handle, she tried to\r\nadmit herself without awaking Marjory, feeling sure that she must be\r\nsound asleep.\r\n\r\nIt was only during her third attempt to seek entrance that she found the\r\ndoor locked. Moving into her own room, she muttered something that did\r\nnot distinctly reach the ear of her who was safely secreted underneath\r\nthe housekeeper\'s bed. Divesting herself of her clothing, Rachel soon\r\nput herself in a position to guarantee slumber. She wrapped herself well\r\nwithin the fleecy folds of nature, and in less than ten minutes was\r\nsafely sailing in the boat of dreamland.\r\n\r\nMarjory, for it was she who lay stretched under the bed of her who never\r\nat any time doubted her word or actions, when fully convinced of\r\nRachel\'s safe retirement, crept along the carpeted floor on hands and\r\nknees, carrying with her the key to victory. Proudly and much agitated\r\ndid Marjory steal her way along the many winding corridors of carpeted\r\ncomfort, until at last she came to the bottom of the ghost-like marble\r\nsteps which led to her mistress; and swiftly running up the icy heights,\r\nuntil reaching the door of danger and blood-thirsty revenge, she, with\r\nthe caution of a murderess, thrust with great and exceptional care the\r\nkey into its much-used opening, and heroically succeeded in gaining\r\nadmittance.\r\n\r\nBehind the door lay Lady Dunfern, as if dead. With great presence of\r\nmind Marjory locked the door from within, struck a match, and tried to\r\nlight the lamp, which had been extinguished not long before; this with\r\ndifficulty she nervously did. Then, turning to her mistress, whose\r\nchanged countenance was a sight Marjory never forgot until her dying\r\nday, she tried every effort to arouse her who so soon was likely to\r\ntrack the path of powerful pursuit. It was fully some minutes until she\r\nsaw the faintest glimpse of animation, and gently raising the shadowy\r\nform in her strong arms, used every means in her power to quickly\r\nprepare her for the most trying part of all.\r\n\r\nAt last Marjory\'s efforts were completely baffled; and knowing it was\r\napproaching the time at which Oscar was to be in readiness at the gate\r\nfarthest away from the mansion, that was seldom or never used, the poor\r\ntrembling girl had now enough to bear. She believed the cup of sorrow\r\nhad been drained to its last dregs; still she hoped on, never giving\r\nplace to the remotest trace of doubt, being fully assured of achieving\r\nthe topmost tier of triumph.\r\n\r\nLady Dunfern had, through pure fear of being caught in her adventure,\r\nstood an hour or so behind the door before Marjory\'s welcome steps were\r\nheard, and momentarily on hearing her trusted maid\'s nimble tread make\r\nsuch rapid strides towards her release was with overjoy so quickly\r\nstricken down, at a time when two-fold energy was most required, that\r\nshe utterly failed to regain the slightest strength; and in this sad\r\nstate her helper found her!\r\n\r\nThe moments were passing more quickly now than Marjory wished, and\r\nbestowing one final look at her ladyship\'s watch so firmly clutched in\r\nher fingers, was about to break down in despair, when she was suddenly\r\naroused by a dash of sandy pebble thrown against the window, which\r\nunmistakably announced the arrival of him who so soon was to shield the\r\nshaken form of her once lovely mistress from the snares of jealousy and\r\nintrigue.\r\n\r\nOscar, who stood at the gate appointed, was very uneasy, no doubt, as\r\nthe hour slowly approached that should make him the recipient of the\r\ntreasure he at first should have honestly secured, and fearing lest the\r\nescape might be detected in time for rescue, he was unable to remain any\r\nlonger where he was. Mounting the iron gate, he soon flung himself over\r\nits speary top, and hurriedly making his way towards Lady Dunfern\'s\r\nwindow, where he perceived the dim light, he announced his arrival in\r\nthe manner described.\r\n\r\nWringing her hands in wild despair, Marjory touchingly prayed for speedy\r\nrelease from such cruel torture, and opening the door for the last time\r\nshe carried her mistress into the corridor, and there deposited her\r\nuntil again locking the giant block of oak, then she lightly tripped\r\ndown the ashen steps, along the corridors, until at last she reached the\r\nopen door of Rachel\'s room. Pausing for a moment lest the housekeeper\r\nmight be awake, she satisfied herself this was not so. She then\r\ncourageously entered and safely deposited the key in the exact spot\r\nwhence she took it, retracing in a wonderfully quiet manner her shaking\r\nfootsteps until arriving to convey her precious charge to a place of\r\nsafety. Clasping Lady Dunfern once more in her arms, she crept down the\r\nchilly steps of fate along the well-padded paths of tapestry, down\r\nnumerous flights of wiry-carpeted stairs, until finally reaching the\r\nlofty hall, where she paused for an instant, being a complete example of\r\nexhaustion, and dreading the least delay, approached the door with\r\nsafety. She then deposited her ladyship on a lounge that lay right\r\nbehind it until she secured the key which from previous observation she\r\nnoted, in case of emergency, hung on a silver hook not eight feet\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nWith the air of a duchess, Marjory dashed open the outer door, at the\r\nleft wing of the building, and, with her liberated load of love, swept\r\nfor ever from its touch. Blowing faintly a whistle she bought for the\r\npurpose, she soon was released of her charge by him who instantly\r\nappeared to shield them both from the breezy blast which bitterly swept\r\nthat night o\'er hill and dale.\r\n\r\nTaking Lady Dunfern in his arms, Oscar paced the broad and pebbled\r\nwalks, speedily arriving at the spot where stood a vehicle in readiness\r\nto convey them to their destiny. Not a word was spoken by Oscar, neither\r\ndid Lady Dunfern betray the slightest symptoms of recovery until safely\r\ndriven to the pretty home Oscar had previously arranged for her rescue,\r\nsome twenty miles distant from Dunfern Mansion.\r\n\r\nIt was situated nearly in the centre of Dilworth Park, and generously\r\nhanded over to Oscar as a conditional gift from his uncle, the Marquis\r\nof Orland, who owned its many acres. Marjory\'s joy at this stage fully\r\nbalanced her previous hours of sorrowful and dangerous adventure. She\r\ncould hardly refrain from tears as she viewed the weary night before\r\nthrough the telescope of trickery. She seemed confident of having\r\nperformed a great and good work by liberating from the pangs of\r\nemotional imprisonment the weak and forlorn, who so soon would have been\r\nordered to separate herself from a closet of chastisement to enter the\r\nhome of joy everlasting, which ever has its door of gladness open to the\r\nring of the repentant and contrite.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Lady Dunfern in the careful charge of Marjory, Oscar\r\nproceeded to handsomely reward his uncle\'s coachman, who drove them so\r\nquickly from Dunfern Mansion to Audley Hall, requesting him at the same\r\ntime to treat the matter with profound silence.\r\n\r\nThe rescued form now opened her eyes, and suddenly a convulsive twitch\r\nshook her feeble frame. Casting her heavily-laden orbs of blinded\r\nbrilliancy around the cosy well-lighted room, had not to be informed by\r\nany one what had happened; she gasped, "Thank Heaven, I\'m safe!"\r\n\r\nOscar, tenderly bidding Lady Dunfern "Good night," instructed Marjory to\r\ncarefully administer to her wants until daybreak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is astounding to view the smallest article through a magnifying\r\nglass; how large and lustrous an atom of silver appears; how fat and\r\nfair the withered finger seems; how monstrously mighty an orange; how\r\nimmeasurably great the football of youth; but these are as nought when\r\nthe naked eye beholds the boulder of barred strength--a mountain of\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nThe usual hour for arousing the inmates of Dunfern Mansion was\r\ndesignated by the ringing of a bell, constructed at the back part of the\r\nbuilding, and connected by means of a wire with the room of the footman,\r\nwhose duty it was to ring fully three minutes every morning at the hour\r\nof seven o\'clock in winter and six in summer.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas morning, only a short time after Lady Dunfern\'s escape was\r\neffected, it rang somewhat later, arousing from sleep all the servants,\r\nwith the exception of Marjory Mason, who failed entirely to put in an\r\nappearance, even when called thrice by Rachel. However, believing that\r\nshe was still fast asleep, Rachel ceased to further call on her until\r\nafter serving her ladyship\'s breakfast.\r\n\r\nOn this festive day the breakfast served in the servants\' spacious hall\r\nwas a sumptuous repast, truly, and required longer time to prepare than\r\nwas customary. This being so, evidently delayed the housekeeper a\r\nconsiderable time in attending to the wants of her mistress, whose\r\nbreakfast was always punctually served at nine o\'clock. This rule was\r\nviolated to the extent of about half an hour on the memorable morning of\r\nLady Dunfern\'s flight.\r\n\r\nSir John breakfasted at fifteen minutes after nine, and looked both\r\ncareworn and sad, intimating to Rachel his inability to sleep the\r\nprevious night. Ordering her to prepare a dainty dish for Lady Dunfern,\r\nhe proceeded to read the daily paper, that had been so customary for\r\nyears. Rachel, hastily executing her master\'s orders, and having all in\r\nreadiness for her mistress, hurried to her room for the key. Sharply\r\ntelling the usual maid to follow her with the tray, she wended her way\r\ntowards the door that twice had been locked since her last visit.\r\nUnlocking it, turning the handle and pushing it open, she took from the\r\nservant the tray, as was her custom, by strict orders of her master,\r\nnever allowing the maid further than the door.\r\n\r\nDepositing it upon the table, she swiftly turned to the door, and\r\nlocking it from within, began to gaze around for Lady Dunfern, who\r\nsometimes breakfasted in bed. Moving in its direction with tray in hand,\r\nno Lady Dunfern appeared! The bed remained unused since she settled it\r\nthe previous day. Wildly shouting with momentary pain, Rachel let fall\r\nthe tray, smashing the china, &c., and thickly spotting the matting in\r\nsome places with its contents. In deep despair she cast one delirious\r\nstare around the room, but all to no effect. Heaven help me! has she\r\nfled? Oh, what!--what shall I do? Thinking that she might have hidden\r\nunder the couch of rest, she threw herself on the floor to try and catch\r\nonly a glance of her hidden form, but was disappointed once more.\r\n\r\nRunning to the door and frantically opening it, she ran to Marjory\'s\r\nroom. Failing to be admitted, she hurried down to acquaint some of the\r\nmen, who attempted to open Marjory\'s door, but all their masculine\r\nefforts to arouse her were futile. What was there left to be done, save\r\nto acquaint Sir John of the matter. Agitated did Rachel enter without\r\nsignifying her approach to her master, who sat in silence. "Oh, sir,"\r\ncried she, drowned in tears, and uttered in broken accents the words,\r\n"Your wife has escaped--she is not in her room!" "What!" gasped Sir\r\nJohn. "It cannot\xa0be!"\r\n\r\nFollowing Rachel to the room of terror he found her information too\r\ntrue. "How on earth has this happened?" asked the horrified husband.\r\n"Had you the key?" he fiercely asked of Rachel. Ever ready to substitute\r\nthe truth with a lie, where the former especially would convict her, she\r\nreplied, with a stamp of her foot, "that it never was out of her drawer\r\nof safe deposit." Thinking probably she may have trifled with the\r\nwindow, Sir John moved forward, and the wrap never being removed, he\r\nthought it had not in any way been tampered with until Rachel espied the\r\ncorner pane. "Ah!" said she, "this is the clue to her cursed craft. This\r\nmust have had something to do with her escape." Then the thought of\r\nMarjory\'s room being still closed to view she fancied might have\r\nsomething also to do with the mysterious and marvellous mark of\r\ningenious intrigue.\r\n\r\nBoth Sir John and Rachel tottered to Marjory\'s door, and demanding it to\r\nbe broken open, Sir John entered to be further astonished at her\r\nabsence, to be sure. On her bed she cannot have lain the previous night,\r\nwhich was proof positive that she was an announced accomplice. But the\r\nmystery had yet to be solved as to the action of their flight. Guilt\r\ntook strong hold on Rachel. She knew the key was always kept in a drawer\r\nin her own room, which drawer was constantly kept locked by her and the\r\nkey hidden inside the little clock that ticked so gently on the\r\nmantel-piece in her room; but on second thought, she was so busily\r\nengaged during the Christmas season that actually she forgot to lock the\r\ndrawer the whole week. Never dreaming that this overlook on her part was\r\nso cleverly taken notice of by her who not alone committed the\r\nruffianous act, but caused all the blame to be thrown on the party in\r\ncharge. The housekeeper, who felt sadly and very much annoyed about the\r\naffair, grasped the whole thing--first, she thought of Marjory\'s\r\nprofessed illness the evening previous, then how she tried her door\r\nbefore going to bed, and in this attempt to enter was unsuccessful, and\r\nthat very morning there was no answer, and, finally, she was missing as\r\nwell as Lady Dunfern. The well-arranged plot pictured itself in a most\r\nvivid manner to her who in one respect, regarding the key\'s safety, was\r\nentirely to blame.\r\n\r\nSir John, summoning all his men, ordered them to go at once and intimate\r\nto the officers of the law the sudden flight of the miscreants, and to\r\ntry and find out their whereabouts; but no trace of them was as yet nigh\r\nat hand.\r\n\r\nThe deceived husband appeared greatly crushed under such a weight of\r\nsorrow, and wondering whether or not they could be found, or if Oscar\r\nOtwell, he who so often wrote to his wife during her period of\r\nimprisonment, had ought to do with her daring adventure, aided by\r\nMarjory Mason! It is no longer an unsolved problem that Oscar Otwell was\r\nfrom first to last the chief irritating item of Sir John Dunfern\'s\r\nunhappiness, and whose supposed underhand communications with Lady\r\nDunfern were the principal features depicted in this escape.\r\n\r\nThese letters of Otwell\'s Sir John still retained, never reaching her\r\nfor whom they were intended. Opening his large Davenport that stood\r\nclose by, he extracted therefrom all the letters of the vaguish tutor,\r\nand coming to the one received lastly, found it bore the address,\r\n"Chitworth College, Hedley, Berks." This was so much information\r\nregarding the rascal who was the sole means of separating Sir John\r\nDunfern and his wife.\r\n\r\nThe husband, paralysed with sorrow, instantly wrote to Doctor\r\nO\'Sullivan, the President of the College, who in youthful years was his\r\nmost intimate acquaintance, and whose name appeared so often in Oscar\'s\r\nletters, making the necessary inquiries relative to one of the teaching\r\nstaff named "Oscar Otwell."\r\n\r\nThis he sealed in an envelope, and walked to the village to post it\r\nhimself. After two days\' rending agony and suspense, he received the\r\nfollowing reply:--\r\n\r\n          "Chitworth College,\r\n\r\n              Berks.\r\n\r\n  "Dear Sir John,\r\n\r\n  "I am very sorry to inform you that, owing to a grave despondency\r\n  which of late troubled Oscar Otwell, one of my able and talented\r\n  assistants, I\xa0was compelled, though reluctantly, to allow him\r\n  either one month\'s leave of absence or six weeks\' if he so\r\n  desired, in order to recruit him somewhat. I\xa0strongly advised him\r\n  to seek a change of air, which I believe he did. I\xa0myself, on\r\n  receipt of your note, visited his lodgings to ascertain from his\r\n  landlady when he was likely to return. She informs me she has\r\n  never heard from him since he left, and cannot give the least\r\n  clue as to his present quarters. She adds that he took all his\r\n  belongings with him.--Trusting you enjoy good health.\r\n\r\n          "Believe me,\r\n\r\n                  "Very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                          "D. O\'SULLIVAN,\r\n\r\n                              Pres."\r\n\r\n"Merciful Father!" exclaimed Sir John, as he finished reading the\r\nPresident\'s note, which he laid on the table. "God strengthen me to bear\r\nthis un-Christian-like calamity. Oh, my son, my son! What disgrace shall\r\nthis not bring upon you, my child, my all!"\r\n\r\nPacing the floor in profound agony, Sir John rang for his housekeeper to\r\nconvey the tidings he had just received. Rachel suspected this\r\nbeforehand, but dare not even hint at such a thing to him, who had\r\nalready enough to bear. Speaking in terms which shewed manifest symptoms\r\nof sorrow, combined with rage and perplexity, he ordered her for ever\r\nfrom his service. "You," said he, "are solely to blame. Of this I am\r\npositively convinced, and through that door march, as I never wish again\r\nto set eyes on such a worthless woman." Here Rachel, who was grievously\r\naffected, passed for ever from the presence of him who dared to be\r\nquestioned.\r\n\r\nNext of all, he ordered the footman, Tom Hepworth, into his room. "You,"\r\nsaid he, "are well aware of my present calamity, and might I ask of you\r\nhow my wife and Marjory Mason effected their escape from below? Had you\r\nnot the hall doors locked and likewise all the others?" Replying in the\r\naffirmative, the footman shook like a poplar, knowing well that instead\r\nof having in his room during the hours of repose all the keys of the\r\nvarious doors which led to the outside, he allowed them to remain where\r\nthey were during the day. "Had you all those keys in your own room at\r\nnight, according to my orders since Lady Dunfern was obliged to be dealt\r\nwith in the manner already described?" demanded Sir John angrily. The\r\nhonest-hearted footman, being trapped, frankly acknowledged he had not.\r\n\r\n"Go, then," said his master "and seek employment elsewhere. You are no\r\nlonger fit to be here. You have neglected to carry out my orders,\r\ntherefore you must go." So saying, the sturdy footman bowed and retired.\r\n\r\nIt no doubt caused Sir John a vast amount of pain to part with two such\r\nhelps as Rachel Hyde and Tom Hepworth; but once he formed a resolution,\r\nnothing save death itself would break\xa0it.\r\n\r\nTerror seized every dependent in the mansion lest Sir John would visit\r\nhis anger on each and all in like manner. However, this was not so,\r\nas Rachel and Tom, being longer in his service than any of the others,\r\ncaused him to intrust them with the chief care of matters of importance\r\nin preference. And when he found out that they had so carelessly\r\ndisobeyed his injunctions, they were then compelled to reap the result.\r\n\r\nTom and Rachel, in less than an hour after their master issued his words\r\nof censure and dismissal, left the beautiful home, of such lengthy\r\nshelter, in which they had shared their help so willingly, to plough the\r\nfield of adventure on which they now might wander.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe affections of youth never die. They live sometimes to lift the\r\ndrooping head, and help to chase sorrow from the heart of the oppressed.\r\nIf fostered unduly they generally prove to be more closely interwoven\r\nthan if retained through honesty alone, and fight the battle of union\r\nwith cannon strength until gained for good or evil.\r\n\r\nAwaking from the deep sleep she so much enjoyed after her troublesome\r\nadventures in the past, Christmas Day seemed wreathed with flowers of\r\nheavenly fragrance for the once fair bride of Dunfern Mansion. She now\r\nfelt free to act as she thought best without undergoing an examination\r\nwhich demanded answers of evasive tact--free from the hovering cloud of\r\ndislike under which she so solemnly moved since her marriage day--free\r\nfrom the wild gaze of that detestable of mortals, Rachel Hyde, who\r\nproved as false as she was foul--free from reposing on the suicidal\r\ncouch of distrust and distress--free from the surveillance of a\r\nso-called philanthropist; and free from the traps of tyrannical power.\r\n\r\nShe had no longer to fear the opening door of creaking custody or\r\ncrushed hopes, and well might she now enjoy her Christmas dinner with\r\nrural relish and savoury zest. She found in Audley Hall every simple and\r\ninexpensive comfort, and rejoiced once more to be under the gentle rule\r\nof him whom she would have died to serve. She seemed now to have reached\r\njoy\'s greatest height, and never hoped that she should again be dashed\r\ninto the dam of denounced riches, where love was an absenter to its\r\nsilvery depth; since she had aspired to and achieved the greatest aim of\r\nher ambition.\r\n\r\nOscar Otwell\'s happiness knew no bounds. The trusted tutor had at last\r\nsecured the only hope he ever wished realised, although gained with\r\ndaring enterprise and false advances. He believed that life at last\r\npossessed some charms for him, viewing matters lightly. But behind the\r\nsilvery rock of fortune there lies a hollow filled with darkened traces\r\nof fate.\r\n\r\nThe love dream of youth had hardly time to be told until the future\r\ndream of wonder and dread was about to be prophesied. A\xa0couple of months\r\nor so after Lady Dunfern took up her residence at Audley Hall found her\r\nmore a dependent than a patroness. She had recently fled from a dungeon,\r\nstill it was not one of either starvation or poverty. Whilst occupying\r\nits darkened midst she never had any cause for complaint regarding food\r\nor attendance, both of which could not possibly have been excelled. It\r\nwas only when staring her lover\'s scanty table fully that thoughts of\r\nany nature, save cruelty, haunted her and caused a sad expression to\r\nappear which before seemed invisible.\r\n\r\nOscar, who had no means whatever of a private nature, soon commenced to\r\nfeel the touch of want as well as Lady Dunfern. He had no situation,\r\nneither had he the means to afford the homeliest fare, and although made\r\nowner of his present habitation, yet it was only conditionally he\r\nobtained it from his uncle. Must not the great love they naturally had\r\nfor each other have been of very superlative strength, since it bade\r\nadieu to boundless wealth on the one hand and a comfortable allowance on\r\nthe other, to face the future with penniless pride!\r\n\r\nAdvertisements were often seen in the leading journals for a situation,\r\nand once the name "Oscar Otwell" appeared below. It was treated with\r\nmuffled silence, so much so that after a month\'s daily appealing to a\r\npraiseworthy public, the result proved a decided failure.\r\n\r\nDid he imagine his conduct in robbing Sir John Dunfern of his youthful\r\nwife would be appreciated by a public band of critics? Did he by his\r\nvarious attempts to enter the minds of the needy ever think to solicit\r\ntheir assistance or gain their confidence by tearing asunder the lawful\r\nbond of superficial union and right, casting it upon the sieve of\r\nshattered shelter to separate the corn of crowded comfort from the chaff\r\nof crafty want?\r\n\r\nOscar Otwell, whose literary abilities were proved beyond doubt, and\r\nwhich were the sole source of his existence, was, by his conduct and\r\ncraving desire, driven into the pit of trifling tenure and allowed to\r\nlie dormant until again aroused in a clime to which he soon must wend\r\nhis wasted way.\r\n\r\nIt was now that the heated passion of youth\'s folly became abated as\r\nOscar was beginning to near his purse\'s wrinkled bottom, and failing in\r\nhis strenuous efforts to secure a tutorship, was smartly made to feel\r\nthat he must visit a land of strangers, where height of ability and\r\ndepth of character were alike unquestioned. It was at this stage, too,\r\nthat Lady Dunfern was made to taste of the dish of fanciful wish in\r\nwhich she often dipped her slender fingers to sprinkle her body of\r\ndishonesty. She got time now to brood over her actions of silly\r\nexecution and hatch them with heated hunger. The orphan, the pampered,\r\nthe honoured was at this period the deluded, the mocked, the hungered.\r\n\r\nThis was only the beginning of what must follow; and where did the blame\r\nattachable rest? But on the shoulders of her who had edged the road of\r\nunreasonable revenge, and stripped herself of the covering of coveted\r\ncost to array herself in linen of loose lore and lengthy wear, and die,\r\nit may be, on the wayside of want.\r\n\r\nThe shaft of poverty still kept striking the inmates of Audley Hall,\r\nuntil forced to withdraw its clumsy blow. There was evidently now plenty\r\nof scope for the talent of the learned Oscar to develop; he must plan\r\nhow to arrive at an idea that would bring to the occupants of his\r\ntemporary home the necessaries of which they stood immediately in need.\r\nFailing in his efforts to gain one step towards relief, Lady Dunfern\r\nadvised the disposal of Audley Hall privately, which, she strongly\r\nhinted to Oscar, was their only path of safety from the door of\r\nstarvation. To this suggestion she succeeded in gaining his consent.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly, acting upon her advice, wrote to Doctor O\'Sullivan,\r\nPresident of Chitworth College, intimating to him his present\r\ncircumstances and intention, and begged of him to use his best efforts\r\nin sending him a purchaser, the sale to be kept strictly private for\r\nreasons which, presently, he felt too delicate to explain.\r\n\r\nIn a week or so after, a gentleman was seen approach the door of Oscar\'s\r\nhome, and making the necessary inquiries regarding the price Oscar meant\r\nto accept for it, offered the sum of one thousand pounds, which,\r\nneedless to say, was gladly accepted.\r\n\r\nThe purchaser was rather an elderly gentleman, with chiselled features,\r\ntall and straight, and seemed to have borne the melting heat of a\r\nfar-off clime to a large extent. He informed Oscar that being a retired\r\narmy pensioner, named Major Iddesleigh, he chose to leave the foreign\r\nland in which he sojourned for upwards of thirty-five years and reside\r\nin his native county, adding that he was a widower, having had two sons,\r\nboth of whom predeceased him, and preferred a home of his own rather\r\nthan take up quarters he could not solely claim.\r\n\r\nHe went on to say he had an only brother, a colonel, who formerly\r\nresided at Flixton, a\xa0quaint little town on the east coast of Kent. He\r\nhad not heard from him for many years, and was resolved on arriving in\r\nEngland to lose no time in finding out his whereabouts, and, much to his\r\ngrave disappointment and vexation, he was informed, whilst staying for a\r\nfew days with President O\'Sullivan, that he and his wife had long since\r\nbeen dead, leaving an only daughter, of whom he was now in earnest\r\npursuit. Oscar\'s deadly countenance during the latter part of Major\r\nIddesleigh\'s remarks filled the mind of the purchaser of Audley Hall\r\nwith thoughts of wonder, and on casting a sharp and penetrating stare at\r\nher who passed as Oscar\'s wife, he was similarly struck with intense awe\r\nat the sudden change that swept over her handsome face.\r\n\r\nHer brain whirled with dire excitement on being at last informed of him\r\nwho for years previous she considered had been a member of the missing\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\n"Great and Merciful Forgiver!" thought Lady Dunfern, "am I at last face\r\nto face with Major Iddesleigh, whose name has been so often the subject\r\nof conversation with both Lord and Lady Dilworth?" Gathering her\r\nthoughts and submitting them to subjection, she tried to subdue her\r\nshattered nerves and lock them under proper restraint, until her uncle\r\nshould safely be out of sight on his way back to the home of the\r\nkind-hearted President of Chitworth College.\r\n\r\nShe had not, however, the slightest thought of making him cognisant of\r\nthe fact that she was the proud and lovely daughter of his brother, the\r\nlate Colonel Iddesleigh--the once-adored wife of the widely respected\r\nand generous owner of Dunfern Estate, and now the tempted tool of\r\nemigration.\r\n\r\nShe prayed in her bewilderment that she might escape unknown to him,\r\nrather than make him aware of the disgrace into which her past conduct\r\nhad unmistakably plunged her. Bidding Oscar and her "Adieu," Major\r\nIddesleigh left what was to be his future home, and returned to Doctor\r\nO\'Sullivan to acquaint him of his purchase.\r\n\r\nBefore he had even reached the College on his way from Audley Hall,\r\nOscar Otwell, Lady Dunfern, and Marjory had booked for New York, on\r\nboard the "Delwyn," and when the worthy President was informed of the\r\npurchase, the dashing waves of Atlantic waters were raising themselves\r\nto a considerable height before the eyes of the fugitives, who nervously\r\npaced the deck of danger in despair and deepest thought of their foul\r\ntransaction and Major Iddesleigh, lest before they reached their destiny\r\nhe would be made possessor of his niece\'s conduct, and, with the warlike\r\nwill of a soldier of strength, follow her, and bring her back to Audley\r\nHall to administer to his many wants and comforts, and bequeath to her\r\nall he possessed.\r\n\r\nNor did Oscar Otwell, whose nerves were reaching their shaky height,\r\nfeel free until safely ensconsed in a trim little cottage on the\r\noutskirts of Dobbs Ferry, some miles distant from the suburbs of New\r\nYork. Oscar\'s first thought, after being quietly settled in his new\r\nhome, was to bind himself for life to be the husband of her who had\r\nrisked so much to bring him the joy he long sought after; and within one\r\nmonth after their safe arrival in New York borders, the pretty little\r\nchurch, situated at the east end of Dobbs Ferry, was the scene of a\r\ncharming group of wealthy sight-seers and warm admirers of the handsome\r\nbride of Oscar Otwell, who had lately regained some of her former\r\nspirits, which enlivened her to a pleasing extent, and manifested signs\r\nof joy where lines of sorrow so lately lived.\r\n\r\nIt was for this celebration that Lady Dunfern arrayed herself in the\r\ngorgeous gown of purest duchesse satin, which bore such a train of past\r\nremembrances. Why its puffs of pearly wealth surrounded her well-formed\r\nfigure on the celebration of her marriage with him who long ago should\r\nhave claimed its shining folds, may be considered mysterious. But in\r\nthis, as well as in many other instances, the busy brain of Marjory\r\nMason was prime mover.\r\n\r\nDuring Lady Dunfern\'s confinement in the mansion over which she unjustly\r\nwas appointed mistress, Sir John Dunfern, never suspecting the maid of\r\nher on whom he was driven to lavish correction, appointed Marjory\r\nmistress of her ladyship\'s wardrobe, and it was during her term of\r\noffice that she stole from its midst the box containing the beautiful\r\nParisian outfit which failed to put in an appearance on Lady Dunfern\'s\r\nprevious wedding-day. This Marjory kept, until safe in the shady cot of\r\ncomfort which encompassed within its wooden walls the trio of adventure.\r\nLady Dunfern resolved that this gown should be kept a prisoner until\r\neither worn with a face of happiness and prided ambition or never worn\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nOn entering the church on the morning of her marriage with Oscar, how\r\nevery eye was turned towards the beautiful woman whose radiant smile\r\ngained the hearts of each and all of its occupants. There she stood\r\nbefore the holy altar with calm resolution and undaunted fear, and her\r\nelegant bearing and manner throughout the trying ceremony were\r\nthoroughly appreciated by the assembly.\r\n\r\nOscar bore slight traces of nervousness throughout the oratorical\r\nordeal, and was rejoiced indeed as he turned to leave the scene of such\r\noutbursts of praise, taking with him her who was to be his coveted\r\npartner for life; her, whose footsteps he so often worshipped in days\r\ngone by; her, who entered into treaty legally with a man she never could\r\nlearn to love; her, whom he now claimed as his own, and for whom he\r\nstumbled over many an awkward and winding stile, until at last his\r\nfootsteps had reached the path of level tread, on which he hoped to\r\ntravel until his journey would be ended to that distant land where\r\nstrife is a stranger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wealthy, the haughty, the noble must alike taste of disappointment.\r\nThey court ideas whilst surrounded with bountiful store to be fostered\r\nand fed with heaven-bordered hopes which nothing save denial could\r\nthwart. The meek, the humble, the poor share equally in its visitation,\r\nand learn not to frown at its unwelcome intrusion while they bear the\r\nload of blighted hopes with unshrinking modesty.\r\n\r\nAt Dunfern Mansion matters seemed at a standstill, since that Christmas\r\nDay which began with such sunshine and ended with such misery. Energy\r\nhad fled from the able-bodied staff of servants who occupied its rooms\r\nof plentiful repast. Each and all of them seemed as if death had entered\r\ntheir midst and snapped from amongst them their sole support.\r\n\r\nWas it because of Rachel Hyde\'s hasty departure? No! They had now no\r\ndomineering inflicter of petticoat power to check their honest actions\r\nor words; no eyes of dreaded terror viewing through spectacles of sin\r\ntheir little faults, and submitting them, in exaggerated form, to the\r\near of him who now lay so dangerously ill; no false face masked in\r\nbrasen mould, nor tongue of touchy cut to divide their friendship.\r\nRachel Hyde, whose word, nay, look, was law, was driven from the\r\npresence of him who too long was blind to her false approaches, and who\r\nalways treated her with more leniency and consideration than she really\r\ndeserved, never again to mount a pinnacle of trust and truth, or share\r\nin the confidence of such a just and true specimen of humanity as Sir\r\nJohn Dunfern. She had been made to reap the crops of cunning falsehood,\r\nsown so oft in the fields of honour and true worth, and pocket the\r\nresult of their flimsy income. She, by her long service of artifice,\r\nhad scattered the seeds of scepticism so thickly around the corners of\r\nharmony, goodwill, and peace as to almost defy their speedy removal; but\r\ntime would swamp their silent growth and supplant in their stead roots\r\nof integrity, justice, and benevolence. She had at last been cast on the\r\nmercy of a world of icy indifference to facts of long standing, and made\r\nto taste of the stagnant waters of pity, which flung their muddy drops\r\nof rancid rascality on the face of dogmatic dread, until crushed beneath\r\ntheir constant clash she yielded her paltry right to Him Whose order\r\nmust never be disobeyed.\r\n\r\nTom Hepworth, whose absence was partly the cause of sorrow within the\r\nbreasts of his fellow-workers in Dunfern Mansion, was much to be pitied;\r\nhe was the very soul of honour, and was highly respected by all who knew\r\nhim. In his presence every care vanished like snow in sunshine; the\r\npitiful look that shot from the eye of the down-trodden in Rachel Hyde\'s\r\npresence was thrown aside when Tom appeared. He acted as a father and\r\nfriend on all occasions where trouble reigned supreme, and never failed\r\nto hear the light laugh of youth proceed from its hidden bed, where it\r\ntoo often reposed untouched.\r\n\r\nTom Hepworth, whose race was nearly run, when leaving Dunfern Mansion\r\ntook refuge in the home of Mrs. Durand, his sister, who lived only a\r\nshort distance from where he had spent more than a third part of his\r\nexistence. A\xa0few months only elapsed whilst under her roof when he was\r\nseized with a fit of apoplexy, terminating in a few hours a life of\r\nusefulness and blameless bearing. The shock of his sudden demise, when\r\nconveyed to his master, whom he revered, brought on a severe attack of\r\nhemorrhage, under which Sir John Dunfern now lay prostrate.\r\n\r\nNot a week passed after Lady Dunfern took up residence at Audley Hall\r\nuntil Sir John was informed of her whereabouts. Had her escape been\r\neffected unknown to Oscar Otwell, it would scarcely have taken such hold\r\non the mind of him who, unfortunately, claimed her as his wife; but to\r\nthink he had again been duped by a rascally pauper tutor was a pill too\r\ndifficult to swallow without being moderately reduced. The troubles that\r\nvisit the just are many, and of these Sir John had ample share. He knew,\r\nwhen too late, that he had jumped the drain of devotion with too much\r\nintensity to gain a worthless reward.\r\n\r\nHe was tempted to invest in the polluted stocks of magnified extension,\r\nand when their banks seemed swollen with rotten gear, gathered too often\r\nfrom the winds of wilful wrong, how the misty dust blinded his sense of\r\nsight and drove him through the field of fashion and feeble effeminacy,\r\nwhich he once never meant to tread, landing him on the slippery rock of\r\nsmutty touch, to wander into its hidden cavities of ancient fame, there\r\nto remain a blinded son of injustice and unparallelled wrong! All these\r\nthoughts seized the blighted protector of the late Colonel Iddesleigh\'s\r\norphan daughter; and being gradually augmented by many others of private\r\nand public importance, rose, like a tumour of superfluous matter, and\r\nburst asunder on receiving the last blow relative to poor old Tom\r\nHepworth.\r\n\r\nSir John in a few weeks gradually grew stronger, until finally he\r\nbaffled his severe illness with Christian bravery, and was again able to\r\nkeep the ball of industry moving in the direction indicated during his\r\nyears of singleness, on which he now looked back, alas! not with sorrow,\r\nbut pride.\r\n\r\nDuring all this trying time, however, it must be admitted there shone\r\none bright star of filial attraction which seemed to shoot its reflected\r\nlines of loving brightness towards him, whose face always beamed with\r\ndelight in return. Yes, his little son Hugh, who had been placed under\r\nthe care of Madam Fulham, since Lady Dunfern, by her conduct, could no\r\nlonger fill the post of mother, had grown to be a bright child, able to\r\ntotter around his nursery toys of cost and variety. He always seemed a\r\ncheerful, intelligent boy, and extremely beautiful, but inclined to be\r\nslightly self-willed, a\xa0trait which developed itself more and more as\r\nyears rolled\xa0on.\r\n\r\nAt the age of six, Sir John, abhorring the advice of his many friends to\r\nprocure for him a tutor, had him sent to Canterbury High School, where\r\nhe remained for a period of five years as boarder, under the careful\r\ncharge of Professor Smeath, a\xa0man of the highest literary attainments,\r\nand whose exemplary training of the many youths placed under his august\r\nrule was so pronounced as to leave no room for doubt in the minds of the\r\nmany parents who intrusted their respective charges to him. Each week\r\nduring this period found Sir John a visitor at Canterbury; he gave every\r\ninstruction necessary to Professor Smeath that would serve to interest\r\nhis son in any way, and strictly prohibited him from allowing any\r\noutsider whatever, male or female, an interview with his boy, always\r\ntreating with dread the wily ways of her who claimed to be once his\r\npartner, and who had brought a shower of everlasting shame upon himself\r\nand child. This order had only to be issued once to the stern professor\r\ncarrying out on all possible occasions any instructions received from\r\nthe parents of the pupils under his control with unflinching and\r\nundeniable reliance.\r\n\r\nDuring these five years of Hugh Dunfern\'s instruction at Canterbury, Sir\r\nJohn was seen to gradually grow careless and despondent. The healthy\r\nglow of youth disappeared daily since domestic affliction entered his\r\nhome, and wrote its living lines of disgust with steady hand on the brow\r\nwhich was now thickly marked with them. He got too much time to meditate\r\non the immediate past, which was considerably augmented by the absence\r\nof his son.\r\n\r\nHe was known to sit for hours at a time in deep and painful thought, and\r\nit was only when aroused by Madam Fulham that he ever cared to stir from\r\nhis much-frequented couch of rest; she whom he appointed housekeeper in\r\nRachel Hyde\'s stead, and who acted as well mother to his little son\r\nuntil removed to school--she extended him every attention, of which he\r\nstood in great need, after his severe attack of illness and trial,\r\nbodily and mentally.\r\n\r\nTime rolled along until his son\'s return from Canterbury, whose very\r\npresence should have healed the gaping wounds his absence inflicted, and\r\nchased away all gloomy cavities from the mind of Sir John. On the day of\r\nHugh\'s home-coming, after five years\' training under Professor Smeath,\r\nwhich should have been a day of gladness and rejoicing throughout\r\nDunfern Mansion, it was only one of sadness for the heart-broken father.\r\n\r\nBouncing into the room with boyish pride, Hugh ran and proudly embraced\r\nhim, who, in return, stood face to face with the very image of her whom\r\nhe could never again own.\r\n\r\nThere were the rounded forehead, the aquiline nose, the hazel eyes, the\r\nnut-brown hair, the ruby lips, the pearly teeth, the dimpled cheeks and\r\ntiny chin of his mother, who probably was grappling at the crumbs of\r\npauperism! However, Sir John manfully tried to hide from his boy the\r\nsource of his grave looks, until some day of revelation would demand\r\ntheir blackened origin to be boldly announced to him who as yet was\r\nsolely ignorant of his mother being alive.\r\n\r\nSix weeks\' holiday passed too quickly, Hugh thought, until he would\r\nanother time be compelled to quit his home of unbounded luxury and enter\r\nChitworth College, Berks, for a further period of instruction, the\r\nlength of which events alone would define.\r\n\r\nAlthough the very name of Chitworth College brought reminiscences of\r\ndislike to him who suffered so much from one of its former staff, yet\r\nthose days had fled, and with them the footsteps of flaming stratagem.\r\n\r\nBeing a personal friend of Professor O\'Sullivan, Sir John preferred his\r\nson to reside with him, and receive under his able control all the\r\nnecessary acquirements devolving upon a son of such a proud and\r\ndistinguished race. The morning at last arrived for Hugh to start on his\r\ncollege career, and, accompanied by his father, was not long in\r\ncompleting the journey.\r\n\r\nThe interview between Sir John and his attached friend, Doctor\r\nO\'Sullivan, was affecting in the extreme, so much so that Hugh, being an\r\nentire stranger to such outbursts of grief, and not being prepared for\r\nsuch sudden emotional and silent greeting as that now witnessed by him,\r\nbegan to feel it impossible to refrain from joining in their sorrow.\r\n\r\nThrowing his youthful arms around his father\'s neck, he sobbed\r\nhysterically, and could only be quieted when his father again appeared\r\ncheerful.\r\n\r\nLeaving his son in charge of Doctor O\'Sullivan, the latter retired from\r\nduty that day, and begged Sir John to remain over-night, adding that he\r\nwould so much like to have a chat with him over matters he had known,\r\nand was persuaded to believe caused heartfelt pity to be secreted where\r\nonce there dwelt heartfelt pride. To this proposal Sir John consented\r\nwillingly, not caring to leave his gentle and much-loved boy so soon\r\nafter such a trying meeting as that which he not alone witnessed between\r\nfriends of old standing, but in which he modestly and sympathetically\r\njoined.\r\n\r\nAll the past gravity which marred Sir John Dunfern\'s mirth and\r\nusefulness, and which he kept attracted to one common centre, crept from\r\nits crazy cell on this evening. So soon as dinner was over the President\r\nand Sir John retired to a room of seclusion, and the intense relief it\r\ngave the trodden and blighted messenger of manhood to at last have a\r\nfriend in whom he could confide no one could half imagine!\r\n\r\nFor fully five hours both sat talking confidentially to each other and\r\nsympathising when necessary, and it was only during this conversation\r\nthat Sir John was first made acquaint either of his wife\'s marriage with\r\nOscar or her present abode, neither of which, in the President\'s\r\nestimation, moved the husband of treachery in its most mischievous form\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nThe news of his wife being Mrs. Otwell, instead of the honourable name\r\nher conduct ordered her to bury, only served to cast for ever the gentle\r\nwords of practical remembrance Sir John had in his last will and\r\ntestament concerning her into an unknown chasm. Until now the forgiving\r\nhusband, the meek adviser, the patient sufferer, the wounded knight,\r\nthe once attached partner, the loving father, and the son of justice,\r\ngratitude, and chastity was ready to share a little of his ransom with\r\nher whom he thought he may have probably wronged by too rigorous\r\npunishment. But President O\'Sullivan, whose well-guided words and\r\nfatherly advice had on this evening so sealed the mind of forgiveness\r\nwith the wax of disinterested intent that Sir John, on his arrival home,\r\nat once sent for his solicitors, Messrs. Hutchinson & Harper, and\r\nordering his will to be produced, demanded there and then that the pen\r\nof persuasion be dipped into the ink of revenge and spread thickly along\r\nthe paragraph of blood-related charity to blank the intolerable words\r\nthat referred to the woman he was now convinced, beyond doubt, had\r\nbraved the bridge of bigamy. Some slight alterations, in consequence,\r\nwere necessary to be made, and these being righted, the will of Sir John\r\nDunfern remained a prisoner until released on the day of execution,\r\nwhich as yet could not possibly be named.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nHark! The bell tolled its death-like strains, faint as the far-off\r\nfatherland, steady as the starlight, and sweet as the scent of the\r\nblooming woodbine. The hour of departure is sure and settled, the loss\r\nis sharply felt, the gain completed, and vigorous attempts to retain\r\nboth are oftentimes multiplying on the exertions of the benefitted.\r\n\r\nDuring all these years of revolution the wheel of action rounded its\r\nroads of revelling, riot, and separation. Shandon Cottage, the little\r\nhouse of Oscar Otwell, where he took up residence when first a visitor\r\nto the land of laudable ingenuity, was a pretty structure, and would\r\ndoubtless have proved a little palace of peace to two such lovers had\r\nthe means been forthcoming to keep the glare of poverty within its bed\r\nof stillness, and prohibit its visitation where least desired.\r\n\r\nOscar, who, during his English career, never was possessor of aught but\r\na slight pittance derived from the sources of his mental labours, and\r\nwho courted the vain idea, on being made the recipient of \xa31,000, which\r\nhe pocketed under false pretences by the underhand sale of Audley Hall,\r\nthat he was a man of wealth for life, and when safely settled in his\r\ntrim little cottage, squandered his trifle in a very short time, leaving\r\nhimself and wife on the mercy of strangers\' sympathy, which more or less\r\npresents an icy aspect to the eye of the needy.\r\n\r\nMarjory Mason, who just spent twelve months under Oscar\'s roof, was\r\nfortunate in securing a husband, whose calling kept her during her short\r\nlifetime aloof from the imaginative pinches of the uncertain future.\r\n\r\nIt was only when Oscar was forced to evade starvation that he deemed it\r\nimperative to accept an appointment in a public school, at the yearly\r\nincome of one thousand dollars, an office he retained until compelled to\r\nresign through courting too great love for the all-powerful monster of\r\nmangled might--Intemperance. After a number of years the partaker of\r\nmaddened love was the imparter of maddened might.\r\n\r\nWith beastly force did Oscar Otwell enter Shandon Cottage on the night\r\nof his open dismissal from Waketown Public School, and arousing from\r\nsleep his wife, with monster oaths inflicted upon her strokes of abuse\r\nwhich time could never efface.\r\n\r\nAh! it was now the actions of youthful frivolity stood before her\r\nmountain high and baffled her sickly retort. It was now she pored over\r\nher journal of events, which seemed a burthen unbearable for such a\r\nfragile frame, and begged the credit side to be for ever closed to her\r\nview, whilst she prayed that the debit be left open until she would\r\nenter therein all her past debts to him whom she deceived, deluded,\r\ndenounced, and despised.\r\n\r\nNext morning mended matters little for Oscar Otwell\'s wife. Still raging\r\nwith drunken horror, he lavished upon her torrents of insinuations,\r\nwhich she found impossible to overlook, and which forced her to take\r\nrefuge in the house of the Reverend Bertram Edgar, near by. This man of\r\ntrue piety, at whose church she had occasionally worshipped, extended\r\nthe refuge she presently implored, and proved instrumental in securing\r\nfor her the position of governess in a nobleman\'s family some miles\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nDisposing of all the household effects, Oscar pocketed their dainty\r\nworth, and left Shandon Cottage in earnest pursuit of his wife,\r\nintending to again return to their native county in England.\r\n\r\nHis various inquiries regarding her whereabouts proved vain as the\r\nvanishing shadow of Venus, and finally, when completely overcome with\r\nsober thoughts of his riotous conduct towards the loving and faithful\r\nobject of his choice, who had risked so much for him, he cursed his very\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nA few weeks found him in utter destitution, without either house or\r\nchattels to illegally dispose of in case of emergency, and line his\r\npockets of pauperism with coin of dishonest stamp and flashing forgery.\r\nUnsuccessful in his worthless attempts to further manifest a standing in\r\nthe literary world, and being driven almost crazy in his eager efforts\r\nto ascertain whither his wife had bent her footsteps, he, in a moment of\r\nmadness, resolved to resign himself to that ever-anxious defender of\r\nSatanic rights who prowls about in ambush until safely securing his prey\r\nwith the crooked claws of callous craft.\r\n\r\nWalking along in the moonlight in the direction of Afton Lake, which\r\nsometimes offers its deep waters too freely to victims of sin and\r\nsuffering, Oscar Otwell resolved to bathe his body of perilous adventure\r\nin its darkened waters of deepest death, never more to face the troubles\r\nand trials of weak man and share them with weaker woman--never again to\r\napproach the wife of his bosom with language of lowest type or lift to\r\nher the hand which he so often had sworn should extend her the aid she\r\nnow must seek.\r\n\r\nArriving at the water\'s edge, Oscar Otwell divested himself of his\r\nscanty attire, and in another moment was struggling in the freezing\r\nelement which soon should shroud his future with robe of blackest doubt.\r\n\r\nDunraven Hall was situated only a mile from Afton Lake, and was\r\ninhabited by the Honourable Eric Eustace, a\xa0nobleman of unbounded\r\nwealth, whose extension of charity was both wide and varied. It was in\r\nthis family that Mrs. Otwell was fortunate enough in securing the\r\nposition before referred to through the instrumentality of her spiritual\r\nadviser.\r\n\r\nOn the night that Oscar Otwell resigned his worldly career, there beat\r\none heart in Dunraven Hall with wild emotion. Mrs. Otwell, retiring to\r\nbed as usual, found sleep had altogether fled, and rising from her\r\nspringy structure of restlessness, dressed herself and paced the bedroom\r\nfloor enveloped in dread. She was convinced something was about to\r\nhappen, and struggling in her great efforts to baffle the fear that\r\nhaunted her night and day lately, she resolved, so soon as daybreak\r\npeeped its cheerful face through her window, to take a walk along the\r\nroad in order to cast her fears upon the highway of forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nWrapping herself in her warmest cloak, she soon was found walking\r\nrapidly along in silence on the road that swept round Afton Lake. She\r\nhad not gone far when people were seen to mount the fence that conducted\r\nthem to the nearest point of its watery expanse, which lay about fifty\r\nperches from the main road.\r\n\r\nCourting her curiosity with nervous fear, she walked along, wondering\r\nwhat had happened to attract such crowds. And finding it rather\r\ndifficult to refrain from making inquiry from some of the gathering, who\r\nby this time had hurriedly been retracing their flighty footsteps from\r\nthe imaginative scene of death, Mrs. Otwell, modestly approaching a\r\nfemale who swiftly hopped over the fence in tears, asked what had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n"Oh, madam," cried the woman, "the clothing of a gentleman was seen\r\nearly this morning as David Gillespie, a\xa0labourer, was engaged at a\r\ndrain hard by. It was neatly folded and deposited on the brink. Surely\r\nsome one must have been demented and drowned himself in Afton Lake.\r\nThe authorities are now on the spot and refuse to mention who the\r\ngentleman\xa0is."\r\n\r\nThanking her for kindly informing her of what she had both seen and\r\nheard, Mrs. Otwell hurried back to Dunraven Hall in nervous\r\nastonishment, and hastily proceeded to her bedroom to prepare herself\r\nfor what soon must follow.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast being shortly afterwards announced, Mrs. Otwell, pale as\r\ndeath, entered the room, and taking her accustomed seat to partake of\r\nit, as best she could. She had scarcely got properly seated ere two\r\nofficers of the law were seen approach Dunraven Hall. Ringing furiously,\r\nthey demanded an interview with the Hon. Eric Eustace.\r\n\r\nSatisfied as to the name of his present governess, they wished to be\r\nallowed to see her, which request was willingly granted. Being told that\r\nmorning by the gardener at Dunraven Hall, who ran to the spot on hearing\r\nthe news, that a lady named Mrs. Otwell permanently resided at the Hall\r\nas governess, the authorities immediately grasped the fact that she\r\nmight be the unfortunate widow, and on putting the usual questions to\r\nher concerning her husband, they were still further convinced as to her\r\nidentity. Drawing from his pocket a parcel containing Oscar\'s card,\r\nphoto, and a letter addressed to Mrs. Oscar Otwell, the officer in\r\ncharge asked her to read it aloud, which she did in a rather trembling\r\nvoice, without betraying such signs of grief as anticipated. The letter\r\nran thus:--\r\n\r\n          "Dobbs\' Ferry,\r\n\r\n              Friday Night,\r\n\r\n                      11 p.m.\r\n\r\n  "Dearest Irene and Wife,--\r\n\r\n  "Should ever this reach your length, I trust you will pardon me\r\n  for the rash act I am about to commit.\r\n\r\n  "Since the morning you left me at Shandon Cottage my sorrow has\r\n  been greater than my present frame of mind can well support. I,\r\n  therefore, have decided on ending my days of starvation by hiding\r\n  for ever beneath the glassy surface of Alton Lake to shield my\r\n  wicked body from further inflicting upon you the wrongs I have\r\n  perpetrated in the past, and for which I am grievously tormented.\r\n\r\n  "Dearest Irene, I hope you, in your past great warmth of devotion\r\n  for me (your poor tutor and husband), will forgive my late\r\n  ungentlemanly conduct in striking you so cowardly on the eve of my\r\n  downfall, and thereby breaking the confidence you reposed in me\r\n  for such a lengthened period of our existence.\r\n\r\n  "From what I know of your noble character, I have every faith in\r\n  your forgiveness, and rest assured, I\xa0never mean to face death\r\n  without imploring you to rectify, if ever in your power, the wrong\r\n  you accomplished, partly at my request, in breaking the holy cord\r\n  of union which bound you during your natural existence to Sir John\r\n  Dunfern, and again uniting it under foul auspices.\r\n\r\n  "Had I been so fortunate as to secure you first of all, my\r\n  conscience, certainly, would at this moment be both clear and\r\n  unclouded. But feeling persuaded I have robbed that nobleman who\r\n  now possibly is pining for separation from a world of shame and\r\n  sorrow underneath the lordly roof of Dunfern Mansion, I\xa0am\r\n  positively convinced, under such dangling dishonour, that never\r\n  more can this world of sin extend to me the comfort I in vain have\r\n  tried to seek.\r\n\r\n  "Awake, then, my beloved, to whom I attach not the slightest\r\n  blame, to a sense of feeling and justice, and go, I\xa0implore of\r\n  you, and cast yourself at the feet of him and beg his forgiveness,\r\n  who loved you with a love unspeakable--who severed nearly all his\r\n  self-indulgence with the instrument of intensity and hesitated not\r\n  to lavish it upon the head of her to whom I offer my last advice.\r\n  Then shall you meet the messenger--death--not with shrinking fear\r\n  (like\xa0me), but daring bravery.\r\n\r\n  "Of your present position or abode I am totally unaware, but,\r\n  dearest wife, I\xa0trust your race of penury is almost run, and that\r\n  your latter years may be crowned with Christian fortitude and\r\n  ease, and freed from the thorny dart of the wicked, in whose grave\r\n  I must soon lie unwept.\r\n\r\n          "Good bye, for ever!\r\n\r\n                  From your affectionate\r\n\r\n                          "OSCAR.\r\n\r\n  "Mrs. Oscar Otwell\r\n\r\n      (Address unknown)."\r\n\r\nFolding the letter, and handing it to the officers, together with\r\nOscar\'s card and photograph--all of which would prove indispensable for\r\ntheir future use--Mrs. Otwell quietly moved again to the breakfast room,\r\nand, strange to say, finished her meal in silence.\r\n\r\nThen turning to him in whose service she was, intimated her intention to\r\nsail for England when the missing body would be recovered, which she\r\nmeant to bury in Greenwood Cemetery. She lingered on in eager\r\nexpectation of casting one final look at her husband, but week after\r\nweek died away without any sign of it being forthcoming, and all hope\r\nbeing fled, Mrs. Otwell resolved to lose no further time in returning to\r\nher home of nativity, in order to obey the last instructions from the\r\nhand of Oscar Otwell, from whom she was reluctantly obliged to part in\r\nthe manner described.\r\n\r\nAnother side the picture of futurity presented for the anxious mother,\r\nand that was to try and obtain an interview with her son, who at this\r\nperiod must be a boy of some fifteen summers. Having everything in\r\nreadiness for her journey to her native land, Mrs. Otwell left Dunraven\r\nHall amidst torrents of sympathy and warm expressions from every member\r\nof the family; and it was when driving past Afton Lake for the last time\r\non her way to the deck of the "Delwyn" that the crushed widow of Oscar\r\nOtwell and legal wife of Sir John Dunfern was made to taste of the\r\nunlimited sorrow of her sad career.\r\n\r\nThere she was, a stranger in a foreign land--an outcast to the society\r\nshe shone so brilliantly amongst during years that were now no more, the\r\nfostered orphan, the adopted daughter of heiressed nothing, the wife of\r\ndevotional distinction, the illegal partner of crutchy poverty, and the\r\npenniless widow of undeniable woe.\r\n\r\nShe was not even granted the ghostly pleasure of viewing her lover\'s\r\nlifeless body, that would have ended her thoughts relative to him, at\r\nleast for a time, but as matters stood encircled in doubt, there was\r\nnothing left save trouble and anxiety for her whose futurity must ever\r\nbe shaded.\r\n\r\nOn approaching the harbour of New York, her attention was attracted by a\r\ntall gentleman standing not many yards distant, and being so long\r\nfamiliar with his appearance, she found the object of attraction to be\r\nno other than Lord Dilworth. Ordering the cabman to a standstill, she\r\npopped her head out in utter astonishment, and shouted in such a strain\r\nas to instantly attract his attention. Alighting with ardent enthusiasm\r\nin the very midst of her troubles, she soon found herself in the arms of\r\nLord Dilworth, who appeared utterly dazed.\r\n\r\n"Protector of Powers? can it be Irene? Lady Dunfern, I mean?" gasped he\r\nin bewilderment. To which she bowed, blinded in tears, and in as few\r\nwords as possible, he related a short narrative concerning both himself\r\nand Lady Dilworth, who had long since been dead. On hearing of the death\r\nof the once noble mistress of Dilworth Castle, Mrs. Otwell seemed as\r\nlifeless as a marble statue, and trying vigorously to regain strength\r\nafter such a sudden shock, she, in a few broken snatches, related her\r\nplotted career; but misery having likewise carpeted Lord Dilworth\'s\r\nfloors of fate so much of late, he consequently did not seem so\r\nastonished as imagined.\r\n\r\nLeaving Mrs. Otwell so far as his time permitted, he pathetically took\r\nhis final farewell, and shortly after was busy pouring over his books in\r\nFranklin Street, office No. 715, where he was employed as a clerk at\r\nfive hundred dollars a year.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the mighty ocean palace was steering firmly against\r\nthe clashing breakers with unobstructed speed, acting as protector and\r\nfriend to all those who entrusted themselves to its unsettled shelter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mighty orb of gladness spreads its divine halo over many a harrowed\r\nhome--it encircles the great expanse of foreign adventure and\r\nhome-hoarded enterprise, and wields its awakening influence against the\r\nburthened boroughs of bigotry and lightened land of liberty to a sense\r\nof gilded surprise.\r\n\r\nThe laurels of separation were twining their oily leaves and speedily\r\nconstructing a crown for the brow of Sir John Dunfern. After returning\r\nfrom Chitworth College, and ordering the last few finishing touches to\r\nbe made in his will, he grew more drooped and heartless every year, and\r\nseemed almost indifferent to life\'s ploughing changes.\r\n\r\nHe felt acutely the information imparted to him by President O\'Sullivan\r\nregarding the wife he now for ever despised, and who unlawfully belonged\r\nto Oscar Otwell. He even felt more severely the effect of such on\r\naccount of his beloved boy, who was steadily endeavouring to increase\r\nhis slight store of knowledge under the watchful eye of the most\r\nscholarly personage of the day.\r\n\r\nHe knew ere long--owing to his present state of health, brought to such\r\na low ebb by the mother of his son--that he would be obliged to open to\r\nHugh the book of nature as it stood past and present, and instruct him\r\nin its disagreeable pages.\r\n\r\nThe thought of opening up the past, with its stains of dissipation,\r\nperhaps acted on the mind of Sir John more severely than the reality.\r\nYet he must brave himself for the trial when opportunity offered, lest\r\nit might be too late.\r\n\r\nThe time for Hugh Dunfern\'s fourth summer vacation was close at hand.\r\nThe boy\'s genial manner, affability, and frankness, gained for him hosts\r\nof friends at Chitworth College, and equally numerous were the sharers\r\nin his sorrow on receiving a telegram a very short time before his\r\nsummer holidays commenced to the effect that his father had taken\r\nsuddenly ill, and asking him to delay as little as he possibly could\r\nduring his journey to Dunfern Mansion, which must commence immediately.\r\n\r\nThe poor, sorrow-stricken boy, who was deeply attached to his father,\r\nwas quite overcome with grief. Bidding "Good bye" to all his college\r\ncompanions, and taking affectionate leave of his masters and President\r\nO\'Sullivan, he left the much-loved seat of learning, never more to\r\ncompete in its classes of clever instruction and high moral\r\nbearing--never again to watch with craving eye the distribution of\r\nletters, and rejoice on observing his father\'s crested envelope being\r\ngently reached him by the President; and no more to share in the many\r\ninnocent games of youth, at some of which he was an unequalled expert.\r\n\r\nThe dull hum of voices in the hall of his home met his anxious ear on\r\nthe eve of his home-coming, and told a tale without further inquiry.\r\nMeeting the three most eminent London physicians--namely, Doctors\r\nKillen, Crombie, and Smiley, in the library, where they held a long\r\nconsultation, Hugh was nerved somewhat before entering the chamber of\r\ndeath with words of truth regarding his father\'s hopeless condition;\r\nand, on moving quietly to his father\'s bed, how the lad of tender years\r\nwas struck with awe at the bleached resemblance of what used to be a\r\nrosy, healthy father!\r\n\r\nPerceiving his son\'s bent and weeping form hang over him with meekest\r\nresignation, Sir John cast aside the bedclothes, and, extending his\r\nhand, caught firm hold of his son\'s. Hugh spoke not a word, by order of\r\nthe doctors, lest his father, who was now bereft of speech, would feel\r\nthe pain of not being able to reply in return.\r\n\r\nThe suffering patient lingered on in this dumb condition for six weeks,\r\nwhen suddenly he regained speech partly, but only for some hours--a\r\ngreat dispensation of the Almighty, no doubt, in answer to the silent\r\nprayers of the invalid. It was first noticed by Madam Fulham, who proved\r\na mighty help to Sir John since his wife\'s flight.\r\n\r\nOn entering the chamber of sickness one morning with a new bottle of\r\nmedicine, sent direct from London, Sir John raised himself slightly on\r\nhis left elbow and made inquiry about his son.\r\n\r\nWith hurried and gladdened step was Madam Fulham seen to glide from the\r\npresence of her master, and hasten to find Hugh, who was noticed to pace\r\nthe topmost corridor in agony.\r\n\r\nOn observing his father had regained speech after his paralytic attack\r\nhad somewhat abated, how great was his son\'s delight! Drawing forth a\r\nchair to the bedside of the august patient, Hugh, quite unprepared,\r\nreceived the awful intelligence of his mother\'s conduct and life from\r\nthe lips of the afflicted, who, in broken accents, related the tale of\r\ntrouble which for years had kept him a prisoner to its influence.\r\n\r\nTaking his son\'s hand in his, Sir John Dunfern, after audibly, yet a\r\nlittle indistinctly, offering up a prayer of thanks to Him Who never\r\noverlooks the words of the just, for His great mercy in again enabling\r\nhim to regain his sense of speech, of which he so lately had been\r\ndeprived, began:--\r\n\r\n"My much-loved and faithful son, I, your father, am now stricken down in\r\nthe middle almost of manhood, and am sensitive to the fact that a short\r\nspace of time--yea, a\xa0short space too--must inevitably elapse until I\r\nshall be ordered from this temporary abode, which now to me seems only a\r\nfloating speck of shelter in the great ocean of time. I\xa0am more than\r\nthankful that recovery of speech has been granted me for many reasons,\r\nwhich, I\xa0fear, my strength cannot permit to be fully explained. However,\r\nmy great wish to acquaint you of my miserable married career shall,\r\nI\xa0trust, not be barred from your knowledge by any further visitation of\r\nKingly Power.\r\n\r\n"You are aware, my son, that this mansion which soon shall own me no\r\nmore has been the scene of my frolicking boyhood, my joyful manhood,\r\nand, I\xa0must now tell you, the undying trouble of a blighted married\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n"Your mother\'s name was Irene Iddesleigh, the orphan daughter,\r\nI\xa0understand, of one Colonel Iddesleigh, of Flixton, in this county. Her\r\nfather and mother both died about the same time, leaving their daughter\r\nabsolutely unprovided for. She was taken to an orphanage at the early\r\nage of three years, and there remained for a period of eight more, when,\r\nthrough the kindness of one Lord Dilworth, of Dilworth Castle, of whose\r\nexistence I have already acquainted you, she was brought under his\r\ncharge, and remained as his adopted daughter until, unfortunately,\r\nI\xa0brought her here as my wife.\r\n\r\n"I cannot help informing you that she was the most beautiful and\r\nprepossessing young lady I ever met, and, on making her acquaintance at\r\na ball given by Lord and Lady Dilworth, at Dilworth Castle, not far\r\ndistant, as you know, I\xa0became so intoxicated with her looks of\r\nrefinement and undoubted beauty that I never regained sobriety until she\r\npromised to become my wife!\r\n\r\n"The beginning of our married career was bright enough, I dare say, for\r\nsome weeks only, when she grew very strange in her manner towards me.\r\nSo remarkably strange, that I was reluctantly compelled to demand an\r\nexplanation. Being satisfied with her false apologies, used as a way out\r\nof her difficulty, I\xa0remained content. She still continued nevertheless\r\nto maintain the same cold indifference towards me until your birth.\r\n\r\n"Knowing that a son was born to me, who, if spared, would still keep up\r\nthe good old name of Dunfern, I\xa0became altogether a foreigner to her\r\npast conduct, and it was only when recovering from her illness, after\r\nyour birth, that I caught hold of the trap of deception she had laid\r\nsince long before our marriage.\r\n\r\n"She was found out to be the idolized of one man named Oscar Otwell, who\r\noccupied the position of tutor to her during her years of adoption; and\r\nnot even did her love in return for him cease when I claimed her as my\r\nlawful wife, but continued, so far as I know, until now!\r\n\r\n"I was therefore obliged through her mal-practices to shut her in from\r\nthe gaze of outsiders, and also from my own. I\xa0chose Room No. 10 of this\r\nbuilding as her confined apartment. You were only a child then of some\r\ntwo months, and, since, I\xa0have never beheld her face, which was false as\r\nit was lovely.\r\n\r\n"My rage was boundless on the day I ordered her into my presence in that\r\nroom, and, labouring under the passion of a jealous husband, I\xa0told her\r\nI would confine her within its walls so long as she existed.\r\n\r\n"Over a year passed along, every month of which I grew more and more\r\nrepentant, until the second Christmas of her seclusion, when I fully\r\nresolved to free her once more; at the same time, never again to share\r\nin my society or companionship.\r\n\r\n"But, behold! the mischievous hand of her maid, Marjory Mason, whose\r\nservices I retained after her imprisonment, was busy working its way for\r\nher escape, which she nimbly succeeded in effecting, exactly on the\r\nmorning of Christmas Day, by stealing from the room of Rachel Hyde,\r\nMadam Fulham\'s predecessor, the key of her door, and thereby released\r\nyour mother. Ah! my son, from that hour my life has been a worthless\r\ncoin, the harp of hideous helplessness struck forth its tunes of\r\nturmoil, trouble, and trial, and poured its mixed strains of life and\r\ndeath so vividly in my ear, that since I have, in a measure, been only a\r\nwanderer between their striking sounds of extremes.\r\n\r\n"I shortly afterwards learned she took refuge in Audley Hall,\r\na\xa0residence on the estate of its present owner--the Marquis of Orland,\r\nand situated some twenty miles distant, and, horrifying to relate, had\r\nbeen living with Oscar Otwell!\r\n\r\n"The dreadful news of her conduct irritated me so that I only, in my\r\nlast will and testament, bequeathed to her what would grant the ordinary\r\ncomforts of life, provided I predeceased her. This reference to her\r\nremained until I accompanied you to Chitworth College, when President\r\nO\'Sullivan revealed to me in silent friendship the fact of which I was\r\nwholly unaware, viz.--that she had long since sailed for America, at the\r\nsame time handing me a _New York Herald_ sent him by Otwell, and there I\r\nbeheld the announcement of her marriage with him who ruined my life, and\r\nwho has been the means of driving me into the pit of tearful tremor, out\r\nof which I never more shall climb.\r\n\r\n"On returning home from Chitworth College I at once blanked the\r\nreference to her in my will, and never more wished to behold the face\r\nthat swore to me such vows of villainy; the face that blasted my\r\nhappiness for life; the mother of you, whom I now earnestly implore\r\nnever to acknowledge, and who possesses every feature she outwardly\r\nbore.\r\n\r\n"It may be yours to meet her face to face ere she leave this tabernacle\r\nof torment; but, my child, for my sake avoid her cunning ways and works,\r\nand never allow her shelter underneath this roof she dishonoured and\r\ndespised. And I trust God in His great mercy shall forgive her errors,\r\nand grant you the blessing of a Father of Love."\r\n\r\nSir John Dunfern now lay back exhausted on his pillow, and muttered\r\nquietly "Thank God."\r\n\r\nNext morning the Angel of Death was seen to spread its snowy wings over\r\nhis wasted form, and convey the departed spirit into that region of\r\nbliss where sorrow, sighing, sin, and suffering are cast for ever from\r\nits rooms of glory.\r\n\r\nThus passed away another link of a worthy ancestral chain, who, during\r\nhis tender years of training, had been guided by the charitable\r\nChristian example of a mother of devotion, and who was, during the\r\nbrighter battle of her son\'s creeping years of care and caution,\r\nsummoned before the Invisible Throne of purity, peace, and praise\r\neverlasting, shrouded in hopes of sunshine concerning his future\r\nhappiness, which, never after his marriage, was known to twinkle in\r\nDunfern Mansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMocking Angel! The trials of a tortured throng are naught when weighed\r\nin the balance of future anticipations. The living sometimes learn the\r\ntouchy tricks of the traitor, the tardy, and the tempted; the dead have\r\nevaded the flighty earthly future, and form to swell the retinue of\r\nretired rights, the righteous school of the invisible, and the\r\nrebellious roar of raging nothing.\r\n\r\nThe night was dark and tempestuous; the hill rather inclined to be\r\nsteep; the clouds were bathed in wrinkled furrows of vapoury smoke; the\r\ntraffic on the quiet and lonely roads surrounding Dunfern Mansion was\r\nutterly stopped, and nature seemed a block of obstruction to the eye of\r\nthe foreigner who drudged so wearily up the slope that led to the home\r\nof Mrs. Durand, who had been confined to bed for the past three years,\r\na\xa0sufferer from rheumatism.\r\n\r\nPerceiving the faint flicker of light that occasionally flung its feeble\r\nrays against the dim fanlight of faithful Fanny\'s home--the aged sister\r\nof the late Tom Hepworth--the two-fold widowed wanderer, with trembling\r\nstep, faltered to the door of uncertain refuge, and, tapping against it\r\nwith fingers cold and stiff, on such a night of howling wind and beating\r\nrain, asked, in weakened accents, the woman who opened to her the door,\r\n"If she could be allowed to remain for the night?"--a request that was\r\ngranted through charity alone. After relieving herself of some outer\r\ngarments, and partaking of the slight homely fare kindly ordered by Mrs.\r\nDurand, the widow of Oscar Otwell and Sir John Dunfern warmed herself\r\nand dried her saturated clothing before going to bed. She had just\r\narrived the day previous, and hastened to take up her abode as near her\r\nformer home of exquisiteness as she could, without detection.\r\n\r\nOn extinguishing the light before retiring, and casting one glance in\r\nthe direction of the little window, the innumerable recollections of the\r\nabundant past swept across the mind of the snowy-haired widow, and were\r\nfurther augmented by the different starlike lights which shone from the\r\nnumerous windows in Dunfern Mansion, directly opposite where she lay.\r\n\r\nA couple of days found her almost rested after such a trying night as\r\nthat on which she arrived, and observing the sharpest reticence lest she\r\nmight be known, she nerved herself to appear next day at Dunfern\r\nMansion, to accomplish the last wish of her late lover and husband, for\r\nwhom she ventured so much and gained so little, and particularly to try\r\nand see her son.\r\n\r\nThe morning was warm and fine; numerous birds kept chirping outside the\r\nlittle cottage of Mrs. Durand. The widow, with swollen eyes and face of\r\nfaded fear, prepared herself for the trying moment, which she was\r\ncertain of achieving. Partaking of a very slight breakfast, she told\r\nMrs. Durand not to expect her for dinner.\r\n\r\nMarching down the hill\'s face, she soon set foot on the main road that\r\nled direct to Dunfern Mansion. Being admitted by Nancy Bennet, a\xa0prim\r\nold dame, who had been in charge of the lodge for the last eighteen\r\nyears, the forlorn widow, whose heart sank in despair as she slowly\r\nwalked up the great and winding avenue she once claimed, reached the\r\nhuge door through which she had been unconsciously carried by Marjory\r\nMason a good many years ago.\r\n\r\nGently ringing the bell, the door was attended by a strange face.\r\nReverently asking to have an interview with Sir John Dunfern, how the\r\ndeath-like glare fell over the eyes of the disappointed as the footman\r\ninformed her of his demise! "Madam, if you cast your eyes thence--[here\r\nthe sturdy footman pointed to the family graveyard, lying quite\r\nadjacent, and in which the offcast of effrontery had oftentimes\r\ntrodden]--you can with ease behold the rising symbol of death which the\r\nyoung nobleman, Sir Hugh Dunfern, has lavishly and unscrupulously\r\nerected to his fond memory."\r\n\r\nThe crushed hopes of an interview with the man she brought with head of\r\nbowed and battered bruises, of blasted untruths and astounding actions,\r\nto a grave of premature solitude were further crumbled to atoms in an\r\ninstant. They were driven beyond retention, never again to be fostered\r\nwith feverish fancy. After the deplorable news of her rightful husband\'s\r\ndeath had been conveyed to the sly and shameless questioner, who tried\r\nhard to balance her faintish frame unobserved, she asked an interview\r\nwith Sir Hugh Dunfern. This also was denied, on the ground of absence\r\nfrom home.\r\n\r\nHeavily laden with the garb of disappointment did the wandering woman of\r\nwayward wrong retrace her footsteps from the door for ever, and\r\nleisurely walked down the artistic avenue of carpeted care, never more\r\nto face the furrowed frowns of friends who, in years gone by, bestowed\r\non her the praises of poetic powers. Forgetful almost of her present\r\nmovements, the dangerous signal of widowhood was seen to float along the\r\nfamily graveyard of the Dunferns.\r\n\r\nBeing beforehand acquaint with the numerous and costly tombstones\r\nerected individually, regardless of price, the wearied and sickly woman\r\nof former healthy tread was not long in observing the latest tablet, of\r\ntowering height, at the north-east end of the sacred plot.\r\n\r\nThere seemed a touchy stream of gilded letters carefully cut on its\r\nmarble face, and on reading them with watery eye and stooping form, was\r\nit anything remarkable that a flood of tears bathed the verdure that\r\npeeped above the soil?\r\n\r\nThe lines were these:--\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n  The hand of death hath once more brought\r\n    The lifeless body here to lie,\r\n  Until aroused with angels\' voice,\r\n    Which call it forth, no more to die.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n  This man, of health and honest mind,\r\n    Had troubles great to bear whilst here,\r\n  Which cut him off, in manhood\'s bloom,\r\n    To where there\'s neither frown nor tear.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n  His life was lined with works of good\r\n    For all who sought his affluent aid;\r\n  His life-long acts of charity\r\n    Are sure to never pass unpaid.\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n  Sir John Dunfern, whose noble name\r\n    Is heard to echo, far and wide,\r\n  In homes of honour, truth, and right,\r\n    With which he here lies side by side.\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n  The wings of love and lasting strength\r\n    Shall flap above his hollow bed;\r\n  Angelic sounds of sweetest strain\r\n    Have chased away all tears he shed.\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n  Then, when the glorious morn shall wake\r\n    Each member in this dust of ours,\r\n  To give to each the sentence sure\r\n    Of everlasting Princely Power--\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n  He shall not fail to gain a seat\r\n    Upon the bench of gloried right,\r\n  To don the crown of golden worth\r\n    Secured whilst braving Nature\'s fight.\r\n\r\nAfter carefully reading these lines the figure of melting woe sat for a\r\nlong time in silence until a footstep came up from behind, which alarmed\r\nher not a little. Looking up she beheld the face of a youth whose\r\nexpression was very mournful, and asking after her mission, was informed\r\nshe had been casting one last look on the monument of her lamented\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n"Mighty Heavens!" exclaimed Sir Hugh Dunfern, "are you the vagrant who\r\nruined the very existence of him whom you now profess to have loved?\r\nYou, the wretch of wicked and wilful treachery, and formerly the wife of\r\nhim before whose very bones you falsely kneel! Are you the confirmed\r\ntraitoress of the trust reposed in you by my late lamented, dearest, and\r\nmost noble of fathers? Are you aware that the hypocrisy you manifested\r\nonce has been handed down to me as an heirloom of polluted possession,\r\nand stored within this breast of mine, an indelible stain for life, or,\r\nI\xa0might say, during your known and hated existence?\r\n\r\n"False woman! Wicked wife! Detested mother! Bereft widow!\r\n\r\n"How darest thou set foot on the premises your chastity should have\r\nprotected and secured! What wind of transparent touch must have blown\r\nits blasts of boldest bravery around your poisoned person and guided you\r\nwithin miles of the mansion I proudly own?\r\n\r\n"What spirit but that of evil used its influence upon you to dare to\r\nbend your footsteps of foreign tread towards the door through which they\r\nonce stole unknown? Ah, woman of sin and stray companion of tutorism,\r\narise, I\xa0demand you, and strike across that grassy centre as quickly as\r\nyou can, and never more make your hated face appear within these mighty\r\nwalls. I\xa0can never own you; I\xa0can never call you mother; I\xa0cannot extend\r\nthe assistance your poor, poverty-stricken attire of false don silently\r\nrequests; neither can I ever meet you on this side the grave, before\r\nwhich you so pityingly kneel!"\r\n\r\nSpeechless and dogged did the dishonoured mother steal for ever from the\r\npresence of her son, but not before bestowing one final look at the\r\nbrightened eye and angry countenance of him who loaded on her his lordly\r\nabuse. The bowed form of former stateliness left for ever the grounds\r\nshe might have owned without even daring to offer one word of repentance\r\nor explanation to her son.\r\n\r\nWalking leisurely along the road that reached Dilworth Castle, how the\r\ntrying moments told upon her who shared in pangs of insult and\r\npoverty!--how the thoughts of pleasant days piled themselves with\r\nparched power upon the hilltop of remembrance and died away in the\r\ndistance! The whirling brain became more staid as she heard the approach\r\nof horses\' feet, and stopping to act the part of Lot\'s wife, gave such a\r\nhaggard stare at the driver of the vehicle as caused him to make a\r\nsudden halt. Asking her to have a seat, the weary woman gladly mounted\r\nupon its cushion with thankfulness, and alighted on reaching its\r\njourney\'s end, about three miles from Audley Hall. The drive was a long\r\none, and helped to rest the tired body of temptation.\r\n\r\nReturning thanks to the obliging driver, she marched wearily along until\r\nshe reached the home of her first refuge after flight.\r\n\r\nPerceiving the yellow shutters firmly bolted against the light admitters\r\nof Audley Hall, she feared disappointment was also awaiting her.\r\nKnocking loudly twice before any attempt was made to open the door,\r\nthere came at last an aged man with halting step and shaking limb.\r\n\r\n"Is Major Iddesleigh at home?" asked the saddened widow. "Oh, madam, he\r\nhas been dead almost twelve years, and since then no one has occupied\r\nthis Hall save myself, who am caretaker. The Marquis of Orland was\r\ndeceived by his nephew, who sold it in an underhand manner to the major,\r\nand he resolved that never again would he allow it to be occupied since\r\nthe major\'s death by any outsider."\r\n\r\n"You are rather lonely," said the widow. "Yes, yes," replied he; "but I\r\nhave always been accustomed living alone, being an old bachelor, and\r\nwish to remain so. It is better to live a life of singleness than\r\ntorture both body and soul by marrying a woman who doesn\'t love you,\r\nlike the good Sir John Dunfern--a nobleman who lived only some miles\r\nfrom this, and who died lately broken-hearted--who became so infatuated\r\nwith an upstart of unknown parentage, who lived in Dilworth Castle, with\r\none Lord Dilworth, the previous owner, that he married her offhand, and,\r\nwhat was the result, my good woman?--why she eventually ran off with a\r\npoor tutor! and brought the hairs of hoary whiteness of Sir John Dunfern\r\nto the grave much sooner than in all probability they would have, had he\r\nremained like\xa0me."\r\n\r\nFacing fumes of insult again, thought the listener. And asking after\r\nMajor Iddesleigh\'s will, eagerly awaited his reply.\r\n\r\nPlacing one hand upon her shoulder, and pointing with the other,\r\n"Behold," said he, "yonder church? that was his last will--Iddesleigh\r\nChurch. It was only when the jaws of death gaped for their prey that the\r\nmajor was forced to alter his will, having had it previously prepared in\r\nfavour of his niece, whose whereabouts could never be traced until after\r\nhis death." "Enough--enough, I\xa0must go," said the painful listener, and\r\nthanking the old man for his information, which, like her son\'s, had\r\nscrewed its bolts of deadly weight more deeply down on the lid of\r\nabstract need, turned her back on Audley Hall for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nHope sinks a world of imagination. It in almost every instance never\r\nfails to arm the opponents of justice with weapons of friendly defence,\r\nand gains their final fight with peaceful submission. Life is too often\r\nstripped of its pleasantness by the steps of false assumption, marring\r\nthe true path of life-long happiness which should be pebbled with\r\nprinciple, piety, purity, and peace.\r\n\r\nNext morning, after the trying adventure of the lonely outcast, was the\r\nscene of wonder at Dilworth Castle. Henry Hawkes, the head gardener\r\nunder the Marquis of Orland, on approaching the little summer-house in\r\nwhich Irene Iddesleigh so often sat in days of youth, was horrified to\r\nfind the dead body of a woman, apparently a widow, lying prostrate\r\ninside its mossy walls. "Lord, protect me!" shouted poor Hawkes, half\r\ndistractedly, and hurried to Dilworth Castle to inform the inmates of\r\nwhat he had just seen.\r\n\r\nThey all rushed towards the little rustic building to verify the\r\ncertainty of the gardener\'s remarks. There she lay, cold, stiff, and\r\nlifeless as Nero, and must have been dead for hours. They advised the\r\nauthorities, who were soon on the spot.\r\n\r\nWhat stinging looks of shame the Marquis cast upon her corpse on being\r\ntold that it was that of the once beautiful Lady Dunfern--mother of the\r\npresent heir to Dunfern estate!\r\n\r\nLying close at hand was an old and soiled card, with the words almost\r\nbeyond distinction, "Irene Iddesleigh." In an instant her whole history\r\nflashed before the unforgiving mind of the Marquis, and being a sharer\r\nin her devices, through his nephew Oscar Otwell, ordered her body to be\r\nconveyed to the morgue, at the same time intimating to Sir Hugh Dunfern\r\nher demise.\r\n\r\nIt transpired at the inquest, held next day, that she was admitted the\r\nprevious night to the grounds of Dilworth Castle by the porter at the\r\nlodge, giving her name as "Irene Iddesleigh."\r\n\r\nShe must have taken refuge in the little construction planned under her\r\npersonal supervision whilst inhabiting Dilworth Castle during her\r\ngirlhood, and, haunted with the never-dying desire to visit once more\r\nits lovely grounds, wandered there to die of starvation.\r\n\r\nNo notice whatever was taken of her death by her son, who obeyed to the\r\nlast letter his father\'s instructions, and carried them out with\r\ntearless pride.\r\n\r\nThe little narrow bed at the lowest corner on the west side of Seaforde\r\ngraveyard was the spot chosen for her remains. Thus were laid to rest\r\nthe orphan of Colonel Iddesleigh, the adopted daughter and imagined\r\nheiress of Lord and Lady Dilworth, what might have been the proud wife\r\nof Sir John Dunfern, the unlawful wife of Oscar Otwell, the suicidal\r\noutcast, and the despised and rejected mother.\r\n\r\nShe who might have swayed society\'s circle with the sceptre of\r\nnobleness--she who might still have shared in the greatness of her\r\nposition and defied the crooked stream of poverty in which she so long\r\nsailed--had she only been, first of all, true to self, then the\r\nhonourable name of Sir John Dunfern would have maintained its standard\r\nof pure and noble distinction, without being spotted here and there with\r\nheathenish remarks inflicted by a sarcastic public on the administerer\r\nof proper punishment; then the dignified knight of proud and upright\r\nancestry would have been spared the pains of incessant insult, the\r\nmockery of equals, the haunted diseases of mental trials, the erring eye\r\nof harshness, and the throbbing twitch of constant criticism.\r\n\r\nIt was only the lapse of a few minutes after the widowed waif left\r\nDunfern Mansion until the arrival of her son from London, who, after\r\nbidding his mother quit the grounds owned by him, blotted her name for\r\never from his book of memory; and being strongly prejudiced by a father\r\nof faultless bearing, resolved that the sharers of beauty, youth, and\r\nfalse love should never have the slightest catch on his affections.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe End\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n           *       *       *       *\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Errors and Inconsistencies_\r\n\r\nThe printed book was typeset and proofread more carefully than most\r\nbooks of similar literary quality.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
