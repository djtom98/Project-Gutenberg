But it isn\'t, and in fact it is much more of an adult\'s book\r\nthan a child\'s.\r\n\r\nOld squire Roger Ingleton dies in the first few pages of the book, and\r\nwe are left with two more Roger Ingletons.  The first of these had had a\r\nrow with his family twenty years before, had stormed out, had then led a\r\ndissipated life, and finally had been reported dead somewhere in India.\r\n\r\nThe third one is the eponymous hero of the book.  He is handed a sealed\r\nenvelope left by his deceased father, and in it the father says that he\r\nis not at all sure that the older son is really dead.  So young Roger\r\ngoes looking for his older brother, who will of course then inherit all\r\nthe property.  Honest and generous, we must say!\r\n\r\nThe book takes us through all sorts of twists, and is really very good\r\nvalue.  We recommend that you read it or listen to it, as it is well\r\nworth the trouble.

Though it had been falling\r\nscarcely an hour, it had already transfigured the dull old place from a\r\ngloomy pile of black and grey into a gleaming vision of white.  It\r\nlodged in deep piles in the angles of the rugged gables, and swirled up\r\nin heavy drifts against the hall-door.  It sat heavily on the broad ivy-\r\nleaves over the porch, and blotted out lawn, path, and flowerbed in a\r\nuniversal pall of white velvet.  The wind-flattened oaks in the park\r\nwere become tables of snow; and away over the down, to the edge of the\r\ncliff itself, the dazzling canopy stretched, making the gulls as they\r\nskimmed its surface in troubled flight appear dingy, and the uneasy\r\nocean beyond more than ever grey and leaden.\r\n\r\nAnd the snow was falling still, and promised to make a night of it.  At\r\nleast so thought one of the inmates of the manor-house as he got up from\r\nhis music-stool and casually looked out of the fast-darkening window,\r\nthanking his stars that it mattered little to him, in his cosy bachelor-\r\nden, whether it went on a night or a fortnight.  This complacent\r\nindividual was a man at whom one would be disposed to look twice before\r\ncoming to any definite conclusion respecting him.  At the first glance\r\nyou might put him down for twenty-five; at the second, you would wonder\r\nwhether you had possibly made a slight miscalculation of twenty years.\r\nHis keen eyes, his smooth face, his athletic figure, his somewhat\r\ndandified dress were all in favour of the young man.  The double line\r\nacross his brow, the enigmas about his lips, the imperturbable gravity\r\nof his features bespoke the elder.  Handsome he was not--he was hardly\r\ngood-looking, and the nervous twitch of his eyebrow as it came down over\r\nhis single eye-glass constantly disfigured him.  What was his temper,\r\nhis character, his soul, you might sit for a month before him and never\r\ndiscover.  But from his deep massive chest, his long arms, his lithe\r\nstep, and the poise of his head upon his broad shoulders, you would\r\nprobably conclude that his enemy, if he had one, would do well not to\r\nfrequent the same dark lane as Mr Frank Armstrong.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon, as he draws his curtain and lights his lamp, he is\r\npassably content with himself and the world; for he has just discovered\r\na new volume of Schumann that takes his fancy.  He has no quarrel,\r\ntherefore, with the snow, except that by its sudden arrival it will\r\nprobably hold his promising pupil, Master Roger, prisoner for the night\r\nat Castleridge, where he and his mother have driven for dinner.  The\r\ntutor has sufficient interest in his work to make him regret this\r\ninterruption of his duties, but for the present he will console himself\r\nwith Schumann.  So he returns to his music-stool--the one spot in\r\ncreation where he allows that he can be really happy--and loses himself\r\nin a maze of sweet sound.\r\n\r\nSo engrossed is he in his congenial occupation, that he is quite unaware\r\nof the door behind him opening and a voice saying--\r\n\r\n"Beg pardon, sir, but the master wants you."\r\n\r\nRaffles, the page-boy, who happened to be the messenger, was obliged to\r\ndeliver his summons three times--the last time with the accompaniment of\r\na tap on the tutor\'s shoulder--before that _virtuoso_ swung round on his\r\nstool and demanded--\r\n\r\n"What is it, Raffles?"\r\n\r\n"Please, sir, the master wants you hinstanter."\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong was inclined to compliment Raffles on his Latin, but on\r\nsecond thoughts (the tutor\'s second thoughts murdered a great number of\r\nhis good sayings) he considered that neither the page nor himself would\r\nbe much better for the jest, and spared himself.\r\n\r\nHe nodded to the messenger to go, and closing the piano, screwed his\r\neye-glass in his eye, ready to depart.\r\n\r\n"Please, sir," said Raffles at the door, "the governor he\'s dicky to-\r\nday.  You\'d best have your heye on \'im."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Raffles; I will," said the tutor, going out.\r\n\r\nHe paced the long passage which led from his quarters to the oak hall,\r\nwhistling _sotto voce_ a bar or two of the Schumann as he went; then his\r\nmanner became sombre as he crossed the polished boards and entered the\r\npassage beyond which led to his employer\'s library.\r\n\r\nOld Roger Ingleton was sitting in the almost dark room, staring fixedly\r\ninto the fire.  There was little light except that of the flickering\r\nembers in his dim, worn face.  Though not yet seventy, his spare form\r\nwas bent into the body of an old, old man, and the hands, which feebly\r\ntapped the arms of the chair on which they rested, were the worn-out\r\nmembers of a man long past his work.  He saw little and heard less; nor\r\nwas he ever to be met outside the confines of his library, or, in summer\r\nweather, the sunny balcony on to which it opened.  Only when he talked\r\nwere you able to realise that this worn-out body did not belong to a\r\nTithonus, but to a man whose inward faculties were still alert and\r\nvigorous, whatever might be said of his outward failure.  Could he but\r\nhave been accommodated with the physical frame of a man of fifty, he had\r\nspirit enough to fill it, and become once more what he was twenty years\r\nago, a complete man.\r\n\r\n"Sit down, Armstrong," said he, when presently his dim eyes and ears\r\nbecame aware of the tutor\'s presence.  "There\'s no need to light the\r\nlamp, and you need not trouble to talk, for I should not be able to hear\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nThe tutor shook the eye-glass out of his eye, and seated himself at a\r\ncorner of the hearth in silence.\r\n\r\nMr Ingleton, having thus prepared his audience, looked silently into\r\nthe fire for another half-hour, until the room was dark, and all the\r\ntutor could see was a wan hand fidgeting uneasily on the arm of the\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nThen with a weary effort the Squire turned his head and began, as if\r\ncontinuing a conversation.\r\n\r\n"I have not been unobservant, Armstrong.  You came at a time when Roger\r\nneeded a friend.  So far you have done well by him, and I am content\r\nwith my choice of a tutor.  What contents me more is to think you are\r\nnot yet tired of your charge.  I rather envy you, Armstrong.  I came to\r\ngrief where you succeeded.  I once flattered myself I could bring up a\r\nboy--he happened to be my son, too--but--"\r\n\r\nHere the old man resumed his gaze into the fire, and the room was as\r\nsilent as the grave for a quarter of an hour.  The tutor began to be\r\nuneasy.  Perhaps he had yearnings for his piano and Schumann.  For all\r\nthat, he sat like a statue and waited.  At last the Squire moved again.\r\n\r\n"I dreaded a repetition of that, Armstrong.  Had he lived--" Here he\r\nstopped again abruptly.\r\n\r\nThe tutor waited patiently for five minutes and then screwed his eye-\r\nglass into his eye.\r\n\r\nAs he did so, the old man uttered a sound very like a snore.  Mr\r\nArmstrong gave an imperceptible shrug of his shoulders and inwardly\r\nmeditated a retreat, when the sound came through the darkness again.\r\nThere was something in it which brought the tutor suddenly to his feet.\r\nHe struck a match and hastily lit a candle.\r\n\r\nSquire Ingleton sat there just as he had sat an hour ago when the tutor\r\nfound him, except that the hand on the chair-arm was quiet, and his chin\r\nsunk a little deeper in his chest.  The tutor passed the candle before\r\nthe old man\'s face, and then, scarcely less pallid than his master, rang\r\nthe bell.\r\n\r\n"Raffles," said he, as the page entered, "come here, quick.  The Squire\r\nis ill."\r\n\r\n"I said he was dicky," gasped the boy.  "I knowed it whenever--"\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, sir, and help me lift him to the sofa."\r\n\r\nBetween them they moved the stricken man to the couch, where he lay\r\nopen-eyed, speechless, appealing.\r\n\r\n"We must get Dr Brandram, Raffles."\r\n\r\n"That\'ll puzzle you," said the boy, "a night like this, and the two\r\n\'orses at Castleridge."\r\n\r\n"Is there any chance of your mistress returning to-night?"\r\n\r\n"Not if Tom Robbins knows it.  He\'s mighty tender of his \'orses, and a\r\nnight like this--"\r\n\r\n"Go and fetch the housekeeper at once," said the tutor.\r\n\r\nRaffles vanished.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong was not the man to lose his head on an emergency, but now,\r\nas he bent over the helpless paralytic, and tried to read his wants in\r\nthe eyes that looked up into his, he found it needed a mighty effort to\r\npull himself together and resolve how to act.\r\n\r\nHe must go for the doctor, five miles away.  There was no one else about\r\nthe place who could cover the ground as quickly.  But if he went, he\r\nmust leave the sufferer to the tender mercies of Raffles and the\r\nhousekeeper--a prospect at which Mr Armstrong shuddered; especially\r\nwhen the latter self-important functionary entered, talking at large,\r\nand proposing half a dozen contradictory specifics in the short passage\r\nfrom the door to the sick-couch.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong only delayed to suggest meekly that his impression was\r\nthat a warm bath would, under the circumstances, be of benefit, and\r\nthen, not waiting for the contemptuous "Much you know about it" which\r\nthe suggestion evoked, he set off.\r\n\r\nIt was no light task on a night like this to plough through the snow for\r\nfive miles in search of help, and the lanes to Yeld were, even in open\r\nweather, none of the easiest.  But the tutor was not the kind of man to\r\ntrouble himself about difficulties of that sort, provided only he could\r\nfind the doctor in, and transport him in a reasonable time to Maxfield.\r\n\r\nAs he passed the stables, he glanced within, on the off-chance of\r\nfinding a horse available.  But the place was empty, and not even a\r\nstable-boy could be made to hear his summons.\r\n\r\nSo he tramped out into the road, where the snow lay a foot deep, and\r\nwith long strides carved his way through it towards Yeld.  Half a mile\r\non he overtook a country cart, heavily laden and stuck fast in the snow.\r\n\r\n"Ah!  Hodder," said he to the nonplussed old man in charge, "you may as\r\nwell give it up."\r\n\r\n"So I are without your telling," growled the countryman.\r\n\r\n"Very well; I want your horse for a couple of hours.  The Squire\'s ill,\r\nand I have to fetch the doctor."\r\n\r\nAnd without another word, and heedless of the ejaculations of the\r\nbewildered Hodder, he began to loose the animal\'s girths.\r\n\r\n"I\'m blamed if you have a hair of him," said the yokel.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want one.  Here!" and he pitched him a half-crown.  The man\r\ngaped stupidly at the unharnessing of his beast, and began to pump up\r\nfor another protest.\r\n\r\nBut before the words were ready, Mr Armstrong had led the horse out of\r\nthe shafts and had vaulted on his bare back.\r\n\r\n"Eh," sputtered Hodder, "may I--"\r\n\r\n"Good-bye and thanks," said the tutor, clapping his heels to the\r\nanimal\'s flanks; "you shall have him back safe."\r\n\r\nAnd he plunged away, leaving the gaping son of the soil, with his half-\r\ncrown in his hand, to the laborious task of hoisting his lower jaw back\r\ninto its normal position.\r\n\r\nDr Brandram, in whose medical preserves Maxfield Manor lay, was\r\nsolacing himself with an after-dinner pipe in his little cottage at\r\nYeld, when the tutor, crusted in snow from head to foot, broke\r\nunceremoniously on his privacy.  An intuition told the doctor what was\r\nthe matter before even his visitor could say--\r\n\r\n"The Squire has had a stroke.  Come at once."\r\n\r\nThe doctor put down his pipe, and, with a sigh, kicked off his cosy\r\nslippers.\r\n\r\n"He has chosen a bad night, Armstrong.  How are the roads?"\r\n\r\n"A foot deep.  Shall you drive or ride?"\r\n\r\n"I never ride."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll need both horses to get through, and I can lend you a spent\r\nthird."\r\n\r\n"Thank you.  How did he look?"\r\n\r\n"He knew what had happened, I think, but could not speak or move."\r\n\r\n"Of course.  Suppose you and I do the latter, and postpone the former\r\ntill we are under weigh."\r\n\r\nIn less than ten minutes, the doctor\'s gig was trundling through the\r\nsnow, with three horses to drag it, and Mr Armstrong in charge of the\r\nreins.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the doctor, "he\'s been leading up to this for a long time,\r\nas you have probably observed."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say I have," said Mr Armstrong.\r\n\r\n"Ah! well, you\'ve only known him a year.  I knew him twenty years ago."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" replied the tutor, chirruping encouragement to the horses.\r\n\r\n"Roger Ingleton\'s life twenty years ago was a life to make an insurance\r\ncompany cheerful," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"What changed it?"\r\n\r\n"He had a scape-grace son.  They fell out--there was a furious quarrel--\r\nand one day the father and son--ugh!--fought, with clenched fists, sir,\r\nlike two--two costermongers!--and the boy did not get the best of it.\r\nHe left home, and no wonder, and was never heard of since.  Faugh! it\r\nwas a sickening business."\r\n\r\n"That explains what he was saying this afternoon about a son he had\r\nonce.  He was telling me about it when he was struck."\r\n\r\n"Ay! that blow has been owing him for twenty years.  It is the last\r\nround of the fight, Armstrong.  But," continued he, "this is all a\r\nsecret.  No one knows it at Maxfield.  I doubt if your pupil so much as\r\nimagines he ever had a brother."\r\n\r\n"He has never mentioned it to me," said the tutor.\r\n\r\n"No need that he should know," said the doctor.  "Let the dead bury his\r\ndead."\r\n\r\n"Is he dead, then?"\r\n\r\n"Before the Squire married again," said the doctor, "the poor boy went\r\nstraight to the dogs, and they made an end of him.  There! let\'s talk of\r\nsomething else.  I don\'t know why I tell you what has never passed my\r\nlips for twenty years."\r\n\r\n"I wish you hadn\'t," said Mr Armstrong shortly, whipping up his horses.\r\n\r\nThe two men remained silent during most of that cold, laborious journey.\r\nThe doctor\'s few attempts at conversation fell flat, and he took refuge\r\nfinally in his pipe.  As for the tutor, he had his hands full, steering\r\nhis team between the lane-side ditches, and thinking of the wrecked life\r\nthat lay waiting at the journey\'s end.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly ten o\'clock before the dim lights of Maxfield Manor showed\r\nahead.  The snow on the home-drive was undisturbed by the wheels of any\r\nother vehicle.  The mother and son had not returned, at any rate, yet.\r\n\r\nAs the two men entered, the hall was full of scared domestics, talking\r\nin undertones, and feeding on the occasional bulletin which the\r\nprivileged Raffles was permitted to carry from the sick-room to the\r\nouter world.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of the doctor and Mr Armstrong, they sneaked off\r\ngrudgingly to their own territories, leaving Raffles to escort the\r\ngentlemen to the scene of the tragedy.\r\n\r\nOld Roger Ingleton lay on the sofa, with eyes half-closed, upturned to\r\nthe ceiling; alive still, but no more.  Cups and wine-glasses on the\r\ntable near told of the housekeeper\'s fruitless experiments at\r\nrestoration, and the inflamed countenance of that ministering angel\r\nherself spoke ominously of the four hours during which the sufferer\'s\r\ncomfort had been under her charge.\r\n\r\nThe tutor, after satisfying himself that his mission had not been too\r\nlate, retired to the fireplace, where he leaned dismally, and watched\r\nthrough his eye-glass the doctor\'s examination.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes, the latter walked across to him.\r\n\r\n"Did you say Mrs Ingleton and the boy will not be back till the\r\nmorning?"\r\n\r\n"Probably not."\r\n\r\n"If so, they will be too late; he will not last the night."\r\n\r\n"I will fetch them," said Mr Armstrong quietly.\r\n\r\n"Good fellow! you are having a night of it.  I shall remain here; so you\r\ncan take whichever of my horses you like.  The mare will go best."\r\n\r\n"Thanks!" said the tutor, pulling himself together for this new task.\r\n\r\nBefore he quitted the room, he stepped up to the couch and bent for a\r\nmoment over the helpless form of his employer.  There was no recognition\r\nin the glazed eyes, and the hand, which he just touched with his own,\r\nwas nerveless and dead already.\r\n\r\nWith a silent nod to the doctor Mr Armstrong left the room, and was\r\npresently once more ploughing on horseback through the deep snow.\r\n\r\nIt was well this man was a man of iron and master of himself, or he\r\nmight have flagged under this new effort, with the distressing prospect\r\nawaiting him at his journey\'s end.\r\n\r\nAs it was, he urged doggedly forward, forgetful of the existence of such\r\nan individual as Frank Armstrong, and dwelling only on the dying man\r\nbehind and the mourners ahead.\r\n\r\nThe clock was chiming one in Castleridge Church when at length he reined\r\nup his spent horse at the stable entrance to the Grange.  Here for a\r\nweary quarter of an hour he rang, called, and whistled before the\r\nglimmer of a lantern gave promise of an answer.\r\n\r\nTo the stable-boy\'s not altogether polite inquiry, Mr Armstrong\r\nreplied, "Mr Ingleton of Maxfield is ill.  Call Robbins, and tell him\r\nto put the horses in immediately, to take his mistress and Mr Roger\r\nhome; and get some one in the house to call them.  Don\'t delay an\r\ninstant."\r\n\r\nThis peremptory speech fairly aroused the sleepy stable-boy, and in a\r\nfew minutes Mr Armstrong was standing in the hall of the Grange talking\r\nto a footman.\r\n\r\n"Take me up to his room," said he, pushing the bewildered servant before\r\nhim up the staircase.\r\n\r\nThe man, not at all sure that he was not in the grip of an armed\r\nburglar, ascended the stair in a maze, not daring to look behind him.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a corridor he stopped.\r\n\r\n"Is that the room?  Give me the lamp!  Go and tell your master to get\r\nup.  Say a messenger has come with bad news from Maxfield; and look\r\nhere--put some wraps in the carriage, and have some coffee or wine ready\r\nin the hall in ten minutes."\r\n\r\nThe fellow, greatly reassured by this short parley, went off to fulfil\r\nhis instructions, while the tutor, with what was very like a sigh,\r\nopened the door and entered his pupil\'s bedroom.\r\n\r\nRoger Ingleton, minor, lay sound asleep, with his arms behind his head\r\nand a smile on his resolute lips.  As the light of the lamp fell on his\r\nface, it looked very pale, with its frame of black curly hair and the\r\ndeep fringe of its long eyelashes; but the finely-chiselled nostrils and\r\nfirm mouth redeemed it from all suspicion of weakness.  Even as he slept\r\nyou might judge this lad of nineteen had a will of his own hidden up in\r\nthe delicate framework of his body, and resembled his father at least in\r\nthis, that his outer man was too narrow a tenement for what it\r\ncontained.  Almost at the first flash of the light his big black eyes\r\nopened, and he started to a sitting posture, bewildered, scared.\r\n\r\n"Oh! why, hullo, Armstrong! what\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to disturb you, Roger, but--"\r\n\r\nThe boy bounded out of bed and stood facing his tutor in his night-\r\ndress.\r\n\r\n"But I want you to dress as sharp as you can.  Your father is unwell."\r\n\r\n"Unwell?" repeated the boy, shivering.  "You do not mean he is dead?"\r\n\r\n"No--no; but ill.  He has had a stroke.  Dr Brandram is with him.  I\r\nthought it better not to wait till the morning before fetching you."\r\n\r\n"Mother--does she know?"\r\n\r\n"By this time."\r\n\r\n"Why ever did we not go back?" groaned the boy.  "Is there _any_ hope,\r\nArmstrong?"\r\n\r\n"Some--yes.  Go to your mother and tell her so.  The carriage will be\r\nready in five minutes."\r\n\r\nIn five minutes the boy and his mother descended to the hall, where\r\nalready their host and hostess were down to bid them farewell.  It was\r\ndifficult to imagine that the slender dark-eyed handsome woman, who\r\nstood there and looked round for a moment so white and trembling and\r\nbewildered, was really the mother of the young man on whose arm she\r\nleant.  Even under a blow such as this Mrs Ingleton belied her age by a\r\ndecade.  She was still on the sunny side of forty.  You and I might have\r\ndoubted if she was yet thirty.\r\n\r\nCaptain Curtice and his wife had the true kindness to attempt no words\r\nas they sympathisingly bade their visitors farewell.  When the hall-door\r\nopened and let in the cold blast, the poor lady staggered a moment and\r\nclung closer to her son\'s side.  Then abandoning composure to the wintry\r\nwinds, she found her best refuge in tears, and let herself be led to the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nThe tutor helped to put her in, and looked inquiringly at his pupil.\r\n\r\n"Come in too, please," said the latter; "there is room inside."\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong would fain have taken his seat beside Robbins on the box.\r\nHe hated scenes, and tears, and tragedies of all sorts.  But there was\r\nsomething in his pupil\'s voice which touched him.  He took his place\r\nwithin, and prayed that the moments might fly till they reached\r\nMaxfield.\r\n\r\nScarcely a word was spoken.  Once Roger hazarded a question, but it was\r\nthe signal for a new outburst on his mother\'s part; and he wisely\r\ndesisted, and leant back in his corner, silent and motionless.  As for\r\nthe tutor, with the front seat to himself, he nursed his knee, and gazed\r\nfixedly out of the window the whole way.\r\n\r\nWhat weeks those two hours seemed!  How the horses laboured, and panted,\r\nand halted!  And how interminably dismal was the dull muffled crunching\r\nof the wheels through the snow!\r\n\r\nAt length a blurred light passed the window, and the tutor released his\r\nknee and put up his eye-glass.\r\n\r\n"Here we are," said he; "that was the lodge."\r\n\r\nRoger slowly and reluctantly sat forward, and wrapped his mother\'s shawl\r\ncloser round her.\r\n\r\nRaffles stood on the door-step, and in the hall beyond Mr Armstrong\r\ncould see the doctor standing.\r\n\r\nAs he stepped out, the page touched him on the arm.\r\n\r\n"No \'urry," whispered he; "all over!"\r\n\r\nWhereupon the tutor quietly crept away to the seclusion of his own room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nTHE LIVING AMONG THE DEAD.\r\n\r\nThe household of Maxfield, worn-out by the excitement of the night,\r\nslept, or rather lay in bed, till hard on midday.\r\n\r\nThe tutor, as he slowly turned on his side and caught sight of the\r\nwinter sun through the frost-bespangled window, felt profoundly\r\ndisinclined to rise.  He shrank from the tasks that awaited him--the\r\ntask of witnessing the grief of the widow and the pale looks of the\r\norphan heir, the dismal negotiations with undertakers and clergymen and\r\nlawyers, the stupid questions of the domestics, the sickly fragrance of\r\nstephanotis in the house.  Then, too, there was the awkward uncertainty\r\nas to his own future.  What effect would the tragedy of last night have\r\non that?  Was it a notice to quit, or what?  He should be sorry to go.\r\nHe liked the place, he liked his pupil, and further, he had nowhere else\r\nto go.  Altogether Mr Armstrong felt very reluctant to exchange his\r\neasy bed for the chances and changes of the waking world.  Besides,\r\nlastly, the water in his bath, he could see, was frozen; and it was\r\nhopeless on a day like this to expect that Raffles would bring him\r\nsufficient hot, even to shave with.\r\n\r\nHowever, the tutor had had some little practice before now in doing what\r\nhe did not like.  With a sigh and a shiver, therefore, he flung aside\r\nhis blankets and proceeded to break the ice literally, and take his\r\nbath.  After that he felt decidedly better, and with the help of a\r\nsteady ten minutes grind at the dumb-bells, he succeeded in pulling\r\nhimself together.\r\n\r\nHe had reached this stage in his toilet when a knock came at the door.\r\n\r\n"Come in, Raffles," said Mr Armstrong, beginning to see some prospect\r\nof a shave after all.\r\n\r\nIt was not Raffles, but Dr Brandram, equipped for the road.\r\n\r\n"I\'m off, Armstrong," said he.  "I\'d ask you to come and drive me, only\r\nI think you are wanted here.  See the boy eats enough and doesn\'t mope.\r\nYou must amuse him if you can.  You understand what I told you last\r\nnight was not for him.  By the way,"--here the doctor held out a sealed\r\npacket--"this was lying on the old man\'s table last night.  It was\r\nprobably to give it to you that he sent for you in the afternoon, and\r\nthen forgot it.  Well, good-bye.  I shall come to-morrow if the roads\r\nare passable.  I only hope, for my sake, all this will not make any\r\ndifference to your remaining at Maxfield."\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong finished his toilet leisurely, and then proceeded to\r\nexamine the packet.\r\n\r\nIt was a large envelope, addressed, "Frank Armstrong, Esquire," in the\r\nold man\'s quavering hand.\r\n\r\nWithin was another envelope, firmly sealed, on which the same hand had\r\nwritten these words--\r\n\r\n"_To be given unopened into the hands of Roger Ingleton, junior, on his\r\ntwentieth birthday_."\r\n\r\nThe effort of writing those few words had evidently been almost more\r\nthan the writer could accomplish, for towards the end the letters became\r\nalmost illegible, and the words were huddled in a heap at the corner of\r\nthe paper.  The sealing, too, to judge from the straggling blots of wax\r\nall over and the ineffective marks of the seal, must have been the\r\nlabour of a painful morning to the feeble, half-blind old man.\r\n\r\nTo the tutor, however, as he held the missive in his hand, and looked at\r\nit with the reverence one feels for a token from the dead, it seemed to\r\nmake one or two things tolerably clear.\r\n\r\nFirst, that the contents, whatever they were, were secret and important,\r\nelse the old man would never have taken upon himself a labour he could\r\nso easily have devolved upon another.  Secondly, that this old man,\r\nrightly or wrongly, regarded Frank Armstrong as a man to be trusted, and\r\ncontemplated that a year hence he would occupy the same position with\r\nregard to the heir of Maxfield as he did now.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at which conclusions, the tutor returned the packet to\r\nits outer envelope and locked the whole up in his desk.  Which done, he\r\ndescended to the breakfast-room.\r\n\r\nAs he had expected, no one was there.  What was worse, there was no sign\r\neither of fire or breakfast.  To a man who has not tasted food for about\r\ntwenty hours, such a discovery could not fail to be depressing, and Mr\r\nArmstrong meekly decided to summon Raffles to his assistance.  As he\r\npassed down the passage, he could not forbear halting for a moment at\r\nthe door of a certain room, behind which he knew the mortal remains of\r\nhis dead employer lay.  As he paused, not liking to enter, liking still\r\nless to pass on, the sound of footsteps within startled him.  It was not\r\ndifficult, after a moment\'s reflection, to guess to whom they belonged,\r\nand the tutor softly tapped on the door.\r\n\r\nThe only answer was the abrupt halting of the footsteps.  Mr Armstrong\r\nentered and found his pupil.\r\n\r\nRoger was standing in the ulster he had worn last night.  His eyes were\r\nblack and heavy with weariness, his face was almost as white as the face\r\nof him who lay on the couch, and as he turned to the open door his teeth\r\nchattered with cold.\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t leave him alone," whispered he apologetically, as the tutor\r\nlaid a gentle hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n"Of course--of course," replied Mr Armstrong.  "I guessed it was you.\r\nWould you rather be left alone?"\r\n\r\n"No," said the lad wearily.  "I thought by staying here I should get\r\nsome help--some--I don\'t know what, Armstrong.  But instead, I\'m half\r\nasleep.  I\'ve been yawning and shivering, and forgotten who was here--\r\nand--" Here his eyes filled with tears.\r\n\r\n"Dear old fellow," said the tutor, "you are fagged out.  Come and get a\r\nlittle rest."\r\n\r\nRoger sighed, partly to feel himself beaten, partly at the prospect of\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n"All right!" said he.  "I\'m ashamed you should see me so weak when I\r\nwanted to be strong.  Yes, I\'ll come--in one minute."\r\n\r\nHe walked over to the couch and knelt beside it.  His worn-out body had\r\nsuccumbed at last to the misery against which it had battled so long,\r\nand for a moment he yielded himself to his sorrow.  The tutor waited a\r\nmoment, and then walked quietly from the room.\r\n\r\nFor a quarter of an hour he paced restlessly in the cold passage\r\noutside; then, as his pupil did not appear, he returned to the chamber\r\nof death.  Roger Ingleton, as he expected, had fallen asleep where he\r\nknelt.\r\n\r\nThe wretched days between the death and the funeral dragged on in the\r\nusual dismal fashion.  Mrs Ingleton kept her room; the domestics took\r\nthe occasion to neglect their work, and Roger Ingleton, minor, passed\r\nthrough all the stages from inconsolable misery to subdued cheerfulness.\r\nMr Armstrong alone went through no stages, but remained the same\r\nunimpassioned individual he had been ever since he became a member of\r\nthe Maxfield household.\r\n\r\n"Armstrong," said the boy, the day before the funeral, "do you know, I\'m\r\nthe only male Ingleton left?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know it.  Have you no uncles or cousins?"\r\n\r\n"None on our side.  Some distant cousins on, mother\'s side, but they\'re\r\nabroad.  We were going over the lot yesterday, mother and I; but we\r\ncouldn\'t scrape up a single relation to come to-morrow.  We shall have\r\nto get you and Brandram and fathers solicitor to come to the funeral, if\r\nyou don\'t mind."\r\n\r\n"Of course I shall come," said Mr Armstrong.\r\n\r\n"And, by the way, it seems rather queer, doesn\'t it, that I shall have\r\ncharge of all this big property, and, I suppose, be master of all the\r\npeople about the place."\r\n\r\n"Naturally.  Amongst your humble and obedient servants the present tutor\r\nof Maxfield will need to be included."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you!" said Roger, smiling; "yes, you\'ll need to look out how you\r\nbehave, you know, or I shall have to terminate our engagement.  Isn\'t it\r\nqueer?"\r\n\r\nQueer as it was, the tutor winced at the jest, and screwed his eye-glass\r\na little deeper into his eye.\r\n\r\n"Seriously, though," said Roger, "I\'m awfully glad I\'ve got you here to\r\nadvise me.  I want to do things well about the place, and keep square\r\nwith the tenants, and improve a great many things.  I noticed a whole\r\nlot of cottages to-day that want rebuilding.  And I think I ought to\r\nbuild a club-room for the young fellows in the village, and give a new\r\nlifeboat to replace the `Vega,\' What do you think?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you this time to-morrow.  Meanwhile what do you say to a ride\r\nbefore dark?  It would do you good."\r\n\r\nThey had a long trot through the lanes and along the shore, ending with\r\na canter over the downs, which landed the heir of Maxfield at home with\r\na glow in his cheeks and an appetite such as he had not known for a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nNext day the funeral took place in the family vault at the little\r\nchurchyard of Yeld.  The villagers, as in duty bound, flocked to pay\r\ntheir last respects to the old Squire, whose face for the last twenty\r\nyears they had scarcely seen, and of whose existence, save on rent-day,\r\nmany of them had been well-nigh ignorant.\r\n\r\nMany an eye turned curiously to the slim, pale boy, as he stood alone,\r\nthe last of his house, at the open tomb; and many a speculation as to\r\nhis temper and prospects occupied minds which were supposed to be intent\r\non the solemn words of the Burial Service.\r\n\r\nRoger himself, with that waywardness of the attention which afflicts us\r\neven in the gravest acts of our life, found himself listening to the\r\nwords in a sort of dream, while his mind was occupied in reading over to\r\nhimself the names of his ancestors inscribed on the panels of the vault.\r\n\r\n"John Ingleton of Maxfield Manor, who died ye ninth day of June, 1760,\r\naetat 74.\r\n\r\n"Peter Ingleton of Maxfield Manor, his son, obiit March 6, 1794.\r\n\r\n"Paul Ingleton, only son of above Peter; born January 1, 1790, died\r\nSeptember 20, 1844.\r\n\r\n"Ruth, beloved wife of Roger Ingleton, Esquire, of Maxfield Manor, who\r\ndied on February 14, 1865, aged 37."\r\n\r\nNow a new inscription would be added.\r\n\r\n"Roger Ingleton, son of the above-named Paul Ingleton, who died January\r\n10, 1885."\r\n\r\nAnd when that was added, there would yet be space for another name\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nRoger shuddered a little, and brought his mind back with an effort to\r\nthe solemn act which was taking place.\r\n\r\nThe clergyman\'s voice ceased, and the fatherless lad stooped to get a\r\nlast view of the flower-covered coffin.  Then, with a heart lonelier\r\nthan he had ever known it before, he turned away.\r\n\r\nThe people fell back and made a silent lane for him to pass.\r\n\r\n"Poor lad," said a country wife, as she looked after him, "pity knows,\r\nhe\'ll be this way again before long."\r\n\r\n"Hold thy tongue," said another; "thee\'d look white and shaky if thee\r\nwas the only man of thy name left on earth--eh, Uncle Hodder?"\r\n\r\n"Let un go," said the venerable proprietor of the tutor\'s borrowed horse\r\nlast week, "let \'un go.  The Ingletons was all weaklings, but they held\r\nout to nigh on threescore and ten years.  All bar the best of them--\r\nthere was naught weak about him, yet he dropped off in blossom-time."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, poor lad," said the elder of the women in a whisper, "pity of\r\nthe boy.  He\'d have taken the load on his shoulders to-day better than\r\nyonder white child."\r\n\r\n"Hold thy tongue and come and take thy look at the old Squire\'s last\r\nlying-place."\r\n\r\nRoger overheard none of their talk, but wandered on, lonely, but angry\r\nwith himself for feeling as unemotional as he did.  He told the coachman\r\nhe would walk home, and started along the half-thawed lanes, hoping that\r\nthe five miles solitary walk would help to bring him into a frame of\r\nmind more appropriate to the occasion.\r\n\r\nBut try as he would, his mind wandered; first to his mother; then to\r\nMaxfield and the villagers; then to his pet schemes for a model village;\r\nthen to Armstrong and his studies; then to a certain pair of foils that\r\nhung in his room; then to the possibility of a yacht next summer; then\r\nto the county festivities next winter, with perhaps a ball at Maxfield;\r\nthen to his approaching majority, and all the delights of unfettered\r\nmanhood; then--\r\n\r\nHe had got so far at the end of a mile, when he heard steps tramping\r\nthrough the mud behind him.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr Armstrong.\r\n\r\nThe boy\'s first impulse was to put on an air of dejection he was far\r\nfrom feeling; but his honesty came to his rescue in time.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Armstrong!  I\'m so glad it\'s you.  You\'ll never guess what I was\r\nthinking about when I heard you?"\r\n\r\n"About being elected M.P. for the county?" asked the tutor gravely.\r\n\r\n"How did you guess that?  I tried to think about other things, you know,\r\nbut--"\r\n\r\n"Luckily you chose to be natural instead.  Well, I hope you\'ll be\r\nelected, when the time comes."\r\n\r\nThe two beguiled their walk in talk which, if not exactly what might\r\nhave been expected of mourners, at least served to restore the boy\'s\r\nhighly-strung mind to its proper tone, and to make the aspect of things\r\nin general brighter for him than it had been when he started so dismally\r\nfrom the graveyard.\r\n\r\n"Now," said he, with a sigh, as they entered the house, "now comes the\r\nawful business of reading the will.  Pottinger is sure to make an\r\noccasion of it.  It would be worth your while to be present to hear him\r\nperform."\r\n\r\n"Thanks!" said the tutor; "I\'ll look to you for a full account of the\r\nceremony by and by.  I\'ll accompany it to slow music upstairs."\r\n\r\nBut as it happened, Mr Armstrong was not permitted to escape, as he had\r\nfondly hoped, to his piano.  Raffles followed him presently to his room\r\nand said--\r\n\r\n"Please, sir, Mr Pottinger sends his compliments, and will be glad if\r\nyou will step down to the library, sir."\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong scowled.\r\n\r\n"What does he want?" he muttered.\r\n\r\n"He wants a gentleman or two to say \'ear, \'ear, I fancy," said the page,\r\nwith a grin.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong gave a melancholy glance at his piano, and screwed his\r\nglass in his eye aggressively.\r\n\r\n"All right, Raffles; you can go."\r\n\r\n"What does the old idiot want with me, I wonder," said he to himself,\r\n"unless it\'s to give me a month\'s notice, and tell me I may clear out?\r\nHeigho!  I hope not."\r\n\r\nWith which pleasant misgivings, he strolled down-stairs.\r\n\r\nIn the library was assembled a small but select audience to do Mr\r\nPottinger, the Yeld attorney, honour.  The widow was there, looking pale\r\nbut charming in her deep mourning and tasteful cap.  Roger was there,\r\nrestless, impatient, and a little angry at all the fuss.  Dr Brandram\r\nand the Rector were there, resigned, as men who had been through\r\nceremonies of the kind before.  And a deputation of dead-servants sat on\r\nchairs near the door, gratified to be included in the party, and\r\nmentally going over their services to the testator, and appraising them\r\nin anticipation.\r\n\r\n"We were waiting for you, Mr Armstrong," said the attorney severely, as\r\nthe tutor entered.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong looked not at all well pleased to be thus accosted, and\r\nwalked to a seat in the bay-window behind Mr Pottinger.\r\n\r\nThe man of the law put on his glasses, took a sip of water from a\r\ntumbler he had had brought in, blew his nose, and glancing round on his\r\naudience with all the enjoyment of a man who feels himself master of the\r\nsituation, began to make a little speech.\r\n\r\nThere was first a little condescending preamble concerning the virtues\r\nof the deceased, which every one but Roger listened to respectfully.\r\nThe son felt it as much as he could put up with to sit still and hear\r\nit, and began to fidget ominously, and greatly to the disturbance of the\r\nspeaker.  When Mr Pottinger, after a few reproachful pauses, left this\r\ntopic and began to discourse on his own relations with the late Squire,\r\nit was the turn of Dr Brandram to become restless.\r\n\r\n"This is not the occasion for dwelling on the gratification I received\r\nfrom--"\r\n\r\nHere the doctor deliberately rose and walked across the room for a\r\nfootstool, which, as deliberately, he walked back with and laid at the\r\nfeet of Mrs Ingleton.  "Beg pardon--go on," said he, meeting the\r\nastonished eye of the attorney.\r\n\r\n"The gratification I received from the kind expressions--"\r\n\r\nHere a large coal inconsiderately fell out of the fire with a loud\r\nclamour.  Raffles, with considerable commotion, came from his seat and\r\nproceeded to restore it to its lost estate.\r\n\r\nMr Pottinger took his glasses from his nose and regarded the\r\nperformance with such abject distress, that Roger, catching sight of his\r\nface, involuntarily smiled.  "Really," exclaimed the now thoroughly\r\noffended friend of the family, "really, my boy, on an occasion such as\r\nthis--"\r\n\r\nHere the Rector, to every one\'s relief, came gallantly to the rescue.\r\n"This is very tedious, Mr Pottinger," said he.  "The friends here, I am\r\nsure, will prefer that you should omit all these useless preliminaries,\r\nand come to the business at once.  Let me read the document for you; my\r\neyes are younger than yours."\r\n\r\nAt this terrific act of insubordination, and the almost blasphemous\r\nsuggestion which capped it, the lawyer fell back in his chair and broke\r\nout into a profuse perspiration, gazing at the Rector as he would at\r\nsome suddenly intruding wild animal.  Then, with a gasp, taking in the\r\nperil of the whole situation, he hastily took up the will and plunged\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\nIt was a long, tedious document, hard to understand; and when it was\r\nended, no one exactly grasped its purport.\r\n\r\nThen came the moment of Mr Pottinger\'s revenge.  The party was at his\r\nmercy after all.\r\n\r\n"What does it all amount to?" said the doctor, interpreting the\r\nperplexed looks of the company.\r\n\r\n"I had better perhaps explain it in simple words," said the attorney\r\ncondescendingly, "if you will give me your attention."\r\n\r\nYou might have heard a pin drop now.\r\n\r\n"Briefly, the provisions of our dear friend\'s will are these.  Proper\r\nprovision is made for the support in comfort of the widow during her\r\nlife.  Legacies are also left, as you have heard, to certain friends,\r\nservants, and charities.  The whole of the remaining property, which it\r\nis my impression will be found to be very considerable, is left in trust\r\nfor the testator\'s only son, Roger, our young friend here, who is to\r\nreceive it absolutely on reaching the age of twenty-one.  The conditions\r\nof the trust are a trifle peculiar.  There are three trustees, who are\r\nalso guardians of the heir.  The first is Mrs Ingleton, the widow; the\r\nsecond is Edward Oliphant, Esquire, of Her Majesty\'s Indian Army, second\r\ncousin, I understand, of Mrs Ingleton, and, in the event (which I trust\r\nis not likely) of the death of our young friend here, heir-presumptive\r\nto the property.  His trusteeship is dependent on his coming to this\r\ncountry and assuming the duties of guardian to the heir, and provision\r\nis made accordingly.  The third trustee and guardian is Mr Frank\r\nArmstrong, who is entitled to act so long as he holds his present post\r\nof tutor to the heir, which post he will retain only during Mrs\r\nIngleton\'s pleasure.  It is also provided that, in the event of any\r\ndifference of opinion among the trustees, Mrs Ingleton (as is most\r\nproper) shall be permitted to decide; and lastly--a curious eccentricity\r\non our dear friend\'s part, which was perhaps hardly necessary to\r\ninsert--in the event of Roger Ingleton, previous to his attaining his\r\nmajority, becoming a felon, a lunatic, or marrying, he is to be regarded\r\nas dead, and the property thereby passes to the next heir, Captain\r\nOliphant.  I think we may congratulate ourselves on what is really a\r\nvery simple will, and which, provided the trustees named consent to act,\r\npresents very little difficulty.  I have telegraphed already to Captain\r\nOliphant.  Mr Armstrong, will you do me the favour, at your\r\nconvenience, of intimating to me your consent or otherwise?"\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong made no response.  It was indeed doubtful whether he had\r\nheard the question.  For at that precise moment, gazing about him in\r\nbewilderment at the unexpected responsibility thus thrown upon him, his\r\neyes became suddenly riveted by a picture.  It was a portrait, partly\r\nconcealed behind the curtain of the window in which he sat, but unveiled\r\nsufficiently to disclose the face of a fair-haired boy, younger by some\r\nyears than Roger, with clear blue eyes and strong compressed mouth,\r\nsomewhat sullen in temper, but with an air of recklessness and\r\ndetermination which, even in the portrait, fascinated the beholder.  Mr\r\nArmstrong, although he had frequently been in his late employer\'s study,\r\nhad never noticed this picture before.  Now, as he caught sight of it\r\nand suddenly met the flash of those wild bright eyes, he experienced\r\nsomething like a shock.  He could not help recalling Dr Brandram\'s sad\r\nstory the other day.  Something seemed mysteriously to connect this\r\nportrait and the story together in his mind.  Strange that at such a\r\nmoment, when the fate of the younger son was being decided, his guardian\r\nshould thus come suddenly face to face with the elder!\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong was not a superstitious man, but he felt decidedly glad\r\nwhen a general break up of the party allowed him to get out of range of\r\nthese not altogether friendly eyes, and escape to the seclusion of his\r\nown room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nA MISSING INSCRIPTION.\r\n\r\nA week later, Mr Pottinger, as he trotted into his office, found a\r\nletter and a telegram lying side by side on his desk.\r\n\r\nHe opened the telegram first and read--\r\n\r\n"Bombay, January 17.  Consent.  Am starting, Oliphant."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right," said the lawyer to himself.  "We shall have one\r\ncompetent executor, at any rate."\r\n\r\nHe endorsed the telegram and proceeded to open the letter.  It too was a\r\nvery brief communication.\r\n\r\n  "Sir, I beg to say I accept the duties of trustee and guardian\r\n  conferred on me by the will of the late Roger Ingleton, Esquire.\r\n\r\n  "Yours, etcetera,\r\n\r\n  "Frank Armstrong."\r\n\r\n"Humph!" growled the attorney.  "I was afraid so.  Well, well, it\'s not\r\nmy affair.  The Squire knew my opinion, so my conscience is clear.  An\r\nadventurer, nothing less--a dangerous man.  Don\'t like him!  Well,\r\nwell!"\r\n\r\nTo do Mr Pottinger justice, this opinion of his was of no recent date.\r\nIndeed, it was of as long standing as the tutor\'s first arrival at\r\nMaxfield, eighteen months ago.  It was one of the few matters on which\r\nhe and his late client had differed.\r\n\r\nCalmly indifferent as to the effect of his communication on the lawyer,\r\nMr Armstrong was at that moment having an audience with his co-trustee\r\nand mistress, Mrs Ingleton.\r\n\r\n"Mr Armstrong," said she, "I hope for all our sakes you see your way to\r\naccept the duties my dear husband requested of you."\r\n\r\n"I have written to Mr Pottinger to notify my consent."\r\n\r\n"I am so glad.  I shall have to depend on you for so much.  It will be\r\nso good for Roger to have you with him.  His father was always anxious\r\nabout him--most anxious.  You know, Mr Armstrong," added she, "if there\r\nis any--any question as to salary, or anything I can do to make your\r\nposition here comfortable, you must tell me.  For Roger\'s sake I am\r\nanxious you should be happy here."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, madam.  I am most comfortable," said Mr Armstrong, looking\r\nanything but what he described himself.  He had a detestation of\r\nbusiness interviews, and wished profoundly he was out of this.\r\n\r\n"I am sure you will like Captain Oliphant," said the widow.  "I have not\r\nseen him for many years--indeed, since shortly after Roger was born; but\r\nwe have heard from him constantly, and Mr Ingleton had a high opinion\r\nof him.  He is a very distant cousin of mine, you know."\r\n\r\n"So I understand."\r\n\r\n"Poor fellow! his wife died quite young.  His three children will be\r\nquite grown up now, poor things.  Well, thank you very much, Mr\r\nArmstrong.  I hope we shall always be good friends for dear Roger\'s\r\nsake.  Good-bye."\r\n\r\nRoger, as may be imagined, had not waited a whole week before\r\nascertaining his tutor\'s intentions.\r\n\r\nHe had been a good deal staggered at first by his father\'s will, with\r\nits curious provisions; but, amongst a great deal that was perplexing\r\nand disappointing in it, he derived no little comfort from the fact that\r\nMr Armstrong was to be one of his legal protectors.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see, you know," said he, as he lounged against his tutor\'s\r\nmantelpiece one evening.  "I don\'t see why a fellow of nineteen can\'t be\r\ntrusted to behave himself without being tied up in this way.  It\'s my\r\nimpression I know as well how to behave now as I am likely to do when I\r\nam twenty-one."\r\n\r\n"That is a reflection in advance on my dealings with you during the next\r\ntwo years," said the tutor with a grin, as he swung himself half round\r\non the piano-stool so as to get his hand within reach of the keys.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind _you_," said the boy, "but I hope this Cousin Edward, or\r\nwhoever he is, won\'t try to `deal\' with me too."\r\n\r\n"I am informed he is virtue and amiability itself," said the tutor.\r\n\r\n"If he is, all serene.  I\'ll take my walks abroad with one little hand\r\nin yours, and the other in his, like a good boy.  If he\'s not, there\'ll\r\nbe a row, Armstrong.  In anticipation of which I feel in the humour for\r\na turn at the foils."\r\n\r\nSo they adjourned into the big empty room dedicated to the manly sports\r\nof the man and his boy, and there for half an hour a mortal combat\r\nraged, at the end of which Roger pulled off his mask and said, panting--\r\n\r\n"Where did you learn foils, Armstrong?  For a year I\'ve been trying to\r\nrun you through the body, and I\'ve never even yet scratched your arm."\r\n\r\n"I fenced a good deal at Oxford."\r\n\r\n"Ah!  I wonder if I shall ever go to Oxford?  This will cuts me out of\r\nthat nicely."\r\n\r\n"Not at all.  How?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you can\'t be my tutor here while I\'m an undergraduate there, can\r\nyou?  I\'d sooner give up Oxford than you, Armstrong."\r\n\r\n"Kind of you--wrong of you too, perhaps.  But at twenty-one you\'ll be\r\nyour own master."\r\n\r\n"I may not be in the humour then.  Besides, I shall have my hands full\r\nof work here then.  It\'s hard lines to have to kick my heels in idleness\r\nfor two years, while I\'ve so many plans in my head for improving the\r\nplace, and to have to ask your leave to spend so much as a halfpenny."\r\n\r\n"It is rather tragic.  It strikes me, however, that Cousin Edward will\r\nbe the financial partner of our firm.  I shall attend to the literary\r\npart of the business."\r\n\r\n"And poor mother has to umpire in all your squabbles.  Upon my word, why\r\ncouldn\'t I have been treated like a man straight off, instead of being\r\nwashed and dressed and fed with a spoon and wheeled in a perambulator by\r\nthree respectable middle-aged persons, who all vote me a nuisance."\r\n\r\n"In the first place, Roger Ingleton, I am not yet middle-aged.  In the\r\nsecond place, I do not vote you a nuisance.  In the third place, if you\r\nstand there much longer like that, with your coat off, you will catch\r\nyour death of cold, which would annoy me exceedingly."\r\n\r\nThis was one of many conversations which took place.  It was difficult\r\nto say whether Mr Armstrong took his new duties seriously or not.  He\r\ngenerally contrived to say something flippant about them when his pupil\r\ntackled him on the subject, but at the same time he rarely failed to\r\ngive the boy a hint or two that somewhere hidden away behind the cool,\r\nodd exterior of the man, there lurked a very warm corner for the\r\nfatherless heir of Maxfield.\r\n\r\nFor the next week or two the days passed uneventfully.  The manor-house\r\nsettled down to its old routine, minus the old man who had once been its\r\nmaster.  The villagers, having satisfied themselves that things were\r\nlikely to be pretty much the same for them under the new _regime_ as the\r\nold, resumed their usual ways, and touched their caps regularly to the\r\nyoung Squire.  The trampled grass in Yeld churchyard lifted its head\r\nagain, and a new inscription was added to the family roll on the door of\r\nthe vault.\r\n\r\n"Armstrong," said the heir one day, as he stood inspecting this last\r\nmemorial, "I have a good mind to have my brother\'s name put on here\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\nThis was the first time the tutor had ever heard the boy mention his\r\nbrother.  Indeed, he had, like Dr Brandram, doubted whether Roger so\r\nmuch as knew that he had had a brother.\r\n\r\n"What brother?" he inquired vaguely.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he died long ago, before I was born.  He was the son of father\'s\r\nfirst wife, you know," pointing to the inscription of Ruth Ingleton\'s\r\nname.  "He is not buried here--he died abroad, I believe--but I think\r\nhis death should be recorded with the others.  Don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said the tutor.\r\n\r\n"I must try to find the exact date," said Roger as they walked away.\r\n"My father would hardly ever talk about him; his death must have been a\r\nknock-down blow to him, and I believe it broke his mother\'s heart.\r\nSometimes I wish he had lived.  He was called Roger too.  I dare say\r\nBrandram or the Vicar can tell me about it."\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong was a good deal concerned at this unexpected curiosity on\r\nthe boy\'s part.  He doubted whether it would not be better to tell him\r\nthe sad story at once, as he had heard it from the doctor.  He disliked\r\nsecrets extremely, especially when he happened to be the custodian of\r\nthem; and painful as the discovery of this one might be to his ward, it\r\nmight be best that he should know it now, instead of hovering\r\nindefinitely in profitless mystery.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, with some sense of relief that, half-way home, he\r\nperceived Dr Brandram in the road ahead.  The doctor was, in fact,\r\nbound for Maxfield.\r\n\r\n"By the way, doctor," said the tutor, determined to take the bull by the\r\nhorns, and glaring at his friend rather fiercely through his eye-glass,\r\n"we were talking about you just now.  Roger has been telling me about an\r\nelder brother of his who died long ago and thinks some record of the\r\ndeath should be made on the vault.  I think so too."\r\n\r\n"I was saying," said Roger, "my father never cared to talk about it; so,\r\nexcept that he died abroad, and that his name was the same as mine, I\r\nreally don\'t know much about him.  Did you know him?"\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked uncomfortable, and not altogether grateful to Mr\r\nArmstrong for landing him in this dilemma.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think," said he, ignoring the last question, "as the Squire\r\ndid not put up an inscription, it would be better to leave the tomb as\r\nit is?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see that," said the boy.  "Of course I should say where he\r\nreally did die.  Where was that, by the way?"\r\n\r\n"I really did not hear.  Abroad, I understood your father to say."\r\n\r\n"Was he delicate, then, that he had to go away?  How old was he,\r\ndoctor?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, he was so seldom at home, and, when he was, I saw so\r\nlittle of him, that my memory is very hazy about him altogether.  He\r\ncan\'t have been more than a boy of fifteen or sixteen, I should say.  By\r\nthe way, Roger, how does the new cob do?"\r\n\r\n"Middling.  He\'s rather lumpy to ride.  I shall get mother to swop him\r\nfor a horse, if she can.  I say, doctor, what was he like?"\r\n\r\n"Who?--The cob?  Oh, your brother!  I fancy he was a fine young fellow,\r\nbut not particularly good-looking."\r\n\r\n"At all like me?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all, I should say.  But really, as I say, I can recall very\r\nlittle about him."\r\n\r\nThe doctor uttered this in a tone which conveyed so broad a hint that he\r\ndid not relish the subject, that Roger, decidedly mystified, desisted\r\nfrom further inquiries.\r\n\r\n"What on earth," said the former to Mr Armstrong, when at last they had\r\nreached Maxfield and the boy had left them, "what on earth has put all\r\nthis into his head?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot tell you.  I rather hoped you would tell him all you knew; it\r\nwould come better from you.  If I know anything of Roger, he will find\r\nit out for himself, whether you like it or not."\r\n\r\n"Nice thing to be a family doctor," growled Dr Brandram, "and have\r\ncharge of the family skeletons.  Between you and me, Armstrong, I was\r\nnever quite satisfied about the story of the boy\'s death abroad.  The\r\nold man said he had had news of it, and that was all anybody, even the\r\npoor mother, ever got out of him."\r\n\r\n"Really, Brandram," said the tutor, "you are a most uncomfortable\r\nperson.  I wish you would not make me a party to these mysteries.  I\r\ndon\'t like them, they are upsetting."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, old fellow," replied the doctor, "whatever it was once,\r\nit\'s no mystery now; for the poor fellow has long ago made good his\r\nright to an inscription on the tombstone.  You need have no doubt of\r\nthat."\r\n\r\nA letter with an Indian post-mark, which arrived that same evening,\r\nserved for the present, at least, to divert the thoughts of Roger as\r\nwell as of his tutor to other channels.\r\n\r\nThe letter was from Captain Oliphant addressed to Mrs Ingleton.\r\n\r\n"My very dear cousin," it read, "need I say with what deep sympathy I\r\nreceived the news of our dear Roger\'s sudden call?  At this great\r\ndistance, blows of this kind fall with cruel heaviness, and I assure you\r\nI felt crushed as I realised that I should no more grasp the hand of one\r\nof the noblest men it has been my privilege to call by the name of\r\nfriend.  If my loss is so great, what must _yours_ be?  I dare not think\r\nof it!  I was truly touched by our dear one\'s thought of me in desiring\r\nthat I should join you in the care of his orphaned boy.  I regard this\r\ndying wish as a sacred trust put upon me, which gratitude and love alike\r\nrequire that I should accept.  Ere this letter reaches you, I shall\r\nmyself be nearing England.  The provision our dear Roger has made has\r\nemboldened me to resign my commission, so that I may devote my whole\r\ntime without distraction to my new charge.  You know, dear cousin, the\r\nspecial bond of sympathy that unites us; your boy has been robbed of a\r\nparent; my children long since have had to mourn a mother.  I cannot\r\nleave them here.  They accompany me to England, where perhaps for all of\r\nus there awaits a community of comfort.  I bespeak your motherly heart\r\nfor them, as I promise you a father\'s affection for your boy.  I will\r\nwrite no more at present.  The `Oriana\' is due in London, I believe,\r\nabout February 20, and we shall, I need hardly assure you, not linger\r\nlong before bringing in our own persons to Maxfield whatever sympathy\r\nfour loving hearts can carry amongst them.\r\n\r\n"With love to the dear boy, believe me, dear cousin, your loving and\r\nsympathising fellow-mourner,--\r\n\r\n"Edward Oliphant."\r\n\r\nMrs Ingleton, highly gratified, handed the beautiful letter first to\r\nher son, then to Mr Armstrong.\r\n\r\nRoger was hardly as taken with it as his mother.\r\n\r\n"Civil enough," said he, "and I dare say he means all he says; but I\r\ndon\'t warm to the prospect of being cherished by him.  Besides, there is\r\nsomething a trifle too neat in the way he invites his whole family to\r\nMaxfield.  What do you think, Armstrong?"\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong was perusing the letter with knitted brows and a curl of\r\nhis lips.  He vouchsafed no reply until he had come to the end.  Then he\r\nshook the glass ominously out of his eye and said--\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you that when I see him."\r\n\r\nRoger knew his tutor well enough to see that he did not like the letter\r\nat all, and he felt somewhat fortified in his own misgivings\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n"I wonder what mother will do with them all?" said the boy.  "Surely we\r\naren\'t to have the place turned into a nursery for two years."\r\n\r\n"I understand the young people are more than children," said the tutor.\r\n\r\n"So much the worse," growled Roger.\r\n\r\nOn the morning before the "Oriana" was due, Mrs Ingleton suggested to\r\nher son that it would be a polite thing if he were to go to town and\r\nmeet the travellers on their arrival.  Roger, not particularly charmed\r\nwith the prospect, stipulated that Mr Arm strong should come with him,\r\nand somewhat shocked his fond parent by expressing the hope that the\r\nvessel might be a few days late, and so allow time for a little jaunt in\r\nLondon before the arrival of his new guardian.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong meekly acquiesced in the proposal, and scarcely less\r\nexhilarated than his pupil, retired to pack for the journey.\r\n\r\nRoger meanwhile occupied the interval before starting by writing a\r\nletter in the study.  Since his father\'s death he had taken quiet\r\npossession of this room, one of the pleasantest in the house.  A feeling\r\nof reverence for the dead had prompted him to disturb its contents and\r\nfurniture as little as possible, and hitherto his occupation had\r\nscarcely extended beyond the arm-chair at the fire, and the writing-\r\ntable.  To-day, however, as he sat biting his pen and looking for an\r\ninspiration out of the window, his eye chanced to rest for a moment on a\r\nframe corner peeping from behind a curtain.  He thought nothing of it\r\nfor a while, and having found his idea, went on writing.  But presently\r\nhis eyes strayed again, and once more lit upon the misplaced piece of\r\ngilding.\r\n\r\nHe went over mechanically to adjust it, pondering his letter all the\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n"Why ever can\'t they hang things where they can be seen?" said he as he\r\ndrew back the curtain.\r\n\r\nThe last words dropped half-spoken from his lips, as he disclosed the\r\nportrait of a certain boy, flashing at him with his reckless eyes, and\r\nhalf-defying him out of the canvas.\r\n\r\nLike Mr Armstrong, when he had encountered the picture a month ago,\r\nRoger Ingleton instinctively guessed in whose presence he stood.\r\n\r\nThe discovery had something in it both of a shock and a disappointment.\r\nIf this was really his elder brother, he was strangely different from\r\nwhat he had in fancy pictured him.  He had imagined him his own age,\r\nwhereas this was a boy considerably his junior.  He had imagined him\r\ndark and grave, whereas this was fair and mocking; and he had imagined\r\nhim amiable and sympathetic, whereas this was hostile and defiant.\r\n\r\nYet, for all that, Roger stood fascinated.  A chord deep in his nature\r\nthrilled as he said to himself, "My brother."  He, the young man, felt\r\nhimself captive to this imperious boy.  He wished he knew the mind of\r\nthe picture, or could hear its voice.  What were the eyes flashing at?\r\nAt whom or what were the lips thus curled?  Was it wickedness, or anger,\r\nor insolence, or all together, that made the face so unlike any other\r\nface he knew?\r\n\r\nHow long he spent over these speculations, half afraid, half enamoured\r\nof the picture, he could not say.  He forgot all about his letter; nor\r\ndid he finally descend from the clouds till a voice behind him said--\r\n\r\n"What have you got there, old fellow?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Armstrong," said the boy, turning round hurriedly, like one\r\ndetected in mischief, "look here at this picture."\r\n\r\nThe tutor was looking.\r\n\r\n"Who is it?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"My elder brother, I\'m sure.  I didn\'t know we had it."\r\n\r\n"There\'s not much family likeness in it," said Mr Armstrong.  "Are you\r\nsure it is he?"\r\n\r\n"I feel positive of it.  Stay, perhaps there\'s something written on the\r\nback," and he lifted the picture from the nail.\r\n\r\nThe paper at the back was almost black with dust and age.  They wiped it\r\ncarefully with a duster, and took it to the window.\r\n\r\n"No," said Roger, "nothing there."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the tutor, "what\'s this?"\r\n\r\nAnd he pointed out a few faint marks in very faded ink, which, after\r\nconsiderable trouble, they deciphered.\r\n\r\n  "R.I., born 3 September 1849, died 186--," (the last figure was\r\n  illegible).\r\n\r\n"That settles it," said Roger, "all except the exact date when he died.\r\nUpon my word, I\'m quite glad it is my brother after all.  I shouldn\'t\r\nhave liked if he\'d turned out any one else."\r\n\r\n"Do you know," added he, as he was about to replace the picture, "I\r\nthink I shall take it up to my room.  I\'ve taken rather a fancy to him."\r\n\r\nThat afternoon the two friends took the train to London, where,\r\nconsiderably to the relief of both, they heard that the "Oriana" was not\r\nexpected in dock for three days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nACQUAINTANCES NEW AND OLD.\r\n\r\nRoger\'s projected jaunt in London did not turn out as satisfactorily as\r\nhe had anticipated, as he caught a heavy cold on the first day, which\r\nkept him a prisoner in his hotel.  Mr Armstrong needed all his\r\nauthority to restrain the invalid within bounds; and it was only by\r\nthreatening to convey him bodily home that the boy consented to nurse\r\nhimself.  Even so, it was as much as he could do to shake off his cold\r\nsufficiently on the morning of the arrival of the "Oriana" to accompany\r\nhis tutor to the Dock to greet his unknown kinsfolk.\r\n\r\nAs he shouldered his way on board over the crowded gangway, he found\r\nhimself speculating somewhat nervously as to which of the numerous\r\npassengers standing about the deck was his new guardian.  Was it the\r\nferocious man with the great black beard who was swearing at his Indian\r\nservant in a voice loud enough to be heard all over the ship?  Or was it\r\nthe dissipated-looking fellow who walked unsteadily across the\r\nmotionless ship, and finally clung for support to the deck railings?  Or\r\nwas it the discontented-looking little person who scowled at the company\r\nat large from the bridge?  Or was it the complacent man with the\r\nexpansive presence and leonine head, who smoked a big cigar and was\r\nexchanging a few effusive farewells with a small group of fellow-\r\nvoyagers?\r\n\r\nRoger accosted one of the stewards--\r\n\r\n"Will you please tell Captain Oliphant that Mr Roger Ingleton is on\r\nboard, with Mr Armstrong, and would like to see him?"\r\n\r\nThe man gave a look up and down and went straight to the expansive\r\nperson before mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe visitors could see the gentleman start a little as the steward\r\ndelivered his message, and pitch his cigar away as, with a serious face,\r\nhe walked in their direction.\r\n\r\n"My poor dear boy," said he, taking Roger\'s hand, "this _is_ good of\r\nyou--very good.  How glad I am to see you!  How is your dear mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Mother is very well.  Have you had a good voyage?  Oh, this is Mr\r\nArmstrong."\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong all this while had been staring through his eye-glass at\r\nhis co-trustee in no very amiable way, and now replied to that\r\ngentleman\'s greeting with a somewhat stiff "How do you do?"  "Where on\r\nearth did I see you before, my gentleman?" said he to himself, and\r\nhaving put the riddle, he promptly gave it up.\r\n\r\nMr Oliphant displayed very little interest in his fellow-guardian, but\r\nsaid to Roger--\r\n\r\n"The children will be so delighted to see you.  We have talked so much\r\nof you.  They will be here directly; they are just putting together\r\ntheir things in the cabin.  But now tell me all about yourself, my boy."\r\n\r\nRoger did not feel equal to this comprehensive task, and said, "I\r\nsuppose you\'ll like to go straight on to Maxfield, wouldn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes!  It may be a day before we get our luggage clear, so we will\r\ncome to your hotel to-night and go on to-morrow.  Why, my boy, what a\r\ncough you have!  Ah! here comes Rosalind."\r\n\r\nThe figure which approached the group was that of a young lady about\r\nseventeen years of age, tall and slim, clad in a loose cloak which\r\nfloated about her like a cloud, and considerably encumbered with sundry\r\nshawls and bags on one arm, a restive dog in another, and a hat which\r\nrefused to remain on her head in the wind.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong was perhaps no great connoisseur of female charms, but he\r\nthought, as he slowly tried to make up his mind whether he should\r\nventure to assist her, that he had rarely seen a more interesting\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nHer face was flushed with the glow of youth and health.  An artist might\r\nhave found fault with it here and there, but to the tutor it seemed\r\ncompletely beautiful.  The fine poise of her head upon the dainty neck,\r\nthe classic cut of mouth and nostril, the large dark liquid eyes, the\r\nsnowy forehead, the short clustering wind-tossed hair, the frank\r\ncountenance, the refinement in every gesture--all combined to astonish\r\nthe good man into admiration.  Yet, with all his admiration, he felt a\r\nlittle afraid of this radiant apparition.  Consequently, by the time he\r\nhad half decided to advance to her succour, his ward had stepped forward\r\nand forestalled him.\r\n\r\n"Let me help you, Cousin Rosalind," said Roger.\r\n\r\nShe turned on him a look half surprise, half pleasure, and then allowing\r\nhim to take cloaks, bags, dog, and all, said--\r\n\r\n"Really, papa, you must go and help down in the cabin.  It\'s an awful\r\nchaos, and Tom and Jill are making it ten times worse.  Do go."  And she\r\nsat down with a gesture of despair on one of the benches, and proceeded\r\nto adjust her unruly hat.  While doing this she looked up at Roger, who\r\nstood meekly before her with her belongings.\r\n\r\n"Thanks!  Don\'t mind holding them; put them down anywhere, Roger, and\r\ndo, there\'s a dear boy, go and help father and the others in that\r\nhorrid, horrid cabin."\r\n\r\nRoger, more flurried and docile than he had felt himself for a long\r\nwhile, dropped the baggage, and thrusting the dog into Armstrong\'s\r\nhands, flew off to obey the behests of his new cousin.\r\n\r\nThe young lady now looked up in charming bewilderment at the tutor, who\r\ncould not fail to read the question in her eyes, and felt called upon to\r\nanswer it.\r\n\r\n"May I introduce myself?" said he.  "I am Frank Armstrong, Roger\'s\r\ntutor."\r\n\r\n"I\'m so glad," said she with a little laugh.  "I\'d imagined you a horrid\r\nelderly person with a white cravat and tortoise-shell spectacles.  It\r\n_is_ such a relief!"\r\n\r\nAnd she sighed at the mere recollection of her forebodings.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no saying what we may become in time," said Mr Armstrong.\r\n\r\n"I suppose," said she, eyeing him curiously once more, "you\'re the other\r\ntrustee, or whatever it\'s called?  I hope you and father will get on\r\nwell.  I can\'t see what use either of you can be.  Roger looks as if he\r\ncould take care of himself.  Are you awfully fond of him?"\r\n\r\n"I am rather," said the tutor in a voice which quite satisfied his\r\nhearer.\r\n\r\n"Heigho!" said she presently, picking up the dog and stroking its ears.\r\n"I\'m glad this dreadful voyage is over.  Mr Armstrong, what do they all\r\nthink about all of us coming to Maxfield?  If I lived there, I should\r\nhate it."\r\n\r\n"Mrs Ingleton, I know, is very pleased."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but you men aren\'t.  There\'ll be fearful rows, I know.  I wish\r\nwe\'d stayed behind in India.  It\'s hateful to be stuck down where you\r\naren\'t wanted, for every one to vote you a nuisance!"\r\n\r\n"I can hardly imagine any one voting _you_ a nuisance," said Mr\r\nArmstrong, half-frightened at his own temerity.\r\n\r\nShe glanced up with a little threatening of a blaze in her eyes.\r\n"Don\'t!" said she.  "That\'s the sort of thing the silly young gentlemen\r\nsay on board ship.  I don\'t like it."\r\n\r\nThe poor tutor winced as much under this rebuff as if he had been just\r\ndetected in a plot to run away with his fair companion; and having\r\nnothing to say in extenuation of his crime, he relapsed into silence.\r\n\r\nMiss Oliphant, apparently unaware of the effect of her little protest,\r\nstroked her dog again and said--\r\n\r\n"Are you an artist?"\r\n\r\n"No; are you?"\r\n\r\n"I want to be.  I\'d give anything to get out of going to Maxfield, and\r\nhave a room here in town near the galleries.  It will be awful waste of\r\ntime in that dull place."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps your father--" began the tutor; but she took him up half\r\nangrily.\r\n\r\n"My father intends us to stay at Maxfield.  In fact, you may as well\r\nknow it at once, and let Roger know it too.  We\'re as poor as church-\r\nmice, and can\'t afford to do anything else.  Oh, how I wish we had\r\nstopped where we were!"  And her voice actually trembled as she said the\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nIt was an uncomfortable position for Mr Armstrong.  Once again his\r\nmother-wit failed him, and he watched the little hand as it moved up and\r\ndown the dog\'s back in silence.\r\n\r\n"I tell you this," continued the young lady, "because tutors are\r\ngenerally poor, and you\'ll understand it.  I wish papa understood it\r\nhalf as well.  I do believe he really enjoys the prospect of going and\r\nlanding himself and all of us at that place."\r\n\r\n"You forget that it is by the desire and invitation of the old Squire,"\r\nsaid the tutor.\r\n\r\n"Father might easily have declined.  He ought to have.  He wasn\'t like\r\nyou, fond of Roger.  He doesn\'t care--at least I fancy he doesn\'t--much\r\nabout Roger at all.  Oh, I wish I could earn enough to pay for every\r\nbite every one of us eats!"\r\n\r\nTo the tutor\'s immense relief, at this point Captain Oliphant\r\nreappeared, followed by Roger with a boy and little girl.\r\n\r\nThe boy was some years the junior of the heir of Maxfield, a rotund,\r\nmatter-of-fact, jovial-looking lad, sturdy in body, easy in temper, and\r\nperhaps by no means brilliant in intellect.  The turmoil of debarkation\r\nfailed to ruffle him, and the information given him in sundry quarters\r\nthat he was the _fons et origo_ of all the confusion in the cabin failed\r\nto impress him.  Everything that befell Tom Oliphant came in the day\'s\r\nwork, and would probably vanish with the night\'s sleep.  Meanwhile it\r\nwas the duty of every one, himself included, to be jolly.  So he\r\naccepted his father\'s chidings and Roger\'s greetings in equally good\r\npart; agreed with every word the former said, and gave in his allegiance\r\nto the latter with one and the same smile, and thought to himself how\r\njolly to be in England at last, and perhaps some day to see the Oxford\r\nand Cambridge boat-race.\r\n\r\nThe little maid who tripped at his side was perhaps ten or eleven--an\r\nodd blending of the sister\'s beauty and alertness with the brother\'s\r\nvigorous contentment.  A prophet, versed in such matters, would have\r\npredicted that ten years hence Miss "Jill" Oliphant might seriously\r\ninterfere with the shape of her elder sister\'s nose.  But as no prophets\r\nwere present, only a fogey like Mr Armstrong and an inexperienced boy\r\nlike Roger, no one concerned themselves about the future, but voted the\r\nlittle lady of ten a winsome child.\r\n\r\n"Well, thanks for all _your_ help," said Tom to his elder sister.  "I\r\ndon\'t know what we should have done without her.  Eh, Roger?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, with _you_ in charge down there," retorted the young\r\nlady, "I wouldn\'t have been safe in that awful place a minute longer.  I\r\nwonder you haven\'t packed up Jill in one of the trunks."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Cousin Roger took care of me," said Miss Jill demurely.\r\n\r\n"I hope Armstrong did the same to you, Rosalind," said Roger.  "Here,\r\nTom; this is my tutor, Frank Armstrong--a brick.  Here, Jill; say how do\r\nyou do to Mr Armstrong."\r\n\r\nJill horrified Mr Armstrong by putting up her face to be kissed.\r\nIndeed the poor gentleman as he shook the glass out of his eye and gazed\r\ndown at this forward young person in consternation, presented so\r\npitiable a spectacle, that Rosalind, Roger, and Tom all began to laugh.\r\n\r\n"She won\'t bite," said Tom reassuringly.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong, thus encouraged, took off his hat, and stooping down,\r\nkissed the child on the brow, much to that little lady\'s satisfaction.\r\nThis important operation performed, Captain Oliphant expressed concern\r\nfor Roger\'s cough, and proposed that his ward should take the girls and\r\nhimself to the hotel, while no doubt Mr Armstrong would not mind\r\nremaining to help Tom with the luggage.  By which excellent arrangement\r\nthe party succeeded at last in getting clear of the "Oriana."\r\n\r\nThe tutor had his hands full most of that morning Tom Oliphant\'s idea of\r\nlooking after the luggage was to put his hands in his pockets and\r\nwhistle pleasantly up and down the upper deck; nor was it till Mr\r\nArmstrong took him bodily below, and made him point out one by one the\r\nfamily properties (among which, by the way, he included several articles\r\nbelonging to other owners), that he could be reduced to business at all.\r\n\r\nThen for half an hour he worked hard; at the end of which time he turned\r\nto his companion with a friendly grin.\r\n\r\n"Thanks awfully, Mr Armstrong.  I say, I wonder if you\'ll be my tutor\r\nas well as Frank\'s?  I heard father say something about it!  Wouldn\'t it\r\nbe stunning?"\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong gave a qualified assent.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not a bit clever, you know, like Rosalind, but I\'d like to have a\r\ntutor awfully.  I say, haven\'t we done enough with these blessed boxes?\r\nThey\'ll be all right now.  Should we have time to see Christy\'s\r\nMinstrels on our way to the hotel, do you think?  I\'d like it\r\nfrightfully."\r\n\r\n"My dear boy," said Mr Armstrong, "if we are to get all the things\r\nproperly cleared and labelled and sent off to Maxfield, we shall have no\r\ntime for anything else.  If the way you stick to your lessons is\r\nanything like the way you stick to this task, I don\'t envy your tutor."\r\n\r\nThis covert threat at once reduced Tom to a sense of discipline, and he\r\nmade a gallant effort to secure Mr Armstrong\'s good opinion.\r\n\r\nThe tutor was right.  It was well on in the afternoon when they had the\r\nbaggage finally disposed of, and were free to follow to the hotel.\r\n\r\nHere they found, instead of the party they expected, a hurriedly\r\nscrawled line from Roger.\r\n\r\n"Dear Armstrong,--\r\n\r\n"Oliphant has taken it into his head to go down to Maxfield at once by\r\nthe two train.  So we are starting.  I\'m sorry he can\'t wait, so as all\r\nto go together.  If you are back in time to come by the evening train,\r\ndo come.  If not, first train in the morning.\r\n\r\n"Yours ever,\r\n\r\n"R.I."\r\n\r\nIt was too late to get a train that day; so Mr Armstrong, much\r\ndisgusted, had to make up his mind to remain.  Tom, on the contrary, was\r\ndelighted, and proposed twenty different plans for spending the evening,\r\nwhich finally resolved themselves into the coveted visit to Christy\'s\r\nMinstrels.\r\n\r\nThe tutor, in no very festive humour, allowed himself to be overborne by\r\nthe eagerness of his young companion, and found himself in due time\r\njammed into a seat in a very hot hall, listening to the very\r\nmiscellaneous performance of the coloured gentlemen who "never perform\r\nout of London."\r\n\r\nThe tutor, who had some ideas of his own on the subject of music,\r\nlistened very patiently, sometimes pleased, sometimes distressed, and\r\nalways conscious of the enthusiastic delight of his companion, whose\r\nunaffected comments formed to him the most amusing part of the\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t that, stunning?"\r\n\r\n"Thanks awfully, Mr Armstrong, for bringing me."\r\n\r\n"Hooray!  Bones again!"\r\n\r\n"I say, I\'m looking forward to the break-down; ain\'t you?" and so on.\r\n\r\nWhatever Mr Armstrong\'s anticipations may have been as to the rapture\r\nof the coming "break-down," he contained himself admirably, and with his\r\nglass inquiringly stuck in his eye, listened attentively to all that\r\nwent on, and occasionally speculated as to how Miss Rosalind Oliphant\r\nwas enjoying her visit to Maxfield.\r\n\r\nThe programme was half over, and Tom was repairing the ravages of nature\r\nwith a bun, when Mr Armstrong became suddenly aware of a person in the\r\nrow but one in front looking round fixedly in his direction.\r\n\r\nTo judge by the close-cropped, erect hair and stubbly chin of this\r\nsomewhat disreputable-looking individual, he was a foreigner; and when\r\npresently, catching the tutor\'s eye, he began to indulge in pantomimic\r\ngestures of recognition, it was safe to guess he was a Frenchman.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s that chap nodding to you?" said Tom with his mouth full.  "Is he\r\ntipsy?"\r\n\r\n"He lays himself open to the suspicion," said Mr Armstrong slowly.  "At\r\nany rate, as I vote we go put and get some fresh air, he will have to\r\nfind some one else to make faces at.  Come along."\r\n\r\nTom did not at all like risking his seat, and particularly charged the\r\nlady next to him to preserve it from invasion at the risk of her life.\r\n\r\nThen wondering a little at Mr Armstrong\'s impatience to reach the fresh\r\nair, he followed him out.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman witnessed the proceeding with some little disappointment,\r\nand sat craning his neck in the direction in which they had gone for\r\nsome minutes.  Then, as if moved by a similar yearning for fresh air, he\r\ntoo left his seat and went out.\r\n\r\nThe band was beginning to play as he did so, and most of the loiterers\r\nwere crowding back for the second part.\r\n\r\n"You go in; I\'ll come directly," said Mr Armstrong to the boy.\r\n\r\nTom needed no second invitation, and a moment later had forgotten\r\neverything in the delightful prelude to the "break-down."  He did not\r\neven observe that Mr Armstrong had not returned to his seat.\r\n\r\n"Well, Gustav," said that gentleman in French as the foreigner\r\napproached him, where he waited in the outer lobby.\r\n\r\n"_Eh bien, man cher_," replied the other, "\'ow \'appy I am to see you.  I\r\ncan speak ze Englise foine, _n\'est ce pas_?"\r\n\r\n"What are you doing in London?"\r\n\r\n"I am vaiter, _garcon_ at ze private hotel.  \'Zey give me foods and\r\ndrinks and one black coat, but not no vage.  _Oh, mon ami_, it is ver\'\r\nver\' \'ard."\r\n\r\n"And the old man?"\r\n\r\n"_Ah, helas_! he is ver\' ver\' ill.  He vill die next week.  _Moi_, I can\r\nnot to him go; and Marie, she write me she must leave Paris this day to\r\nher duties.  It is sad for the poor old _pere_ to die with not von\r\nfriend to \'old \'is \'and.  Ah! if ze petite Francoise yet lived, _ma\r\npauvre enfant_, she would stay and--"\r\n\r\n"Stop!" said the tutor imperatively.  "Is he still in the old place?"\r\n\r\n"_Helas_, non! you make ze joke, you.  Ve are ver\' ver\' poor, and \'ave\r\nno homes.  _Mon pere_, he is to the hopital.  Thank \'eaven, they \'ave\r\nzere give \'im ze bed to die."\r\n\r\n"Which hospital is he at?" said the tutor.\r\n\r\n"De Saint Luc."\r\n\r\n"I will see him."\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman gave a little hysterical laugh; then, with tears in his\r\neyes, he seized the hand of the Englishman and wrung it rapturously.\r\n\r\n"_Oh, mon ami, mon cher ami_!" cried he, "\'eaven will bless you.  I am\r\n\'appy that you say that.  You vill see \'im?  Yes?  You vill \'old \'is\r\n\'and ven he do die?  He sall have one friend to kiss his poor _front_?\r\nOh, I am content; I am gay."\r\n\r\nHow long he would have gone on thus it is hard to say.  Mr Armstrong\r\ncut short the scene rather abruptly.\r\n\r\n"There, there!" said he.  "Good-bye, Gustav.  I shall go very soon, and\r\nwill come and see you when I return."  And he went back to the\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve missed it!" said Tom, as he dropped into his seat.  "It was the\r\nfinest `break-down\' you ever saw!  That one next but one to Bones kept\r\nit up best.  We couldn\'t get an encore out of them.  Never mind; perhaps\r\nthey\'ll have another to finish up.  There\'s lot\'s more in the\r\nprogramme."\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong watched it all with the same critical interest as before,\r\nbut his mind was far away.  It wandered to the foreign city, to the\r\ngaunt pauper hospital there, to a little low bed where lay an old dying\r\nfriendless man, tossing and moaning for the laggard death to give him\r\nrest.  He saw nothing of what went on before him; he felt none of the\r\nmerry boy\'s nudges at his side; he even forgot Roger and Maxfield.\r\n\r\nThe performance was over at last.\r\n\r\n"Well, that _was_ a jolly spree!  I wish it was coming all over again,"\r\nchirped the boy.  "Oh, thank you awfully, Mr Armstrong, for bringing\r\nme.  Did you like it too?  That last break-down wasn\'t up to the other,\r\nbut I\'m glad you\'ve seen one of them, at any rate."\r\n\r\nAs they crowded out, Mr Armstrong was surprised and a little vexed to\r\nsee Gustav still hanging about the lobby waiting for him.  He dropped\r\nbehind the boy for a moment and beckoned him.\r\n\r\n"Well, Gustav?" said he impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Ah, _mon ami_," said the Frenchman, putting a little bunch of early\r\nviolets into the tutor\'s hands, "vill you give \'im zese from me?  \'Tis\r\nall I can send.  But he will love zem for the sake of me and ze little\r\nFrancoise.  Adieu, adieu, _mon cher ami_."\r\n\r\nIt took not a minute; but in that time Tom had wandered serenely on,\r\nnever dreaming that his protector was not close at his heels.  Nor did\r\nhe discover his mistake till he found himself half-way up Piccadilly,\r\nenlarging to a stranger at his side on the excellence of the evening\'s\r\nperformance.  Then he looked round and missed his companion.  The\r\npavement was crowded with wayfarers of all sorts, some pressing one way,\r\nsome another.  Among them all the boy could not discover the stalwart\r\nform of Mr Armstrong.  He pushed back to the hall, but he was not\r\nthere.  He followed one or two figures that looked like his; but they\r\nwere strangers all.  Then he returned up the street at a run, hoping to\r\novertake him; but in vain.\r\n\r\nHe knew nothing of London; he did not even know the name of the hotel;\r\nhe had no money in his pocket.\r\n\r\nHe was, in short, lost.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr Armstrong, not seeing his charge at the door, he had started\r\nto run in the direction of the hotel, which was the opposite direction\r\nto that taken by Tom.  Seeing no sign of the prodigal, he too returned\r\nto the hall, just after Tom had started a second time on the contrary\r\ntack; and so for an hour these two played hide and seek; sometimes\r\nalmost within reach of one another; at others, with the whole length of\r\nthe street between them.\r\n\r\nAt last the crowd on the pavement thinned, and the tutor, sorely\r\nchagrined, started off to the hotel, on the chance of the boy having\r\nturned up there.  No Tom was there.  Tom, in fact, was at that moment\r\ndebating somewhere about a mile and a half away whether he should not\r\ntry to make his way to the "Oriana" at the Docks, and remain quietly\r\nthere till claimed.  What a joke it would all be when he _was_ found!\r\nWhat an adventure for his first night in London!\r\n\r\nIt was not very easy even for Tom Oliphant to derive much amusement from\r\nthese philosophical reflections, and he looked about him rather dismally\r\nfor some one of whom to inquire his way.\r\n\r\nA seedy-looking person was standing under a lamppost hard by, trying to\r\nlight a cigarette in the wind.  Tom decided to tackle him.\r\n\r\n"Please can you tell me the way to the Docks where the P and O steamers\r\ncome in?" said he.\r\n\r\nThe man let drop his match and stared at the boy.\r\n\r\n"Vy," said he with an odd shrug, "that is some long walks from here.\r\n_Mais, comment_.  Vas you not at ze Christy Minstrel to-night viz a nice\r\ngentleman?"\r\n\r\n"Rather!" said the boy.  "Were you there?  I say, wasn\'t it a clipping\r\nturn out?  I did like it, especially the break-down.  I say, I\'m lost.\r\nThe fellow who was looking after me has lost me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you \'ave lost \'im.  I am \'appy you to find.  You sall not valk to\r\nze Dock, no.  I sall give you sleeps at ze hotel, and to-morrow you sall\r\nfind zat dear gentleman.  Come wiz me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but you know, he\'ll be looking for me; besides, I\'ve got no tin.\r\nFather forgot to leave me any.  I\'d better go to the Docks, I say."\r\n\r\n"You sall not.  Zey will be all shut fast zere.  No, my dear friend, you\r\nsall come sleep at my hotel, and you sall have nothings to pay.  It will\r\nbe all right.  I would die for to help ze friend of my friend."\r\n\r\n"Is Mr Armstrong a friend of yours?" asked the boy.  "I thought you\r\nwere only cheeking him that time in the Hall.  Oh, all right, if you\r\nknow him.  Thanks awfully."\r\n\r\nGustav, as delighted as a cat who has found her kitten, led the boy off\r\njubilantly to his third-rate hotel off the Strand, taking the\r\nprecaution, as he passed, to leave word at the Hall that if a gentleman\r\ncalled who had lost a boy, he should be told where he would find him.\r\n\r\nHe smuggled Tom up to his own garret, and made him royally welcome with\r\nthree-quarters of his scanty supper and the whole of his narrow bed,\r\nsleeping himself on the floor cheerfully for the sake of the _cher ami_\r\nwho had that night promised to go to Paris to hold the hand of his dying\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nAbout three in the morning there was a loud ringing of the bell and a\r\nsound of steps and voices on the stairs, and presently Mr Armstrong\r\nentered the room.\r\n\r\nGustav sprang up with his finger on his lips, pointing to the sleeping\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n"Oh, _mon ami_," whispered he, "\'ow \'appy I am you \'ave found \'im.  But\r\nI keep him ver\' safe.  I love to do it, for you are ver\' good to me and\r\nthe _pauvre pere_.  He sall rest here till to-day, vile you (helas! that\r\nI have no two beds to offer you), you sall take one in ze hotel, and at\r\nmorning we sall all be \'appy together."\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong grimly accepted this proposal, and took a room for the\r\nnight at Gustav\'s hotel.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, scarcely waiting to take breakfast or bid another\r\nadieu to his grateful friend, he hurried the genial Tom, who had enjoyed\r\nhimself extremely, to the station, and carried him down by express train\r\nto Maxfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nA CHURCHYARD COUGH.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Armstrong with his jovial charge arrived about midday at\r\nMaxfield, he was struck with the transformation scene which had taken\r\nplace since he quitted it gloomily a day or two before.\r\n\r\nThe house was the same, the furniture was untouched, the ordinary\r\ndomestic routine appeared to be unaltered, but a sense of something new\r\npervaded the place which he could interpret only by the one word--\r\nOliphant.\r\n\r\nThe captain had made a touching entry--full of sympathy, full of\r\naffection, full of a desire to spare his dear cousin all business worry,\r\nfull of the responsibility that was on him to take charge of the dear\r\nfatherless boy, full of that calm sense of duty which enables a man to\r\nassert himself on all occasions for the good of those committed to his\r\ncare.  As for his charming daughters, they had floated majestically into\r\ntheir quarters--Miss Rosalind a trifle defiantly, making no secret of\r\nher dislike of the whole business; Miss Jill merrily, delighted with the\r\nnovelty and beauty of this new home, so much more to her mind than the\r\nbarrack home in India.  And Roger, despite all his sinister\r\nanticipations, found himself tolerant already of the new guardian, and\r\nmore than tolerant of his _suite_.\r\n\r\nFor somehow his pulses had taken to beating a little quicker since\r\nyesterday, and when half a dozen times that evening he had heard a\r\nsummons down the landing to come and hang this picture, or like a dear\r\nboy unfasten that strap, or like an angel come and make himself\r\nagreeable, unless he intended his cousins to sit by themselves all the\r\nevening as penance for coming where they were not wanted,--at all such\r\nsummonses Roger Ingleton had experienced quite a novel sensation of\r\nnervousness and awkwardness, which contributed to make him very\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\n"Why," said he, as he and his tutor greeted one another again in Mr\r\nArmstrong\'s room, "why, it seems ages since I saw you, and yet it\'s only\r\nyesterday.  I wish we could all have come down together.  Do you know,\r\nArmstrong, I half fancy it\'s not going to be as awful as I expected."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right," said Mr Armstrong, who had already begun to\r\nentertain a contrary impression.\r\n\r\n"Oliphant seems civilly disposed, and not inclined to interfere; and the\r\ngirls--well they seem harmless enough.  How do you like Tom?"\r\n\r\n"Tom\'s a nice, quiet, business-like boy," said the tutor with a grin.\r\n"I\'ll tell you more about him soon, but at present I have no time.  I\r\nmust catch the four o\'clock train back to London."\r\n\r\n"What!  What ever for?" exclaimed Roger, with falling face.\r\n\r\n"Urgent private affairs.  I shall be away perhaps a week," said Mr\r\nArmstrong shortly, in a tone which discouraged Roger from making further\r\ninquiries.\r\n\r\n"I\'m awfully sorry," said he; "I shall miss you specially just now."\r\n\r\n"If I could have taken any other time, I would," said the tutor, busily\r\nthrowing his things into his bag all the time; "but I am going to a\r\ndeath-bed."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Armstrong, I\'m so sorry.  Is it a relation?"\r\n\r\n"As I regard relations, yes.  Now I must go and make my apologies to\r\nyour mother.  I\'ll come and see you before I go."\r\n\r\nHe found the lady sitting in the library in consultation with Captain\r\nOliphant.  The table was spread with the late Squire\'s papers and\r\ndocuments, concerning which the Captain was evincing considerable\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe tutor glared a little through his glass at the spectacle of this\r\nindustry, and disposing of his co-trustee\'s greeting with a half nod,\r\naccosted Mrs Ingleton.\r\n\r\n"I must ask you to excuse me for a few days, Mrs Ingleton.  I have just\r\nreceived news which render a journey necessary."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" said Captain Oliphant, looking up from his papers.  "I am\r\nafraid, Mr Armstrong, we must ask you to postpone it, as there are a\r\ngood many business matters of importance to be gone into, which will\r\nrequire the attention of all the trustees.  It is an inconvenient time\r\nto seek for leave of absence."\r\n\r\nThe tutor\'s mouth stiffened ominously.\r\n\r\n"You take unnecessary interest in my affairs, sir.  I shall be at your\r\nservice on my return.  Mrs Ingleton, I am sorry for this interruption\r\nin Roger\'s studies.  It shall be as brief as I can make it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course, Mr Armstrong," said the lady, "I hope it is nothing\r\nserious.  We shall be glad to have you back to consult about things;\r\nthat is all Captain Oliphant means, I\'m sure."\r\n\r\nThe tutor bowed.\r\n\r\n"I really hope," said Captain Oliphant blandly, "Mr Armstrong will\r\nappreciate my desire to cooperate harmoniously in the sacred trust laid\r\nupon us all by the dying wish of our dear friend."\r\n\r\n"I have no wish to do anything else, sir," said the tutor shortly, "if\r\nyou will allow me.  Good-bye, Mrs Ingleton."\r\n\r\nRoger was a good deal concerned to notice the grim cloud on his friend\'s\r\nface, when he returned for a moment to his room for his bag.  He knew\r\nhim too well to ask questions, but made up for his silence by the warmth\r\nof his farewell.\r\n\r\n"Come back soon, Armstrong; it will be awfully slow while you\'re away.\r\nLet\'s carry your bag down-stairs."\r\n\r\nAs they passed the end of the lobby, a certain door chanced to open, and\r\nArmstrong caught a vision of an easel and a fair head beyond, and beyond\r\nthat a mantelpiece decorated with all sorts of Oriental and feminine\r\nknick-knacks.  He might have observed more had his glass been up, and\r\nhad he not been eagerly accosted by Miss Jill, who just then was running\r\nout of the room.\r\n\r\n"Mr Armstrong!  Mr Armstrong!" shouted she in glee.  "Rosalind, he\'s\r\ncome back; here he is!"\r\n\r\nAnd without more ado she caught the embarrassed tutor by the arm and\r\ndemanded a kiss.  He compromised feebly by patting her head, whereat\r\nMiss Jill pouted.\r\n\r\n"You\'re more unkind than yesterday," she said; "you kissed me then."\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t ask Mr Armstrong to do horrid things," said Miss\r\nRosalind, coming to the door.\r\n\r\nThe tutor, very hot and flurried, replied to this cruel challenge by\r\nsaluting the little tyrant and bowing to her sister.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you come in and see the studio?" said the latter.  "It\'s a little\r\nless dreadful than yesterday, thanks to Roger.  What are you carrying\r\nthat bag for, Roger?"\r\n\r\n"Armstrong\'s going up to town for a few days."\r\n\r\n"How horrid!" said Miss Rosalind, with vexation in her voice; "just\r\nwhile Jill and I are feeling so lonely, cooped up here like nuns, with\r\nnot a soul to talk to, and knowing we\'re in everybody\'s way."\r\n\r\n"Armstrong has a sad enough reason for going," said Roger; "but I say,\r\nit\'s not very complimentary to me to say you\'ve not a soul to talk to."\r\n\r\nThe half-jesting petulance in Rosalind\'s face had given place to a look\r\nalmost of pain as she held out her hand.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Mr Armstrong," said she.  "I didn\'t know you were in\r\ntrouble."\r\n\r\n"It _will_ be jolly when you come home," chimed in Jill.\r\n\r\nSomehow in Mr Armstrong\'s ears, as he whirled along to town that\r\nafternoon, those two pretty farewells rang continuous changes.  When, at\r\nevening, he took his seat in the Dover express, they still followed him,\r\nnow in solos, now in duet, now in restless fugue.  On the steamer they\r\nrose and fell with the uneasy waves and played in the whistling wind.\r\nAs he sped towards Paris, past the acacia hedges and poplar avenues,\r\namong foreign scenes, amidst the chatter of foreign tongues, surrounded\r\nby foreign faces, he still caught the sound of those two distant\r\nvoices--one quiet and low, the other gay and piping; and even when, at\r\nlast, he dropped asleep and forgot everything else, they joined in with\r\nthe rattle of the rail to give him his lullaby.  Such are the freaks of\r\nwhich a sensitive musical ear is often the victim.\r\n\r\nAt Maxfield, meanwhile, he remained in the minds of one or two of the\r\ninmates.\r\n\r\nThe two young ladies, assisted by their cousin, and genially obstructed\r\nby their easy-going brother, proceeded seriously in the task of adorning\r\nthe studio; now and then speculating about the absent tutor, and now and\r\nthen feeling very dejected and lonely.  Roger did his best to enliven\r\nthe evening and make his visitors feel at home.  But although Tom and\r\nJill readily consented to be comforted, Miss Rosalind as stubbornly\r\nrefused, and protested a score of times that the cabin of the "Oriana"\r\nitself was preferable to the misery of being condemned, as she termed\r\nit, to eat her head off in this dismal place.  She was sorry for Mr\r\nArmstrong, but she was vexed too that he should go off the very first\r\nday after her arrival, and leave her to fight her battles alone.  After\r\nthat talk on the steamer, she had, in her own mind, reckoned on him as\r\nan ally, and it disappointed her not to find him at her bidding after\r\nall.\r\n\r\nBut she was not the only person whose mind was exercised by the tutor\'s\r\nabrupt exodus.\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant felt decidedly hurt by the manner of his going.  It\r\nargued a lack of appreciation of the newly arrived trustee\'s position in\r\nthe household on which he had hardly calculated; and it bespoke a spirit\r\nof independence in the tutor himself, which his colleague could not but\r\nregard as unpromising.  Indeed, when, after the day\'s labours, Captain\r\nOliphant sought the seclusion of his own apartment, this amiable,\r\npleasant-spoken gentleman grew quite warm with himself.\r\n\r\n"Who is this grandee?" he asked himself.  "A man hired at a few pounds a\r\nyear and fed at the Maxfield table, in order to help the heir to a\r\nlittle quite unnecessary knowledge of the ancient classics and modern\r\nsciences.  What was the old dotard,"--the old dotard, by the way, was\r\nCaptain Oliphant\'s private manner of referring to the lamented "dear\r\none," whose name so often trembled on his lips in public,--"what was the\r\nold dotard thinking about?  At any rate, I should like to know a little\r\nmore about the fellow myself."\r\n\r\nWith this laudable intention he questioned Mrs Ingleton next morning.\r\n\r\n"He is a good friend to dear Roger," said the mother.  "Roger is devoted\r\nto him.  I am sure you will get to like him, Edward.  He is perhaps a\r\nlittle odd in his manner, but he has a good heart."\r\n\r\nThis was about all Mrs Ingleton knew, except that he was a University\r\nman and an accomplished musician.\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant was not much enlightened by this description.  He sat\r\ndown, and for the third time carefully read over the "dear one\'s" will.\r\n\r\n"I think," said he at lunch-time, "I will stroll over to Yeld this\r\nafternoon and see Mr Pottinger.  Roger, will you walk with me?  A walk\r\nwould do you good.  You are looking pale, my boy."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m all right," said Roger, whose cough, however, was still\r\nobstinate.  "I\'ll come with pleasure."\r\n\r\nA walk of five miles on a damp afternoon through drenched country lanes\r\nmay be a good specific for a cough in India, but in England it\r\noccasionally fails in this respect.  Roger was wet through when he\r\nreached Yeld.\r\n\r\n"I shall not be long," said the Captain as they reached the attorney\'s\r\ndoor.  "Don\'t catch cold, there\'s a good fellow.  Remember your health\r\nis very precious."\r\n\r\nRoger undertook to act on this considerate advice, and occupied his time\r\nof waiting by strolling up and down the High Street in the rain, paying\r\na call here and there at one or two shops, and finally dropping in to\r\nsee his friend Dr Brandram.\r\n\r\nThe Captain meanwhile was having an interesting chat with the attorney.\r\n\r\nAfter introducing himself and receiving the suitable congratulations, he\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"Mr Ingleton\'s will, Mr Pottinger, so far as I can understand it,\r\nseems fairly simple, and I am ready and anxious to perform my part of\r\nits provisions."\r\n\r\n"Yes.  You see, after all, it is only a matter of two years\' trouble.\r\nAs soon as Master Roger comes of age you will be released."\r\n\r\n"Unless," says the Captain, laughing, "he marries, becomes mad, or goes\r\nto prison, isn\'t that it?  What a curious proviso!"\r\n\r\n"It is.  The old Squire had his peculiarities, like most of us.  He set\r\nhis heart on this boy turning out well."\r\n\r\n"Ah!  I presume this tutor, Mr Armstrong, has very high qualifications,\r\nsince so much depends on him."\r\n\r\n"Of that I can\'t say, Captain Oliphant.  To tell you the truth, I never\r\nquite understood that appointment.  But doubtless the Squire knew best."\r\n\r\n"Doubtless.  He must have had a very high opinion of him to associate\r\nhim with Mrs Ingleton and me in the guardianship.  I take it, by the\r\nway, that hardly extends beyond his present duties as tutor."\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it," said Mr Pottinger.  "According to the will, he has\r\nthe right to participate in every action taken by the other trustees,\r\neither as regards the boy, or the estate, or anything else."\r\n\r\n"How very singular!  You don\'t mean to say that he is to be consulted in\r\nmatters of finance or the management of the property?"\r\n\r\n"Technically, yes--if he claims it.  I imagine, however, he is hardly\r\naware of this, and I am not inclined to urge him to claim it.  I should\r\nbe sorry to give you an unfavourable impression, Captain Oliphant, but I\r\ndo not like this Mr Armstrong."\r\n\r\n"He appears to be well thought of at Maxfield," said the Captain.\r\n\r\n"My private opinion is--but you must not let it influence you--that he\r\nis somewhat of an adventurer.  I know nothing of his antecedents."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! not even where he lives?"\r\n\r\n"No; the Squire was reticent on the matter.  He told me he had good\r\nrecommendations with him, and that he was an Oxford man."\r\n\r\n"Surely that should be satisfactory.  I hope we shall find him not\r\ndifficult to get on with, after all.  We shall have to wait a week or\r\nso, however, before putting the question to the test, as he has just\r\ngone off rather abruptly, and at this particular time rather\r\ninopportunely, on a journey, for what object I do not know."\r\n\r\n"Humph!" said the attorney.  "I do not like mysteries.  However, I trust\r\nit will be as you say."\r\n\r\nDr Brandram, when presently the Captain called in for his ward, was in\r\nby no means a good temper.\r\n\r\n"I have been blowing Roger up sky-high," said he, puffing his smoke\r\nrather viciously in the Captain\'s direction, "for behaving like a\r\nlunatic.  The idea of his coming out and getting himself wet through\r\nwith this cold upon him."\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear!" said the Captain; "has he got wet through?  Why, my dear\r\nboy, what did I tell you?"\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t have let him come," said the doctor bluntly.  "He\'s no\r\nbusiness to play tricks with himself."\r\n\r\n"Really, doctor," said Roger, laughing and coughing alternately, "I\'m\r\nnot a baby."\r\n\r\n"You\'re worse," said the doctor severely.  "Don\'t let it happen again.\r\nYou must go home in a fly; I won\'t allow you to walk.  Armstrong\r\nwouldn\'t have let you do it."\r\n\r\nIt grated on the Captain\'s nerves to hear the tutor thus quoted in what\r\nseemed to be a reflection on himself.\r\n\r\n"Roger, my boy," said he, "you are fortunate to have somebody to look\r\nwell after you.  I quite agree with the doctor; we must drive home.  I\r\nhope your things are dry."\r\n\r\n"He\'s made me change everything I had on," said Roger.\r\n\r\n"Quite right--quite right!"\r\n\r\nThe doctor took an opportunity before the fly arrived of talking to the\r\nCaptain seriously about his ward\'s health.\r\n\r\n"He\'s not robust, you can see that yourself," said he, "and he won\'t\r\ntake care of himself, that\'s equally evident.  You must make him do it,\r\nor I won\'t answer for the consequences."\r\n\r\nThe Captain laughed pleasantly.  "My duties grow on me apace," said he.\r\n"I have come over from India to look after his morals, his estate, his\r\neducation, and now I find I must add to them the oversight of--"\r\n\r\n"Of his flannels.  Certainly; see they are well aired, that\'s more\r\nimportant than any of the others.  Good-bye!"\r\n\r\nThe Maxfield household was a dismal one that evening.  Mrs Ingleton in\r\ndistress had prevailed on Roger to go to bed.  Miss Rosalind, defrauded\r\nin one day of her two allies, sulked in a dignified way in her own room,\r\nand visited her displeasure with the world in general on poor Jill, who\r\nconsoled herself by beginning a letter to her "dear Mr Armstrong."\r\nTom, having wandered joyously over the whole house, making friends with\r\neverybody and admiring everything, was engaged in the feverish\r\noccupation of trying to find his stamp album, which he had left behind\r\nin India.\r\n\r\nThe only serene member of the party was Captain Oliphant, who in the\r\narm-chair of the library smoked an excellent cigar and ruminated on\r\nthings at large.\r\n\r\n"Poor lad!" said he to himself, "great pity he\'s so delicate.  Not at\r\nall a pleasant cough--quite a churchyard tone about it.  Tut! tut!  I\'m\r\nnot favourably impressed with that doctor; an officious bumpkin, he\r\nseems to me.  And this Armstrong--I should really like to know a little\r\nmore about him.  Pottinger was decidedly of my way of thinking.  Not a\r\nnice fellow at all, Armstrong.  Wrong sort of companion for Roger.  Poor\r\nfellow! how he\'s coughing to-night."\r\n\r\nAnd this kindly soul actually laid down his cigar and went out into the\r\npassage to listen.\r\n\r\n"Shocking cough," said he as he returned and relit his cigar.  Then he\r\ntook out a document from his pocket--a copy of the will, in fact--and\r\nread it again.  Which done, he relapsed into genial meditation ones\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nPresently his kindly feelings prompted him to pay his ward a visit.\r\n\r\n"Well, my boy, how are you?  Better, I hope."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said Roger, coughing; "it\'s only a cold in my head.  I\'ll\r\nsoon be all right.  I\'m awfully sorry to desert the girls and Tom, tell\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"Nothing I can do for you, is there?"\r\n\r\n"Thanks very much.  I\'m all right.  I shall get to sleep pretty soon.\r\nGood night, Cousin Edward."\r\n\r\n"Good night, dear boy.  Another time you must take better care of\r\nyourself.  Remember your life is precious to us all."\r\n\r\nWith these affectionate words Captain Oliphant left the room, candle in\r\nhand.  As he passed his daughter\'s boudoir he looked in.  It was empty.\r\nThe young ladies had long since taken refuge in their bedroom.  All the\r\nhouse, in fact, except Captain Oliphant, had done the same.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman, as he passed another door which stood half open, could\r\nnot resist a friendly impulse to peep in.  It was a snug room, with a\r\npiano in one corner, and foils, boxing gloves, Oxford prints, and other\r\ntokens of a bachelor proprietorship displayed on the walls.  The table\r\nwas littered with classical exercises, music scores, and letters.  A\r\ncollege boating-jacket hung behind the door, and one or two prize-\r\ngoblets decorated the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant displayed a genial interest in everything.  He read the\r\ninscriptions on the goblets, glanced casually through the papers, read\r\nthe addresses on a few of the letters, and generally took stock of the\r\napartment.  Of course, like an honourable gentleman, he disturbed\r\nnothing, and presently, distressed by a sudden fit of coughing from the\r\ndirection of his ward\'s room, he hastily stepped out into the lobby\r\nagain and made his way back to the library.\r\n\r\nBefore he went to bed this methodical person committed three several\r\nmatters to paper.  In his memorandum-book he wrote the name of a certain\r\ncollege at Oxford, and a date, corresponding, oddly enough, to the name\r\nand date on one of the goblets in Mr Armstrong\'s room.\r\n\r\nThat done, he scrawled a post card to Dr Brandram, requesting him to\r\ncall and see Roger, whose cough was still a little troublesome.\r\n\r\nAfter that, he pulled out of his pocket and read with a somewhat pained\r\nexpression a letter he had received the day before by the Indian mail.\r\nIt was gather long, but the passage which pained Captain Oliphant\r\nparticularly ran thus:--\r\n\r\n  "The trouble about the mess accounts is not blown over yet.  I have\r\n  done what I can for you.  I hope you will make it unnecessary for me\r\n  to enter into details with the parties chiefly interested in that\r\n  affair.  It depends pretty much on what you are able to tell me,\r\n  whether I can give you the time you mention in your last.  You will\r\n  consult your own interests best by being quite square," and so on.\r\n\r\nThe expression which Captain Oliphant mentally applied to the writer as\r\nhe re-read this pleasant passage was not wholly flattering, and his\r\ncountenance, as I have said, bore traces of considerable pain.  However,\r\nafter a little meditation it cleared somewhat, and he wrote:--\r\n\r\n  "It seems to me a pity you should take up a position which can only\r\n  end in trouble all round.  You know how things stand, and how\r\n  impossible it is to hasten matters.  At the present moment there seems\r\n  every probability of my being able to discharge all my accounts--yours\r\n  among them--considerably earlier than the time first mentioned.  It is\r\n  worth your while, under the circumstances, reconsidering what, you\r\n  must allow me to say, is a preposterous claim for interest.  Of\r\n  course, if you charge me for the full term, I have very little\r\n  inducement to settle up sooner.  Turn it over, like a sensible man,\r\n  and believe me, meanwhile,\r\n\r\n  "Yours truly,\r\n\r\n  "E.O.\r\n\r\n  "_P.S_.--I enclose a copy of the clauses of the will most likely to\r\n  interest you.  I am sorry to say my ward is in very bad--I might say\r\n  seriously bad--health.  He has a constitutional complaint, which, I\r\n  greatly fear, will make this winter a most anxious time to us all."\r\n\r\nAfter this, Captain Oliphant soothed himself down with a cigarette, and\r\nspent a little time in admiring contemplation of an excellent portrait\r\nof Mrs Ingleton on the wall.  Finally, he went cheerfully to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nA CASE OF EVICTION.\r\n\r\nA week passed and Mr Armstrong did not return.  By the end of that time\r\nMiss Rosalind Oliphant, for better or worse, had settled down into her\r\nnew quarters, and made herself as much at home as a fair Bohemian can do\r\nanywhere.  She still resented the fate which brought her to Maxfield at\r\nall, and annoyed her father constantly by casting their dependence on\r\nthe hospitality of the place in his teeth.\r\n\r\n"I wish you had some business, father," said she, "so that we could pay\r\nour way.  I don\'t suppose my pictures will ever sell, but every penny I\r\nearn shall go to Roger.  Couldn\'t we go and live in the lodge, somewhere\r\nwhere we can--"\r\n\r\n"Rosalind," said her father, "you vex me by talking like a child.  After\r\nthe education I have tried to provide for you, I had a right to hope you\r\nwould at least regulate your tongue by a little common-sense.  Do you\r\nnot know that I have given up my profession, everything, in order to\r\ncome to do my duty here?"\r\n\r\n"I wish you hadn\'t," said the girl doggedly; "it would have been so easy\r\nto decline the trust and remain independent.  It\'s awful to think we\'ve\r\nnothing to live on but what we get out of Roger\'s money."\r\n\r\n"Foolish girl," said her father with a forced laugh, "you are a\r\ndelightful specimen of a woman\'s incapacity to understand the very\r\nrudiments of business.  Why, you absurd child, old Roger Ingleton\'s will\r\nbequeathed me L300 a year for acting as the boy\'s guardian."\r\n\r\n"Yes, for two years.  And Roger would have been all that richer if you\'d\r\ndeclined.  I\'m sure his mother and Mr Armstrong are plenty to look\r\nafter him.  I\'d have liked you so much better, dear father, if you\'d\r\nstayed in the army."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid, my poor girl, it is useless to argue with you.  When you do\r\nget a wrong idea into your head, nothing will induce you to part with\r\nit, even if it involves an injustice to your poor father."\r\n\r\n"Father," said she, "you know it is because I love you and--"\r\n\r\n"Enough," said he rather sternly.  "I know you mean well."\r\n\r\nAnd he went.\r\n\r\nAt the door, however, he returned and said--\r\n\r\n"By the way, Rosalind, I must mention one matter; not for discussion,\r\nbut as my express wish.  You named Mr Armstrong just now.  I desire\r\nthat you hold no communication with him.  I have reason for knowing he\r\nis not a desirable person at all."\r\n\r\n"If so, you had better take us away from here," said Rosalind, flushing.\r\n"You\'ve no right to let us stay."\r\n\r\n"Silence, miss, and bear in mind what I tell you.  Do you understand?"\r\n\r\nRosalind had taken up her brush and was painting furiously at her\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant having waited a minute for an answer and getting none,\r\nstalked out of the room a model of parental anguish.  As for Miss\r\nRosalind, she painted away for a quarter of an hour, and then said to\r\nherself--\r\n\r\n"Is he?"\r\n\r\nWith which profound inquiry she laid down her brush and went to visit\r\nher invalid cousin.\r\n\r\nRoger was up, though still coughing, and ensconced in his study.\r\n\r\n"How jolly of you to come!" said he.\r\n\r\n"I came because I\'d nothing else to do," said she, "I\'m not jolly at\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"Why, what\'s the row?"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you guess?  Don\'t you know that I owe you already for a week\'s\r\nboard and lodgings and haven\'t earned sixpence to pay you."\r\n\r\n"I shall put you in the county court," said Roger solemnly.\r\n\r\n"It\'s no joke to me," said she.\r\n\r\n"I know it isn\'t, and I wish to goodness I could help you out.  By the\r\nway, though," added he, jumping up from his chair, "I\'ve got it."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t," said she; "you\'ll only start the cough.  What have you got?  An\r\nidea?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  Rosalind, do you know I\'m going to get some painting-lessons?"\r\n\r\n"Where?  Oh, I wish I could afford some too.  Is there any one near here\r\nwho teaches?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  Some one who\'s just starting.  A rather jolly girl, only she has\r\nan awful temper; and I\'m afraid, when she sees what a poor hand I make,\r\nshe\'ll have no patience with me."\r\n\r\nRosalind looked at him steadily, and then smiled.\r\n\r\n"How nice of you!  May I really try?  I\'ll teach you all I know."\r\n\r\n"Will you promise to be nice, and never to fly out at me?"\r\n\r\n"No, I\'ll promise nothing of the sort.  But if you learn well, I\'ll be\r\nvery proud."\r\n\r\n"And your terms?"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him again.\r\n\r\n"Would a shilling an hour be an awful lot?"\r\n\r\n"No.  It\'s very moderate.  I accept the terms.  I\'ll begin to-day."\r\n\r\nThis satisfactory bargain being concluded.  Miss Rosalind inquired how\r\nher new pupil\'s cold was.\r\n\r\n"Nearly all right.  I\'m glad to have got rid of it before Armstrong\r\ncomes back."\r\n\r\n"When will that be?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know.  He hasn\'t written a line.  I hope he\'ll come soon."\r\n\r\n"Are you awfully fond of him!" asked Rosalind.\r\n\r\n"Rather," replied the boy.\r\n\r\n"That\'s exactly what he said when I asked him if he was fond of you."\r\n\r\n"Odd," said Roger with a laugh.  "But, I say, what do you think of my\r\nden?  Isn\'t it rather snug?"\r\n\r\n"I like one of the pictures," said Rosalind, pointing to a certain\r\nportrait on the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n"I\'m awfully glad," said Roger.  "Do you know who it is?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"A brother of mine who died long before I was born."\r\n\r\nRosalind took the picture in her hands and carried it to the window.\r\nThe scrutiny lasted some minutes.  Then she replaced it on the chimney-\r\npiece.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Roger, "do you like him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do."\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you a little afraid of him, too?"\r\n\r\n"Not a bit.  He looks like a hero."\r\n\r\nRoger sighed.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad there\'s one in the family," said he.\r\n\r\n"Why not two?  I say, will your tutor mind your having painting-lessons\r\nof me?"\r\n\r\n"Mind?  Not he.  I shouldn\'t be surprised if he wants to have some too."\r\n\r\nRosalind laughed.\r\n\r\n"That would be too terrible," said she.  "But I must go now.  Will you\r\nlend me this picture for a little?  I\'d like to look at it again."\r\n\r\nRoger laughed.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, if you\'ll promise not to fall in love with him for good."\r\n\r\nWhen Roger presented himself at the appointed hour in his cousin\'s\r\nstudio, he found that young lady very much in earnest and not at all\r\ndisposed to regard her new functions as a jest.  Roger, who had come\r\nexpecting to be amused, found himself ignominiously set down at a table\r\nbeside the amenable Tom (who had been coerced into joining the class)\r\nand directed to copy a very elementary representation of a gable of a\r\ncottage which the instructress had set up on the easel.  Six times was\r\nhe compelled to tackle this simple object before his copy was pronounced\r\npassable; and until that Rosalind sternly discouraged all conversation\r\nor inattention.\r\n\r\n"Really, Roger," said she, when at last he meekly submitted his final\r\ncopy, "for a boy of your age you are an uncommonly rough hand.  Tom is a\r\nmuch more promising pupil than you."\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t promised you a bob an hour, though," rejoined that not-to-be-\r\nflattered genius, beginning to whistle.\r\n\r\n"Silence, sir!" said Miss Rosalind, stamping her little foot with\r\nsomething like temper; "as long as you are in my class you must do as I\r\ntell you."\r\n\r\nHere Roger protested.\r\n\r\n"You\'re rather strict," said he.  "I don\'t mind working hard and\r\nattending to all you say, but I vote we enjoy ourselves too--all three\r\nof us."\r\n\r\n"You mean," said Rosalind petulantly, "that you come here to play, while\r\nI try to work."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t.  I come to do both, and I want you to, as well."\r\n\r\n"Very well then, I withdraw from my engagement," said the young lady,\r\nwith an ominous flush; "we don\'t agree about art.  Unless you can give\r\nyourself up to it while you are about it, it\'s not meant for you--and--\r\nand I\'m very sorry indeed I made such a stupid mistake as to think you\r\nmeant what you said when you told me you wanted to learn."\r\n\r\nAnd she took the copy down from the easel.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Rosalind," said Roger, in unusual perturbation, "I\'m so\r\nsorry.  You\'re quite right.  Of course one can\'t do two things at once.\r\nI\'ll--"\r\n\r\n"You\'re a dear boy, as I\'ve said before," said Miss Oliphant,\r\nbrightening up suddenly and accepting her victory serenely.  "Now please\r\nboth of you draw the picture again from memory as exactly as you can."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the long and short of it all?" presently whispered Tom, who had\r\nbeen supremely indifferent to the argument.  "Is it larks or no larks?"\r\n\r\n"Shut up!--that\'s what it is," said Roger.\r\n\r\n"All right; thanks," said Tom contentedly.\r\n\r\nAnd for a quarter of an hour more the two worked steadily and silently,\r\nthe only sound in the room being the scratching of their pencils and\r\nRosalind\'s occasional terse criticisms over their shoulders.\r\n\r\nThis little incident opened Roger\'s eyes considerably.  He was\r\nastonished at himself afterwards for taking his rebuff so meekly, and\r\nsubmitting to what, after all, was rather a preposterous regulation.  He\r\nwas aware that he would not have submitted to any one but Rosalind, or\r\npossibly Armstrong.  Why he should do so to her he did not particularly\r\nknow; unless it was because he felt it would be pleasanter on the whole\r\nto have her as a friend than as a foe.\r\n\r\nWhen, three days later, Mr Armstrong neither appeared nor communicated\r\nwith any member of the household, the uneasiness which his prolonged\r\nabsence caused found expression in several different ways.  Miss Jill\r\ncried in a corner; Miss Rosalind tossed her head and painted fiercely;\r\nRoger, already pulled down with a return of his cough, moped in his own\r\nroom; while his mother, impressed by the growing indignation of her\r\ncousin, began to work herself into a mild state of wrath.  Tom alone was\r\nserene.\r\n\r\n"I expect he\'s having a jolly time with that French chap," he\r\nvolunteered at the family dinner.\r\n\r\n"With whom?" inquired his father pricking his ears.\r\n\r\n"Oh, a chum of his; not half a bad sort of cove, only he dropped all his\r\n`h\'s.\'  He turned up at Christy\'s, you know, but missed the best break-\r\ndown, while he and Mr Armstrong were hob-nobbing outside.  I saw it,\r\nthough.  It was prime."\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you tell me this before?" demanded Captain Oliphant.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know you\'d care about it," said his son in mild surprise.\r\n"You see, it was this way.  The fellow had wooden shoes on, and when the\r\nmusic began slow he began a shuffle, and gradually put on the pace till\r\nyou couldn\'t tell one foot from the other."\r\n\r\nHere Miss Rosalind broke into a derisive laugh.\r\n\r\n"Really, Tom," said she, "you are too clever.  However did you guess\r\nthat we were all dying to hear how a break-down is danced?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t till father said so."\r\n\r\nHere Roger and the two young ladies laughed again; whereat Tom,\r\nconcluding he had said something good unawares, laughed too, and thought\r\nto himself how jolly it is to be clever and keep the table at a roar.\r\n\r\nIn private Captain Oliphant pursued the subject of Gustav and his\r\nrelations (apart from their mutual connexion with the break-down) with\r\nthe Maxfield tutor.\r\n\r\nHe received very little satisfaction from his inquiry.  Tom was so full\r\nof his main topic that the other events of that memorable evening in\r\ntown occupied but a secondary place in his memory.\r\n\r\nHe recollected Gustav as a good-natured foreigner whom Armstrong called\r\nby his Christian name, and who talked French in return.  He could not\r\nremember where he lived, except that it was ten minutes\' walk from\r\nChristy\'s Minstrels; nor had he the slightest idea what the two men\r\ntalked about, except that Armstrong had promised to hold somebody\'s\r\nhand, and that Gustav had tried to kiss him by way of recompense.\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant chose to take a very serious view of this disclosure.\r\nIt fitted in exactly with his theory that the tutor was an adventurer of\r\n"shady antecedents," and, as such, an undesirable companion for the late\r\n"dear one\'s" orphan-boy.\r\n\r\n"I should not feel I was doing my duty," said he to Mr Pottinger that\r\nafternoon, "if I were not to follow this up.  We don\'t know whom we have\r\nto deal with; and the fact of Mr Ingleton having confided in him\r\nreally, you know, weighs very little with me; old men of enfeebled\r\nintellect, my dear Pottinger, are so easily hoodwinked."\r\n\r\n"Quite so.  Does it not occur to you, Captain, that a simple solution of\r\nthe difficulty would be for Mrs Ingleton to send her boy to college?"\r\n\r\n"Mrs Ingleton," said the Captain, "is unfortunately incapable of\r\nregarding this subject in any light but that of her son\'s likings.  And\r\nRoger Ingleton, minor, is infatuated."\r\n\r\n"Humph!" said the lawyer, "I thought so.  Then I agree with you, it will\r\nbe useful to institute a few inquiries."\r\n\r\n"Leave that to me," said the captain.  "By the way, what about that\r\npiece of land you were speaking of?"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said the lawyer, making as near an approach to a blush as he could\r\nmuster, "the fact is, Hodder\'s lease falls in next week.  He has had it\r\nat a ridiculously low figure, and is not a profitable tenant."\r\n\r\n"That is the old dotard who is always croaking about Maxfield in the\r\ndays before the Flood?"\r\n\r\n"Well, almost as remote a period.  He was here in the time of the late\r\nsquire\'s father.  At any rate his lease falls in; and I happen to know a\r\nperson who is willing to give twenty per cent more for the land than he\r\npays.  I can\'t tell you his name," said the lawyer, looking sufficiently\r\nconscious, "but I happen to know he would be a better tenant to Maxfield\r\nthan the old man."\r\n\r\nMr Pottinger amused himself with making a little mystery about a matter\r\nthat was no secret to Captain Oliphant.  That gallant gentleman knew as\r\nwell as the lawyer did that Mr Pottinger himself, whose land adjoined\r\nHodder\'s, was the eligible tenant in question.\r\n\r\n"There will be no difficulty about that, Pottinger.  Of course, you must\r\ngive Hodder the option of offering your friend\'s price.  If he does not,\r\nit is clearly the duty of the executors to take the better tenant."\r\n\r\nHe took up his hat and turned to go.\r\n\r\n"By the way," said he at the door, "it will hardly be necessary, I take\r\nit, to go through the farce of bringing a trifling matter of this kind\r\nbefore the other executors; Mrs Ingleton should really be spared all\r\nworry of this sort; and as for the other one--well, he chooses to be\r\nsomewhere else."\r\n\r\n"Quite so, quite so.  If you and Mrs Ingleton sign the lease it will be\r\nsufficient," said Mr Pottinger.\r\n\r\nUnluckily for the pleasantly arranged plan of these two good gentlemen,\r\nMiss Rosalind Oliphant took it into her pretty head a day or so\r\nafterwards to call at old Hodder\'s cottage in passing, to ask for a\r\nglass of milk.  The young lady was in a very discontented frame of mind.\r\nShe was angry with Mr Armstrong for staying away so long.  Not that\r\nshe cared what he did, but till he came back she felt she did not know\r\nthe full extent of the forces arrayed against her at Maxfield; and she\r\nwanted to know the worst.  Besides, although Roger was diligently\r\nprosecuting his art studies and displaying the most docile obedience to\r\nher discipline, she could not help thinking he would not have taken to\r\nart except to please her; and that displeased her mightily.  Besides,\r\nTom, her brother, was too silly for anything; he insisted on enjoying\r\nhimself, whoever else was miserable; and Jill was very little better.\r\nAltogether, Miss Oliphant was out of humour, and felt this walk would do\r\nher good.\r\n\r\nShe found the Hodder family in mighty tribulation.  The old man sat in\r\nhis corner with his hat on the floor beside him, crying and boohing like\r\na child.  And his two little granddaughters looked on at his grief, pale\r\nand half-frightened, knowing something bad had happened, but unable to\r\nguess what.\r\n\r\n"Why, Hodder," said Miss Rosalind, "whatever\'s the matter?  What a noise\r\nyou\'re making!  What has happened?"\r\n\r\n"Happened!" cried the old man with a voice quavering into a shrill\r\ntreble.  "How would he like it himself?  Seventy years, boy and man,\r\nhave I sat here, like my father before me.  I\'ve seen yon elm grow from\r\na stick to what she is now.  I\'ve buried all my kith and kin bar them\r\ntwo lassies."\r\n\r\n"Of course, I know you\'re very old.  But why are you crying?" demanded\r\nRosalind.\r\n\r\n"Crying!  Wouldn\'t you cry, Missy, if you was to be turned neck and crop\r\ninto the road at threescore years and ten?"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense.  What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Come Tuesday," sobbed the old man, "me and the lassies will be\r\ntrespassers in this here very place."\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed Miss Rosalind, "do you mean you\'re to be turned out?\r\nWho dares to do such a thing?"\r\n\r\n"You go and ask Mr Pottinger, if you doubt it," blubbered the old man.\r\n"He ought to know."\r\n\r\nWithout another word, Miss Rosalind flung herself from the cottage and\r\nmarched straight for the lawyer\'s, pale, with bosom heaving and a light\r\nin her eyes, that Armstrong, had he been there to see it, would have\r\nshivered at.\r\n\r\n"Mr Pottinger," said she, breaking unceremoniously into the lawyer\'s\r\nprivate room, "what is this I hear!  How dare you frighten old Hodder by\r\ntalking about his leaving his farm?"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer stared at this beautiful apparition, not knowing whether to\r\nbe amused or angry.  It was the first time any one in Maxfield had\r\naddressed him in this strain, and the sensation was so novel that he\r\nfelt fairly taken aback.\r\n\r\n"Really, dear young lady, I am delighted with any excuse that gives me\r\nthe pleasure of a visit from--"\r\n\r\n"Mr Pottinger," said the young lady in a tone which made him open his\r\neyes still wider, "will you tell me, yes or no, if what Hodder tells me\r\nis true?"\r\n\r\n"That depends on what Hodder says," replied the lawyer, trying to look\r\ncheerful.\r\n\r\n"He says he has had notice to leave his farm next week.  Is that true?"\r\n\r\n"That entirely depends on himself, if I _must_ suffer cross-examination\r\nfrom so charming a counsel."\r\n\r\n"You mean--"\r\n\r\n"I mean, my pretty young lady, that if he chooses to pay the new rent he\r\nis entitled to stay."\r\n\r\n"You have raised his rent?--a poor old man of seventy-five?"\r\n\r\n"I have no power to do that.  But I understand he has had the land for\r\nnext to nothing.  It is worth more now."\r\n\r\n"Mr Pottinger," said Miss Rosalind, "let me tell you that if you have\r\nany hand in this wicked business you are a bad man, whatever you profess\r\nto be.  I shouldn\'t sleep to-night if I failed to tell you that.  So is\r\neverybody who dares treat an old man thus."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, Miss Oliphant, that is not quite respectful to your own\r\nfather."\r\n\r\nShe rounded on him with trembling lips.\r\n\r\n"My father," she began and faltered--"my father is not the sort of man\r\nto do a thing of this kind unless he were cajoled into it by some--\r\nsome--some one like you, Mr Pottinger--"\r\n\r\nWith which she left the room, much to the lawyer\'s relief, who tried to\r\nlaugh to himself at the pretty vixen, but couldn\'t be as merry as he\r\nwould have wished.\r\n\r\nRosalind, on her return to Maxfield, went straight with flashing eyes to\r\nRoger\'s room, and told him the story.\r\n\r\n"Roger," she said, "if you are half a man you will stop it.  You are\r\nmaster here, or will be.  Are you going to let this poor old man be\r\nturned out of his home?  You are not the dear boy I take you for, if you\r\nare."\r\n\r\n"Of course it must be stopped," said Roger, amazed at her vehemence;\r\n"and it shall be.  I always thought Pottinger a sneak.  I assure you,\r\nRosalind, I shall make poor old Hodder happy before we are a day older.\r\nSo good-bye; I\'ll go at once."\r\n\r\nBut he was no match for the lawyer, who politely recounted the\r\ncircumstances and referred him to his guardians, who, however, as he\r\npointed out, had no choice but to accept the best-paying tenant.\r\n\r\n"It is done in your interest, my dear boy," said Mr Pottinger.  "We are\r\nbound to consider your interests, whether you like it or not."\r\n\r\nMortified beyond measure, both on his own account and at the prospect of\r\nfacing Rosalind, Roger returned slowly to Maxfield.  As he entered, a\r\nhand was laid on his shoulder; Mr Armstrong had come back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nMR. ARMSTRONG PUTS DOWN HIS FOOT.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong, as unconcerned as if he had just returned from a half-\r\nhour\'s stroll, had little idea of the flutter which his return caused to\r\nthe Maxfield family.  He could hardly know that Raffles was parading the\r\nlower regions rubbing his hands, and informing his acquaintance down\r\nthere that the season for "larks" was coming on; nor, as he was out of\r\nearshot, could he be supposed to know the particularly forcible\r\nexpressions which Captain Oliphant rehearsed to himself in celebration\r\nof the occasion.  As for the young people, it did afford him a passing\r\ngratification to feel his pupil\'s arm linked once more in his own, and\r\nto encounter the expected boisterous welcome from Tom and Jill.  Miss\r\nRosalind was busy, forsooth! and if Mr Armstrong flattered himself she\r\ntook the slightest interest in his return, he might find out his\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll join you in a minute, Roger," said he to his ward, "but I must go\r\nand pay my respects to your mother."\r\n\r\n"Oh, she\'ll keep," said Roger; "I want to hear what you\'ve been up to."\r\n\r\n"In five minutes," said the tutor, going to the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nMrs Ingleton was there, looking pale and fragile, pouring out afternoon\r\ntea for Captain Oliphant.\r\n\r\n"Why, Mr Armstrong," said she, "we had given you up for lost; Roger was\r\ngetting quite melancholy without you."\r\n\r\n"I understood," began the captain, "when you asked leave--"\r\n\r\n"Mrs Ingleton, I must ask you to excuse my long absence.  I went to see\r\na dying friend, and was unable to return earlier."\r\n\r\n"You might have written," said the captain, returning to the charge.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong screwed his eye-glass round and stared at the speaker.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon," said he.\r\n\r\n"I say, sir, you might have written.  Let me tell you, Mr Armstrong,\r\nthat, as my dear relative\'s co-trustee and guardian--"\r\n\r\n"I am sorry," observed the tutor, addressing Mrs Ingleton, "that\r\nRoger\'s cough is still troubling him.  He is waiting for me upstairs, by\r\nthe bye, but I was anxious to offer you my apologies without delay for\r\nmy long absence."\r\n\r\n"Mr Armstrong," said the captain, stepping between the tutor and the\r\ndoor, "this will not do, sir.  When I speak to you, I expect you to\r\nlisten."\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong bowed politely.\r\n\r\n"I repeat, sir, your conduct satisfies neither me nor your mistress.\r\nYou forget, sir, that you are here on sufferance, and I desire to\r\ncaution you that it may become necessary to dispense with your services,\r\nunless-- I am speaking to you, Mr Armstrong."\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong was examining with some curiosity a china group on the\r\nmantelpiece.  He turned round gravely.\r\n\r\n"You were saying--?" said he.\r\n\r\nThe captain gave it up.\r\n\r\n"We shall discuss this matter some other time," said he.\r\n\r\n"Pray, pray," said Mrs Ingleton with tears in her eyes, "let us not\r\nforget that my boy\'s happiness depends on our harmony.  I am sure Mr\r\nArmstrong recognises that I depend on you both."\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong bowed again; and finding that the captain had returned to\r\nhis chair, he quietly left the room.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered Roger\'s room, humming a tune to himself, he neither\r\nlooked like a man who had returned from a funeral or from an altercation\r\nin the drawing-room.  In five minutes he was in possession of most of\r\nwhat had taken place during his absence--of Roger\'s cold, of the\r\npainting-lessons, of Tom\'s reminiscences of Christy\'s Minstrels, and\r\nmost of all of Hodder\'s tribulation.\r\n\r\n"And what sort of an artist are you turning out?" inquired he.\r\n\r\n"Oh, all right.  But I say, Armstrong, I want you to make it right about\r\nHodder before anything.  Will you come and see him?"\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, Hodder is as safe in his cottage as you are here.\r\nLeave that to your responsible guardian.  My present intention is to\r\nwork on the tender mercies of Raffles for some dinner.  I have travelled\r\nright through from Paris since this morning."\r\n\r\n"Your friend died?" inquired Roger.\r\n\r\n"Yes.  I was in time to be of some little help, I think, but he was past\r\nrecovery.  How is Miss Oliphant?"\r\n\r\n"All right; but in an awful state about old Hodder.  I\'m afraid to meet\r\nher myself.  She will be relieved to have you back."\r\n\r\n"Will she really?" said the tutor, laughing.  "I hardly flatter myself\r\nher comfort depends on which particular hemisphere I happen to be in."\r\n\r\nMiss Oliphant, as it happened, had taken to a spell of hard work in her\r\nstudio, and was not visible all the evening.  She was, in fact, making a\r\ncopy of the portrait Roger had lent her, and the work interested her\r\ngreatly.\r\n\r\nThis bold, fearless, almost insolent, boy\'s face fascinated her.  She\r\nseemed to be able to interpret the defiance that flashed in his eye, and\r\nto solve the problem which gathered on his half-mocking lips.  She was\r\nhalf afraid, half enamoured of this old piece of canvas.\r\n\r\n"Why are not you here now?" she muttered as she gazed at it.  "You don\'t\r\nlook like the sort of boy to die.  Should we be friends or enemies?\r\nHeigho!  I shouldn\'t care much which, if only you were here.  Roger\r\nminor is a dear boy; but--you are--"\r\n\r\nShe didn\'t say what he was, but worked late into the night with her\r\ncopy.\r\n\r\nAt bedtime Jill came in radiant.\r\n\r\n"He\'s come back, Rosalind.  Dear Mr Armstrong\'s come back."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Rosalind shortly.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you glad?  Oh, I am!"\r\n\r\n"Why should I be glad?  I don\'t care two straws for all the Mr\r\nArmstrongs in the world.  Go to bed, Jill, and don\'t be a goose."\r\n\r\nJill obeyed, a little discomfited, and was sound asleep long before the\r\nartist joined her.  And long before she woke from her dreams next\r\nmorning Rosalind was astir and abroad.  She had resolved to pay an early\r\ncall on old Hodder, if not to relieve his mind about the eviction, at\r\nleast to take him some comfort in the shape of a little tea and sugar.\r\n\r\nThe old man was sitting outside the cottage, smoking and moaning to\r\nhimself.  He cheered up a bit at the sight of his visitor, still more at\r\nthe sight of the tea.  But it was a short-lived gleam of comfort, and he\r\nrelapsed at the earliest opportunity into the doleful.\r\n\r\n"Little good it\'ll do me," said he, "as have known this place, man and\r\nboy, seventy-five years, Missy.  Never a word did they say to me till\r\nnow.  The old squire had allers his nod for Hodder, and when times was\r\nbad he let the rent stand.  And young Master Roger was of the same\r\nsort."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Roger is your friend still," said Rosalind; "he\'s doing everything\r\nto help you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean _him_.  He\'s good enough; but he\'s a boy.  But young\r\nMaster Roger as was, he had a will of his own, Missy.  Not one of \'em\r\ndurst stand up to him."\r\n\r\nRosalind became interested.  "Do you mean the one who died?" said she.\r\n\r\n"Ay, they say he died.  They said as much and wrote it on the\r\ntombstone."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that there was ever a doubt about it?" said the young lady\r\nuncomfortably.\r\n\r\n"They said he died, so he must have died," said old Hodder, sipping his\r\ntea.  "It was all talk to the likes of me.  Young Master Roger wasn\'t of\r\nthe dying sort."\r\n\r\n"He went abroad, I hear?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"So they say.  It\'s a score of years or more since.  I tell \'ee, Missy,\r\nyoung Master Roger wouldn\'t have stood by to see me turned out like\r\nthis; he\'d have--"\r\n\r\nHere there was a click at the gate and a long shadow fell on the\r\nfootpath.  It was Mr Armstrong in his flannels.  He looked somewhat\r\nalarmed to find Miss Rosalind in possession.  Still more to perceive\r\nthat she proposed to remain where she was.  His impulse was to make a\r\nfeeble excuse and say he would call again.  But his courage revived on\r\nsecond thoughts.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Hodder," said he, after saluting the young lady, "what\'s all this\r\nabout turning you out of your cottage!  What a notion to get into your\r\nhead!"\r\n\r\n"You may call it a notion, Mr Armstrong," said the old man, "but what\r\nabout this here piece of paper?"  And he produced a blue legal document.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong put up his eye-glass and read it, with a face which, as\r\nRosalind furtively glanced upwards, seemed inscrutable.  When he had\r\nfinished he coolly put it in his pocket.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll see to this," said he.  "You choose the best time of day for a\r\nwalk, Miss Oliphant."\r\n\r\n"Shall you really be able to settle this for Hodder?" replied she.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve very little doubt about it."\r\n\r\nThe old man chuckled ungallantly.  "He, he," said he, "Missy, you ladies\r\nare good enough for tea and sugar, but it takes a man to put the likes\r\nof me right with my masters."\r\n\r\nArmstrong flushed angrily at this speech and was about to relieve his\r\nmind when Rosalind laughingly interposed--\r\n\r\n"Poor old Hodder!  You\'re quite right; I should never have been clever\r\nenough to help you.  Good-bye.  I\'m so glad."\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, Miss Oliphant was a good deal more engrossed with\r\nwhat the old man had let drop concerning the lost Roger than with the\r\ntutor and his knowledge of the law of landlord and tenant.\r\n\r\n"Suppose he did not die!" she said, half scared at the boldness of the\r\nsuggestion.  "If he were to come back!"  And she went back and looked\r\nlong once more at the picture.  Then with less satisfaction she\r\ncontemplated her own copy.  Thus employed Roger found her when he passed\r\nher door an hour later.\r\n\r\n"Still harping on my brother," said he.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve done with him, thank you," said Rosalind, handing him back the\r\npicture.  "See, I have one of my own now."\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s better than the original.  I like it better."\r\n\r\n"That shows how little you know about painting."\r\n\r\n"It shows how much you know about my brother," said he.  "But if you\r\nlike to keep the original and let me have the copy, I should consider I\r\nhad the best of the bargain."\r\n\r\nRosalind tossed her head and locked her own copy up in her desk.\r\n\r\n"Roger," she said when that was done, "where did he die?"\r\n\r\n"The date is on the picture, if one could only make it out.  He was\r\nabroad at the time, I believe."\r\n\r\n"Where?"\r\n\r\n"I never heard."\r\n\r\n"Have you never tried to find out?"\r\n\r\nRoger looked at her, startled.\r\n\r\n"It was before I was born," said he.  "Father never spoke of him.  But\r\nwhy do you ask?"\r\n\r\n"Only a girl\'s curiosity.  I thought, if any one knew, you would.  But\r\nthere is the bell for lunch."\r\n\r\nArmstrong meanwhile had been having an interview of a different kind.\r\nHe strolled into Mr Pottinger\'s office almost at the same time as that\r\nworthy lawyer himself.\r\n\r\n"So you are back?" asked the latter.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and quite at your service," said the tutor.  "I am afraid my\r\nabsence has been inconvenient.  But I am ready for business now.  By the\r\nway, I have brought you back a document which must have been left on old\r\nHodder by mistake.  I certainly did not sanction it."\r\n\r\nThe lawyer sat back in his chair and gazed at the tutor through his\r\nspectacles.  Mr Armstrong, leaning against the chimney-piece, put up\r\nhis glass and gazed leisurely back.  The two men understood one another\r\npretty well already.\r\n\r\n"The notice is quite in order.  I have Captain Oliphant\'s instructions."\r\n\r\n"And mine?"\r\n\r\n"You were not here."\r\n\r\n"I am here now, and I object to Hodder\'s being disturbed.  Do I make\r\nmyself clear?"\r\n\r\n"But--"\r\n\r\n"You must excuse me, Mr Pottinger.  I shall be glad to discuss the\r\nmatter with you in the presence of my co-trustees.  Meanwhile, good-\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\nThe lawyer jumped out of his chair like a man shot.\r\n\r\n"What, sir--you, an interloper, an adventurer, a nobody, a parasite--do\r\nyou suppose I am going to be talked to by you as if I didn\'t know my own\r\nduty.  Do you know, Master Usher, that you can any day receive a week\'s\r\nnotice of dismissal--"\r\n\r\n"A month\'s, I think," observed the tutor, taking up his hat.  "In that\r\nrespect, perhaps, I have the advantage of the solicitor to the trust.\r\nHowever, we won\'t talk of that just now.  Good-morning again."\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong looked in on his friend the doctor, whom he found in an\r\nopportune moment at breakfast.  The two men had a long chat over their\r\ncoffee, and finally adjourned for a walk along the shore, ending up with\r\na cool spring dip in Sheephaven Cove.  After which, much refreshed, and\r\nglad to be once more in his familiar haunts, the tutor strolled\r\ncheerfully back to Maxfield for lunch.  He was quite aware things had\r\nundergone a change.  He had two new enemies, but he was not afraid of\r\nthem.  He had a new pupil, but he liked him.  He had a devoted new\r\nchampion, in the shape of a little girl, but that was no hardship,\r\nRoger, too, despite his new friends, was still loyal to his tutor; and\r\nMrs Ingleton, by all appearances, still regarded him as a useful\r\nfriend.  What then was the difference!  It could hardly have anything to\r\ndo with a certain young person half his own age, with whom the tutor had\r\nnot had two hours\' continuous conversation in his life, and of whose\r\nbehaviour generally he did not at all know whether he approved or not.\r\n\r\n"Ridiculous!" said Mr Armstrong to himself with a smile, as he strolled\r\nup the carriage drive.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the distant hall-door opened, and a light figure stepped\r\nout for a moment on to the door-step to pat the great mastiff that lay\r\nsleeping on the mat.  The apparition, the caress, and the vanishing\r\noccupied scarcely half a minute, and when it was past Mr Armstrong was\r\nonly ten paces nearer the house than he had been when it appeared.\r\n\r\nBut, somehow, in those few seconds the amused smile on his lips faded\r\naway, and the eye-glass dropped somewhat limply from his eye, as he\r\nrepeated to himself more emphatically than before--\r\n\r\n"Ridiculous!"\r\n\r\nAt lunch, Roger innocently broached the question of Hodder\'s eviction.\r\n\r\n"Mother," said he, "what do you think that idiot Pottinger has been up\r\nto?  He\'s taken it into his wise head to threaten to turn old Hodder out\r\nof his cottage unless he pays a higher rent in future.  I went to row\r\nhim about it, but he\'s far too dense to see what a scoundrelly thing it\r\nis."\r\n\r\n"How shocking!" said Mrs Ingleton.  "Poor old Hodder has been in that\r\nplace all his life.  Your father was always fond of him, Roger.  I\r\nwouldn\'t have him disturbed for the world."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to tell Pottinger so yourself," said Roger.  "He says he\'s\r\nbound to screw all he can out of the old chap in my interests, if you\r\nplease."\r\n\r\nThe captain had listened to this parley with anything but comfort, and\r\nwas about at this point to explain, when Mr Armstrong seeing his chance\r\nadroitly stepped in.\r\n\r\n"You may make yourself easy about the matter, Roger.  Evidently Mr\r\nPottinger has acted most unwarrantably on his own responsibility.  I\r\nhave been to see him this morning, and told him in future he is not to\r\ntake upon himself to do anything about the estate without consulting\r\nMrs Ingleton, and Captain Oliphant, and myself--"\r\n\r\n"Then Hodder is not to be disturbed?" inquired Rosalind.\r\n\r\n"I have seen that the notice is withdrawn.  I, for one, should certainly\r\nnever sanction it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, how delightful you are," said the young lady.  "How happy you will\r\nhave made the poor old man.  Father, do get that horrid Pottinger sent\r\naway.  He\'s a monster.  I told him so yesterday, but he wouldn\'t believe\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Rosalind," said her father, whose lunch was not agreeing with him at\r\nall, "it vexes me to see you interfere in matters in which you have no\r\nconcern.  It seems to me, my dear Eva," he added, addressing Mrs\r\nIngleton, whom he had already taken to calling by her Christian name,\r\n"that these business questions had much better be left for discussion\r\namong ourselves, and not at the family meal."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps so," said Mrs Ingleton; "only we are all so interested in poor\r\nold Hodder, we hardly regard this as a business question.  However, I am\r\ndelighted to hear it is all right now.  I only wish Mr Pottinger had\r\nconsulted you, Edward, before he took such a step."\r\n\r\n"Oh, he did," blurted out Rosalind.  "But, as I told him, of course papa\r\nnot knowing what a villain he was, would believe all he said.  It was\r\nall the more shame of him to go and impose on papa, who hasn\'t had time\r\nto get to know all the people about the place, instead of going to\r\nAuntie or Mr Armstrong, who know all of them.  I don\'t think he\'ll do\r\nit again," said the young lady, firing up like a charming Amazon, at the\r\nremembrance of her interview.\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant pushed his chair brusquely back from the table and got\r\nup, looking, so Armstrong thought, not as proud of his loyal daughter as\r\nhe should have been.\r\n\r\n"Eva," said he drily, "I shall be in the library if you want me.  Will\r\nyou tell Raffles to bring me in the _Times_ when it arrives?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid papa will be very angry with me," said Rosalind dolefully,\r\nas she and Roger walked back across the hall.  "But if he won\'t stand up\r\nfor himself some one must.  I\'m quite sure he would give the impression,\r\nto any one who did not know him, that he had purposely been harsh to\r\npoor Hodder."\r\n\r\nAs it happened, Captain Oliphant displayed no anger.  The question of\r\nHodder was allowed to drop, and no further reference was made to his\r\nthreatened eviction.  Mr Pottinger during the week meekly submitted an\r\nagreement to permit him to remain where he was, which the trustees\r\nsanctioned unanimously; and when the old man\'s champions at Maxfield\r\nrejoiced in the discomfiture of the man of the law.\r\n\r\nCaptain Edward Oliphant said nothing in his defence.\r\n\r\nAfter this matters went on quietly, as they will do when one storm has\r\nblown over and the next is yet below the horizon.  Armstrong settled\r\ndown to his duties with his two pupils--or rather his three pupils, for\r\nMiss Jill made a point of receiving lessons too.  Miss Rosalind worked\r\naway at her painting, and succeeded in evoking a glimmering interest in\r\nart in the Philistine breasts of her two students.  The young people\r\ndivided their leisure between riding, cricket, tennis, and yachting.\r\nMrs Ingleton, as the weeks went by, not only grew more pale, but began\r\nto be aware of the attentions of her sympathetic kinsman, and to be\r\nsorely perplexed and disturbed thereat.  And the Captain himself\r\nreceived his Indian letters regularly by each mail, and confessed to\r\nhimself that, but for two considerations--one appertaining to love, the\r\nother to hate--he had better far have remained in Her Majesty\'s service\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nTWO ENDS OF A ROPE.\r\n\r\nThe summer passed, and even Captain Oliphant began to grow reconciled to\r\nhis surroundings.  That is to say, he discovered that at present it was\r\nhis policy to make himself agreeable, even to his co-trustee.\r\nArmstrong, with the position he held at Maxfield as Roger\'s friend and\r\nMrs Ingleton\'s trusted servant, was not to be disposed of quite as\r\neasily as the gallant officer had at first anticipated.  At the same\r\ntime, while he remained where he was, the Captain felt himself decidedly\r\nembarrassed in the working out of sundry little projects which floated\r\nin his ingenious brain.  Besides which, time was getting on.  Roger\r\nwould be twenty in November, and a year later--\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant had reached this pleasant stage in his meditations one\r\nmorning, as he sipped his coffee in his own room, when Raffles entered\r\nwith the letters.\r\n\r\n"Eightpence to pay on this one, please, sir."\r\n\r\nIt was a letter with an Indian post-mark, unstamped.\r\n\r\nThe Captain regarded it with knitted brows; then tossing it on the\r\ntable, said--\r\n\r\n"Give it back.  I won\'t take it in, Raffles."  Raffles, reflecting\r\nwithin himself that the Captain must have a vast amount of\r\ncorrespondence if he could afford to chuck away an interesting document\r\nlike this, took the letter and retired.\r\n\r\n"Wait a minute," called the Captain, as the door was closing.  "Let me\r\nlook at it again."\r\n\r\nRaffles guessed as much, and brought the missive back triumphantly.  The\r\nCaptain again regarded it with expressions of anything but cordiality,\r\nand seemed half inclined to reject it once more.  But he took it up\r\nagain and posed it in his hand.\r\n\r\n"You can leave it, Raffles," said he presently; "give the postman the\r\neightpence."\r\n\r\nIt was some time before Captain Oliphant opened the letter.  He sipped\r\nhis coffee and glared at it viciously, as it lay on the table beside\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"What game is the scoundrel up to now?" muttered he.  "I began to hope I\r\nwas rid of him.  What does he want now?"\r\n\r\nHe opened the letter and read--\r\n\r\n  "Dear Comrade,--You have not answered my last three letters, and I\r\n  feel quite anxious to know of your welfare.  You will be pleased to\r\n  hear that I have arranged to take my leave home during the coming\r\n  autumn--"\r\n\r\nThe Captain put the letter down with an exclamation which startled the\r\nsparrows on the window-ledge, and set the breakfast cup shaking in its\r\nsaucer.\r\n\r\n"Coming home!" he gasped.  Then he read on.\r\n\r\n  "I look forward to inquiring personally after your health and\r\n  prospects, in which, as you know, my dear fellow, I am much\r\n  interested.  It would be very nice of you, as the only friend I have\r\n  in England, to ask your old comrade on a visit to you in your\r\n  comfortable quarters.  A particular advantage in such an arrangement\r\n  would be that it would prevent my coming without being asked.  I am\r\n  due by the `Nile\' about the first week in October.  Come and meet me\r\n  in town.  I have no doubt I shall get a line at Southampton to say at\r\n  which hotel I shall find you.  I fear you will find me financially in\r\n  low water.  But I shall have with me papers relating to the regimental\r\n  accounts previous to your regretted departure from India, which, no\r\n  doubt, some people would regard as valuable, _Au revoir_, my dear\r\n  fellow--\r\n\r\n  "Yours ever,--\r\n\r\n  "R.R.\r\n\r\n  "_P.S_.--Commend me to your charming family, I look forward with\r\n  particular pleasure to make the acquaintance of the young ladies, of\r\n  whom I have heard delightful reports over here."\r\n\r\nRaffles, when he came in to remove the breakfast things, could not help\r\nbeing struck with the narrow escape Captain Oliphant had had of throwing\r\naway, for the sake of a paltry eightpence, a most interesting and\r\nappetising letter.\r\n\r\nThe Captain sat holding it abstractedly in his hand, nor was it till the\r\ndoor opened half an hour later and Rosalind sailed in that he hastily\r\npulled himself together, and crumpled the paper away in his pocket.\r\n\r\n"Why, papa, what is the matter?  Is there any bad news in that letter."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, it announces the arrival from India of a very dear old\r\ncomrade."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Rosalind.  "You will like to hear all about the people over\r\nthere.  Does he belong to our regiment?"\r\n\r\n"No, dear.  But I shall expect you to be very agreeable to him when he\r\ncomes here."\r\n\r\n"But he\'s not coming _here_, is he?" she asked, in amazement.\r\n\r\n"Where else do you suppose he would be likely to come to visit me?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, but, papa, we cannot--we must not ask people here.  As it is, think\r\nof all four of us living here on Roger\'s money.  It isn\'t fair."\r\n\r\n"Rosalind, you use expressions which, to anyone but your father, would\r\nbe positively offensive.  Rest assured that I do not require my own\r\nchild to correct me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course, dear father, I don\'t mean that, but--"\r\n\r\n"But it sounds extremely as if you did mean it."\r\n\r\n"I do hope you won\'t ask any one here," said she doggedly.\r\n\r\n"Rosalind, you offend me.  You are incapable, as I have told you before,\r\nof appreciating your duty either to me or yourself.  Oblige me by\r\ngoing."\r\n\r\n"Papa, dear, I am only anxious--"\r\n\r\n"Go!" said the Captain brusquely.\r\n\r\nShe obeyed.  Mr Armstrong, as he met her in the hall and marked the\r\nbright colour in her cheeks and the light in her eyes, thought to\r\nhimself how uncommonly well she was looking this morning.  He might have\r\nthought otherwise had he seen her in her studio half an hour later, with\r\nthe colour all faded, striving miserably to resume her painting at the\r\npoint where she had left it off.\r\n\r\nHer good father, meanwhile, naturally put out, continued his\r\nmeditations.\r\n\r\n"A most vexing child--no support to me at all.  On the contrary, an\r\nembarrassment.  I might have guessed she would cut up rough.  Yet I do\r\nso long for a little sympathy.  Wonder if I shall get any from my dear\r\ncousin Eva some fine day?  Hum.  I more and more incline to that\r\nventure.  It would suit my book, to say nothing of my being really\r\nalmost in love with the dear creature.  But I\'m so abominably shy.\r\nLet\'s see, Ratman is due first week in October--a month hence.  I shall\r\nhave to keep him quiet some how.  He won\'t be satisfied with things as\r\nthey are, I\'m afraid.  All very well to be heir-presumptive when there\'s\r\nlittle prospect of presuming.  Dear Roger is certainly not robust--not\r\nat all, poor boy.  Still he seems tenacious of what would be very much\r\nmore useful to me than to him.  Yes, it would strengthen my hands vastly\r\nif my dear cousin Eva were to give me the right to regard the lad as a\r\nfather.  There would be something definite in that.  It would solve the\r\nArmstrong question, for one thing, I flatter myself; and as for\r\nRosalind--yes by the way--"\r\n\r\nHe took out the letter again and read the postscript carefully.\r\n\r\n"Yes--tut, tut--how oddly things do work out sometimes.  Evidently it is\r\nmy duty all round, for the sake of everybody, to cast aside my natural\r\nbashfulness and use the opportunities Providence gives me."\r\n\r\nWith which reflection he lit a cigar, and had a pleasant ramble in the\r\npark with little Miss Jill, who had rarely seen her papa more lively or\r\namusing.\r\n\r\nHis spirits were destined to be still further cheered by an occurrence\r\nwhich took place on the following day.\r\n\r\nRoger, despite his delicate health, had managed to get through a\r\ncreditable amount of work during the summer under Mr Armstrong\'s\r\nguidance.  He was shortly to go up for his first B.A. in London, and,\r\nwith that ordeal in view, had been tempted to tax his strength even more\r\nthan was good for him.\r\n\r\nAt last the tutor put down his foot.\r\n\r\n"No, old fellow," said he; "if you work any move you will go backwards\r\ninstead of forward.  You must take this week easy, and go up fresh for\r\nthe exam.  Depend on it, you will do far better than if you tried to\r\nkeep it up till the last moment."\r\n\r\nIn vain Roger pleaded, threatened, mutinied.  The tutor was inexorable,\r\nand, fortified by the joint authority of Mrs Ingleton and Dr Brandram,\r\ncarried the day.  He had also an unexpected ally in Miss Rosalind.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be obstinate, Roger," said she.  "The three Fates are too many\r\nfor you; and don\'t sulk, whatever you do, there\'s a dear boy, but make\r\nyourself nice and propose to take Tom and Jill and me across to Pulpit\r\nIsland to-morrow.  If you are so wedded to lessons, you and Tom shall\r\nhave your art class for once in a way on the Pelican\'s Rock instead of\r\nmy room."\r\n\r\nRoger could hardly hold out after this; and Mr Armstrong, a little\r\nenvious, set the seal of his approval to the programme.\r\n\r\n"I wish you\'d come too," said Tom; "can\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, do," said Jill; "it would be twice as nice."\r\n\r\n"Mr Armstrong has enough of all of us on working-days," said Rosalind\r\nrather cruelly, "to forego a chance of being rid of us on a holiday."\r\n\r\n"Quite so," said the tutor, trying to enjoy the situation; "when the\r\nmice are away the cat will play--on the piano."\r\n\r\nThe next day promised well for the picnic; and Roger had sufficiently\r\nwarmed up to the proposed expedition to be able to enter eagerly into\r\nthe preparations.\r\n\r\nThe Pulpit Island, a desolate cavernous rock three miles from the coast,\r\ndominated by a lighthouse, was a familiar hunting-ground of his in days\r\ngone by, and he decidedly enjoyed the prospect of doing the honours of\r\nthe place to his cousins now--particularly one of them.\r\n\r\nAs not a breath of air was stirring, they decided not to encumber the\r\nsmall boat with mast or sail, but to row leisurely across with just as\r\nmuch energy as suited their holiday humour.  The channel was on the\r\nwhole free from currents, and, as Roger knew the landing-places as well\r\nas the oldest sailor in the place, any precaution in the way of a pilot\r\nwas needless.\r\n\r\nArmstrong, as he watched the little craft slowly glide over the glassy\r\nwater, dwindling smaller and smaller, but sending back the sound of\r\nvoices and laughter long after it itself had become an indistinguishable\r\nspeck in the gleaming water, wished himself one of the crew.  But as\r\nfate had ordained otherwise he retreated to his piano, and succeeded in\r\nirritating Captain Oliphant considerably by his brilliant execution,\r\nvocal and instrumental, of some of his favourite pieces.\r\n\r\nThe day, however, was too hot even for music, and after an hour\'s\r\npractice Mr Armstrong gave it up and took a book.\r\n\r\nBut that was dull, and he tried to write some letters.  Worse and worse.\r\nThe place was stifling, and the pen almost melted in his hand.\r\n\r\nWhat was the matter with him?  Why did he feel so down, so lonely.\r\nSurely he could exist a day without his pupil, whatever the temperature.\r\nPerhaps he had his doubts about the boy\'s success in the coming\r\nexamination.  No; he fancied that would be all right.  He would try a\r\nstroll in the park.  It could not at least be hotter under the trees\r\nthan in the house.\r\n\r\nAcross the passage a door stood wide open--a familiar door, through\r\nwhich he caught sight of a familiar easel on the floor, and over the\r\nfireplace one or two familiar Indian knick-knacks.  He couldn\'t help\r\nstopping a moment to peep in.  It seemed cooler in there.  What was the\r\npicture on the easel?  Might he not just look?  A view of the park, with\r\nthe sea beyond-pretty, but--no, not as good as it might be.  Landscape\r\nwas not this artist\'s strong point.  Ah, there was a portrait on the\r\nmantelpiece.  That promised better.  Why, it was the identical boy\'s\r\nportrait that had once hung in the old squire\'s library.  No--it was a\r\ncopy, but an extraordinary copy, as if the original had suddenly lived\r\nwhile it was being made.  Mr Armstrong had rarely seen a portrait which\r\nlooked so like speaking and breathing.  The original in Roger\'s room was\r\nweak compared with this.  And in front of it stood a glass with a rose,\r\nwhose petals leaned over and just touched the canvas--\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong, feeling very guilty, beat a hasty retreat into the hot\r\npassage and made his way down-stairs.  He was a little jealous of that\r\nportrait, perched there in that cool room, with the sweet rose in front\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n"Going out?" said Captain Oliphant in the hall.  The Captain, by the\r\nway, had taken to being civil to his co-trustee, much to Mr Armstrong\'s\r\nannoyance, "Warm, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said he.\r\n\r\n"Beautiful day for those young people."\r\n\r\n"Beautiful," said the tutor.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he casually tapped the barometer at the hall-door, as was\r\nhis habit.  To his surprise, the dial gave a great leap downward.\r\nSomething was wrong with it evidently, for the sky was as monotonously\r\nblue as it had been all day, and not a leaf stirred in the trees.\r\nHowever, Mr Armstrong took the precaution to return to his own room for\r\na moment to consult the barometer there.  It, too, answered him with a\r\ndownward plunge.\r\n\r\nThe tutor screwed his glass rather excitedly into his eye, and looked at\r\nthe clock.  Half-past three.  He touched the bell.\r\n\r\n"Tell the groom to saddle `Pomona\' for me, Raffles.  I will come to the\r\nstables in a minute or two and mount there."\r\n\r\n"You need a bit of exercise this weather, you do," remarked Raffles to\r\nhimself, as he retired, "to keep warm."\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the tutor was riding smartly to Yeld.  During the\r\nhalf-hour occupied by that journey the signs of the approaching storm\r\nbecame manifest.  The blue of the sky took a leaden hue, and out at sea\r\nan ominous cloud-bank lifted its head on the horizon, while the sultry\r\nair seemed to breathe hot on the rider\'s cheek.\r\n\r\nHe pulled up short at Dr Brandram\'s door.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter now?" asked the doctor.  "I hate to see you on\r\nhorseback.  It always means bad news.  Is Mrs Ingleton poorly?  I am\r\nnot at all comfortable about her."\r\n\r\n"No; nobody\'s ill.  But I want you for all that.  There\'s a storm coming\r\non."\r\n\r\n"So the glass says.  All the more reason for staying indoors."\r\n\r\n"The youngsters from the Hall are out in it."\r\n\r\n"Well, can I lend you an umbrella?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be an ass, Brandram.  They are out in an open boat at sea."\r\n\r\nThe doctor jumped to his feet.\r\n\r\n"By Jove!" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"They went to the island this morning, and will have started back a\r\nquarter of an hour ago."\r\n\r\n"They\'ve caught it already, then," said the doctor.  "Look!"\r\n\r\nThe horizon was lurid with clouds.  Pulpit Island out at sea seemed,\r\ninstead of three miles distant, to have come in to within a mile.  The\r\nchannel between, still gleaming in the sun, was struck by a bar of\r\nshadow which seemed like a scar on the surface.  The two men, as they\r\nstood in the street looking seaward, could hear already the solemn hum\r\nthrough the breathless air, and feel the first cool whiff of the breeze\r\non their faces, while at their feet there fell with a sudden plash a\r\nheavy drop of rain.\r\n\r\n"Had they a sail?" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"It\'s coming south-east.  They will drive in this side of Sheep Head."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I thought.  An awful coast, and not a boat there."\r\n\r\n"Get the horse in the gig," said Dr Brandram, "while I put together\r\nwhat we are likely to want.  Look sharp."\r\n\r\nArmstrong wanted no encouragement to be expeditious, and had the trap at\r\nthe door almost before the doctor had his pile of blankets, wraps, with\r\nbrandy and other restoratives, ready to put in it.  In the village they\r\npaused to buy a rope and to warn one or two stragglers of their errand.\r\nThen in the gathering storm they drove hard towards Sheep Head.\r\n\r\nThere was no mistake about the gale now.  The sky was black with clouds,\r\nand the rain and wind struck them simultaneously as they urged on.  The\r\nwarning hum had already risen to a roar, and the wave, as they raced,\r\ncrest over crest, to the shore, hissed and seethed with a fury which\r\ncould be heard a mile off.\r\n\r\nNeither of the men spoke.  Armstrong, with the reins in his hand, kept\r\nhis eyes stolidly between the horse\'s ears.  The doctor, more agitated,\r\nlooked eagerly out across the sea.\r\n\r\nAt last, near the summit of the tall, angular headland, the gig came\r\nabruptly to a standstill.  The horse was tied up, and the two men,\r\nscarcely able to keep their feet, staggered to the cliff edge.  There\r\nfor half an hour they lay, straining their eyes seaward, with the full\r\nfury of the blast on their faces.  It was hopeless to expect to see\r\nanything, for the rain drove blindingly in their eyes, and, though\r\nscarcely five o\'clock, the afternoon was almost as dark as evening.\r\n\r\n"Could they possibly drive clear of the point?" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Not possibly, I think.  Come down to the shore.  We are no use here."\r\n\r\n"Wait a bit; it seems to be getting lighter."\r\n\r\nIt was; but for a long time the glow served only to make the obscurity\r\nmore visible.  Presently, however, the rain paused for a moment, and\r\nenabled them to dear their eyes and look steadily ahead.  Dr Brandram\r\nfelt his arm suddenly gripped as his companion exclaimed hoarsely--\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"Something red."\r\n\r\nSure enough there was a speck of red tossed about in the waves, now\r\nvisible, now lost, now returning.  It was all that could be seen, but it\r\nwas enough for Mr Armstrong.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the boat.  She wore a red cloak.  Come down, come down."\r\n\r\n"No; stop till we see how they are driving.  There\'s time enough."\r\n\r\nAs far as they could calculate, the boat (if boat it was) was being\r\ndriven straight for Sheephaven Cove, under the cliff on which they\r\nstood--a furious, rugged shore--unless, indeed, a miracle should chance\r\nto pitch them into the deep, natural harbour that lay in between the low\r\nrocks and the headland.\r\n\r\n"Come down," said Armstrong again.\r\n\r\nFrom the sea-level nothing, not even the red speck, was discernible; and\r\nfor a terrible five minutes they wondered, as they scrambled out on\r\nhands and knees to the outmost limit of the jutting rocks, whether,\r\namong the wild breakers, the little boat and its precious crew had not\r\nvanished for ever.\r\n\r\nIt was all they could do to struggle to their feet, and, clinging to the\r\nrocks, turn their faces seaward.  A new paroxysm of the gale well-nigh\r\ndashed them backwards, and for a time prevented their seeing anything.\r\nBut in a minute or two it eased off enough to allow them to open their\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"See--there--look out, look out," cried the doctor, pointing.\r\n\r\nHe was right.  About a quarter of a mile away, buffeted like a cork on\r\nthe water, was a boat, and in it something red.\r\n\r\n"Stand up and wave; it\'s no use shouting," said Armstrong.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of a temporary lull, they stood and waved their coats\r\nabove their heads.  Whether they were seen or not, they could not tell.\r\nNo signal came in return; only the boat--as it seemed, stern-foremost--\r\ndrove on towards them.\r\n\r\n"Hold on and get your rope ready," said the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Will she clear the rocks or no?"\r\n\r\n"We shall see.  They\'ve no oars out.  Stay there while I wave again."\r\n\r\nThis time it was not in vain.  There was a stir in the boat.  The red\r\ncloak was seen to wave aloft, and a faint cry mingled with the storm.\r\n\r\n"Hold on!" cried the doctor; "they see us, thank God.  I\'ll go on\r\nwaving."\r\n\r\nPresently they could see one oar put out, in an attempt to steer the\r\nboat into the cove.  But in a moment it was swept away, and she drove on\r\nas helplessly as before.\r\n\r\nIt seemed years while she gradually approached, stern-foremost, now\r\nseeming to lurch straight towards the fatal rocks, now to stand clear\r\nfor the narrow channel.  They could distinguish the four passengers at\r\nlast.  She in red sat in the stern looking ahead, holding her little\r\nsister at her side.  The two lads in the middle were baling out wildly,\r\npausing every now and then to turn white faces landward, but returning\r\nat once to their task.  And indeed the boat sat so low in the water that\r\nit was a miracle how she floated at all.\r\n\r\nArmstrong stood up, his friend holding him, and waved his coil of rope\r\nabove his head.  The signal was read in a moment.  The two girls\r\nretreated to the middle of the boat to make room for Roger in the stern.\r\n\r\nOn and on they came.  For an instant it seemed as if nothing could save\r\nthem, for an ugly cross wave hurled them straight towards the rocks.\r\nBut the next righted them as suddenly, lifting them high on its crest\r\nand dashing them headlong towards the one spot where help awaited them.\r\n\r\nBefore they rose again a deft cast from Armstrong had sent the rope\r\nacross the bows within Roger\'s reach, while the doctor, with the other\r\nend lashed round his body, was running at full speed towards the calmer\r\nwater of the cove.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the line hung slack, as a great back-wave lifted the boat\r\non its crest and carried it seawards.  But suddenly the strain came,\r\ncarrying the two men on shore nearly off their feet, and grinding on the\r\ngunwale of the boat with a creak which could be heard even above the\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\n"Hold on now!" cried Armstrong, as a forward wave surged up behind the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nAll obeyed but Roger, who, seeking to ease the strain, began to haul in\r\non the rope.  The wave tossed the boat up with a furious lurch, half\r\nswamping it as it did so, and flinging it down again headlong into the\r\ntrough.  When it rose once more the rope still held, and three of her\r\npassengers were safe.  But Roger was not to be seen.\r\n\r\nWith an exclamation which even the doctor, in the midst of his\r\nexcitement, could hear, Armstrong flung himself blindly into the chaos\r\nof water.  For a moment or two it seemed as if he had gone straight to\r\nhis fate, for amid the foam and lashing spray they strained their eyes\r\nin vain for a glimpse either of him or his pupil.\r\n\r\nThen he appeared high above their heads on the crest of a wave, striking\r\nout to where, for one instant, an upstretched arm and nothing more rose\r\nfeebly from the water.  The next moment, hurled thither as it seemed by\r\nthe wave, he had reached it, and was battling for dear life with the\r\nsurf that swept him back seaward.\r\n\r\nBy this time a few bystanders had ventured out on to the rocks, one of\r\nthem with a rope, which, after three vain attempts, fell within reach of\r\nthe exhausted pair.  By its aid Armstrong piloted his senseless charge\r\ninto the calmer water of the cove, and the whole party, a few moments\r\nlater, were safe on _terra firma_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nTHE CAPTAIN RELIEVES GUARD.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Armstrong, having with some difficulty taken in who and where\r\nhe was, proceeded, as was natural under the circumstances, to feel for\r\nhis eye-glass, he discovered that his right arm hung powerless at his\r\nside, and refused to perform its familiar functions.  The next thing he\r\nwas aware of was that Rosalind and the doctor were kneeling on the rocks\r\nbeside the senseless form of Roger, who lay, white as a corpse, with the\r\nblood trickling from a gash on the temple.  Then Jill crept beside him,\r\npale and sobbing, and said something, he did not hear what.  Finally the\r\nruddy countenance of Tom dawned upon him, and made him aware, even in\r\nthe midst of his dream, that one person at least had thoroughly enjoyed\r\nthe day\'s adventures, and was no whit the worse either for the fright or\r\nthe drenching.\r\n\r\nHow they all got up to Maxfield the tutor was never able to say, for the\r\npain of his broken arm became so intense that he was as near swooning as\r\nhe had ever been in his life, and but for the timely services of the\r\ndoctor, who was able to give him some little relief, he might have\r\ndisgraced himself for ever by fainting light off.  He remembered seeing\r\nRoger lying in the carriage with eyes half open, his head on Rosalind\'s\r\nshoulder.  And he remembered feeling his own hand held fast in the two\r\nhands of his little champion.\r\n\r\nThe next thing he was conscious of was that he was in his own bed, with\r\nhis arm firmly bound beside him, and the friendly face of Dr Brandram\r\nbent over him.\r\n\r\n"That\'s better, isn\'t it, old fellow?" said the latter.  "It\'s a wonder\r\nit was only the arm.  You must keep quiet now, for you shipped a lot of\r\nwater, and were a quarter drowned into the bargain."\r\n\r\n"What about Roger?"\r\n\r\n"He\'ll do now--at least I hope so.  I was concerned about him at first,\r\nbut he came round.  I envy you your plunge.  Just my luck!  All the big\r\nthings are done by the other fellows, and I\'m left to hold on to the\r\nrope and order the physic.  Never mind.  I never expected to see either\r\nof you out of that caldron.  I certainly could never have come out\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"Miss Oliphant--is she all right?"\r\n\r\n"Right as a trivet; and has mounted guard over her cousin already.  If\r\nhe doesn\'t get well with her for nurse, he\'s an obstinate, customer."\r\n\r\n"Thanks, Brandram.  Come again soon."\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant\'s concern at this untoward misadventure may well be\r\nimagined.  He shed tears with the mother over their "dear one\'s" narrow\r\nescape, and censured in terms of righteous indignation all who had been\r\nparties to the hazardous expedition.\r\n\r\nHe cross-examined the doctor as to the dangers to be apprehended from\r\nthe patient\'s present condition, and shook his head gloomily at the\r\nprobable consequences of so terrible a shock to his already fragile\r\nconstitution.  He summoned his three children into his presence to be\r\nseverally kissed in recognition of their deliverance, and sent a message\r\nby Raffles to Mr Armstrong to say that he was glad to hear his injuries\r\nwere only of a slight nature, and trusted he would take what time was\r\nnecessary from his duties to make a proper recovery.  After which, in a\r\npassably good-humour, he returned to his room, and wondered what\r\nimprovements he should make at Maxfield if, by any melancholy\r\ndispensation of Providence, the property should fall into his unworthy\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nOf course there were the usual thorns among the roses.  Mrs Ingleton,\r\nill herself, was far too painfully absorbed in her boy\'s danger to lend\r\nan ear to the tender nothings of her sympathetic kinsman.  And the whole\r\nparty were so possessed with the notion that Mr Armstrong was something\r\nof a hero, that any suggestion to the contrary was just then clearly\r\ninopportune.\r\n\r\nThe main fact, however, was that Roger Ingleton, Minor--dear lad--was\r\nvery ill indeed.\r\n\r\n"I trust, doctor," said the captain, about a fortnight after the\r\naccident, to Dr Brandram, who was quitting the house with a decidedly\r\nlong face, "I trust our dear young patient is on a good road now to\r\nrecovery."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like the look of him, I must confess," replied the doctor;\r\n"but, with perfect quiet and nothing to excite him, he will pull round.\r\nThe one thing to be dreaded is excitement.  The lungs we have got well\r\nin hand, but that blow on his temple makes an ugly complication."\r\n\r\n"Poor fellow.  Is there nothing one can do?"\r\n\r\n"Let him alone, with your sweet daughter to nurse him.  She is an angel,\r\nCaptain Oliphant, if you\'ll excuse my saying so."\r\n\r\n"She knows, as we all do, how precious his life is.  And how is your\r\nother patient?"\r\n\r\n"Armstrong?  Practically well.  I have given him leave to get up.  He\r\nhas the constitution of a tiger.  I wish we could give some of it to the\r\nboy."\r\n\r\n"Ah, indeed!" said the captain, with a sigh.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, a desire took possession of the guardian to visit\r\nhis dear ward in the sick-chamber.  Rosalind, who had clung to her post,\r\ndefiant of fatigue and sleep, had been prevailed upon in deference to\r\nher father\'s peremptory command to seize an hour\'s sleep in her own\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"I will sit with him myself," said the captain.  "You must not be\r\nselfish, my child, in using your privilege.  You forget that what\r\ngratifies you may also be a pleasure to others.  I am going to town in a\r\nfew days.  Who knows if I may see the dear fellow again."\r\n\r\n"Father!" exclaimed Rosalind, seizing his arm almost roughly; "he is\r\ngetting better.  The doctor says so."\r\n\r\n"My poor child," said her father, with a forced cheerfulness far more\r\nterrifying to the girl than his previous melancholy, "I was wrong to\r\nalarm you.  Yes, of course he is getting better; of course.  Come, we\r\nmust all be brave."\r\n\r\nRosalind, quite broken down, went to her bed and cried herself to sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen the captain entered the sick-chamber, he found the mother at the\r\nbedside.\r\n\r\n"My dear Eva," said he, "let me beg you to take a little rest.  I will\r\nremain here.  Do give me the pleasure for once.  You know how I shall\r\nvalue the privilege."\r\n\r\nMrs Ingleton, who was in truth fairly worn out, was fain to consent, on\r\ncondition that she should be called at once if necessary.\r\n\r\nHaving escorted her affectionately to the door, Captain Oliphant seated\r\nhimself at the bedside, and looked hard at his ward.\r\n\r\nThe boy lay in a feverish doze, his large dark eyes half-closed, and his\r\nhead turning now and again restlessly on the pillow.\r\n\r\n"My poor dear fellow," said his guardian, bending over him, "how do you\r\nfeel this afternoon!"\r\n\r\n"Better, I think.  Where\'s Rosalind?"\r\n\r\n"Gone to bed.  I am really afraid of her becoming ill.  She looks so\r\npale and worn."\r\n\r\n"She was so good to me," said Roger.  "I never thought of her getting\r\nill.  How long have I been ill?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Three weeks, my boy.  What a narrow escape you had.  You know I never\r\nheard yet what happened that day in the boat.  How did it all happen?"\r\n\r\nWhereupon Roger, rousing himself still more, began to go over the events\r\nof that memorable day, which at that distance of time seemed to loom out\r\nin his mind more terrible than at the time.\r\n\r\nHis guardian, deeply interested in the narrative, drew him out into a\r\nfull and particular account of all that passed: the picnic on the\r\nisland, the sudden storm, the drive before the wind, the awful roar of\r\nthe surf on the shore, what each one said and thought and prepared for,\r\nand then of the crowning excitement of the rescue, the struggle in the\r\nwater, and the drowning sensations.\r\n\r\nWhen all was told the boy\'s head fell exhausted on the pillow, his chest\r\nheaved, and he lay half muttering to himself, half moaning, a pitiful\r\nspectacle of weakness and exhaustion.\r\n\r\nWhen, an hour later, Rosalind glided in, her father walked with finger\r\nto his lips to meet her.\r\n\r\n"Make no noise," said he, "the dear lad is sleeping.  Don\'t disturb him\r\nwhatever you do."\r\n\r\nThat was a bad night in the sick-room.  The fever rose higher and\r\nhigher.  Roger tossed and moaned ceaselessly all night, and for the\r\nfirst time wandered in his talk.  Armstrong, who looked in once or\r\ntwice, durst not let himself be seen by the patient for fear of adding\r\nto his excitement.  A midnight messenger was despatched for Dr\r\nBrandram, who came, looking very grave, and remained at the bedside all\r\nnight.  Captain Oliphant was indefatigable in his inquiries and\r\nattentions.  He denied himself his natural sleep in order to linger near\r\nthe dear one\'s door and feed on the crumbs of information which from\r\ntime to time came out.  He insisted on lending Dr Brandram a pair of\r\nhis own slippers, and besought Armstrong, with his bad arm, to take care\r\nof himself and go shares in his brandy and water.\r\n\r\nFinally, when the doctor peremptorily ordered every one to bed, he\r\nretired in a chastened mood to his own room, where he packed his trunk\r\nand smoked his cigar thoughtfully till daylight struggled through the\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nThen he took a brief nap in his arm-chair, and was astir in time to meet\r\nthe doctor as he descended to the hall.\r\n\r\n"What news?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t ask me," said the doctor; "my calculations are completely upset.\r\nSomething has excited him.  Whom did he see yesterday?"\r\n\r\n"Only my daughter and his mother, and, for a short time, myself."\r\n\r\n"Was he at all disturbed while you were there?"\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, he was drowsy when I entered and drowsy when I left.\r\nHe may possibly have caught sight of Mr Armstrong when he looked in."\r\n\r\n"He should not have come near him in his present state.  Anything that\r\nreminds him of the accident is bad for him."\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear, what a pity!  No doubt the boy caught sight of him.  Tell\r\nme, doctor--may I venture up to town for a day or two on important\r\nbusiness?  If you thought I should stay--"\r\n\r\n"No.  I hope it\'s not quite as bad as that; but you should leave word\r\nwhere a message will find you, if necessary.  Good day."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not quite such a fool," growled the doctor to himself as he walked\r\nto the stables, "as you think me, my fine fellow.  If you were in the\r\nroom half an hour last night this is all explained.  To think that you\r\nare the father of that ministering angel, too!"\r\n\r\nThe captain, in a spirit of subdued cheerfulness, travelled up that\r\nafternoon to town.  The weather was superb.  The country, rich with\r\nharvest, looked beautiful.  The carriage was unusually comfortable, and\r\nthe cigars magnificent.  Altogether this good man felt that he had much\r\nto be thankful for, and quietly wondered within himself whether, on his\r\narrival at the "Langham" Hotel, he should find a telegram from Maxfield\r\nalready awaiting him.\r\n\r\nInstead, he found what pleased him decidedly less, a telegram from\r\nSouthampton.\r\n\r\n  "Business keeps me here for a week--arrive London Friday evening.\r\n\r\n  "Ratman."\r\n\r\nThe captain expressed himself to himself as greatly annoyed by this\r\nsimple message, and for the rest of that evening quite lost his natural\r\ngaiety.\r\n\r\nNext morning, however, not being a man to waste the precious hours, he\r\ndecided, like a dutiful son of his _alma mater_, to take a little run to\r\nOxford.\r\n\r\nHe had still in his pocket a certain memorandum, made long ago, of the\r\nname of a certain college at that seat of learning, at which, at a\r\ncertain date, of which he had also a note, a person in whom he felt\r\ninterested had been a student.  Why not improve the occasion by a few\r\ninquiries on the spot as to the academical career of that interesting\r\nperson?  It was a brilliant idea, no sooner conceived than executed.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, among a crowd of returning undergraduates at ---\r\nCollege, might have been seen the well-dressed military form of a\r\ncertain gentleman, who politely inquired for the senior tutor.\r\n\r\n"I have called sir, on behalf of a friend of mine in India, to inquire\r\nrespecting a Mr Frank Armstrong, who is, or was a year or two since, an\r\nundergraduate here."\r\n\r\n"Armstrong, Armstrong?--no man of that name here at present.  Ah, I\r\nfancy we had a man here of that name some years since."\r\n\r\n"Could you conveniently inform me how long it is since he left?"\r\n\r\nThe tutor referred to his lists.\r\n\r\n"He left three years ago.  I remember him now--well."\r\n\r\n"My friend would be extremely grateful for any information.  He has lost\r\nsight of him since he was at Oxford."\r\n\r\n"Well, the fact is Armstrong was not a particular success here.  He was\r\na fairly good scholar, and athlete too, I believe, but his course here\r\nended abruptly."\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear!  Do you mean to say he was expelled?"\r\n\r\n"Hardly so.  But he left the place heavily in debt.  At the end of his\r\nsecond year he wrote to the authorities to say that the source of supply\r\non which he had depended for paying his college and other bills (which\r\nhad accumulated to a very considerable extent) had suddenly ceased, and\r\nhe was unable to meet his obligations.  As he was in destitution, he\r\ncould make no suggestion for meeting them, and requested us to accept an\r\nundertaking from him to discharge them if possible at a future time.\r\nUnder the circumstances he was informed that he was not to come up\r\nagain, and his name was struck off the books.  I believe that since then\r\na few of his debts have been reduced by small instalments."\r\n\r\n"I am very grieved to hear what you tell me.  Could you very kindly tell\r\nme the address from which he last wrote?"\r\n\r\n"If I remember, it was from a coffee-house in London, and he mentioned\r\nthat he was hoping to obtain employment as a private tutor in a family."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, although this is very disagreeable news for my friend.  I am\r\nsure he will thank you all the same.  I suppose you have no idea, beyond\r\nthis address in London, what became of him?"\r\n\r\n"None."\r\n\r\n"Or where he lived before he came to Oxford?"\r\n\r\n"I was looking for that.  I see the address on the entrance form is 3,\r\nBlue Street, London."\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant made a note of the address, and after effusive thanks,\r\nsaid good-bye.\r\n\r\nHe spent two interesting days in Oxford looking about him and enjoying\r\nhimself considerably.  But although he met several men whose names he\r\nknew, and made several new acquaintances, he was unable to hear anything\r\nfurther of the defaulting undergraduate of --- College.\r\n\r\nOn his return to town, as he had still a day or two to spare, this\r\nindustrious gentleman, with a good deal of trouble, found out Number 3,\r\nBlue Street.  For a person of his refined tastes it was in a shockingly\r\nlow neighbourhood near one of the docks, and Blue Street itself was one\r\nof the shadiest--metaphorically--of its streets.\r\n\r\nIt consisted mainly of slop shops, patronised by the shipping interest,\r\nand displaying wares of which one half at least might be safely counted\r\nupon as stolen property.  Number Three, which for some unexplained\r\nreason was located half-way down the street, was an establishment of\r\nthis sort, very offensive to the nose and not at all agreeable to the\r\neye.  Old clothes of every fashion and antiquity hung exposed in the\r\ndingy window, while within a still larger assortment lay piled up on the\r\ncounter.  Nor were the clothes all.  Second-hand watches, marlinspikes,\r\ncompasses, spoons, books, boxes, and curiosities crowded the narrow\r\nspace, in the midst of which the shrivelled old lady who called herself\r\nproprietress was scarcely visible.\r\n\r\n"Come in--don\'t be afraid," cried she, as the captain paused doubtfully\r\nat the door.\r\n\r\n"Is this Number 3, my good woman?"\r\n\r\n"Look over the door--\'aint you got no eyes?"\r\n\r\n"Number 3, Blue Street--this is Blue Street, is it not?"\r\n\r\n"If yer doubts it, go and read the name at the end of the street.  What\r\ndo you want?  Clothes or money?"\r\n\r\n"Neither--I want information," replied the captain.\r\n\r\n"Then yer\'ve come to the wrong shop.  Don\'t sell it \'ere, so clear out.\r\nDo you think I don\'t know what you\'re arter?"\r\n\r\n"Very well," said the captain, "that will be so much saved.  I shall\r\nhave to get for nothing what I meant to pay for."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him doubtfully and growled.\r\n\r\n"Why can\'t yer say what yer want instead of talking gibberish there?"\r\n\r\n"If this is Number 3, Blue Street, and you are the same person who was\r\nhere five years ago--"\r\n\r\n"Go on."\r\n\r\n"I may have something to give you from an old lodger; but not till I\'m\r\nsure you have a right to it."\r\n\r\n"What, _him_?"\r\n\r\n"Very likely," said the captain, calmly lighting a cigarette.  "I shall\r\nknow if you\'re right, I dare say."\r\n\r\n"Right?  Do you suppose I\'m made of lodgers!  \'Aint you talking about\r\nthe singing chap--Armstrong he called himself, but at the Hall they\r\ncalled him Signor something--Francisco or the likes of that."\r\n\r\nThe captain pricked his ears with a vengeance, and in his eagerness\r\nrattled the keys encouragingly in his trouser pocket.\r\n\r\n"That won\'t do," said he.  "I must have come to the wrong place after\r\nall.  What sort of looking man was he, and where did he come from?"\r\n\r\n"He\'d got a pair of arms would knock you into the middle of next week,\r\nand when he went down to the Hall--"\r\n\r\n"Which Hall?"\r\n\r\n"The `Dragon\' Music-Hall--what, don\'t you know it! go on with you--when\r\nhe went there he flashed it with an eye-glass.  Lor\', you should \'ave\r\nheard him sing!  He\'d a made your hair curl; it was lovely."\r\n\r\n"Ah! he wore an eye-glass and sang, did he?" said the captain.  "And\r\nwhere did he come from, and what became of him when he left you?"\r\n\r\n"Come from?  I don\'t know.  The other end of the world, I fancy myself.\r\nWhere he went to I don\'t know neither.  I fancy myself he took up with a\r\nbad lot at the Hall, and turned me up.  Howsomever, I got my dues out of\r\nhim, so it\'s no concern of mine.  There you are, mister.  Now, what have\r\nyou got for me?"\r\n\r\nThe captain looked doubtful and shook his head.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid it\'s not right after all," said he.  "It doesn\'t correspond\r\nwith the particulars I have.  Had you no other lodgers?"\r\n\r\n"What did I tell you," snarled the woman, perceiving she was to be done\r\nout of her reward after all.  "Come, are you going to give me what you\r\npromised or not?  If you \'aint, clear out of here, my beauty, or I\'ll\r\nbreak every bone of your ugly body."\r\n\r\nAnd since, with a stick in her hand, she looked very like putting her\r\nthreat into execution, the captain beat a hasty retreat, chuckling to\r\nhimself at the thought of his own excellent cleverness.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word," said he to himself as he strolled westward, "I am having\r\na most interesting time.  What a versatile genius my co-trustee appears\r\nto be--a tutor to an heir, a defaulting and rusticated undergraduate, a\r\npenniless music-hall cad.  Dear, dear! what a curious settlement of\r\nscores we shall have, to be sure--or rather, should have had, had our\r\npoor dear Roger remained with us.  Heigho! what a curious sensation it\r\nwill be, to be sure, to own a fortune."\r\n\r\nAt the hotel the porter met him with a telegram.  He expected as much.\r\nHe could guess what was inside.  It really seemed waste of energy to\r\nopen it.\r\n\r\nBut he must go through with his melancholy functions, and he therefore\r\ntook a seat in the hall and composed his face for the worst.\r\n\r\n  "Thankful to say good night; fever abated, all hopeful.\r\n\r\n  "Rosalind."\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant turned pale, crushed the pink paper viciously in his\r\nhands, and uttered an exclamation which called forth the sympathy of the\r\nhotel servants who loitered in the hall.\r\n\r\n"Poor gentleman," said the lady manager to her clerk, "he\'s got some bad\r\nnews in that telegram."\r\n\r\nHe had indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nROBERT RATMAN, ESQUIRE, GENTLEMAN.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as Captain Oliphant, somewhat depressed by the good\r\nnews of last might was, attempting to write to his dear cousin\r\nexpression his thankfulness for the mercies vouchsafed to their precious\r\nboy, he was considerably disturbed to feel himself slapped on the\r\nshoulder and hear a voice behind him exclaim--\r\n\r\n"Got you, my man.  How are you, Teddy!"\r\n\r\nThe captain turned with, a startled face, and confronted a stylishly-\r\ndressed man of about thirty-five, who, but for the dissipated look of\r\nhis eyes and the vulgarity of his ornaments, might have passed for a\r\ngentleman.  He wore a light suit--diamonds and turquoises blazed from\r\nhis fingers, a diamond stud flashed from his shirt front, and from his\r\nheavy watch chain hung a bunch of seals and charms enough to supply half\r\na dozen, men of ordinary pretensions His light hat was tilted at an\r\nangle on his head, his brilliant kid boots sparkled beneath the snow-\r\nwhite "spats," and the lavender gloves he flourished in his hands were\r\nlight enough for a ball-room.\r\n\r\nOnce he might have been a handsome man.  There were still traces of\r\ndetermination about his mouth, his nose was finely cut, and his\r\nlustreless eyes still retained occasional flashes of their old spirit.\r\nThere was a recklessness in his face and demeanour which once, when it\r\nbelonged to an honest man, might been attractive; and when he took off\r\nhis hat and you saw the well-shaped head with its crisp curly hair, you\r\ncould not help feeling that you saw the ruin of a fine fellow.\r\n\r\nIt was when he began to talk that you would best understand what a ruin\r\nit was.  He was chary of his oaths and loose expressions--but when he\r\nspoke the words came out vulgarly, with a sleepy, half-tipsy drawl,\r\nwhich jarred on the ear.\r\n\r\nAny words from the lips of Robert Ratman, however, would have jarred on\r\nthe ears of Captain Oliphant.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you glad to see me?" said the new arrival, putting his hat\r\ncheerfully on the writing-table and helping himself to an easy-chair.\r\n"As usual, writing _billets doux_ to the ladies!  Ah, Teddy, my boy, at\r\nyour time of life too!  Now, for a youngster like me--"\r\n\r\n"I thought you would not be able to leave Southampton till the end of\r\nthe week?"\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t resist the temptation of giving you a pleasant surprise.  Why,\r\nTeddy, you look exactly as if you thought it was the arm of the law on\r\nyour shoulder and heard the rattle of the handcuffs.  Never mind.\r\nThey\'re all safe.  I know where they keep them."\r\n\r\n"Ratman," said the captain, "you have a very poor idea of humour.  You\r\nhave made me blot my letter, and I shall have to write it over again."\r\n\r\n"Take your time, old boy.  No hurry.  I shall not be going away for six\r\nmonths or so."\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant came to the conclusion he had better finish the letter\r\nwith the blot than attempt a new one.  Having done so, he put it in his\r\npocket, and turned with a good show of coolness to his guest.\r\n\r\n"When do we run down to Maxfield?" inquired the latter.\r\n\r\n"Not for some time.  There is illness in the house.  You must wait."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t mind if you don\'t.  Who is the invalid?  Young Croesus?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--dangerously ill.  I expect every day to hear that it is all over."\r\n\r\nRatman laughed.\r\n\r\n"Order two suits of black while you\'re about it.  But, Teddy, my boy,\r\ndoesn\'t it strike you you\'d be more usefully employed down there than\r\nhere?  It seems unfeeling of a guardian to be enjoying himself in town\r\nwhile his ward is _in extremis_ at home, doesn\'t it?  Who is nursing\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"My daughter, chiefly."\r\n\r\nRatman laughed coarsely.\r\n\r\n"Ho, ho, clever Teddy!  You\'ve left a deputy to look after your\r\ninterests, have you?  Poor boy--no wonder you expect news of him!"\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant, crimson and trembling, rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n"Ratman!" muttered he between his teeth, "I may be all you take me for--\r\nbut don\'t talk of my daughter.  She--she,"--and he almost choked at the\r\nword--"she is as good as I--and you--are black.  Talk about me if you\r\nlike--but forget that I have children of my own."\r\n\r\n"My dear boy, you are quite amusing.  I will make a point of forgetting\r\nthe interesting fact.  So the boy is being well looked after?"\r\n\r\n"Too well," replied the captain, pulling himself together after his last\r\noutbreak.  "The doctor is daft about him; and besides him, as I told\r\nyou, there is the tutor."\r\n\r\n"Ah!  I forgot about him.  Is he a nice sort of chap?"\r\n\r\n"He\'s your worst enemy as well as mine.  While he is about the place\r\nthere\'s no chance for either of us."\r\n\r\n"Thanks--don\'t bring me into it.  Say there\'s no chance for you.  I can\r\ntake care of myself.  And how about mamma?"\r\n\r\n"She is at present too ill and distracted by her son\'s danger to think\r\nof anything else.  If the boy dies I shall not need to trouble her.  If\r\nhe gets well, I may find it my duty to become his stepfather."\r\n\r\n"Charming man, and fortunate mamma!  Meanwhile, what are you going to do\r\nfor me?"\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, you must wait.  I can put you up at Maxfield if you\r\nbehave decently, but as to money, you will spoil all if you are\r\nimpatient.  I am not the only trustee, remember.  I have to be careful."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all very well.  Sounds beautiful.  But do you know, Teddy, I\'ve\r\nnot quite as much confidence in you as I should like to have.  I can\'t\r\nenjoy my holiday without some pocket-money.  The big lump might wait, if\r\nproperly secured.  But the interest would be very convenient to me just\r\nnow.  What shall I give you a receipt for?" added he, taking a seat at\r\nthe table; "a hundred?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a fool, Ratman!  I\'ve nothing I can give you just now," said\r\nthe captain angrily.\r\n\r\nRatman put down his pen, and whistled a stave, drubbing his fingers on\r\nthe table.  Then he took the pen again.\r\n\r\n"A hundred, eh?" he repeated.\r\n\r\nThe captain ground his teeth in impotent fury.\r\n\r\n"No.  Fifty."\r\n\r\n"Thanks very much.  I\'ll make it seventy-five, if you don\'t mind."\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant, with black countenance, slowly counted the notes out\r\nonto the table, while his friend with many flourishes wrote out the\r\nreceipt.  Before signing it he counted the money.\r\n\r\n"Quite right, perfectly right.  Thanks very much, Teddy.  Now let us go\r\nout and see the sights.  You forget it\'s years since I was in town."\r\n\r\n"Tell me first," said the captain, going to the window, was turning his\r\nback, "about that--you know--that affair in--"\r\n\r\n"About your robbing the mess-funds?" supplied his friend cheerfully.\r\n"Certainly, my dear boy.  Quite a simple matter.  Shortly after you\r\nleft, Deputy-Assistant something or other came with a long face.  `This\r\nis a bad job,\' says he; `your friend Oliphant\'s left the accounts in an\r\nawful mess.  Doesn\'t look well at all.  Where is he?\'  `Nonsense, my\r\ndear Deputy-Assistant,\' says I; `must be a mistake.  Oliphant\'s a man of\r\nhis word.  Besides, he\'s just come into a fortune.  Bound to be right if\r\nyou look into it.\'  `Will you make it good if it\'s wrong?\' asks he.\r\n`Don\'t mind if I do,\' says I, `within reason.  He\'s a young family.\'\r\n`Only way of hushing it up.  Either that or bringing him back between a\r\nfile of soldiers.\'  `You don\'t mean that?\' says I.  `What\'s the figure?\'\r\n`L750,\' says he."\r\n\r\n"Liar!" growled the captain, wheeling round.  "It wasn\'t half that."\r\n\r\n"They\'re bound to make something out of it--always happens.  Well, as\r\nyou\'d told me you\'d got the pickings of a cool half million, I felt I\r\ncouldn\'t go wrong in covering you.  So I came down with five hundred of\r\nneedful.  Got them to promise to let the rest stand till I had done\r\nmyself the pleasure of a run over here just to remind you that they have\r\nyou on their mind.  You\'ve disappointed me, Teddy, my boy, but I won\'t\r\ndesert you.  Don\'t say you\'ve no friends.  I\'ll stick by you, I rather\r\nfancy."\r\n\r\nThe captain was probably able to form a pretty clear estimate how much\r\nof this glib story was fact and how much fiction.\r\n\r\nWhatever the proportion may have been, he had to acknowledge that this\r\nfriend of his held him in an uncomfortable grip, and had better--for the\r\npresent at least--be conciliated.\r\n\r\nSo the two went out arm in arm for a stroll--the first of many they took\r\nduring their fortnight\'s sojourn in town.\r\n\r\nThe news from Maxfield became unpleasingly damping.  Here, for instance,\r\nis a letter the doting father received from his son and heir a week\r\nafter Ratman\'s arrival.\r\n\r\n"Dear Pater,--Isn\'t it fizzing that old Roger is pretty nearly out of\r\nthe wood?  The fever\'s come down like anything, and he\'s getting quite\r\nchirpy.  I can\'t fancy how a chap can hang on at all with nothing to eat\r\nbut milk.  It wouldn\'t fill up my chinks.  If ever I get a fever, keep\r\nme going on beefsteak and mashed potatoes.  It\'s been a great lark\r\nhaving no lessons.  Armstrong\'s forgotten my existence, I think.  He and\r\nRosalind have regular rows about sitting up with him--I mean Roger, and\r\nRosalind generally has to cave in.  It does her good to cave in now and\r\nthen.  Armstrong\'s the only one can make her.  I can\'t; nor can\r\nBrandram.  Brandram\'s a stunner.  I drive him in and out of Yeld every\r\nday, and he\'s up to no end of larks.  And now Roger\'s pulling round,\r\nhe\'s as festive as an owl.  Jill\'s in jolly dumps because she\'s out of\r\nit all.  Rosalind sits on her and tells her she\'s too much of a kid to\r\nbe any good; and she doesn\'t get much change out of Armstrong.  So she\r\nhas to knock about with me all day, which is awful slow.  I say, go and\r\nsee Christy\'s Minstrels when you\'re in town, and get them to let\r\nJockabilly do the break-down.  It will make you split.  If that French\r\nchap is hanging about, tip him a bob for me and be civil to him, because\r\nhe was decent enough to me.  Auntie Eva said something about your\r\nbringing a gentleman home with you.  I hope he\'s a jolly sort of chap.\r\nRosalind\'s temper is all anyhow.  When I told her a visitor was coming,\r\nshe shut me up with a regular flea in my ear.  Never mind, she\'s been a\r\nbrick to old Roger and Auntie Eva, so we must make allowances.  Old\r\nHodder calls up nearly every day to ask after us all.  He\'s grown quite\r\nyoung since he was left alone in his cottage, and Armstrong came down\r\nlike a sack of coals on that beast Pottinger.  My dear father, if you\r\nwould like to know what I most hope you\'ll bring home for me, it\'s a\r\nfootball--Rugby--for the coming winter.  Armstrong\'s promised to coach\r\nme in the drop kick.  Can you do it?  I shall be glad to see you home,\r\nas I\'m jolly low in pocket-money, besides the affection one feels for\r\nthose who are absent.  Jill joins in love.\r\n\r\n"Your affectionate `Tom.\'\r\n\r\n"_P.S_.--Auntie Eva is not nearly so down on her luck now that Roger\'s\r\ntaken his turn.  If he\'s well enough she\'s going to have a little kick-\r\nup on his birthday, which will be rare larks."\r\n\r\n"A letter!" inquired Ratman, who had watched the not altogether\r\ndelighted expression on his friend\'s face as he read it.  "Good news?\r\nMay I read it?"\r\n\r\n"If you like," said the captain, tossing it across the table.\r\n\r\nRatman, who evidently had a better appreciation of juvenile vagaries\r\nthan the father, read it with an amused smile on his face.\r\n\r\n"Nice boy that," said he; "he and I will be friends."\r\n\r\n"Remember," said the captain, "our bargain.  Do and say what you like\r\nwith me, but before my children--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be afraid, Teddy, my boy.  Depend on me for doing the high moral\r\nbusiness.  The innocent babes shall never guess that you owe me three\r\nyears\' pay, and that I could walk you off to the next police station for\r\na sharper.  It\'s amusing when you come to think of it, isn\'t it?  But, I\r\nsay, it looks as if you\'ll have to trouble mamma after all.  The boy\'s\r\ngetting well in spite of his nurses.  I\'m really impatient to see the\r\nhappy family.  When shall we go?"\r\n\r\n"Next week.  We must be decent, and wait till he\'s better now."\r\n\r\n"Oh, all right.  If we can\'t go to the funeral we\'ll go to the birthday\r\nparty, eh?  It\'s all one to me, Teddy, as long as you don\'t make a fool\r\nof me in the long run."\r\n\r\n"You wait, and it\'ll be all right," said the captain, with a trace in\r\nhis voice of something like desperation.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the following week these two nice gentlemen presented\r\nthemselves at Maxfield.  Captain Oliphant had written for the brougham\r\nto meet them, and as Tom and Jill were in it, Mr Ratman was spared the\r\nembarrassment of meeting the whole household at one time.  Before the\r\nhouse was reached he had impressed Tom with the conviction that there\r\nwas a considerable possibility of "larks" in his father\'s visitor.  But\r\nJill, who had acquired the habit of contrasting every gentleman she saw\r\nwith her dear Mr Armstrong, was obdurate to his fascinations.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to talk to you," said she shortly, when for the twentieth\r\ntime he renewed his friendly overtures.  "I don\'t like you, and hope\r\nyou\'re not going to stay long."\r\n\r\nRatman took his rebuff as complacently as he could; and Jill, having\r\nexhausted her conversation with this outburst, put her hand\r\napologetically into her father\'s, and remained silent the rest of the\r\ndrive.\r\n\r\nAt Maxfield, the visitor, who appeared to experience no difficulty in\r\nmaking himself at home, received a polite welcome from the widow, whose\r\nstyle he generally approved, and considered a good deal better than his\r\ngallant comrade deserved.  Then, as none of the rest of the household\r\nput in an appearance, he retired serenely to his comfortable apartment\r\nto dress for dinner.\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant\'s first anxiety was naturally for his dear young ward.\r\nHe found him sitting up in an arm-chair, with Rosalind reading\r\nShakespeare to him.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, guardian!" said he, "you see the place hasn\'t got rid of me\r\nyet--thanks to my kind nurse here."\r\n\r\n"I am indeed thankful, my dear boy, for your recovery.  And how is my\r\nRosalind?"\r\n\r\nShe came and kissed him.\r\n\r\n"Very well, dear father.  But Roger has to keep very quiet still, so you\r\nmust only stay a minute or two, or I shall get into disgrace with the\r\ndoctor.  He has been so good.  Have you seen cousin Eva?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my child.  But come with me; I want to introduce you to Mr\r\nRatman."\r\n\r\nShe looked inclined to rebel, but after a moment closed her book, and,\r\nhaving smoothed the invalid\'s cushions, followed her father from the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe captain felt decidedly nervous as she walked silently at his side.\r\nAt her own door she paused abruptly and said--\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you come in, father?  I want to say something to you."\r\n\r\n"A storm brewing," said the captain to himself.  "I expected it."\r\n\r\nHe followed her into her studio and closed the door.\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"I am going to leave Maxfield, father.  I cannot stay here any longer,\r\nliving on other people.  I am going to accept an engagement at the\r\nvicarage as governess."\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed her father.  "What freak is this, miss?  I forbid you\r\nto do anything of the kind."\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry you don\'t approve.  I thought you would.  It will\r\nenable me to support myself, and perhaps help to keep Jill.  I shall get\r\nmy board and lodging, and L30 a year, I am going on Monday.  I wanted to\r\ntell you before any one else knew of it."\r\n\r\n"I repeat you must abandon the idea at once.  It is most derogatory in\r\none of our family.  In addition to which, I particularly desire to have\r\nyou here during Mr Ratman\'s visit."\r\n\r\n"It is chiefly on that account I have decided to go.  It is not right,\r\nfather, indeed it is not, to go on as we are."\r\n\r\nShe put her hands on his shoulders and kissed him, and looked into his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nIt was an ordeal on which Captain Edward Oliphant had not calculated.\r\nThe sight of her there, the touch of her hands, the clear flash of her\r\neyes, recalled to him all sorts of unpleasant memories.  They reminded\r\nhim of a day long ago, when the girl\'s mother had stood thus and pleaded\r\nwith him for the sake of their children to be pure and honest and self-\r\nrespecting.  It reminded him of his own miserable schemings and follies,\r\nand how he had rejected that dear appeal, and ever since slipped and\r\nslipped out of reach of any love but the love of himself.  It reminded\r\nhim of the day when he heard that the one prop of his manhood had gone\r\nfrom him; and of how, even then, his sorrow was tempered by the thought\r\nthat he was a free man to follow his own paths without question or\r\nreproof.  Now, suddenly, the same hands seemed for a moment to lie on\r\nhis shoulders, the same eyes to look into his, the same voice to fall on\r\nhis ear, and he staggered under the illusion.\r\n\r\nFor a moment at least hope was within his reach.  But the sound of a\r\nman\'s voice in the passage without recalled him, with a shiver, to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIt was Ratman\'s voice--the voice of the man to whom he owed money, who\r\nheld the secret of his crime, who claimed his villainy and--who could\r\nsay?--might even have to be pacified with a human sacrifice.\r\n\r\nHe shook her off rudely and said in dry, hard tones--\r\n\r\n"Rosalind, I am disappointed in you.  I will not discuss the matter with\r\nyou.  You know my wish; I expect you to obey me."\r\n\r\nAnd he left the room.\r\n\r\nShe remained standing where she was till the bell rang for dinner.  Then\r\nwith a shiver she went down-stairs.\r\n\r\nOn the stairs she met Mr Armstrong.\r\n\r\n"Your father has returned," said he.\r\n\r\n"Yes, with a friend.  Are you going down, or shall you stay with Roger?"\r\n\r\n"May I?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"You know how glad he will be."\r\n\r\nSo the tutor turned back, and thought to himself that Miss Rosalind was\r\nevidently anxious that he should not be a witness to her introduction to\r\nher father\'s friend.\r\n\r\nMr Ratman, brilliantly arranged in evening dress, and evidently already\r\nvery much at home, was comfortably leaning against the mantelpiece in\r\nthe hall as she descended.  He did not wait for an introduction.\r\n\r\n"I could tell Miss Oliphant anywhere," said he, advancing, "by her\r\nlikeness to her father.  May I offer you my arm?"\r\n\r\n"I am not at all like father," said she quietly, scanning him as she\r\nspoke in a way which made even him uncomfortable, and then putting her\r\nhand on her father\'s arm.\r\n\r\nThus repulsed, the visitor cheerfully offered his arm to Mrs Ingleton,\r\ncongratulating her as he did so on the recovery of her son.\r\n\r\nDuring the meal he was aware that the young lady\'s eyes were completing\r\ntheir scrutiny, and although, being a bashful man, he did not venture\r\ntoo often to meet them with his own, he was conscious that the result\r\nwas not altogether satisfactory to himself.  His few attempts to talk to\r\nher fell flat, and in spite of the captain\'s almost nervous attempts to\r\nimprove the festivity of the occasion, the meal was an uncomfortable\r\none.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s old Armstrong?" demanded Tom.\r\n\r\n"With Roger," replied Rosalind.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen Armstrong?" inquired the boy of the visitor; "he\'s a\r\nstunner, I can tell you.  He can bend a poker double across his knee.\r\nYou\'ll like him awfully; and he plays the piano like one o\'clock.  He\'s\r\nour tutor, you know--no end of a chap."\r\n\r\nMr Ratman was fain to express a longing desire to make the acquaintance\r\nof so redoubtable a hero.\r\n\r\n"Does he lick you?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes, when it\'s wanted; but, bless you, he could take the lot of\r\nus left-handed; couldn\'t he, Jill?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes," said Jill enthusiastically; "and he saved Roger\'s life, and\r\nprevented Hodder being turned out, and won such a lot of prizes at\r\nOxford."\r\n\r\n"He must be a fine fellow," said Ratman, with a disagreeable laugh.\r\n"You admire him too, of course, Miss Oliphant?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he\'s honest," said she.\r\n\r\n"Teddy, my boy," said the visitor, when he and his friend had been left\r\nalone at the table, "that girl of yours is a treasure.  She don\'t fancy\r\nme, but she\'ll get over that.  I like her, Teddy; I like her."\r\n\r\nThat evening, on his way to say good night to his dear ward, Captain\r\nOliphant stopped at his daughter\'s door.\r\n\r\nShe was hard at work over a picture.\r\n\r\n"Rosalind," said he, "you have disappointed me.  But if your mind is\r\nmade up, I know it is no use my setting up my authority against your\r\nself-will.  Therefore, to relieve you of the sin of disobedience to your\r\nfather\'s wishes, I withdraw my refusal to your proposal.  You may do as\r\nyou like.  Good night!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nAWKWARD QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nThe sun, when it peeped through the blinds next morning, found Mr\r\nRobert Ratman wide awake.  His was one of those active minds which do\r\nnot waste unnecessary time in sluggish repose, but, on the contrary, do\r\na principal part of their most effective brain-work while other people\r\nare asleep.\r\n\r\n"Snug enough so far," said he to himself, turning over on his side.\r\n"The place will suit me after all.  Capital table, easy-going hostess,\r\ncharming young Bohemian to amuse me, money going about, and all that.\r\nTeddy wants stirring up.  I shall have to flick him a bit.  He\'ll go\r\nwell enough when he\'s once started, but he\'s wasting his time here\r\ndisgracefully.  Eight months since he came, and absolutely nothing done!\r\nThe boy\'s not buried, the mother\'s not married, and the tutor\'s not had\r\nhis month\'s notice, (Like to see this precious tutor, by the way.)  Upon\r\nmy honour, it\'s about time I came and opened shop here."\r\n\r\nAnd with a grunt he got out of bed, and began to array himself\r\npreparatory to a stroll round the park before breakfast.\r\n\r\nIt was a delicious September morning.  The birds, hardly convinced that\r\nthe summer was over, were singing merrily in the trees.  The hum of the\r\nnot distant ocean droned solemnly in the air.  The sunlight played\r\nfitfully with the gold of the harvest fields, and the lowing cattle in\r\nthe meadows added their music to nature\'s peaceful morning anthem.\r\n\r\nMr Ratman was only half alive to the beauties of nature.  He was\r\nconsiderably more impressed with the substantial masonry of the manor\r\nhouse, with the size of the timber, the appointments of the stables, and\r\nthe acreage of the park.  They all spelt money to him--suggesting a good\r\ndeal more behind.\r\n\r\n"Teddy\'s certainly a man to be looked after," said he to himself.  "He\'s\r\nwasting his time scandalously.  Yet he\'s clever in his way, is Edward.\r\nHe has tucked his family into the big bed snugly, and made the most of\r\nhis chance that way.  Why--"\r\n\r\nHe had reached this pleasant stage in his reflections when something\r\ndarted round from a side-walk and collided with him suddenly.\r\n\r\nIt was Miss Jill, taking an early scamper with her dog, and little\r\ndreaming that she was not, as usual, the sole occupant of the grounds.\r\n\r\n"Hullo! my little lady," said Mr Ratman, recognising his enemy of\r\nyesterday; "you nearly did for me that time.  Come, you\'ll have to tell\r\nme you are sorry, and beg my pardon very prettily."\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t!" exclaimed Jill, and proceeded to run.\r\n\r\nMr Ratman was not beyond a bit of fun himself; besides, he did not\r\nquite like to be thus set down by a child of twelve.  Therefore,\r\nalthough his running days had passed their prime, he gave chase, and a\r\nvery exciting race ensued.\r\n\r\nJill, as fleet as the wind, darted forward with little to fear from her\r\npursuer; while the dog, naturally regarding the whole affair as an\r\nentertainment got up for his benefit, barked jubilantly, and did his\r\nbest to force the pace.  After a minute or two Mr Ratman began to\r\nwonder if the game was worth the candle, and was turning over in his\r\nmind the awkward possibility of owning himself beaten, when he perceived\r\nthat the little fugitive was, by some error of judgment on her part,\r\nleading the way into what looked uncommonly like a _cul de sac_.\r\nTherefore, although painfully aware of the stitch in his side, he\r\nbravely held on, and had the gratification in a minute more of running\r\nhis little victim to earth after all.\r\n\r\n"Aha!" said he, laughing and panting; "you can\'t get away from me, you\r\nsee.  Now, my little beauty, I\'m going to take you back in custody to\r\nthe place where you started from, and make you beg my pardon very\r\nprettily for nearly knocking me over."\r\n\r\nIn vain Jill protested and struggled; he held her by the wrist as with a\r\nvice, and, rather enjoying her wild efforts to escape, literally\r\nproceeded to carry his threat into execution.\r\n\r\nHe had nearly brought her back to the starting-place, and she, having\r\nfought and struggled all the way, was beginning with humiliation to feel\r\nher eyes growing dim with tears, when a gentleman dressed in boating\r\nflannels, with one arm in a sling and an eye-glass in his eye, stepped\r\nabruptly across the path.\r\n\r\nA moment later Mr Robert Ratman lay on the grass half a dozen yards\r\naway, on the flat of his back, blinking up at the sky.\r\n\r\nSeveral curious reflections passed through his mind as he occupied this\r\nnot very exhilarating position.  Jill had escaped after all.  That was\r\nannoying.  He should have a black eye for a week.  That was very\r\nannoying.  This left-handed individual with the eye-glass must be the\r\ntutor.  That was most excessively annoying.\r\n\r\nAnd the injured gentleman, neither looking nor feeling at all well,\r\npulled himself together and sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\nJill was there, clinging to her champion.  "Run away, Jill!" said\r\nArmstrong.\r\n\r\n"But you have only one arm," said she.  "Go, Jill!" said he, so\r\ndecisively that the little maid, darting only one look behind her, fled\r\ntowards the house.\r\n\r\nAll she saw was the two men facing one another--one flurried, vicious,\r\nand noisy; the other curious, silent, disgusted.\r\n\r\n"You dog!" hissed Ratman, with an oath, "what do you mean by that?"\r\n\r\n"My meaning should have been clear--it was intended to be."\r\n\r\nRatman tried hard to copy his adversary\'s composure, but failed\r\nmiserably.\r\n\r\nWith many imprecations, and, heedless of the tutor\'s maimed condition,\r\nhe threw himself upon him.\r\n\r\nBut Robert Ratman\'s boxing, like his running, was a trifle out of date,\r\nand once more he found himself on his back regarding the clouds as they\r\nflitted by overhead.\r\n\r\nThis time the tutor assumed the initiative.\r\n\r\n"Get up," said he, advancing to his prostrate antagonist.\r\n\r\nRatman was surprised at himself when, after a moment\'s doubt, he obeyed.\r\n\r\n"What\'s your name?" demanded Mr Armstrong, surveying him from head to\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nAgain, by some curious mental process, Mr Ratman obeyed.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing down here?"\r\n\r\n"I am Captain Oliphant\'s guest," growled Ratman.\r\n\r\nThe tutor looked him up and down in a manner which was clearly not\r\ncalculated to imply admiration of Captain Oliphant\'s choice of friends.\r\n\r\n"Allow me to tell you, sir, that in this part of the world we call men\r\nlike you blackguards."\r\n\r\nAnd the tutor, whose eye-glass had become uncomfortably deranged during\r\nthis brief interview, screwed it in with a wrench, and turned on his\r\nheel.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s jolly old Ratman?" inquired Tom, when the family presently\r\nassembled for breakfast.\r\n\r\n"Tired with his journey, no doubt," said Mrs Ingleton.\r\n\r\nAs no one disputed this theory, and Jill\'s exchange of glances with her\r\nchampion passed unheeded, there seemed every prospect of the meal\r\npassing off peaceably.  But Tom, as usual, contrived to improve the\r\noccasion in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll like him, Armstrong, when you see him.  He\'s no end of a chap--\r\nall larks.  He\'ll make you roar with his rummy stories."\r\n\r\n"I have met him already," said the tutor shortly.\r\n\r\n"Then he is up.  Jill, my child," said the captain, "go and knock at Mr\r\nRatman\'s door, and tell him breakfast is ready."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t go near him," said Jill, flushing up.  "He\'s a horrid, hateful\r\nman.  Isn\'t he, Mr Armstrong?"\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong, thus appealed to, looked a little uncomfortable, and\r\nnodded.\r\n\r\n"Yes," blurted the girl; "and if it hadn\'t been for Mr Armstrong,\r\nfather, he might have hurt me very much."\r\n\r\n"Explain yourself," said the fond father, becoming interested.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to talk about him," said Jill.\r\n\r\n"What does all this mean, Armstrong?"\r\n\r\n"As far as I am concerned, it means that I took the liberty of knocking\r\nMr Ratman down for insulting your daughter.  I am sorry you were not\r\npresent to do it yourself."\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant turned white, and red, and black in succession.\r\n\r\n"You knocked a visitor of mine--"\r\n\r\n"Down twice," said the tutor, helping himself to sugar.\r\n\r\n"Oh, what a lark!" exclaimed Tom.  "Oh, I wish I\'d been up too.  Was it\r\na good mill, I say?  How many rounds?  Six?  Why ever didn\'t you come\r\nand tell me, Jill?"\r\n\r\n"Be quiet, Tom," said Jill.\r\n\r\n"Did you get him clean on the jaw, I say?" persisted Tom, "like the\r\none--"\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, sir," said his father peremptorily.  "Mr Armstrong,\r\nI must ask you to explain this matter later; this is not the place for\r\nsuch talk."\r\n\r\n"Quite so.  I regret the matter was referred to.  Tom, be good enough to\r\npass Miss Oliphant the toast."\r\n\r\nTom could scarcely be induced to take the hint, and talked at large on\r\nthe science of boxing during the remainder of the meal with an access of\r\nhigh spirits which, on any other occasion, would have been amusing.\r\n\r\nMr Ratman, later in the day, appeared with a decidedly marred visage,\r\nand announced with the best grace he could that an important business\r\nletter that morning necessitated his return to London.\r\n\r\nIn private he explained himself more fully to his host.\r\n\r\n"If this is what you call making me comfortable," growled he, with an\r\nunusual number of oaths interspersed in his sentence, "you\'ve a pretty\r\nnotion of your own interests."\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, how could I help it?"\r\n\r\n"You can help it now, and you\'ll have to.  I may be only a creditor, but\r\nI\'ll let you see I am not going to be treated in this house like a dog,\r\nfor all that."\r\n\r\n"The awkward thing is that if you had behaved--"\r\n\r\n"Shut up about how I behaved," snarled the other.  "You\'ll have to clear\r\nthat cad out of the way here.  I\'ll not come back till you do; and till\r\nI do come back you\'re sitting on a volcano."\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, you will spoil everything if you take such an absurd\r\nview of the matter--really you will.  Of course I\'ll put you right.  You\r\nare my guest.  But remember my difficult position here."\r\n\r\n"It will be a precious deal more difficult for you soon.  I can promise\r\nyou," said Mr Ratman, lifting his hand to his swollen eye with an oath.\r\n"Now then, I\'ll give you a month.  If you\'re not rid of this fellow by\r\nthen, and aren\'t a good deal nearer than you are now to squaring up with\r\nme, you\'ll be sorry you ever heard my name."\r\n\r\n"I\'m that already," said the captain.  "I can promise nothing; but I\'ll\r\ndo what I can."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to do more, if you\'re to get rid of me.  How about money?"\r\n\r\nThis abrupt question fairly staggered the captain, who broke out--\r\n\r\n"Money!  Didn\'t you drain me of every penny I had in London?"\r\n\r\nThe fellow laughed coarsely.\r\n\r\n"What did you drain the regimental mess of, I should like to know?  You\r\nneedn\'t think you\'re out of that wood.  Now, I shall want L200 for my\r\nmonth in town.  I mean to enjoy myself."\r\n\r\nThe captain laughed dismally.  "Where are you going to get it from?"\r\n\r\n"You.  Look sharp!"\r\n\r\n"I tell you, Ratman, I haven\'t any money.  You can\'t get blood out of a\r\nstone."\r\n\r\n"Then you must give me a bill--at a month."\r\n\r\n"No, no!  I won\'t begin that," said the captain, who had fibre enough\r\nleft in him to know that a bill was the first plunge into an unknown\r\nregion of financial difficulty.  "If you\'re bent on ruining me in any\r\ncase, for heaven\'s sake do it at once and have done with it.  Remember,\r\nyou bring down more than me.  Whatever I may be, they don\'t deserve it."\r\n\r\n"For their sake, then, give me the bill.  Bless you, any one can put his\r\nhand to paper.  Consider yourself lucky I don\'t insist on taking it out\r\nin hard cash."\r\n\r\nIt was no use arguing or protesting with a man like this.  The captain\r\nflung himself miserably into a chair and scrawled out the ill-omened\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\nRatman snatched it up with a grunt of triumph.\r\n\r\n"That\'s more like," said he.  "What\'s the use of all that fuss?  Plenty\r\nof things can happen in a month.  Order the dogcart in half an hour."\r\n\r\nThe abrupt departure of Captain Oliphant\'s guest might have excited more\r\nremark than it did, had not another departure from Maxfield that same\r\nday thrown it somewhat into the shade.\r\n\r\nTrue to her promise, or rather threat, Miss Rosalind had packed up her\r\nthings and had them transported to the Vicarage.\r\n\r\nIt was not without a pang that she uprooted herself from her\r\nsurroundings in Maxfield, or bore the protests of Roger, the tears of\r\nJill, and the chaff of Tom for her desertion.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not that you\'re not all awfully kind," said she to the first that\r\nafternoon, when the party was assembled in his room.  "You are too\r\nkind--that\'s why I\'m going."\r\n\r\n"If a little of the opposite treatment would induce you to stay," said\r\nRoger, "I\'d gladly try it.  Don\'t you think it\'s a little unkind of her\r\nto go when we all want her to stay--eh, Armstrong?"\r\n\r\n"That depends," said Mr Armstrong diplomatically.  "I should be\r\ninclined to say no, myself."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Mr Armstrong, I\'m glad I\'ve got one person to back me up.\r\nEvery one else is down on me--auntie, father, Roger, Jill, Tom--"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not down on you," put in Tom.  "I think it\'s rather larks your\r\ngoing to the Vicarage.  No more of that beastly art class for us.  But\r\nif you want to know who\'s down on you, it\'s jolly old Ratman.  I\'ve just\r\nbeen to see him off in the tantrums to London.  I asked him to be sure\r\nand be back for Roger\'s birthday, and he said he\'d try, if his black eye\r\nwas well enough.  That must have been a ripping clean shot of yours,\r\nArmstrong.  He\'ll get over it all right, you bet.  He was grinning about\r\nit already, and said he\'d have a return some day.  I asked him if he\r\ndidn\'t think Rosalind was a stunner (one\'s got to be civil to fellows,\r\nyou know), and he said `Rather,\' and envied the kids at the Vicarage.  I\r\ndon\'t.  You always make yourself jolly civil to other people, but I\r\ndon\'t come in for much of it, nor does Jill."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t bear your going away," said Jill, with tears in her eyes; "I\'ll\r\nbe so lonely.  But it would be far worse if Mr Armstrong were to go\r\naway too.  You\'ll stay, won\'t you, dear Mr Armstrong?"\r\n\r\nDear Mr Armstrong jerked his eye-glass by way of assent, and said he\r\nwas sure everybody would miss Miss Oliphant and-- and he would say good-\r\nbye now, as he had some letters to get off by the post.\r\n\r\nMiss Rosalind, who had just been thinking a little kindly of the tutor,\r\nstiffened somewhat at this abrupt exit, and thought Mr Armstrong might\r\nat least have offered to escort her over to her new quarters.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, that poor gentleman would have given a finger off his\r\nhand for the chance, and retired to his room very dejected about the\r\nwhole business--so dejected that he fidgeted about his room a good while\r\nbefore he noticed a note addressed to himself, in Captain Oliphant\'s\r\nhand, lying on the table.  He opened it and read--\r\n\r\n  "Mr Frank Armstrong is informed that his services as tutor to Roger\r\n  Ingleton will not be required after this day month, the 25th _prox_.\r\n  Mr Armstrong is at liberty to remain at Maxfield until that date, or\r\n  may leave at once on accepting a month\'s wages in lieu of notice.--For\r\n  the Executors of Roger Ingleton,--\r\n\r\n  "Edward Oliphant."\r\n\r\nThe tutor\'s lips curled into a grim smile as he perused this pleasing\r\ndocument, and then tossed it into the waste-paper basket.  He relieved\r\nhis feelings with a few chords on the piano, and then, after a few more\r\nuneasy turns in his room, went off to call on his co-trustee.\r\n\r\nOn his way down-stairs he met Rosalind and her escort about to take\r\ntheir departure.\r\n\r\n"Come along with us, do!" said Tom.  "We\'re just going to trot Rosalind\r\nover to her diggings, and then we can have a high old lark in the\r\npaddock on our way back."\r\n\r\n"The programme is not attractive, Thomas," said the tutor.  "Good-bye\r\nagain, Miss Oliphant."\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant had already bidden his daughter a tender farewell, and\r\nwas enjoying a cigar in the library.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said he, as the tutor entered, "you got my note, did you, sir?"\r\n\r\n"I did, thanks."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir?"\r\n\r\n"That was the question I was about to ask you.  Excuse my saying it, but\r\nit was a very foolish note for a man in your position to write.  Did\r\nMrs Ingleton--"\r\n\r\n"Mrs Ingleton has decided, on my advice, to send her son to Oxford.  I\r\nhave recently been there, and made inquiries."\r\n\r\n"Indeed!  I\'ll join you in your smoke, if you don\'t mind," and the tutor\r\ndrew a chair up to the table and filled his pipe.\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant was considerably disconcerted at this cool reception of\r\nhis piece of news; but, warned by previous experiences, he forbore to\r\nbluster.\r\n\r\n"I think the life will suit him.  He is wasting his time here."\r\n\r\n"If his health improves sufficiently," said the tutor, "there is a good\r\ndeal to be said in favour of the University."\r\n\r\n"You think so, do you?" said his co-guardian drily.  "You are an Oxford\r\nman yourself, I understand."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I was at --- College."\r\n\r\n"So I heard from a friend of mine there, who remembered your name."\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong twitched his glass a little and puffed away.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the captain, encouraged by this slight symptom of\r\nuneasiness; "I heard a good deal about you up there, as it happened."\r\n\r\n"Kind of you to take so much interest in me.  You ascertained, of\r\ncourse, that I left Oxford in debt and without a degree?"\r\n\r\nThis was check again for the captain, who had counted upon this\r\ndiscovery as an effective bombshell for his side.\r\n\r\n"As regards Roger, however," proceeded the tutor, reaching across for\r\nthe captain\'s ash-tray, "I would advise Balliol in preference to--"\r\n\r\n"We shall not need to trouble you for your advice."\r\n\r\n"But I shall most certainly give it."\r\n\r\nBy this time Captain Oliphant\'s self-control was rapidly evaporating.\r\nHe was beginning to feel himself a little small, and that always annoyed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Mr Frank Armstrong," said he, leaning back in his chair,\r\nand trying hard to look superior, "it is just as well for you and me to\r\nunderstand one another.  I have heard what sort of figure you cut at\r\nOxford, and the disgrace in which you left the University.  Allow me to\r\nsay, sir, that it reflects little credit on your honour that you should\r\nhave imposed on your late employer, and taken advantage of his weak\r\nhealth and faculties to foist yourself upon his family under false\r\ncolours."\r\n\r\n"Will you oblige me with a light?" interposed Mr Armstrong.\r\n\r\n"You are under a delusion if you think I am not perfectly well\r\nacquainted with your disreputable antecedents.  Let me tell you, sir,\r\nthat a music-hall cad is not a fitting companion for a lad of Roger\'s\r\nrank and expectations."\r\n\r\n"I perfectly agree with you.  But really this has very little to do with\r\nour arrangements for Roger\'s future."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to deny, sir, that you were a music-hall singer?"\r\n\r\n"By no means.  I was.  On the whole, I rather enjoyed the vocation at\r\nthe time.  I look upon that and the year (about which you apparently\r\nhave not been fortunate enough to learn anything) during which I was\r\ntutor and private secretary in the family of the Hon.  James Welcher--\r\nthe most notorious blackleg in the kingdom--as two of the most\r\ninteresting episodes in my career."\r\n\r\n"I can believe it.  And, before you devoted your energies to singing\r\ndisreputable songs to the blackguards of the East End--"\r\n\r\n"Pardon me.  I was particular.  My songs were for the most part of the\r\nclassical order; but what were you saying?"\r\n\r\n"I was saying," said the captain, now fairly dropping the dignified, and\r\nfalling back on the abusive, "what were you before that?"\r\n\r\n"Really, Captain Oliphant, you have been so acute and successful so far,\r\nI would not on any account deprive you of the satisfaction of\r\ndiscovering what little more remains to complete my humble biography by\r\nyour own exertions.  Meanwhile, as to Roger\'s college; had you leisure\r\nwhen at Oxford to make any inquiries as to that rather important\r\nquestion?"\r\n\r\n"Oblige me by addressing your conversation to some one else, sir.  I am\r\nnot disposed to be asked questions by an adventurer and sharper, who--"\r\n\r\nThe tutor\'s face blackened, the glass fell from his eye, and he rose to\r\nhis feet so suddenly that the chair on which he had been sitting fell\r\nback violently.\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant turned pale and started to his feet too in an attitude\r\nof self-defence and retreat.  But the tutor only walked over to the\r\nfireplace to knock out his ashes into the fender, and then, resuming his\r\nglass, said quietly--\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon; I interrupted you."  Captain Oliphant did not pursue\r\nthe subject, and presently retired, leaving his co-trustee master of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n"Strange," said the latter to himself when the enemy had gone, "what a\r\nlook he has of his daughter.  The resemblance was distinctly fortunate\r\nfor him five minutes ago."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nA WINDFALL FOR THE CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nThe impending birthday festivities at Maxfield were a topic of interest\r\nto others than merely the residents at the manor-house.  There, indeed,\r\nthe prospect was considerably damped by the failing health of Mrs\r\nIngleton and the absence of Rosalind from the scene of action.  The\r\nburden of the arrangements fell upon the tutor, who only half relished\r\nthe duties of _major domo_, and heartily wished the uncomfortable date\r\nwas past.  Mrs Ingleton, however, ill as she was, was intent on\r\ncelebrating the occasion in a manner becoming the hospitable traditions\r\nof the house of which her son was now the head, and accordingly, a large\r\nparty of the neighbouring gentry was invited for the occasion.\r\n\r\nAmong the uninvited guests one individual was anticipating the event\r\nwith considerable interest.  This was Robert Ratman, Esquire, as he\r\nlounged comfortably on a sofa at the "Grand Hotel" in London, and\r\nperused a letter which had just reached him by the post.\r\n\r\n"I shall have to get you to take another bill in place of the one I gave\r\nyou, due on the 26th.  The fact is, I forgot that was the day of my\r\nward\'s twentieth birthday, when there are to be celebrations at\r\nMaxfield," ("What on earth has that to do with it?" grunted the reader).\r\n"If you will take my advice you will postpone your return here till\r\nafter that date.  In any case, please understand I am unable to attend\r\nto money matters at present.  It may interest you to know that the tutor\r\nis under notice to leave," (here the reader uttered a not very\r\ncomplimentary expletive), "also that I am on the best of terms with the\r\nfair widow.\r\n\r\n"E.O."\r\n\r\n"Thinks I\'m a fool, does he?" grunted Mr Ratman; "I shall have to\r\nundeceive him there."\r\n\r\nSo he laid down his cigar and wrote--\r\n\r\n  "Dear Teddy,--It sounds very nice, but it\'s not good enough.  You\'ve\r\n  mistaken your man, my boy.  You\'ll have to stump up L100 on the day,\r\n  and I\'ll wait a month for the rest and interest.  I shall be on the\r\n  spot to receive it and join in the festivities.  If you are not lying,\r\n  you deserve credit for getting rid of the tutor.  See he is packed off\r\n  before I come; and see I get no more impertinence from those brats of\r\n  yours, unless you wish trouble to their father.\r\n\r\n  "Yours,--\r\n\r\n  "R.R."\r\n\r\nThe receipt of this genial epistle considerably marred the pleasure with\r\nwhich Captain Oliphant looked forward to the approaching festivities at\r\nMaxfield.\r\n\r\nIt had been bad enough to have the Oxford scheme and all it involved\r\nfall through.  Roger had explained in his pleasant manner that he was\r\nnot disposed to accept his guardian\'s advice as to a University course\r\nat present; and as his decision was backed up by both Mrs Ingleton and\r\nMr Armstrong, the poor man found himself in a minority, and no nearer a\r\nsolution to his difficulties than before.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, Roger was every day recovering health, and, in\r\nRosalind\'s absence, devoting himself more loyally than ever to his\r\ntutor\'s direction and instruction.\r\n\r\nAltogether Captain Oliphant had a dismal consciousness of being out in\r\nthe cold.  His carefully thought cut plans seemed to advance no further.\r\nMrs Ingleton\'s ill-health was an unlooked-for difficulty.  He even\r\nbegan to suspect that when he did screw himself up to the point of\r\nproposing he should make by no means as easy a conquest of the fair\r\nwidow as he had flattered himself.  She, good lady, liked him as her\r\nboy\'s guardian, but in his own personal capacity was disappointingly\r\nindifferent to his attentions.\r\n\r\nWith all these worries upon him it was little wonder if Mr Ratman\'s\r\nletters hurt his feelings.\r\n\r\nHe was very much inclined to throw up the sponge and vanish from the\r\nMaxfield horizon, and might have attempted the feat had not a letter\r\nwhich arrived on the following day suggested another way out of his\r\ndifficulties.  It came from America, addressed to the late Squire, and\r\nread thus--\r\n\r\n  "Dear Ingleton,--I guess you\'ve forgotten the scape-grace brother-in-\r\n  law who, thirty-six years ago, on the day you married his sister Ruth,\r\n  borrowed a hundred pounds of you without the slightest intention of\r\n  paying you back.  He has not forgotten you.  Your hundred pounds\r\n  started me in life right away here, where I am now a boss and mayor of\r\n  my city.  I\'ve put off being honest as long as I can, but can\'t well\r\n  manage it any longer.  I send you back the money in English bank-\r\n  notes, and another hundred for interest.  It won\'t do you much good,\r\n  but I reckon I\'ll sleep better at night to have got rid of it.  I saw\r\n  in the papers the death of my sister, and her son, my nephew.  Such is\r\n  life!  I got more good from that marriage than she did.  I take for\r\n  granted you are still in the old place, and, like all the Ingletons I\r\n  ever met, alive and kicking.\r\n\r\n  "Yours out of debt,--\r\n\r\n  "Ralph Headland."\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant read and re-read this curious letter, and hummed a tune\r\nto himself.  He gave a professional twitch to each of the hundred-pound\r\nnotes, and held them up one after the other to the light.  Then he\r\nexamined the post-mark on the envelope, and failed to decipher the name\r\nof the town.\r\n\r\n"Very singular," said he to himself, tapping his fingers on the\r\nenvelope.  "Quite like a chapter in a story.  Really it restores one\'s\r\nfaith in one\'s fellow-man to find honesty asserting itself in this way\r\nafter thirty-six years\' suppression.  Our dear one must have forgotten\r\nthis debt years ago; or written it off as a gift.  I\'m sure he would not\r\nhave liked to accept it now.  Very singular indeed!"\r\n\r\nThen he hummed on for five minutes, and tried to recall what he had been\r\nthinking about before the letter came.  He fancied it was about Ratman.\r\nYes, Ratman was a bad man, and must be got rid of, not so much on the\r\ncaptain\'s account as for the sake of the innocent darlings whose\r\nhappiness he threatened.\r\n\r\nAnd as if there were some connection between the two ideas, captain\r\nOliphant abstractedly put the two notes into his own pocket, and\r\nproceeded thoughtfully to tear up the letter and envelope of the\r\nAmerican mayor.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly completed this function when the door opened and Rosalind\r\nsailed in, looking particularly charming after a breezy walk across the\r\npark.\r\n\r\nShe had rarely seen her father in better and more amiable spirits.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my dear child," said he; "it does one good to see you again.  A\r\nweek\'s absence is a long time.  And how are you getting on at the\r\nVicarage?"\r\n\r\n"They are awfully kind to me," said Rosalind, "and I like my little\r\npupils.  I half wish it was harder work.  As it is, I get time for a\r\nlittle art in between lessons.  I\'ve come over to-day to finish my\r\npicture of the old tower for Roger\'s birthday."\r\n\r\n"Ah, to be sure.  The dear boy\'s birthday is getting near.  We shall\r\ndepend on you to help us here on the day, Rosalind.  So they make you\r\nhappy, do they?  I am very glad to hear it.  Have you all you want?"\r\n\r\n"Everything, dear father; and it makes all the difference to me to feel\r\nI am supporting myself."\r\n\r\n"Brave little puss.  See now," added the fond parent, taking out a\r\ncouple of sovereigns from his purse.\r\n\r\n"I want you to take these to get any little trifle which may add to your\r\ncomfort.  I have not been very lavish with pocket-money, but I think\r\njust now you may find this useful.  Take it, my dear child, and bless\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Really, I have all I--"\r\n\r\n"You must not refuse me, daughter; it will please me if you take it."\r\n\r\nSo Rosalind kissed her father gratefully, and said she should be sure to\r\nfind the money useful, if he could really spare it.  And he, good man,\r\nonly wished it were twice as much.\r\n\r\n"I have just had a note," said he, "from Mr Ratman, who announces his\r\nreturn on the 25th.  During the few days he remains, my dear Rosalind, I\r\nthink you should try, even if it cost you an effort, to be friendly.\r\nAfter all, he is an old comrade, and I have reasons for desiring not to\r\noffend him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, why ever do you let him come back after the unkind way he behaved\r\nto Jill?  I\'m sure he is a bad man, father.  Indeed, I wonder at his\r\nthinking of coming at all after what has happened."\r\n\r\n"I dare say his manner may have been rough; but it was meant only in\r\ngood-natured fun.  Let us think no more about that.  I was annoyed at\r\nthe whole affair; but I must ask you, Rosalind, not to give him\r\nunnecessary offence when he comes again."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t pretend to like people I detest," said she; "but if he conducts\r\nhimself like a gentleman, and goes away soon, there needn\'t be any\r\ntrouble about it."  And she went off to rejoice Roger with a visit.\r\n\r\nDuring the week that followed, Captain Oliphant impressed the whole\r\nfamily with his chastened good-humour.\r\n\r\nHe paid a friendly call at the Vicarage, and expressed his obligations\r\nto the vicar and his wife for their consideration, and trusted his\r\ndaughter, who (though he said so who should not), he was sure was a\r\nconscientious girl--would do her work well and requite them for their\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\nHe bought Tom his longed-for football, and ordered from town a handsome\r\ndressing-case for his dear ward.  He delighted Miss Jill by allowing her\r\nto drive him in his rounds among the tenantry, when he had a friendly\r\nword for everybody.\r\n\r\nJill, in charge of the reins, was as happy as a queen, and quite\r\ncaptivated by her father\'s cheerful good-humour.\r\n\r\n"I wonder what makes you so jolly," she said, as they spanked along the\r\ncountry lanes to Yeld, "dear, dear old daddy?  I shall always drive you\r\nnow, for you see I can manage the pony, can\'t I?  Mr Armstrong taught\r\nme.  He says I shall make a first-rate whip.  I\'m sure I was very stupid\r\nwhen I first tried; but he is ever so patient.  He scolds sometimes, but\r\nhe always lets me know when he\'s pleased; so I don\'t mind.  Do you know,\r\nfather, I\'d give my head for Mr Armstrong any day, I like him so?"\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant shrugged his shoulders.  He wasn\'t equal to coping with\r\na case of sheer infatuation.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure," persisted Jill, flicking the pony into a trot, "he\'s fifty\r\nmillion times as nice as that horrible Mr Ratman."\r\n\r\n"Mr Ratman is a friend of mine," said her father, "and I fear he must\r\nthink you a very silly little girl to object to a bit of fun as you\r\ndid."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind what he thinks.  It wasn\'t fun at all.  He hurt me very\r\nmuch.  Ugh!"\r\n\r\n"Well, he was very much annoyed, and so was I, at what happened; and\r\nwhen he comes here again next week--"\r\n\r\n"Is he coming again next week?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"All right.  I shall run away then--or if I can\'t do that, I shall keep\r\na knife in my pocket.  _Please_, father, don\'t let him come!"\r\n\r\nAnd the child nearly cried in her eagerness.\r\n\r\n"Listen to me, Jill," said her father sternly.  "Unless you can behave\r\nyourself sensibly I shall be very angry indeed.  I expect you to be\r\npolite to Mr Ratman while he is here."\r\n\r\n"He\'d better be polite to young ladies," said the irrepressible Jill.\r\n"If he doesn\'t, I know somebody who will make him."\r\n\r\n"Be silent, miss, and bear in mind my wishes."\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Captain Oliphant sent a polite message to his co-trustee\r\nrequesting the favour of an interview.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong found him in an unusually balmy frame of mind, anxious to\r\ngo into the executorship accounts.\r\n\r\nEverything was square and exact.  The rents and other receipts were all\r\nin order, and the amount duly paid into the bank.  The tutor quite\r\nadmired his colleague\'s aptitude for figures, and the lucid manner in\r\nwhich he accounted for every farthing which had passed through his\r\nhands.  He was hardly prepared for such precision, and there and then\r\nmodified the previous bad impression he had formed.\r\n\r\n"It is necessary to be particular in money matters," said the captain,\r\n"especially where the money of others is involved.  Perhaps you will\r\ncheck my figures, sir, and let me know if you agree in the result."\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong spent an afternoon painfully going over the agent\'s and\r\nbanker\'s accounts, and satisfying himself that all was absolutely\r\ncorrect and in order.  He countersigned the balance-sheet, and went out\r\nof his way to thank Captain Oliphant for taking so much of the labour as\r\nto save both him and Mrs Ingleton a great deal of time.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said the captain drily; "a compliment from Signor Francisco\r\nis worth receiving.  But it is uncalled-for.  Good afternoon, sir."\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong flushed, and screwed his glass violently in his eye.\r\n\r\n"A civil, pleasant-spoken gentleman," said he to himself as he returned\r\nto his room.\r\n\r\nA few days later, the day before the birthday, Captain Oliphant received\r\na telegram couched in the following lordly terms--\r\n\r\n  "Arrive 5.30.  Send trap to meet me.--Ratman."\r\n\r\nHe frowned to himself as he read it.  The tone did not betoken peace.\r\nIt rather called to mind a good many unpleasant reflections, the chief\r\nof which was that Mr Ratman would find matters no further advanced as\r\nregarded the widow, the heir, or the tutor.  The only comfort was that\r\nhe could hardly make himself disagreeable about the bill.\r\n\r\nThe coachman was sent down with the dogcart; but if Mr Ratman expected\r\nany further demonstration of welcome, he was disappointed.  Mrs\r\nIngleton was in bed; Jill was dining at the Rectory; Roger and Armstrong\r\nwere taking a long ride; Tom was poaching on the Maxfield preserves.\r\nOnly Captain Oliphant was at home.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'re here to receive me, are you?" snarled the visitor.  "How\r\nlong has it taken you to organise this flattering reception, I should\r\nlike to know?"\r\n\r\n"I really have nothing to do with other persons\' arrangements," said the\r\ncaptain.  "If they happen to be out, it\'s not my concern."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s mine.  You ought to have sent the heir down to meet me--I\'ve\r\nnot seen him yet--and had those girls of yours here to give me afternoon\r\ntea.  Where are they?"\r\n\r\nThe captain attempted to explain.\r\n\r\n"That won\'t do for me," said the visitor, "not by any means.  They\r\nshould have been on the spot.  When did the tutor leave?"\r\n\r\n"He is still here."\r\n\r\n"Still here!" said Ratman, with a curse.  "Didn\'t I tell you he was to\r\nbe packed off before I came?"\r\n\r\n"You said a good many things, Ratman.  I expected he would have gone a\r\nfortnight ago; but he can\'t be moved."\r\n\r\nRatman growled out a string of oaths.\r\n\r\n"Get me some tea," said he, "and tell them to take my traps upstairs.\r\nWhat time do we dine?"\r\n\r\n"I was going to propose that we should dine together in my room at\r\nseven," said the captain.\r\n\r\n"Not good enough.  I\'ll dine with the lot of you at the big table.  And\r\nnow, about my bill."\r\n\r\nNow was the captain\'s turn.\r\n\r\n"What about it?" said he.\r\n\r\n"What about it?  I want the money for it--that\'s what\'s about it."\r\n\r\n"All right, keep your temper.  You shall have the hundred to-morrow when\r\nit\'s due."\r\n\r\nRatman glanced up at his host with a leer.\r\n\r\n"Whose till have you been robbing now?" he said.\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant frowned.\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t a very genial way about you, Ratman.  Try a cigar."\r\n\r\n"Oh, bless you," said he, "I ask no questions.  It\'s all one to me, so\r\nlong as it\'s solid pounds, shillings and pence."\r\n\r\n"You wait till to-morrow, and it will be all right," said the Captain;\r\n"and meanwhile, my dear fellow, try to make yourself agreeable, and\r\ndon\'t spoil sport by being unreasonably exacting.  Ah, here\'s the tea!"\r\n\r\nAt dinner that evening, Mr Ratman found his only companions Captain\r\nOliphant, Roger, and Mr Armstrong.  The talk was difficult, the captain\r\nworking hard to give his guest a friendly lead; Mr Armstrong trying to\r\nappear oblivious of the fact that he had knocked the fellow down twice\r\nfor a cad; and Roger as head of the house, trying to be affable to a\r\nperson whom he had expected to find detestable, and who quite came up to\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\nAs the meal went on Mr Ratman showed alarming symptoms of requiring no\r\nfriendly lead to encourage his powers of conversation.  Despite his\r\nhost\'s deprecatory signals, he began to tell stories of an offensive\r\ncharacter, and joke about matters not generally held to be amusing in a\r\ncompany of gentlemen.  Captain Oliphant grew hot and nervous.  Mr\r\nArmstrong leant back coolly in his chair, and kept his eye curiously on\r\nthe speaker, an apparently interested listener.  Roger, after the first\r\nsurprise, flushed wrathfully and fidgeted ominously with his napkin\r\nring.\r\n\r\nHe was nearly at the end of his tether, and an awkward scene might have\r\nensued, had not Tom opportunely broken in upon the party, very hungry\r\nand flushed with a good afternoon\'s sport.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Ratman!" said he, greeting the visitor; "turned up again?  Got\r\nover your black eye all right?  I\'ve told Armstrong to let me know when\r\nthe next mill comes off, and I\'ll hold the sponge?  Been telling them\r\nsome of your rummy stories?  I roared over that you told me about the--"\r\n\r\n"Be quiet, Tom, and go and wash yourself before dinner," said his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n"All right.  But I say, Ratman, you\'d better steer clear of my young\r\nsister Jill.  She\'s got a downer on you, and so has--"\r\n\r\n"Do you hear, sir?" shouted the father.\r\n\r\nSomehow this genial interruption robbed Mr Ratman of his ideas, and\r\nstopped the flow of his discourse, much to the relief of the remainder\r\nof the party.\r\n\r\n"Well?" said Mr Armstrong, when he and his ward met afterwards in the\r\nroom of the latter, "how do you like our new visitor?"\r\n\r\n"So badly that I am thankful for once that Rosalind has gone."\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong looked hard at his ward for a moment.  Then he twitched\r\nhis glass uncomfortably, and replied in an absent sort of way--\r\n\r\n"Quite so--quite so."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nA VOICE FROM THE DEAD.\r\n\r\nRoger Ingleton\'s reflections, as he lay awake on the morning of his\r\ntwentieth birthday, were not altogether self-congratulatory.  He was\r\npainfully aware that he was what he himself would have styled a poor\r\ncreature.  He was as weak, physically, as a girl; he was not\r\nparticularly clever; he was given to a melancholy which made him pass\r\nfor dull in society.  Ill-health dogged him whenever he tried to achieve\r\nanything out of the commonplace.  His tenantry regarded him still as a\r\nboy, and very few of his few friends set much store by him for his own\r\nsake apart from his fortune.\r\n\r\n"A poor show altogether," said he to himself.  "That boy on the wall\r\nthere would have made a much better thing of it.  There\'s some go in\r\nhim, especially the copy that Rosalind--"\r\n\r\nHere he pulled up.  In addition to his other misfortunes, it occurred to\r\nhim now definitely for the first time that he was in love.\r\n\r\n"She doesn\'t care two straws about me," said he ungratefully; "that is,\r\nexcept in a sisterly way.  Why should she?  I know nothing about art,\r\nwhich she loves.  I\'m saddled with pots of money, which she hates.  The\r\nonly way I can interest her is by being ill.  I\'m not even scape-grace\r\nenough to make it worth her while to take me in hand to reform me.\r\nHeigho!  It\'s a pity that brother of mine had not lived.  Yes, you," he\r\nadded, shaking his head at the portrait, "with your wild harum-scarum\r\nface and mocking laugh.  You\'d have suited her, and been able to make\r\nher like you--I can\'t.  I believe she thinks more of Armstrong than me.\r\nNot much wonder either.  Only, wouldn\'t he be horrified if any one\r\nsuggested such a thing!"\r\n\r\nAnd the somewhat dismal soliloquy ended in a some what dismal laugh, as\r\nthe heir of Maxfield assumed the perpendicular and pulled up his blind.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong, fresh from his dip in the sea, came in before he had\r\nfinished dressing.\r\n\r\n"Well, old fellow," said he, "many happy returns!  How are you--pretty\r\nfit?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not sorry there\'s a year between each," said the boy.\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong?" said the tutor.\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing; only I don\'t feel particularly festive.  I\'ve been lying\r\nawake a long time."\r\n\r\n"Pity you didn\'t get up.  Shocking habit to lie in bed after you\'re\r\nawake."\r\n\r\n"At that rate I should often be up at two in the morning," said Roger.\r\n\r\n"I doubt it--but what\'s wrong?"\r\n\r\nRoger put down his brush, and flung himself on a chair.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know--yes, I do.  Can\'t you guess?"\r\n\r\n"Cheese for supper," suggested the tutor seriously.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be a fool, Armstrong, and don\'t laugh at me; I\'m not in the mood\r\nfor a joke.  You know what it is well enough."\r\n\r\nThe tutor\'s glass dropped from his eye, and he walked over to the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n"Quite so.  I overtook her in the park a quarter of an hour ago, and she\r\nis already in the house, wondering why you are so late down on your\r\nbirthday."\r\n\r\nRoger sprang up and resumed his toilet.\r\n\r\n"Has she really come?  Armstrong, I say, I wish I knew how to make her\r\ncare for me."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not an expert in these matters, but it occurs to me that the sort\r\nof thing you want is not made."\r\n\r\n"You mean that if she doesn\'t care for me for what I am, it\'s no use\r\ntrying to get her to care for me by being what I am not."\r\n\r\n"Roger, you have a brilliant way occasionally of putting things exactly\r\nas they should be put."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not much consolation," pursued the boy.\r\n\r\n"Possibly," said the tutor; "but, as I say, I am not an expert in these\r\ndelicate affairs.  Much as I would like to prescribe, I rather advise\r\nyour taking a second opinion--your mother\'s, say.  I was engaged to\r\nteach you classics and the sciences, but the art of love was not\r\nincluded among the subjects to be treated of."\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong was late for breakfast that morning.  For some reason of\r\nhis own he wasted ten minutes at his piano before he obeyed the summons\r\nof the gong, and the chords he played were mostly minor.  But when he\r\ndid appear his glass was fixed as jauntily as ever, and his pursed lips\r\nlooked impervious to any impression from within or without.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise, he found Miss Jill waiting outside the door.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t mean to go in," said she, "where that horrid man is, till you\r\ncame.  I don\'t mind a bit now.  Come along, dear Mr Armstrong."\r\n\r\nDear Mr Armstrong came along, feeling decidedly compromised, but yet a\r\nlittle grateful to his loyal adherent.\r\n\r\nAs usual he dropped into his seat at the foot of the table after a bow\r\nto Miss Oliphant, and a friendly nod to Tom.\r\n\r\nJill, to her consternation, found a seat carefully reserved for her next\r\nto Mr Ratman.  Her impulse on making the discovery was to run; but a\r\nglance at Mr Armstrong, who sat watching her in a friendly way,\r\nreassured her.  To gain time she went round the table and kissed every\r\none (including the tutor), and especially the hero of the day, whom she\r\nartfully tried to persuade, in honour of the occasion, to make room for\r\nher next to himself.  But when that transparent little artifice failed,\r\nshe bridled up and marched boldly to the inevitable.\r\n\r\n"Well, little puss," said Mr Ratman, "haven\'t you got a kiss for me?"\r\n\r\n"No," she replied.  "Father says I\'m to be civil to you, so I\'ll say\r\ngood-morning; but I don\'t mean it a bit; and I still think you\'re a\r\nhorrid, bad man, though I don\'t say so.  I\'m not a bit afraid of you,\r\neither, because Mr Armstrong is here to punish you if you behave\r\nwickedly."\r\n\r\nTom, as usual, improved matters with a loud laugh.\r\n\r\n"Good old Jilly!" cried he; "let him have it!  Sit on his head!  He\'s\r\ngot no friends!  Never you mind, Ratman--she doesn\'t--"\r\n\r\n"Silence, sir?" thundered his father, "or leave the table instantly."\r\n\r\nTom subsided promptly.\r\n\r\n"And you, Jill," continued her father, "do not speak till you\'re spoken\r\nto."\r\n\r\nJill looked down at Mr Armstrong to see if he counselled further\r\nresistance; but as he was studiously busy with the ham, she capitulated,\r\nand said--\r\n\r\n"Then I hope no one will speak to me, because I don\'t want to talk."\r\n\r\nMr Ratman made an effort to turn the incident off with a laugh, and\r\naddressed his further remarks to his host.  But as that gentleman found\r\nsome difficulty in being cordial, and as the rest of the party continued\r\nto enjoy the meal without paying much attention to him, he was on the\r\nwhole relieved when the performance came to an end.\r\n\r\nOn his way to the captain\'s room, afterwards, he encountered Mr\r\nArmstrong.\r\n\r\nThe two men glared at one another in a hostile manner for a moment, and\r\nthen the tutor observed casually that it was a cold day.\r\n\r\n"It will be hotter before it\'s much older," growled the late owner of a\r\ncertain black eye.\r\n\r\n"I can well believe that," said the tutor drily.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, I shall have something to say to you."\r\n\r\n"Delighted, I\'m sure, at any time that suits you."\r\n\r\n"You and I had better understand one another at once," said Mr Ratman.\r\n\r\n"Why not?  I flatter myself I understand you perfectly already."\r\n\r\n"Do you?  Now, look here, my fine fellow.  It\'s easy for you to give\r\nyourself airs, but I know a good deal more about you than I dare say you\r\nwould care to own yourself.  If you\'ll take my advice, the sooner you\r\nclear out of here the better.  You may think you\'ve a snug berth here,\r\nand flatter yourself you pass for a saint with your pupil and his mamma,\r\nbut, let me tell you, I could open their eyes to a thing or two which\r\nwould alter their opinion, as well as the opinion of certain young lady\r\nfriends who--"\r\n\r\n"Who do not require the assistance of Robert Ratman to keep them out of\r\nbad company," retorted the tutor, hotly for him.\r\n\r\n"No, but they may require the assistance of Robert Ratman to keep them\r\nfrom being ashamed of their own father, Mr Armstrong."\r\n\r\nThe tutor glared through his glass.  He understood this threat.\r\n\r\n"What of that?" said he.\r\n\r\n"Merely," said Mr Ratman, "that it depends pretty much on you whether\r\nthey are to continue to believe themselves the children of an officer\r\nand a gentleman, or of a--a fugitive from justice.  That\'s the position,\r\nMr Tutor.  The responsibility rests with you.  If you choose to go, I\r\nshall not undeceive them; if you don\'t--well, it may suit me to open\r\ntheir eyes; there!"\r\n\r\nThe tutor inspected his man from top to toe in a dangerous way, which\r\nmade the recipient of the stare decidedly uncomfortable.  Then, pulling\r\nhimself together with an effort, Mr Armstrong coolly inquired, "Have\r\nyou anything more to say?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s about enough, isn\'t it?  I give you a week."\r\n\r\n"Thanks, very much," said Mr Armstrong, as he turned on his heel.\r\n\r\nRoger, after a long ramble in the park with his fair tormentor, returned\r\nabout noon, flushed and excited.\r\n\r\n"Armstrong, old man," said he, "what\'s to be done?  She\'s kind to me--\r\nhorribly kind; but whenever I get near the subject she laughs me off it,\r\nand holds me at arm\'s length.  What\'s the use of my name and my money\r\nand my prospects, if they can\'t win her?  If I jest, she\'s serious, and\r\nif I\'m serious, she jests--we can\'t hit it.  What\'s to be done, I say?"\r\n\r\n"Patience," said the tutor; "it took several years to capture Troy."\r\n\r\n"All very well for an old bachelor like you.  I expected you\'d say\r\nsomething like that.  I know I could make her happy if she\'d let me try.\r\nBut she won\'t even let me tell her I love her.  What should you do\r\nyourself?"\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong coloured up at the bare notion of such a dilemma.\r\n\r\n"I think I might come to you and ask your advice," said he.\r\n\r\nRoger laughed rather sadly.\r\n\r\n"I know," said he.  "Of course it\'s a thing one has to play off one\'s\r\nown bat, but I sometimes wish I were anything but the heir of Maxfield.\r\nShe might care for me then."\r\n\r\n"You can disinherit yourself by becoming a criminal, or marrying under\r\nage--"\r\n\r\n"Or dying--thank you," said the boy.  "You are something like a\r\nconsoler.  I know it\'s a shame to bore you about it, but I\'ve no one\r\nelse to talk to."\r\n\r\n"I\'d give my right hand to help you, old fellow," said the tutor; "but,\r\nas you say, I\'m absolutely no use in a case like this."\r\n\r\n"I know.  Come upstairs and play something."\r\n\r\n"By the way," said the tutor, as they reached the study, "I\'ve something\r\nto give you.  You may as well have it now."\r\n\r\nAnd he went to his desk and took out an envelope.\r\n\r\n"It will explain itself," said he, handing it to the boy.\r\n\r\nHe sat down at the piano, and wandered over the keys, while Roger, too\r\nfull of his own cares to give much heed to the missive in his hands,\r\nwalked over to the window and looked out across the park.  The afternoon\r\nsun was glancing across the woods, and gleaming far away on the sea.\r\n"If only she would share it with me," thought he to himself, "how proud\r\nI should be of the dear old place.  But what good is it all to me if she\r\ncondemns me to possess it all myself?"\r\n\r\nThen with a sigh he turned his back on the scene, and let his eyes fall\r\non the letter.\r\n\r\nHe started as he recognised the dead hand of his father in the\r\ninscription--\r\n\r\n"_To be given unopened into the hands of Roger Ingleton junior, on his\r\ntwentieth birthday_."\r\n\r\nHis breath came fast as he broke the seal and looked within.  The\r\nenvelope contained two enclosures, a document and a letter.  The latter,\r\nwhich he examined first, was dated scarcely a fortnight before the old\r\nman\'s death, written in the same trembling hand as the words on the\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\n"My dear son," it said, "this will reach you long after the hand that\r\nwrites it is still and cold.  My days are numbered, and for better or\r\nworse are rapidly flying to their account.  But before I go, I have\r\nsomething to say to you.  Read this, and the paper I enclose herewith.\r\nIf, after reading them, you choose to destroy them, no one will blame\r\nyou; no one will know--you will do no one an injury.  You are free to\r\nact as you choose.  What follows is not a request from me, still less a\r\ncommand.  It is a confidence--no more."\r\n\r\nRoger put down the letter.  His head was in a whirl.  He only half heard\r\nthe notes of the tutor\'s sonata as they rose and fell on his ear.\r\nPresently, with beating heart, he read on--\r\n\r\n"You had a brother once--a namesake--whom you never saw, and perhaps\r\nnever heard of.  You never mourned his loss, for he was gone before you\r\nwere born.  Twenty-two years ago he was a boy of 16--a fine, high-\r\nspirited Ingleton.  Like a fool, I thought I could bring him up to be a\r\nfine man.  But I failed--I only spoiled him.  He grew up wild, self-\r\nwilled, obstinate--a sorrow to his mother, an enemy to his father.  The\r\nday came when we quarrelled.  I accused him unjustly of fraud.  He\r\nretorted insolently.  In my passion I struck him, and he struck back.  I\r\nfought my own boy and beat him; but my victory was the evil crisis of my\r\nlife, for he left home vowing he would die sooner than return.  His\r\nmother died of a broken heart.  I had to live with mine; too proud to\r\nrepent or admit my fault.  Then came a rumour that the boy was dead.  I\r\nnever believed it; yet wrote him off as dead.  Now, as I near my end, I\r\nstill discredit the story; I am convinced he still lives.  In that\r\nconviction, I have made a new will, which is the paper enclosed.  As you\r\nwill see, it provides that if he should return before you attain your\r\nmajority, he becomes sole heir to the property; if not found before that\r\ntime, the will under which you inherit all remains valid.  You are at\r\nliberty to keep or destroy this new will as you choose.  Nor, if you\r\nkeep it, are you bound to do anything towards finding your lost brother.\r\nBut should you desire to make inquiries, I am able to give you this\r\nfeeble clue--that, after leaving home, he went to the bad in London in\r\ncompany with a companion named Fastnet, but where they lived I know not.\r\nAlso, that the rumour of his death came to me from India.  I can say no\r\nmore, only that I am his and your loving father,--\r\n\r\n"Roger Ingleton."\r\n\r\nTowards the end the writing became very weak and straggling, and what to\r\nthe boy was the most important passage was well-nigh illegible.  When,\r\nafter reading it a second time, he looked up, it was hard to believe he\r\nwas the same Roger Ingleton who, a few minutes since, had broken the\r\nseal of that mysterious letter.  The tutor, lost in his music, played\r\non; the sun still flashed on the distant sea, the park still stretched\r\naway below him--but all seemed part of another world to the heir of\r\nMaxfield.\r\n\r\nHis brother--that wild-eyed, fascinating, defiant boy in the picture--\r\nlived still, and all this place was his.  Till that moment Roger had\r\nnever imagined what it would be to be anything but the heir of Maxfield.\r\n\r\nEvery dream of his for the future had Maxfield painted into the\r\nbackground.  He loved the place as his own, as his sphere in life, as\r\nhis destiny.  Was that a dream after all?  Were all his castles in the\r\nair to vanish, and leave him a mere dependant in a house not his own?\r\n\r\nHe took up the document and read it over.  It was brief and abrupt.\r\nReferring to the former will, it enjoined that all its provisions should\r\nremain strictly in force as if no codicil or later will had been\r\nexecuted until the 26th of October, 1886, on which day Roger Ingleton\r\nthe younger should attain his majority.  But if on or before that day\r\nthe elder son, whom the testator still believed to be living, should be\r\nfound and identified, the former will on that day was to become null and\r\nvoid, and the elder son was to become sole possessor of the entire\r\nproperty.  If, on the contrary, he should not be found or have proved\r\nhis identity by that day, then the former will was to hold good\r\nabsolutely, and the codicil became null and void.\r\n\r\nSuch, shorn of its legal verbiage, was the document which Roger, by the\r\nsame hand that executed it, was invited, if he wished, to destroy.\r\nPerhaps for a moment, as his eyes glanced once more across the park, and\r\na vision of Rosalind flitted across his mind, he was tempted to avail\r\nhimself of his liberty.  But if the idea endured a moment it had\r\nvanished a moment after.\r\n\r\nHe went up to the piano, where Mr Armstrong, still in the clouds, was\r\nroaming at will over the chords, and laid his father\'s letter on the\r\nkeyboard.\r\n\r\n"Read that, please, Armstrong."\r\n\r\nThe tutor wheeled round on his stool, and put up his glass.  Something\r\nin the boy\'s voice arrested him.\r\n\r\nHe glanced first at his pupil, then at the paper.\r\n\r\n"A private letter?" said he.\r\n\r\n"I want your help; please read it."\r\n\r\nThe tutor\'s inscrutable face, as he perused the letter carefully from\r\nbeginning to end, afforded very little direction to the boy who sat and\r\nwatched him anxiously.  Having read it once, Mr Armstrong turned back\r\nto the first page and read it again; and then with equal care perused\r\nthe codicil.  When all was done, he returned them slowly to the envelope\r\nand handed it back.\r\n\r\n"Well?" said Roger, rather impatiently.\r\n\r\n"It is a strange birthday greeting," said Mr Armstrong, "and comes, I\r\nfear, from a mind unhinged.  Your father had more than one delusion near\r\nthe end.  But on the night before he died he told me this elder son of\r\nhis was dead.  This was written before that."\r\n\r\n"Tell me exactly what he said."\r\n\r\nThe tutor repeated as nearly as he could the conversation of that\r\nmemorable night.\r\n\r\n"Is it not more probable that a fortnight earlier his mind might be\r\nclearer than at the very moment of his death?"\r\n\r\n"It is possible, of course; but the letter does not seem to show it.\r\nBesides, the inscription at the back of the portrait (which you have\r\nforgotten) is a distinct record of the boy\'s death.  I wish you had not\r\nshown me the letter, because the only advice I have to give you is that\r\nyou do with it what he invites you to do."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Armstrong!" said Roger, getting up and walking restlessly up\r\nand down the room; "you mean kindly, I know--you always do--but you\r\ndon\'t seem to realise that you are tempting me to be a cad and a\r\ncoward!"\r\n\r\nThe tutor looked up, and his eyebrow twitched uncomfortably.  Roger had\r\nnever spoken like this before, and the heat of the words took even him\r\naback.\r\n\r\n"You asked my advice, unfortunately, and I gave it," said he, rather\r\ndrily.\r\n\r\n"Do you think I should have an hour\'s peace if I didn\'t do everything in\r\nmy power to find my brother now?" retorted the boy.  "You\'re not obliged\r\nto help me, I know."\r\n\r\n"I am--I am bound to help you; not because I am your tutor or your\r\nguardian, but because I love you."\r\n\r\n"Then help me in this.  My father, I feel sure, was right.  Whether he\r\nwas or not, and whether I have to do it single-handed or not, I mean to\r\nfind my brother."\r\n\r\n"Certainly you may count on me, old fellow," said the tutor; "but be\r\nquite sure first that you know what you are undertaking.  If it is not a\r\nwild-goose chase it is something uncommonly like it.  You resolve to\r\nwaste a whole year.  You are not strong, your future is all in Maxfield;\r\nthe happiness of your mother, your hopes of winning the object of your\r\naffections, are involved in the step you take.  Even if this brother of\r\nyours be living (of which the chances seem to be a hundred to one he is\r\nnot), he is, as your father says, a man who has gone to the bad; not the\r\nboy of the picture, but a man twice your age, of the Ratman order, let\r\nus say, probably the worst possible companion for yourself, and a bad\r\nfriend to the people who already count you as their master.  Had he been\r\nliving with any desire or intention of claiming his title, he would\r\ncertainly have come forward months ago--"\r\n\r\n"I know all that, Armstrong," said the boy; "I know perfectly well you\r\nare bringing up all these points as a friend, to prevent my taking a\r\nrash step of which I shall afterwards be sorry.  I don\'t care how bad he\r\nis, or what it costs, I mean to find him; and if you help me, I\'m\r\nconfident I shall.  Only," said he regretfully, "I certainly wish it was\r\nthe boy in the picture, and not a middle-aged person, who is to be\r\nlooked for."\r\n\r\nHere Tom broke in upon the conference.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Roger, here you are!  What are you up to?  You and Armstrong\r\nlook as blue as if you\'d swallowed live eels.  I say, you\'re a nice\r\nchap.  Rosalind has been waiting half an hour, she says, for that ride\r\nyou were to go with her, and if you don\'t look sharp she\'ll give Ratman\r\nthe mount and jockey you, my boy.  Poor old Ratty! didn\'t Jill drop on\r\nhim like a sack of coals at breakfast?  Jolly rough on the governor\r\nhaving to stroke him down after it.  I say, mind you\'re in in time to\r\nreceive the deputation.  They\'re all going to turn up, and old Hodder\'s\r\nto make a speech.  I wouldn\'t miss it for a half sov!  All I know is I\'m\r\njolly glad I\'m not an heir.  It\'s far jollier to be an ordinary chap;\r\nisn\'t it, Mr Armstrong?"\r\n\r\n"Decidedly," said the tutor demurely; "but we can\'t all be what we\r\nlike."\r\n\r\n"Tell Rosalind I\'ll be down in a second; I\'m awfully sorry to have kept\r\nher," said Roger.\r\n\r\n"By the way," said the tutor, when Tom had gone; "about this letter.\r\nThe communication is evidently made to you by your father as a secret.\r\nI am sorry, on that account, you showed it to me, because I object to\r\nsecrets not meant for me.  But if you take my advice you will not let it\r\ngo further.  It would be clearly contrary to the wishes of your father."\r\n\r\n"I see that.  Lock the will up in your desk again; I\'ll take care of the\r\nletter.  Nobody but you and I shall know of their existence.  And now I\r\nmust go to Rosalind."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nWHAT A HORSEWHIP DISCOVERED.\r\n\r\nMr Ratman\'s business interview with his friend was short and stormy.\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Oliphant produced the hundred-pound note, and requested his\r\ncreditor to accept a fresh bill for the balance, that injured gentleman\r\nbroke out into very emphatic abuse.\r\n\r\n"Likely, is it not?" laughed he.  "You, a common thief, bring me, who\'ve\r\nsaved you from a convict\'s cell, here to be insulted and made a fool of\r\nby your miserable brats and servants, and then have the calmness to ask\r\nme to lend you a hundred pounds?  I admire your impudence, sir, and\r\nthat\'s all I admire about you."\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, how can you blame me--"\r\n\r\n"Blame you!  You don\'t suppose I\'m going to take the trouble to do that!\r\nCome, hand over the other hundred, sharp.  I\'ve nothing to say to you\r\ntill that\'s done."\r\n\r\nAnd Mr Ratman, digging his hands in his pockets, got up and walked to\r\nthe fireplace.\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant\'s face fell.  He knew his man by this time, and had\r\nsense enough at least to know that this was no time for argument.  Yet\r\nhe could not help snarling--\r\n\r\n"I can only do part."\r\n\r\n"The whole--in five minutes--or there\'ll be interest to add!" retorted\r\nMr Ratman.\r\n\r\nWith a groan Captain Oliphant flung down the second bank-note on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n"Take it, you coward! and may it help you to perdition!"\r\n\r\n"Thanks, very much," said Ratman, carefully putting away the money.\r\n"I\'m not going to ask you where the money came from.  That would be\r\npainful.  Ah, Teddy, my boy, what a nice, respectable family man you\r\nare, to be sure!"\r\n\r\nWith which acknowledgment Mr Ratman, in capital spirits, returned to\r\nhis room.  On the way he encountered Tom, who, being of a forgiving\r\ndisposition, owed him no grudge for the trouble that had occurred at\r\nbreakfast-time.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Mr Ratty!" said the boy; "going out?  Aren\'t you looking\r\nforward to the party to-night?  I am.  Only I\'m afraid they\'ll make a\r\nmess of it among them.  Auntie\'s ill and in bed, Rosalind and Roger are\r\nspooning about in the grounds, Armstrong\'s got the dismals, and the\r\ngovernor\'s not to be disturbed.  I\'ve got to look after everything.  The\r\nspread will be good enough--only I think they ought to have roasted an\r\nox whole in the hall; don\'t you?  That\'s the proper way to do things,\r\ninstead of kickshaws and things with French names that one can swallow\r\nat a gulp.  I say, there\'s to be a dance first.  I\'ll introduce you to\r\nsome of the old girls if you like.  It won\'t be much fun for me, for\r\nJill has made me promise to dance every dance with her, for fear you\r\nshould want one.  But I know a chap or two that will take her off my\r\nhands.  I say, would you like to see my den?" added he, as they passed\r\nthe door in question.\r\n\r\nMr Ratman being of an inquiring turn of mind, accepted the invitation,\r\nand gave a cursory glance at the chaos which formed the leading feature\r\nof the apartment.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not such a swagger crib as Roger\'s," said Tom; "but it\'s snug\r\nenough.  That\'s Roger\'s opposite.  Like to look?"\r\n\r\nOnce more Mr Ratman allowed himself to be escorted on a tour of\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\n"Who is that a portrait of?" asked he, looking at the lost Roger\'s\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s what\'s his name, the fellow who would have been heir if he\r\nhadn\'t died.  He looks rather a tough customer, doesn\'t he?  That\'s the\r\npicture Rosalind painted for Roger\'s birthday--a view of the park from\r\nher window, with the sea beyond.  Not so bad, is it?  Rosalind thinks\r\nshe\'s no end of an artist, but I--"\r\n\r\n"When did he die?" inquired Mr Ratman, still examining the picture.\r\n\r\n"Oh, ever so long ago--before the old Squire married Auntie.  I say,\r\ncome and have a punt about with my new football, will you?"\r\n\r\n"Go and get it.  I\'ll be down presently.  I like pictures, and shall\r\njust take a look at these first!"\r\n\r\nTom bustled off, wondering what Mr Ratman could see in the pictures to\r\nallure him from the joys of football.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, Mr Ratman was not a great artist.  But the portrait\r\nof the lost Roger appeared to interest him, as did also the sight of an\r\nopen letter, hastily laid down by the owner on the writing-table.\r\n\r\nSomething in the handwriting of the letter particularly aroused the\r\ncuriosity of the trespasser, who, being, as has been said, of an\r\ninquiring disposition, ventured to look at it more closely.\r\n\r\n"_To be given unopened into the hands of Roger Ingleton, junior, on his\r\ntwentieth birthday_."\r\n\r\nThe coast was conveniently clear for Mr Ratman, as, fired with a zeal\r\nfor information, he slipped the letter from the envelope and, with half\r\nan eye on the door, hastily read it.  As he did so, he flushed a little,\r\nand having read the letter once, read it again.  Then he quickly\r\nreplaced it in its cover, and laying it where he had discovered it, beat\r\na rapid retreat.\r\n\r\nHe played football badly that afternoon, so that his young companion\'s\r\nopinion of him lowered considerably.  Nor was either sorry when the\r\nceremony was over, and the bell warned them to return to their quarters\r\nand prepare for the evening\'s festivities.\r\n\r\nMr Ratman dressed with special care, spending some time before the\r\nmirror in an endeavour to set off his person to the best advantage.  As\r\nthe reader has already been told, Mr Ratman retained some of the traces\r\nof a handsome youth.  The fires of honour and sobriety were\r\nextinguished, but his well-shaped head and clear-cut features still\r\nweathered the storm, and suggested that if their owner was not good-\r\nlooking now, he might once have been.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was a lingering impression of the lost Roger\'s portrait which\r\nmade this vain gentleman adjust his curly locks and pose his head before\r\nthe glass in a style not unlike his model.  Whether that was so or not,\r\nthe result appeared to satisfy him, and in due time, and not till after\r\nseveral of the guests had already arrived, he descended in state to the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\nIt was the first festive gathering at Maxfield since the death of the\r\nlate Squire, and a good deal of curiosity was manifest on the part of\r\nsome of the guests both as to the heir and his new guardian.\r\n\r\nRoger, nerved up to the occasion by his own spirit and the encouragement\r\nof his tutor, bore his inspection well, and won golden opinions from his\r\nfuture comrades and neighbours.\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant also acquitted himself well; and anything lacking in\r\nhim was amply forgiven for the sake of his charming daughters, the elder\r\nof whom fairly took the "county" by storm.\r\n\r\nQuite unconscious of the broken hearts which strewed her way, Rosalind,\r\nwith the duties of hostess unexpectedly cast upon her by Mrs Ingleton\'s\r\nillness, exerted herself for the general happiness, and enjoyed herself\r\nin the task.\r\n\r\nDespite Tom\'s forebodings, the evening went off brilliantly.  The music\r\nwas excellent, the amateur theatricals highly appreciated, and the dance\r\nall that could be desired.  The loyal youth found no difficulty in\r\npalming his young sister off on half a dozen partners delighted to have\r\nthe opportunity, and his head was fairly turned by the sudden popularity\r\nin which he found himself with visitors anxious for an introduction to\r\nthe fair Rosalind.\r\n\r\n"Oh, all serene," said he confidentially to one of those glowing youths.\r\n"She\'s booked six or seven deep, but I\'ll work it for you if I can.\r\nYou hang about here, and I\'ll fetch her up."\r\n\r\nBut the luckless ones hung about in vain.  For Tom\'s progress was\r\nintercepted by other candidates for the same favour, amidst whom the\r\nyoung diplomatist played fast and loose in a reprehensible manner.\r\n\r\n"Promised _you_, did I?" demanded he of one.  "Well, you\'ll have to\r\nsquare it up with that sandy-haired chap at the door.  He says I\r\npromised _him_; but he\'s all wrong, for the one I _did_ promise is that\r\nlittle dapper chap there in the window.  He\'s been waiting on and off\r\nsince eight o\'clock.  Never you mind; you hang about here, and I\'ll work\r\nit if I-- Hullo! here\'s another one!  I didn\'t promise you, did I?  All\r\nright, old chappie.  You lean up there against the wall, and I\'ll\r\nengineer it for you somehow.  She\'s owing me a dance about eight down\r\nthe list.  You can have a quarter of it, if you like, and the other two\r\nchaps can go halves in the rest."\r\n\r\nWith which the unprincipled youth absconded into the supper-room.\r\n\r\n"And who is that talking to your charming cousin?" asked a dowager who\r\nhad succeeded in capturing Roger for five minutes in a corner.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s my tutor, Armstrong--the best fellow in the world."\r\n\r\n"Evidently a great admirer of Miss Oliphant.  No doubt the attraction is\r\nmutual?"\r\n\r\nRoger laughed, and speculated on Armstrong\'s horror were he to hear of\r\nsuch a suggestion.\r\n\r\n"And that gentleman talking to Captain Oliphant?  What relation is he?"\r\n\r\n"He?  None at all.  He\'s a Mr Ratman, an Indian friend of my\r\nguardian\'s."\r\n\r\n"Dear me!  I quite thought he was an Ingleton by his face--but I\'m glad\r\nhe is not; I dislike his appearance.  Besides, he has already had more\r\nthan is good for him."\r\n\r\n"He\'s no great favourite," said Roger shortly.\r\n\r\nPresently Captain Oliphant and his companion stepped up to where\r\nRosalind and her partner stood.\r\n\r\n"Mr Armstrong," said the former, "will you kindly see that the band\r\ngets supper after the next dance?"\r\n\r\nThe words were spoken politely, and Mr Armstrong, although he knew that\r\nthe speaker\'s solicitude on behalf of the band was by no means as great\r\nas his desire to see the tutor\'s back, felt he could hardly refuse.\r\n\r\n"Rosalind," said the Captain, looking significantly at his daughter,\r\n"Mr Ratman desires the pleasure of a dance, and will take you into the\r\nnext room."\r\n\r\nRosalind tossed her head and flushed.\r\n\r\n"Thank you; I am tired," said she.  "I prefer not to dance at present."\r\n\r\n"You are keeping Mr Ratman waiting, my dear."\r\n\r\nThe colour died out of the girl\'s face as, with a little shiver, she\r\nlaid the tips of her fingers on her partner\'s arm.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," said that genial individual.  "Do as you are told.  You\r\ndon\'t fancy it; but pa\'s word is law, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nShe said nothing, but the colour shot back ominously into her cheeks.\r\n\r\n"And so you\'ve run off and left us," pursued her partner, who rather\r\nenjoyed the situation, and was vain enough to appreciate the distinction\r\nof dancing with the belle of the evening.  "So sorry.  I quite envy the\r\nlittle vicar boys and girls--upon my honour I do.  Very unkind of you to\r\ngo just as I came.  Never mind.  Not far away, is it?  We shall see lots\r\nof one another."\r\n\r\nAt this moment, just as the band was striking up for a quadrille, Jill\r\ncame up.\r\n\r\n"Have you seen dear Mr Arm-- O Rosalind! how _can_ you dance with that\r\nman?"\r\n\r\nMr Ratman laughed.\r\n\r\n"Very well, missy.  I\'ll pay you out.  You shall dance with me, see if\r\nyou don\'t, before the evening is out."\r\n\r\nBefore which awful threat Jill fled headlong to seek the tutor.\r\n\r\n"Fact is," pursued Mr Ratman, reverting to his previous topic, "ever\r\nsince I saw you, Miss Rosalind, I said to myself--Robert Ratman, you\r\nhave found the right article at last.  You don\'t suppose I\'d come all\r\nthe way here from India, do you, if there weren\'t attractions?"\r\n\r\nShe kept a rigid silence, and went through the steps of the quadrille\r\nwithout so much as a look at the talker, Ratman was sober enough to be\r\nannoyed at this chilly disdain.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know it\'s rude not to speak when you\'re spoken to, Miss\r\nRosalind?" said he.  "If you choose to be friends with me we shall get\r\non very well, but you mustn\'t be rude."\r\n\r\nShe turned her head away.\r\n\r\n"You aren\'t deaf, are you?" said he, becoming still more nettled.  "I\r\nsuppose if it was the heir of Maxfield that was talking to you you\'d\r\nhear, wouldn\'t you?  You\'d be all smiles and nods to the owner of ten\r\nthousand a year, eh?  Do you suppose we can\'t see through your little\r\ngame, you artful little schemer?  Now, will you speak or not?"\r\n\r\nHer cheeks gave the only indication that she had heard this last\r\npolished speech as she gathered up her dress and swept out of the\r\nquadrille.\r\n\r\n"Wait," said he, losing his temper, "the dance is not over."\r\n\r\nShe stepped quickly to a chair, and sat there at bay.\r\n\r\n"Come back," said he, following her, "or I will make you.  I won\'t be\r\ninsulted like this before the whole room.  Come back; do you hear?"\r\n\r\nAnd he snatched her hand.\r\n\r\nRosalind looked up, and as she did so she caught a distant vision of an\r\neye-glass dropping from a gentleman\'s eye to the length of its cord.  A\r\nmoment after, Mr Ratman felt a hand close like a vice on his collar and\r\nhimself almost lifted from the room.  It was all done so quickly that\r\nthe quadrille party were only just becoming aware that a couple had\r\ndropped out; and the non-dancers were beginning to wonder if Miss\r\nOliphant had been taken poorly, when Robert Ratman was writhing in the\r\nclutches of his chastiser in the hall.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong marched straight with his prey to the kitchen.\r\n\r\n"Raffles," said he to the footman, "get me a horsewhip."\r\n\r\nRaffles took in the situation at once, and in half a minute was across\r\nat the stable.\r\n\r\nAs he returned with the whip he met Mr Armstrong in the yard, holding\r\nhis victim much as a cat would hold a rat, utterly indifferent to his\r\noaths, his kicks, or his threats.\r\n\r\n"Thanks," said the tutor, as he took the whip; "go in and shut the door.\r\nNow, sir, for you!"\r\n\r\n"Touch me if you dare!" growled Ratman; "it will be the worse for you\r\nand every one.  Do you know who I am!  I\'m--I\'m,"--here he pulled\r\nhimself up and glared his enemy in the face--"_I\'m Roger Ingleton_!"\r\n\r\nIt spoke worlds for the tutor\'s self-possession that in the start\r\nproduced by this announcement he did not let his victim escape.  It\r\nspoke still more for his resolution that, having heard it, he continued\r\nhis horsewhipping to the bitter end before he replied--\r\n\r\n"Whoever you are, sir, that will teach you how to behave to a lady."\r\n\r\n"You fool!" hissed Ratman, with an oath, getting up from the ground;\r\n"you\'ll be sorry for this.  I\'ll be even with you.  I\'ll ruin you.  I\'ll\r\nturn your precious ward out of the place.  I\'ll teach that girl--"\r\n\r\nAn ominous crack of the tutor\'s whip cut short the end of the sentence,\r\nand Mr Ratman left the remainder of his threats to the imagination of\r\nhis audience.\r\n\r\nWhen, ten minutes later, the tutor, with eye-glass erect, strolled back\r\ninto the drawing-room, no one would have supposed that he had been\r\nhorsewhipping an enemy or making a discovery on which the fate of a\r\nwhole household depended.  His thin, compressed lips wore their usual\r\nenigmatic lines; his brow was as unruffled as his shirt front.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mr Armstrong, where have you been?" cried Jill, pouncing on him\r\nat the door; "I\'ve been hunting for you everywhere.  You promised me,\r\nyou know."  And the little lady towed off her captive in triumph.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the evening passed uneventfully until at eleven o\'clock\r\nthe festivities in the drawing-room gave place to the more serious\r\nbusiness of the "county" supper, at which, in a specially-erected tent,\r\nabout one hundred guests sat down.\r\n\r\nTom had taken care to procure an early and advantageous seat for the\r\noccasion, and, with one of the vicar\'s daughters under his patronage and\r\ncontrol, prepared to enjoy himself at last.  He had had a bad time of it\r\nso far, for he was in the black-books of almost every youth in the room,\r\nand had been posted as a defaulter in whatever corner he had tried to\r\nhide from his creditors.\r\n\r\n"It\'s awful having a pretty sister," said he confidentially to his\r\ncompanion; "gets a fellow into no end of a mess.  I wish I was your\r\nbrother instead."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said the young lady, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I didn\'t mean that," said Tom.  "You\'re good enough looking, I\r\nthink.  But I don\'t see why Rosalind can\'t pick her own partners,\r\ninstead of me having to manage it for her.  Look out! if that chap\r\nopposite sees me he\'ll kick--put the ferns between.  There she is next\r\nto Roger.  Like her cheek, bagging the best place.  Do you see that kid\r\nthere grinning at the fellow with the eye-glass?  That\'s my young\r\nsister--ought to be in bed instead of fooling about here.  Ah, I knew\r\nit! she\'s planted herself opposite the grapes.  If we don\'t look out we\r\nshan\'t get one.  That\'s my governor coming in; looks rather chippy,\r\ndon\'t he?  I say, lean forward, or he\'ll see me.  He\'s caught me in the\r\nsupper-room five or six times already this evening.  By the way, where\'s\r\nold Ratty?  Do you know Ratty, Miss Isabel?  No end of a scorch.  Just\r\nthe chap for you.  I\'ll introduce you.  Hullo! where is he?" added he,\r\nlooking up and down the table cautiously.  "Surely he\'s not going to\r\nshirk the feed?  Never mind, Miss Isabel; I\'ll work it round for you if\r\nI can."\r\n\r\nMiss Isabel expressed her gratitude with a smile, and asked Tom how he\r\nliked living at Maxfield.\r\n\r\n"Oh, all right, now I\'ve got a football and can go shooting in the\r\nwoods.  I have to pay up for it though with lessons, and--(thanks; all\r\nright; just a little more.  Won\'t you have some yourself while it\'s\r\nhere?)--Armstrong makes us stick at it.  I say, by the way, do you\r\nremember that fellow who died?  (Don\'t take any of that; it\'s no good.\r\nWire in to a wing of the partridge instead.)  Eh, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Whom?  What are you talking about?" asked she, bewildered.\r\n\r\n"Ah, it doesn\'t matter.  He died twenty-one years ago, before Roger was\r\nborn.  I thought you might have known him."\r\n\r\n"Really, Tom, you are not complimentary.  You can\'t expect me to\r\nremember before I was born."\r\n\r\n"What! aren\'t you twenty-one?" asked Tom, staring round at her.  "Go on;\r\nyou\'re joking!  No?  Why, you look twice the age!  This chap, you know,\r\nwould have been the heir if he\'d lived.  There\'s a picture of him\r\nupstairs."\r\n\r\n"And he died, did he?"\r\n\r\n"Rather; but old Hodder--know old Hodder?"\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said his companion; "the speeches are beginning."\r\n\r\n"What a hung nuisance!" said Tom.\r\n\r\nThe oratorical interruption was a brief one.  The Duke of Somewhere, as\r\nthe big man of the county, rose to propose the health of the heir of\r\nMaxfield.  They were glad to make their young neighbour\'s acquaintance,\r\nand looked forward that day year to welcoming him to his own.  They\r\nhoped he\'d be a credit to his name, and keep up the traditions of\r\nMaxfield.  He understood Mr Ingleton was pretty strictly tied up in the\r\nmatter of guardians--(laughter)--but from what he could see, he might be\r\nworse off in that respect; and the county would owe their thanks to\r\nthose gentlemen if they turned out among them the right sort of man to\r\nbe Squire of Maxfield.  He wished his young friend joy and long life and\r\nmany happy returns of the day.\r\n\r\nRoger, rather pale and nervous, replied very briefly.\r\n\r\nHe thanked them for their good wishes, and said he hoped he might take\r\nthese as given not to the heir of Maxfield but to plain Roger Ingleton.\r\nHe was still an infant--("Hear, hear!" from Tom)--and was in no hurry to\r\nget out of the charge of his guardians.  Whatever his other expectations\r\nmight be, he felt that his best heritage was the name he bore; and he\r\nhoped, as his noble neighbour had said, he should turn out worthy of\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nAs he sat down, flushed with his effort, and wondering what two persons\r\nthere would think of his feeble performance, his eye fell on the form of\r\nDr Brandram, who at that moment hurriedly entered the room.\r\n\r\nHe saw him whisper something to Armstrong, who changed colour and rose\r\nfrom his seat.  An intuition, quicker than a flash of lightning,\r\nrevealed to the boy that something was wrong--something in which he was\r\nconcerned.  In a moment he stood with his two friends in the hall.\r\n\r\n"Roger, my brave fellow, your mother has been taken seriously worse\r\nwithin the last hour.  Come and see her."\r\n\r\nThe boy staggered away dazed.  He was conscious of the hum of voices,\r\nwith Tom\'s laugh above all, in the room behind; of the long curve of\r\ncarriage lights waiting in the garden without; of the trophy of flowers\r\nand pampas on either side of the staircase.  Then, as the doctor stepped\r\nforward and softly opened a door, he followed like one in a dream.\r\n\r\nFor an hour the dull roll of carriages came and went on the drive, and\r\nthe cheery babel of departing voices broke the still morning air.\r\n\r\nBut two guests left Maxfield that night unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nOne was the soul of a good lady; the other was the horsewhipped body of\r\na bad man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nSTRONG HEARTS AND WEAK TEMPERS.\r\n\r\nIn the sad confusion which followed upon Mrs Ingleton\'s sudden death,\r\nno one appeared to remark the abrupt departure of Mr Robert Ratman.\r\nRoger certainly never bestowed a thought on the occurrence, and if any\r\nof the other members of the household thought twice about it, they all--\r\neven Jill--kept their ideas on the subject to themselves.\r\n\r\nTo Roger the week that followed his twentieth birthday was the most\r\ndismal of his life.  When a similar blow had fallen months ago he had\r\nbeen too bewildered and benumbed to realise fully his own loss.  Now he\r\nrealised everything only too vividly.\r\n\r\nHis own trouble; the loss of the last near relative he had in the world;\r\nhis own sickly health, chaining him down when he would fain seek comfort\r\nin action; the uncertainty of his position as heir of Maxfield; the\r\nhopeless task before him of finding his lost brother; Rosalind\'s\r\nindifference to his affection--all seemed now to pile up in one great\r\nmountain to oppress him, and he half envied the gentle dead her quiet\r\nresting-place.\r\n\r\nIt was in the second week after the funeral, when Maxfield once more\r\nbegan to assume its normal aspect, and Captain Oliphant was allowing\r\nhimself to hope that, notwithstanding the removal of his latest "dear\r\ndeparted," things were likely to shape themselves a trifle more\r\ncomfortably for his own designs in her absence--it was in the middle of\r\nNovember that a letter was handed to Roger as he dressed one morning in\r\nhis room.\r\n\r\nIt bore the London post-mark, and looked mysterious enough to induce\r\nRoger to lay down his brushes and open it there and then.  This is what\r\nit said:--\r\n\r\n  "Dear Roger,--You\'ll have been expecting to hear from me, as no doubt\r\n  your moral friend, Mr Armstrong, has told you who I am.  I don\'t\r\n  fancy you are specially pleased with the discovery, and it may suit\r\n  you to turn up your nose at your affectionate brother.  You may turn\r\n  up what you like, but it doesn\'t alter the fact.  I am your brother.\r\n  When I heard of my father\'s death I was in India, and made up my mind\r\n  to come home on the chance the old boy had forgiven me and left me\r\n  some of the needful in his will.  Your guardian, Oliphant, had little\r\n  idea that the Indian chum who made such a long journey to pay him a\r\n  visit at Maxfield was really the man to whom the place ought to have\r\n  belonged if every one had his rights.  Of course I soon found out my\r\n  mistake.  The old man kept up his grudge to the end, and cut me out of\r\n  his will without even a shilling.  So you\'ve nothing to be afraid of.\r\n  I dare say when you come into the property you will do something for\r\n  your big brother.  Meanwhile I don\'t expect much out of the pair of\r\n  hypocrites my father chose to leave as your guardians.  But as I am\r\n  hard up, and you can probably do what you like with your pocket-money,\r\n  let me have a L10 note once and again, say fortnightly, addressed to\r\n  Robert Ratman, to be called for at the General Post Office.  If I\r\n  don\'t get this, I shall conclude the Ingletons are true to their\r\n  reputation of being a good deal fonder of their money than their flesh\r\n  and blood.\r\n\r\n  "I don\'t know whether I shall turn up again or not.  It will depend\r\n  pretty much on what I hear.  No doubt you\'ve set me down as a cad and\r\n  a blackleg.  Perhaps I am.  I\'ve not had the advantages you have.\r\n  But, cad or no cad, I\'ve a right to sign myself your brother,--\r\n\r\n  "Roger Ingleton, _alias_ Robert Ratman."\r\n\r\nRoger read this remarkable epistle once or twice, in a state of mind\r\nbordering on stupefaction.  Robert Ratman, cad, sharper, blasphemer,\r\ninsolent profligate, his brother!  The notion was ludicrous.  And yet,\r\nwhen he tried to laugh, the laugh died on his lips.  He walked over to\r\nthe portrait on the wall and looked at the wild, mocking boy\'s face\r\nthere.  For a moment, as he met its gaze, it seemed to grow older and\r\ncoarser--the light died out of the eyes, the mouth lost its strength,\r\nthe lines of shame and vice came out on the brow.  Then the old face\r\nlooked out again--the face of the lost Roger Ingleton.\r\n\r\n"Ratman my brother!" he groaned to himself.\r\n\r\nThen of a sudden he seemed to see it all.  It was a fraud, an\r\nimposition, an impudent plot to extort money.  But no!  As he read the\r\nletter again that hope vanished.  This was not the letter of an\r\nimpostor.  Had it been, there would have been more about his rights,\r\nmore brotherly affection, a greater anxiety to appear in good colours.\r\nAs it was, the writer wrote in the reckless vein of a man who knows he\r\nis detested and expects little; who owes a grudge to fortune for his bad\r\nluck, and being hard up for money, appeals not to his rights, but to the\r\ngood nature of his more lucky younger brother.\r\n\r\nWhat a sad letter it seemed, read in that light.  And how every word\r\ndrove the unhappy heir of Maxfield deeper and deeper into the slough of\r\nperplexity.\r\n\r\nThree weeks ago, when his dead father\'s letter had come into his hands,\r\nhe had not hesitated for a moment as to his duty or his desire in the\r\nmatter.  He had cheerfully accepted the task of finding that lost,\r\naggrieved, perhaps hardly-used brother, to whom his heart went out as he\r\ngazed on the likeness of what he once had been.\r\n\r\nBut now!  To abdicate in favour of this blackguard.  To look for him, to\r\ntell him that Maxfield was his, to have to depend on his generosity for\r\na livelihood, to see the good name of Ingleton represented in the county\r\nby a drunken profligate.  What a task was that.  The writer evidently\r\ndid not know of the second will, or suspect that after all Maxfield was\r\nhis own.  No one knew of that document but Roger and Armstrong.  For a\r\nmoment there returned to the boy\'s mind the words of his father\'s\r\nletter--\r\n\r\n"If after reading the papers you choose to destroy them, no one will\r\nblame you; no one will know--you will do no one an injury.  You are free\r\nto act as you choose."\r\n\r\nAnd Armstrong, the only other being who had seen the papers, had urged\r\nhim to avail himself of the permission thus accorded.  Why not take the\r\nadvice and save Maxfield and the family name, and himself--ay, and\r\nRosalind--from the discredit that threatened.  He could yet be generous,\r\nbeyond his hopes, to the prodigal.  He would pay to get him abroad, to--\r\nto--\r\n\r\nA flush of shame mounted to the boy\'s cheeks as he suddenly discovered\r\nhimself listening to these unworthy suggestions.\r\n\r\n"Heaven help me," he said, "to be a man."  It was a brief inward fight,\r\nthough a sore one.\r\n\r\nRoger Ingleton, weak in body, often dull of wit and infirm of temper,\r\nhad yet certain old-fashioned ideas of his own as to how it behoves a\r\ngentleman to act.\r\n\r\nHe cherished, too, certain still older-fashioned ideas as to how when a\r\nChristian gentleman wants help and courage he may obtain it.  And he was\r\nendowed with that glorious obstinacy which, when it once satisfies\r\nitself on a question of right and wrong, declines to listen to argument.\r\n\r\nTherefore when, later than usual, he joined the family party at\r\nbreakfast, it was with a grim sense of a misery ahead to be faced, but\r\nby no manner of means to be avoided.\r\n\r\nFor fear the reader should be disposed to rank Roger at once among the\r\nsaints, let it be added that he took his place in as genuine a bad\r\ntemper as a strong mind and a weak body between them are capable of\r\ngenerating.\r\n\r\n"Roger, my dear boy," said the captain mournfully, as became the weeds\r\nhe wore, "you are looking poorly.  You need a change.  We both need one\r\nafter the trouble we have been through.  I think a run up to London\r\nwould brace us up.  Would you like it?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Roger shortly.  "I don\'t think so."\r\n\r\n"It is trying to you, I am sure, to remain here, in your delicate\r\nhealth, among so many sad associations--"\r\n\r\n"I\'m quite well, thank you," said the boy.  "Tom, how does the football\r\nget on?"\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Tom, rather taken aback by the introduction of so congenial a\r\ntheme from so unexpected a quarter, "I\'ve not played very much lately.\r\nJill and I had a little punt about yesterday; but we did it quite\r\nslowly, you know, and I had my crape on my arm."\r\n\r\nJill flushed up guiltily.  The housekeeper, who since Mrs Ingleton\'s\r\ndeath had assumed the moral direction of the young lady, had\r\nexpostulated with her in no mild terms on the iniquity of young ladies\r\nplaying football, even of a funereal order, and she felt it very\r\ntreacherous on the part of the faithless Tom to divulge her ill-doings\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nShe felt reassured, however, when Mr Armstrong smiled grimly.\r\n\r\n"Nobody could see," said she; "and Tom _did_ want a game so dreadfully."\r\n\r\n"We played Association," said Tom.  "Jill got two goals and I got fifty-\r\nsix."\r\n\r\n"No, I got three," said Jill.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that first wasn\'t a goal," said Tom.  "You see, she got past me\r\nwith a neat bit of dribbling; but she ran, and the rule was only to\r\nwalk, you know, because of being in mourning."\r\n\r\n"I really didn\'t run, I only walked very fast," said Jill.\r\n\r\n"I should think you might allow her the goal," said Mr Armstrong.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong was always coming to Jill\'s rescue; and if any of her\r\nheart had been left to win, he would have won it now.  Tom gave in, and\r\nsaid he supposed he would have to let her count it; and was vastly\r\nconsoled for his self-denial by Roger\'s proposal to join him in a game\r\nthat very day.\r\n\r\nBefore that important function came off, however, Roger and his tutor\r\nhad a somewhat uncomfortable talk in the library.\r\n\r\n"You are feeling out of sorts, old fellow," said the latter when they\r\nwere left alone.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve had a letter," said Roger.\r\n\r\n"Another?"\r\n\r\n"Read it, please."\r\n\r\n"If you wish it, I will.  Last time, however, it wasn\'t a success\r\nconsulting me."\r\n\r\n"I want you to read this."\r\n\r\nThe tutor took the letter and turned to the signature.\r\n\r\nHis brow knitted as he did so, and the lines grew deeper and more\r\nscornful as he turned to the beginning and read through.\r\n\r\n"If I were you," said he, returning it, "I would frame this letter as a\r\ngood specimen of a barefaced fraud."\r\n\r\nIt irritated Roger considerably, in his present over-wrought frame of\r\nmind--and particularly after the memorable inward struggle of that\r\nmorning--to have what seemed so serious a matter to him regarded by any\r\none else as a jest.  For once in a way the tutor failed to understand\r\nhis ward.\r\n\r\n"It does not seem to be a fraud at all," said Roger.  "Why didn\'t you\r\ntell me of it before?"\r\n\r\n"I did not regard the statement seriously.  Nor do I now.  There is lie\r\nwritten in every line of the letter.  A clumsy attempt to extort money,\r\nwhich ought not to be allowed to succeed.  He gives not a single proof\r\nof his identity.  I horsewhipped him on the night of your birthday for\r\ninsulting a lady, and--"\r\n\r\n"What lady?" asked Roger.\r\n\r\n"Miss Oliphant," said the tutor, flushing a little.  "He then, as a\r\ndesperate expedient for getting off the punishment he deserved, blurted\r\nout this preposterous story.  And having once published it, it appears\r\nhe means to make capital out of it.  Roger, old fellow, you are no\r\nfool."\r\n\r\n"I am fool enough to believe there is something in the story," said\r\nRoger; "at any rate I must follow it up.  If this Ratman is my\r\nbrother--"\r\n\r\nThe tutor, who himself was showing signs of irritation, laughed\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n"It may be a joke to you, but it is none to me," said Roger angrily.\r\n"It may not concern you--"\r\n\r\n"It concerns me very much," said the tutor.  "I am your guardian, and it\r\nis my duty to protect you from schemers."\r\n\r\nThe two stood looking at one another, and in that moment each relented a\r\nlittle of his anger.\r\n\r\n"I know, old fellow," said Roger, "you think you are doing me a\r\nkindness, but--"\r\n\r\n"Pardon me--kindness is not the word.  I appeal to your common-sense--"\r\n\r\nUnlucky speech!  Roger, who was painfully aware that he was not clever,\r\nwas naturally touchy at any reference to his common-sense.\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t seem much use discussing," said he.  "I made a mistake in\r\nshowing you the letter."\r\n\r\n"I heartily regret you did."\r\n\r\n"I hoped you would have helped me in my difficulty."\r\n\r\n"I will do anything for you except believe, without proof, and in spite\r\nof every probability, that Ratman is your brother."\r\n\r\n"He is just the age my brother would have been now."\r\n\r\n"So is George the coachman, so am I, so are half a dozen men in the\r\nvillage."\r\n\r\n"He certainly has some resemblance to the portrait."\r\n\r\n"I could find you a score more like it in London."\r\n\r\n"The long and short of it is, Armstrong, I cannot look to you to back me\r\nup in this."\r\n\r\n"To make Robert Ratman into Roger Ingleton?--I fear not.  To back you up\r\nin all else, and be at your call whether you think well or ill of me--\r\ncertainly."\r\n\r\nThey parted angrily, though without a quarrel.  Mr Armstrong had rarely\r\nfelt himself so put out, and crashed away ruthlessly at his piano all\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nRoger, perhaps conscious that logic was not on his side, whatever\r\ninstinct and feeling might be, retired disappointed and miserable to the\r\npark, and never remembered his appointment with the eager Tom.\r\n\r\nAt lunch-time he said to Captain Oliphant--\r\n\r\n"When did you think of going to town?"\r\n\r\n"At the end of the week, my boy.  What do you say to coming?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--I\'ll come."\r\n\r\nThe Captain darted a triumphant glance in the direction of the tutor.\r\nBut the tutor was investigating the contents of a game pie in the\r\nendeavour to discover a piece of egg for Miss Jill.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause that young lady took up her discourse.\r\n\r\n"If father and Roger go to town, Tom, we shall have dear Mr Armstrong\r\nall to ourselves."\r\n\r\n"Hooroo!" said Tom; "that is, if it\'s holidays."\r\n\r\n"I am thinking of going to Oxford next week," said the tutor,\r\nelaborately folding up his napkin, addressing his co-trustee.  "Have you\r\nany message I can give to any of your acquaintances there?"\r\n\r\n"I think it would be a pity for you to leave Maxfield just now.  One of\r\nus should remain."\r\n\r\n"Yes, do stay.  We\'ll have such larks," said Tom.  "We\'ll get Rosalind\r\nto come and stay, and then we shall be able to play regular matches,\r\nladies against gentlemen, you know."\r\n\r\n"No.  Mr Armstrong and I will stand Rosalind and you," suggested Jill.\r\n\r\nEven these allurements failed.\r\n\r\n"I shall make my visit as short as possible.  I have, as you know, a few\r\ncreditors in Oxford on whom I am anxious to call.  Let me give you a\r\nlittle cheese, Roger."\r\n\r\nThat evening when, as usual, the tutor looked in to say good night to\r\nhis ward, Roger said rather gloomily--\r\n\r\n"I suppose you object to my going to London?"\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, I rather envy you."\r\n\r\n"Of course you understand I am going up to make inquiries?"\r\n\r\n"Naturally.  With Captain Oliphant\'s assistance?"\r\n\r\n"No.  I\'m not inclined to tell him anything at present.  He has no idea\r\nthat Ratman is anything but an Indian acquaintance."\r\n\r\n"My address will be `"Green Dragon," Oxford,\'" said the tutor.\r\n\r\n"By the way," said Roger--both men were talking in the forced tones\r\nwhich belong to an unacknowledged estrangement--"Whether this matter is\r\nright or not, I propose to write to Ratman and enclose him L10."\r\n\r\n"Naturally," said the tutor.\r\n\r\n"I am tied down, as you know, in the matter of my pocket-money, and\r\ncan\'t well spare it out of my present allowance.  I want the trustees to\r\ngive me an extra allowance."\r\n\r\n"In other words, you want your trustees to keep Mr Robert Ratman at the\r\nrate of L250 a year.  I shall agree to that the day that he satisfies me\r\nhe is Roger Ingleton."\r\n\r\n"I expected you would refuse.  I must ask Captain Oliphant."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid he will require my sanction to any such arrangement."\r\n\r\n"What!  Do you mean to say that I am at your mercy in a matter like\r\nthis?"\r\n\r\n"I fear that is unhappily the case.  I can resolve the matter by\r\nresigning my tutorship."\r\n\r\nHad it come to that?  Roger glanced up with a scared look which for the\r\nmoment clouded out the vexation in his face.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, Armstrong.  All this worry is bad for my temper.  I\'m afraid\r\nI lost it."\r\n\r\n"I can sympathise," said the tutor, "for I have lost mine.  Good night."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\nROGER SEES A LITTLE TOO MUCH LIFE.\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant\'s motive for going to London was primarily to escape\r\nfor a while from the unearthly dullness of Maxfield.  As long as the\r\nprospect of a matrimonial alliance with Mrs Ingleton had been in view,\r\nit had seemed to him good policy to submit to the infliction and remain\r\nat his post.  That vision was now unhappily past, and the good man felt\r\nhe deserved a change of scene and amusement.  A further motive was to\r\nevade a possible return of his dear friend Mr Ratman, whose abrupt\r\ndeparture from Maxfield had both perplexed and relieved him.  The second\r\nof that gentleman\'s uncomfortable bills was falling due in a few days,\r\nand as on the present occasion no lucky windfall had dropped in from an\r\nAmerican mayor, it seemed altogether a fitting occasion for dropping for\r\na season below the horizon.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, Roger unexpectedly consented to accompany his guardian,\r\nthe visit assumed an altogether different aspect.  The captain had long\r\ndesired to have his dear ward to himself, and the opportunity now\r\npresented was certainly one not to be neglected.\r\n\r\n"My dear boy," said he, as the two took their places in the London\r\ntrain, "I hope you are well protected against the weather.  Change seats\r\nwith me.  You are so liable to cold, you know, that it is really hardly\r\nsafe for you to face the engine.  We must take great care of you now--\r\ngreater than ever," and he sighed pathetically.\r\n\r\nRoger was getting accustomed to, and a little tired of, these\r\ndemonstrative outbursts, and quietly took the seat in order to spare\r\ndiscussion.  He was already repenting of his journey.  No one seemed to\r\ncommend it.  Armstrong made no reference to it.\r\n\r\nDr Brandram stoutly disapproved of it.  Rosalind tossed her head when\r\nshe heard of it, and hoped he might enjoy himself.  Tom failed to see\r\nwhy, when there was football in the air at Maxfield, any one could be\r\nbothered to travel up to London for pleasure, unless indeed he intended\r\nto take a season ticket for Christy\'s Minstrels.  Altogether Roger did\r\nnot feel elated at the prospect of this visit.  For all that, he\r\npersuaded himself that duty called him thither, even if it was bad\r\ntemper which drove him from Maxfield.\r\n\r\n"What has become of Ratman?" he inquired of his guardian casually during\r\nthe journey.\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant looked up from his paper sharply Mr Ratman\'s\r\nwhereabouts had been occupying his thoughts that very moment.\r\n\r\n"I really do not know, my boy," said he.  "He left very suddenly, and in\r\nthe sad trouble through which we have passed I have hardly had time to\r\nthink about him."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.  Then Roger said--\r\n\r\n"Is he an old friend of yours, cousin Edward?"\r\n\r\nCousin Edward was a little perplexed by this curiosity.\r\n\r\n"I have known him a year or so.  The friendship, however, is chiefly on\r\nhis side."\r\n\r\n"I thought he came all the way from India on purpose to visit you?"\r\n\r\nThe captain laughed uncomfortably at this very correct representation of\r\nthe facts.\r\n\r\n"That is the version he likes to give.  The fact is that business\r\nbrought him home, and as he knew I was at Maxfield, he wrote and\r\nproposed the visit.  He is no great favourite of yours, I suspect,\r\nRoger?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Roger shortly, and relapsed again into silence.  But before\r\nthe journey\'s end he once more returned to the charge.\r\n\r\n"Was he in the army in India?"\r\n\r\n"Once, I believe.  But I have never heard much of his antecedents.\r\nLatterly I believe he called himself a financial agent, a very vague\r\nprofession.  He was in our station before our regiment went there."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he had lived in India all his life?"\r\n\r\n"He had certainly been in England when a young man," said the captain;\r\n"and from some of his reminiscences, appears not to have led a very\r\nprofitable life there.  But how comes it you are so interested in him?"\r\n\r\n"I have only been wondering what he was, that\'s all," said Roger,\r\nfeeling he had been on the topic long enough.\r\n\r\nRoger had already written a letter to Ratman, addressed to that\r\ngentleman at the General Post Office, London.\r\n\r\n"Your letter," it said, "has perplexed me greatly.  If you are my\r\nbrother, as you say you are, why do you not give some proof?  That\r\nshould be easy.  There must be some people who can identify you, or some\r\nmeans of satisfying us all about your claim to be the elder son.  I\r\nshould not resist you, if it were so.  Only my guardians would require\r\nclear proof before recognising you.  As to whether I think well or ill\r\nof you, that has nothing to do with the matter if you are really and\r\ntruly my elder brother.  I enclose ten pounds in this, not to show you\r\nthat I am myself fully satisfied, but to let you see that the bare\r\nchance of your being an Ingleton makes me feel anxious you should not\r\nthink we, as a family, do not stand by one another.  I do not expect to\r\nbe able to repeat it, as my allowance is limited, and my guardians are\r\nnot likely to consent to hand over any money for you till you can prove\r\nyour claim.  Write and give me more particulars, and I promise you I\r\nshall not shirk my duty to you or the name I bear."\r\n\r\nAt any other time Roger would have shown this epistle, the writing of\r\nwhich cost him many anxious hours, to Armstrong.  Now, however, that\r\nhelp was denied him.  The tutor, he knew, would have screwed his eye-\r\nglass into his eye and ruthlessly pulled the document to pieces.  No.\r\nHe must play this game off his own bat, and keep his own counsel.\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant, who had a good notion of doing things comfortably with\r\nother people\'s money, had selected a fashionable hotel at the West End.\r\n\r\n"We must see you have every comfort, dear boy," said he; "in your state\r\nof health we cannot afford to rough it.  I have ordered a private\r\nsitting-room and fires in the bedroom.  When you feel strong enough we\r\nwill do a little sight-seeing; but meanwhile your first consideration\r\nmust be to recover lost tone and spirits by means of rest and care."\r\n\r\nThese constant reminders of his poor health were very unwelcome to the\r\nunlucky Roger, who protested that he was in perfect health; and, to\r\nprove it, went out next day, in a cold November fog, with no overcoat.\r\nThe consequence was he caught a severe cold, and had the mortification\r\nof listening to a severe lecture from his solicitous guardian on the\r\niniquity of trifling with his precious health.\r\n\r\nRoger, too proud to admit that he could not take care of himself,\r\ndeclined to treat himself as an invalid, and insisted on claiming his\r\nguardian\'s promise to show him a little life in the great city.\r\n\r\nIt was surprising how many acquaintances Rosalind\'s father had in\r\nLondon.  Some were pleasant enough--military men on leave, and here and\r\nthere a civilian\'s family who remembered the captain and his charming\r\nfamily in the Hills.\r\n\r\nRoger accepted their hospitality and listened to their Indian small-talk\r\nwith great good-humour, and when now and then some sympathetic soul,\r\nguessing, as a good many did, one of the lad\'s secrets, talked\r\nadmiringly of Rosalind, he felt himself rewarded for a good deal of\r\nlong-suffering.  Had he heard some of the jokes passed behind his back,\r\nhis satisfaction might have been considerably tempered.\r\n\r\n"I always said," observed one shrewd dowager, "that Oliphant would make\r\na catch with that daughter of his.  He has done it, evidently.  This boy\r\nwill be worth five or ten thousand a year, I hear."\r\n\r\n"Poor fellow!  He looks as if it will be a battle with him to reach it.\r\nWhat a cough!"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t understand Oliphant not taking better care of him.  He drags\r\nhim about all over town, as if the boy were cast iron.  I met them out\r\ntwice this week."\r\n\r\n"Certainly one cannot afford to play fast and loose with the goose that\r\nlays the golden eggs."\r\n\r\nThe "goose" in question made other acquaintances than these.  In his\r\nbachelor days Captain Oliphant had "knocked about" in London pretty\r\nconsiderably, and had a notion, now that he was a bachelor again, to\r\nrepeat the process.  Roger--a raw country boy, as the reader by this\r\ntime will admit--found himself entered upon a gay round of club and\r\nBohemian life, which to an old stager like the captain may have seemed a\r\nlittle slow, but to a susceptible youth was decidedly attractive.  The\r\nguardian\'s fast acquaintances made the young heir of Maxfield welcome,\r\nand might have proceeded to pluck him had his protector permitted.\r\nRoger speedily discovered what hundreds of locks there are which the\r\nmere rumour of money will unlock.  He had never had such an idea of his\r\nown importance before, and for a short time he deluded himself into the\r\nbelief that his popularity was due wholly and solely to his personal\r\nmerits.\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant fostered this delusion carefully.\r\n\r\n"I hope you are enjoying yourself, my dear boy," he would say, after a\r\nparticularly festive evening.\r\n\r\n"It\'s an excellent rule to make oneself agreeable in all circumstances.\r\nI envy you your facility.  You see how it is appreciated.  It does an\r\nold fogey like me good to see you enjoy yourself."\r\n\r\n"It was a pleasant enough evening," said Roger, not quite without\r\nmisgivings on the subject, however.\r\n\r\n"By the way, who was the man, older than the others, who talked loudest\r\nand not always in the most classical English?"\r\n\r\nThe captain laughed pleasantly.\r\n\r\n"No.  I should have been better pleased if he had not been of our party.\r\nHe never was select, even in my young days, when I met him once or\r\ntwice.  There used to be a saying among us that Fastnet, if he gave his\r\nmind to it--"\r\n\r\n"Fastnet!"\r\n\r\nThe cab was dark, and the boy\'s pale face was invisible to his guardian.\r\nBut the tone with which he caught at the name struck that good\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n"Yes.  What about it?"\r\n\r\n"Only," said Roger, after half a minute, and he spoke with an unusual\r\neffort, "it seems a good name for him."\r\n\r\nAlone in his room that night Roger came to himself.  A week or two ago\r\nhe had hugged himself into the notion he was resolved to do his duty at\r\nall costs and in spite of all discouragement.  Here had he been wasting\r\na fortnight, forgetting duty, forgetting that he had a mission, posing\r\nas the heir, and accepting the compliments of a lot of time-servers who,\r\nnow that he thought about them, valued him for nothing but his name and\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\nAnd one of these--the least desirable of the lot--had been this Fastnet,\r\nthe companion in profligacy of his lost brother, the one man, perhaps,\r\nfrom whom he might hope to obtain a clue as to the fate or whereabouts\r\nof the man whose rights he, Roger, was usurping!\r\n\r\nHe was tempted to telegraph to Armstrong to come to his help.  But he\r\ndismissed the thought.  In this quest Armstrong was not with him.  He\r\nshrank from making a confidant of the captain.  There was no one else to\r\nhelp him.  He must play the game single-handed or not at all.\r\n\r\nOnce more his courage failed.  Ratman his brother, Fastnet his brother\'s\r\nfriend!  At what a cost to the good name of his house was this wrong to\r\nbe put right, this self-sacrifice to be accomplished.  But ere he slept\r\nthe honest man gained a victory over the poltroon.  Providence had sent\r\nhim stumbling into the track.  It was not for him to draw back.\r\n\r\nNext morning both he and his guardian found letters on the breakfast-\r\ntable re-directed in Rosalind\'s hand from Maxfield.  The latter, as he\r\nglanced at his, scowled, and crushed the missive angrily into his\r\npocket.  It was a letter from Ratman, reminding him that a certain bill\r\nwas falling due on the following day, and requiring him, on pain of\r\nexposure, to honour it.\r\n\r\nRoger\'s letter was in the same hand.  It was dated London, a day or two\r\nback.  Ratman said--\r\n\r\n"Dear Brother,--I received your letter and enclosure.  It is what I\r\nexpected from you, but I hope it is not to be the last.  I don\'t wonder\r\nat your suspecting my story--I don\'t particularly care whether you\r\nbelieve it or not.  No doubt, with your respectable surroundings and the\r\nprospect before you, you are not over-anxious to claim brotherhood with\r\na fellow of my sort.  As long as you believe in me sufficiently not to\r\nleave me in the lurch, I shall be fairly content.  But I cannot live on\r\nair, and have little else to support me.  Don\'t be afraid I shall turn\r\nup again now until you want me.  If I did, it would be not so much to\r\nsee you as to see some one else to whom, rake as I am, I have lost my\r\nheart, and to whom I look to you to put in a good word on my behalf.\r\nYou ask for proofs.  I can\'t give you any that I know of.  Everything is\r\nchanged at Maxfield since I was there.  Even the old hands like Dr\r\nBrandram or Hodder would not recognise me after all these years.  In\r\nfact, they have seen me and have not done so.  They think I\'m dead.\r\nThat\'s my fault; for when I was ill in India--goodness knows how many\r\nyears ago--with, as I thought, not a day more to live, I told a comrade\r\nto send home news of my death, and they all believed it.  So you see it\r\nis easier to talk about proof than give it.  The only person who might\r\nbe able to remember me after I left home--I had a hideous row with my\r\nfather at the time--was a man called Fastnet, with whom I lodged in\r\nLondon, and who helped to make me the respectable specimen of humanity I\r\nhave become.  I lost sight of him long since, and for all I know he has\r\njoined the majority with all the others.  I merely mention this to show\r\nyou how hopeless it is of me to attempt to prove what I say.  You may\r\nmake your mind quite easy on that score.  I shall probably return to\r\nIndia as soon as I am in funds.  Except for the one reason I have named,\r\nI don\'t want to see Maxfield again--I\'ve had enough of it.  Nor do I see\r\nany advantage in meeting you, so I give no address.  But any letters\r\naddressed to the G.P.O.  I shall receive.\r\n\r\n"Your brother,--\r\n\r\n"Roger Ingleton."\r\n\r\nThis letter dispelled any lingering doubt, or perhaps hope, in Roger\'s\r\nmind that he was on a wrong scent.  The writer, in protesting his\r\ninability to give any proof of his identity, had mentioned the two very\r\ncircumstances which the old Squire had referred to in his posthumous\r\nletter.  He had admitted that he had gone to the bad in London in\r\ncompany with a youth named Fastnet.  The news of his death had reached\r\nEngland from abroad.  Besides, the reckless, devil-may-care tone of the\r\nepistle more than ever convinced the younger brother that this was no\r\nfraudulent claimant, but the honest growl of an outcast who little\r\nguessed what his name was worth to him.  Otherwise, why should he keep\r\nout of the way?\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant came to his room while these reflections were occupying\r\nhis mind.  He was too much preoccupied by the unpleasant contents of his\r\nown letter to notice the trouble of his ward.\r\n\r\n"Roger," said he, "business calls me away from town for a day or two.  I\r\nam sorry to interrupt our pleasant time together, but I hope it will not\r\nbe long.  Make yourself comfortable here, and take care of yourself."\r\n\r\n"Are you going to Maxfield?" inquired Roger.\r\n\r\n"No.  But an old comrade I find is in trouble and wants my advice.  It\r\nis a call I can hardly turn a deaf ear to."\r\n\r\nHad Roger guessed that the friend on whom so much devotion was to be\r\nexpended was Mr Robert Ratman, he would have displayed a good deal more\r\ncuriosity than he did as to his guardian\'s business.  As it was, he was\r\nnot sorry to be left thus to his own devices.\r\n\r\n"You know your way to the club by this time," said the captain.  "Make\r\nyourself at home there--and keep out of mischief."\r\n\r\nThat evening Roger went somewhat nervously to his guardian\'s club.\r\nSince last night he had grown to detest the place and the company.  But\r\njust now it was the one place where he might expect to hear something of\r\nhis lost brother.\r\n\r\nHis new friends greeted him boisterously--and, relieved of the restraint\r\nof his guardian\'s presence, made more than usually merry in his honour.\r\n\r\nThey chaffed him about his expectations, and quizzed him about Rosalind.\r\nThey laughed at his rustic simplicity, and amused themselves by putting\r\nhim to the blush.  They plied him with wine and cigars, and rallied him\r\non his pure demure face.  One or two toadies sidled up and professed a\r\nsympathy which was more offensive than the badinage.\r\n\r\nHe endured all as best he could, for one reason and one only.  The\r\nloudest and coarsest of his tormentors was Mr Fastnet.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, when, not for the first time, Rosalind\'s name had been\r\ndragged into the conversation, the blood of the Ingletons rose.\r\n\r\nThe man who had spoken was a young _roue_, little more than Roger\'s own\r\nage, and reputed to be a great man in the circles of the fast.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," said Roger, abruptly interrupting the laugh that followed\r\nthis hero\'s jest, "do you call yourself a gentleman?"\r\n\r\nA bombshell on the floor could hardly have made a greater sensation.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I mean, sir, that you\'re not a gentleman."\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman staggered back as if he had been shot, and gaped\r\nround the audience, speechless.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, hullo," said some one, "this is getting lively."\r\n\r\nAnother of the party walked to the door and turned the key, and several\r\nothers hastily finished up the contents of their glasses.\r\n\r\nRoger needed all his nerve to keep cool under the circumstances, but he\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned to the young gentleman, whose move it clearly was\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nHe was very red in his face and threatening in his demeanour, but when\r\nit came to giving his feelings utterance his courage dwindled down into\r\na--\r\n\r\n"Bah! sanctimonious young prig!"\r\n\r\nThe astonishment was now transferred to the onlookers.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Compton, I say," said Fastnet, "did you hear what he called you?\r\nIs that all you\'ve got to say?"\r\n\r\nThe Honourable Mr Compton\'s face gradually bleached, as he looked from\r\none to the other.\r\n\r\n"He said you were no gentleman," repeated Fastnet, determined there\r\nshould be no mistake about the matter.  "Isn\'t that so, youngster?"\r\nappealing to Roger.\r\n\r\n"That is what I said," said Roger.\r\n\r\nThe lily-livered hero was hanging out his true colours at last.\r\n\r\n"It\'s lucky for him," snarled he, "he is only a visitor in this house."\r\n\r\nFastnet and one or two of the others laughed disagreeably.\r\n\r\n"Ingleton," said the former, taking control of the proceedings\r\ngenerally, "are you willing to repeat what you said outside?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly," said Roger; "anywhere you like.  And I shall be delighted\r\nto add that he is a coward."\r\n\r\n"There, Compton.  Surely that satisfies you?"\r\n\r\nMr Compton, very white and downcast, took up his hat.\r\n\r\n"Thank you," said he, with a pitiful affectation of superciliousness; "I\r\ntake no notice of young bumpkins like him," and he turned on his heel.\r\n\r\nFastnet stepped before him to the door.\r\n\r\n"Look here, Compton," said he, "you\'re a member of this club.  Do we\r\nunderstand you funk this affair?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve something better to do than bother my head about him.  Understand\r\nwhat you like.  Let me go!"\r\n\r\nFastnet opened the door.\r\n\r\n"Clear out!" said he, with an oath; "and don\'t show your face here\r\nagain, unless you want to be kicked."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by that?"\r\n\r\n"What I say.  Be off, or I won\'t wait till you come again."\r\n\r\nWhereupon exit the Honourable Mr Compton with colours dipped.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Fastnet, when he had gone, "it is only fair to the youngster\r\nhere to say that we agree with him in his opinion of our late member.\r\nEh, you men?"\r\n\r\nGeneral assent greeted the question.  Upon which Mr Fastnet suggested\r\nthat, as the evening had been spoiled, the house do adjourn.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better come and have supper with me," said he to Roger.\r\n\r\nAnd Roger, feeling his chance had come, accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\n"WHEN THE CAT\'S AWAY--"\r\n\r\nMaxfield Manor, however cheery a place in summer-time, with its\r\nhousehold in full swing, was decidedly desolate in dark November\r\nweather, with only a housekeeper in charge--that is to say, to any one\r\nbut the two young persons on whom the honours of the house devolved, it\r\nwould have appeared dull.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong delayed his visit to Oxford for some days after the\r\ndeparture of the Captain and Roger.  There was a good deal of business\r\nto be done in connection with the estate, and as Mr Pottinger\r\ndiscovered, when the second trustee did take it into his head to look\r\ninto things, it was no child\'s play.  He had an uncomfortable manner,\r\nthis tutor, of demanding explanations and particulars with all the air\r\nof the proprietor himself, and was not to be put off by any dilatory\r\ntactics on the part of the official with whom the explanation lay.  As\r\nin the present case the business transacted was chiefly in connection\r\nwith leases and conveyances, the unfortunate lawyer had a rough week of\r\nit, and felt at the end very much like one of his own clients after a\r\nyear in Chancery.  However, the inquisitor appeared to be fairly well\r\nsatisfied when all was done, so that Mr Pottinger, who all along had on\r\nhis mind the uncomfortable consciousness of a few well-hidden\r\nirregularities, was doubly relieved when the tutor dropped his glass\r\nfinally from his eye and observed--\r\n\r\n"I need not trouble you further at present, sir."\r\n\r\nIt was after this final interview that Mr Armstrong looked in on his\r\nfriend the doctor.\r\n\r\n"I\'m off to Oxford for a day or two," said he.\r\n\r\n"No attractions here?" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Yes--you among others."\r\n\r\n"And who\'s to wash and dress the babies at Maxfield?  And who is to keep\r\nthe wolf from the fold at the Vicarage? and who is to keep an eye on the\r\nman of the law across the way?"\r\n\r\n"The babes are well qualified to nurture one another.  The man of the\r\nlaw is under closer observation than he imagines.  As to the wolf, I\r\ncame to speak to you about that.  He may make a descent on the fold, in\r\nwhich case Dr Brandram must go out with swords and staves and give him\r\nbattle."\r\n\r\nThe doctor laughed.\r\n\r\n"I like your ideas of the medical profession.  Its duties are variegated\r\nand lively.  However, make yourself easy this time.  I hear to-day that\r\nthe young ladies at the Vicarage with their governess are to go on\r\nMonday to Devonshire."\r\n\r\n"Good," said Mr Armstrong, decidedly relieved.\r\n\r\n"When does your ward return?" said the doctor.  "I dislike this London\r\nbusiness altogether.  Oliphant is not to be trusted with a boy of his\r\ndelicate make.  You should have stopped it."\r\n\r\nThe tutor said nothing, but looked decidedly dejected.  He was greatly\r\ntempted to confide the difficulties of the situation to his friend.  But\r\nthe dead Squire\'s secret was not his to give away.\r\n\r\n"Unless they come home soon," said he, "I have a notion of returning\r\nfrom Oxford by way of London."\r\n\r\n"Do--the sooner the better."\r\n\r\nWhen, on the next day, Miss Rosalind sailed up to Maxfield to bid her\r\nbrother and sister farewell, it fell to the tutor\'s lot to escort her\r\nback to the Vicarage.\r\n\r\n"Mr Armstrong," said she abruptly, as they went, "why have you and\r\nRoger quarrelled?"\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong looked round uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n"Quarrelled?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  Do you suppose he would go away like this for any other reason?\r\nWon\'t you tell me what it is about?"\r\n\r\n"Roger and I have agreed to differ on a certain point.  Miss Oliphant.\r\nWe have not quarrelled?"\r\n\r\n"You cannot trust me, I see, or you would tell me what the trouble is."\r\n\r\n"I trust you completely, Miss Oliphant.  I will gladly tell you."\r\n\r\nFive minutes ago wild horses would not have extorted the confession from\r\nhim.  But somehow or other, as he looked at her standing there, he could\r\nnot help himself.\r\n\r\n"Roger has got an impression that his elder brother is still living, and\r\nis to be found; and, if found, that he ought to be made possessor of\r\nMaxfield.  I am unable to sympathise in what I look upon as an\r\nunprofitable quest.  That is the whole story."\r\n\r\n"Why cannot you back him up, Mr Armstrong?"\r\n\r\n"I believe his fancy is utterly groundless; besides which, if the person\r\nhe believes to be the missing brother is really Roger Ingleton, to\r\ndiscover him would mean disgrace to Maxfield, and an injury to the name\r\nof Ingleton."\r\n\r\n"What!  Mr Armstrong, do you mean to say--"\r\n\r\n"I mean to say that Mr Robert Ratman claims to be the lost elder\r\nbrother, and that Roger credits the story.  Miss Oliphant, I am grateful\r\nto you for sharing this confidence with me.  You can help Roger in this\r\nmatter better than I can."\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with a flush in her face, and then replied rather\r\ndismally, "I fear not--for, to be as frank with you as you are with me,\r\nI am dreadfully afraid Roger is right.  The same fancy passed through my\r\nmind when first I saw Mr Ratman.  I had recently been studying the lost\r\nbrother\'s portrait, you know, and was struck and horrified by the\r\nresemblance.  Mr Armstrong," added she, after a pause, "if I were\r\nRoger\'s guardian and tutor, I would stand by him all the more that his\r\nduty is an unpleasant one.  Thank you; here we are at the gate.  Good-\r\nbye.  I hope you will have a pleasant time at Oxford."\r\n\r\nAnd she passed in, leaving the good man in a sad state of bewilderment\r\nand perplexity.\r\n\r\nHe started a day or two later in a somewhat depressed frame of mind for\r\nOxford, where he astonished and delighted most of his old creditors by\r\ncalling and paying off a further instalment of his debts to them.  But\r\nhis satisfaction in this act of restitution was sadly tempered by the\r\nsense of coercion put upon him by the doctor and Rosalind, and the\r\nconviction that, wise or foolish, pleasant or unpleasant, his place was\r\nat his young pupil\'s side.  No excuse, or pleadings of a false pride,\r\ncould dispel the feeling.  No, he must climb down, own himself wrong,\r\nand sue for permission to assist in a quest in which he had little faith\r\nand still less inclination.\r\n\r\nWhile he is making up his mind, it may be worth the reader\'s while to\r\nremark what was happening at Maxfield.\r\n\r\nTom and Jill woke one morning to discover themselves lord and lady of\r\nthe situation.  In their lamentations, not unmingled with a sense of\r\ninjury, at the desertion of which they were the victims, it had not\r\noccurred to them to realise that there were alleviating circumstances in\r\ntheir forlorn condition.\r\n\r\nThe great manor-house was theirs--library, dining-hall, corridors,\r\nhaunted chamber, roof, cellars--all except the servant\'s hall and the\r\nroom where Mrs Parker, the housekeeper, held austere sway.  The park\r\nwas theirs, the woods, the stream, the paddocks, and the live-stock.\r\nNay, when they came to reckon all up, half the county was theirs, and a\r\nmile or so of sea-beach into the bargain.\r\n\r\nThey were absolutely free to roam where they liked, do what they liked,\r\neat what they liked, and sit up at night to any hour that pleased them.\r\nMrs Parker, good soul, though excellent in academic exhortations and\r\nprohibitions, was too infirm to put her laws into active practice; and\r\nwhen, a day or two after the place had been left in her charge, she\r\nsuccumbed to a touch of her enemy, the lumbago, and had to take to her\r\nbed, these two young persons, though extremely sorry for her misfortune,\r\nfelt that the whole world lay like a glorious football at their feet.\r\n\r\n"Good old Jilly!" exclaimed Tom in his balmiest mood one morning, when\r\nthese two young prodigals assembled for breakfast in the big dining-room\r\nat the fashionable hour of eleven, with Raffles in full livery to attend\r\nupon them.  "This is what I call a lark and a half.  Raffles, pass Miss\r\nJill the honey; and walk about, and make yourself useful.  I tell you\r\nwhat, we\'ll go and have a snap at the pheasants, and try a few drop\r\nkicks over the Martyr\'s oak.  What do you say?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t shoot awfully well," said Jill apologetically.  "I\'d sooner, if\r\nyou don\'t mind, Tom, walk about on the roof, or help you let the water\r\nout of the big pond."\r\n\r\n"Raffles, old chappie, more toast--a lot more toast for Miss Jill.  I\'ll\r\nhave a wing of something myself.  The fact is, Jilly," said he, when\r\nRaffles had departed on his quest, "I wanted to get the beast out of the\r\nway while I told you I\'d got an idea."\r\n\r\n"Oh, _what_, Tom?" asked Jill, in tones of surprised pleasure.  Tom\r\nglanced round cautiously, and then whispered, "You and I\'ll give a small\r\nkick-up here on our own hooks.  What do you say?"\r\n\r\n"A party!  Oh Tom! how clever of you to think of that!"\r\n\r\n"You see," said Tom, accepting the homage meekly, "the other day in the\r\nlibrary, when we were turning out all the drawers, I found a whole lot\r\nof `At Home\' cards, and the list of fellows that were asked to Roger\'s\r\nbirthday party."\r\n\r\n"How lovely!" exclaimed Jill; "we\'ll just--"\r\n\r\nBut here the return of Raffles, and a significant scowl from Tom, warned\r\nher to defer her suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe meal over, the conspirators met in the library, and put their heads\r\ntogether over Tom\'s documents.\r\n\r\n"That\'s about the ticket, isn\'t it?" said he, displaying one of the\r\ninvitation cards which he had experimentally filled up.\r\n\r\n  "_Dr Brandram_--\r\n\r\n  "_Mr and Miss Oliphant at home on Wednesday, December 2, at 7\r\n  o\'clock.  Music, dancing, fireworks, etcetera_.\r\n\r\n  "_R.S.V.P_."\r\n\r\n"But we haven\'t got any fireworks," suggested Jill; "we\'ll have to get\r\nsome.  And what about the band?"\r\n\r\n"I shall write to the Colonel of the Grenadiers and order it.  Anyhow,\r\nyou can play the Goblin polka if we get stuck up."\r\n\r\nJill wondered whether, after an hour or two, her one piece (even though\r\ndear Mr Armstrong liked it) might not pall on a large assembly, and she\r\ndevoutly hoped the Grenadiers would accept.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a hundred and fifty names down," said Tom.  "May as well have\r\nthe lot while we\'re about it."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t two days rather a short invitation?" asked Jill.\r\n\r\n"Bless you, no.  You see, we\'re not out of mourning.  Besides, Mother\r\nParker may be well again if we don\'t look sharp, or Armstrong may turn\r\nup."\r\n\r\n"How I wish he would!"\r\n\r\n"He\'d spoil everything.  Look here, Jill, look alive and write the\r\ncards.  I\'ll call out."\r\n\r\nThe two spent a most industrious morning, so much so that the household\r\nmarvelled at their goodness, and remarked to one another, "The children\r\nare no trouble at all."\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the sitting Tom flung down his paper with a whistle\r\nof dismay.\r\n\r\n"I say, Jill, they ought to be black-edged!"\r\n\r\nJill turned pale.\r\n\r\n"What is to be done?" she gasped.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll have to doctor them with pen and ink," said Tom.\r\n\r\nSo for another hour or so they occupied themselves painfully in putting\r\ntheir invitations into mourning.  The result was not wholly\r\nsatisfactory, for a card dipped edgeways into a shallow plate of ink is\r\napt to take on its black unevenly.  So that while some of the guests\r\nwere invited with signs of the slightest sorrow, the company of others\r\nwas requested with tokens of the deepest bereavement.  However, on the\r\nwhole the result was passable, and that evening Tom slunk down to Yeld\r\npost office with a bundle under his arm.  At the last moment a\r\ndifficulty had arisen with regard to postage, as, between them, the two\r\ncould not raise the thirteen shillings required to stamp the lot.\r\nHowever, by a lucky accident Tom discovered a bundle of halfpenny\r\nwrappers, the property of the estate, which (after scrupulously writing\r\nan I.O.U. for the amount) he borrowed.\r\n\r\n"Saved a clean six-and-six by that," he remarked, when the last was\r\nlicked up; "that\'ll go into the fireworks."\r\n\r\nJill, whose admiration for her brother\'s genius knew no bounds, felt\r\nalmost happy.\r\n\r\nIt was Monday evening when the Yeld post-master was exercised in his\r\nmind by hearing a loud rap down-stairs, which on inquiry he found to\r\nhave proceeded from the discharge of 150 mysterious-looking halfpenny\r\nmissives, written in a very round hand, into his box.  Being an active\r\nand intelligent person, he felt it his duty to examine one, addressed,\r\nas it happened, to the Duke of Somewhere.  After some consideration, and\r\na study of his rules and regulations, he came to the conclusion that the\r\nenclosure was of the nature of a letter, and thereupon proceeded to mark\r\neach with a claim for a penny excess postage.  Which done, he retired to\r\nhis parlour, relieved in his mind.\r\n\r\nTom and Jill had more to do than to speculate on the adventures of their\r\ncarefully-written cards.\r\n\r\n"Now about grub!" said Tom that evening.\r\n\r\nOnce more Jill turned a little pale.  She had been dreading this fateful\r\nquestion all along.\r\n\r\n"What do you think?" said she diplomatically.\r\n\r\nTom, of course, had thought the problem out.\r\n\r\n"We must keep it dark from the slaveys," said he, "at least till\r\neverybody comes, then they\'re bound to give us a leg up.  I fancy we can\r\nscrape a thing or two up from what\'s in the house.  And I\'ve called in\r\nat one or two of the shops at Yeld and told them to send up some things\r\naddressed to `Miss J.  Oliphant--private.\'  There was rather a nice lot\r\nof herrings just in, so I got three dozen of them cheap.  Then I told\r\nthem at the confectioner\'s to send up all the strawberry ices they could\r\nin the time, and 150 buns.  You see everybody is sure not to come, so\r\nthere\'ll be plenty to go round."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t Mr Rusk ask what they were for?" inquired Jill.\r\n\r\n"I said Mr Oliphant presented his kind regards, and would be glad to\r\nhave the things sharp."\r\n\r\nNext morning, greatly to the delight of the hospitable pair, the\r\nherrings came up in a basket, addressed privately to Miss Jill.  Later\r\nin the day tradesmen\'s carts rattled up the back drive with similar\r\nmissives, not a little to the bewilderment of the servants of the house,\r\nwho shook their heads and wished Mrs Parker would make a speedy\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nTom adroitly captured the booty, and half won over Raffles to aid and\r\nabet in the great undertaking.\r\n\r\n"Good old Raffy," said he, as the two staggered across the hall with one\r\nof Miss Jill\'s private boxes between them; "would you like a threepenny\r\nbit?"\r\n\r\nRaffles, whose ideas of a tip were elastic, admitted that he was open to\r\nreceive even the smallest coin.\r\n\r\n"All right, mum\'s the word.  Jill and I have a thing on, and we don\'t\r\nwant it spoiled by the slaveys."\r\n\r\nRaffles said that, as far as he knew, the "slaveys" were thinking about\r\nanything else than the proceedings of the two young Oliphants.\r\n"Besides," said he, "being \'olidays, there\'s only me and the cook, and a\r\nmaid--and she\'s took up with nursing Mrs Parker."\r\n\r\n"Poor old Parker!  How is she?  Pretty chippy?  Sorry she\'s laid up.\r\nAll serene, Raff.  Keep it mum, and you shall have the threepenny.\r\nJolly heavy box that--that\'s the cocoa-nuts."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'re going to have a feast, are you?" said Raffles.\r\n\r\n"Getting on that way," said Tom.  "We can\'t ask you, you know, because\r\nyou\'ll have to wait.  But you shall have some of the leavings if you\r\nback us up."\r\n\r\nWith locked doors that night Tom and Jill unpacked and took stock of\r\ntheir commissariat.\r\n\r\n"Thirty-six herrings cut up in four," said Tom, with an arithmetical\r\nprecision which would have gratified Mr Armstrong, "makes 144 goes of\r\nherring.  If every man-jack turns up, that\'ll only be six goes short,\r\nand if you and I sit out of it, only four.  We might cheek in a head or\r\ntwo by accident to make that up."\r\n\r\n"Who will cook them?" asked Jill.\r\n\r\n"Oh, we can do that, I fancy, on a tray or something.  Then six cocoa-\r\nnuts into 150 will be twenty-five.  You\'ll have to cut each one into\r\ntwenty-five bits, Jill.  Then one bun apiece, and--oh, the ice!  How on\r\nearth are we to slice that up?  There\'s about a soup-plate full.\r\nCouldn\'t get strawberry, so he\'s sent coffee."\r\n\r\n"Ugh!" said Jill; "I\'ll give up my share."\r\n\r\n"I did my best," said Tom.  "It\'s not my fault strawberries are out of\r\nseason."\r\n\r\n"Of course not.  You\'re awfully clever, Tom.  What should I have done\r\nwithout you?"\r\n\r\n"Good old Jilly!  What about plates?"\r\n\r\nThe consultation lasted far into the night.\r\n\r\nNext morning the post brought a dozen or so of polite notes which sent\r\nthe hearts of the hospitable pair into their mouths.  The first they\r\nopened was from the Duke of Somewhere, who gravely "accepted with\r\npleasure Mr and Miss Oliphant\'s polite invitation."\r\n\r\nSeveral of the others were acceptances--one or two refusals.\r\n\r\n"Five scratched already," said Tom.  "That\'ll make it all right for the\r\nherrings."\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Dr Brandram called.  He carried his invitation card in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n"What game are you at now?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I say, Doctor, keep it quiet!  You\'ll come, won\'t you?  There\'ll be\r\na tidy spread--enough to go all round; and the Duke and his lot are\r\ncoming, and we expect the Grenadiers."\r\n\r\n"Doctor," said Jill, "we shall depend on you so much.  Do come early!"\r\n\r\nDr Brandram drove back to Yeld in a dazed condition of mind.  He was\r\ntempted to telegraph to the Duke and the county generally; to set a body\r\nof police to prevent any one entering the Maxfield gates; to shut the\r\ntwo miscreants up in the coal-cellar; to run away, and not return till\r\nnext week.\r\n\r\nBut after an hysterical consultation with himself, he decided that it\r\nwas too late to do anything but cast in his lot with the other victims,\r\nand go dressed in all his best to Miss Oliphant\'s "At Home," and do what\r\nhe could to steer her and her graceless brother out of their\r\npredicament.\r\n\r\nAs the fateful hour approached, Tom began to be a little nervous.  He\r\nhad not anticipated the vast number of small details demanding his\r\npersonal attention.\r\n\r\nFor instance, there was the cooking of the herrings.  Jill had nobly\r\nundertaken that task at the drawing-room fire, which was the most\r\ncapacious.  But then, if they ran it too fine, the guests might arrive\r\nwhile the fish were still fizzling on the tray.  If, on the other hand,\r\nthey were cooked too soon, they would be lukewarm by the time the guests\r\ncame to sit down to them.  Again, there were the starlights and Roman\r\ncandles to get into position outside, and arrangements had to be made\r\nfor their protection from the damp November mist.  Then, too, the\r\nfaithless Grenadiers had not turned up, which necessitated Jill\r\ndeserting her herrings and privately practising the Goblin polka, in\r\nview of possible emergencies.  Further, the table had to be laid, and\r\nevery guest\'s "go" of buns, and cocoa-nut, and coffee-ice, doled out in\r\nreadiness.  And at the last moment there arose a difficulty in raising\r\nthe requisite number of knives, forks, spoons, and plates.  Then he\r\ndiscovered that the covers were still on the drawing-room chairs and the\r\ndust-cloth on the floor, and much time and trouble was necessary for\r\ntheir removal.  Finally, he and Jill had to dress to receive their\r\nguests.\r\n\r\n"I think it will be a jolly evening," said he somewhat doubtfully, as\r\nthey hurried to their rooms.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure it will," said Jill, whose mind had not once been clouded by a\r\ndoubt.  "The herrings will be cold, that\'s the only thing.  But they may\r\nthink that\'s the newest fashion."\r\n\r\n"Look sharp and dress, anyhow," said Tom, "because you\'ve got to cut\r\nthem in fours and stick them round on the plates, and it\'s half-past six\r\nalready."\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later a grand carriage and pair drove up to the door, and\r\nRaffles solemnly announced--\r\n\r\n"His Grace the Duke of Somewhere, and the Ladies Marigold."\r\n\r\nMiss Oliphant\'s evening party had begun!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\r\n\r\nMISS JILL OLIPHANT AT HOME.\r\n\r\nWhen His Grace, who had been a good deal puzzled by his abrupt, under-\r\nstamped invitation, stepped, head in air, into the drawing-room, he was\r\nsomewhat taken aback to discover neither the captain nor his charming\r\nelder daughter, but instead, to be greeted by a little girl, nervously\r\nput forward by a small boy, and saying--\r\n\r\n"Oh, duke, _do_ you mind coming?  I hope you\'ll enjoy the party so much.\r\nThere\'ll be some dancing presently, and supper as soon as all the\r\nothers come."\r\n\r\n"You\'re the first," said Tom.  "Never mind, the others won\'t be long.\r\nLike to read the newspaper, or take a turn round?"\r\n\r\nMentally he was calculating how he should manage to squeeze in the\r\nduke\'s two daughters, who hadn\'t been invited, at his hospitable board.\r\n\r\nThe duke smiled affably.\r\n\r\n"We are rather early, but Miss Rosalind will excuse--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, she\'s away--so is father.  This is my party and Tom\'s.  Oh, duke,\r\ndo try and like it!" said Jill, taking the great man\'s hand.\r\n\r\nThe duke cast a scared look over his shoulder at his daughters, who were\r\nstaring in a somewhat awestruck manner at their two small hosts.\r\n\r\n"If the girls would like to begin dancing," suggested Tom, "Jill can\r\nplay her piece now, and you can take one, and I\'ll take the other.\r\nIt\'ll keep the things going, you know, till the rest turn up."\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Dr Brandram was announced, greatly to Tom\'s delight,\r\nwho, among so many strangers, was beginning to feel a little shy.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right," said he.  "Good old Brandy! you lead off with one of\r\nthe Marigold girls, while I stop here and do the how-d\'ye-do\'s."\r\n\r\nThe doctor, with a serious face, led His Grace aside.\r\n\r\n"This appears to be a freak of the two young people," said he.  "They\r\nare the only members of the family at home.  I am very sorry you have\r\nbeen victimised."\r\n\r\n"Tut, tut," said the duke, recovering his good-humour rapidly, "I don\'t\r\nmean to be a victim at all.  I mean to enjoy myself; so do you, doctor.\r\nGirls," said he to his daughters, "you must see the youngsters through\r\nthis.  Ha, ha! what is the rising generation coming to, to be sure."\r\n\r\nArrivals now began to drop in smartly, and as Tom looked round on the\r\ngradually filling drawing-room, a mild perspiration broke out on his\r\ningenious brow.\r\n\r\nJill had gallantly struck up her polka on the piano, but as no one\r\nlistened and no one danced, she gave it up and returned to the support\r\nof her brother.\r\n\r\n"It\'s going splendidly," said Tom in a stage whisper; "they all seem to\r\nbe enjoying it."\r\n\r\nThey certainly were--for as each gradually took in the situation, and\r\nreceived his cue from his neighbour, an unwonted air of humour permeated\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nA few hoity-toity persons of course felt outraged, and would have\r\nordered their carriages had there been any one to order them from.  The\r\nhonest Raffles was, to tell the truth, secretly busy, on a signal from\r\nTom, preparing for the banquet in the dining-room, and no other servant\r\nwas to be seen.\r\n\r\n"My dear," said Mrs Pottinger, in a severely audible voice to her\r\nhusband, "I wish to return home.  Will you get our carriage?  My ideas\r\nof amusement do not correspond with those of the young people."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t go yet!" said Tom, with beaming face, for he had caught sight\r\nof Raffles\' powdered wig at the door; "there\'s some grub ready in the\r\nnext room.  It would have been ready before, only the herrings--"\r\n\r\n"Tom," said Jill, "there\'s the Bishop just come.  He couldn\'t come for\r\nRoger\'s birthday, you know."\r\n\r\n"How do you do, Bishop?" said Tom, grasping the new arrival by the hand.\r\n"Jolly you could come this time.  I was just saying there\'s some grub\r\nin the next room.  Jill, Raff had better ring up on the gong, tell him."\r\n\r\nRaffles accordingly sounded an alarm on the gong, which brought the\r\ncompany to attention.\r\n\r\n"Supper!" cried Tom encouragingly, and led the way, allowing the company\r\ngenerally to sort themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Duke behaved nobly that night.  He gallantly gave his arm to Jill,\r\nand asked the Bishop to bring in one of his daughters.  This saved Miss\r\nOliphant\'s party from the collapse which threatened it.  Every one took\r\nthe cue from the great people.  Even Mrs Pottinger accepted the arm of\r\nthe curate, and the ardent youths, who had all arrived under the\r\ndelusion that Miss Rosalind was the hostess, forgot their\r\ndisappointment, and vowed to see the youngsters through with it.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Duke!" said Jill, hanging affectionately on her noble escort\'s arm,\r\n"are you liking it?  Do try and like it!  It\'s Tom\'s and my first party,\r\nand we want it to be a jolly one."\r\n\r\n"I never enjoyed a party half so much," said His Grace.\r\n\r\nJill thought him at that moment almost as nice as dear Mr Armstrong.\r\n\r\n"Jill," said Tom, waylaying his sister at the door, "we might have cut\r\nthe herrings in three after all.  Never mind, some of them will be able\r\nto have two goes.  I\'ll see you do.  Good old Jilly.  Isn\'t it going off\r\nprime?  And you know, the fireworks are still to come!"\r\n\r\nIt was too severe a strain on the gravity of some of the guests when\r\nthey beheld each his "go" of lukewarm herring, cocoa-nut, coffee-ice,\r\nand penny bun, with a single plate to accommodate the whole, on the\r\nboard before him.  But the laughter, if it reached the ears of the\r\ngenial host and hostess, was taken by them as a symptom of delight, in\r\nwhich they heartily shared.\r\n\r\nTom, as he cast his eye down the festive board--object of so much\r\nsolicitude and physical exertion--never felt happier in his life.  More\r\nthan half of the company would be able to get a second helping of fish\r\nand bun!\r\n\r\n"Wire in," said he to his guests generally, and to the younger Lady\r\nMarigold, his next neighbour, in particular, "before it gets cold.\r\nAwfully sorry the cocoa-nut milk wasn\'t enough to go round, so Jill and\r\nI thought--"\r\n\r\nHere a guilty look from Jill pulled him up.  Dear old Jilly, he wouldn\'t\r\nlet out on her for worlds.\r\n\r\nA good many eyes turned curiously to where the Duke sat with his "go"\r\nbefore him.  Those who were quick at observing details noticed that he\r\nhad ranged his cocoa-nut and ice on the edge of his plate, and was\r\nbeginning to attack his herring with every sign of relish.  His portion\r\nconsisted mostly of hard roe, for which he had no natural predilection,\r\nbut this evening he seemed to enjoy it, helping it down with occasional\r\nbites at the bun, and keeping up a cheerful conversation the while.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop, too, who had a tail, was making a capital meal, as were also\r\nseveral other of the guests near him.\r\n\r\n"Capital fish!" said the Duke presently.  Then beckoning to Raffles,\r\n"Can you get me a little more?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, your grace."\r\n\r\nTom felt a little anxious lest Raffles should select from out of the\r\nsurplus "goes" one of those with the heads which were to eke out in a\r\nlast emergency.  But when he saw that the duke\'s second helping\r\nconsisted of a prime "waist" he rejoiced with all his heart.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it nice?" asked Jill, who had been busily at work under the\r\nshadow of his ducal wing.\r\n\r\n"My dear little lady, I never tasted such a meal in my life."\r\n\r\nIn due time the cocoa-nut and coffee-ice were attacked with quite as\r\nmuch relish as the first course; after which Tom, looking a little warm,\r\nrose and made a little speech.\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'ve all liked it," said he.  "I was afraid there wouldn\'t be\r\nenough, but some of them didn\'t turn up, so it was all right after all.\r\nJill--that\'s my young sister here--cut the `goes\' up, and I don\'t know\r\nanybody more fair all round than her.  She and I are awfully glad you\r\ncame, and hope you\'ll have a good old time.  Please don\'t tell the\r\ngovernor or Rosalind we gave this party.  I beg to propose the health of\r\nmy young sister--good old Jilly.  She\'s a regular brick, and has backed\r\nup no end in this do.  No heel-taps!"\r\n\r\nA good many healths had been drunk in the county during the year, but\r\nfew of them were more genuinely responded to than this.  And no queen\r\never bore her honours more delightfully than the little heroine of the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n"I suppose we\'d better cut into the next room now," suggested Tom, when\r\nthis function was over.  "There\'ll be some fireworks by and by; but any\r\none who likes a hop meanwhile can have one.  Jill knows a ripping piece\r\nto play."\r\n\r\nThe invitation was cordially responded to, and when, after sundry\r\nrepetitions of the "ripping" piece, the eldest Miss Marigold offered to\r\nplay a waltz, and after her Miss Shafto relieved duty with a polka, and\r\nafter her one of the ardent youths actually condescended to perform a\r\nset of quadrilles, in which His Grace the Duke, with Jill as his\r\npartner, led off _vis-a-vis_ with the Bishop and the sister of the\r\nmember for the county, there was no room to doubt the glorious success\r\nof Miss Oliphant\'s party.\r\n\r\nTom meanwhile, joyous at heart, warm in temperature, and excited in\r\nmind, was groping on his knees on the damp grass outside the drawing-\r\nroom window, fixing his two threepenny Roman candles in reversed flower\r\npots, and planting his starlights, crackers, and Catherine-wheels in\r\nadvantageous positions in the vicinity, casting now and again a\r\ndelighted glance at the animated scene within, and wondering if he had\r\never spent a jollier evening anywhere.\r\n\r\nIt disturbed him to hear a vehicle rattle up the drive, and to argue\r\ntherefrom that some belated guest had missed the feast.  Never mind; he\r\nshouldn\'t be quite out of it.\r\n\r\n"Raffles," called he, as he caught sight of that hardworking functionary\r\nthrough the dining-room window removing the _debris_ of the banquet,\r\n"leave a few `goes\' out on the table for any chaps who come late, and\r\nthen go and tell Jill I\'m ready, and turn down the gas in the drawing-\r\nroom."\r\n\r\nIn due time Raffles delivered his momentous message.\r\n\r\n"Oh, the fireworks!" cried Miss Jill, clapping her hands, "the fireworks\r\nare to begin.  Aren\'t you glad, duke?  Do get a good seat before the gas\r\nis turned down."\r\n\r\nThe company crowded into the big bay-window, and endured the extinction\r\nof the light with great good-humour.  Indeed, a certain gentleman who\r\nentered the room at this particular juncture, seeing nothing, but\r\nhearing the laughter and talk, said to himself that this was as merry an\r\noccasion as it had been his lot to participate in.\r\n\r\nThe dim form of Tom might be seen hovering without, armed with a bull\'s-\r\neye lantern, at which he diligently kindling matches, which refused to\r\nstay in long enough to ignite the refractory fireworks.\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said he to himself, "they\'ll like it when they do go off."\r\n\r\nSo they did.  After a quarter of an hour\'s waiting one of the Roman\r\ncandles went off with vast _eclat_, and after it two crackers\r\nsimultaneously gave chase to the operator half-way round the lawn.  One\r\nof the Catherine-wheels was also prevailed upon to give a few languid\r\nrotations on its axis, and some of the squibs, which had unfortunately\r\ngot damp, condescended, after being inserted bodily into the lantern, to\r\ngo off.  Presently, however, the wind got into the lantern, and the\r\nmatches being by this time exhausted, and the starlights refusing to\r\ndepart from their usual abhorrence for spontaneous combustion, the\r\njudicious Tom deemed it prudent to pronounce this part of the\r\nentertainment at an end.\r\n\r\n"All over!" he shouted through the window.  "Turn up the light."\r\n\r\nWhen, after the applause which greeted this imposing display, the gas\r\nwas turned up, the first sight which met Miss Jill\'s eyes was the form\r\nof Mr Robert Ratman, in travelling costume, nodding familiarly across\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nAt the sight the little lady\'s face blanched, and the joy of the evening\r\nvanished like smoke.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Duke!" she exclaimed, clinging to her guest\'s arm, "do please turn\r\nthat wicked man there out of the house.  We didn\'t invite him, and he\'s\r\nno right, really.  If dear Mr Armstrong was only here!  Please put him\r\nout."\r\n\r\nThe duke looked a little blank at this appeal.\r\n\r\n"Why, child, really?  Who is he?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"A wicked, bad man, that I hate; and I did think you would be kind\r\nenough to--"\r\n\r\n"What is his name?"\r\n\r\n"Mr Ratman; he hurt me awfully once."\r\n\r\nThe duke, feeling that Miss Oliphant\'s party was taking rather a serious\r\nturn, walked across the room to where Mr Ratman was already engaged in\r\nan uncomfortable colloquy with Dr Brandram.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing here?" the doctor had asked.\r\n\r\n"That\'s my business," said Mr Ratman.  "For the matter of that, what\r\nare you doing here?"\r\n\r\n"Among other things, I am here to see that the young people of the house\r\nare not annoyed by the intrusion of a person called Ratman."\r\n\r\n"And I," said the duke, coming up, "am here to advise you to save\r\ntrouble by leaving the house."\r\n\r\n"And who are you, sir?"\r\n\r\n"I am the Duke of Somewhere."\r\n\r\n"Proud to renew my acquaintance, sir.  May I ask if you have quite\r\nforgotten me?"\r\n\r\n"Sir, you have the advantage of me.  I never saw you before."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, my lord, you saw me a month ago, at a birthday party in this\r\nvery house."\r\n\r\n"If so, I was not sufficiently impressed sir, to remember you now.  I\r\nrepeat my request as the friend of the young lady."\r\n\r\n"Ah, indeed!" said Ratman; "I am not aware, your grace, of your right to\r\nspeak to me in the name of Miss Oliphant, or anybody else."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Tom, arriving on the scene at this juncture, "you there,\r\nRatty? you\'d better clear out.  All the grub\'s done, and you\'re not\r\nwanted here.  We didn\'t ask you--took care not to.  Rosalind\'s not here.\r\nThis is Jilly\'s and my party.  Isn\'t it, you chaps?"  The chaps\r\nappealed to, His Grace, the doctor, and one or two of the other guests,\r\ncorroborated this statement.\r\n\r\nMr Ratman leant comfortably against the wall.\r\n\r\n"Flattering reception," said he.  "I am inclined to take your lordship\'s\r\nadvice and go; but before I do, may I ask your lordship again if you\r\nreally do not remember me?"\r\n\r\n"I never saw you before, sir," said His Grace; "and allow me to add, I\r\nhave no desire to see you again."\r\n\r\n"_Dear_ Duke!" whispered Jill encouragingly, putting her hand in his.\r\n\r\n"Odd the changes a few years make," rejoined Mr Ratman.  "I presume\r\nyour lordship\'s memory can carry you back a little time--say twenty\r\nyears?"\r\n\r\n"What of that, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Merely that if that is so, you probably can remember a lad named Roger\r\nIngleton who lived in this house, son of the old Squire."\r\n\r\nThere was a dead silence now, and the Duke looked in a startled way at\r\nthe speaker.\r\n\r\n"I see you remember that boy," said the intruder; "and you probably\r\nheard the story of my--I mean his quarrel with his father, and also\r\nheard of his supposed death.  Now, your grace, put twenty years on to\r\nthat boy, and suppose the story of his death was a myth, then say again\r\nyou don\'t remember me."\r\n\r\n"What, you mean to say _you_ are young Roger Ingleton?"\r\n\r\n"At your grace\'s service."\r\n\r\nTom gave a whistle, half dismay, half amusement.  The doctor smiled\r\ncontemptuously.  The duke bit his lip and gazed stolidly at the speaker.\r\n\r\n"You are not obliged to believe me," said the latter jauntily; "only you\r\nwanted to know my business in Maxfield, and I have told you.  I don\'t\r\nsay I\'m the heir, for I understand my father was good enough to cut me\r\nout of every penny of his estate.  And as for being a paragon of virtue,\r\nor the opposite, that\'s my affair and no one else\'s--eh, your grace?"\r\n\r\nHis Grace was much disturbed.  He had once seen young Roger Ingleton, at\r\nthat time a mere boy, but retained no distinct memory of him.  At the\r\ntime of the quarrel between father and son he had been abroad, and the\r\nnews of the lad\'s death had been formally communicated as a matter\r\nbeyond question.  Recognition, as far as he was concerned, was\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n"You choose a strange time, sir," said he, "for coming here with this\r\nstory, when the heir and his guardians are both away."\r\n\r\n"I supposed my brother was here," said Ratman.  "In any case he knows\r\nwho I am; so does your friend the tutor, Dr Brandram."\r\n\r\n"Oh, why _do_ you stop talking to that hateful man instead of coming,\r\nand enjoying the party?" pleaded Jill.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my little lady, is that you?" said Ratman advancing.\r\n\r\nBut his passage was intercepted by the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Gently, my friend," said he.  "Now that you have relieved yourself of\r\nyour pretty story, let me suggest that the easiest way out of this house\r\nis by the door."\r\n\r\n"Who are you, sir?" blustered Ratman.\r\n\r\nDr Brandram laughed.\r\n\r\n"I must have changed in twenty years as much as you," said he.\r\n\r\n"I am not going to ask _your_ leave to be in my father\'s house."\r\n\r\n"I am not going to ask your leave to put you out of it."\r\n\r\nTom\'s spirits rose.  There seemed every promise of an unrehearsed\r\nentertainment for the delectation of his guests.\r\n\r\n"I caution you, sir."\r\n\r\n"I will take all responsibility," said the doctor.  "Anything more you\r\nhave to say can just as well be said in Mr Pottinger\'s office to-morrow\r\nmorning as here."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir," said Mr Ratman, with a snarl.  "It is never pleasant\r\nto have to introduce oneself, but I am glad to have had the opportunity\r\nbefore this distinguished company.  It is now the turn of the other side\r\nto move.  If they want me they must find me.  Good night, your grace;\r\nyou are a nice loyal neighbour to an old comrade\'s boy.  Good night,\r\nyou, sir; take as much responsibility as you like if it is any\r\nsatisfaction to you.  Good-bye, my pretty little Jill; some day you\'ll\r\nhave to call me cousin Roger, and then we\'ll be quits.  Good night,\r\ngentlemen and ladies all.  The prodigal\'s return has not been a success,\r\nI own, but it\'s a fact all the same.  _Au revoir_."\r\n\r\nAnd he bowed himself out.\r\n\r\n"This fellow is either the most impudent villain I ever met," said the\r\nDuke, "or there is something in his story."\r\n\r\nThis seemed to be the general impression.  A few, Dr Brandram among\r\nthem, scoffed irreverently at the whole affair.  But the majority of\r\nthose present felt decidedly disturbed by the incident, and poor Miss\r\nJill Oliphant had the mortification of seeing her party drop flat after\r\nall.\r\n\r\nTom and she made Herculean efforts to rehabilitate it.  Jill played her\r\npolka till she was tired, and Tom, after setting out all the duplicate\r\n"goes" in the hall, retired to grope in the wet grass for a few of the\r\nunexploded squibs.\r\n\r\nSome of the guests did what they could to back their hosts up, and made\r\ngreat show of enjoying themselves, but the Duke was preoccupied, and the\r\nBishop was pensive.  The Marigold girls talked in a corner, and Mr\r\nPottinger was out in the hall calling for his carriage.\r\n\r\n"Odious man!" said the poor little hostess, "he\'s spoiled all our fun.\r\nNo one likes our party now.  They\'ll all be glad to get away; and we did\r\ntry so hard to make it jolly."\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said Tom cheerfully, "it would have been worse if he had\r\nturned up before the grub and the fireworks.  They didn\'t miss them.\r\nKeep it up, Jilly, I say; it\'s going off all right."\r\n\r\nWhen it came to saying good night, every one remembered their genial\r\nentertainers, and Jill was a little consoled by the assurances she\r\nreceived on all hands that the evening had been a delightful one.\r\n\r\n"Try to think it was nice," said she, "and don\'t go saying it was horrid\r\nas soon as you get outside.  It\'s Tom\'s and my first party, you know."\r\n\r\nAnd she kissed all the gentlemen, from the Duke downward, and Tom,\r\nhovering in the hall, pressed his farewell refreshments, as far as they\r\nwould go, upon them and gave them a "leg up" into their carriages.\r\n\r\nDr Brandram stayed till the end.\r\n\r\n"I should have to come and see Mrs Parker in the morning in any case,"\r\nsaid he, "so I have told Raffles to make me a shake down in Armstrong\'s\r\nroom to-night.  I may as well stay here."\r\n\r\nThe precaution, however, was unnecessary.  Mr Ratman had vanished.  He\r\ndid not call on Mr Pottinger next morning, nor was he to be found at\r\nthe hotel.  He had returned by the early morning train to London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\r\n\r\nA FEEBLE CLUE.\r\n\r\nMr Fastnet\'s lodgings were a good deal less imposing than Roger, who\r\nhad hitherto only met the owner at the club, had pictured to himself.\r\nIn fact, the small sitting-room, with bedroom to match, commonly\r\nfurnished, reeking of tobacco, and hung all round with sporting and\r\ndramatic prints, was quite as likely a refuge for an unfledged medical\r\nstudent as for a person of the swagger and presence of Mr Felix\r\nFastnet.\r\n\r\n"No use to me," he explained, interpreting his young guest\'s thought,\r\n"except as a dog-kennel.  I live at the club--breakfast, lunch, dinner--\r\neverything; but I was so disgusted with the performance of that young\r\ncad to-night that I even prefer the dog-kennel.  Have a soda?"\r\n\r\nRoger accepted, and sat down by the fire.\r\n\r\n"Yes," growled on his host; "I\'m father of that club, and I don\'t like\r\nto see it degraded.  If he\'d gone for you, and kicked you into the\r\nstreet, I shouldn\'t have lifted a finger to stop him.  He could have\r\nmade hay of you if I\'d chosen, a sickly youngster like you."\r\n\r\n"I wonder he did not," said Roger; "but, Mr Fastnet, now I have met\r\nyou, I want to ask you a question."\r\n\r\n"Ask away."\r\n\r\n"My name, as you know, is Roger Ingleton.  Have you never met any one of\r\nmy name before?"\r\n\r\n"Bless me, no.  Why should I?"\r\n\r\n"I had a namesake once who came to London, and I wondered if you\r\npossibly knew him."\r\n\r\n"My dear sir, I don\'t know quite all the young men who have come to\r\nLondon during the last twenty years.  What makes you think it?"\r\n\r\n"My namesake was a brother--son of my father\'s first wife.  He left home\r\nand disappeared.  Rumour says he went to London, where he was last heard\r\nof in company of a companion named Fastnet."\r\n\r\nMr Fastnet put down his glass.\r\n\r\n"Eh?" said he.  "The Fastnets are not a big clan.  Are you sure that was\r\nthe name?"\r\n\r\n"It was certainly the name that reached me."\r\n\r\n"Must refer to some one else then.  I never knew or heard of any one of\r\nthe name of Ingleton in my life."\r\n\r\nRoger\'s countenance fell.  The new scent appeared likely to be a false\r\none after all.\r\n\r\n"How long ago is all this?" asked his host.\r\n\r\n"More than twenty years.  My brother left home in a pique, and, I\'m\r\nafraid, went to the bad in--"\r\n\r\n"Twenty years?" said Mr Fastnet, putting down his cigar beside the\r\nglass.  "What sort of fellow was he?  A harum-scarum young dog, with\r\nimpudent eyes, and a toss of his head that would have defied the bench\r\nof bishops?"\r\n\r\n"That is he," said Roger excitedly.\r\n\r\n"Sit down!" continued Fastnet--"curly hair, arms like a young Hercules,\r\nas obstinate as a bulldog, with a temper like a tiger?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes! that must be the same."\r\n\r\n"Left his mother and father in a furious tantrum, with a vow to cut off\r\nhis head before he showed face at home again?  A regular young demon, as\r\nhonest as the Bank of England--no taste for vice in any shape or form,\r\nbut plunged into it just to spite his friends, civil enough when you got\r\nhim on the weather side, and no fool?  Was that the fellow?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure you describe the very man," said Roger.\r\n\r\n"Man?  He was a boy; a raw-boned green boy, smarting under a sense of\r\ninjustice, a regular, thorough-paced young Ishmaelite as you ever saw.\r\nI should fancy I did know him.  But his name was not Ingleton."\r\n\r\n"What was it?"\r\n\r\n"Jack Rogers."\r\n\r\n"No doubt he adopted his own Christian name as a disguise."\r\n\r\n"Very likely.  I could never get him to talk about his people.  His one\r\nobject was to lose himself--body and soul--it seemed to me.  Bless you,\r\nI had little enough voice in his proceedings.  I was wild enough, but I\r\npromise you I was a milksop to him.  Neck or nothing was his motto, and\r\nhe lived up to it.  The one drawback to success in his particular line\r\nwas that he would insist on being a gentleman.  Fatal complaint to any\r\none who wants to go to the bad."\r\n\r\n"Have you any idea what became of my brother?"\r\n\r\n"Not in the least.  He knocked about with me for about a year, till he\r\nsuddenly discovered he was living on me.  Not that I minded; I had pots\r\nof money--it\'s been my curse.  Never had to do a day\'s work in my life.\r\nHe pulled up short at that, pawned his watch, and refused to take\r\nanother crust of bread, and left me without a penny in his pocket.  I\r\nonly heard once of him afterwards.  He wrote to enclose a five-pound\r\nnote."\r\n\r\n"Have you got his letter?  Can you remember where he wrote from?" asked\r\nRoger excitedly.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe there was a letter.  The note was wrapped up in an old\r\nplay-bill of some strolling company of actors.  I remember it now,"\r\nadded Fastnet, laughing and re-lighting his cigar.  "Yes, it was\r\n_Hamlet_.  Rogers was cast for the ghost in one act, Polonius in\r\nanother, and the grave-digger in another.  I remember how I roared when\r\nI read it.  Fancy that fellow as Polonius!"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you remember the town?"\r\n\r\n"Not a ghost of an idea.  Some little village in the Midlands probably,\r\nwhere _Hamlet_ would be appreciated.  I remember, by the way, the bill--\r\npity I didn\'t keep it--mentioned that this enterprising company was\r\ngoing to give a performance in Boulogne, of all places.  It occurred to\r\nme it would be a source of great consolation to our fellow-countrymen in\r\nthat dismal colony to witness Jack Rogers in the ghost for one night\r\nonly."\r\n\r\n"That would be eighteen or nineteen years ago," said Roger, with a sigh\r\nat the hopelessness of his quest.  "You have heard nothing since?"\r\n\r\n"Not a syllable.  Have some more sherry?"\r\n\r\nRoger reached his hotel that night in more than mental distress.  The\r\nfatigue and anxiety of the last few days had had their inevitable result\r\non his health, and though the penalty had been postponed, it was coming\r\nto account at last.\r\n\r\nWhen his worthy guardian returned on the following day, he was much\r\nshocked to find his ward really ill.  He did his best.  He tried to\r\ninduce the patient to make an effort to "shake off" his ailments.  He\r\nsat up late in his room at night, talking and attempting to amuse him.\r\nHe even purchased a few amateur specifics; and finally, when the boy was\r\nas ill as ill could be, called in a pettifogging practitioner, who might\r\nbe trusted to bungle the case.\r\n\r\n"Regular bad case," said that learned gentleman, after the third or\r\nfourth visit.  "May last a week with care."\r\n\r\nThe good captain naturally grew concerned.  Matters seemed to be\r\nprogressing beyond even his expectations.  The practitioner\'s verdict\r\nspeedily got wind in the hotel.  Visitors came anxiously to inquire\r\nafter the young gentleman\'s condition, and urged a second opinion.  And\r\none or two were inconsiderate enough to suggest that the patient was not\r\nhaving fair play.\r\n\r\nUnder these distressing circumstances, Captain Oliphant decided to write\r\na line to Dr Brandram.\r\n\r\n"Roger has unfortunately taken a chill.  Will you kindly forward me the\r\nprescription which benefited him so much last summer, as I am naturally\r\nanxious to omit no precaution for the dear fellow\'s good.  He is being\r\nwell cared for, and will, I trust, be all right in a day or two."\r\n\r\nDr Brandram\'s reply to this transparent communication was to order his\r\ndogcart and take the first train to London.  Before starting, he had\r\ntime to send a telegram to Armstrong to meet him at the hotel the same\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nLittle dreaming of the effect of his message, Captain Oliphant was\r\nspending a resigned afternoon in the sick-room.  Fate was working on his\r\nside once more.  Mr Ratman had apparently vanished into space.  Mr\r\nArmstrong was out of the way.  The practitioner\'s face had been longer\r\nthan ever when he took his leave a few hours ago.  The difficulties and\r\ndisappointments of the past few months were giving way to better\r\nprospects.  The good man\'s conscience accused him of no actual injury to\r\nhis ward.  On the contrary, he could honestly say he had devoted time,\r\nmoney, personal fatigue, to tending him.  He had secured him medical\r\nattendance, he had advised the family doctor of his indisposition.  He\r\nhad sat up with him day and night.  Was it his fault if the illness took\r\na bad turn, and the Maxfield property changed its owner?  He should like\r\nto meet the man who could lay anything at his door.\r\n\r\nRoger turned on his pillow and began to wander--\r\n\r\n"Tell him I believe it.  I\'ll go and find the grave-digger.  Ask\r\nFastnet, and Compton, and all of them.  No more sherry, thanks.  Yes,\r\nsir, I said you were no gentleman.  I repeat it.  You have no right to\r\nmention her name.  Shut the door, Rosalind.  There\'s only eleven months\r\nto do it in.  He is waiting at the General Post Office.  Armstrong has\r\ngone away.  They expelled him from the club."\r\n\r\n"Poor fellow," sighed the captain, as he smoothed the sufferer\'s pillow;\r\n"poor fellow!  How absurdly he talks."\r\n\r\nSo engrossed was he in his ministrations that he failed to perceive the\r\ndoor behind him softly open and a gentleman enter.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong had outstripped the doctor in the race to town.  Without a\r\nword the tutor walked to the bed and bent over the troubled form of his\r\npupil.  Then with face almost as white as that of his enemy, he turned.\r\n\r\n"What brings you here?" gasped the captain.\r\n\r\n"How long has he been like this?" demanded the tutor.\r\n\r\n"Do you hear my question?"\r\n\r\n"Do you hear mine?"\r\n\r\nThe weaker man capitulated, with a malediction, to the stronger.\r\n\r\n"Since yesterday.  He is being carefully tended."\r\n\r\n"By whom--you alone?"\r\n\r\n"By a doctor."\r\n\r\n"What doctor?"\r\n\r\n"When I know your right to catechise me, I will answer," snarled the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong rang the bell.\r\n\r\n"Light the fire here at once," said he to the maid, "and then send the\r\nmessenger up."\r\n\r\nIn the interval the two men stood eyeing one another, while the patient\r\nfrom time to time tossed on his pillow and muttered to himself.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong hurriedly scrawled two notes.\r\n\r\n"Take a cab, and leave this note at --- Hospital.  Let the nurse I have\r\nasked for come back in the cab at once.  Then go on with this note to\r\nSir William Dove, and bring word from him the earliest moment he can be\r\nhere.  Don\'t lose an instant."\r\n\r\n"Captain Oliphant," said he, as soon as the messenger had gone, "three\r\nis too many for this room.  I am here to relieve guard.  You need rest.\r\nDr Brandram will be here any moment.  Bring him up directly he comes."\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant was certainly deserving of a little sympathy.  He had\r\nborne the burden and heat of the day, and now another was entering into\r\nhis labour.  But the tutor\'s tone had an ugly ring about it, which, for\r\nthe moment, cowed the injured gentleman, and constrained him, after\r\nglowering for a moment or two, and trying to articulate a protest,\r\nmeekly to withdraw.\r\n\r\n"My responsibility ends where yours begins," said he, with his best\r\nsneer.  "I grudge none of the trouble I have taken for the dear boy, but\r\nI must decline to remain here as the assistant of Signor Francisco the\r\nmusic-hall cad."\r\n\r\n"I can imagine it might be painful," said Mr Armstrong drily; "but the\r\nimmediate thing to be desired is that you should not consume the oxygen\r\nin this room.  Explanations will do later."\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant was not at hand that evening to meet the doctors.  A\r\nbusiness engagement had summoned him to Maxfield, where he rejoiced the\r\nhearts of his two children by a sudden arrival at breakfast-time.\r\n\r\nA curt note from Armstrong the same afternoon apprised him that his\r\nmovements had been anticipated.\r\n\r\n"Doctors not without hope.  Admirable nurse secured.  Brandram and I\r\nremain here."\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant derived scant consolation from this announcement, and\r\nquite forgot his business engagement in his mortification and ill\r\ntemper.  He dropped in during the day to see Mr Pottinger, to discuss\r\nhis grievance with that legal luminary.  But Mr Pottinger, as the\r\nreader is aware, had complications of another kind to disclose.  He\r\nastonished his visitor with an account of the surprise visit of Mr\r\nRatman a few days previously, and of that gentleman\'s astounding claims\r\nto the name of Ingleton.\r\n\r\n"What!" exclaimed the captain, "you mean to say that scoundrel actually\r\nclaimed to be the lost son?  I always had a high opinion of his\r\nimpudence, but I never imagined it capable of that.  Why, my dear sir, I\r\nhave known him as a pettifogging money-lender in India for years."\r\n\r\n"Quite so; but did you know why and when he came to India?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say I did.  Surely you don\'t credit his story?"\r\n\r\n"Well, not exactly.  But it strikes me the gentleman will give us some\r\ndifficulty."\r\n\r\n"Why?  What good can it do him even if he is what he claims!  He cannot\r\nupset the will, which emphatically cuts him out of every possibility of\r\nbenefit."\r\n\r\n"No; that leaves him no loophole, certainly.  But he may calculate on\r\nworking on the chivalry of his younger brother, or if that fails, on\r\nblackmailing him."\r\n\r\n"If so, he will have us to deal with.  For once in a way Armstrong and I\r\nare likely to be of the same opinion.  Surely there is evidence enough\r\nto prosecute for conspiracy."\r\n\r\n"Hardly.  He claims nothing but the name.  He admits he has no rights.\r\nMy opinion, Captain Oliphant, is that we have not heard the end of him."\r\n\r\n"Very likely not, especially as I unluckily owe him money."\r\n\r\n"That is awkward.  The sooner you square accounts and get rid of him the\r\nbetter."\r\n\r\n"Easier said than done," remarked the captain, and returned with a\r\ndecided headache to Maxfield.\r\n\r\nRoger, with Armstrong to nurse him, with Dr Brandram to attend him,\r\nwith his own strong bias towards life to buoy him up, emerged slowly\r\nfrom the valley of the shadow of death, and in due time stood once more\r\non his feet.  Weeks before that happened he had told and heard all that\r\nwas to be said about his lost brother.  Dr Brandram had recounted the\r\nincident at Miss Jill\'s party, and he in turn had confided to his tutor\r\nhis meeting with Fastnet, and the feeble clue in which that conference\r\nhad resulted.\r\n\r\n"Armstrong, old fellow," said he one day at the close of the year,\r\n"won\'t you help me in this?  I know you hate the business, and think me\r\na fool for my pains.  I must do it, with you or without you, and would\r\nsooner do it with you.  In ten months it will be too late."\r\n\r\n"I hate the business, as you say, but you may count on me; only don\'t\r\nask me to hail Mr Ratman as Squire of Maxfield, or subscribe a penny to\r\nhis maintenance, a day before his claim is proved."\r\n\r\n"You are a brick; I was a cad ever to doubt it.  Let us start next week\r\nfor Boulogne."\r\n\r\n"Quite so," said the tutor, screwing his glass viciously into his eye;\r\n"let us go to Boulogne by all means."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\r\n\r\nTHE GHOST OF HAMLET.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to conceive of a more hopeful task than hunting up and\r\ndown a large French town for tidings of a strolling player who, for one\r\nnight only, played the ghost in _Hamlet_ twenty years ago.  But Roger,\r\nas, early in the year, he stepped ashore at Boulogne with Armstrong at\r\nhis side, felt sanguine and of good cheer.\r\n\r\nHis recovery had been slow, and not without interruption.  As soon as he\r\ncould be moved he had returned to Maxfield, only to find Rosalind still\r\naway, and his guardian obdurate to any suggestion for expediting her\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nAs to the proposed journey to Boulogne, the gallant captain looked upon\r\nthat as a symptom of serious mental exhaustion on the part of the\r\ninvalid.  Roger, however, was in a mood impervious to argument.\r\n\r\nWhen the time actually came, the captain surprised every one by giving\r\nin more readily than any one had expected.  The truth was, Mr Ratman,\r\nthough lost to sight, contrived to make himself very dear to his\r\ndebtor\'s memory, and already a legal document had reached Maxfield\r\ndemanding the payment in full of a certain bill within a certain date on\r\npain of certain consequences.  And Captain Oliphant felt it would be\r\ndistinctly convenient, for a while, to be relieved of the presence both\r\nof his co-trustee and his ward.  He felt himself quite competent to deal\r\nwith the trust moneys which were shortly about to come in without\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, Roger with some hesitation returned to the charge, he\r\nsaid, somewhat severely--\r\n\r\n"You are old enough to decide for yourself, my boy.  You know my view of\r\nthe matter.  I conclude you are not going alone?"\r\n\r\n"No; Armstrong is coming."\r\n\r\n"Naturally.  I wish you joy.  On your return I shall be happy to resume\r\nmy responsibility for your welfare.  I cannot profess to feel oppressed\r\nby it in your absence."\r\n\r\nThis was enough.  True, the captain contrived to get in a parting shot\r\nby announcing that Rosalind was likely to return shortly to Maxfield.\r\nBut even that did not suffice to change the lad\'s purpose.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be very long away," said Jill to Mr Armstrong.  "You are always\r\ngoing and leaving us.  Rosalind will be very, very sorry to find you are\r\naway.  She likes you--she told me so; but she doesn\'t like you half as\r\nmuch as I do."\r\n\r\nThe tutor flushed uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Tom, "you\'re always spoons on somebody, Jill.  I heard you\r\ntell that Duke chap you liked him better than anybody in the world."\r\n\r\n"O Tom! how dare you tell such a wicked falsehood?  I told him I liked\r\nhim _nearly_ as much as Mr Armstrong, but not quite.  Really I did, Mr\r\nArmstrong."\r\n\r\n"I am very jealous of the Duke," said Mr Armstrong gravely.\r\n\r\nOnce across the Channel, Roger\'s spirits rose.  He had a presentiment he\r\nwas on the right track.  Like a knight of old, set down to a desperate\r\ntask, the fighting blood rose joyously within him.  Whatever it cost,\r\nwhoever deserted him, whoever opposed him, he would find his brother,\r\nand give to him his own.\r\n\r\nFor days they went hither and thither, inquiring at cafes, theatres,\r\ncabarets, custom-houses, police stations, and even cemeteries, without\r\nsuccess.  Most of the persons accosted laughed and shrugged their\r\nshoulders to be asked if they remembered the visit of strolling players\r\nto the town as far back as twenty years.  Others bridled up\r\nsuspiciously, as if the question were a preliminary to their detection\r\nin some old evil deed.  Others utterly failed to comprehend the\r\nquestion; and a few pityingly tapped their own foreheads, and shook\r\ntheir heads at the two half-witted English holiday-makers.  But no one\r\ncould tell a word about Rogers.\r\n\r\nA fortnight passed, and the thoughts of both, dispirited and worn,\r\nturned homeward.  Rosalind, a letter had informed them, was back at\r\nMaxfield.\r\n\r\nOf the two, perhaps Mr Armstrong displayed less disposition to own\r\nhimself beaten.  He had worked like a horse all the time.  Roger had\r\nbeen compelled to own that without him his mission would have been a\r\nfeeble farce.  Not a stone did the dogged tutor leave unturned.  Not a\r\ndifficulty did he shirk.  Not a man or woman, however forbidding, did he\r\nhesitate to tackle, who in the remotest degree might be suspected of\r\nbeing likely to give information.  Now that it came to giving in, he\r\nhung back, reluctant to dip his colours.\r\n\r\n"To-day\'s Thursday," said he.  "Let\'s give ourselves till Saturday.  If\r\nnothing turns up by then, I am your man to slink home."\r\n\r\nRoger, a little ashamed to find the first last and the last first in the\r\nrace after all, readily assented.  And the two worked unflagging for two\r\ndays longer.\r\n\r\nFriday evening came, and the two sat dismally down to _table d\'hote_\r\nwith defeat staring them in the face.  They said very little, but each\r\nknew the mortification in the other\'s breast.\r\n\r\nAt last, when the meal was over, Mr Armstrong said--\r\n\r\n"I suppose we had better go and get our tickets."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so."\r\n\r\nBut the _bureau_ was closed for the night, and the two took a solitary\r\nwalk along the beach.  They walked on further than usual in the clear\r\nmoonlight, till at last the tutor looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n"It\'s nine o\'clock," said he; "we must go back."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s take the country road back."\r\n\r\n"It is a mile longer."\r\n\r\n"Never mind.  It is our last night."\r\n\r\nSo they struck up by the cliffs, and followed the chalky country road\r\nback to Boulogne.\r\n\r\nAbout two miles from the town the cheery lights of a wayside _auberge_\r\nattracted their attention.\r\n\r\n"Let us get some coffee here," said Armstrong.\r\n\r\nThis solitary tavern rejoiced in the name of "Cafe d\'Angleterre," but if\r\nits owner expected thereby to attract the custom of Mr John Bull, he\r\nwas singularly mistaken.  The chief customers of the place were\r\nlabourers and navvies, who by their noisy jargon were evidently innocent\r\nof all pretensions to a foreign tongue.\r\n\r\nSeeing two strangers, presumably able to pay ready money for what they\r\nconsumed, the old landlord invited his visitors into the bar parlour,\r\nwhere at his own table he set before them that delightful concoction of\r\nchicory and sifted earth which certain provincial Frenchmen call _cafe_.\r\nAnd being a gregarious and inquisitive old man, and withal proud of his\r\ntolerable stock of English, he took the liberty of joining them.\r\n\r\n"Inglese?" inquired he, with a pantomimic shrug.\r\n\r\n"Quite so," said the tutor, putting up his glass, and inspecting the\r\nfellow carefully.\r\n\r\n"This is the `Cafe d\'Angleterre,\'" said the landlord, "but, _helas_! it\r\nis long since the Inglese gentleman come here.  They like too well the\r\ngreat town."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Boulogne has grown.  Can you remember the place twenty years ago?"\r\n\r\n"Can I?  I can remember forty years."\r\n\r\n"I wonder," broke in Roger, too impatient to allow his tutor to lead up\r\ngradually to the inevitable question, "if you can remember some English\r\nplayers coming over here about eighteen years ago and acting a play\r\ncalled _Hamlet_ in English."\r\n\r\nThe landlord blew a cloud of smoke from his lips, and stared round at\r\nthe speaker as if he had been a ghost.\r\n\r\n"Why do you ask me that? _\'Amlet_!  Can I forget it?"\r\n\r\nHere was a bolt out of the blue!  The tutor\'s eye-glass dropped with a\r\nclatter against his cup, and Roger fetched a breath half gasp, half\r\nsigh.\r\n\r\n"You remember it!" exclaimed he, seizing the man\'s hand; "do you know,\r\nwe have been a fortnight in Boulogne trying to find some one who did!"\r\n\r\n"Would not _you_ remember it," replied the Frenchman, with a\r\ngesticulation, "if \'Amlet had put up at your inn and gone away without\r\npaying his bill?"\r\n\r\n"Did one of the actors stay here, then?"\r\n\r\n"One?  There was twenty \'Amlets, and Miladi \'Amlets, and Mademoiselle\r\n\'Amlets.  They all stay here, _en famille_.  The house is full of\r\n\'Amlets.  The stable is full.  They bring with them a castle of \'Amlet,\r\nand a grave of \'Amlet.  My poor house was all \'Amlet!"\r\n\r\n"And," inquired Mr Armstrong, flushed with the sudden discovery, but as\r\ncool as ever, "you had a pass to see the play, of course?"\r\n\r\n"_Mon dieu_! it was all the pay I got.  \'Amlet come to my house with his\r\ntwenty hungry mouth, and eat me up, flesh and bone.  He sleep in my\r\nbeds, he sleep on my roof, he sleep in my stable.  The place is\r\n\'Amlet\'s.  And all my pay is one piece of card bidding me see him play\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"And was it well played?"  Asked Mr Armstrong.\r\n\r\n"Well played?  How do I know?  But six persons came to see it--I one--\r\nand in six minutes it is all done.  Your English \'Amlet will not play to\r\nthe empty bench.  He call down the curtain, and bid us go where we\r\nplease.  Not even will he pay us back our money.  Then, when he come to\r\nleave the hall himself, _voila_, he has no money to pay his rent.  His\r\nbaggage is seized, and \'Amlet fights.  _Mon dieu_, there was _une\r\nemeute_ in Boulogne that night; and before day \'Amlet has vanish like\r\nhis own ghost, and I am a robbed man; _voila_."\r\n\r\n"Very rough on you," said the tutor.  "So there was a ghost among the\r\nplayers?"\r\n\r\n"Why no?  It would not be _\'Amlet_ without."\r\n\r\n"Did the ghost stay here too?"\r\n\r\n"_Helas_! yes.  He eat, and drink, and sleep, and forgets to pay, like\r\nthe rest."\r\n\r\n"What did you lose by him?" asked Roger, with parched lips.\r\n\r\n"Ah, monsieur, I was a Napoleon poorer for every \'Amlet in my house that\r\nnight."\r\n\r\nRoger put down two sovereigns on the table.\r\n\r\n"That is to pay for the ghost," said he, flushing.  "He was my brother."\r\n\r\nThe landlord stared in blank amazement.\r\n\r\n"Your brother!  Monsieur le Ghost of _\'Amlet_ was--_pardieu_!" exclaimed\r\nhe, looking hard at his guest, "and he was like you.  It was no fault of\r\nhis _\'Amlet_ did not take the favour, for he play in the first act and\r\nmake us all laugh.  If the other \'Amlets had been so amusing as him, the\r\nhouse would have been full--packed.  Ha! now you say it, he was a\r\ngentleman, this poor Monsieur le Ghost.  He held himself apart from the\r\nnoisy company, and sulk in a corner, while they laugh, and drink, and\r\nsing the song.  They were afraid of him, and, _mon dieu_! they might\r\nbe--for once, when Monsieur Rosencrantz, as I remember, came and threw\r\nsome absinthe--my absinthe, messieurs--in his face, Monsieur le Ghost he\r\nknocked him down with a blow that sounded--oh, like a clap of the\r\nthunder.  And this pauvre ghost," added the man, "was monsieur\'s\r\nbrother!  _Helas_! he was come down very poor--his coat was rags, and\r\nhis boots were open to the water of heaven.  He eat little.  Ah,\r\nmonsieur, I have deceived you.  He cost me not five franc; for, when I\r\nremember, he ate nothings--he starve himself."\r\n\r\n"Was he ill?" asked Armstrong.\r\n\r\n"Worse," said the landlord, lowering his voice; "he was in love.  I\r\ncould see it.  She laugh and make the mock at him, and play coquet with\r\nthe others before his face.  It nearly killed him--this pauvre ghost.\r\nHe would have give his hand for a kind glance, but he got it never."\r\n\r\n"Who was the girl?" asked Roger.\r\n\r\n"But a child, the minx--fifteen, perhaps sixteen, years, no more.  She\r\nplayed the part of a page-boy, and only so because monsieur, her father,\r\nwas manage the play.  He was Frenchman, this monsieur, but mademoiselle\r\nwas English like her mother.  _Helas_! monsieur, your brother was deep\r\nin love.  But there was no hope for him.  A fool could see that."\r\n\r\nThis was all the host could tell them.  He had never heard since of any\r\nmember of the ill-fated company.  He could introduce them to no one who\r\nremembered their visit.  A few there might be who when appealed to might\r\nhave recalled the disturbance on the night of the performance, and the\r\nabsconding of the players.  But who they were and what became of them no\r\none could say.\r\n\r\nOn their return to the hotel at Boulogne at midnight they found a\r\ntelegram and a letter awaiting them.\r\n\r\nThe former was from Dr Brandram to Mr Armstrong--\r\n\r\n  "Come at once."\r\n\r\nThe letter was a missive addressed to Roger at Maxfield from London, and\r\nforwarded back to Boulogne.  It was from Mr Fastnet.\r\n\r\n  "Dear Ingleton,--Oddly enough I stumbled yesterday across the very\r\n  piece of paper I spoke to you of.  Here it is for what it was worth."\r\n\r\nRoger eagerly opened the yellow sheet.  It announced a performance of\r\n_Hamlet_ at Folkestone by a celebrated company of stars under the\r\ndirection of a Monsieur Callot.  Among the actors was a Mr John Rogers,\r\nwho took the part of the ghost in the first act.  Further down was\r\nmentioned a Miss Callot, who acted the part of a page.  And the bill\r\nannounced that after the performance in Folkestone the company would\r\nperform for two nights only in Boulogne.  More important, however, than\r\nany other particular was a footnote that Monsieur Callot was "happy to\r\nreceive pupils for instruction in the dramatic art at his address, 2\r\nLong Street, London, W.  Terms moderate.  Singing and dancing taught by\r\nMadame Callot."\r\n\r\nHere at last seemed a clue.  The pulses of the two friends quickened as\r\nthey read and re-read the time-worn document.\r\n\r\n"The boat sails in two hours," said Mr Armstrong, "I must leave you in\r\ntown.  Brandram would not telegraph for me like this unless he meant\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it means my bro-- Ratman, has turned up again.  If so,\r\nArmstrong--"\r\n\r\n"Well?" inquired the tutor, digging his glass deep into his eye.\r\n\r\nRoger said nothing.\r\n\r\nOn the following afternoon Mr Armstrong had a pleasant game of\r\nAssociation football with Tom on the Maxfield lawn, and Miss Jill, who\r\nvolunteered as umpire, gave every point in favour of the tutor.\r\n\r\nJust about the time when he kicked his final goal, Roger Ingleton,\r\nminor, in London arrived at the dreary conclusion, after an hour\'s\r\npainful study of directories and maps, that there was no such street as\r\nLong Street, London, W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\r\n\r\nSHARKS BY LAND AND WATER.\r\n\r\nMr Brandram\'s abrupt summons to Mr Armstrong was not due to the\r\nreappearance on the scene of the mysterious Robert Ratman.  It was, in\r\nfact, at the instance of Miss Rosalind Oliphant that the doctor sent his\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\nThat young lady had returned a week ago to find everything at Maxfield\r\nawry.  Her father was gloomy, mysterious, and haggard.  The rumour of\r\nMr Ratman\'s extraordinary claims had become the common property of the\r\nvillage.  Roger and his tutor were away, no one exactly knew where or on\r\nwhat errand.\r\n\r\nOn the day following her return she walked across from the Vicarage to\r\nvisit her father.\r\n\r\nHe sat in the library, abstracted, pale, and limp.  The jaunty, Anglo-\r\nIndian veneer had for the time being dropped off, unmasking the worried\r\nexterior of a chicken-hearted man.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of his daughter he pulled himself together, and crushed in\r\nhis hand the letter which he had been reading.\r\n\r\n"Why, my child," said he, with unusual cordiality, "this is a pleasant\r\napparition.  Cruel girl, to desert us for so long.  We have hardly\r\nexisted without you, Roger and his tutor are away in France holiday-\r\nmaking, while I remain here on duty with no one to cheer me up."\r\n\r\n"Dear father," said Rosalind, kissing him, "how worried you look!  What\r\nis the matter?  Won\'t you tell me?"\r\n\r\nThe father\'s eyes dwelt for a moment on her fair earnest face--so like\r\nher mother\'s, so unlike a daughter of his--then they fell miserably.\r\n\r\n"Worried?" said he.  "Do I show it as plainly as all that?  I flattered\r\nmyself I kept it to myself."\r\n\r\n"Any one can see you are unhappy, father.  Why?"\r\n\r\n"I am in difficulties, my child, which you could not understand."\r\n\r\n"I could.  Do tell me."\r\n\r\n"The fact is," said the captain, taking up his pen and dotting the\r\nblotting-pad as he spoke, "that when on former occasions I have tried to\r\nclaim your sympathy I--well, I was not quite successful.  I do not want\r\nthe pain of a similar failure again."\r\n\r\n"I would do anything, anything to help you, if I could!"\r\n\r\nHe took her hand and held it in his.\r\n\r\n"I am in great straits," said he.  "An old Indian debt has followed me\r\nhere.  I cannot meet it, and ruin stares me in the face.  You know I am\r\na poor man; that I am living on other people--you have reminded me of\r\nthat often enough; that of all the money which passes my hands, scarcely\r\nenough to live on belongs by right to me.  You know all that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I know that we are poor.  How much do you owe?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I cannot say.  Not long ago it was some hundreds, but by this time it\r\nis nearer thousands.  Nothing grows so rapidly as a debt, my child--\r\neven," added he, with an unctuous drop of his voice, "a debt of honour."\r\n\r\n"And will not your creditor wait?"\r\n\r\n"My creditor has waited, but refuses to do so any longer.  In a month\r\nfrom now, my child, your father and those he loves best will be\r\npaupers."\r\n\r\n"Is there no way of meeting it?  None whatever?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot pay; I shrink from borrowing.  The trust funds in my charge\r\nare sacred--"\r\n\r\n"Of course!" said she, astonished that he should name them in such a\r\nconnection.  "Is there nothing else?"\r\n\r\n"My creditor is Robert Ratman--or as he calls himself, and possibly is,\r\nRoger Ingleton.  As you know, he claims to be the elder brother of our\r\nRoger, and I--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," said she; "Roger told me about that.  He is your creditor?"\r\n\r\n"He is.  I got into his clutches in India, little guessing who he was,\r\nand he is crushing me now.  There is but one way, and one only, of\r\nescaping him--and that way is, I fear, impossible, Rosalind."\r\n\r\n"What is it?" said she, with pale face, knowing what was to come.\r\n\r\n"He loves you.  As my son-in-law he would be no longer my creditor."\r\n\r\nShe drew away her hand with a shudder.\r\n\r\n"Father," said she, in a dry hard voice which startled him, "do you\r\nreally mean this?"\r\n\r\n"Is it a time for jesting?" said he.  "I ask nothing of you.  I merely\r\nstate facts.  You dislike him--there is an end of it.  Only remember we\r\nare not now dealing with Robert Ratman, but with an injured man who has\r\nnot had a fair chance.  The good in him," continued the father, deluded\r\nby the passive look on his daughter\'s face, and becoming suddenly warm\r\nin his championship of the absent creditor, "has been smothered; but for\r\naught we know it may still be there.  A wife--"\r\n\r\nShe stopped him with a peremptory motion of her hand.\r\n\r\n"Please do not say anything more.  Your debt--when does it fall due?"\r\n\r\n"In a week or ten days, my child.  Consider--"\r\n\r\nShe interrupted again.\r\n\r\n"No more, please," she said, almost imploringly.  "I will think what can\r\nbe done to help you in a week.  Good-bye, dear father."\r\n\r\nShe stooped, with face as white as marble, and touched his forehead with\r\nher cold lips.\r\n\r\n"Loyal girl," said the father, when the door had closed behind her; "she\r\nwill stand by me yet.  After all, Ratman has his good points--clever,\r\ncheerful, good man of business--"\r\n\r\nHere abruptly the soliloquy ended, and Captain Oliphant buried his face\r\nin his hands, a miserable man.\r\n\r\nTo Rosalind, as she walked rapidly across the park, there came but one\r\nthought.  Her father--how could she help him? how could she save him,\r\nnot so much from his debts as from the depths into which they were\r\nplunging him?\r\n\r\n"My poor father," said she.  "Only a man in desperate plight could think\r\nof such a remedy.  He never meant it.  He does not really suppose--no,\r\nno; he said he did not ask anything.  He told me because I asked.  Poor\r\ndarling father!"\r\n\r\nAnd with something very like a sob she hurried on to Yeld.\r\n\r\nShe went straight to Dr Brandram\'s.\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear young lady, it does one good to see you back," said he;\r\n"but bless me, how pale you look."\r\n\r\n"Do I?  I\'m quite well, thank you.  Dr Brandram," said she, "do you\r\nknow anything about this Mr Ratman?"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor stared at this abrupt inquiry.\r\n\r\n"Nothing more than you and every one else does--that he is a rank\r\nimpostor!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean that.  I mean, where is he?  I want to see him very much."\r\n\r\n"You want to see him?  He has vanished, and left no track.  Is it\r\nnothing I can help you in?"\r\n\r\n"No," said she, looking very miserable.  "I hoped you could have told me\r\nwhere to find him.  Good-bye, and thank you."\r\n\r\nShe departed, leaving the doctor sorely disturbed and bewildered.  He\r\nstood watching her slight figure till it disappeared in the Vicarage\r\ngarden, and then shrugging his shoulders, said, "Something wrong,\r\nsomewhere.  Evidently not a case for me to be trusted with.  It\'s about\r\ntime Armstrong came home."\r\n\r\nWhereupon he walked over to the post office and dispatched the telegram\r\nwhich, as the reader knows, procured Tom Oliphant the unspeakable\r\npleasure of a game of football on the following afternoon.\r\n\r\n"Well," said the tutor to his friend in the doctor\'s parlour that\r\nevening, "what\'s all this about?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I\'m not likely to know myself," said the doctor; and he\r\nnarrated the circumstances of Miss Oliphant\'s mysterious call.\r\n\r\n"Humph!" said the tutor.  "She wants to see him in his capacity of\r\nRobert Ratman, evidently, and not of Roger Ingleton, major."\r\n\r\n"So it seemed to me."\r\n\r\n"And you say she had just come from visiting her father at Maxfield?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"On the principle that two and two make four, I suppose we may conclude\r\nthat my co-trustee is on toast at present," said the tutor.\r\n\r\n"And further, that that co-trustee being somebody\'s father, you are the\r\nman to get him off it."\r\n\r\nThe tutor\'s face clouded, and his glass dropped with a twang from his\r\neye.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t make that mistake again, Brandram--unless," and here his lips\r\nrelaxed into a quiet smile, "you mean by somebody, Miss Jill."\r\n\r\nDr Brandram read a good deal in this short sentence, and, like a good\r\nfriend, let the subject drop.\r\n\r\n"As Tom has gone to the Rectory to dinner," said the tutor, "I take it\r\nthe neighbourhood for twenty miles round will know of my return by this\r\ntime.  Meanwhile I must go back and possibly find out some thing from\r\nOliphant himself."\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant, however, was in no mood for confidences.  The sudden\r\nreturn of his co-trustee was extremely unwelcome at this juncture--\r\nindeed so manifestly unwelcome that Mr Armstrong was convinced he had\r\ncome back not a day too soon.\r\n\r\nThe captain professed great annoyance and indignation at what he termed\r\nthe desertion of his ward, and demanded to know when the tutor proposed\r\nto return to his duties.\r\n\r\n"In fact, sir," said he, "I desire to know what brings you here in this\r\nuncalled-for manner."\r\n\r\n"Business, my dear sir," replied the tutor.  "It need not incommode\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Your proper place is with your pupil.  Where have you left him?"\r\n\r\n"In London, prosecuting a search which neither you nor I consider to be\r\nvery hopeful.  I should not be surprised to see him back any day."\r\n\r\n"And may I ask the nature of the very pressing business which forms the\r\npretext of this abrupt return?  Am I to understand you and my ward have\r\nquarrelled?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir; we are excellent friends.  It\'s getting late; I\'ll say good\r\nnight."\r\n\r\n"By the way," said he at the door, "while I am here, there are a few\r\nsmall matters connected with the accounts which seemed to my unpractised\r\neye, when I went through Pottinger\'s books, to require some little\r\nelucidation.  If you have an hour or so to spare to-morrow, I should\r\nlike to go through them with you.  Good night."\r\n\r\nHe did not stay to notice the sudden pallor of his colleague\'s face, nor\r\ndid he overhear the gasp which greeted the closing of the door.\r\n\r\nThe captain did not go to bed that night.  For an hour he sat motionless\r\nin his chair, staring blankly into the fire; then, with a sudden access\r\nof industry, he went to the safe, and producing account-books, bank\r\nbooks, cheques, and other documents, spent some troubled hours over\r\ntheir contents.  That done, for another hour he paced the floor,\r\ndismally smoking a cigar.  Finally, when the early March dawn filtered\r\nthrough the blinds, he quitted the house, and surprised Mr Pottinger by\r\nan unexpected visit at breakfast-time.  Thence he proceeded to the bank;\r\nand after transacting his business there, returned easier in mind, but\r\nexhausted in body, to the seclusion of his room at Maxfield.\r\n\r\nThe tutor meanwhile was abroad on horseback with Tom and Jill.  The\r\nthree took a scamper over the downs, and returned by way of the shore.\r\nBiding with Tom and Jill, as may be imagined, was a series of\r\ncompetitive exercises, rather than a straightforward promenade.  Tom was\r\nan excellent rough horseman; and Jill, when Mr Armstrong was at hand,\r\nwas not the young lady to stick at anything.  They had tried handicaps,\r\nwater-jumps, hurdles, and were about to start for a ding-dong gallop\r\nalong the mile of hard strand which divided them from Maxfield, when the\r\ntutor\'s eye detected, perched a little way up the cliff, the figure of a\r\nyoung lady sketching.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll start you two," said he, "I scratch for this race.  Ride fair,\r\nTom; and Jill, give the mare her head when you get past the boulders.  I\r\nshall go back by the downs.  Are you ready now?  Pull in a bit, Tom.\r\nNow--off you go!"\r\n\r\nNot waiting to watch the issue of this momentous contest, he turned to\r\nwhere Rosalind sat, and reining up at the foot of her perch, dismounted.\r\n\r\nShe came down to meet him, palette in hand.\r\n\r\n"Mr Armstrong, I am so glad to see you.  I want to speak to you\r\ndreadfully.  Are you in a great hurry?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all.  Brandram told me you were in trouble, and I was wondering\r\nwhen and where I should have the opportunity of asking how I can help\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nHe tied his horse to a stake, and helped her back to her seat on the\r\ncliff.\r\n\r\nThere was an awkward pause, which he occupied by examining her picture\r\nwith a critical air.\r\n\r\n"Do you like it?" said she.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know.  I\'m no great judge.  Do you?"\r\n\r\n"I did, before you came.  I\'m not so sure now.  Do sit down and let me\r\nsay what I want to say."\r\n\r\nThe tutor, with a flutter at his breast, sat meekly, keeping his eyes\r\nstill on the picture.\r\n\r\n"Mr Armstrong, it\'s about Mr Ratman."\r\n\r\n"So Brandram said.  What of him?"\r\n\r\nRosalind told her father\'s story, except that she omitted any reference\r\nto the desperate proposition for satisfying his claims.\r\n\r\n"I am sure it is a fraud, or blackmail, or something of the sort.  For\r\nall that, he threatens to ruin father."\r\n\r\n"What does the debt amount to?"\r\n\r\n"Father spoke of thousands."\r\n\r\n"Does the creditor offer no terms?"\r\n\r\nRosalind flushed, and looked round.\r\n\r\n"None; that is, none that can be thought of for a moment."\r\n\r\n"I understand," said the tutor, to whom the reservation was explicit\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n"The difficulty is, that he has disappeared.  If we could find him I\r\nwould--"\r\n\r\n"You would allow me to go to him," said the tutor.  "No doubt the\r\nopportunity will soon come.  He wants money; he is bound to turn up."\r\n\r\n"But why should you be mixed up in father\'s troubles?" asked Rosalind\r\nafter a pause.\r\n\r\n"Your father\'s troubles are yours; your troubles are--shall we say?--\r\nRoger\'s; Roger\'s troubles are mine."\r\n\r\nThere was another long silence, during which Rosalind took up her\r\nbrushes and began work again on the picture, Mr Armstrong critically\r\nlooking on.\r\n\r\n"Have you no troubles of your own, then, that you have so much room in\r\nyou for those of other people?" she said at last.\r\n\r\n"I have had my share, perhaps.  Your picture, with its wide expanse of\r\ncalm sea, was just reminding me of one of them."\r\n\r\n"Tell me about it."\r\n\r\n"It was years ago, when, before I was a singer in London-- You knew I\r\nfollowed that honourable vocation once, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I have heard father speak of it.  Why not?"\r\n\r\n"No reason at all.  But before that I worked at the equally honourable\r\nprofession of a common sailor on a ship between New York and Ceylon.  At\r\nthat time I was about as wild and reckless as they make them, and\r\ndeluded myself into the foolish belief that I enjoyed it.  How I had\r\ncome to that pass I needn\'t tell you.  It wasn\'t all of a sudden, or\r\nwithout the assistance of other people.  I had a comrade on board--a man\r\nwho had once been a gentleman, but had come down in the world; who was\r\nnearly as bad as I, but not quite; for he sometimes talked of his home\r\nand his mother, and wished himself dead, which I never had the grace to\r\ndo."\r\n\r\n"Are you making this all up for my benefit," asked Rosalind, "or is it\r\ntrue?"\r\n\r\n"The story would not be worth telling if it were not true," said Mr\r\nArmstrong, screwing his glass into his eye and taking a fresh survey of\r\nthe picture.  "One very hot summer we were becalmed off Colombo, and lay\r\nfor days with nothing to do but whistle for a wind and quarrel among\r\nourselves.  My mate and I kept the peace for a couple of days, but then\r\nwe fell out like the rest.  I forget what it was about--a trifle,\r\nprobably a word.  We didn\'t fight on deck--it was too hot--but jumped\r\noverboard and fought in the water.  I remember, as I plunged, I caught\r\nsight, a hundred yards away, of an ugly grey fin lying motionless on the\r\nwater, and knew it belonged to a shark.  But I didn\'t care.  Well, we\r\ntwo fought in the water--partly in spite, partly to pass the time.\r\nSuddenly I could see my opponent\'s swarthy face become livid.  `Good\r\nGod!\' he gasped; `a shark!\' and quick as thought he caught me by the\r\nshoulders and pushed me between him and the brute.  I heard it swish up,\r\nand saw it half turn with gaping jaws.  In that moment I lived over my\r\nlife again, with all its folly and crime, and for the first time for\r\nyears I prayed.  How it happened I cannot tell; the shark must either\r\nhave made a bad shot at me or else I must have ducked instinctively, for\r\nI remember feeling the scrape of his fin across my cheek and being\r\npushed aside by his great tail.  Next moment my mate\'s hands let go\r\ntheir grip of me and there was a yell such as I pray I may never hear\r\nagain.  When at last they hauled me on board I was not the same man who\r\nthree minutes before had dived into the water.  That was the scene your\r\npicture reminded me of, Miss Oliphant.  You have told me one of your\r\ntroubles, and I have told you one of mine, which makes us quits.  But my\r\nhorse is getting fidgety down there; I must look after him.  Good-bye."\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong was a little surprised, when he came to go through the\r\naccounts with his co-trustee that afternoon, to find that he must have\r\nbeen mistaken in his previous supposition that they were not all correct\r\nand straightforward.  Everything appeared quite plain and properly\r\naccounted for, and he agreed with the figures, rather abashed to feel\r\nthat, after all, he was not as acute a man of business as he had\r\nflattered himself.  Mr Pottinger and the captain rallied him about his\r\ndeserted mares\'-nest, and bored him with invitations to go through all\r\nthe items again, to give him a chance of proving them wrong.  He\r\ndeclined with thanks, and signed the balance with the best grace he\r\ncould summon.\r\n\r\n"Odd," said he to himself, as he strode home after the interview;\r\n"either you must be very clever or I must be very stupid.  I should\r\ngreatly like to know which it is."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\r\n\r\nMR. RATMAN VISITS HIS PROPERTY.\r\n\r\n"Dear Armstrong," wrote Roger from London about a week after the tutor\'s\r\nreturn to Maxfield, "you will be surprised to hear I am just off to\r\nParis to look for a Mr Pantalzar.  This is how it comes about.  Long\r\nStreet does not exist, as I told you, nor any trace of the family\r\nCallot.  But old Directories are still available, and in one of these I\r\nfound that fifteen years ago there was a Long Street, and that Number 2\r\nwas then occupied by a person of the uncommon name I have mentioned.\r\nThe name seemed too promising a one to be let drop; so I tracked it down\r\nto the year before last, when I found a Pantalzar was proprietor of a\r\ncook-shop in Shoreditch.  Of course, when I went to inquire, my\r\ngentleman had vanished.  I\'m sick of asking the interminable question,\r\n`Does So-and-so live here?\'  The present cook-man, however, remembered\r\nthe queer name as that belonging to his predecessor, and informed me\r\nthat, not having made the business pay over here, he had decamped two\r\nyears ago without saying good-bye to his creditors, and announced his\r\nintention of starting a _cafe_ in Paris.  This, then, is my off-chance.\r\nUnless he has changed his name, I should be able to discover him in\r\nParis; and if he turns out to be the man who once lived at Number 2 Long\r\nStreet, he may be able to tell me something about the Callots; and the\r\nCallots, if by a miracle I can find them, may be able to tell me\r\nsomething about Rogers, the Ghost in _Hamlet_.  I only wish you were\r\ncoming to back me up, but, from what you say, I would ever so much\r\nrather you remained on the spot at Maxfield.  I hope it will be possible\r\nto help Oliphant out of his fix.  Try.  You\'d better write to the _Poste\r\nRestante_ at Paris.  Remember me at home.\r\n\r\n"Yours ever,--\r\n\r\n"R.  Ingleton."\r\n\r\nThe tutor read this letter with a somewhat troubled countenance.  It\r\nproved to him that his ward was desperately in earnest in his uphill\r\nquest, and it filled him with some concern to feel that he himself was\r\nnot, where he should have liked to be, at the boy\'s side.\r\n\r\nBut to leave Maxfield at present seemed impossible.  Rosalind claimed\r\nhis help on behalf of her father; and the possibility that any day Mr\r\nRatman might turn up and court exposure decided the tutor to remain\r\nwhere he was.  Another motive for this step was a haunting perplexity as\r\nto the hallucination under which he had apparently laboured with regard\r\nto the estate accounts.  He never flattered himself he was a\r\nparticularly good man of business, but it puzzled him to explain why a\r\nfew weeks ago there should have appeared to be discrepancies and\r\nirregularities to the tune of several hundred pounds, whereas now\r\neverything was in startling apple-pie order.\r\n\r\nMuch to Mr Pottinger\'s annoyance, he took to visiting the honest\r\nlawyer\'s office every other day, and spent hours in trying to discover\r\nwhere it was he had made his great mistake.  Mr Pottinger was unable to\r\nrender him any assistance; and the captain, when once he referred to the\r\nsubject, only smiled pityingly and advised him to take a few lessons in\r\nthe elements of finance; which advice, to do him justice, the tutor\r\nhumbly proceeded to take.  The result was to deepen his perplexity and\r\ncause him to regret that he had so compliantly countersigned an account\r\nwhich, every time he studied it in the light of his new wisdom, appeared\r\nto bristle with problems.\r\n\r\nFaithful to her promise, at the end of a week Rosalind presented herself\r\nat Maxfield.\r\n\r\n"Well, my child?" said the parent blandly, laying down his newspaper.\r\n\r\n"I said I would come and speak again about what you were saying the\r\nother day.  Have you heard any more from your creditor?"\r\n\r\n"Things remain, as far as he is concerned, in _statu quo_; and I am no\r\nnearer being able to satisfy him to-day than I was a week ago; unless,\r\nindeed--"\r\n\r\n"All I have to say," said Rosalind nervously, "is, that I would work\r\nlike a slave to help you, if I could."\r\n\r\n"Is that all?" asked the captain with falling face.\r\n\r\n"You know it is, father.  You knew it a week ago.  You knew I would even\r\ngo to this man and on my knees beg him to be merciful."\r\n\r\nHer father laughed dismally.\r\n\r\n"In other words," said he, "you can do nothing.  I do not complain; I\r\nexpected nothing, and I have not been disappointed.  I was foolish to\r\nthink such a thing possible; Heaven knows I have been punished for my\r\nfolly."\r\n\r\nShe tried hard to keep back the tears, and rose to go.\r\n\r\n"Stay!" said he sternly; "I have a question to ask you.  A week ago you\r\nseemed to hold a different mind to this.  What has changed it?"\r\n\r\n"No," said she, "it was out of the question; you said so yourself."\r\n\r\n"I ask you," repeated he sternly, and not heeding her protest, "what has\r\nchanged it?  Have you taken counsel with any one on the subject?  Have\r\nyou spoken to any one of this wretched business?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I have spoken to Mr Armstrong."\r\n\r\n"Exactly.  I thought as much.  I understand.  Leave me, Rosalind."\r\n\r\n"Father, you are wrong-- Oh, but you must hear me," she said, as he\r\nraised his hand deprecatingly and took up his newspaper.  "You must not\r\nmisunderstand.  I told Mr Armstrong of your difficulties, and who your\r\ncreditor was.  I told him no more.  My only object was to see if there\r\nwas any way to help you."\r\n\r\n"You mean to tell me," said he, interrupting in an angry voice, "that\r\nyou considered it consistent with your duty as a daughter to gossip\r\nabout my private affairs with a scoundrel who--"\r\n\r\n"No, father," she said.  "Mr Armstrong is a gentleman--"\r\n\r\n"Naturally _you_ say so.  But enough of this.  I forbid you, as I have\r\nalready done, to hold any communication with Mr Armstrong.  Know that,\r\nof the two men, the man you affect to scorn is infinitely less a villain\r\nthan this smug hypocrite.  Go!"\r\n\r\nShe made no reply, but went, choking with misery and a smarting sense of\r\ninjustice.  No longer was it easy to hug herself into the delusion that\r\nthis was all a horrid dream.  Her father stood on the brink of ruin, and\r\nshe could not help him.\r\n\r\n"If only," said she, "it had been anything else!  O God, pity my poor\r\nfather!"\r\n\r\nThe captain\'s thoughts were of a very different kind.  He had clung to\r\nthe hope that Rosalind would after all solve his difficulties by\r\nundertaking the venture he had set before her.  He had already in\r\nimagination soothed his own conscience and smoothed away all the\r\ndifficulties which beset the undertaking.\r\n\r\n"It might be for her good, after all, dear girl!  She will reclaim him.\r\nA fortune lies before them; for Roger will be easily convinced, and will\r\nsurrender his claim to them.  Ratman is too long-sighted not to see that\r\nI can help him in the matter, and that on my own terms.  We shall start\r\nfresh with a clear balance-sheet, and live in comfort."  Now, however,\r\nthese bright hopes were dashed, and to the captain\'s mind he owed his\r\nfailure, first and last, to Mr Frank Armstrong.  Had he not come home,\r\nhe said to himself, Rosalind would have yielded.\r\n\r\nWith him still at Maxfield everything came to a dead lock.  Ratman could\r\nnot be propitiated, still less satisfied.  The accounts would be\r\nrestlessly scrutinised.\r\n\r\nRosalind, and in less degree Tom and Jill, would be mutinous.  Roger, at\r\nhome or abroad, would be beyond reach.\r\n\r\nAll the grudges of the past months seemed to culminate in this crowning\r\ninjury; and if to wish ill to one\'s fellow is to be a murderer, Captain\r\nOliphant had already come perilously near to adding one new sin to his\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nBut where, all this while, was the ingenuous Mr Ratman?  Why had he\r\nnot, true to his word, come to claim his own--if not the Maxfield\r\nestate, at any rate the little balance due to him from his old Indian\r\ncrony?\r\n\r\nThe captain, after a week or two of disappointed dread, was beginning to\r\nrecover a little of his ease of mind, and flattering himself that, after\r\nall his creditor\'s bark was worse than his bite, when the blow abruptly\r\nfell.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong had gone for the day to visit one of his very few old\r\ncollege friends on the other side of the county, and Tom, released from\r\nhis lessons (the captain\'s animosity for the tutor, by the way, stopped\r\nshort at withdrawing his son from the benefit of the gratuitous\r\neducation of which for the last year that youth had been the recipient)\r\nwas trundling a "boneshaker" bicycle along the Yeld lanes, when he\r\nperceived the jaunty form of Mr Ratman, bag in hand and cigar in mouth,\r\nstrolling leisurely in the direction of Maxfield.\r\n\r\nTom, who was only a beginner in the art of cycling, was so taken aback\r\nby this apparition, that, after one or two furious lurches from one side\r\nof the road to the other, and a frantic effort to keep his balance, he\r\ncame ignominiously to the ground at the very feet of the visitor.\r\n\r\n"Hullo!" said that worthy; "as full of fun as ever, I see."\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Ratty!" said Tom, picking himself up; "got over your kicking?"\r\n\r\nThis genial reference to the circumstances under which the so-called\r\nlost heir had last quitted Maxfield grated somewhat harshly on the\r\nfeelings of the gentleman to whom it was addressed.\r\n\r\n"Look here, young fellow," said he, "you\'d better keep a civil tongue in\r\nyour head, or I shall have to pull your ear."\r\n\r\n"Try it," retorted Tom.\r\n\r\nMr Ratman seemed inclined to accept the invitation; but as he was\r\nanxious for information just now, he decided to forego the experiment.\r\n\r\n"Is your father at home?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"Rather.  You\'d better go back the way you came.  We know all about you\r\nup there," said Tom.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right.  And how are your pretty sisters, Tommy?"\r\n\r\nIf any insult more than another could disturb the temper of Master\r\nOliphant, it was to be called "Tommy," as many of the rustic youths of\r\nthe neighbourhood knew to their cost.  He therefore replied shortly,\r\n"Find out," and proceeded to address himself to the task of remounting\r\nhis machine.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I\'m going to do.  Here, let me hold it for you, or you\'ll\r\nbreak your neck."\r\n\r\n"Look here," said the outraged Tom, thoroughly roused by this crowning\r\nindignity, "I don\'t want to be seen out here talking to cads.  I don\'t\r\nmind fighting you.  If you don\'t care for that, keep your cheek to\r\nyourself, and go and talk to somebody who\'s fond of rot.  I\'m not."  And\r\nthe young bruiser, who had an uncommonly broad pair of shoulders, looked\r\nso threatening that Mr Ratman began to feel a little concerned.\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha!" said he, "how well you do it!  I always liked you, Tommy, my\r\nboy.  I\'ll let your tutor know what a credit you are to him."\r\n\r\n"I wish to goodness Armstrong was at home," growled Tom; "he\'d make you\r\nsit up."\r\n\r\nThis was just the information Mr Ratman had been anxious to get.  The\r\nprospect of encountering Mr Armstrong had interfered considerably with\r\nhis pleasure in arranging this visit.  But if he was out of the way--\r\nwell, so much more the luck of Mr Ratman.  Therefore, without wasting\r\ntime in further parley with this possible brother-in-law, he proceeded\r\njauntily on his way.\r\n\r\n"You won\'t fight, then?" said Tom by way of farewell.\r\n\r\n"Some day."\r\n\r\n"All right.  Coward!  Good-bye, Mr Roger Ingleton, major!"\r\n\r\nHaving relieved himself of which appropriate sentiment, Tom felt\r\ndecidedly better, and walked his bicycle down the hill, determined to\r\nkeep clear of Maxfield till the evening.\r\n\r\nMr Ratman, somewhat ruffled, but on the whole cheerful, swaggered on to\r\nhis destination.\r\n\r\nThe captain was luxuriously smoking a cigar and solacing himself with a\r\nsporting paper, when Raffles sent his heart to his mouth by announcing--\r\n\r\n"Mr Ingleton, sir, to see you."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Ratman!" said he with a forced air of welcome as his creditor\r\nentered.  "I didn\'t recognise you by your new name.  You\'re keeping it\r\nup, then?"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" demanded Mr Ratman, taking an easy-chair and\r\nhelping himself to a cigar from the captain\'s box.  "It\'s you who are\r\nkeeping it up, I fancy.  I\'ll trouble you to drop the Ratman."\r\n\r\nThe captain laughed unpleasantly.\r\n\r\n"As you like," said he.\r\n\r\n"Now to business.  Of course, you\'re ready to make good these little\r\nbills," and he pulled four or five blue slips from his pocket.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not.  You may as well know it at once."\r\n\r\n"Hum!  What do you propose, then?  Do you know there\'s a writ out?"\r\n\r\n"I propose nothing.  I want to know what you propose."\r\n\r\nThe two men regarded one another in silence; one insolent and sneering,\r\nthe other desperate and scowling.\r\n\r\n"What do I propose?" said Ratman, puffing away cheerfully.  "Scarcely\r\nanything--only to make a little communication to the War Office, give a\r\nfew instructions to the Sheriff, write a paragraph or two to the county\r\npapers, and tell a few interesting anecdotes to your charming\r\ndaughters."\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant started to his feet with a smothered exclamation.\r\n\r\n"Not the last, Ratman!  I\'m in your clutches; but for Heaven\'s sake\r\ndon\'t bring them into it!"\r\n\r\nRatman laughed.\r\n\r\n"You _will_ insist on forgetting my name, my dear fellow.  Yes, that\'s\r\nmy little programme.  I fancy I may as well begin at the end."\r\n\r\n"Look here," pleaded the victim; "I know it\'s no use appealing to your\r\npity, for you have none; or your honesty, for you\'ve less of that than I\r\nhave.  But doesn\'t it occur to you that it would be decidedly against\r\nyour interest to ruin me just now?"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" said Ratman with a yawn.\r\n\r\n"Why, you claim a certain name, and you have to prove your claim.  Roger\r\nhas got the romantic notion into his head that if his elder brother can\r\nbe found, that brother shall have the property.  He is more than half\r\ninclined to credit your story already.  You have to satisfy two other\r\npersons, of whom I am one.  Do you understand?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly," said Mr Ratman, who began to be interested.  "I anticipate\r\nno difficulty there."\r\n\r\n"You forget that at present only a sickly boy stands between myself and\r\nthe property.  It would surely mean something on my part for me to admit\r\na second life between."\r\n\r\n"What is the use of talking nonsense?" said Ratman.  "Even if you did,\r\nfor the sake of a little longer credit I might give you, own my right to\r\nmy own name, what\'s the use of that, when this man Armstrong has to be\r\nsatisfied too?  If you could crack that nut there might be something in\r\nit."\r\n\r\nThe captain groaned.  He knew that every project would be pulled up\r\nshort at this sticking-point.\r\n\r\n"Come," said Ratman encouragingly, "if you could work things in that\r\ndirection, it might be worth my while to give you time."\r\n\r\n"I can do nothing.  The fellow is immovable.  In six months--"\r\n\r\n"In six months everything will be too late.  And now, what about the\r\nother matter?  Is that all right?"\r\n\r\nOnce more the captain groaned.  "I can say nothing about it yet.  She\r\nknows my wishes, but as Robert Ratman she will not hear a word of it.\r\nAs Roger Ingleton, the elder, you may depend on it the matter will take\r\nanother view.  All depends on your success there.  When that\'s achieved,\r\nthe rest will come if you give her time."\r\n\r\nMr Ratman sneered.\r\n\r\n"You are a glib talker, Oliphant.  I admire you.  Now listen.  You want\r\ncredit, and you know how to buy it.  One way or another, this business\r\nmust come to an end.  I\'ll take new bills with interest at three months.\r\nBy that time everything must be square and smooth; otherwise you\'ll be\r\nsorry you and your children were born, my boy.  Order dinner.  I\'m going\r\nback by the six train.  Pass me that paper, and don\'t disturb me any\r\nmore by your talking."\r\n\r\nAs Mr Ratman, very well satisfied with his day\'s business, strolled\r\nserenely back through the park that afternoon, he was surprised to hear\r\nlight footsteps behind him, and, on turning, to discover that his\r\npursuer, of all people, was Miss Rosalind Oliphant.\r\n\r\n"Hullo!" said he, "this is flattering, with a vengeance."\r\n\r\n"Mr Ratman, I want to speak to you, please," said Rosalind, very pale\r\nand nervous.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me," said he, "that\'s not my name; my name is Roger Ingleton.\r\nWhat\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s about my father.  Have you seen him?"\r\n\r\n"Just left the dear man."\r\n\r\n"He says he owes you money, and that you threaten to ruin him.  Is that\r\nso?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, if you want to know, it is."\r\n\r\n"How much is it, please?"\r\n\r\nRatman laughed.\r\n\r\n"Nothing.  A trifle.  Fifteen hundred pounds or thereabouts."\r\n\r\n"Fifteen hundred!" faltered she.  "Does he owe you all that."\r\n\r\nThe little she had to offer was a drop in the bucket only.\r\n\r\n"Look here," said he; "Miss Rosy, your father\'s in a fix.  I don\'t want\r\nto be hard on him, but I must have my money or its equivalent.  Now, I\r\nshould consider it a very fair equivalent to be allowed to call him\r\nfather-in-law.  I may not be up to your mark in some things, Miss\r\nRosalind, but I\'ve a good name, and I flatter myself I know beauty when\r\nI see it.  Now, think over it.  It\'s the only chance your father\'s got,\r\nand you might do worse for yourself than become the mistress of\r\nMaxfield.  Good-bye.  Shake hands."\r\n\r\nShe drew herself up with an air and a flush of colour which redoubled\r\nhis admiration, and without a word, turned away with rapid steps.\r\n\r\nMr Ratman was sorely tempted to follow this beautiful creature, who, in\r\nall his chequered career, had been the only human being to discover the\r\nfew last dregs of affection in his nature.  As much as it was possible\r\nin such a man, he was in love with this debtor\'s daughter.  The\r\nsensation was novel and exhilarating enough to afford him food for\r\ncheerful reflection as he walked on towards the station.\r\n\r\nSo engrossed was he in his day-dreams that he forgot that even country\r\ntrains are occasionally punctual, and that, at least, he had not much\r\ntime left him to catch the one he aimed at.  Indeed, it was not till,\r\nwithin a few minutes of the station, he caught sight of the train\r\nalready standing at the platform that it occurred to him to bestir\r\nhimself.  He ran, shouted, and waved his arm all at the same time, but\r\nto no effect.  The whistle blew as he entered the yard, and as he\r\nreached the platform the guard\'s van was gliding out of the station.\r\n\r\nThoroughly ruffled--for this was the last train to town--Mr Ratman\r\nvented his wrath on the world in general, and the railway officials in\r\nparticular, even including in his objurgations an unlucky passenger who\r\nhad arrived by the train and shared with him the uninterrupted\r\npossession of the platform.\r\n\r\n"Easy, young man," said the latter, a substantial-looking, bony\r\nindividual with a wrinkled face, and speaking with a decided American\r\ntwang.  "You\'ll hurt yourself, I reckon, if you talk like that.  It\'s\r\nbad for the jaws."\r\n\r\nMr Ratman took a contemptuous survey of the stranger and quitted the\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\nHis first idea was to return to Maxfield and demand entertainment there\r\nfor the night.  But since he would have to walk all the way, and the\r\nfirst train in the morning left Yeld at eight, he decided to put up at\r\nthe little hotel of the village instead, and with that object threw\r\nhimself and his bag into the omnibus of that establishment which waited\r\non the trains.\r\n\r\nSomewhat to his disgust, the stranger, after collecting his baggage,\r\nentered the same vehicle and took a seat opposite him.\r\n\r\n"Wal," said he, "you\'ll have time to cool down before the next train,\r\nyoung man.  Putting up at the hotel?"\r\n\r\n"Where else should I put up?" growled Ratman.  "What business is it of\r\nyours?"\r\n\r\n"I guess it\'s my business to get all the information I can on this trip.\r\nI came over this side to learn."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve come to a queer hole to do it," said Ratman, beginning to feel\r\nhe might as well resign himself to circumstances.\r\n\r\n"Just so.  It\'s changed a bit since I was here last.  We had to drive\r\nfrom Barbeck then."\r\n\r\n"So you know the place, do you?" inquired Ratman.\r\n\r\n"That\'s so," was the laconic rejoinder.  "A resident, likely?"\r\n\r\n"Well, not at present, or I shouldn\'t be going to the inn."\r\n\r\n"Down here on business, I reckon?  I was a bagman myself once."\r\n\r\n"You\'re wrong again.  I\'ve been down to see my property, if you want to\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"Large estate, no doubt?  Anywhere near my friend Ingleton\'s plot, now?"\r\n\r\nMr Ratman stared at the stranger with something like consternation.\r\n\r\n"Ingleton!" he exclaimed.  "What do you know of Ingleton?"\r\n\r\nHere the omnibus pulled up.\r\n\r\n"Wal, I reckon I should know something of my own family," drawled the\r\nstranger as he alighted.  "What say?--shall we have a snack of something\r\nin the parlour!  Come along."\r\n\r\nThe landlord led the way into the coffee-room.  He knew Mr Ratman by\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\n"Sorry we can\'t give you and your friend the private room, sir, but\r\nthere\'s only one other gentleman in the coffee-room, and he\'s going\r\ndirectly."\r\n\r\nAs they entered, the other gentleman, who was drying his boots at the\r\nfire, turned round, and Mr Ratman had the rapture of finding himself\r\nface to face with Mr Armstrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN OLIPHANT PAYS ONE OF HIS DEBTS.\r\n\r\nMr Ratman\'s natural modesty prompted a precipitate retreat from the\r\nembarrassing vicinity of the gentleman whom he had last seen with a\r\nhorsewhip in his hand; but prudence and the presence of the stranger,\r\nand the lack of any other place to go to, prevailed upon him to remain.\r\n\r\nThe stranger, apparently unaware of the presence of a third party,\r\ncontinued his conversation where it had been interrupted.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said he, "I reckon I should know something of my own family,\r\nalthough it\'s a generation since I set foot in these parts."\r\n\r\n"Yes; all right," said Ratman uncomfortably.  "I\'ll go and order\r\ndinner."\r\n\r\nBut the entrance of the landlord prevented this manoeuvre.\r\n\r\n"The gig from Maxfield is in the village, Mr Armstrong," said he,\r\naddressing the tutor.  "I\'ve sent word to Robbins to call for you in\r\nhalf an hour.  Maybe, if Mr Ratman is going up, you could give him a\r\nlift."\r\n\r\n"Mr Ratman is not going up," said Mr Armstrong.\r\n\r\nThe stranger here took notice of the tutor.\r\n\r\n"Friend of my friend, eh?" said he.  "Pleased to know you, sir.\r\nResident in these parts, I presume?  What?"\r\n\r\n"Quite so," said Mr Armstrong, putting up his glass, and honouring the\r\nspeaker with a minute survey.\r\n\r\n"As I was saying to our young friend here, there\'s been changes in this\r\nlocality since I was here about the time of Noah.  You named Maxfield\r\njust now, sir.  Likely you know Squire Ingleton, my relative, at the\r\nmanor-house there?"\r\n\r\nThe tutor\'s glass dropped abruptly.\r\n\r\n"Your relative?  What relation were you to the old Squire?"\r\n\r\n"_Was_ I--is he dead, then?"\r\n\r\n"More than a year ago."\r\n\r\n"Sir," said the stranger, with some excitement, "that man was my\r\nsister\'s husband.  I guess I\'ve come here a trifle late.  Dead?  He\r\ndidn\'t look to have it in him.  What say?"\r\n\r\nIt said a good deal for Mr Ratman\'s nerve that in the tutor\'s presence\r\nhe took upon himself to reply boldly--\r\n\r\n"My father died rather suddenly a year since.  So you are my uncle?"\r\n\r\nThe American mayor stared at the speaker in bewilderment, which was not\r\nlessened by an abrupt laugh from the gentleman at the fireplace.\r\n\r\n"I guess I\'ll take a seat and work this out," said he.  "I\'m your uncle,\r\nam I?  I never should have known it, if you hadn\'t been so obliging as\r\nto tell me, young man.  Which branch of the family tree do you hang on\r\nto?"\r\n\r\n"Your sister had a son, Roger Ingleton.  That\'s my name."\r\n\r\n"Is that so?  And you\'re the present Squire of Maxfield?  Well, well.\r\nWhen did you come to life again?"\r\n\r\n"There was a false report of my death," said Ratman, glancing a little\r\nnervously at the tutor, who was diligently removing the mud from his\r\nriding-boots.\r\n\r\n"Wal, it\'s singular.  I never expected to see a nephew of mine again.\r\nWhy, how long is it, now, since I went over?  Thirty-seven years if it\'s\r\na day."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t remember that," said Ratman tentatively.\r\n\r\n"Seeing you weren\'t born, you\'d find it hard," said Mr Headland.  "But,\r\nsay, by all accounts you were a troublesome boy."\r\n\r\n"I was not all I might have been," replied Mr Ratman, beginning to wish\r\nthis cross-examination was over.\r\n\r\n"Put it that way, certainly.  You ran away, and left your mother, my\r\nsister, with a broken heart, I\'ve heard say."\r\n\r\n"My father and I quarrelled, and I left home--yes."\r\n\r\nHere the tutor quitted the fire and came to where the two men sat.\r\n\r\n"Excuse my interrupting you, sir," said he to the stranger, "but your\r\nconversation interests me.  The fact is, the Squire married a second\r\ntime, and left a son, whose guardian I happen to be.  By the old man\'s\r\nwill my ward is the heir.  You will allow I have a right to feel\r\ninterested in this gentleman, who only discovered six months ago that he\r\nwas the lost elder brother."\r\n\r\nThe good American sat back in his chair and looked from Ratman to\r\nArmstrong, and from Armstrong back to Ratman, in a state of painful\r\nbewilderment.\r\n\r\n"Now," said the tutor, "my ward feels a little curiosity about his elder\r\nbrother--only natural, is it not?--and I, as his legal guardian,\r\nnaturally share that curiosity."\r\n\r\n"Why, certainly," said the Mayor, beginning to be interested.\r\n\r\nMr Ratman began to lose countenance, and fidgeted uncomfortably with\r\nthe forks and spoons.\r\n\r\n"I have heard a little of this gentleman\'s romantic career," continued\r\nthe tutor, with his half-drawl.  "He has been good enough to tell us, in\r\nfact, that when he left home--by the way, when was that, Ratman?"\r\n\r\n"When I know your right to ask me questions," growled Ratman, "I\'ll see\r\nabout answering them."\r\n\r\n"Seems to me," said the Mayor, assuming judicial functions for the time\r\nbeing, "unless you\'ve disgraced yourself, you can\'t hurt much by saying.\r\nYou say you\'re the Squire\'s son; this gentleman--I didn\'t catch your\r\nname, sir?--Armstrong?--Mr Armstrong says he\'s not as sure as you are.\r\nSeems to me, if you tell one thing, you may as well tell another.  It\'s\r\nall one story, and if it\'s true, it\'s a good one."\r\n\r\nMr Ratman did not like the turn affairs were taking.  If he refused to\r\nreply to the questions put to him, he was aware that he was damaging his\r\nown claim.  If he answered, how was he to know if the risk was not even\r\ngreater?  And yet, what more was Armstrong likely to know about the lost\r\nson than he himself?  He might as well go through with it.  So he\r\nreplied, sullenly--\r\n\r\n"I left home a year before my mother died.  He can get the date of that\r\nfrom the tombstone, if he wants it."\r\n\r\n"Thanks; I\'ll look at it," said the tutor with aggravating cheerfulness.\r\n"You went up to London, didn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve told you so, and that I lived there with a man called Fastnet."\r\n\r\n"And then you went abroad, I think you said?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; to India."\r\n\r\n"Just so; that\'s where you died, is it not?  You stayed in London long\r\nenough to go to the dogs, I understood you to say?"\r\n\r\n"That didn\'t take long.  I spent all my money in six months, and then\r\nenlisted," said Ratman, feeling fairly launched by this time.\r\n\r\n"Quite so.  And you died, I believe, in India?"\r\n\r\n"I was supposed to have died in a skirmish; and they sent news home that\r\nI had.  I never corrected it."\r\n\r\n"Whereabouts was the skirmish, if it\'s a fair question?"\r\n\r\n"On the frontier.  I forget the name."\r\n\r\n"That\'s unfortunate.  By the way, to go back to London, do you recollect\r\nwhere Mr Fastnet lived?  I should like to call on him."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t find him; he died before I went abroad--drank himself to\r\ndeath."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to hear that.  And you enlisted under your present name of\r\nRatman, of course?"\r\n\r\n"My present name is Ingleton.  If I called myself Ratman, that was\r\nbecause I didn\'t want my father to hear of me.  I never told any one my\r\nreal name."\r\n\r\n"Seems to me," said the Mayor, "it\'s odd how your medical adviser on the\r\nfield of battle found out where to write home to say you were dead."\r\n\r\n"It is still more odd, sir," said the tutor, fixing the claimant with\r\nhis glass, "that this Mr Fastnet (who, you will be glad to hear, has\r\nalso come to life again, was still in good health when my ward saw him a\r\nfew weeks ago) retains a vivid recollection of the runaway son having\r\nentertained him for a year at his own lodgings; at the end of which time\r\nthe prodigal, so far from enlisting, took to the stage, and spent\r\nanother year, at least, with a company of strolling players.\r\n\r\n"We have your unfortunate\'s nephew\'s story," proceeded the tutor,\r\n"carefully traced up to a certain point, and if either you or Mr Ratman\r\nare interested in the matter, we can produce our witnesses.  Your memory\r\nis a treacherous one, Robert Ratman.  It is no use asking you, I fear,\r\nwhat became of you after a certain riot in Boulogne when you, as the\r\nGhost in `Hamlet,\' and your fellow-tragedians were mobbed for not paying\r\nthe rent of your hall?"\r\n\r\nMr Ratman, who during this cross-examination had passed through all the\r\nstages from blustering rage to abject discomfiture, sank back on his\r\nchair and turned a livid face to his questioner.  He had sense enough to\r\nsee that the game was up; and not being an actor himself, he was at a\r\nloss to conceal his defeat.  The tutor\'s cold, keen gaze took the heart\r\nout of him.\r\n\r\n"Lying dog!" snarled he, "I\'ve had enough of your questions.  You think\r\nyourself clever, but I\'ll be even with you yet.  I\'ll ruin the lot of\r\nyou--you and your fellow-scoundrel and his brats, who don\'t know yet\r\nwhat it is to have a felon for a father.  You\'ll be sorry for this."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he took up his bag, and with the best swagger he could assume\r\nslunk from the room.\r\n\r\n"See--stay here, young man," said the Mayor excitedly; "there\'s\r\nsomething else."\r\n\r\nBut he was gone.  The outer door slammed to and his footsteps died\r\ngradually away down the street.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong and the stranger exchanged glances in silence.  Then the\r\nMayor turned to Mr Armstrong with a stern face.\r\n\r\n"Seems to me, sir," said he, "that if that young man\'s the knave, you\'re\r\nuncommon like the fool.  You\'ll excuse me mentioning it after the\r\nservice you have just rendered to the cause of veracity, but it\'s a\r\nsolemn fact."\r\n\r\n"I have heard the same opinion expressed by other authorities, and I\r\nhave no doubt it is true.  You mean to tell me I should have extorted\r\nfrom him a written recantation of his claim?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s so; you guess right.  Consequence is, I\'m bound to stay now as a\r\nwitness to see this quarrel through.  Here have I come on a pleasure-\r\ntrip to see my relatives, and it seems I\'ve got to combine business and\r\npleasure after all."\r\n\r\n"You forget I\'ve no hold over this man.  He does not claim the property,\r\nalthough he guesses that my ward will hand it over to him if he proves\r\nhis identity.  I can only show him to be a liar."\r\n\r\n"You seem pretty sure of that."\r\n\r\n"I am myself; and I hope, for everybody\'s sake, that your nephew, if he\r\nshould turn up, will be a better credit to the name than this land-\r\nshark."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, I don\'t thank you for dragging me into the business; but,\r\nsince I am here, I stay to see it out."\r\n\r\n"I am relieved to hear you say so."\r\n\r\n"Tell me now," said the Mayor, "what the story is; and what does our\r\nyoung friend mean by his farewell threats?"\r\n\r\nThereupon Mr Armstrong gave his new ally a faithful account of the\r\nfamily difficulty: of Captain Oliphant\'s embarrassing relations to the\r\nclaimant, of Miss Rosalind\'s dilemma, of Roger\'s quixotic determination\r\nto find his lost brother, and of his own--the tutor\'s--conviction of the\r\nhopelessness of the quest.\r\n\r\nThe visitor by no means shared the last conclusion.\r\n\r\n"I rather calculate that lost young man ain\'t as dead as you think,"\r\nsaid he.  "By all accounts he wasn\'t born to be drowned, and he\'s not\r\nhung yet.  You bet, the young brother will come up with him before\r\ntime\'s called."\r\n\r\n"Well, by the last accounts he seems to have a vague clue as to his\r\nwhereabouts fifteen years ago," said the tutor; "we shall hear what he\r\nmakes of it.  To-morrow you must come up to Maxfield and see my co-\r\ntrustee."\r\n\r\nThe presence of this unexpected friend of the family, in the capacity of\r\nimpartial umpire, struck the tutor as particularly opportune at this\r\njuncture.  He had been a witness to Ratman\'s virtual admission to his\r\nimposture, and his natural interest in the discovery of his own nephew\r\nwas not likely to warp his determination to see fair play for Roger.\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant, when he heard next morning of the new arrival, by no\r\nmeans shared his co-trustee\'s satisfaction.  The news, indeed, agitated\r\nhim to a remarkable degree, and he astonished the tutor by his ill-\r\nconcealed reluctance to meet him.\r\n\r\n"It is important that you should see him," remarked the tutor.  "As the\r\nuncle of the lost elder brother he is entitled, I think, to our\r\nconfidence.  I can imagine no reason why you should be afraid to see\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Afraid!  Who says I am afraid to see him?"\r\n\r\n"I can think of no other explanation of your reluctance--"\r\n\r\n"Please, sir, Mr Headland to see you," announced Raffles.\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant changed colour as he turned to greet the visitor.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll pardon the early call," said the latter, "but they gave me such\r\na shocking supper at the inn, that I resolved to try my luck up here for\r\nbreakfast.  Captain Oliphant, I presume?--friend of my friend Armstrong.\r\nPleased to know you, sir.  Pity you weren\'t with us last night to see\r\nthe decline and fall of your ingenious friend, R.  Ratman.  Your\r\ncolleague, sir, put that young man to bed in a way that would have made\r\nyou enjoy yourself.  Seems to me, captain, you are well rid of him."\r\n\r\n"I fail to understand all this," said the captain.  "If you refer to Mr\r\nRatman\'s claims to be the lost Roger Ingleton--"\r\n\r\n"My nephew," interposed the American.\r\n\r\n"All I can say is, that I am not at all satisfied the claim is not a\r\njust one."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," said Mr Headland, "if that\'s your opinion, it\'s more than\r\nthat young man thinks himself by this time.  But never mind that."\r\n\r\n"I do mind it, sir; and I should like to know what right any one has to\r\ndecide the matter for me?  I would suggest that, though we are pleased\r\nto see you, you should allow us to attend to our own business."\r\n\r\n"I not only allow you, sir, but I expect it of you.  And that reminds me\r\nof a question that has been puzzling me ever since I heard of the\r\nSquire\'s death.  I wrote him a letter in the fall of last year."\r\n\r\nThe captain was seized with a sudden impulse to stir the fire, and as he\r\nstood thus with his back turned, Mr Armstrong could not help wondering\r\nwhat there was in the operation so violently to agitate the operator\'s\r\nframe.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, a letter dated November 9th, which must have been delivered,\r\nas I have made inquiries, and find it was not returned.  It contained\r\nmoney, and as it was never acknowledged, I had fears it was lost."\r\n\r\n"Any letters for the Squire have been opened by his executors.  I\r\nrecollect none from abroad--do you, Captain Oliphant?" said the tutor.\r\n\r\nThe Captain, still with his back turned, said-- "No; it never came into\r\nmy hands."\r\n\r\n"Mrs Ingleton would hardly be likely to have opened it.  It would be\r\nonly a short time before her death."\r\n\r\n"It\'s singular," said the Mayor.  "My clerk posted it.  He should have\r\nregistered it, but omitted."\r\n\r\n"How was it directed?" asked the captain, turning at last, and pale\r\nafter his exertions.\r\n\r\n"Roger Ingleton, senior, Maxfield, England."\r\n\r\n"Hum!  Did your clerk know it contained money?"\r\n\r\n"Which means, did he purloin it?  Well, sir, we shall see.  An English\r\nbank-note can be traced.  That\'s one advantage you have over us on the\r\nother side."\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong during this short colloquy experienced a curious\r\ndepression of spirits.  He was thinking, not of the bank-notes, or the\r\nAmerican mayor, or even of Captain Oliphant, but of Rosalind and Jill\r\nand Tom; and the thought of them just at this moment made him feel very\r\nmelancholy.\r\n\r\nAs for the captain, if his thoughts for a moment turned in the same\r\ndirection, they came back instantly, with a strong revulsion of hate\r\nagainst the man who stood in his way at every turn; who seemed to read\r\nhim through, to unmask him silently whenever he sought to take refuge in\r\na lie, to pin him ruthlessly down to the consequences of his own\r\ndelinquencies.  But for Armstrong he might have been a free man--free of\r\nhis debts, free of his frauds, clear in his children\'s eyes, able to\r\nhold up his head to all the world.  As it was, everything seemed to\r\nconspire with his enemy to pinion him and hold him fast, a prey to the\r\nNemesis that was on its way!  What would he not give to have this\r\nstumbling-block out of the path, and feel himself free to breathe and\r\nhope once more?\r\n\r\nIn such a mood he spent the morning; and about midday, shaking off his\r\nvisitor, wandered out into the park for fresh air and space to think.\r\nAs he paced, there returned to him memories of old half-forgotten days,\r\nof faces that once looked into his trustfully, voices that once made his\r\nheart glad, children that once ran to welcome him; visions of vanished\r\nhopes, ambitions, ideals.  Where were they all now?  Who believed in him\r\nto-day?  Who would believe in him a week hence?  What voices rejoiced\r\nhim now?  Into whose life did he carry strength and cheer?  The park\r\nstretched bleak and desolate before him; the earth lay sullen under his\r\nfeet, the very trees drooped around him, and the great restless ocean\r\nbeyond moaned at his coming.  It was nothing to him that the smell of\r\nspring was in the air; that the lark was carolling high overhead; that\r\nthe declining sun was darting his rays through the trees.\r\n\r\nNear at hand rose a sound of laughter.  He durst not turn that way, lest\r\nhe should meet his own children.\r\n\r\nFar away, through a break in the trees, he could catch a glimpse of the\r\nold church at Yeld with the Vicarage beside it, where dwelt the one\r\nbeing he dreaded most--his own daughter.  From behind wafted a sound of\r\nmusic through an open window, where sat the man who had found him out\r\nand could ruin him by a word.\r\n\r\nWhich way was he to turn?  Which way shall a man turn who would escape\r\nfrom himself?\r\n\r\nFor two long hours he wandered on caring not which way he took, and\r\nfeeling himself step by step closer beset by his dismal forebodings.\r\nPresently he found himself beyond the park boundaries on the open downs\r\nwhich stretched to the edge of the cliff.  The touch of the salt sea-\r\nbreeze on his fevered brow startled him and made him shiver.  The last\r\ngleam of daylight was fading in the west, and when presently it\r\nflickered out and left him in the dark, he felt that the last ray of his\r\nown hope had vanished too.  And yet, strange as it may seem, this man\r\nhad never been quite as honest with himself as he was now.  The game was\r\nfairly up.  He had long since given up deluding himself that he was\r\nbetter than he seemed.  Now the time was come when it hardly seemed\r\nworth while to delude other people.  It was no use.  Nor, to such a pass\r\nhad he come, did it seem much use to be a coward.  The dog whose last\r\nhope has gone will gather himself together for a final fling at his\r\npersecutors; the poltroon driven back against the wall, unable to\r\nretreat farther, will sometimes turn and make a stand such as he never\r\ndeemed himself capable of before.  And so Captain Oliphant, because he\r\ncould do nothing else, plucked up a little courage and groped about in\r\nthe dark for some new fragments of his lost manhood.\r\n\r\nHe would go back and face the worst.  If he was to be ruined, he would\r\npull the mask off himself, and not leave it to Armstrong or any one else\r\nto do it.  Whatever befell, nothing could well be more wretched than the\r\nplight in which he now stood.  He had no amends to make, but he could at\r\nleast simplify the labours of those whose business it was to expose and\r\npunish him.  With which poor spark of resolution he turned dismally to\r\ngo back to Maxfield.\r\n\r\nAs he did so he became aware of footsteps close at hand on the cliff-\r\npath.  Whoever the passenger might be--at such an hour and place it was\r\nnot likely to be any one but a coastguard or a fisherman--Captain\r\nOliphant was in no mood for company.  He therefore stepped off the path\r\nand sat down on a seat on the edge of the cliff till the intruder had\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nIt was not so dark but that the latter perceived the movement, and\r\nhalting suddenly, said--\r\n\r\n"Who\'s that?"\r\n\r\nThe voice was that of Mr Ratman.  What brought him here at this moment,\r\nto extinguish, perhaps, the little gleam of courage that flickered in\r\nthe breast of his wretched dupe?\r\n\r\nFor a moment the captain was tempted to run like a thief from a\r\npoliceman; but his very desperation came to his rescue.\r\n\r\n"What do you want here, Ratman?"\r\n\r\n"Hullo, it\'s Oliphant!  Here\'s a piece of luck.  You\'re the very man I\r\nwanted to see.  I\'ve changed my mind since I said good-bye yesterday, my\r\nboy, and mean to remain here on the spot and see the end of this\r\nbusiness.  I was on my way to see you.  Come along."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better say what you want to say here.  You won\'t find any\r\nadmirers of yours up at the house."\r\n\r\n"Ah! then you\'ve heard of last night\'s business?  What on earth brings\r\nthis Yankee idiot here at this time to spoil everything?  Now, Teddy,\r\nthe long and short of this business is, that you must stir yourself.\r\nYou\'ve shuffled long enough.  First of all you were going to marry the\r\nwidow; you boggled that.  Then you were going to succeed to the\r\nproperty; you\'ve boggled that.  Then you were to clear the tutor out of\r\nthe way; you\'ve boggled that.  Then you were to raise the wind and pay\r\nme off, and you\'ve boggled that.  I\'ve given you long enough rope,\r\ngoodness knows.  I mean to haul in now."\r\n\r\nCaptain Oliphant rose from his seat with a dismal laugh.  "I\'m tired of\r\nhearing you say that, Ratman.  I wish you\'d do it and be done with it."\r\n\r\nRatman peered through the gloom at the speaker in surprise.  "Hullo!"\r\nsaid he, "that\'s a new tune for you.  Now look here; I suppose you\'ve\r\nnot forgotten our talk yesterday?"\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ve two things to do; you\'ve to recognise me as Roger Ingleton when\r\nthe time comes.  There\'ll be proofs and witnesses.  They must satisfy\r\nyou, mind.  Make no mistake of that.  Then I must have Rosalind.  I love\r\nher.  On the day I\'m your son-in-law you shall have back every bill I\r\nhold against you.  Now, is it a bargain?  It\'s a cheap one for you, I\r\ncan tell you."\r\n\r\nThe blood rose to Captain Oliphant\'s brow.  A few hours ago he would\r\nhave faltered and evaded, half whined, half promised; now sheer\r\ndesperation made him reckless.\r\n\r\nHe laughed bitterly.\r\n\r\n"Recognise you--you shark!  Never!  And if you ever dare to speak of my\r\ndaughter, I\'ll shake you like a cur.  There now, do as you like; you\'ve\r\ngot my answer."\r\n\r\nRatman dropped his jaw in utter amazement.  For a minute the words would\r\nnot come.  Then, with a face so livid that Oliphant could see its\r\nwhiteness through the night, he hissed--\r\n\r\n"You mean it?  You defy me?--me, with these papers in my hand, and the\r\nwhole story of your villainy in my keeping?  You--"\r\n\r\nAs he held up the bills a wild impulse prompted the wretched captain to\r\nmake a grab at them.\r\n\r\nThere was a short struggle.  Oliphant, with his back to the cliff, kept\r\nhis hold for a moment; then a fierce blow sent him reeling backwards to\r\nthe edge, with the torn half of the documents in his hand.  There was a\r\ngasp, a half cry, and next moment only one man stood in the place,\r\npeering with ashen face into the black darkness below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nTHE BILLIARD-MARKER AT "L\'HOTEL SOULT."\r\n\r\nIn the _salon_ of a small dilapidated hotel in one of the southern\r\nsuburbs of Paris sat Roger, three weeks after the event recorded in the\r\nlast chapter.  He had the dull place, apparently, to himself.  The\r\nbilliard-room, visible through the folding-doors, was deserted.  In the\r\ndining-room the waiter dozed undisturbed by a single guest.  The\r\nlandlady in her _bureau_ yawned and hummed, and had not even a bill to\r\nmake out.\r\n\r\nShe had already made out that of the young English gentleman, and a\r\npretty one it was!  A guest such as he was worth a season to the\r\nlandlady of "L\'Hotel Soult."  Three weeks ago, half dead with cold and\r\nweariness, he had come and asked for a bed; and in that bed till\r\nyesterday he had remained, feverish, coughing, sometimes gasping for\r\nbreath.  Compared with the attack he had had in London in the winter,\r\nthis was a mild one; but in this dreary place, with not a friend at\r\nhand, with a doctor who could not understand a word he said, with a\r\nvoluble landlady who, when she visited him, never gave him a chance of\r\ngetting in a word, and with a few servants who stared at him blankly\r\nwhenever he attempted to lift his voice, it was the most miserable of\r\nall his illnesses.\r\n\r\nHe was as close a prisoner as if he had been in jail.  The doctor, who\r\ntook apartments at his expense in the hotel, would not allow him to\r\nmove.  No one to whom he appealed could be made to understand that he\r\nhad friends in England with whom he desired to communicate.  One letter\r\nto Armstrong which he had tried to write the landlady impounded and\r\ndestroyed as waste-paper, perhaps not quite by accident.  This well-to-\r\ndo young guest was worth nursing.  His friends would only come and fetch\r\nhim away; whereas she, motherly soul! was prepared to take him in and do\r\nfor him.  The pocket of the coat which on the day of his arrival she had\r\ncarried off to her kitchen to dry contained satisfactory proof that\r\nMonsieur was a young gentleman who could pay; and although she was too\r\nhonest to recoup herself for her services in advance, she had kept the\r\ncoat hanging up in her room for a week, as a pleasant reminder of the\r\njoys of hospitality.\r\n\r\nOnly yesterday the invalid had recovered sufficiently to rout the doctor\r\nand stagger down to the telegraph-office; and to-day, propped up with\r\npillows on the uncomfortable stuff-sofa, he was expiating his rashness\r\nwith a day of miserable coughing.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of his handbell, the landlady, a buxom dame of forty-five\r\nautumns, hastened to the couch of her profitable visitor.\r\n\r\nRoger was too weak to oppose the flood of her congratulations and\r\ncompliments on his recovery, and allowed her to talk herself breathless\r\nbefore he put in his word.\r\n\r\n"Madame has not been many years in these parts?" he inquired in his best\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nMadame threw up her shoulders and protested she had lived in those parts\r\nfrom a child, when the dull suburb was once a festive little rustic\r\nvillage, and the great city now gobbling it up once loomed mysteriously\r\nin the north, with acres and miles of green fields and woods between.\r\n\r\n"But this hotel," said Roger, "has not stood here so long?"\r\n\r\n"_Ma foi_!" said she, "since I can remember, when I used to visit my\r\ngood uncle here every Sunday, I remember `L\'Hotel Soult.\'  Why, when I\r\nmarried my cousin and became _Madame l\'hotesse_, it was all fields\r\nbetween us and Paris.  Yes, and little enough change about the house.\r\nWe cannot afford, Monsieur, to build and decorate.  By a miracle we\r\nescaped the German shells.  Ah! a merry time was the year of the war!\r\nFrance suffered, alas! but the `L\'Hotel Soult\' prospered.  \'Twas the\r\nyear I was left a widow!  I had ten waiters then, Monsieur, and two\r\nbilliard-markers, a _chef_ from the best kitchen in Paris, and stables,\r\nand _chambrieres_, and--why, Monsieur, the wages of one week were\r\ntwenty--twenty-five napoleons!"\r\n\r\n"That was after the war?" asked Roger.\r\n\r\n"Yes.  Before that I had more.  But, alas! they left me for the field,\r\nand came no more."\r\n\r\n"Were all your waiters Frenchmen?" asked Roger.\r\n\r\nMadame stared curiously at the questioner.\r\n\r\n"Why do you ask?  I have had many kinds.  Some English, like Monsieur."\r\n\r\n"A year or two after the war," said Roger, "there was an Englishman, a\r\nrelation of mine, who was a waiter in an hotel in one of the suburbs\r\nsouth of Paris.  I want to hear of him.  I have hunted for weeks.  I\r\ncould hear nothing of him.  I came here before I gave it up as a\r\nhopeless search, and, as you know, I\'ve been laid up ever since.  You\r\nhave been kind to me, Madame; something makes me think I was not kept\r\nhere for nothing.  Can you help me to find my friend?"\r\n\r\nThe landlady began to have inward misgivings that she had not behaved to\r\nthis pleasant-spoken young guest of hers as nicely as she might have\r\ndone, and she secretly resolved to revise the bill in his favour before\r\npresenting it.\r\n\r\n"Why, Monsieur, I had plenty English in my time.  The year after the war\r\nI had--let me think--two or three.  Your friend--was he the little lame\r\none who waited beautiful at table, but that he cough, cough, till I must\r\nsend him away?"\r\n\r\n"No; that\'s not the one."\r\n\r\n"Then it was the fat one?--John Bull, we call him, who eat more than he\r\nserved, never used a fork when he had his fingers.  Ah, he was a dirty\r\none, was your friend!"\r\n\r\n"No," said Roger; "that\'s not he.  My friend was not much older than I\r\nam, and a gentleman."\r\n\r\n"A gentleman--and a waiter!" laughed the landlady.  "But tell me, what\r\nwas his name?"\r\n\r\n"He used to call himself Rogers."\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n"No one of that name was here.  I had English, one or two--Bardsley, and\r\nJackson, and Smith; he was a gentleman, but he was not young.  He was\r\nfifty years, Mr Smith--a good servant.  Also there was Monsieur\r\nCallow."\r\n\r\n"Callot!" exclaimed Roger, starting at the familiar name.  "Was he an\r\nEnglishman?"\r\n\r\n"Surely.  C-a-l-l-o-w--Callow.  Ah! he was a droll one, was Monsieur\r\nCallow, and a gentleman too.  I never had a billiard-marker like him.\r\nHe could play any man, and lose by one point; and he could recite and\r\nsing; and oh, he eat so little!  Every one laughed at him; but he\r\nlaughed little himself, and thought himself too good for his fellow-\r\nwaiters."\r\n\r\n"What was he like?" asked Roger, flushing with excitement.\r\n\r\n"A fine young man, with long curly hair, and whiskers and a beard.  He\r\nwas afraid of nothing, tall and strong.  Ah me!  I have seen him knock a\r\nman down at a blow.  He was a wild, reckless man, was Monsieur Callow;\r\nbut a good servant, and oh! a beautiful billiard player.  He always knew\r\nhow to lose a game, and oh! it made my table so popular!"\r\n\r\n"Had he any friends in Paris?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; he went often to see his father--so he told me--an actor who gave\r\nlessons.  I never saw _Monsieur le pere_."\r\n\r\n"How long did he stay with you?"\r\n\r\n"Callow?  For five years he served me well.  Then there was a _fracas_,\r\na quarrel; I remember it now.  An English officer was here, and played\r\nwith him, and was beaten.  \'Twas the only time I ever knew Callow win a\r\ngame; but he lost his temper this time, and won.  Then Milord called him\r\na cheat, and without a word Monsieur Callow knocked him down.  The\r\npolice came, and Monsieur Callow knocked _him_ down.  Then he put on his\r\nhat and walked, and I never saw him more.  He always said he would go to\r\nsea, and I think he would keep his word.  Ah, a telegram!  \'Tis long\r\nsince telegrams came to my hotel.  _Helas_! not for me; for you,\r\nMonsieur."\r\n\r\nIt was from Armstrong.\r\n\r\n"Shall be with you, ten to-morrow morning."\r\n\r\nThe three weeks which had passed at Maxfield had been terrible.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of Captain Oliphant\'s body at the foot of the cliff, with\r\nthe clear traces of a struggle on the brink above, had created a\r\nprofound sensation at Maxfield and the country round.\r\n\r\nFor a day the air was full of wild conjectures of suicide, incident,\r\nfoul play; until the last-named theory was finally confirmed by the\r\ndiscovery in the tightly-clenched hand of the dead man of a fragment of\r\na promissory note bearing the signature of Robert Ratman.\r\n\r\nTo the tutor, as he held the paper in his hand, everything became\r\nstartlingly clear.  This was the last act of a tragedy which had been\r\ngoing on for months; and now that the curtain had abruptly fallen, he\r\ncould not help, in the midst of this horror, owning to a sense of\r\nthankfulness, for the sake of others, that the troubled career of his\r\nrival and enemy had stopped short at a point beyond which nothing but\r\ndisgrace and scandal and misery awaited it.\r\n\r\nFrom that disgrace it was his business now, by every means in his power,\r\nto shield the innocent brother and sisters who still honoured the dead\r\nman as their father.\r\n\r\nMany a grievous task had been thrown upon the tutor in his day, but none\r\ncost him more effort than this, of breaking to the children of his enemy\r\nthe news of their father\'s death.  But he went through it manfully and\r\nably.\r\n\r\nRosalind, on whom the blow fell hardest, because on her spirit the\r\nburden of her father\'s cares had lain heaviest, rose, with a heroine\'s\r\ncourage, to the occasion, and earned the tutor\'s boundless gratitude by\r\nmaking his task easy.  She said little; she understood everything.  She\r\nremembered nothing but the father\'s love--his old caresses and\r\nconfidences and kindnesses.  The tears she shed blotted out all the\r\nanxieties and misgivings and heart-sinkings of recent weeks.  All that\r\nremained was crowded with love.\r\n\r\nTom, dulled and stunned, took the story in gradually, and got used to it\r\nas he went along.  He came and slept at night in the tutor\'s room, and\r\nfelt how much worse things might have been had it not been for the\r\nstalwart protector who put hope and cheer into him, and filled the blank\r\nin his heart with sturdier views of life than the boy had ever harboured\r\nthere before.\r\n\r\nAs for Jill, for a week all was blackness and darkness to her.  She felt\r\ndeserted--lost.  She cried herself to sleep at night, and by day\r\nwandered over the house, peeping into her father\'s room, and half\r\nexpecting to see him back.  Then her gentle spirit took courage, and she\r\nlooked up, and her eyes lit with comfort and hope on Mr Armstrong.\r\nEverything could not be lost if he was there; and when he sometimes\r\ncame, and took her little hand in his, and invited her to be his\r\ncompanion in his rides, or sought her out in her lonely walks and made\r\nher teach him the haunts of her favourite flowers or read to him from\r\nher favourite books, she began to think there was still some joy left on\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n"Dear Mr Armstrong," she said one day when, by invitation, she came to\r\nmake afternoon tea for him in his room, "you are so awfully kind to me!\r\nIf I was only as old as Rosalind, I would marry you."\r\n\r\nThis rather startling declaration took the tutor considerably aback.  He\r\nlaughed and said--\r\n\r\n"You are very nice as you are, Jill."\r\n\r\n"You think I\'m silly, I know," said she, "but I\'m not.  Would you hate\r\nme if I was older?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I could hate you, not even if you were a hundred."\r\n\r\n"I love you ever so much," said she.  "Please don\'t believe what Tom\r\nsaid about the Duke.  I don\'t like him a millionth part as much as you."\r\n\r\n"Poor Duke!" said the tutor.\r\n\r\n"Really and truly.  And oh, Mr Armstrong, if you would only wait I\r\nwould love to marry you some day!  How soon shall I be big enough?"\r\n\r\nThis was getting embarrassing.  But the tutor was in a tender mood, and\r\nhad it not in his heart to thwart the little Leap-year maid.  "Time\r\nflies fast," said he; "you\'ll be grown up before we know where we all\r\nare."\r\n\r\nShe sighed.\r\n\r\n"I know you\'d sooner have Rosalind.  But she doesn\'t care for you as\r\nmuch as I do.  She likes Roger best; but I don\'t; I like you fifty\r\nthousand times better.  Would it be an _awful_ bother, Mr Armstrong?"\r\n\r\n"What! to have Jill for my little wife?" said he.  "Not a bit.  If ever\r\nI want one, she\'s the first person I mean to ask."\r\n\r\nWith this declaration Jill had to rest content.  It solaced her sorrow\r\nvastly; and even though Rosalind, to whom she confided the compact under\r\na pledge of secrecy, scolded and laughed at her alternately, she felt a\r\nnew prospect open before her, and set herself resolutely to the task of\r\ngrowing up worthy of Mr\r\n\r\nArmstrong\'s affection.\r\n\r\nBut amid all these troubles and hopes at Maxfield, two questions were on\r\nevery one\'s lips: "Where was Roger?  Where was Robert Ratman?"\r\n\r\nRoger had written once after reaching Paris, a letter full of hope,\r\nwhich had arrived a few days before Captain Oliphant\'s death.  He had\r\nsucceeded at last in tracking the man Pantalzar to a low lodging in the\r\ncity, and from him had ascertained somewhat of the history of the Callot\r\nfamily.  They had lodged with him at Long Street in London, where they\r\nhad given lessons in acting, elocution, and music; and Pantalzar clearly\r\nremembered the lad Rogers as a constant visitor at the house, partly in\r\nthe capacity of a promising student of the dramatic art, and partly as a\r\nhopeless lover of his preceptor\'s wayward daughter.\r\n\r\nAfter a year, his troubles in the latter capacity were abruptly cut\r\nshort by the illness and death of the young lady; a blow which staggered\r\nthe parents and broke up the establishment at Long Street.  It failed,\r\nhowever, to drive Rogers from the party, who, with a romantic loyalty,\r\nattached himself to the fortunes of the old people, and became like a\r\nson to them in their distresses.\r\n\r\nEventually the bereaved family migrated to Paris, whence Pantalzar had\r\nonce heard from the father, who had found employment as stall manager of\r\na third-rate theatre in one of the _fauxbourg_.  Hither Roger tracked\r\nhim, and after dogged search, often baffled, sometimes apparently\r\nhopeless, discovered some one who remembered the reputed son of the old\r\ncouple, who, as far as this witness could remember, was thought to have\r\nhired himself out as billiard-marker in an hotel in one of the southern\r\nsuburbs of the city.\r\n\r\nThus far he had succeeded when he wrote home.  What transpired\r\nsubsequently, and how he dropped for a season out of all knowledge, the\r\nreader already knows.\r\n\r\nThe suspense occasioned by his sudden disappearance, as may be imagined,\r\nadded a new element of wretchedness to the situation at Maxfield.\r\nTelegrams, letters, inquiries, alike failed to discover his whereabouts\r\nor the secret of his silence.  As post after post came and brought\r\nneither message nor tidings, the hearts of the watchers grew sick.  To\r\nthe tutor especially, tied as he was to the scene of the tragedy, those\r\nthree weeks were a period of torture.  He urged Dr Brandram to go over\r\nto Paris to make inquiries; but the Doctor, after a fortnight of\r\nfruitless search, returned empty-handed.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong thereupon resolved at all hazards to quit his post and go\r\nhimself.  He knew something of Paris.  He had old associations with the\r\ncity, and once, as the reader has heard, possessed acquaintances there.\r\nIf any one could find the boy, he thought he could; and with such trusty\r\nsubstitutes as the Doctor and Mr Headland, who remained at Yeld, to\r\nleave behind, he felt that he might, nay rather that he must, venture on\r\nthe journey.\r\n\r\nIt was on the morning of his departure, as he was waiting for the trap\r\nto carry him to the station, that Roger\'s telegram was put in his\r\nhand:--\r\n\r\n"Come--have been ill--better now--Hotel Soult--no news."\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours later the tutor was at his pupil\'s side, with a heavy\r\nweight lifted from his heart, and resolved, come what would, not to quit\r\nhis post till he had the truant safe back at Maxfield.\r\n\r\nThe news he brought with him served to drive from Roger\'s mind all\r\nthoughts of continuing his sojourn a day longer than was necessary to\r\nrecover his strength.\r\n\r\n"It seems pretty certain," said he, "that my brother, when he left here,\r\nreturned to England, and probably went to sea very soon after.  There is\r\nno object in staying here.  Look in that room there, Armstrong.  That\'s\r\nthe billiard-room in which he spent most of his time, and that\'s the\r\nvery table on which he let himself be beaten regularly for the good of\r\nthe house."\r\n\r\nThe tutor walked across to the folding-doors and surveyed the dingy room\r\nwith critical interest.\r\n\r\n"And that must have been little more than twelve years ago," said he.\r\n"Do you still hold to your theory that Ratman is your brother?"\r\n\r\n"I have no theory.  I must find my brother, even if he is a--a\r\nmurderer," said the boy with a groan.  "But, I say, has nothing been\r\nheard of him?"\r\n\r\n"The police have traced him to London; there the scent ends for the\r\npresent.  He is probably in hiding there, and one may have to wait weeks\r\nor months till he gets off his guard and is caught."\r\n\r\nAbout ten days later they started, by slow stages, on the homeward\r\njourney.  Whether Madame received all she expected for her hospitality\r\nis doubtful.  Mr Armstrong undertook the duties of cashier, and used\r\nhis eye-glass considerably in scrutinising the figures.  He craved an\r\ninterview with Madame in her parlour to discuss her arithmetic, and\r\nalthough he appeared eventually to arrive at a satisfactory\r\nunderstanding with the good lady (so much so, that she shed tears at his\r\ndeparture), he did not complain that her charges were extortionate, as\r\nFrench hotels go.\r\n\r\nThe home-coming of the heir of Maxfield created a welcome flutter of\r\nexcitement among the desolate occupants of the manor-house and their\r\nneighbours.  But the flutter in their hearts was nothing compared with\r\nthat in the heart of the heir himself as he walked across the park on\r\nthe day after his return to call at the Vicarage and invite Rosalind to\r\naccompany him in a ride.  What passed--whether the flutter was\r\ncontagious, what brought back the deserted colour to Miss Rosalind\'s\r\ncheeks, why they rode so slow and left so much of their course to the\r\ndecision of their steeds,--all this and many other matters for wonder,\r\nhistory recordeth not, as is quite proper.  But it does record that\r\nwhen, on their return, Mr Armstrong chanced to come out on to the door-\r\nstep, where the two stood unmounted, Roger said--\r\n\r\n"Armstrong, Rosalind has promised to be my wife."\r\n\r\nThe tutor flushed a little at this not unexpected announcement; then\r\ntaking his pupil\'s arm, he said--\r\n\r\n"It means great happiness for you both.  I am glad--very glad."\r\n\r\nBut why, if he was so glad, did he slink off to his study forthwith and\r\nplay a dirge on his piano, and there sit listlessly in his chair for the\r\nrest of the morning staring out of the window through his glass, till\r\nJill tripped in and fetched him down to lunch, saying--\r\n\r\n"Dear Mr Armstrong, try not to be too awfully sorry.  _I_ think no one\r\nis as nice as you."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHE HEIR OF MAXFIELD COMES OF AGE.\r\n\r\nIt wanted but a month to Roger\'s majority, that important day on which\r\nthe fate of so many persons was to be decided, when a letter was\r\ndelivered to the heir of Maxfield as he sat at breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe weeks that had passed since Captain Oliphant\'s sudden death had been\r\nuneventful.  To Rosalind and Roger the discovery that they loved one\r\nanother went far to lighten the sorrow which had befallen both--one in\r\nthe death of a father, the other in what appeared to be the hopeless\r\nloss of a brother.\r\n\r\nRoger had by no means yet abandoned his search.  Twice already had he\r\nand Armstrong been up to London to make inquiries, but without avail.\r\nThe billiard-marker of "L\'Hotel Soult" had vanished as completely as--\r\nwell, as Mr Ratman.\r\n\r\n"You know, of course," said the tutor once, with the rather\r\nunsympathetic drawl in which he was wont to allude to the lost\r\nIngleton--"you know, of course, that if the man you want is Ratman, you\r\nare having the assistance of the police in your search.  A warrant is\r\nout against him, and heaven and earth is being moved to capture him."\r\n\r\nRoger sighed.\r\n\r\n"I am looking for no one but my brother," said he, "Even if he turns out\r\nto be this miscreant, I cannot help it."\r\n\r\n"Quite so.  Only it is right to remember that to find Ratman means to\r\nhang him.  That at least is the object the police have in view.  But you\r\nneed not disturb yourself on that score.  Roger Ingleton, major, if we\r\nfind him, may be a villain, but he won\'t be the murderer of Miss\r\nOliphant\'s father."\r\n\r\nThey returned presently, baffled, to Maxfield.  No one at the depots, or\r\nrecruiting head-quarters, or pension offices could tell them a word of a\r\nsoldier or a sailor named Callot who might have enlisted or gone to sea\r\nabout twelve years ago.  How could they expect it?  Nor did the most\r\ncareful search among the old Squire\'s papers lead to the discovery of\r\nany record of the supposed report of the lad\'s death.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, if the billiard-marker at "L\'Hotel Soult" was the\r\nman, they had already traced him down to a date long subsequent to that\r\nof his rumoured death.\r\n\r\nTogether they ransacked the memories of Dr Brandram, the Vicar, old\r\nHodder, and one or two other inhabitants who might be supposed to know\r\nsomething of the matter.  Very few there were who had seen the boy at\r\nall.  He had spent most of his time at school, and during his occasional\r\nholidays had usually found all the amusement he needed in the ample\r\nconfines of the park.\r\n\r\nNo one had seen in black and white an announcement of his death.  The\r\nSquire had told the Doctor that news of it had arrived from abroad;\r\nwhere and when and under what circumstances he never said.  Old Hodder\r\nremembered the story of the quarrel between father and son, and\r\nidentified the portrait as that of the missing lad.  But, despite his\r\nboasted "threescore years and ten," the old man was absolutely useless\r\nin the present inquiry.\r\n\r\nAnd so, thwarted at every turn, not knowing what to hope for, too proud\r\nto own himself beaten, Roger abandoned the search, and awaited his\r\nmajority very much as a debtor awaits his bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong, who chanced to look up at the moment when Raffles\r\ndelivered the letter, concluded at once from the startled look on the\r\nlad\'s face that it was a missive of no common importance.\r\n\r\nIt was from Ratman, and bore on its envelope the London post-mark:--\r\n\r\n  "Dear Brother,--For the last time I claim your help.  I know quite\r\n  well that I am being hunted to death by you and those you employ.\r\n  Without a shred of evidence you are willing to believe me a murderer.\r\n  I suppose I have no right to complain.  It would be convenient to you\r\n  to have me out of the way, and the best way of getting rid of me is to\r\n  get up this cry against me.  A nice brotherly act, and worthy of an\r\n  Ingleton!  It is no use my telling you that I am innocent--that till I\r\n  had been two days here I never so much as heard of Oliphant\'s death.\r\n  You would not believe it.  Nor, I fancy, is it much use telling you\r\n  that the scoundrel owed me money, that I was shielding him from the\r\n  consequences of an old felony for which he might have had penal\r\n  servitude, and that the little he did pay me was stolen from your\r\n  property.  Of course you wouldn\'t believe it.  It is only about your\r\n  brother, who has been a slung stone all his life, who never had a\r\n  friend, never knew a kind look from any one, that you are ready to\r\n  believe evil.  I am nearly at the end of my tether here.  In a day or\r\n  two you will probably hear that I am arrested, and then you will have\r\n  your revenge on me for daring to be your flesh and blood; and you will\r\n  have no difficulty in convincing a judge and jury that I have\r\n  committed any crime you and your saintly tutor choose to concoct\r\n  between you.  Pleasant to be rich and influential!  I could escape if\r\n  I had money.  Fifty pounds would rid you of me almost as effectively\r\n  as the gallows.  But it would cost you something; therefore it is\r\n  absurd to imagine it possible.  When, three days hence, I make my last\r\n  call at the General Post Office, and hear once more that there is\r\n  nothing for me, not even a message of brotherly pity (which costs\r\n  nothing), I shall know my last hope is gone.  And you, in the lap of\r\n  luxury, counting your thousands, and monarch of all you survey, will\r\n  be able to breathe again.  Either you will hear of my arrest, or, if\r\n  my courage befriends me, you may read in an obscure corner of the\r\n  paper of a wretch, hounded to death, who escaped his pursuers after\r\n  all, and preferred to die by his own hand rather than that of his\r\n  brother.  Good-bye till then.\r\n\r\n  "Your brother,--\r\n\r\n  "Roger Ingleton.\r\n\r\n  "_P.S_.--The Post Office know me, or my messenger, as `Richard\r\n  Redfern.\'  No doubt you will show this letter to your tutor, who\r\n  should have no difficulty in using the information I am obliged to\r\n  give as to my whereabouts to run me down."\r\n\r\nThe flush on Roger\'s face had died down into pallor by the time he\r\nreached the end of this savage yet dismal letter.  Till he came to the\r\npostscript he had reckoned on demanding Armstrong\'s advice as to its\r\ncontents.  Now, somehow, his hands seemed tied.  Here was a man,\r\nclaiming to be his brother, practically placing his life in his hands.\r\nWhether the story were true or false, the writer had calculated astutely\r\non the quixotic temper of his correspondent.  The appeal, insultingly as\r\nit was made, was one which Roger Ingleton, minor, could not resist.\r\n\r\n"I have had a letter from Ratman," said he when the two friends were\r\nalone together.\r\n\r\n"I am not surprised," said the tutor.  "He wants money, of course?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t show you the letter, simply because it contains a vague clue as\r\nto his whereabouts, which you would feel bound to follow up."\r\n\r\n"I undoubtedly should," said Mr Armstrong.  "Shall not you?"\r\n\r\n"No.  He gives it in confidence, in the hope I shall send him money.  I\r\ndon\'t intend to do that, but it would hardly be fair to use this letter\r\nagainst him."\r\n\r\n"He is Captain Oliphant\'s murderer."\r\n\r\n"He denies it, and once more calls himself my brother."\r\n\r\nThe tutor shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"As you please.  Burn the letter.  It probably does not tell more than\r\nthe police know already."\r\n\r\nRoger dismally obeyed.  Had he felt sure that this man was his brother,\r\nhe would have, at all risk and in spite of all, tried to help him.  Even\r\nso, to help him with one hand would mean to ruin him with the other.  If\r\nhe found him, it would be to hand him over to the police.  If he\r\nprocured his escape, it would be to oust him irrevocably from his\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\nThere seemed nothing for it but to do nothing and wait.\r\n\r\nIn other quarters the policy of inaction found little favour.  Mr\r\nHeadland called up the same evening at Maxfield and demanded an\r\ninterview with the tutor.\r\n\r\n"Wal, young man," said he, "I calculate those two hundred-pound notes of\r\nmine didn\'t travel so far astray after all."\r\n\r\n"You have traced them, then?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been three weeks doing it, but I have so."\r\n\r\n"And with what conclusion?"\r\n\r\n"Just this, that Captain E.  Oliphant fell over that cliff just about\r\nthe right time, sir.  Yes, sir, my notes are lying snug at the English\r\nBank at this present moment, and I know their pedigree.  Number 90,356\r\ncame there from a bank in Fleet Street.  The bank in Fleet Street\r\nreceived it from a hotel.  The hotel received it from a gentleman who\r\nslept in bedroom Number 36, and that gentleman\'s name was Ratman.\r\nNumber 90,357 came to the bank later from Amsterdam.  Amsterdam had it\r\nfrom an English diamond merchant, the diamond merchant had it from a\r\nstock jobber, and the stock jobber had it from a sporting club, who had\r\nit from a temporary member in December last in payment of a gambling\r\ndebt, and that temporary member\'s name was Ratman.  That\'s not all, sir.\r\nMy letter was posted in America, November 9.  On November 17 the post-\r\nmaster at Yeld, an intelligent man, sir, received a letter with an\r\nAmerican stamp, sir, addressed to Roger Ingleton, senior, at Maxfield.\r\nA Yankee stamp was a novelty to your intelligent post-master, and he\r\ntook a note of date, and sent it up here for delivery.  It was delivered\r\nhere November 17, and your footman remembers giving it to your\r\ncolleague.  Three days after, Mr Ratman visited his friend Captain E.\r\nOliphant here.  Two days later he reached the hotel in London with a\r\nYeld label on his trunk.  A week after that he passed note Number 90,356\r\nto settle his bill.  There, sir; the Americans are born explorers.  I\r\nflatter myself there\'s not much more to know about my two notes."\r\n\r\n"Quite so," said the tutor.  "You have done a great deal in three weeks.\r\nWhat reparation can be made you?"\r\n\r\n"Sir, you are an honest young man.  You believe in shielding the memory\r\nof a dead enemy.  You are right.  Continue on that tack and you\'ll do\r\nyourself credit.  As executor of my late kinsman, I will trouble you to\r\nplace this cheque for L200 to the credit of the estate, and never to say\r\na word about the sum that was lost.  Notes get lost every day; at least\r\nthey do in America."\r\n\r\nMr Armstrong\'s gratitude was beyond words.  He had set his heart, for\r\nthe sake of the children of his late colleague, and even for Roger\'s\r\nsake, on covering with a cloak of oblivion the crime of which chance had\r\nmade him the detector.  This American had it in his power to aid or\r\nthwart him, and had chosen the former course; and a great weight was\r\nlifted off the tutor\'s mind in consequence.\r\n\r\nOn the following day he was calling at the Yeld bank to transact some\r\nbusiness (part of which was to pay in Mr Headland\'s cheque), when the\r\nmanager invited him into his parlour.  This functionary was a\r\nrespectable, middle-aged person, who had held his appointment for five\r\nor six years, keeping pretty much to himself, and, as is the lot of bank\r\nmanagers, being made a great deal of by clients who chanced to be, or\r\ndesired to be, under obligations to his bank.\r\n\r\n"Mr Armstrong," said he, "you will pardon me, but there\'s a little\r\nmatter--"\r\n\r\n"Hullo!" thought the tutor, "has the bank stopped payment, or the\r\nMaxfield securities been robbed?"\r\n\r\n"Well, sir?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a private matter, and I should not mention it if it were not for\r\nthe talk which is going to and fro about young Mr Ingleton\'s lost\r\nbrother.  I understand there\'s a claimant for the title, and not a very\r\neligible one."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, most ineligible," said the tutor.  "And it seems\r\nlikely that he will, under present circumstances, keep far enough away\r\nfrom these parts?"\r\n\r\n"Naturally.  The coroner\'s jury have given him a pressing invitation,\r\nwhich he feels compelled to decline."\r\n\r\n"Well, about this lost boy.  You\'ll think me impertinent, but I think I\r\ncan tell you something about him."\r\n\r\nThe tutor started, and looked hard at the speaker.  "Yes," said the\r\nlatter mildly.  "As you know, I\'ve not been here long.  My predecessor,\r\nMr Morris, was a friend of the family.  I remember his once mentioning\r\nan elder son of the Squire who had been reported dead, and that was all\r\nI ever heard of the matter from him or anybody else.  But only last\r\nweek, in a bundle of documents relating to Mr Morris\'s own affairs,\r\nwhich, as his executor, it was my duty to examine, I came upon a letter\r\nwhich, though evidently private at the time, seems as if it ought at\r\nleast to be seen by you and your ward now.  It proves that ten years ago\r\nthe elder son was alive, and being in his handwriting, it may be\r\nimportant evidence if you have to deal with the claim of an impostor."\r\n\r\nThe tutor expressed considerable discomfort at this new complication,\r\nand regarded the document in the banker\'s hand as if it were an infernal\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n"It\'s private, you say.  Would it not be better to regard it as such?"\r\n\r\n"I think it should be seen.  If you prefer I will submit it to Mr\r\nPottinger."\r\n\r\nThis settled the business.  The tutor stretched out his hand for the\r\nletter.  It was dated from on board the ship "Cyclops," off Havana, ten\r\nyears ago, and, by the unsteady character of the handwriting, which\r\nrendered some words almost illegible, had evidently been written in a\r\nhigh sea.  Mr Armstrong could scarcely help smiling at the banker\'s\r\nnaive suggestion as to the use of the document as evidence of\r\nhandwriting.\r\n\r\nThe note was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  "Dear Mr Morris,--I write to you in strictest confidence.  My father\r\n  probably has given me up for dead.  I hope so.  On no account must he\r\n  know that I have written to you.  My object is to enclose a twenty-\r\n  five dollar note which I owe him.  Once, before we quarrelled, he lent\r\n  me five pounds.  I want to pay it back without any one knowing of it,\r\n  because I\'m determined not to owe anything to anybody, especially to\r\n  one who has told me I\'m not honest.  Please put it into his bank\r\n  account.  He probably will never notice it; anyhow, please, whatever\r\n  you do, don\'t tell him or any one alive where it came from, or that\r\n  you ever heard a word from me or of me.  I trust you as a gentleman.\r\n\r\n  "Yours truly,--\r\n\r\n  "Roger Ingleton."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," said the banker, who had watched the reading curiously,\r\n"does it not seem an important letter?"\r\n\r\n"I think so.  It appears to be genuine, too, on the face of it.  If you\r\nwill allow me I should like my ward to see it.  It will interest him."\r\n\r\nThe tutor was not wrong.  With this strange missive in his hand all\r\nRoger\'s yearnings towards his lost brother returned in full force.  The\r\nobject of his search seemed suddenly to stand within measurable reach.\r\nTen years appeared nothing beside the twenty which only a few months\r\nback had divided them.  If he could but postpone his majority another\r\nyear!  Then came the miserable doubt about Ratman.  If, after all, his\r\nunlikely, discredited story should prove to have a grain of truth at the\r\nbottom of it!  But he dismissed the doubt for the hope.\r\n\r\n"Armstrong, I must go to town to find out about the `Cyclops.\'  Come\r\nwith me, there\'s a good fellow.  In three weeks it will be too late."\r\n\r\nThe tutor was prepared for this decision.\r\n\r\n"By all means," said he.  "We will go to-morrow to inquire after a\r\npassenger or sailor who was on board a sailing-vessel, nationality\r\nunknown, which happened to be off Havana in a heavy sea on October 20,\r\nten years ago."\r\n\r\n"I know it\'s absurd," said Roger, "but I can\'t help it.  I never seemed\r\nso near my brother before.  I should despise myself if I sat idle here."\r\n\r\nSo it happened that, just when Maxfield was preparing in a quiet way to\r\ncelebrate the coming of age of the heir; just as the gloom which had\r\nfollowed on Captain Oliphant\'s tragic death was beginning to lift a\r\nlittle and allow Tom and Jill decorously to think of football; just as\r\nRosalind was beginning to make up her mind that she was not destined for\r\never to teach the elements of art and science to the Vicarage children;\r\njust when everything seemed to be settling down for the last scene of\r\nthe drama, Roger and his tutor vanished once more on their familiar\r\nwild-goose chase.\r\n\r\nDr Brandram grumbled; the county gentry shook their heads; Mr\r\nPottinger breathed again.  No one thought well of the expedition; some\r\nwent so far as to make a jest of it.\r\n\r\nRoger cared nothing for what people thought.  With Armstrong to back\r\nhim, with Rosalind to bid him a brave God-speed, with his own stout\r\nheart to buoy him up, and with his lost brother only ten years distant,\r\nhe could afford to start in good cheer, and let the world think what it\r\nliked.\r\n\r\nBut the cheer was destined to failure.  They heard of one or two vessels\r\ncalled the "Cyclops," but respecting the crew or passengers, of none of\r\nthem was it possible to glean a word of news.  The vessel in question\r\nmight have been ship, schooner, or barque; she might have been English,\r\nAmerican, Indian, or Australian; she might have foundered, or changed\r\nher name, or been broken up for lumber.  Lloyds knew her not.  West\r\nIndia merchants had never heard of her.  Of all their quests, this\r\nseemed the most vague and hopeless.\r\n\r\nUp to the last, Roger stuck doggedly to it.  Even if he spent his\r\nmajority in the London docks he would not turn tail.  The tutor backed\r\nup loyally, did most of the work, made most of the inquiries, never\r\ngrumbled or gibed or protested.  When Roger looked most like giving in,\r\nit was the tutor who put fresh heart into him.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow," said Roger on the eve of his birthday, "I will give it up.\r\nBut there is a day yet."\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough, on the last day, a vague ray of light came in the shape\r\nof a telegram from the port-master at Havana, to whom, at the tutor\'s\r\nsuggestion, a message of inquiry had been sent:--\r\n\r\n  "_Cyclops known.  Writing_."\r\n\r\nWriting!  A letter would take weeks to come, and they had but a day!\r\nThey hurried to the telegraph-office and sent an urgent message begging\r\nparticulars by wire whatever the cost.  Late that day, indeed it was\r\nnearly midnight, the reply came:--\r\n\r\n  "_Sailed Ceylon, West Indies.  Name Ingleton unknown.  Ship now\r\n  here_."\r\n\r\nRoger staggered from the office a beaten man.  Through the deserted City\r\nstreets the clocks were booming the hour of midnight and ushering in his\r\nmajority.  His brother!  All along he had persuaded himself this quest\r\nwas to end in victory, that before now he should have met his brother\r\nface to face and given him what was his.  To-day it was no longer his to\r\ngive.  The race was already over, and the clock had won.  His brother\r\nwas not there.\r\n\r\n"Take my arm, dear old fellow," said Mr Armstrong, "and cheer up."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SIX.\r\n\r\nMISSING LINKS.\r\n\r\nFor three hours that night the two friends, arm-in-arm, paced the empty\r\nstreets, saying little, brooding much, yet gaining courage at every\r\nstep.  The touch of his guardian\'s arm thrilled Roger now and again with\r\na sensation of hope and relief in the midst of his dejection which\r\nalmost surprised him.  He had lost his brother; but was not this man as\r\ngood as a brother to him?  Would life be quite brotherless as long as he\r\nremained at his side?\r\n\r\nThe tutor, for his part, experienced a strange emotion too.  The opening\r\nday had brought a crisis in his life as well as in that of his ward.  It\r\nwas a day to which he had long looked forward, partly with the dread of\r\nseparation, partly with the joy of a man who has honestly done his work\r\nand is about to render up his trust.  But was it all over now?  No\r\nlonger now was he a guardian or governor.  Was he therefore to lose this\r\ngallant comrade, to whom all the brotherhood in his nature went out?\r\n\r\nWith reflections such as these it is scarcely to be wondered at that\r\nlittle was said during that long aimless walk.\r\n\r\nAt last Roger shivered.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s turn in," said Mr Armstrong.\r\n\r\nThey were in a street off the Strand, a long way from their hotel, and\r\nno cab in sight.\r\n\r\n"Any place will do," said Roger.  "Why not this?" and he pointed to the\r\ndoor of a seedy-looking private hotel, over which a lamp burned with the\r\nlegend--"Night porter in attendance."\r\n\r\nThe tutor surveyed the house curiously through his and then said--\r\n\r\n"Quite so; I stayed here once before," and rang the bell.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened by a person of whose nationality there could be\r\nlittle doubt, particularly when, after a momentary inspection of his\r\nbelated guests, he uttered an exclamation of joy and accosted the\r\ntutor--\r\n\r\n"_Mon ami_!  Oh!  I am glad to see you, my good friend.  Friend of my\r\n_pauvre pere_!--friend of my youth!  It is you.  Ah, Monsieur!" added\r\nhe, addressing Roger, "for your friend\'s sake you are welcome.\r\n_Entrez_!"\r\n\r\n"Be quiet now, Gustav," said the tutor.  "Bring us come coffee in the\r\ncoffee-room, if you can get it made, and light a fire in the bedroom.\r\nWe will talk in the morning."\r\n\r\nGustav gesticulated delighted acquiescence in any demand his hero made,\r\nand ushered them into the coffee-room.\r\n\r\n"What a queer fellow!" said Roger when he had vanished in search of the\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\n"Queer but good-hearted fellow is Gustav," said the tutor.  "I have\r\nknown him a long time; to-morrow I\'ll tell you-- Hullo!"\r\n\r\nThere was but a single candle in the room, and by its dim light, and\r\nthat of the half-expired fire, they had not at first been able to see\r\nthat they were not the sole occupants of the apartment.  On the sofa lay\r\ncurled the figure of a man breathing heavily, and, to judge by the\r\nspirit-bottle and glasses on the table at his hand, expiating a carouse\r\nby a disturbed and feverished slumber.\r\n\r\nThe tutor raised the candle so that the light fell more clearly on the\r\nsleeper.  Something in the figure had struck him.  The man lay with his\r\nface turned towards them.  He was stylishly though cheaply dressed.  His\r\nage may have been forty, and his features were half obscured by a\r\nprofuse and unkempt sandy beard.  This was not what had struck the\r\ntutor.  In his frequent turnings and tossings the sleeper had contrived\r\nto betray the fact that his hirsute appearance was due not to nature but\r\nto art.  A wire hook had been displaced from the ear, leaving one side\r\nof the wig tilted so as to disclose underneath the smooth cheek of a\r\nclean-shaven man.\r\n\r\nThe examination was still in process when Gustav re-entered the room.\r\nThe clatter with which he put down the cups on the table, aided by the\r\nglare of the candle and the tutor\'s sharp ejaculation, wakened the\r\nsleeper with a start.  He was sober enough as he raised his head sharply\r\nand sprang to his feet.  In doing this the treacherous wig slipped still\r\nfarther.  Before he could raise his hand to replace it Mr Armstrong had\r\nstepped forward and torn the mask from his face, disclosing the livid\r\ncountenance of Mr Robert Ratman!\r\n\r\nThe surprise on either side was at first beyond reach of words.  The\r\nmiscreant stood staring in a dazed way, first at Armstrong, then at\r\nRoger, then at Gustav, who, being a Frenchman, was the first to come to\r\nhis use of his tongue.\r\n\r\n"_Mon dieu_!  Monsieur, this is no bedroom for the gentleman.  It is\r\nforbidden to sleep all night in the _salle a manger_."\r\n\r\n"Silence, Gustav!  Go for a policeman," said Armstrong in a tone so\r\nstrange that the faithful Gustav slunk away like a dog with his tail\r\nbetween his legs.\r\n\r\n"Now, sir!" said the tutor as the door closed.\r\n\r\nThe wretch made one wild effort at escape.  He might have known by this\r\ntime with whom he had to deal.  Mr Armstrong held him by the wrist as\r\nin a vice.\r\n\r\n"It won\'t do, Ratman," said he.  "The game is up.  The best thing you\r\ncan do is to stand quietly here till the police come."\r\n\r\nThe prisoner sullenly abandoned his struggle, and turned with a bitter\r\nsneer to Roger.\r\n\r\n"So you\'ve run me down, have you?  You\'ve found your lost brother at\r\nlast?  I expected it.  I was a fool to suppose you would lift a finger\r\nfor me.  There\'s some chance of escaping from an enemy, but from a\r\nbrother who has set himself to hound a brother to death, never.  Never\r\nmind.  Your money\'s safe now.  Have me hung as soon as you like; the\r\nsooner the better for me."\r\n\r\nRoger, stupefied and stung to the quick by these taunts, winced as\r\nthough he and not the speaker were the miscreant.  He looked almost\r\nappealingly at his accuser, and tried to speak to justify himself, but\r\nthe words refused to come.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he seemed to detect in the prisoner\'s eye some new sinister\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n"Take care, Armstrong; take care!" he cried, and flung himself between\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\nIt was not an instant too soon.  With his free hand Ratman had contrived\r\nwhile talking to reach unheeded a pocket, from which he suddenly whipped\r\na pistol, and, pounding on his captor, fired.\r\n\r\nThe shot was badly and wildly aimed at the tutor\'s face.  Even at so\r\nshort a distance it might have missed its mark altogether.  Roger\'s\r\nsudden intervention, however, found it an unexpected target.  The lad\'s\r\nup-flung hand caught the pistol at the moment it went off, and received\r\nin its palm the ball which had been intended for his friend.\r\n\r\nThe sight of this untoward accident completely unnerved the prisoner.\r\nHe sullenly let the weapon drop from his fingers, and with the air of a\r\ngambler who has played and lost his last stake, sank listlessly on the\r\nsofa on which not ten minutes before he had been sleeping.\r\n\r\n"Luck\'s against me," he said with an oath.  "Look to the boy; I shan\'t\r\ntrouble you any more.  I\'ve done him harm enough without this.  I wish\r\nI\'d never heard of his elder brother."\r\n\r\nThe tutor, busy binding up his ward\'s hand, only half heard the words;\r\nbut Roger, amidst all his pain, heard it and looked up.\r\n\r\n"Then you are not my brother?" he said faintly.\r\n\r\n"Brother?  No.  And if you hadn\'t left the papers about in your room a\r\nyear ago I should never have known it was worth my while to pretend it."\r\n\r\nWhen, a few moments later, Gustav entered with two constables, Mr\r\nRatman welcomed the visitors with a sigh almost of relief, and placed\r\nhimself quietly in their hands.  As he passed the chair where Roger sat,\r\nhalf faint with pain and loss of blood, he stopped a moment and said--\r\n\r\n"Your brother!  No.  If I had been I shouldn\'t have come to this."\r\n\r\nAbout ten days later a small party was gathered in Roger\'s cosy den at\r\nMaxfield.\r\n\r\nThe young Squire was there, with his hand in a sling, still pale and\r\nweak, but able to sit up on the sofa and enjoy for the first time the\r\nsociety of a few choice friends.  Among those friends it was not\r\nsurprising to find Rosalind.  That young lady had recently exchanged the\r\nduties of governess at the Vicarage for those of temporary sick-nurse at\r\nthe manor-house, and to-night, in her simple mourning, with a flush of\r\npleasure on her cheek as now and again she turned her eyes to the\r\npatient whose recovery did her care such credit she looked--at least\r\nRoger, an impartial witness, thought so--more beautiful than ever.  But\r\nas Roger made the same discovery every time he and his nurse met, the\r\nopinion may be regarded as of relative value.  Tom was there, enjoying\r\nhimself as usual, indeed rather more than usual, because in the stable\r\nhard by, munching his oats, was a horse (the gift of the Squire) who\r\nowned him, Tom, as lord and master.  Jill was there too, a little\r\npensive as she looked round for some one who was not there, but trying\r\nhard to enjoy herself and seem glad.  Besides these intimates there was\r\nMr Headland, feeling like a father to everybody; Dr Brandram, in\r\nprofessional attendance; and the Vicar himself, accidentally present to\r\ncongratulate his young parishioner on his recovery.\r\n\r\nThe absentee of the evening was Mr Armstrong, who had gone to London\r\nthe previous day on matters connected with the approaching assizes.\r\n\r\n"I wish Armstrong was here," said Tom.  "Won\'t he open his eye when he\r\nsees `Crocodile\'!"\r\n\r\n"Crocodile" was the name of the horse before mentioned.\r\n\r\n"It hardly seems like a party without him," said Jill, blushing a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n"You were telling us about the letter written at sea," said the vicar.\r\n"Of course, you heard nothing of the ship in London?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I did," said Roger.  "After no end of disappointment, Armstrong\r\nsuggested telegraphing to the post-master at Havana, off which the\r\nletter was written, you know, and we heard that there had been a ship\r\ncalled the `Cyclops\' ten years ago trading between the West Indies and\r\nCeylon, but that nothing was known of any one of the name of Ingleton."\r\n\r\nRosalind looked up suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Ceylon and the West Indies?" exclaimed she.  "Roger, did Mr Armstrong\r\nnever tell you a story he once told me of a shark adventure which\r\nhappened to him when he was a sailor on a ship trading between Ceylon\r\nand the West Indies?"\r\n\r\nThe sudden silence which followed this inquiry was only broken by a low\r\nwhistle of wonder from Tom.\r\n\r\nRoger, with a flush of colour on his pale cheeks, sat up and said, "What\r\nis the story?"\r\n\r\nRosalind told it as nearly as possible in the tutor\'s own words.\r\n\r\n"He did not tell you the name of the ship?" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Or the name of the man who was killed?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nThere was another silence; it seemed as if they were sitting as\r\nwitnesses to the completion of some curious tunnelling operation, when\r\nthe party on one side suddenly catches sound of the pick-axe stroke of\r\nthe party on the other.  Step by step the lost Roger Ingleton had been\r\ntracked forward to the deck of this West India trading-ship; and\r\nbackward, step by step, the tutor\'s history went, till it almost touched\r\nthe same point.\r\n\r\n"I expect," said Tom, with a cheerfulness hardly in accord with the\r\nspirits of the company generally, "the fellow who was had by the shark\r\nwas the one, and Armstrong never knew it."\r\n\r\nThe profound young man had dropped on the very idea which was present in\r\nthe minds of each one.\r\n\r\n"Wal," said the American mayor, "it may be so; but the question I\'m\r\nasking myself is this: If so, it\'s singular Mr Armstrong did not\r\nmention the coincidence when you got the cablegram."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Roger, "at the time I was so cut up to find I\'d failed after\r\nall, that I didn\'t care to talk; and directly after that we met Ratman.\r\nHe had no chance."\r\n\r\n"I calculate I\'d like to ask your tutor one or two pertinent questions,"\r\nsaid the Mayor.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was fully with him, when Tom broke out again--\r\n\r\n"I say, I know.  Let\'s ask Gustav.  He\'s no end chummy with Armstrong.\r\nHe might know a thing or two.  He\'s the chap I told you about at\r\nChristy\'s minstrels," continued Master Tom, warming up at the genial\r\nreminiscence.\r\n\r\n"Is that the French waiter down-stairs who helped bring you down from\r\nLondon?" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n"Yes.  I\'m keeping him here as valet for the present.  Armstrong\r\nmentioned, I remember, that he knew him."\r\n\r\n"Ring him up," said Tom.\r\n\r\nGustav appeared, all smiles and shrugs and compliments.\r\n\r\n"_Eh bien_! my good gentleman," said he, "I am \'appy to see you well.  I\r\nwas _mortifie_ for your mishap; but Mademoiselle--ah, Mademoiselle!"--\r\nhere he raised his fingers gracefully to his lips--"ze angel step in\r\nwhere ze _pauvre garcon_ may not walk.  You could not but be well with a\r\nnurse so _charmante_.  Ah, my friend, \'ow \'appy will be my good, kind\r\nfriend when he return!"\r\n\r\n"You mean Mr Armstrong.  Have you known him long?" asked Roger.\r\n\r\n"_Pardieu_!  Ten, fifteen, twenty year; I know not how long.  He is\r\nbrother to me, your kind governor.  He is to the _pauvre pere_ a son,\r\nand to the _petite Francoise_--_ah! quelle est morte_!"\r\n\r\n"What was the name of your father?" demanded Roger, his hand tightening\r\non Rosalind\'s as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Monsieur! a poor name; he is called like me, Gustav Callot."\r\n\r\nThe poor valet was thunderstruck by the sensation which his simple words\r\ncaused.  Surely the English gentlemen and ladies are beautiful\r\nlisteners; no one ever paid him so much attention in his own country.\r\n\r\nThe American mayor took up the examination.\r\n\r\n"I reckon," drawled he, "that young man did not go by the name of\r\nArmstrong when you knew him."\r\n\r\n"Ah, no!  He has many names, my good, kind friend.  It was Monsieur\r\nRogers when we knew his finest.  Ah! he act the comedy beautiful!  Then\r\nwhen to came to cherish the _pauvre pere_ in Paris, and mourn with him\r\nthe death of _la petite Francoise_, he call himself by our poor name.\r\nAh! gentlemen, he was good to us.  All he save at `L\'Hotel Soult\' he\r\nshare with us--and _apres_ from the sea he even send us pay."\r\n\r\n"What was his ship, do you remember?"\r\n\r\n"Shall I forget?  He told us it had but one eye, and called itself\r\n`Cyclops\' Ah! _mes amis_," continued Gustav, delighted with his audience\r\nand amazed at his own oratorical gifts, "he was much changed when I saw\r\nhim next.  \'Tis six, seven, eight years since.  The beard is all shorn,\r\nthe curl is cut off, the eye looks through a glass, and the\r\nlaugh--_helas_! gentlemen, the gay laugh of the boy Rogers is turned to\r\nthe knit brow of the great man Armstrong."\r\n\r\nThe company had had enough of elocution for one evening, and dismissed\r\nthe orator with flattering marks of consideration.\r\n\r\nThe doctor and the vicar rose to go.  Close friends of the family as\r\nthey were, even they were superfluous at a time like this.\r\n\r\nBut the American mayor remained.\r\n\r\n"I guess," said he, "my nephew--"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" cried Jill, "then you are his uncle--dear, dear Mr Headland!" and\r\nthe little maid flung herself into the astonished gentleman\'s arms and\r\nrelieved her emotions with a flood of tears.\r\n\r\n"Seems to me," said he, looking down and kindly patting the fair head,\r\n"my nephew\'s a hundred miles too far away at this minute."\r\n\r\nAmerican mayors are not as a rule endowed with gifts of prophecy, but it\r\nseemed as if there was an exception to the rule in the case of Mr\r\nHeadland; for a moment later the door opened, and the tutor, eye-glass\r\nerect, and blissfully unconscious of the interest which his entry\r\nexcited, strolled jauntily in.\r\n\r\n"Ah," said he, "you\'re still up, then.  I just caught the last--"\r\n\r\nHe stopped short, and the glass dropped abruptly from his eye.  Roger\r\nhad staggered to his feet and was standing with face aglow, stretching\r\nout his hand.\r\n\r\nThe tutor comprehended all.  He advanced and placed his arm in that of\r\nhis brother.\r\n\r\n"You have found him at last, then, old fellow?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and without your help."\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Roger Ingleton, Minor, by Talbot Baines Reed\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ROGER INGLETON, MINOR ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 21042.txt or 21042.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/0/4/21042/\r\n\r\nProduced by Nick Hodson of London, England\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
