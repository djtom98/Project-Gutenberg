The moon\r\nwas to the west, setting, but still broad and bright. To the east, and\r\nright amidships of the dawn, which was all pink, the daystar sparkled\r\nlike a diamond. The land breeze blew in our faces, and smelt strong of\r\nwild lime and vanilla: other things besides, but these were the most\r\nplain; and the chill of it set me sneezing. I should say I had been for\r\nyears on a low island near the line, living for the most part solitary\r\namong natives. Here was a fresh experience: even the tongue would be\r\nquite strange to me; and the look of these woods and mountains, and the\r\nrare smell of them, renewed my blood.\r\n\r\nThe captain blew out the binnacle lamp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthere goes a bit of smoke, Mr. Wiltshire, behind the\r\nbreak of the reef. That\xe2\x80\x99s Fales\xc3\xa1, where your station is, the last\r\nvillage to the east; nobody lives to windward\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why. Take my\r\nglass, and you can make the houses out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took the glass; and the shores leaped nearer, and I saw the tangle of\r\nthe woods and the breach of the surf, and the brown roofs and the black\r\ninsides of houses peeped among the trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you catch a bit of white there to the east\xe2\x80\x99ard?\xe2\x80\x9d the captain\r\ncontinued. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s your house. Coral built, stands high, verandah you\r\ncould walk on three abreast; best station in the South Pacific. When\r\nold Adams saw it, he took and shook me by the hand. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve dropped into\r\na soft thing here,\xe2\x80\x99 says he.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98So you have,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98and time too!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nPoor Johnny! I never saw him again but the once, and then he had\r\nchanged his tune\xe2\x80\x94couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get on with the natives, or the whites, or\r\nsomething; and the next time we came round there he was dead and\r\nburied. I took and put up a bit of a stick to him: \xe2\x80\x98John Adams, _obit_\r\neighteen and sixty-eight. Go thou and do likewise.\xe2\x80\x99 I missed that man.\r\nI never could see much harm in Johnny.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he die of?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome kind of sickness,\xe2\x80\x9d says the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cIt appears it took him\r\nsudden. Seems he got up in the night, and filled up on Pain-Killer and\r\nKennedy\xe2\x80\x99s Discovery. No go: he was booked beyond Kennedy. Then he had\r\ntried to open a case of gin. No go again: not strong enough. Then he\r\nmust have turned to and run out on the verandah, and capsized over the\r\nrail. When they found him, the next day, he was clean crazy\xe2\x80\x94carried on\r\nall the time about somebody watering his copra. Poor John!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it thought to be the island?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it was thought to be the island, or the trouble, or something,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI never could hear but what it was a healthy place. Our\r\nlast man, Vigours, never turned a hair. He left because of the\r\nbeach\xe2\x80\x94said he was afraid of Black Jack and Case and Whistling Jimmie,\r\nwho was still alive at the time, but got drowned soon afterward when\r\ndrunk. As for old Captain Randall, he\xe2\x80\x99s been here any time since\r\neighteen-forty, forty-five. I never could see much harm in Billy, nor\r\nmuch change. Seems as if he might live to be Old Kafoozleum. No, I\r\nguess it\xe2\x80\x99s healthy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a boat coming now,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s right in the pass; looks to\r\nbe a sixteen-foot whale; two white men in the stern sheets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the boat that drowned Whistling Jimmie!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the Captain;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s see the glass. Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s Case, sure enough, and the darkie.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99ve got a gallows bad reputation, but you know what a place the\r\nbeach is for talking. My belief, that Whistling Jimmie was the worst of\r\nthe trouble; and he\xe2\x80\x99s gone to glory, you see. What\xe2\x80\x99ll you bet they\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t after gin? Lay you five to two they take six cases.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen these two traders came aboard I was pleased with the looks of them\r\nat once, or, rather, with the looks of both, and the speech of one. I\r\nwas sick for white neighbours after my four years at the line, which I\r\nalways counted years of prison; getting tabooed, and going down to the\r\nSpeak House to see and get it taken off; buying gin and going on a\r\nbreak, and then repenting; sitting in the house at night with the lamp\r\nfor company; or walking on the beach and wondering what kind of a fool\r\nto call myself for being where I was. There were no other whites upon\r\nmy island, and when I sailed to the next, rough customers made the most\r\nof the society. Now to see these two when they came aboard was a\r\npleasure. One was a negro, to be sure; but they were both rigged out\r\nsmart in striped pyjamas and straw hats, and Case would have passed\r\nmuster in a city. He was yellow and smallish, had a hawk\xe2\x80\x99s nose to his\r\nface, pale eyes, and his beard trimmed with scissors. No man knew his\r\ncountry, beyond he was of English speech; and it was clear he came of a\r\ngood family and was splendidly educated. He was accomplished too;\r\nplayed the accordion first-rate; and give him a piece of string or a\r\ncork or a pack of cards, and he could show you tricks equal to any\r\nprofessional. He could speak, when he chose, fit for a drawing-room;\r\nand when he chose he could blaspheme worse than a Yankee boatswain, and\r\ntalk smart to sicken a Kanaka. The way he thought would pay best at the\r\nmoment, that was Case\xe2\x80\x99s way, and it always seemed to come natural, and\r\nlike as if he was born to it. He had the courage of a lion and the\r\ncunning of a rat; and if he\xe2\x80\x99s not in hell to-day, there\xe2\x80\x99s no such\r\nplace. I know but one good point to the man: that he was fond of his\r\nwife, and kind to her. She was a Samoa woman, and dyed her hair red,\r\nSamoa style; and when he came to die (as I have to tell of) they found\r\none strange thing\xe2\x80\x94that he had made a will, like a Christian, and the\r\nwidow got the lot: all his, they said, and all Black Jack\xe2\x80\x99s, and the\r\nmost of Billy Randall\xe2\x80\x99s in the bargain, for it was Case that kept the\r\nbooks. So she went off home in the schooner _Manu\xe2\x80\x99a_, and does the lady\r\nto this day in her own place.\r\n\r\nBut of all this on that first morning I knew no more than a fly. Case\r\nused me like a gentleman and like a friend, made me welcome to Fales\xc3\xa1,\r\nand put his services at my disposal, which was the more helpful from my\r\nignorance of the native. All the better part of the day we sat drinking\r\nbetter acquaintance in the cabin, and I never heard a man talk more to\r\nthe point. There was no smarter trader, and none dodgier, in the\r\nislands. I thought Fales\xc3\xa1 seemed to be the right kind of a place; and\r\nthe more I drank the lighter my heart. Our last trader had fled the\r\nplace at half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s notice, taking a chance passage in a labour\r\nship from up west. The captain, when he came, had found the station\r\nclosed, the keys left with the native pastor, and a letter from the\r\nrunaway, confessing he was fairly frightened of his life. Since then\r\nthe firm had not been represented, and of course there was no cargo.\r\nThe wind, besides, was fair, the captain hoped he could make his next\r\nisland by dawn, with a good tide, and the business of landing my trade\r\nwas gone about lively. There was no call for me to fool with it, Case\r\nsaid; nobody would touch my things, everyone was honest in Fales\xc3\xa1, only\r\nabout chickens or an odd knife or an odd stick of tobacco; and the best\r\nI could do was to sit quiet till the vessel left, then come straight to\r\nhis house, see old Captain Randall, the father of the beach, take\r\npot-luck, and go home to sleep when it got dark. So it was high noon,\r\nand the schooner was under way before I set my foot on shore at Fales\xc3\xa1.\r\n\r\nI had a glass or two on board; I was just off a long cruise, and the\r\nground heaved under me like a ship\xe2\x80\x99s deck. The world was like all new\r\npainted; my foot went along to music; Fales\xc3\xa1 might have been Fiddler\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nGreen, if there is such a place, and more\xe2\x80\x99s the pity if there isn\xe2\x80\x99t! It\r\nwas good to foot the grass, to look aloft at the green mountains, to\r\nsee the men with their green wreaths and the women in their bright\r\ndresses, red and blue. On we went, in the strong sun and the cool\r\nshadow, liking both; and all the children in the town came trotting\r\nafter with their shaven heads and their brown bodies, and raising a\r\nthin kind of a cheer in our wake, like crowing poultry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy-the-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d says Case, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must get you a wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a crowd of girls about us, and I pulled myself up and looked\r\namong them like a Bashaw. They were all dressed out for the sake of the\r\nship being in; and the women of Fales\xc3\xa1 are a handsome lot to see. If\r\nthey have a fault, they are a trifle broad in the beam; and I was just\r\nthinking so when Case touched me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\nI saw one coming on the other side alone. She had been fishing; all she\r\nwore was a chemise, and it was wetted through. She was young and very\r\nslender for an island maid, with a long face, a high forehead, and a\r\nshy, strange, blindish look, between a cat\xe2\x80\x99s and a baby\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s she?\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Uma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Case, and he called her up and spoke to her in the\r\nnative. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what he said; but when he was in the midst she\r\nlooked up at me quick and timid, like a child dodging a blow, then down\r\nagain, and presently smiled. She had a wide mouth, the lips and the\r\nchin cut like any statue\xe2\x80\x99s; and the smile came out for a moment and was\r\ngone. Then she stood with her head bent, and heard Case to an end,\r\nspoke back in the pretty Polynesian voice, looking him full in the\r\nface, heard him again in answer, and then with an obeisance started\r\noff. I had just a share of the bow, but never another shot of her eye,\r\nand there was no more word of smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI guess it\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Case. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess you can have her. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmake it square with the old lady. You can have your pick of the lot for\r\na plug of tobacco,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, sneering.\r\n\r\nI suppose it was the smile stuck in my memory, for I spoke back sharp.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look that sort,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that she is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Case. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe she\xe2\x80\x99s as right as the\r\nmail. Keeps to herself, don\xe2\x80\x99t go round with the gang, and that. O no,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you misunderstand me\xe2\x80\x94Uma\xe2\x80\x99s on the square.\xe2\x80\x9d He spoke eager, I\r\nthought, and that surprised and pleased me. \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make so sure of getting her, only she cottoned to the cut of\r\nyour jib. All you have to do is to keep dark and let me work the mother\r\nmy own way; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring the girl round to the captain\xe2\x80\x99s for the\r\nmarriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for the word marriage, and I said so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to hurt in the marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Jack\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe chaplain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time we had come in view of the house of these three white men;\r\nfor a negro is counted a white man, and so is a Chinese! a strange\r\nidea, but common in the islands. It was a board house with a strip of\r\nrickety verandah. The store was to the front, with a counter, scales,\r\nand the poorest possible display of trade: a case or two of tinned\r\nmeats; a barrel of hard bread; a few bolts of cotton stuff, not to be\r\ncompared with mine; the only thing well represented being the\r\ncontraband, firearms and liquor. \xe2\x80\x9cIf these are my only rivals,\xe2\x80\x9d thinks\r\nI, \xe2\x80\x9cI should do well in Fales\xc3\xa1.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed, there was only the one way\r\nthey could touch me, and that was with the guns and drink.\r\n\r\nIn the back room was old Captain Randall, squatting on the floor native\r\nfashion, fat and pale, naked to the waist, grey as a badger, and his\r\neyes set with drink. His body was covered with grey hair and crawled\r\nover by flies; one was in the corner of his eye\xe2\x80\x94he never heeded; and\r\nthe mosquitoes hummed about the man like bees. Any clean-minded man\r\nwould have had the creature out at once and buried him; and to see him,\r\nand think he was seventy, and remember he had once commanded a ship,\r\nand come ashore in his smart togs, and talked big in bars and\r\nconsulates, and sat in club verandahs, turned me sick and sober.\r\n\r\nHe tried to get up when I came in, but that was hopeless; so he reached\r\nme a hand instead, and stumbled out some salutation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa\xe2\x80\x99s [1] pretty full this morning,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Case. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had an\r\nepidemic here; and Captain Randall takes gin for a prophylactic\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou, Papa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever took such a thing in my life!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the captain indignantly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake gin for my health\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Mr. Wha\xe2\x80\x99s-ever-your-name\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nprecautionary measure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right, Papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Case. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to brace up.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a marriage\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Wiltshire here is going to get\r\nspliced.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man asked to whom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Uma,\xe2\x80\x9d said Case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUma!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cWha\xe2\x80\x99s he want Uma for? \xe2\x80\x99s he come here for\r\nhis health, anyway? Wha\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99n hell\xe2\x80\x99s he want Uma for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDry up, Papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Case. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tain\xe2\x80\x99t you that\xe2\x80\x99s to marry her. I guess\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not her godfather and godmother. I guess Mr. Wiltshire\xe2\x80\x99s going\r\nto please himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he made an excuse to me that he must move about the marriage,\r\nand left me alone with the poor wretch that was his partner and (to\r\nspeak truth) his gull. Trade and station belonged both to Randall; Case\r\nand the negro were parasites; they crawled and fed upon him like the\r\nflies, he none the wiser. Indeed, I have no harm to say of Billy\r\nRandall beyond the fact that my gorge rose at him, and the time I now\r\npassed in his company was like a nightmare.\r\n\r\nThe room was stifling hot and full of flies; for the house was dirty\r\nand low and small, and stood in a bad place, behind the village, in the\r\nborders of the bush, and sheltered from the trade. The three men\xe2\x80\x99s beds\r\nwere on the floor, and a litter of pans and dishes. There was no\r\nstanding furniture; Randall, when he was violent, tearing it to laths.\r\nThere I sat and had a meal which was served us by Case\xe2\x80\x99s wife; and\r\nthere I was entertained all day by that remains of man, his tongue\r\nstumbling among low old jokes and long old stories, and his own wheezy\r\nlaughter always ready, so that he had no sense of my depression. He was\r\nnipping gin all the while. Sometimes he fell asleep, and awoke again,\r\nwhimpering and shivering, and every now and again he would ask me why I\r\nwanted to marry Uma. \xe2\x80\x9cMy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d I was telling myself all day, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nmust not come to be an old gentleman like this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt might be four in the afternoon, perhaps, when the back door was\r\nthrust slowly open, and a strange old native woman crawled into the\r\nhouse almost on her belly. She was swathed in black stuff to her heels;\r\nher hair was grey in swatches; her face was tattooed, which was not the\r\npractice in that island; her eyes big and bright and crazy. These she\r\nfixed upon me with a rapt expression that I saw to be part acting. She\r\nsaid no plain word, but smacked and mumbled with her lips, and hummed\r\naloud, like a child over its Christmas pudding. She came straight\r\nacross the house, heading for me, and, as soon as she was alongside,\r\ncaught up my hand and purred and crooned over it like a great cat. From\r\nthis she slipped into a kind of song.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho the devil\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d cried I, for the thing startled me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Fa\xe2\x80\x99avao,\xe2\x80\x9d says Randall; and I saw he had hitched along the floor\r\ninto the farthest corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ain\xe2\x80\x99t afraid of her?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe \xe2\x80\x99fraid!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the captain. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend, I defy her! I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet her put her foot in here, only I suppose \xe2\x80\x99s different to-day, for\r\nthe marriage. \xe2\x80\x99s Uma\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, suppose it is; what\xe2\x80\x99s she carrying on about?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, more\r\nirritated, perhaps more frightened, than I cared to show; and the\r\ncaptain told me she was making up a quantity of poetry in my praise\r\nbecause I was to marry Uma. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, old lady,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, with rather\r\na failure of a laugh, \xe2\x80\x9canything to oblige. But when you\xe2\x80\x99re done with my\r\nhand, you might let me know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did as though she understood; the song rose into a cry, and\r\nstopped; the woman crouched out of the house the same way that she came\r\nin, and must have plunged straight into the bush, for when I followed\r\nher to the door she had already vanished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are rum manners,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99s a rum crowd,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, and, to my surprise, he made the\r\nsign of the cross on his bare bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHillo!\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9care you a Papist?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe repudiated the idea with contempt. \xe2\x80\x9cHard-shell Baptis\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear friend, the Papists got some good ideas too; and tha\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99s\r\none of \xe2\x80\x99em. You take my advice, and whenever you come across Uma or\r\nFa\xe2\x80\x99avao or Vigours, or any of that crowd, you take a leaf out o\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\npriests, and do what I do. Savvy?\xe2\x80\x9d says he, repeated the sign, and\r\nwinked his dim eye at me. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, _sir_!\xe2\x80\x9d he broke out again, \xe2\x80\x9cno Papists\r\nhere!\xe2\x80\x9d and for a long time entertained me with his religious opinions.\r\n\r\nI must have been taken with Uma from the first, or I should certainly\r\nhave fled from that house, and got into the clean air, and the clean\r\nsea, or some convenient river\xe2\x80\x94though, it\xe2\x80\x99s true, I was committed to\r\nCase; and, besides, I could never have held my head up in that island\r\nif I had run from a girl upon my wedding-night.\r\n\r\nThe sun was down, the sky all on fire, and the lamp had been some time\r\nlighted, when Case came back with Uma and the negro. She was dressed\r\nand scented; her kilt was of fine tapa, looking richer in the folds\r\nthan any silk; her bust, which was of the colour of dark honey, she\r\nwore bare only for some half a dozen necklaces of seeds and flowers;\r\nand behind her ears and in her hair she had the scarlet flowers of the\r\nhibiscus. She showed the best bearing for a bride conceivable, serious\r\nand still; and I thought shame to stand up with her in that mean house\r\nand before that grinning negro. I thought shame, I say; for the\r\nmountebank was dressed with a big paper collar, the book he made\r\nbelieve to read from was an odd volume of a novel, and the words of his\r\nservice not fit to be set down. My conscience smote me when we joined\r\nhands; and when she got her certificate I was tempted to throw up the\r\nbargain and confess. Here is the document. It was Case that wrote it,\r\nsignatures and all, in a leaf out of the ledger:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThis is to certify that Uma, daughter of Fa\xe2\x80\x99avao of Fales\xc3\xa1, Island of\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, is illegally married to Mr. John Wiltshire for one week, and Mr.\r\nJohn Wiltshire is at liberty to send her to hell when he pleases.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN BLACKAMOAR.\r\nChaplain to the hulks.\r\n\r\n\r\nExtracted from the Register\r\nby William T. Randall,\r\nMaster Mariner.\r\n\r\n\r\nA nice paper to put in a girl\xe2\x80\x99s hand and see her hide away like gold. A\r\nman might easily feel cheap for less. But it was the practice in these\r\nparts, and (as I told myself) not the least the fault of us white men,\r\nbut of the missionaries. If they had let the natives be, I had never\r\nneeded this deception, but taken all the wives I wished, and left them\r\nwhen I pleased, with a clear conscience.\r\n\r\nThe more ashamed I was, the more hurry I was in to be gone; and our\r\ndesires thus jumping together, I made the less remark of a change in\r\nthe traders. Case had been all eagerness to keep me; now, as though he\r\nhad attained a purpose, he seemed all eagerness to have me go. Uma, he\r\nsaid, could show me to my house, and the three bade us farewell\r\nindoors.\r\n\r\nThe night was nearly come; the village smelt of trees and flowers and\r\nthe sea and bread-fruit-cooking; there came a fine roll of sea from the\r\nreef, and from a distance, among the woods and houses, many pretty\r\nsounds of men and children. It did me good to breathe free air; it did\r\nme good to be done with the captain and see, instead, the creature at\r\nmy side. I felt for all the world as though she were some girl at home\r\nin the Old Country, and, forgetting myself for the minute, took her\r\nhand to walk with. Her fingers nestled into mine, I heard her breathe\r\ndeep and quick, and all at once she caught my hand to her face and\r\npressed it there. \xe2\x80\x9cYou good!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, and ran ahead of me, and\r\nstopped and looked back and smiled, and ran ahead of me again, thus\r\nguiding me through the edge of the bush, and by a quiet way to my own\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, Case had done the courting for me in style\xe2\x80\x94told her I was\r\nmad to have her, and cared nothing for the consequence; and the poor\r\nsoul, knowing that which I was still ignorant of, believed it, every\r\nword, and had her head nigh turned with vanity and gratitude. Now, of\r\nall this I had no guess; I was one of those most opposed to any\r\nnonsense about native women, having seen so many whites eaten up by\r\ntheir wives\xe2\x80\x99 relatives, and made fools of in the bargain; and I told\r\nmyself I must make a stand at once, and bring her to her bearings. But\r\nshe looked so quaint and pretty as she ran away and then awaited me,\r\nand the thing was done so like a child or a kind dog, that the best I\r\ncould do was just to follow her whenever she went on, to listen for the\r\nfall of her bare feet, and to watch in the dusk for the shining of her\r\nbody. And there was another thought came in my head. She played kitten\r\nwith me now when we were alone; but in the house she had carried it the\r\nway a countess might, so proud and humble. And what with her dress\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nall there was so little of it, and that native enough\xe2\x80\x94what with her\r\nfine tapa and fine scents, and her red flowers and seeds, that were\r\nquite as bright as jewels, only larger\xe2\x80\x94it came over me she was a kind\r\nof countess really, dressed to hear great singers at a concert, and no\r\neven mate for a poor trader like myself.\r\n\r\nShe was the first in the house; and while I was still without I saw a\r\nmatch flash and the lamplight kindle in the windows. The station was a\r\nwonderful fine place, coral built, with quite a wide verandah, and the\r\nmain room high and wide. My chests and cases had been piled in, and\r\nmade rather of a mess; and there, in the thick of the confusion, stood\r\nUma by the table, awaiting me. Her shadow went all the way up behind\r\nher into the hollow of the iron roof; she stood against it bright, the\r\nlamplight shining on her skin. I stopped in the door, and she looked at\r\nme, not speaking, with eyes that were eager and yet daunted; then she\r\ntouched herself on the bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe\xe2\x80\x94your wifie,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. It had never taken me like that before; but\r\nthe want of her took and shook all through me, like the wind in the\r\nluff of a sail.\r\n\r\nI could not speak if I had wanted; and if I could, I would not. I was\r\nashamed to be so much moved about a native, ashamed of the marriage\r\ntoo, and the certificate she had treasured in her kilt; and I turned\r\naside and made believe to rummage among my cases. The first thing I\r\nlighted on was a case of gin, the only one that I had brought; and,\r\npartly for the girl\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and partly for horror of the recollections\r\nof old Randall, took a sudden resolve. I prized the lid off. One by one\r\nI drew the bottles with a pocket corkscrew, and sent Uma out to pour\r\nthe stuff from the verandah.\r\n\r\nShe came back after the last, and looked at me puzzled like.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo good,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, for I was now a little better master of my tongue.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMan he drink, he no good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe agreed with this, but kept considering. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy you bring him?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nasked presently. \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you no want drink, you no bring him, I\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cOne time I want drink too much; now no\r\nwant. You see, I no savvy I get one little wifie. Suppose I drink gin,\r\nmy little wifie he \xe2\x80\x99fraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo speak to her kindly was about more than I was fit for; I had made my\r\nvow I would never let on to weakness with a native, and I had nothing\r\nfor it but to stop.\r\n\r\nShe stood looking gravely down at me where I sat by the open case. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink you good man,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. And suddenly she had fallen before me on\r\nthe floor. \xe2\x80\x9cI belong you all-e-same pig!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nTHE BAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nI came on the verandah just before the sun rose on the morrow. My house\r\nwas the last on the east; there was a cape of woods and cliffs behind\r\nthat hid the sunrise. To the west, a swift cold river ran down, and\r\nbeyond was the green of the village, dotted with cocoa-palms and\r\nbreadfruits and houses. The shutters were some of them down and some\r\nopen; I saw the mosquito bars still stretched, with shadows of people\r\nnew-awakened sitting up inside; and all over the green others were\r\nstalking silent, wrapped in their many-coloured sleeping clothes like\r\nBedouins in Bible pictures. It was mortal still and solemn and chilly,\r\nand the light of the dawn on the lagoon was like the shining of a fire.\r\n\r\nBut the thing that troubled me was nearer hand. Some dozen young men\r\nand children made a piece of a half-circle, flanking my house: the\r\nriver divided them, some were on the near side, some on the far, and\r\none on a boulder in the midst; and they all sat silent, wrapped in\r\ntheir sheets, and stared at me and my house as straight as pointer\r\ndogs. I thought it strange as I went out. When I had bathed and come\r\nback again, and found them all there, and two or three more along with\r\nthem, I thought it stranger still. What could they see to gaze at in my\r\nhouse, I wondered, and went in.\r\n\r\nBut the thought of these starers stuck in my mind, and presently I came\r\nout again. The sun was now up, but it was still behind the cape of\r\nwoods. Say a quarter of an hour had come and gone. The crowd was\r\ngreatly increased, the far bank of the river was lined for quite a\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94perhaps thirty grown folk, and of children twice as many, some\r\nstanding, some squatted on the ground, and all staring at my house. I\r\nhave seen a house in a South Sea village thus surrounded, but then a\r\ntrader was thrashing his wife inside, and she singing out. Here was\r\nnothing: the stove was alight, the smoke going up in a Christian\r\nmanner; all was shipshape and Bristol fashion. To be sure, there was a\r\nstranger come, but they had a chance to see that stranger yesterday,\r\nand took it quiet enough. What ailed them now? I leaned my arms on the\r\nrail and stared back. Devil a wink they had in them! Now and then I\r\ncould see the children chatter, but they spoke so low not even the hum\r\nof their speaking came my length. The rest were like graven images:\r\nthey stared at me, dumb and sorrowful, with their bright eyes; and it\r\ncame upon me things would look not much different if I were on the\r\nplatform of the gallows, and these good folk had come to see me hanged.\r\n\r\nI felt I was getting daunted, and began to be afraid I looked it, which\r\nwould never do. Up I stood, made believe to stretch myself, came down\r\nthe verandah stair, and strolled towards the river. There went a short\r\nbuzz from one to the other, like what you hear in theatres when the\r\ncurtain goes up; and some of the nearest gave back the matter of a\r\npace. I saw a girl lay one hand on a young man and make a gesture\r\nupward with the other; at the same time she said something in the\r\nnative with a gasping voice. Three little boys sat beside my path,\r\nwhere I must pass within three feet of them. Wrapped in their sheets,\r\nwith their shaved heads and bits of top-knots, and queer faces, they\r\nlooked like figures on a chimney-piece. Awhile they sat their ground,\r\nsolemn as judges. I came up hand over fist, doing my five knots, like a\r\nman that meant business; and I thought I saw a sort of a wink and gulp\r\nin the three faces. Then one jumped up (he was the farthest off) and\r\nran for his mammy. The other two, trying to follow suit, got foul, came\r\nto ground together bawling, wriggled right out of their sheets\r\nmother-naked, and in a moment there were all three of them scampering\r\nfor their lives and singing out like pigs. The natives, who would never\r\nlet a joke slip, even at a burial, laughed and let up, as short as a\r\ndog\xe2\x80\x99s bark.\r\n\r\nThey say it scares a man to be alone. No such thing. What scares him in\r\nthe dark or the high bush is that he can\xe2\x80\x99t make sure, and there might\r\nbe an army at his elbow. What scares him worst is to be right in the\r\nmidst of a crowd, and have no guess of what they\xe2\x80\x99re driving at. When\r\nthat laugh stopped, I stopped too. The boys had not yet made their\r\noffing, they were still on the full stretch going the one way, when I\r\nhad already gone about ship and was sheering off the other. Like a fool\r\nI had come out, doing my five knots; like a fool I went back again. It\r\nmust have been the funniest thing to see, and what knocked me silly,\r\nthis time no one laughed; only one old woman gave a kind of pious moan,\r\nthe way you have heard Dissenters in their chapels at the sermon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw such fools of Kanakas as your people here,\xe2\x80\x9d I said once to\r\nUma, glancing out of the window at the starers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSavvy nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d says Uma, with a kind of disgusted air that she was\r\ngood at.\r\n\r\nAnd that was all the talk we had upon the matter, for I was put out,\r\nand Uma took the thing so much as a matter of course that I was fairly\r\nashamed.\r\n\r\nAll day, off and on, now fewer and now more, the fools sat about the\r\nwest end of my house and across the river, waiting for the show,\r\nwhatever that was\xe2\x80\x94fire to come down from heaven, I suppose, and consume\r\nme, bones and baggage. But by evening, like real islanders, they had\r\nwearied of the business, and got away, and had a dance instead in the\r\nbig house of the village, where I heard them singing and clapping hands\r\ntill, maybe, ten at night, and the next day it seemed they had\r\nforgotten I existed. If fire had come down from heaven or the earth\r\nopened and swallowed me, there would have been nobody to see the sport\r\nor take the lesson, or whatever you like to call it. But I was to find\r\nthey hadn\xe2\x80\x99t forgot either, and kept an eye lifting for phenomena over\r\nmy way.\r\n\r\nI was hard at it both these days getting my trade in order and taking\r\nstock of what Vigours had left. This was a job that made me pretty\r\nsick, and kept me from thinking on much else. Ben had taken stock the\r\ntrip before\xe2\x80\x94I knew I could trust Ben\xe2\x80\x94but it was plain somebody had been\r\nmaking free in the meantime. I found I was out by what might easily\r\ncover six months\xe2\x80\x99 salary and profit, and I could have kicked myself all\r\nround the village to have been such a blamed ass, sitting boozing with\r\nthat Case instead of attending to my own affairs and taking stock.\r\n\r\nHowever, there\xe2\x80\x99s no use crying over spilt milk. It was done now, and\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be undone. All I could do was to get what was left of it, and\r\nmy new stuff (my own choice) in order, to go round and get after the\r\nrats and cockroaches, and to fix up that store regular Sydney style. A\r\nfine show I made of it; and the third morning when I had lit my pipe\r\nand stood in the door-way and looked in, and turned and looked far up\r\nthe mountain and saw the cocoanuts waving and posted up the tons of\r\ncopra, and over the village green and saw the island dandies and\r\nreckoned up the yards of print they wanted for their kilts and dresses,\r\nI felt as if I was in the right place to make a fortune, and go home\r\nagain and start a public-house. There was I, sitting in that verandah,\r\nin as handsome a piece of scenery as you could find, a splendid sun,\r\nand a fine fresh healthy trade that stirred up a man\xe2\x80\x99s blood like\r\nsea-bathing; and the whole thing was clean gone from me, and I was\r\ndreaming England, which is, after all, a nasty, cold, muddy hole, with\r\nnot enough light to see to read by; and dreaming the looks of my\r\npublic, by a cant of a broad high-road like an avenue, and with the\r\nsign on a green tree.\r\n\r\nSo much for the morning, but the day passed and the devil anyone looked\r\nnear me, and from all I knew of natives in other islands I thought this\r\nstrange. People laughed a little at our firm and their fine stations,\r\nand at this station of Fales\xc3\xa1 in particular; all the copra in the\r\ndistrict wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pay for it (I had heard them say) in fifty years,\r\nwhich I supposed was an exaggeration. But when the day went, and no\r\nbusiness came at all, I began to get downhearted; and, about three in\r\nthe afternoon, I went out for a stroll to cheer me up. On the green I\r\nsaw a white man coming with a cassock on, by which and by the face of\r\nhim I knew he was a priest. He was a good-natured old soul to look at,\r\ngone a little grizzled, and so dirty you could have written with him on\r\na piece of paper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood day, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nHe answered me eagerly in native.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you speak any English?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrench,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tried me awhile in the French, and then again in native, which he\r\nseemed to think was the best chance. I made out he was after more than\r\npassing the time of day with me, but had something to communicate, and\r\nI listened the harder. I heard the names of Adams and Case and of\r\nRandall\xe2\x80\x94Randall the oftenest\xe2\x80\x94and the word \xe2\x80\x9cpoison,\xe2\x80\x9d or something like\r\nit, and a native word that he said very often. I went home, repeating\r\nit to myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does fussy-ocky mean?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked of Uma, for that was as near as I\r\ncould come to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMake dead,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil it does!\xe2\x80\x9d says I. \xe2\x80\x9cDid ever you hear that Case had poisoned\r\nJohnnie Adams?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery man he savvy that,\xe2\x80\x9d says Uma, scornful-like. \xe2\x80\x9cGive him white\r\nsand\xe2\x80\x94bad sand. He got the bottle still. Suppose he give you gin, you no\r\ntake him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow I had heard much the same sort of story in other islands, and the\r\nsame white powder always to the front, which made me think the less of\r\nit. For all that, I went over to Randall\xe2\x80\x99s place to see what I could\r\npick up, and found Case on the doorstep, cleaning a gun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood shooting here?\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA 1,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bush is full of all kinds of birds. I wish copra\r\nwas as plenty,\xe2\x80\x9d says he\xe2\x80\x94I thought, slyly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbut there don\xe2\x80\x99t seem anything\r\ndoing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could see Black Jack in the store, serving a customer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat looks like business, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the first sale we\xe2\x80\x99ve made in three weeks,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d says I. \xe2\x80\x9cThree weeks? Well, well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me,\xe2\x80\x9d he cries, a little hot, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can go and look\r\nat the copra-house. It\xe2\x80\x99s half empty to this blessed hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be much the better for that, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d says I. \xe2\x80\x9cFor all I\r\ncan tell, it might have been whole empty yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, with a bit of a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy-the-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat sort of a party is that priest? Seems\r\nrather a friendly sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this Case laughed right out loud. \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cI see what ails\r\nyou now. Galuchet\xe2\x80\x99s been at you.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94_Father Galoshes_ was the name he\r\nwent by most, but Case always gave it the French quirk, which was\r\nanother reason we had for thinking him above the common.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have seen him,\xe2\x80\x9d I says. \xe2\x80\x9cI made out he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think much of\r\nyour Captain Randall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat he don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d says Case. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the trouble about poor Adams. The\r\nlast day, when he lay dying, there was young Buncombe round. Ever met\r\nBuncombe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told him no.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a cure, is Buncombe!\xe2\x80\x9d laughs Case. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Buncombe took it in his\r\nhead that, as there was no other clergyman about, bar Kanaka pastors,\r\nwe ought to call in Father Galuchet, and have the old man administered\r\nand take the sacrament. It was all the same to me, you may suppose; but\r\nI said I thought Adams was the fellow to consult. He was jawing away\r\nabout watered copra and a sight of foolery. \xe2\x80\x98Look here,\xe2\x80\x99 I said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re pretty sick. Would you like to see Galoshes?\xe2\x80\x99 He sat right up\r\non his elbow. \xe2\x80\x98Get the priest,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98get the priest; don\xe2\x80\x99t let me\r\ndie here like a dog!\xe2\x80\x99 He spoke kind of fierce and eager, but sensible\r\nenough. There was nothing to say against that, so we sent and asked\r\nGaluchet if he would come. You bet he would. He jumped in his dirty\r\nlinen at the thought of it. But we had reckoned without Papa. He\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nhard-shell Baptist, is Papa; no Papists need apply. And he took and\r\nlocked the door. Buncombe told him he was bigoted, and I thought he\r\nwould have had a fit. \xe2\x80\x98Bigoted!\xe2\x80\x99 he says. \xe2\x80\x98Me bigoted? Have I lived to\r\nhear it from a jackanapes like you?\xe2\x80\x99 And he made for Buncombe, and I\r\nhad to hold them apart; and there was Adams in the middle, gone luny\r\nagain, and carrying on about copra like a born fool. It was good as the\r\nplay, and I was about knocked out of time with laughing, when all of a\r\nsudden Adams sat up, clapped his hands to his chest, and went into the\r\nhorrors. He died hard, did John Adams,\xe2\x80\x9d says Case, with a kind of a\r\nsudden sternness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what became of the priest?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe priest?\xe2\x80\x9d says Case. \xe2\x80\x9cO! he was hammering on the door outside, and\r\ncrying on the natives to come and beat it in, and singing out it was a\r\nsoul he wished to save, and that. He was in a rare taking, was the\r\npriest. But what would you have? Johnny had slipped his cable; no more\r\nJohnny in the market; and the administration racket clean played out.\r\nNext thing, word came to Randall the priest was praying upon Johnny\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrave. Papa was pretty full, and got a club, and lit out straight for\r\nthe place, and there was Galoshes on his knees, and a lot of natives\r\nlooking on. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think Papa cared\xe2\x80\x94that much about anything,\r\nunless it was liquor; but he and the priest stuck to it two hours,\r\nslanging each other in native, and every time Galoshes tried to kneel\r\ndown Papa went for him with the club. There never were such larks in\r\nFales\xc3\xa1. The end of it was that Captain Randall knocked over with some\r\nkind of a fit or stroke, and the priest got in his goods after all. But\r\nhe was the angriest priest you ever heard of, and complained to the\r\nchiefs about the outrage, as he called it. That was no account, for our\r\nchiefs are Protestant here; and, anyway, he had been making trouble\r\nabout the drum for morning school, and they were glad to give him a\r\nwipe. Now he swears old Randall gave Adams poison or something, and\r\nwhen the two meet they grin at each other like baboons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe told this story as natural as could be, and like a man that enjoyed\r\nthe fun; though, now I come to think of it after so long, it seems\r\nrather a sickening yarn. However, Case never set up to be soft, only to\r\nbe square and hearty, and a man all round; and, to tell the truth, he\r\npuzzled me entirely.\r\n\r\nI went home and asked Uma if she were a Popey, which I had made out to\r\nbe the native word for Catholics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_E le ai_!\xe2\x80\x9d says she. She always used the native when she meant \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmore than usually strong, and, indeed, there\xe2\x80\x99s more of it. \xe2\x80\x9cNo good\r\nPopey,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\r\n\r\nThen I asked her about Adams and the priest, and she told me much the\r\nsame yarn in her own way. So that I was left not much farther on, but\r\ninclined, upon the whole, to think the bottom of the matter was the row\r\nabout the sacrament, and the poisoning only talk.\r\n\r\nThe next day was a Sunday, when there was no business to be looked for.\r\nUma asked me in the morning if I was going to \xe2\x80\x9cpray\xe2\x80\x9d; I told her she\r\nbet not, and she stopped home herself with no more words. I thought\r\nthis seemed unlike a native, and a native woman, and a woman that had\r\nnew clothes to show off; however, it suited me to the ground, and I\r\nmade the less of it. The queer thing was that I came next door to going\r\nto church after all, a thing I\xe2\x80\x99m little likely to forget. I had turned\r\nout for a stroll, and heard the hymn tune up. You know how it is. If\r\nyou hear folk singing, it seems to draw you; and pretty soon I found\r\nmyself alongside the church. It was a little long low place, coral\r\nbuilt, rounded off at both ends like a whale-boat, a big native roof on\r\nthe top of it, windows without sashes and doorways without doors. I\r\nstuck my head into one of the windows, and the sight was so new to\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94for things went quite different in the islands I was acquainted\r\nwith\xe2\x80\x94that I stayed and looked on. The congregation sat on the floor on\r\nmats, the women on one side, the men on the other, all rigged out to\r\nkill\xe2\x80\x94the women with dresses and trade hats, the men in white jackets\r\nand shirts. The hymn was over; the pastor, a big buck Kanaka, was in\r\nthe pulpit, preaching for his life; and by the way he wagged his hand,\r\nand worked his voice, and made his points, and seemed to argue with the\r\nfolk, I made out he was a gun at the business. Well, he looked up\r\nsuddenly and caught my eye, and I give you my word he staggered in the\r\npulpit; his eyes bulged out of his head, his hand rose and pointed at\r\nme like as if against his will, and the sermon stopped right there.\r\n\r\nIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t a fine thing to say for yourself, but I ran away; and if the\r\nsame kind of a shock was given me, I should run away again to-morrow.\r\nTo see that palavering Kanaka struck all of a heap at the mere sight of\r\nme gave me a feeling as if the bottom had dropped out of the world. I\r\nwent right home, and stayed there, and said nothing. You might think I\r\nwould tell Uma, but that was against my system. You might have thought\r\nI would have gone over and consulted Case; but the truth was I was\r\nashamed to speak of such a thing, I thought everyone would blurt out\r\nlaughing in my face. So I held my tongue, and thought all the more; and\r\nthe more I thought, the less I liked the business.\r\n\r\nBy Monday night I got it clearly in my head I must be tabooed. A new\r\nstore to stand open two days in a village and not a man or woman come\r\nto see the trade was past believing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUma,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99m tabooed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\nI thought awhile whether I should ask her more, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad idea to\r\nset natives up with any notion of consulting them, so I went to Case.\r\nIt was dark, and he was sitting alone, as he did mostly, smoking on the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCase,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s a queer thing. I\xe2\x80\x99m tabooed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, fudge!\xe2\x80\x9d says he; \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tain\xe2\x80\x99t the practice in these islands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be, or it mayn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the practice where I was\r\nbefore. You can bet I know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like; and I tell it you for a\r\nfact, I\xe2\x80\x99m tabooed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat have you been doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to find out,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, you can\xe2\x80\x99t be,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cit ain\xe2\x80\x99t possible. However, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you\r\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99ll do. Just to put your mind at rest, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go round and find out\r\nfor sure. Just you waltz in and talk to Papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather stay right out here on the verandah.\r\nYour house is so close.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll call Papa out here, then,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. The fact is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake to Mr. Randall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCase laughed, took a lantern from the store, and set out into the\r\nvillage. He was gone perhaps a quarter of an hour, and he looked mighty\r\nserious when he came back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, clapping down the lantern on the verandah steps, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwould never have believed it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where the impudence of these\r\nKanakas \xe2\x80\x99ll go next; they seem to have lost all idea of respect for\r\nwhites. What we want is a man-of-war\xe2\x80\x94a German, if we could\xe2\x80\x94they know\r\nhow to manage Kanakas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _am_ tabooed, then?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething of the sort,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the worst thing of the kind\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of yet. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll stand by you, Wiltshire, man to man. You\r\ncome round here to-morrow about nine, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have it out with the\r\nchiefs. They\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of me, or they used to be; but their heads are\r\nso big by now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to think. Understand me, Wiltshire; I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t count this your quarrel,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, with a great deal of\r\nresolution, \xe2\x80\x9cI count it all of our quarrel, I count it the White Man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nQuarrel, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll stand to it through thick and thin, and there\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nhand on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you found out what\xe2\x80\x99s the reason?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Case. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99ll fix them down to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAltogether I was pretty well pleased with his attitude, and almost more\r\nthe next day, when we met to go before the chiefs, to see him so stern\r\nand resolved. The chiefs awaited us in one of their big oval houses,\r\nwhich was marked out to us from a long way off by the crowd about the\r\neaves, a hundred strong if there was one\xe2\x80\x94men, women, and children. Many\r\nof the men were on their way to work and wore green wreaths, and it put\r\nme in thoughts of the 1st of May at home. This crowd opened and buzzed\r\nabout the pair of us as we went in, with a sudden angry animation. Five\r\nchiefs were there; four mighty stately men, the fifth old and puckered.\r\nThey sat on mats in their white kilts and jackets; they had fans in\r\ntheir hands, like fine ladies; and two of the younger ones wore\r\nCatholic medals, which gave me matter of reflection. Our place was set,\r\nand the mats laid for us over against these grandees, on the near side\r\nof the house; the midst was empty; the crowd, close at our backs,\r\nmurmured and craned and jostled to look on, and the shadows of them\r\ntossed in front of us on the clean pebbles of the floor. I was just a\r\nhair put out by the excitement of the commons, but the quiet civil\r\nappearance of the chiefs reassured me, all the more when their\r\nspokesman began and made a long speech in a low tone of voice,\r\nsometimes waving his hand towards Case, sometimes toward me, and\r\nsometimes knocking with his knuckles on the mat. One thing was clear:\r\nthere was no sign of anger in the chiefs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he been saying?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, when he had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, just that they\xe2\x80\x99re glad to see you, and they understand by me you\r\nwish to make some kind of complaint, and you\xe2\x80\x99re to fire away, and\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99ll do the square thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt took a precious long time to say that,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, the rest was sawder and _bonjour_ and that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Case. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know\r\nwhat Kanakas are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they don\xe2\x80\x99t get much _bonjour_ out of me,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cYou tell them\r\nwho I am. I\xe2\x80\x99m a white man, and a British subject, and no end of a big\r\nchief at home; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve come here to do them good, and bring them\r\ncivilisation; and no sooner have I got my trade sorted out than they go\r\nand taboo me, and no one dare come near my place! Tell them I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean to fly in the face of anything legal; and if what they want\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\npresent, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do what\xe2\x80\x99s fair. I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame any man looking out for\r\nhimself, tell them, for that\xe2\x80\x99s human nature; but if they think they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ngoing to come any of their native ideas over me, they\xe2\x80\x99ll find\r\nthemselves mistaken. And tell them plain that I demand the reason of\r\nthis treatment as a white man and a British subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was my speech. I know how to deal with Kanakas: give them plain\r\nsense and fair dealing, and\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll do them that much justice\xe2\x80\x94they knuckle\r\nunder every time. They haven\xe2\x80\x99t any real government or any real law,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to knock into their heads; and even if they had,\r\nit would be a good joke if it was to apply to a white man. It would be\r\na strange thing if we came all this way and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do what we\r\npleased. The mere idea has always put my monkey up, and I rapped my\r\nspeech out pretty big. Then Case translated it\xe2\x80\x94or made believe to,\r\nrather\xe2\x80\x94and the first chief replied, and then a second, and a third, all\r\nin the same style, easy and genteel, but solemn underneath. Once a\r\nquestion was put to Case, and he answered it, and all hands (both\r\nchiefs and commons) laughed out aloud, and looked at me. Last of all,\r\nthe puckered old fellow and the big young chief that spoke first\r\nstarted in to put Case through a kind of catechism. Sometimes I made\r\nout that Case was trying to fence, and they stuck to him like hounds,\r\nand the sweat ran down his face, which was no very pleasant sight to\r\nme, and at some of his answers the crowd moaned and murmured, which was\r\na worse hearing. It\xe2\x80\x99s a cruel shame I knew no native, for (as I now\r\nbelieve) they were asking Case about my marriage, and he must have had\r\na tough job of it to clear his feet. But leave Case alone; he had the\r\nbrains to run a parliament.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, is that all?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, when a pause came.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, mopping his face; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean they won\xe2\x80\x99t take the taboo off?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something queer,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you outside. Better come\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t take it at their hands,\xe2\x80\x9d cried I. \xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t that kind of a man.\r\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t find me turn my back on a parcel of Kanakas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Case.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with a signal in his eye; and the five chiefs looked at\r\nme civilly enough, but kind of pointed; and the people looked at me and\r\ncraned and jostled. I remembered the folks that watched my house, and\r\nhow the pastor had jumped in his pulpit at the bare sight of me; and\r\nthe whole business seemed so out of the way that I rose and followed\r\nCase. The crowd opened again to let us through, but wider than before,\r\nthe children on the skirts running and singing out, and as we two white\r\nmen walked away they all stood and watched us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is all this about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is I can\xe2\x80\x99t rightly make it out myself. They have a down on\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d says Case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTaboo a man because they have a down on him!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI never heard\r\nthe like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s worse than that, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Case. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ain\xe2\x80\x99t tabooed\xe2\x80\x94I told\r\nyou that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be. The people won\xe2\x80\x99t go near you, Wiltshire, and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s where it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey won\xe2\x80\x99t go near me? What do you mean by that? Why won\xe2\x80\x99t they go\r\nnear me?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\nCase hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cSeems they\xe2\x80\x99re frightened,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, in a low voice.\r\n\r\nI stopped dead short. \xe2\x80\x9cFrightened?\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you gone crazy,\r\nCase? What are they frightened of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could make out,\xe2\x80\x9d Case answered, shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cAppears\r\nlike one of their tomfool superstitions. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I don\xe2\x80\x99t cotton\r\nto,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like the business about Vigours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to know what you mean by that, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll trouble you to tell\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you know, Vigours lit out and left all standing,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwas some superstition business\xe2\x80\x94I never got the hang of it but it began\r\nto look bad before the end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a different story about that,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand I had better\r\ntell you so. I heard he ran away because of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! well, I suppose he was ashamed to tell the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d says Case; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nguess he thought it silly. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a fact that I packed him off. \xe2\x80\x98What\r\nwould you do, old man?\xe2\x80\x99 says he. \xe2\x80\x98Get,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98and not think twice\r\nabout it.\xe2\x80\x99 I was the gladdest kind of man to see him clear away. It\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t my notion to turn my back on a mate when he\xe2\x80\x99s in a tight place,\r\nbut there was that much trouble in the village that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nwhere it might likely end. I was a fool to be so much about with\r\nVigours. They cast it up to me to-day. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you hear Maea\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nyoung chief, the big one\xe2\x80\x94ripping out about \xe2\x80\x98Vika\xe2\x80\x99? That was him they\r\nwere after. They don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to forget it, somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is all very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong; it\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t tell me what they\xe2\x80\x99re afraid of\xe2\x80\x94what their idea is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I wish I knew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Case. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say fairer than that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might have asked, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so I did,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you must have seen for yourself, unless\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re blind, that the asking got the other way. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go as far as I\r\ndare for another white man; but when I find I\xe2\x80\x99m in the scrape myself, I\r\nthink first of my own bacon. The loss of me is I\xe2\x80\x99m too good-natured.\r\nAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the freedom of telling you you show a queer kind of\r\ngratitude to a man who\xe2\x80\x99s got into all this mess along of your affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a thing I am thinking of,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cYou were a fool to be so\r\nmuch about with Vigours. One comfort, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been much about with\r\nme. I notice you\xe2\x80\x99ve never been inside my house. Own up now; you had\r\nword of this before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a fact I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was an oversight, and I am\r\nsorry for it, Wiltshire. But about coming now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be quite plain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean you won\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwfully sorry, old man, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the size of it,\xe2\x80\x9d says Case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn short, you\xe2\x80\x99re afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn short, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m still to be tabooed for nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you you\xe2\x80\x99re not tabooed,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Kanakas won\xe2\x80\x99t go near\r\nyou, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. And who\xe2\x80\x99s to make \xe2\x80\x99em? We traders have a lot of gall,\r\nI must say; we make these poor Kanakas take back their laws, and take\r\nup their taboos, and that, whenever it happens to suit us. But you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say you expect a law obliging people to deal in your\r\nstore whether they want to or not? You don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to tell me you\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nthe gall for that? And if you had, it would be a queer thing to propose\r\nto me. I would just like to point out to you, Wiltshire, that I\xe2\x80\x99m a\r\ntrader myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I would talk of gall if I was you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabout what it comes to, as well as I can make out: None of the people\r\nare to trade with me, and they\xe2\x80\x99re all to trade with you. You\xe2\x80\x99re to have\r\nthe copra, and I\xe2\x80\x99m to go to the devil and shake myself. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow any native, and you\xe2\x80\x99re the only man here worth mention that speaks\r\nEnglish, and you have the gall to up and hint to me my life\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\ndanger, and all you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to tell me is you don\xe2\x80\x99t know why!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it _is_ all I have to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I wish I\r\ndid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you turn your back and leave me to myself! Is that the\r\nposition?\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you like to put it nasty,\xe2\x80\x9d says he. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t put it so. I say\r\nmerely, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep clear of you; or, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get in\r\ndanger for myself.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re a nice kind of a white man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I understand; you\xe2\x80\x99re riled,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI would be myself. I can\r\nmake excuses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cgo and make excuses somewhere else. Here\xe2\x80\x99s my\r\nway, there\xe2\x80\x99s yours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that we parted, and I went straight home, in a hot temper, and\r\nfound Uma trying on a lot of trade goods like a baby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou quit that foolery! Here\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty mess to have\r\nmade, as if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t bothered enough anyway! And I thought I told you\r\nto get dinner!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then I believe I gave her a bit of the rough side of my tongue, as\r\nshe deserved. She stood up at once, like a sentry to his officer; for I\r\nmust say she was always well brought up, and had a great respect for\r\nwhites.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou belong round here, you\xe2\x80\x99re bound to understand\r\nthis. What am I tabooed for, anyway? Or, if I ain\xe2\x80\x99t tabooed, what makes\r\nthe folks afraid of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood and looked at me with eyes like saucers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou no savvy?\xe2\x80\x9d she gasps at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cHow would you expect me to? We don\xe2\x80\x99t have any such\r\ncraziness where I come from.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEse no tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked again.\r\n\r\n(_Ese_ was the name the natives had for Case; it may mean foreign, or\r\nextraordinary; or it might mean a mummy apple; but most like it was\r\nonly his own name misheard and put in a Kanaka spelling.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD-n Ese!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried.\r\n\r\nYou might think it funny to hear this Kanaka girl come out with a big\r\nswear. No such thing. There was no swearing in her\xe2\x80\x94no, nor anger; she\r\nwas beyond anger, and meant the word simple and serious. She stood\r\nthere straight as she said it. I cannot justly say that I ever saw a\r\nwoman look like that before or after, and it struck me mum. Then she\r\nmade a kind of an obeisance, but it was the proudest kind, and threw\r\nher hands out open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI \xe2\x80\x99shamed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you savvy. Ese he tell me you savvy, he\r\ntell me you no mind, tell me you love me too much. Taboo belong me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe said, touching herself on the bosom, as she had done upon our\r\nwedding-night. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I go \xe2\x80\x99way, taboo he go \xe2\x80\x99way too. Then you get too\r\nmuch copra. You like more better, I think. _Tof\xc3\xa2_, _alii_,\xe2\x80\x9d says she in\r\nthe native\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, chief!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be in such a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked at me sidelong with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, you get copra,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, the same as you might offer candies to a child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUma,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9chear reason. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact; and Case\r\nseems to have played it pretty mean upon the pair of us. But I do know\r\nnow, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind; I love you too much. You no go \xe2\x80\x99way, you no\r\nleave me, I too much sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou no love me,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cyou talk me bad words!\xe2\x80\x9d And she threw\r\nherself in a corner of the floor, and began to cry.\r\n\r\nWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m no scholar, but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t born yesterday, and I thought the\r\nworst of that trouble was over. However, there she lay\xe2\x80\x94her back turned,\r\nher face to the wall\xe2\x80\x94and shook with sobbing like a little child, so\r\nthat her feet jumped with it. It\xe2\x80\x99s strange how it hits a man when he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin love; for there\xe2\x80\x99s no use mincing things\xe2\x80\x94Kanaka and all, I was in\r\nlove with her, or just as good. I tried to take her hand, but she would\r\nnone of that. \xe2\x80\x9cUma,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no sense in carrying on like\r\nthis. I want you stop here, I want my little wifie, I tell you true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo tell me true,\xe2\x80\x9d she sobbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll wait till you\xe2\x80\x99re through with this.\xe2\x80\x9d And I\r\nsat right down beside her on the floor, and set to smooth her hair with\r\nmy hand. At first she wriggled away when I touched her; then she seemed\r\nto notice me no more; then her sobs grew gradually less, and presently\r\nstopped; and the next thing I knew, she raised her face to mime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou tell me true? You like me stop?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUma,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather have you than all the copra in the South\r\nSeas,\xe2\x80\x9d which was a very big expression, and the strangest thing was\r\nthat I meant it.\r\n\r\nShe threw her arms about me, sprang close up, and pressed her face to\r\nmine in the island way of kissing, so that I was all wetted with her\r\ntears, and my heart went out to her wholly. I never had anything so\r\nnear me as this little brown bit of a girl. Many things went together,\r\nand all helped to turn my head. She was pretty enough to eat; it seemed\r\nshe was my only friend in that queer place; I was ashamed that I had\r\nspoken rough to her: and she was a woman, and my wife, and a kind of a\r\nbaby besides that I was sorry for; and the salt of her tears was in my\r\nmouth. And I forgot Case and the natives; and I forgot that I knew\r\nnothing of the story, or only remembered it to banish the remembrance;\r\nand I forgot that I was to get no copra, and so could make no\r\nlivelihood; and I forgot my employers, and the strange kind of service\r\nI was doing them, when I preferred my fancy to their business; and I\r\nforgot even that Uma was no true wife of mine, but just a maid\r\nbeguiled, and that in a pretty shabby style. But that is to look too\r\nfar on. I will come to that part of it next.\r\n\r\nIt was late before we thought of getting dinner. The stove was out, and\r\ngone stone-cold; but we fired up after a while, and cooked each a dish,\r\nhelping and hindering each other, and making a play of it like\r\nchildren. I was so greedy of her nearness that I sat down to dinner\r\nwith my lass upon my knee, made sure of her with one hand, and ate with\r\nthe other. Ay, and more than that. She was the worst cook I suppose God\r\nmade; the things she set her hand to it would have sickened an honest\r\nhorse to eat of; yet I made my meal that day on Uma\xe2\x80\x99s cookery, and can\r\nnever call to mind to have been better pleased.\r\n\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to myself, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to her. I saw I was\r\nclean gone; and if she was to make a fool of me, she must. And I\r\nsuppose it was this that set her talking, for now she made sure that we\r\nwere friends. A lot she told me, sitting in my lap and eating my dish,\r\nas I ate hers, from foolery\xe2\x80\x94a lot about herself and her mother and\r\nCase, all which would be very tedious, and fill sheets if I set it down\r\nin Beach de Mar, but which I must give a hint of in plain English, and\r\none thing about myself which had a very big effect on my concerns, as\r\nyou are soon to hear.\r\n\r\nIt seems she was born in one of the Line Islands; had been only two or\r\nthree years in these parts, where she had come with a white man, who\r\nwas married to her mother and then died; and only the one year in\r\nFales\xc3\xa1. Before that they had been a good deal on the move, trekking\r\nabout after the white man, who was one of those rolling stones that\r\nkeep going round after a soft job. They talk about looking for gold at\r\nthe end of a rainbow; but if a man wants an employment that\xe2\x80\x99ll last him\r\ntill he dies, let him start out on the soft-job hunt. There\xe2\x80\x99s meat and\r\ndrink in it too, and beer and skittles, for you never hear of them\r\nstarving, and rarely see them sober; and as for steady sport,\r\ncock-fighting isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the same county with it. Anyway, this\r\nbeachcomber carried the woman and her daughter all over the shop, but\r\nmostly to out-of-the-way islands, where there were no police, and he\r\nthought, perhaps, the soft job hung out. I\xe2\x80\x99ve my own view of this old\r\nparty; but I was just as glad he had kept Uma clear of Apia and Papeete\r\nand these flash towns. At last he struck Fale-alii on this island, got\r\nsome trade\xe2\x80\x94the Lord knows how!\xe2\x80\x94muddled it all away in the usual style,\r\nand died worth next to nothing, bar a bit of land at Fales\xc3\xa1 that he had\r\ngot for a bad debt, which was what put it in the minds of the mother\r\nand daughter to come there and live. It seems Case encouraged them all\r\nhe could, and helped to get their house built. He was very kind those\r\ndays, and gave Uma trade, and there is no doubt he had his eye on her\r\nfrom the beginning. However, they had scarce settled, when up turned a\r\nyoung man, a native, and wanted to marry her. He was a small chief, and\r\nhad some fine mats and old songs in his family, and was \xe2\x80\x9cvery pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nUma said; and, altogether, it was an extraordinary match for a\r\npenniless girl and an out-islander.\r\n\r\nAt the first word of this I got downright sick with jealousy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you mean to say you would have married him?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ioe_, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI like too much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd suppose I had come round after?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like you more better now,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, suppose I marry Ioane, I\r\none good wife. I no common Kanaka. Good girl!\xe2\x80\x9d says she.\r\n\r\nWell, I had to be pleased with that; but I promise you I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nabout the business one little bit. And I liked the end of that yarn no\r\nbetter than the beginning. For it seems this proposal of marriage was\r\nthe start of all the trouble. It seems, before that, Uma and her mother\r\nhad been looked down upon, of course, for kinless folk and\r\nout-islanders, but nothing to hurt; and, even when Ioane came forward,\r\nthere was less trouble at first than might have been looked for. And\r\nthen, all of a sudden, about six months before my coming, Ioane backed\r\nout and left that part of the island, and from that day to this Uma and\r\nher mother had found themselves alone. None called at their house, none\r\nspoke to them on the roads. If they went to church, the other women\r\ndrew their mats away and left them in a clear place by themselves. It\r\nwas a regular excommunication, like what you read of in the Middle\r\nAges; and the cause or sense of it beyond guessing. It was some _tala\r\npepelo_, Uma said, some lie, some calumny; and all she knew of it was\r\nthat the girls who had been jealous of her luck with Ioane used to twit\r\nher with his desertion, and cry out, when they met her alone in the\r\nwoods, that she would never be married. \xe2\x80\x9cThey tell me no man he marry\r\nme. He too much \xe2\x80\x99fraid,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nThe only soul that came about them after this desertion was Master\r\nCase. Even he was chary of showing himself, and turned up mostly by\r\nnight; and pretty soon he began to table his cards and make up to Uma.\r\nI was still sore about Ioane, and when Case turned up in the same line\r\nof business I cut up downright rough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, sneering, \xe2\x80\x9cand I suppose you thought Case \xe2\x80\x98very pretty\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand \xe2\x80\x98liked too much\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you talk silly,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cWhite man, he come here, I marry him\r\nall-e-same Kanaka; very well then, he marry me all-e-same white woman.\r\nSuppose he no marry, he go \xe2\x80\x99way, woman he stop. All-e-same thief, empty\r\nhand, Tonga-heart\xe2\x80\x94no can love! Now you come marry me. You big heart\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nno \xe2\x80\x99shamed island-girl. That thing I love you for too much. I proud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that ever I felt sicker all the days of my life. I laid\r\ndown my fork, and I put away \xe2\x80\x9cthe island-girl\xe2\x80\x9d; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem somehow\r\nto have any use for either, and I went and walked up and down in the\r\nhouse, and Uma followed me with her eyes, for she was troubled, and\r\nsmall wonder! But troubled was no word for it with me. I so wanted, and\r\nso feared, to make a clean breast of the sweep that I had been.\r\n\r\nAnd just then there came a sound of singing out of the sea; it sprang\r\nup suddenly clear and near, as the boat turned the headland, and Uma,\r\nrunning to the window, cried out it was \xe2\x80\x9cMisi\xe2\x80\x9d come upon his rounds.\r\n\r\nI thought it was a strange thing I should be glad to have a missionary;\r\nbut, if it was strange, it was still true.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUma,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou stop here in this room, and don\xe2\x80\x99t budge a foot out\r\nof it till I come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nTHE MISSIONARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I came out on the verandah, the mission-boat was shooting for the\r\nmouth of the river. She was a long whale-boat painted white; a bit of\r\nan awning astern; a native pastor crouched on the wedge of the poop,\r\nsteering; some four-and-twenty paddles flashing and dipping, true to\r\nthe boat-song; and the missionary under the awning, in his white\r\nclothes, reading in a book, and set him up! It was pretty to see and\r\nhear; there\xe2\x80\x99s no smarter sight in the islands than a missionary boat\r\nwith a good crew and a good pipe to them; and I considered it for half\r\na minute, with a bit of envy perhaps, and then strolled down towards\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nFrom the opposite side there was another man aiming for the same place,\r\nbut he ran and got there first. It was Case; doubtless his idea was to\r\nkeep me apart from the missionary, who might serve me as interpreter;\r\nbut my mind was upon other things. I was thinking how he had jockeyed\r\nus about the marriage, and tried his hand on Uma before; and at the\r\nsight of him rage flew into my nostrils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet out of that, you low, swindling thief!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that you say?\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\nI gave him the word again, and rammed it down with a good oath. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if\r\never I catch you within six fathoms of my house,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll clap a\r\nbullet in your measly carcase.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must do as you like about your house,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere I told you\r\nI have no thought of going; but this is a public place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a place where I have private business,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no idea\r\nof a hound like you eavesdropping, and I give you notice to clear out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t take it, though,\xe2\x80\x9d says Case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see about that,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nHe was quick with his hands, but he had neither the height nor the\r\nweight, being a flimsy creature alongside a man like me, and, besides,\r\nI was blazing to that height of wrath that I could have bit into a\r\nchisel. I gave him first the one and then the other, so that I could\r\nhear his head rattle and crack, and he went down straight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you had enough?\xe2\x80\x9d cried I. But he only looked up white and blank,\r\nand the blood spread upon his face like wine upon a napkin. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you\r\nhad enough?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried again. \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak up, and don\xe2\x80\x99t lie malingering there,\r\nor I\xe2\x80\x99ll take my feet to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat up at that, and held his head\xe2\x80\x94by the look of him you could see\r\nit was spinning\xe2\x80\x94and the blood poured on his pyjamas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough for this time,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, and he got up staggering, and\r\nwent off by the way that he had come.\r\n\r\nThe boat was close in; I saw the missionary had laid his book to one\r\nside, and I smiled to myself. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll know I\xe2\x80\x99m a man, anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d thinks I.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time, in all my years in the Pacific, I had ever\r\nexchanged two words with any missionary, let alone asked one for a\r\nfavour. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the lot, no trader does; they look down upon us,\r\nand make no concealment; and, besides, they\xe2\x80\x99re partly Kanakaised, and\r\nsuck up with natives instead of with other white men like themselves. I\r\nhad on a rig of clean striped pyjamas\xe2\x80\x94for, of course, I had dressed\r\ndecent to go before the chiefs; but when I saw the missionary step out\r\nof this boat in the regular uniform, white duck clothes, pith helmet,\r\nwhite shirt and tie, and yellow boots to his feet, I could have bunged\r\nstones at him. As he came nearer, queering me pretty curious (because\r\nof the fight, I suppose), I saw he looked mortal sick, for the truth\r\nwas he had a fever on, and had just had a chill in the boat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Tarleton, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d says I, for I had got his name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, I suppose, are the new trader?\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to tell you first that I don\xe2\x80\x99t hold with missions,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand that I think you and the likes of you do a sight of harm, filling\r\nup the natives with old wives\xe2\x80\x99 tales and bumptiousness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are perfectly entitled to your opinions,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, looking a bit\r\nugly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have no call to hear them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt so happens that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to hear them,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no\r\nmissionary, nor missionary lover; I\xe2\x80\x99m no Kanaka, nor favourer of\r\nKanakas\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m just a trader; I\xe2\x80\x99m just a common, low-down, God-damned\r\nwhite man and British subject, the sort you would like to wipe your\r\nboots on. I hope that\xe2\x80\x99s plain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my man,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more plain than creditable. When you are\r\nsober, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be sorry for this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe tried to pass on, but I stopped him with my hand. The Kanakas were\r\nbeginning to growl. Guess they didn\xe2\x80\x99t like my tone, for I spoke to that\r\nman as free as I would to you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, you can\xe2\x80\x99t say I\xe2\x80\x99ve deceived you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand I can go on. I\r\nwant a service\xe2\x80\x94I want two services, in fact; and, if you care to give\r\nme them, I\xe2\x80\x99ll perhaps take more stock in what you call your\r\nChristianity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a moment. Then he smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are rather a strange\r\nsort of man,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the sort of man God made me,\xe2\x80\x9d says I. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t set up to be a\r\ngentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not quite so sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what can I do for you, Mr.\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWiltshire,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I\xe2\x80\x99m mostly called Welsher; but Wiltshire\r\nis the way it\xe2\x80\x99s spelt, if the people on the beach could only get their\r\ntongues about it. And what do I want? Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you the first\r\nthing. I\xe2\x80\x99m what you call a sinner\xe2\x80\x94what I call a sweep\xe2\x80\x94and I want you to\r\nhelp me make it up to a person I\xe2\x80\x99ve deceived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned and spoke to his crew in the native. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now I am at your\r\nservice,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut only for the time my crew are dining. I must be\r\nmuch farther down the coast before night. I was delayed at Papa-Malulu\r\ntill this morning, and I have an engagement in Fale-alii to-morrow\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI led the way to my house in silence, and rather pleased with myself\r\nfor the way I had managed the talk, for I like a man to keep his\r\nself-respect.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was sorry to see you fighting,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the yarn I want to tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservice number two. After you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it you\xe2\x80\x99ll let me know whether\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re sorry or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe walked right in through the store, and I was surprised to find Uma\r\nhad cleared away the dinner things. This was so unlike her ways that I\r\nsaw she had done it out of gratitude, and liked her the better. She and\r\nMr. Tarleton called each other by name, and he was very civil to her\r\nseemingly. But I thought little of that; they can always find civility\r\nfor a Kanaka, it\xe2\x80\x99s us white men they lord it over. Besides, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant much Tarleton just then. I was going to do my pitch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUma,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cgive us your marriage certificate.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked put out.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can trust me. Hand it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had it about her person, as usual; I believe she thought it was a\r\npass to heaven, and if she died without having it handy she would go to\r\nhell. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see where she put it the first time, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nnow where she took it from; it seemed to jump into her hand like that\r\nBlavatsky business in the papers. But it\xe2\x80\x99s the same way with all island\r\nwomen, and I guess they\xe2\x80\x99re taught it when young.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with the certificate in my hand, \xe2\x80\x9cI was married to this\r\ngirl by Black Jack the negro. The certificate was wrote by Case, and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a dandy piece of literature, I promise you. Since then I\xe2\x80\x99ve found\r\nthat there\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of cry in the place against this wife of mine, and\r\nso long as I keep her I cannot trade. Now, what would any man do in my\r\nplace, if he was a man?\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first thing he would do is this,\r\nI guess.\xe2\x80\x9d And I took and tore up the certificate and bunged the pieces\r\non the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Au\xc3\xa9_!\xe2\x80\x9d [2] cried Uma, and began to clap her hands; but I caught one\r\nof them in mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the second thing that he would do,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cif he was what I\r\nwould call a man and you would call a man, Mr. Tarleton, is to bring\r\nthe girl right before you or any other missionary, and to up and say:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I was wrong married to this wife of mine, but I think a heap of her,\r\nand now I want to be married to her right.\xe2\x80\x99 Fire away, Mr. Tarleton.\r\nAnd I guess you\xe2\x80\x99d better do it in native; it\xe2\x80\x99ll please the old lady,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nsaid, giving her the proper name of a man\xe2\x80\x99s wife upon the spot.\r\n\r\nSo we had in two of the crew for to witness, and were spliced in our\r\nown house; and the parson prayed a good bit, I must say\xe2\x80\x94but not so long\r\nas some\xe2\x80\x94and shook hands with the pair of us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Wiltshire,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, when he had made out the lines and packed off\r\nthe witnesses, \xe2\x80\x9cI have to thank you for a very lively pleasure. I have\r\nrarely performed the marriage ceremony with more grateful emotions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was what you would call talking. He was going on, besides, with\r\nmore of it, and I was ready for as much taffy as he had in stock, for I\r\nfelt good. But Uma had been taken up with something half through the\r\nmarriage, and cut straight in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow your hand he get hurt?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ask Case\xe2\x80\x99s head, old lady,\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\nShe jumped with joy, and sang out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t made much of a Christian of this one,\xe2\x80\x9d says I to Mr.\r\nTarleton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t think her one of our worst,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen she was at\r\nFale-alii; and if Uma bears malice I shall be tempted to fancy she has\r\ngood cause.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there we are at service number two,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to tell you\r\nour yarn, and see if you can let a little daylight in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it long?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a goodish bit of a yarn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you all the time I can spare,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, looking at his\r\nwatch. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I must tell you fairly, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t eaten since five this\r\nmorning, and, unless you can let me have something I am not likely to\r\neat again before seven or eight to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God, we\xe2\x80\x99ll give you dinner!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\nI was a little caught up at my swearing, just when all was going\r\nstraight; and so was the missionary, I suppose, but he made believe to\r\nlook out of the window, and thanked us.\r\n\r\nSo we ran him up a bit of a meal. I was bound to let the old lady have\r\na hand in it, to show off, so I deputised her to brew the tea. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink I ever met such tea as she turned out. But that was not the\r\nworst, for she got round with the salt-box, which she considered an\r\nextra European touch, and turned my stew into sea-water. Altogether,\r\nMr. Tarleton had a devil of a dinner of it; but he had plenty\r\nentertainment by the way, for all the while that we were cooking, and\r\nafterwards, when he was making believe to eat, I kept posting him up on\r\nMaster Case and the beach of Fales\xc3\xa1, and he putting questions that\r\nshowed he was following close.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he at last, \xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you have a dangerous enemy. This\r\nman Case is very clever and seems really wicked. I must tell you I have\r\nhad my eye on him for nearly a year, and have rather had the worst of\r\nour encounters. About the time when the last representative of your\r\nfirm ran so suddenly away, I had a letter from Namu, the native pastor,\r\nbegging me to come to Fales\xc3\xa1 at my earliest convenience, as his flock\r\nwere all \xe2\x80\x98adopting Catholic practices.\xe2\x80\x99 I had great confidence in Namu;\r\nI fear it only shows how easily we are deceived. No one could hear him\r\npreach and not be persuaded he was a man of extraordinary parts. All\r\nour islanders easily acquire a kind of eloquence, and can roll out and\r\nillustrate, with a great deal of vigour and fancy, second-hand sermons;\r\nbut Namu\xe2\x80\x99s sermons are his own, and I cannot deny that I have found\r\nthem means of grace. Moreover, he has a keen curiosity in secular\r\nthings, does not fear work, is clever at carpentering, and has made\r\nhimself so much respected among the neighbouring pastors that we call\r\nhim, in a jest which is half serious, the Bishop of the East. In short,\r\nI was proud of the man; all the more puzzled by his letter, and took an\r\noccasion to come this way. The morning before my arrival, Vigours had\r\nbeen sent on board the _Lion_, and Namu was perfectly at his ease,\r\napparently ashamed of his letter, and quite unwilling to explain it.\r\nThis, of course, I could not allow, and he ended by confessing that he\r\nhad been much concerned to find his people using the sign of the cross,\r\nbut since he had learned the explanation his mind was satisfied. For\r\nVigours had the Evil Eye, a common thing in a country of Europe called\r\nItaly, where men were often struck dead by that kind of devil, and it\r\nappeared the sign of the cross was a charm against its power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And I explain it, Misi,\xe2\x80\x99 said Namu, \xe2\x80\x98in this way: The country in\r\nEurope is a Popey country, and the devil of the Evil Eye may be a\r\nCatholic devil, or, at least, used to Catholic ways. So then I reasoned\r\nthus: if this sign of the cross were used in a Popey manner it would be\r\nsinful, but when it is used only to protect men from a devil, which is\r\na thing harmless in itself, the sign too must be, as a bottle is\r\nneither good nor bad, harmless. For the sign is neither good nor bad.\r\nBut if the bottle be full of gin, the gin is bad; and if the sign be\r\nmade in idolatry bad, so is the idolatry.\xe2\x80\x99 And, very like a native\r\npastor, he had a text apposite about the casting out of devils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And who has been telling you about the Evil Eye?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe admitted it was Case. Now, I am afraid you will think me very\r\nnarrow, Mr. Wiltshire, but I must tell you I was displeased, and cannot\r\nthink a trader at all a good man to advise or have an influence upon my\r\npastors. And, besides, there had been some flying talk in the country\r\nof old Adams and his being poisoned, to which I had paid no great heed;\r\nbut it came back to me at the moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And is this Case a man of a sanctified life?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe admitted he was not; for, though he did not drink, he was\r\nprofligate with women, and had no religion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98I think the less you have to do with him the better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is not easy to have the last word with a man like Namu. He was\r\nready in a moment with an illustration. \xe2\x80\x98Misi,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98you have told\r\nme there were wise men, not pastors, not even holy, who knew many\r\nthings useful to be taught\xe2\x80\x94about trees for instance, and beasts, and to\r\nprint books, and about the stones that are burned to make knives of.\r\nSuch men teach you in your college, and you learn from them, but take\r\ncare not to learn to be unholy. Misi, Case is my college.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew not what to say. Mr. Vigours had evidently been driven out of\r\nFales\xc3\xa1 by the machinations of Case and with something not very unlike\r\nthe collusion of my pastor. I called to mind it was Namu who had\r\nreassured me about Adams and traced the rumour to the ill-will of the\r\npriest. And I saw I must inform myself more thoroughly from an\r\nimpartial source. There is an old rascal of a chief here, Faiaso, whom\r\nI dare say you saw to-day at the council; he has been all his life\r\nturbulent and sly, a great fomenter of rebellions, and a thorn in the\r\nside of the mission and the island. For all that he is very shrewd,\r\nand, except in politics or about his own misdemeanours, a teller of the\r\ntruth. I went to his house, told him what I had heard, and besought him\r\nto be frank. I do not think I had ever a more painful interview.\r\nPerhaps you will understand me, Mr. Wiltshire, if I tell you that I am\r\nperfectly serious in these old wives\xe2\x80\x99 tales with which you reproached\r\nme, and as anxious to do well for these islands as you can be to please\r\nand to protect your pretty wife. And you are to remember that I thought\r\nNamu a paragon, and was proud of the man as one of the first ripe\r\nfruits of the mission. And now I was informed that he had fallen in a\r\nsort of dependence upon Case. The beginning of it was not corrupt; it\r\nbegan, doubtless, in fear and respect, produced by trickery and\r\npretence; but I was shocked to find that another element had been\r\nlately added, that Namu helped himself in the store, and was believed\r\nto be deep in Case\xe2\x80\x99s debt. Whatever the trader said, that Namu believed\r\nwith trembling. He was not alone in this; many in the village lived in\r\na similar subjection; but Namu\xe2\x80\x99s case was the most influential, it was\r\nthrough Namu Case had wrought most evil; and with a certain following\r\namong the chiefs, and the pastor in his pocket, the man was as good as\r\nmaster of the village. You know something of Vigours and Adams, but\r\nperhaps you have never heard of old Underhill, Adams\xe2\x80\x99 predecessor. He\r\nwas a quiet, mild old fellow, I remember, and we were told he had died\r\nsuddenly: white men die very suddenly in Fales\xc3\xa1. The truth, as I now\r\nheard it, made my blood run cold. It seems he was struck with a general\r\npalsy, all of him dead but one eye, which he continually winked. Word\r\nwas started that the helpless old man was now a devil, and this vile\r\nfellow Case worked upon the natives\xe2\x80\x99 fears, which he professed to\r\nshare, and pretended he durst not go into the house alone. At last a\r\ngrave was dug, and the living body buried at the far end of the\r\nvillage. Namu, my pastor, whom I had helped to educate, offered up a\r\nprayer at the hateful scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt myself in a very difficult position. Perhaps it was my duty to\r\nhave denounced Namu and had him deposed. Perhaps I think so now, but at\r\nthe time it seemed less clear. He had a great influence, it might prove\r\ngreater than mine. The natives are prone to superstition; perhaps by\r\nstirring them up I might but ingrain and spread these dangerous\r\nfancies. And Namu besides, apart from this novel and accursed\r\ninfluence, was a good pastor, an able man, and spiritually minded.\r\nWhere should I look for a better? How was I to find as good? At that\r\nmoment, with Namu\xe2\x80\x99s failure fresh in my view, the work of my life\r\nappeared a mockery; hope was dead in me. I would rather repair such\r\ntools as I had than go abroad in quest of others that must certainly\r\nprove worse; and a scandal is, at the best, a thing to be avoided when\r\nhumanly possible. Right or wrong, then, I determined on a quiet course.\r\nAll that night I denounced and reasoned with the erring pastor, twitted\r\nhim with his ignorance and want of faith, twitted him with his wretched\r\nattitude, making clean the outside of the cup and platter, callously\r\nhelping at a murder, childishly flying in excitement about a few\r\nchildish, unnecessary, and inconvenient gestures; and long before day I\r\nhad him on his knees and bathed in the tears of what seemed a genuine\r\nrepentance. On Sunday I took the pulpit in the morning, and preached\r\nfrom First Kings, nineteenth, on the fire, the earthquake, and the\r\nvoice, distinguishing the true spiritual power, and referring with such\r\nplainness as I dared to recent events in Fales\xc3\xa1. The effect produced\r\nwas great, and it was much increased when Namu rose in his turn and\r\nconfessed that he had been wanting in faith and conduct, and was\r\nconvinced of sin. So far, then, all was well; but there was one\r\nunfortunate circumstance. It was nearing the time of our \xe2\x80\x98May\xe2\x80\x99 in the\r\nisland, when the native contributions to the missions are received; it\r\nfell in my duty to make a notification on the subject, and this gave my\r\nenemy his chance, by which he was not slow to profit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNews of the whole proceedings must have been carried to Case as soon\r\nas church was over, and the same afternoon he made an occasion to meet\r\nme in the midst of the village. He came up with so much intentness and\r\nanimosity that I felt it would be damaging to avoid him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98So,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, in native, \xe2\x80\x98here is the holy man. He has been preaching\r\nagainst me, but that was not in his heart. He has been preaching upon\r\nthe love of God; but that was not in his heart, it was between his\r\nteeth. Will you know what was in his heart?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94cries he. \xe2\x80\x98I will show it\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x99 And, making a snatch at my head, he made believe to pluck out a\r\ndollar, and held it in the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere went that rumour through the crowd with which Polynesians\r\nreceive a prodigy. As for myself, I stood amazed. The thing was a\r\ncommon conjuring trick which I have seen performed at home a score of\r\ntimes; but how was I to convince the villagers of that? I wished I had\r\nlearned legerdemain instead of Hebrew, that I might have paid the\r\nfellow out with his own coin. But there I was; I could not stand there\r\nsilent, and the best I could find to say was weak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I will trouble you not to lay hands on me again,\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I have no such thought,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98nor will I deprive you of your\r\ndollar. Here it is,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, and flung it at my feet. I am told it lay\r\nwhere it fell three days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must say it was well played, said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! he is clever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Tarleton, \xe2\x80\x9cand you can now see for yourself\r\nhow dangerous. He was a party to the horrid death of the paralytic; he\r\nis accused of poisoning Adams; he drove Vigours out of the place by\r\nlies that might have led to murder; and there is no question but he has\r\nnow made up his mind to rid himself of you. How he means to try we have\r\nno guess; only be sure, it\xe2\x80\x99s something new. There is no end to his\r\nreadiness and invention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe gives himself a sight of trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d says I. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd after all, what\r\nfor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, how many tons of copra may they make in this district?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the\r\nmissionary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay as much as sixty tons,\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is the profit to the local trader?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may call it, three pounds,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you can reckon for yourself how much he does it for,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nTarleton. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the more important thing is to defeat him. It is clear\r\nhe spread some report against Uma, in order to isolate and have his\r\nwicked will of her. Failing of that, and seeing a new rival come upon\r\nthe scene, he used her in a different way. Now, the first point to find\r\nout is about Namu. Uma, when people began to leave you and your mother\r\nalone, what did Namu do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop away all-e-same,\xe2\x80\x9d says Uma.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear the dog has returned to his vomit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Tarleton. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now\r\nwhat am I to do for you? I will speak to Namu, I will warn him he is\r\nobserved; it will be strange if he allow anything to go on amiss when\r\nhe is put upon his guard. At the same time, this precaution may fail,\r\nand then you must turn elsewhere. You have two people at hand to whom\r\nyou might apply. There is, first of all, the priest, who might protect\r\nyou by the Catholic interest; they are a wretchedly small body, but\r\nthey count two chiefs. And then there is old Faiaso. Ah! if it had been\r\nsome years ago you would have needed no one else; but his influence is\r\nmuch reduced, it has gone into Maea\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and Maea, I fear, is one\r\nof Case\xe2\x80\x99s jackals. In fine, if the worst comes to the worst, you must\r\nsend up or come yourself to Fale-alii, and, though I am not due at this\r\nend of the island for a month, I will just see what can be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Tarleton said farewell; and half an hour later the crew were\r\nsinging and the paddles flashing in the missionary-boat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nDEVIL-WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nNear a month went by without much doing. The same night of our marriage\r\nGaloshes called round, and made himself mighty civil, and got into a\r\nhabit of dropping in about dark and smoking his pipe with the family.\r\nHe could talk to Uma, of course, and started to teach me native and\r\nFrench at the same time. He was a kind old buffer, though the dirtiest\r\nyou would wish to see, and he muddled me up with foreign languages\r\nworse than the tower of Babel.\r\n\r\nThat was one employment we had, and it made me feel less lonesome; but\r\nthere was no profit in the thing, for though the priest came and sat\r\nand yarned, none of his folks could be enticed into my store; and if it\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for the other occupation I struck out, there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nbeen a pound of copra in the house. This was the idea: Fa\xe2\x80\x99avao (Uma\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother) had a score of bearing trees. Of course we could get no labour,\r\nbeing all as good as tabooed, and the two women and I turned to and\r\nmade copra with our own hands. It was copra to make your mouth water\r\nwhen it was done\xe2\x80\x94I never understood how much the natives cheated me\r\ntill I had made that four hundred pounds of my own hand\xe2\x80\x94and it weighed\r\nso light I felt inclined to take and water it myself.\r\n\r\nWhen we were at the job a good many Kanakas used to put in the best of\r\nthe day looking on, and once that nigger turned up. He stood back with\r\nthe natives and laughed and did the big don and the funny dog, till I\r\nbegan to get riled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, you nigger!\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t address myself to you, Sah,\xe2\x80\x9d says the nigger. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly speak to\r\ngen\xe2\x80\x99le\xe2\x80\x99um.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it happens I was addressing myself to you, Mr.\r\nBlack Jack. And all I want to know is just this: did you see Case\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfigurehead about a week ago?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Sah,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right, then,\xe2\x80\x9d says I; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the own brother to\r\nit, only black, in the inside of about two minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd I began to walk towards him, quite slow, and my hands down; only\r\nthere was trouble in my eye, if anybody took the pains to look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a low, obstropulous fellow, Sah,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet!\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\nBy that time he thought I was about as near as convenient, and lit out\r\nso it would have done your heart good to see him travel. And that was\r\nall I saw of that precious gang until what I am about to tell you.\r\n\r\nIt was one of my chief employments these days to go pot-hunting in the\r\nwoods, which I found (as Case had told me) very rich in game. I have\r\nspoken of the cape which shut up the village and my station from the\r\neast. A path went about the end of it, and led into the next bay. A\r\nstrong wind blew here daily, and as the line of the barrier reef\r\nstopped at the end of the cape, a heavy surf ran on the shores of the\r\nbay. A little cliffy hill cut the valley in two parts, and stood close\r\non the beach; and at high water the sea broke right on the face of it,\r\nso that all passage was stopped. Woody mountains hemmed the place all\r\nround; the barrier to the east was particularly steep and leafy, the\r\nlower parts of it, along the sea, falling in sheer black cliffs\r\nstreaked with cinnabar; the upper part lumpy with the tops of the great\r\ntrees. Some of the trees were bright green, and some red, and the sand\r\nof the beach as black as your shoes. Many birds hovered round the bay,\r\nsome of them snow-white; and the flying-fox (or vampire) flew there in\r\nbroad daylight, gnashing its teeth.\r\n\r\nFor a long while I came as far as this shooting, and went no farther.\r\nThere was no sign of any path beyond, and the cocoa-palms in the front\r\nof the foot of the valley were the last this way. For the whole \xe2\x80\x9ceye\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nof the island, as natives call the windward end, lay desert. From\r\nFales\xc3\xa1 round about to Papa-malulu, there was neither house, nor man,\r\nnor planted fruit-tree; and the reef being mostly absent, and the\r\nshores bluff, the sea beat direct among crags, and there was scarce a\r\nlanding-place.\r\n\r\nI should tell you that after I began to go in the woods, although no\r\none offered to come near my store, I found people willing enough to\r\npass the time of day with me where nobody could see them; and as I had\r\nbegun to pick up native, and most of them had a word or two of English,\r\nI began to hold little odds and ends of conversation, not to much\r\npurpose to be sure, but they took off the worst of the feeling, for\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a miserable thing to be made a leper of.\r\n\r\nIt chanced one day towards the end of the month, that I was sitting in\r\nthis bay in the edge of the bush, looking east, with a Kanaka. I had\r\ngiven him a fill of tobacco, and we were making out to talk as best we\r\ncould; indeed, he had more English than most.\r\n\r\nI asked him if there was no road going eastward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne time one road,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cNow he dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody he go there?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo good,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cToo much devil he stop there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho!\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cgot-um plenty devil, that bush?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMan devil, woman devil; too much devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said my friend. \xe2\x80\x9cStop there\r\nall-e-time. Man he go there, no come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought if this fellow was so well posted on devils and spoke of them\r\nso free, which is not common, I had better fish for a little\r\ninformation about myself and Uma.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think me one devil?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo think devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said he soothingly. \xe2\x80\x9cThink all-e-same fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUma, she devil?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; no devil. Devil stop bush,\xe2\x80\x9d said the young man.\r\n\r\nI was looking in front of me across the bay, and I saw the hanging\r\nfront of the woods pushed suddenly open, and Case, with a gun in his\r\nhand, step forth into the sunshine on the black beach. He was got up in\r\nlight pyjamas, near white, his gun sparkled, he looked mighty\r\nconspicuous; and the land-crabs scuttled from all round him to their\r\nholes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHullo, my friend!\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou no talk all-e-same true. Ese he go, he\r\ncome back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEse no all-e-same; Ese _Tiapolo_,\xe2\x80\x9d says my friend; and, with a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d slunk off among the trees.\r\n\r\nI watched Case all round the beach, where the tide was low; and let him\r\npass me on the homeward way to Fales\xc3\xa1. He was in deep thought, and the\r\nbirds seemed to know it, trotting quite near him on the sand, or\r\nwheeling and calling in his ears. When he passed me I could see by the\r\nworking of his lips that he was talking to himself, and what pleased me\r\nmightily, he had still my trade mark on his brow, I tell you the plain\r\ntruth: I had a mind to give him a gunful in his ugly mug, but I thought\r\nbetter of it.\r\n\r\nAll this time, and all the time I was following home, I kept repeating\r\nthat native word, which I remembered by \xe2\x80\x9cPolly, put the kettle on and\r\nmake us all some tea,\xe2\x80\x9d tea-a-pollo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUma,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, when I got back, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does _Tiapolo_ mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDevil,\xe2\x80\x9d says she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought _aitu_ was the word for that,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Aitu_ \xe2\x80\x99nother kind of devil,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cstop bush, eat Kanaka.\r\nTiapolo big chief devil, stop home; all-e-same Christian devil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no farther forward. How can Case be Tiapolo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo all-e-same,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cEse belong Tiapolo; Tiapolo too much like;\r\nEse all-e-same his son. Suppose Ese he wish something, Tiapolo he make\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s mighty convenient for Ese,\xe2\x80\x9d says I. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what kind of things\r\ndoes he make for him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, out came a rigmarole of all sorts of stories, many of which (like\r\nthe dollar he took from Mr. Tarleton\xe2\x80\x99s head) were plain enough to me,\r\nbut others I could make nothing of; and the thing that most surprised\r\nthe Kanakas was what surprised me least\xe2\x80\x94namely, that he would go in the\r\ndesert among all the _aitus_. Some of the boldest, however, had\r\naccompanied him, and had heard him speak with the dead and give them\r\norders, and, safe in his protection, had returned unscathed. Some said\r\nhe had a church there, where he worshipped Tiapolo, and Tiapolo\r\nappeared to him; others swore that there was no sorcery at all, that he\r\nperformed his miracles by the power of prayer, and the church was no\r\nchurch, but a prison, in which he had confined a dangerous _aitu_. Namu\r\nhad been in the bush with him once, and returned glorifying God for\r\nthese wonders. Altogether, I began to have a glimmer of the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nposition, and the means by which he had acquired it, and, though I saw\r\nhe was a tough nut to crack, I was noways cast down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have a look at Master Case\xe2\x80\x99s place of\r\nworship myself, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see about the glorifying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this Uma fell in a terrible taking; if I went in the high bush I\r\nshould never return; none could go there but by the protection of\r\nTiapolo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll chance it on God\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a good sort of a fellow, Uma,\r\nas fellows go, and I guess God\xe2\x80\x99ll con me through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a while. \xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, mighty solemn\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthen, presently\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cVictoreea, he big chief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet!\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe like you too much?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked again.\r\n\r\nI told her, with a grin, I believed the old lady was rather partial to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cVictoreea he big chief, like you too much. No\r\ncan help you here in Fales\xc3\xa1; no can do\xe2\x80\x94too far off. Maea he small\r\nchief\xe2\x80\x94stop here. Suppose he like you\xe2\x80\x94make you all right. All-e-same God\r\nand Tiapolo. God he big chief\xe2\x80\x94got too much work. Tiapolo he small\r\nchief\xe2\x80\x94he like too much make-see, work very hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have to hand you over to Mr. Tarleton,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cYour theology\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nout of its bearings, Uma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, we stuck to this business all the evening, and, with the\r\nstories she told me of the desert and its dangers, she came near\r\nfrightening herself into a fit. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember half a quarter of\r\nthem, of course, for I paid little heed; but two come back to me kind\r\nof clear.\r\n\r\nAbout six miles up the coast there is a sheltered cove they call\r\n_Fanga-anaana_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe haven full of caves.\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it from the sea\r\nmyself, as near as I could get my boys to venture in; and it\xe2\x80\x99s a little\r\nstrip of yellow sand. Black cliffs overhang it, full of the black\r\nmouths of caves; great trees overhang the cliffs, and dangle-down\r\nlianas; and in one place, about the middle, a big brook pours over in a\r\ncascade. Well, there was a boat going by here, with six young men of\r\nFales\xc3\xa1, \xe2\x80\x9call very pretty,\xe2\x80\x9d Uma said, which was the loss of them. It\r\nblew strong, there was a heavy head sea, and by the time they opened\r\nFanga-anaana, and saw the white cascade and the shady beach, they were\r\nall tired and thirsty, and their water had run out. One proposed to\r\nland and get a drink, and, being reckless fellows, they were all of the\r\nsame mind except the youngest. Lotu was his name; he was a very good\r\nyoung gentleman, and very wise; and he held out that they were crazy,\r\ntelling them the place was given over to spirits and devils and the\r\ndead, and there were no living folk nearer than six miles the one way,\r\nand maybe twelve the other. But they laughed at his words, and, being\r\nfive to one, pulled in, beached the boat, and landed. It was a\r\nwonderful pleasant place, Lotu said, and the water excellent. They\r\nwalked round the beach, but could see nowhere any way to mount the\r\ncliffs, which made them easier in their mind; and at last they sat down\r\nto make a meal on the food they had brought with them. They were scarce\r\nset, when there came out of the mouth of one of the black caves six of\r\nthe most beautiful ladies ever seen: they had flowers in their hair,\r\nand the most beautiful breasts, and necklaces of scarlet seeds; and\r\nbegan to jest with these young gentlemen, and the young gentlemen to\r\njest back with them, all but Lotu. As for Lotu, he saw there could be\r\nno living woman in such a place, and ran, and flung himself in the\r\nbottom of the boat, and covered his face, and prayed. All the time the\r\nbusiness lasted Lotu made one clean break of prayer, and that was all\r\nhe knew of it, until his friends came back, and made him sit up, and\r\nthey put to sea again out of the bay, which was now quite desert, and\r\nno word of the six ladies. But, what frightened Lotu most, not one of\r\nthe five remembered anything of what had passed, but they were all like\r\ndrunken men, and sang and laughed in the boat, and skylarked. The wind\r\nfreshened and came squally, and the sea rose extraordinary high; it was\r\nsuch weather as any man in the islands would have turned his back to\r\nand fled home to Fales\xc3\xa1; but these five were like crazy folk, and\r\ncracked on all sail and drove their boat into the seas. Lotu went to\r\nthe bailing; none of the others thought to help him, but sang and\r\nskylarked and carried on, and spoke singular things beyond a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomprehension, and laughed out loud when they said them. So the rest of\r\nthe day Lotu bailed for his life in the bottom of the boat, and was all\r\ndrenched with sweat and cold sea-water; and none heeded him. Against\r\nall expectation, they came safe in a dreadful tempest to Papa-malulu,\r\nwhere the palms were singing out, and the cocoa-nuts flying like\r\ncannon-balls about the village green; and the same night the five young\r\ngentlemen sickened, and spoke never a reasonable word until they died.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you mean to tell me you can swallow a yarn like that?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\nShe told me the thing was well known, and with handsome young men alone\r\nit was even common; but this was the only case where five had been\r\nslain the same day and in a company by the love of the women-devils;\r\nand it had made a great stir in the island, and she would be crazy if\r\nshe doubted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou needn\xe2\x80\x99t be frightened about me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\nuse for the women-devils. You\xe2\x80\x99re all the women I want, and all the\r\ndevil too, old lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this she answered there were other sorts, and she had seen one with\r\nher own eyes. She had gone one day alone to the next bay, and, perhaps,\r\ngot too near the margin of the bad place. The boughs of the high bush\r\novershadowed her from the cant of the hill, but she herself was outside\r\non a flat place, very stony and growing full of young mummy-apples four\r\nand five feet high. It was a dark day in the rainy season, and now\r\nthere came squalls that tore off the leaves and sent them flying, and\r\nnow it was all still as in a house. It was in one of these still times\r\nthat a whole gang of birds and flying foxes came pegging out of the\r\nbush like creatures frightened. Presently after she heard a rustle\r\nnearer hand, and saw, coming out of the margin of the trees, among the\r\nmummy-apples, the appearance of a lean grey old boar. It seemed to\r\nthink as it came, like a person; and all of a sudden, as she looked at\r\nit coming, she was aware it was no boar but a thing that was a man with\r\na man\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts. At that she ran, and the pig after her, and as the\r\npig ran it holla\xe2\x80\x99d aloud, so that the place rang with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had been there with my gun,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess that pig would\r\nhave holla\xe2\x80\x99d so as to surprise himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she told me a gun was of no use with the like of these, which were\r\nthe spirits of the dead.\r\n\r\nWell, this kind of talk put in the evening, which was the best of it;\r\nbut of course it didn\xe2\x80\x99t change my notion, and the next day, with my gun\r\nand a good knife, I set off upon a voyage of discovery. I made, as near\r\nas I could, for the place where I had seen Case come out; for if it was\r\ntrue he had some kind of establishment in the bush I reckoned I should\r\nfind a path. The beginning of the desert was marked off by a wall, to\r\ncall it so, for it was more of a long mound of stones. They say it\r\nreaches right across the island, but how they know it is another\r\nquestion, for I doubt if anyone has made the journey in a hundred\r\nyears, the natives sticking chiefly to the sea and their little\r\ncolonies along the coast, and that part being mortal high and steep and\r\nfull of cliffs. Up to the west side of the wall, the ground has been\r\ncleared, and there are cocoa palms and mummy-apples and guavas, and\r\nlots of sensitive plants. Just across, the bush begins outright; high\r\nbush at that, trees going up like the masts of ships, and ropes of\r\nliana hanging down like a ship\xe2\x80\x99s rigging, and nasty orchids growing in\r\nthe forks like funguses. The ground where there was no underwood looked\r\nto be a heap of boulders. I saw many green pigeons which I might have\r\nshot, only I was there with a different idea. A number of butterflies\r\nflopped up and down along the ground like dead leaves; sometimes I\r\nwould hear a bird calling, sometimes the wind overhead, and always the\r\nsea along the coast.\r\n\r\nBut the queerness of the place it\xe2\x80\x99s more difficult to tell of, unless\r\nto one who has been alone in the high bush himself. The brightest kind\r\nof a day it is always dim down there. A man can see to the end of\r\nnothing; whichever way he looks the wood shuts up, one bough folding\r\nwith another like the fingers of your hand; and whenever he listens he\r\nhears always something new\xe2\x80\x94men talking, children laughing, the strokes\r\nof an axe a far way ahead of him, and sometimes a sort of a quick,\r\nstealthy scurry near at hand that makes him jump and look to his\r\nweapons. It\xe2\x80\x99s all very well for him to tell himself that he\xe2\x80\x99s alone,\r\nbar trees and birds; he can\xe2\x80\x99t make out to believe it; whichever way he\r\nturns the whole place seems to be alive and looking on. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\r\nwas Uma\xe2\x80\x99s yarns that put me out; I don\xe2\x80\x99t value native talk a\r\nfourpenny-piece; it\xe2\x80\x99s a thing that\xe2\x80\x99s natural in the bush, and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe end of it.\r\n\r\nAs I got near the top of the hill, for the ground of the wood goes up\r\nin this place steep as a ladder, the wind began to sound straight on,\r\nand the leaves to toss and switch open and let in the sun. This suited\r\nme better; it was the same noise all the time, and nothing to startle.\r\nWell, I had got to a place where there was an underwood of what they\r\ncall wild cocoanut\xe2\x80\x94mighty pretty with its scarlet fruit\xe2\x80\x94when there came\r\na sound of singing in the wind that I thought I had never heard the\r\nlike of. It was all very fine to tell myself it was the branches; I\r\nknew better. It was all very fine to tell myself it was a bird; I knew\r\nnever a bird that sang like that. It rose and swelled, and died away\r\nand swelled again; and now I thought it was like someone weeping, only\r\nprettier; and now I thought it was like harps; and there was one thing\r\nI made sure of, it was a sight too sweet to be wholesome in a place\r\nlike that. You may laugh if you like; but I declare I called to mind\r\nthe six young ladies that came, with their scarlet necklaces, out of\r\nthe cave at Fanga-anaana, and wondered if they sang like that. We laugh\r\nat the natives and their superstitions; but see how many traders take\r\nthem up, splendidly educated white men, that have been book-keepers\r\n(some of them) and clerks in the old country. It\xe2\x80\x99s my belief a\r\nsuperstition grows up in a place like the different kind of weeds; and\r\nas I stood there and listened to that wailing I twittered in my shoes.\r\n\r\nYou may call me a coward to be frightened; I thought myself brave\r\nenough to go on ahead. But I went mighty carefully, with my gun cocked,\r\nspying all about me like a hunter, fully expecting to see a handsome\r\nyoung woman sitting somewhere in the bush, and fully determined (if I\r\ndid) to try her with a charge of duck-shot. And sure enough, I had not\r\ngone far when I met with a queer thing. The wind came on the top of the\r\nwood in a strong puff, the leaves in front of me burst open, and I saw\r\nfor a second something hanging in a tree. It was gone in a wink, the\r\npuff blowing by and the leaves closing. I tell you the truth: I had\r\nmade up my mind to see an _aitu_; and if the thing had looked like a\r\npig or a woman, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have given me the same turn. The trouble\r\nwas that it seemed kind of square, and the idea of a square thing that\r\nwas alive and sang knocked me sick and silly. I must have stood quite a\r\nwhile; and I made pretty certain it was right out of the same tree that\r\nthe singing came. Then I began to come to myself a bit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cif this is really so, if this is a place where there\r\nare square things that sing, I\xe2\x80\x99m gone up anyway. Let\xe2\x80\x99s have my fun for\r\nmy money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I thought I might as well take the off chance of a prayer being any\r\ngood; so I plumped on my knees and prayed out loud; and all the time I\r\nwas praying the strange sounds came out of the tree, and went up and\r\ndown, and changed, for all the world like music, only you could see it\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t human\xe2\x80\x94there was nothing there that you could whistle.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had made an end in proper style, I laid down my gun, stuck\r\nmy knife between my teeth, walked right up to that tree, and began to\r\nclimb. I tell you my heart was like ice. But presently, as I went up, I\r\ncaught another glimpse of the thing, and that relieved me, for I\r\nthought it seemed like a box; and when I had got right up to it I near\r\nfell out of the tree with laughing.\r\n\r\nA box it was, sure enough, and a candle-box at that, with the brand\r\nupon the side of it; and it had banjo strings stretched so as to sound\r\nwhen the wind blew. I believe they call the thing a Tyrolean [3] harp,\r\nwhatever that may mean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Case,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve frightened me once, but I defy you to\r\nfrighten me again,\xe2\x80\x9d I says, and slipped down the tree, and set out\r\nagain to find my enemy\xe2\x80\x99s head office, which I guessed would not be far\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe undergrowth was thick in this part; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see before my nose,\r\nand must burst my way through by main force and ply the knife as I\r\nwent, slicing the cords of the lianas and slashing down whole trees at\r\na blow. I call them trees for the bigness, but in truth they were just\r\nbig weeds, and sappy to cut through like carrot. From all this crowd\r\nand kind of vegetation, I was just thinking to myself, the place might\r\nhave once been cleared, when I came on my nose over a pile of stones,\r\nand saw in a moment it was some kind of a work of man. The Lord knows\r\nwhen it was made or when deserted, for this part of the island has lain\r\nundisturbed since long before the whites came. A few steps beyond I hit\r\ninto the path I had been always looking for. It was narrow, but well\r\nbeaten, and I saw that Case had plenty of disciples. It seems, indeed,\r\nit was a piece of fashionable boldness to venture up here with the\r\ntrader, and a young man scarce reckoned himself grown till he had got\r\nhis breech tattooed, for one thing, and seen Case\xe2\x80\x99s devils for another.\r\nThis is mighty like Kanakas; but, if you look at it another way, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmighty like white folks too.\r\n\r\nA bit along the path I was brought to a clear stand, and had to rub my\r\neyes. There was a wall in front of me, the path passing it by a gap; it\r\nwas tumbledown and plainly very old, but built of big stones very well\r\nlaid; and there is no native alive to-day upon that island that could\r\ndream of such a piece of building. Along all the top of it was a line\r\nof queer figures, idols or scarecrows, or what not. They had carved and\r\npainted faces ugly to view, their eyes and teeth were of shell, their\r\nhair and their bright clothes blew in the wind, and some of them worked\r\nwith the tugging. There are islands up west where they make these kind\r\nof figures till to-day; but if ever they were made in this island, the\r\npractice and the very recollection of it are now long forgotten. And\r\nthe singular thing was that all these bogies were as fresh as toys out\r\nof a shop.\r\n\r\nThen it came in my mind that Case had let out to me the first day that\r\nhe was a good forger of island curiosities, a thing by which so many\r\ntraders turn an honest penny. And with that I saw the whole business,\r\nand how this display served the man a double purpose: first of all, to\r\nseason his curiosities, and then to frighten those that came to visit\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut I should tell you (what made the thing more curious) that all the\r\ntime the Tyrolean harps were harping round me in the trees, and even\r\nwhile I looked, a green-and-yellow bird (that, I suppose, was building)\r\nbegan to tear the hair off the head of one of the figures.\r\n\r\nA little farther on I found the best curiosity of the museum. The first\r\nI saw of it was a longish mound of earth with a twist to it. Digging\r\noff the earth with my hands, I found underneath tarpaulin stretched on\r\nboards, so that this was plainly the roof of a cellar. It stood right\r\non the top of the hill, and the entrance was on the far side, between\r\ntwo rocks, like the entrance to a cave. I went as far in as the bend,\r\nand, looking round the corner, saw a shining face. It was big and ugly,\r\nlike a pantomime mask, and the brightness of it waxed and dwindled, and\r\nat times it smoked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho!\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cluminous paint!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd I must say I rather admired the man\xe2\x80\x99s ingenuity. With a box of\r\ntools and a few mighty simple contrivances he had made out to have a\r\ndevil of a temple. Any poor Kanaka brought up here in the dark, with\r\nthe harps whining all round him, and shown that smoking face in the\r\nbottom of a hole, would make no kind of doubt but he had seen and heard\r\nenough devils for a lifetime. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to find out what Kanakas think.\r\nJust go back to yourself any way round from ten to fifteen years old,\r\nand there\xe2\x80\x99s an average Kanaka. There are some pious, just as there are\r\npious boys; and the most of them, like the boys again, are middling\r\nhonest and yet think it rather larks to steal, and are easy scared and\r\nrather like to be so. I remember a boy I was at school with at home who\r\nplayed the Case business. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything, that boy; he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything; he had no luminous paint and no Tyrolean harps;\r\nhe just boldly said he was a sorcerer, and frightened us out of our\r\nboots, and we loved it. And then it came in my mind how the master had\r\nonce flogged that boy, and the surprise we were all in to see the\r\nsorcerer catch it and bum like anybody else. Thinks I to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nmust find some way of fixing it so for Master Case.\xe2\x80\x9d And the next\r\nmoment I had my idea.\r\n\r\nI went back by the path, which, when once you had found it, was quite\r\nplain and easy walking; and when I stepped out on the black sands, who\r\nshould I see but Master Case himself. I cocked my gun and held it\r\nhandy, and we marched up and passed without a word, each keeping the\r\ntail of his eye on the other; and no sooner had we passed than we each\r\nwheeled round like fellows drilling, and stood face to face. We had\r\neach taken the same notion in his head, you see, that the other fellow\r\nmight give him the load of his gun in the stern.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve shot nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d says Case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not on the shoot to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the devil go with you for me,\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same to you,\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\nBut we stuck just the way we were; no fear of either of us moving.\r\n\r\nCase laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t stop here all day, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let me detain you,\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\nHe laughed again. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Wiltshire, do you think me a fool?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore of a knave, if you want to know,\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, do you think it would better me to shoot you here, on this open\r\nbeach?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I don\xe2\x80\x99t. Folks come fishing every day. There\r\nmay be a score of them up the valley now, making copra; there might be\r\nhalf a dozen on the hill behind you, after pigeons; they might be\r\nwatching us this minute, and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder. I give you my word I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to shoot you. Why should I? You don\xe2\x80\x99t hinder me any. You\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t got one pound of copra but what you made with your own hands,\r\nlike a negro slave. You\xe2\x80\x99re vegetating\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what I call it\xe2\x80\x94and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare where you vegetate, nor yet how long. Give me your word you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmean to shoot me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a lead and walk away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re frank and pleasant, ain\xe2\x80\x99t you? And I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the\r\nsame. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to shoot you to-day. Why should I? This business is\r\nbeginning; it ain\xe2\x80\x99t done yet, Mr. Case. I\xe2\x80\x99ve given you one turn\r\nalready; I can see the marks of my knuckles on your head to this\r\nblooming hour, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve more cooking for you. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a paralee, like\r\nUnderhill. My name ain\xe2\x80\x99t Adams, and it ain\xe2\x80\x99t Vigours; and I mean to\r\nshow you that you\xe2\x80\x99ve met your match.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a silly way to talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not the talk to make\r\nme move on with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cstay where you are. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t in any hurry, and you\r\nknow it. I can put in a day on this beach and never mind. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t got\r\nany copra to bother with. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t got any luminous paint to see to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was sorry I said that last, but it whipped out before I knew. I could\r\nsee it took the wind out of his sails, and he stood and stared at me\r\nwith his brow drawn up. Then I suppose he made up his mind he must get\r\nto the bottom of this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take you at your word,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, and turned his back, and walked\r\nright into the devil\xe2\x80\x99s bush.\r\n\r\nI let him go, of course, for I had passed my word. But I watched him as\r\nlong as he was in sight, and after he was gone lit out for cover as\r\nlively as you would want to see, and went the rest of the way home\r\nunder the bush, for I didn\xe2\x80\x99t trust him sixpence-worth. One thing I saw,\r\nI had been ass enough to give him warning, and that which I meant to do\r\nI must do at once.\r\n\r\nYou would think I had had about enough excitement for one morning, but\r\nthere was another turn waiting me. As soon as I got far enough round\r\nthe cape to see my house I made out there were strangers there; a\r\nlittle farther, and no doubt about it. There was a couple of armed\r\nsentinels squatting at my door. I could only suppose the trouble about\r\nUma must have come to a head, and the station been seized. For aught I\r\ncould think, Uma was taken up already, and these armed men were waiting\r\nto do the like with me.\r\n\r\nHowever, as I came nearer, which I did at top speed, I saw there was a\r\nthird native sitting on the verandah like a guest, and Uma was talking\r\nwith him like a hostess. Nearer still I made out it was the big young\r\nchief, Maea, and that he was smiling away and smoking. And what was he\r\nsmoking? None of your European cigarettes fit for a cat, not even the\r\ngenuine big, knock-me-down native article that a fellow can really put\r\nin the time with if his pipe is broke\xe2\x80\x94but a cigar, and one of my\r\nMexicans at that, that I could swear to. At sight of this my heart\r\nstarted beating, and I took a wild hope in my head that the trouble was\r\nover, and Maea had come round.\r\n\r\nUma pointed me out to him as I came up, and he met me at the head of my\r\nown stairs like a thorough gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVilivili,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, which was the best they could make of my name, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\npleased.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt when an island chief wants to be civil he can do it.\r\nI saw the way things were from the word go. There was no call for Uma\r\nto say to me: \xe2\x80\x9cHe no \xe2\x80\x99fraid Ese now, come bring copra.\xe2\x80\x9d I tell you I\r\nshook hands with that Kanaka like as if he was the best white man in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, Case and he had got after the same girl; or Maea\r\nsuspected it, and concluded to make hay of the trader on the chance. He\r\nhad dressed himself up, got a couple of his retainers cleaned and armed\r\nto kind of make the thing more public, and, just waiting till Case was\r\nclear of the village, came round to put the whole of his business my\r\nway. He was rich as well as powerful. I suppose that man was worth\r\nfifty thousand nuts per annum. I gave him the price of the beach and a\r\nquarter cent better, and as for credit, I would have advanced him the\r\ninside of the store and the fittings besides, I was so pleased to see\r\nhim. I must say he bought like a gentleman: rice and tins and biscuits\r\nenough for a week\xe2\x80\x99s feast, and stuffs by the bolt. He was agreeable\r\nbesides; he had plenty fun to him; and we cracked jests together,\r\nmostly through the interpreter, because he had mighty little English,\r\nand my native was still off colour. One thing I made out: he could\r\nnever really have thought much harm of Uma; he could never have been\r\nreally frightened, and must just have made believe from dodginess, and\r\nbecause he thought Case had a strong pull in the village and could help\r\nhim on.\r\n\r\nThis set me thinking that both he and I were in a tightish place. What\r\nhe had done was to fly in the face of the whole village, and the thing\r\nmight cost him his authority. More than that, after my talk with Case\r\non the beach, I thought it might very well cost me my life. Case had as\r\ngood as said he would pot me if ever I got any copra; he would come\r\nhome to find the best business in the village had changed hands; and\r\nthe best thing I thought I could do was to get in first with the\r\npotting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here, Uma,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9ctell him I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I made him wait, but I was\r\nup looking at Case\xe2\x80\x99s Tiapolo store in the bush.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe want savvy if you no \xe2\x80\x99fraid?\xe2\x80\x9d translated Uma.\r\n\r\nI laughed out. \xe2\x80\x9cNot much!\xe2\x80\x9d says I. \xe2\x80\x9cTell him the place is a blooming\r\ntoy-shop! Tell him in England we give these things to the kids to play\r\nwith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe want savvy if you hear devil sing?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t do it now because I\xe2\x80\x99ve got no\r\nbanjo-strings in stock; but the next time the ship comes round I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nhave one of these same contraptions right here in my verandah, and he\r\ncan see for himself how much devil there is to it. Tell him, as soon as\r\nI can get the strings I\xe2\x80\x99ll make one for his picaninnies. The name of\r\nthe concern is a Tyrolean harp; and you can tell him the name means in\r\nEnglish that nobody but dam-fools give a cent for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time he was so pleased he had to try his English again. \xe2\x80\x9cYou talk\r\ntrue?\xe2\x80\x9d says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cTalk all-e-same Bible. Bring out a Bible here, Uma,\r\nif you\xe2\x80\x99ve got such a thing, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll kiss it. Or, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbetter still,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, taking a header, \xe2\x80\x9cask him if he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid to go\r\nup there himself by day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt appeared he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t; he could venture as far as that by day and in\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the ticket, then!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cTell him the man\xe2\x80\x99s a fraud and the\r\nplace foolishness, and if he\xe2\x80\x99ll go up there to-morrow he\xe2\x80\x99ll see all\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s left of it. But tell him this, Uma, and mind he understands it:\r\nIf he gets talking, it\xe2\x80\x99s bound to come to Case, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a dead man! I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nplaying his game, tell him, and if he says one word my blood will be at\r\nhis door and be the damnation of him here and after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe told him, and he shook hands with me up to the hilt, and, says he:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo talk. Go up to-morrow. You my friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo sir,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, \xe2\x80\x9cno such foolishness. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come here to trade, tell\r\nhim, and not to make friends. But, as to Case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll send that man to\r\nglory!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo off Maea went, pretty well pleased, as I could see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nNIGHT IN THE BUSH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, I was committed now; Tiapolo had to be smashed up before next\r\nday, and my hands were pretty full, not only with preparations, but\r\nwith argument. My house was like a mechanics\xe2\x80\x99 debating society: Uma was\r\nso made up that I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go into the bush by night, or that, if I\r\ndid, I was never to come back again. You know her style of arguing:\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve had a specimen about Queen Victoria and the devil; and I leave\r\nyou to fancy if I was tired of it before dark.\r\n\r\nAt last I had a good idea. What was the use of casting my pearls before\r\nher? I thought; some of her own chopped hay would be likelier to do the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cYou fish out your Bible, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntake that up along with me. That\xe2\x80\x99ll make me right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe swore a Bible was no use.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just your Kanaka ignorance,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cBring the Bible out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe brought it, and I turned to the title-page, where I thought there\r\nwould likely be some English, and so there was. \xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cLook\r\nat that! \xe2\x80\x98_London_: _Printed for the British and Foreign Bible\r\nSociety_, _Blackfriars_,\xe2\x80\x99 and the date, which I can\xe2\x80\x99t read, owing to\r\nits being in these X\xe2\x80\x99s. There\xe2\x80\x99s no devil in hell can look near the\r\nBible Society, Blackfriars. Why, you silly!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you\r\nsuppose we get along with our own _aitus_ at home? All Bible Society!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you no got any,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cWhite man, he tell me you no got.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSounds likely, don\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy would these islands all be\r\nchock full of them and none in Europe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you no got breadfruit,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\nI could have torn my hair. \xe2\x80\x9cNow look here, old lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou dry\r\nup, for I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the Bible, which\xe2\x80\x99ll put me as\r\nstraight as the mail, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the last word I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe night fell extraordinary dark, clouds coming up with sundown and\r\noverspreading all; not a star showed; there was only an end of a moon,\r\nand that not due before the small hours. Round the village, what with\r\nthe lights and the fires in the open houses, and the torches of many\r\nfishers moving on the reef, it kept as gay as an illumination; but the\r\nsea and the mountains and woods were all clean gone. I suppose it might\r\nbe eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock when I took the road, laden like a donkey. First there\r\nwas that Bible, a book as big as your head, which I had let myself in\r\nfor by my own tomfoolery. Then there was my gun, and knife, and\r\nlantern, and patent matches, all necessary. And then there was the real\r\nplant of the affair in hand, a mortal weight of gunpowder, a pair of\r\ndynamite fishing-bombs, and two or three pieces of slow match that I\r\nhad hauled out of the tin cases and spliced together the best way I\r\ncould; for the match was only trade stuff, and a man would be crazy\r\nthat trusted it. Altogether, you see, I had the materials of a pretty\r\ngood blow-up! Expense was nothing to me; I wanted that thing done\r\nright.\r\n\r\nAs long as I was in the open, and had the lamp in my house to steer by,\r\nI did well. But when I got to the path, it fell so dark I could make no\r\nheadway, walking into trees and swearing there, like a man looking for\r\nthe matches in his bed-room. I knew it was risky to light up, for my\r\nlantern would be visible all the way to the point of the cape, and as\r\nno one went there after dark, it would be talked about, and come to\r\nCase\xe2\x80\x99s ears. But what was I to do? I had either to give the business\r\nover and lose caste with Maea, or light up, take my chance, and get\r\nthrough the thing the smartest I was able.\r\n\r\nAs long as I was on the path I walked hard, but when I came to the\r\nblack beach I had to run. For the tide was now nearly flowed; and to\r\nget through with my powder dry between the surf and the steep hill,\r\ntook all the quickness I possessed. As it was, even, the wash caught me\r\nto the knees, and I came near falling on a stone. All this time the\r\nhurry I was in, and the free air and smell of the sea, kept my spirits\r\nlively; but when I was once in the bush and began to climb the path I\r\ntook it easier. The fearsomeness of the wood had been a good bit rubbed\r\noff for me by Master Case\xe2\x80\x99s banjo-strings and graven images, yet I\r\nthought it was a dreary walk, and guessed, when the disciples went up\r\nthere, they must be badly scared. The light of the lantern, striking\r\namong all these trunks and forked branches and twisted rope-ends of\r\nlianas, made the whole place, or all that you could see of it, a kind\r\nof a puzzle of turning shadows. They came to meet you, solid and quick\r\nlike giants, and then span off and vanished; they hove up over your\r\nhead like clubs, and flew away into the night like birds. The floor of\r\nthe bush glimmered with dead wood, the way the match-box used to shine\r\nafter you had struck a lucifer. Big, cold drops fell on me from the\r\nbranches overhead like sweat. There was no wind to mention; only a\r\nlittle icy breath of a land-breeze that stirred nothing; and the harps\r\nwere silent.\r\n\r\nThe first landfall I made was when I got through the bush of wild\r\ncocoanuts, and came in view of the bogies on the wall. Mighty queer\r\nthey looked by the shining of the lantern, with their painted faces and\r\nshell eyes, and their clothes and their hair hanging. One after another\r\nI pulled them all up and piled them in a bundle on the cellar roof, so\r\nas they might go to glory with the rest. Then I chose a place behind\r\none of the big stones at the entrance, buried my powder and the two\r\nshells, and arranged my match along the passage. And then I had a look\r\nat the smoking head, just for good-bye. It was doing fine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheer up,\xe2\x80\x9d says I. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re booked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was my first idea to light up and be getting homeward; for the\r\ndarkness and the glimmer of the dead wood and the shadows of the\r\nlantern made me lonely. But I knew where one of the harps hung; it\r\nseemed a pity it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go with the rest; and at the same time I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help letting on to myself that I was mortal tired of my\r\nemployment, and would like best to be at home and have the door shut. I\r\nstepped out of the cellar and argued it fore and back. There was a\r\nsound of the sea far down below me on the coast; nearer hand not a leaf\r\nstirred; I might have been the only living creature this side of Cape\r\nHorn. Well, as I stood there thinking, it seemed the bush woke and\r\nbecame full of little noises. Little noises they were, and nothing to\r\nhurt\xe2\x80\x94a bit of a crackle, a bit of a rush\xe2\x80\x94but the breath jumped right\r\nout of me and my throat went as dry as a biscuit. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Case I was\r\nafraid of, which would have been common-sense; I never thought of Case;\r\nwhat took me, as sharp as the colic, was the old wives\xe2\x80\x99 tales, the\r\ndevil-women and the man-pigs. It was the toss of a penny whether I\r\nshould run: but I got a purchase on myself, and stepped out, and held\r\nup the lantern (like a fool) and looked all round.\r\n\r\nIn the direction of the village and the path there was nothing to be\r\nseen; but when I turned inland it\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder to me I didn\xe2\x80\x99t drop.\r\nThere, coming right up out of the desert and the bad bush\xe2\x80\x94there, sure\r\nenough, was a devil-woman, just as the way I had figured she would\r\nlook. I saw the light shine on her bare arms and her bright eyes, and\r\nthere went out of me a yell so big that I thought it was my death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! No sing out!\xe2\x80\x9d says the devil-woman, in a kind of a high whisper.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy you talk big voice? Put out light! Ese he come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy God Almighty, Uma, is that you?\xe2\x80\x9d says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ioe_,\xe2\x80\x9d [4] says she. \xe2\x80\x9cI come quick. Ese here soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou come alone?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou no \xe2\x80\x99fraid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, too much \xe2\x80\x99fraid!\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered, clutching me. \xe2\x80\x9cI think die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d says I, with a kind of a weak grin, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not the one to laugh\r\nat you, Mrs. Wiltshire, for I\xe2\x80\x99m about the worst scared man in the South\r\nPacific myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe told me in two words what brought her. I was scarce gone, it seems,\r\nwhen Fa\xe2\x80\x99avao came in, and the old woman had met Black Jack running as\r\nhard as he was fit from our house to Case\xe2\x80\x99s. Uma neither spoke nor\r\nstopped, but lit right out to come and warn me. She was so close at my\r\nheels that the lantern was her guide across the beach, and afterwards,\r\nby the glimmer of it in the trees, she got her line up hill. It was\r\nonly when I had got to the top or was in the cellar that she wandered\r\nLord knows where! and lost a sight of precious time, afraid to call out\r\nlest Case was at the heels of her, and falling in the bush, so that she\r\nwas all knocked and bruised. That must have been when she got too far\r\nto the southward, and how she came to take me in the flank at last and\r\nfrighten me beyond what I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the words to tell of.\r\n\r\nWell, anything was better than a devil-woman, but I thought her yarn\r\nserious enough. Black Jack had no call to be about my house, unless he\r\nwas set there to watch; and it looked to me as if my tomfool word about\r\nthe paint, and perhaps some chatter of Maea\xe2\x80\x99s, had got us all in a\r\nclove hitch. One thing was clear: Uma and I were here for the night; we\r\ndaren\xe2\x80\x99t try to go home before day, and even then it would be safer to\r\nstrike round up the mountain and come in by the back of the village, or\r\nwe might walk into an ambuscade. It was plain, too, that the mine\r\nshould be sprung immediately, or Case might be in time to stop it.\r\n\r\nI marched into the tunnel, Uma keeping tight hold of me, opened my\r\nlantern and lit the match. The first length of it burned like a spill\r\nof paper, and I stood stupid, watching it burn, and thinking we were\r\ngoing aloft with Tiapolo, which was none of my views. The second took\r\nto a better rate, though faster than I cared about; and at that I got\r\nmy wits again, hauled Uma clear of the passage, blew out and dropped\r\nthe lantern, and the pair of us groped our way into the bush until I\r\nthought it might be safe, and lay down together by a tree.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld lady,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t forget this night. You\xe2\x80\x99re a trump, and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe humped herself close up to me. She had run out the way she was,\r\nwith nothing on her but her kilt; and she was all wet with the dews and\r\nthe sea on the black beach, and shook straight on with cold and the\r\nterror of the dark and the devils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo much \xe2\x80\x99fraid,\xe2\x80\x9d was all she said.\r\n\r\nThe far side of Case\xe2\x80\x99s hill goes down near as steep as a precipice into\r\nthe next valley. We were on the very edge of it, and I could see the\r\ndead wood shine and hear the sea sound far below. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care about\r\nthe position, which left me no retreat, but I was afraid to change.\r\nThen I saw I had made a worse mistake about the lantern, which I should\r\nhave left lighted, so that I could have had a crack at Case when he\r\nstepped into the shine of it. And even if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had the wit to do\r\nthat, it seemed a senseless thing to leave the good lantern to blow up\r\nwith the graven images. The thing belonged to me, after all, and was\r\nworth money, and might come in handy. If I could have trusted the\r\nmatch, I might have run in still and rescued it. But who was going to\r\ntrust the match? You know what trade is. The stuff was good enough for\r\nKanakas to go fishing with, where they\xe2\x80\x99ve got to look lively anyway,\r\nand the most they risk is only to have their hand blown off. But for\r\nanyone that wanted to fool around a blow-up like mine that match was\r\nrubbish.\r\n\r\nAltogether the best I could do was to lie still, see my shot-gun handy,\r\nand wait for the explosion. But it was a solemn kind of a business. The\r\nblackness of the night was like solid; the only thing you could see was\r\nthe nasty bogy glimmer of the dead wood, and that showed you nothing\r\nbut itself; and as for sounds, I stretched my ears till I thought I\r\ncould have heard the match burn in the tunnel, and that bush was as\r\nsilent as a coffin. Now and then there was a bit of a crack; but\r\nwhether it was near or far, whether it was Case stubbing his toes\r\nwithin a few yards of me, or a tree breaking miles away, I knew no more\r\nthan the babe unborn.\r\n\r\nAnd then, all of a sudden, Vesuvius went off. It was a long time\r\ncoming; but when it came (though I say it that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t) no man could\r\nask to see a better. At first it was just a son of a gun of a row, and\r\na spout of fire, and the wood lighted up so that you could see to read.\r\nAnd then the trouble began. Uma and I were half buried under a wagonful\r\nof earth, and glad it was no worse, for one of the rocks at the\r\nentrance of the tunnel was fired clean into the air, fell within a\r\ncouple of fathoms of where we lay, and bounded over the edge of the\r\nhill, and went pounding down into the next valley. I saw I had rather\r\nundercalculated our distance, or over-done the dynamite and powder,\r\nwhich you please.\r\n\r\nAnd presently I saw I had made another slip. The noise of the thing\r\nbegan to die off, shaking the island; the dazzle was over; and yet the\r\nnight didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back the way I expected. For the whole wood was\r\nscattered with red coals and brands from the explosion; they were all\r\nround me on the flat; some had fallen below in the valley, and some\r\nstuck and flared in the tree-tops. I had no fear of fire, for these\r\nforests are too wet to kindle. But the trouble was that the place was\r\nall lit up-not very bright, but good enough to get a shot by; and the\r\nway the coals were scattered, it was just as likely Case might have the\r\nadvantage as myself. I looked all round for his white face, you may be\r\nsure; but there was not a sign of him. As for Uma, the life seemed to\r\nhave been knocked right out of her by the bang and blaze of it.\r\n\r\nThere was one bad point in my game. One of the blessed graven images\r\nhad come down all afire, hair and clothes and body, not four yards away\r\nfrom me. I cast a mighty noticing glance all round; there was still no\r\nCase, and I made up my mind I must get rid of that burning stick before\r\nhe came, or I should be shot there like a dog.\r\n\r\nIt was my first idea to have crawled, and then I thought speed was the\r\nmain thing, and stood half up to make a rush. The same moment from\r\nsomewhere between me and the sea there came a flash and a report, and a\r\nrifle bullet screeched in my ear. I swung straight round and up with my\r\ngun, but the brute had a Winchester, and before I could as much as see\r\nhim his second shot knocked me over like a nine-pin. I seemed to fly in\r\nthe air, then came down by the run and lay half a minute, silly; and\r\nthen I found my hands empty, and my gun had flown over my head as I\r\nfell. It makes a man mighty wide awake to be in the kind of box that I\r\nwas in. I scarcely knew where I was hurt, or whether I was hurt or not,\r\nbut turned right over on my face to crawl after my weapon. Unless you\r\nhave tried to get about with a smashed leg you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what pain is,\r\nand I let out a howl like a bullock\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThis was the unluckiest noise that ever I made in my life. Up to then\r\nUma had stuck to her tree like a sensible woman, knowing she would be\r\nonly in the way; but as soon as she heard me sing out, she ran forward.\r\nThe Winchester cracked again, and down she went.\r\n\r\nI had sat up, leg and all, to stop her; but when I saw her tumble I\r\nclapped down again where I was, lay still, and felt the handle of my\r\nknife. I had been scurried and put out before. No more of that for me.\r\nHe had knocked over my girl, I had got to fix him for it; and I lay\r\nthere and gritted my teeth, and footed up the chances. My leg was\r\nbroke, my gun was gone. Case had still ten shots in his Winchester. It\r\nlooked a kind of hopeless business. But I never despaired nor thought\r\nupon despairing: that man had got to go.\r\n\r\nFor a goodish bit not one of us let on. Then I heard Case begin to move\r\nnearer in the bush, but mighty careful. The image had burned out; there\r\nwere only a few coals left here and there, and the wood was main dark,\r\nbut had a kind of a low glow in it like a fire on its last legs. It was\r\nby this that I made out Case\xe2\x80\x99s head looking at me over a big tuft of\r\nferns, and at the same time the brute saw me and shouldered his\r\nWinchester. I lay quite still, and as good as looked into the barrel:\r\nit was my last chance, but I thought my heart would have come right out\r\nof its bearings. Then he fired. Lucky for me it was no shot-gun, for\r\nthe bullet struck within an inch of me and knocked the dirt in my eyes.\r\n\r\nJust you try and see if you can lie quiet, and let a man take a sitting\r\nshot at you and miss you by a hair. But I did, and lucky too. A while\r\nCase stood with the Winchester at the port-arms; then he gave a little\r\nlaugh to himself, and stepped round the ferns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaugh!\xe2\x80\x9d thought I. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you had the wit of a louse you would be\r\npraying!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was all as taut as a ship\xe2\x80\x99s hawser or the spring of a watch, and as\r\nsoon as he came within reach of me I had him by the ankle, plucked the\r\nfeet right out from under him, laid him out, and was upon the top of\r\nhim, broken leg and all, before he breathed. His Winchester had gone\r\nthe same road as my shot-gun; it was nothing to me\xe2\x80\x94I defied him now.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a pretty strong man anyway, but I never knew what strength was till\r\nI got hold of Case. He was knocked out of time by the rattle he came\r\ndown with, and threw up his hands together, more like a frightened\r\nwoman, so that I caught both of them with my left. This wakened him up,\r\nand he fastened his teeth in my forearm like a weasel. Much I cared. My\r\nleg gave me all the pain I had any use for, and I drew my knife and got\r\nit in the place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got you; and you\xe2\x80\x99re gone up, and a good job too!\r\nDo you feel the point of that? That\xe2\x80\x99s for Underhill! And there\xe2\x80\x99s for\r\nAdams! And now here\xe2\x80\x99s for Uma, and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to knock your blooming\r\nsoul right out of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that I gave him the cold steel for all I was worth. His body\r\nkicked under me like a spring sofa; he gave a dreadful kind of a long\r\nmoan, and lay still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if you\xe2\x80\x99re dead? I hope so!\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, for my head was\r\nswimming. But I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to take chances; I had his own example too\r\nclose before me for that; and I tried to draw the knife out to give it\r\nhim again. The blood came over my hands, I remember, hot as tea; and\r\nwith that I fainted clean away, and fell with my head on the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to myself it was pitch dark; the cinders had burned out;\r\nthere was nothing to be seen but the shine of the dead wood, and I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember where I was nor why I was in such pain nor what I was\r\nall wetted with. Then it came back, and the first thing I attended to\r\nwas to give him the knife again a half-a-dozen times up to the handle.\r\nI believe he was dead already, but it did him no harm and did me good.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bet you\xe2\x80\x99re dead now,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, and then I called to Uma.\r\n\r\nNothing answered, and I made a move to go and grope for her, fouled my\r\nbroken leg, and fainted again.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to myself the second time the clouds had all cleared away,\r\nexcept a few that sailed there, white as cotton. The moon was up\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ntropic moon. The moon at home turns a wood black, but even this old\r\nbutt-end of a one showed up that forest, as green as by day. The night\r\nbirds\xe2\x80\x94or, rather, they\xe2\x80\x99re a kind of early morning bird\xe2\x80\x94sang out with\r\ntheir long, falling notes like nightingales. And I could see the dead\r\nman, that I was still half resting on, looking right up into the sky\r\nwith his open eyes, no paler than when he was alive; and a little way\r\noff Uma tumbled on her side. I got over to her the best way I was able,\r\nand when I got there she was broad awake, and crying and sobbing to\r\nherself with no more noise than an insect. It appears she was afraid to\r\ncry out loud, because of the _aitus_. Altogether she was not much hurt,\r\nbut scared beyond belief; she had come to her senses a long while ago,\r\ncried out to me, heard nothing in reply, made out we were both dead,\r\nand had lain there ever since, afraid to budge a finger. The ball had\r\nploughed up her shoulder, and she had lost a main quantity of blood;\r\nbut I soon had that tied up the way it ought to be with the tail of my\r\nshirt and a scarf I had on, got her head on my sound knee and my back\r\nagainst a trunk, and settled down to wait for morning. Uma was for\r\nneither use nor ornament, and could only clutch hold of me and shake\r\nand cry. I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose there was ever anybody worse scared, and, to\r\ndo her justice, she had had a lively night of it. As for me, I was in a\r\ngood bit of pain and fever, but not so bad when I sat still; and every\r\ntime I looked over to Case I could have sung and whistled. Talk about\r\nmeat and drink! To see that man lying there dead as a herring filled me\r\nfull.\r\n\r\nThe night birds stopped after a while; and then the light began to\r\nchange, the east came orange, the whole wood began to whirr with\r\nsinging like a musical box, and there was the broad day.\r\n\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect Maea for a long while yet; and, indeed, I thought there\r\nwas an off-chance he might go back on the whole idea and not come at\r\nall. I was the better pleased when, about an hour after daylight, I\r\nheard sticks smashing and a lot of Kanakas laughing, and singing out to\r\nkeep their courage up. Uma sat up quite brisk at the first word of it;\r\nand presently we saw a party come stringing out of the path, Maea in\r\nfront, and behind him a white man in a pith helmet. It was Mr.\r\nTarleton, who had turned up late last night in Fales\xc3\xa1, having left his\r\nboat and walked the last stage with a lantern.\r\n\r\nThey buried Case upon the field of glory, right in the hole where he\r\nhad kept the smoking head. I waited till the thing was done; and Mr.\r\nTarleton prayed, which I thought tomfoolery, but I\xe2\x80\x99m bound to say he\r\ngave a pretty sick view of the dear departed\xe2\x80\x99s prospects, and seemed to\r\nhave his own ideas of hell. I had it out with him afterwards, told him\r\nhe had scamped his duty, and what he had ought to have done was to up\r\nlike a man and tell the Kanakas plainly Case was damned, and a good\r\nriddance; but I never could get him to see it my way. Then they made me\r\na litter of poles and carried me down to the station. Mr. Tarleton set\r\nmy leg, and made a regular missionary splice of it, so that I limp to\r\nthis day. That done, he took down my evidence, and Uma\xe2\x80\x99s, and Maea\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nwrote it all out fine, and had us sign it; and then he got the chiefs\r\nand marched over to Papa Randall\xe2\x80\x99s to seize Case\xe2\x80\x99s papers.\r\n\r\nAll they found was a bit of a diary, kept for a good many years, and\r\nall about the price of copra, and chickens being stolen, and that; and\r\nthe books of the business and the will I told you of in the beginning,\r\nby both of which the whole thing (stock, lock, and barrel) appeared to\r\nbelong to the Samoa woman. It was I that bought her out at a mighty\r\nreasonable figure, for she was in a hurry to get home. As for Randall\r\nand the black, they had to tramp; got into some kind of a station on\r\nthe Papa-malulu side; did very bad business, for the truth is neither\r\nof the pair was fit for it, and lived mostly on fish, which was the\r\nmeans of Randall\xe2\x80\x99s death. It seems there was a nice shoal in one day,\r\nand papa went after them with the dynamite; either the match burned too\r\nfast, or papa was full, or both, but the shell went off (in the usual\r\nway) before he threw it, and where was papa\xe2\x80\x99s hand? Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing to hurt in that; the islands up north are all full of\r\none-handed men, like the parties in the \xe2\x80\x9cArabian Nights\xe2\x80\x9d; but either\r\nRandall was too old, or he drank too much, and the short and the long\r\nof it was that he died. Pretty soon after, the nigger was turned out of\r\nthe island for stealing from white men, and went off to the west, where\r\nhe found men of his own colour, in case he liked that, and the men of\r\nhis own colour took and ate him at some kind of a corroborree, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsure I hope he was to their fancy!\r\n\r\nSo there was I, left alone in my glory at Fales\xc3\xa1; and when the schooner\r\ncame round I filled her up, and gave her a deck-cargo half as high as\r\nthe house. I must say Mr. Tarleton did the right thing by us; but he\r\ntook a meanish kind of a revenge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mr. Wiltshire,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve put you all square with everybody\r\nhere. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t difficult to do, Case being gone; but I have done it,\r\nand given my pledge besides that you will deal fairly with the natives.\r\nI must ask you to keep my word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, so I did. I used to be bothered about my balances, but I reasoned\r\nit out this way: We all have queerish balances; and the natives all\r\nknow it, and water their copra in a proportion so that it\xe2\x80\x99s fair all\r\nround; but the truth is, it did use to bother me, and, though I did\r\nwell in Fales\xc3\xa1, I was half glad when the firm moved me on to another\r\nstation, where I was under no kind of a pledge and could look my\r\nbalances in the face.\r\n\r\nAs for the old lady, you know her as well as I do. She\xe2\x80\x99s only the one\r\nfault. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t keep your eye lifting she would give away the roof\r\noff the station. Well, it seems it\xe2\x80\x99s natural in Kanakas. She\xe2\x80\x99s turned a\r\npowerful big woman now, and could throw a London bobby over her\r\nshoulder. But that\xe2\x80\x99s natural in Kanakas too, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no manner of\r\ndoubt that she\xe2\x80\x99s an A 1 wife.\r\n\r\nMr. Tarleton\xe2\x80\x99s gone home, his trick being over. He was the best\r\nmissionary I ever struck, and now, it seems, he\xe2\x80\x99s parsonising down\r\nSomerset way. Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s best for him; he\xe2\x80\x99ll have no Kanakas there to\r\nget luny over.\r\n\r\nMy public-house? Not a bit of it, nor ever likely. I\xe2\x80\x99m stuck here, I\r\nfancy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to leave the kids, you see: and\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no use\r\ntalking\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re better here than what they would be in a white man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncountry, though Ben took the eldest up to Auckland, where he\xe2\x80\x99s being\r\nschooled with the best. But what bothers me is the girls. They\xe2\x80\x99re only\r\nhalf-castes, of course; I know that as well as you do, and there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnobody thinks less of half-castes than I do; but they\xe2\x80\x99re mine, and\r\nabout all I\xe2\x80\x99ve got. I can\xe2\x80\x99t reconcile my mind to their taking up with\r\nKanakas, and I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know where I\xe2\x80\x99m to find the whites?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOTTLE IMP.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote.\xe2\x80\x94Any student of that very unliterary product, the English drama of\r\nthe early part of the century, will here recognise the name and the\r\nroot idea of a piece once rendered popular by the redoubtable O. Smith.\r\nThe root idea is there and identical, and yet I hope I have made it a\r\nnew thing. And the fact that the tale has been designed and written for\r\na Polynesian audience may lend it some extraneous interest nearer\r\nhome.\xe2\x80\x94R. L. S.\r\n\r\nThere was a man of the Island of Hawaii, whom I shall call Keawe; for\r\nthe truth is, he still lives, and his name must be kept secret; but the\r\nplace of his birth was not far from Honaunau, where the bones of Keawe\r\nthe Great lie hidden in a cave. This man was poor, brave, and active;\r\nhe could read and write like a schoolmaster; he was a first-rate\r\nmariner besides, sailed for some time in the island steamers, and\r\nsteered a whaleboat on the Hamakua coast. At length it came in Keawe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmind to have a sight of the great world and foreign cities, and he\r\nshipped on a vessel bound to San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThis is a fine town, with a fine harbour, and rich people uncountable;\r\nand, in particular, there is one hill which is covered with palaces.\r\nUpon this hill Keawe was one day taking a walk with his pocket full of\r\nmoney, viewing the great houses upon either hand with pleasure, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nfine houses these are!\xe2\x80\x9d he was thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cand how happy must those\r\npeople be who dwell in them, and take no care for the morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nthought was in his mind when he came abreast of a house that was\r\nsmaller than some others, but all finished and beautified like a toy;\r\nthe steps of that house shone like silver, and the borders of the\r\ngarden bloomed like garlands, and the windows were bright like diamond;\r\nand Keawe stopped and wondered at the excellence of all he saw. So\r\nstopping, he was aware of a man that looked forth upon him through a\r\nwindow so clear that Keawe could see him as you see a fish in a pool\r\nupon the reef. The man was elderly, with a bald head and a black beard;\r\nand his face was heavy with sorrow, and he bitterly sighed. And the\r\ntruth of it is, that as Keawe looked in upon the man, and the man\r\nlooked out upon Keawe, each envied the other.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, the man smiled and nodded, and beckoned Keawe to\r\nenter, and met him at the door of the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a fine house of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, and bitterly sighed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you not care to view the chambers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he led Keawe all over it, from the cellar to the roof, and there was\r\nnothing there that was not perfect of its kind, and Keawe was\r\nastonished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a beautiful house; if I lived in the like\r\nof it, I should be laughing all day long. How comes it, then, that you\r\nshould be sighing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no reason,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy you should not have a house in\r\nall points similar to this, and finer, if you wish. You have some\r\nmoney, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have fifty dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe; \xe2\x80\x9cbut a house like this will cost\r\nmore than fifty dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man made a computation. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry you have no more,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor it may raise you trouble in the future; but it shall be yours at\r\nfifty dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe house?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Keawe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not the house,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the bottle. For, I must tell\r\nyou, although I appear to you so rich and fortunate, all my fortune,\r\nand this house itself and its garden, came out of a bottle not much\r\nbigger than a pint. This is it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he opened a lockfast place, and took out a round-bellied bottle\r\nwith a long neck; the glass of it was white like milk, with changing\r\nrainbow colours in the grain. Withinsides something obscurely moved,\r\nlike a shadow and a fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the bottle,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man; and, when Keawe laughed, \xe2\x80\x9cYou do\r\nnot believe me?\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cTry, then, for yourself. See if you can\r\nbreak it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Keawe took the bottle up and dashed it on the floor till he was\r\nweary; but it jumped on the floor like a child\xe2\x80\x99s ball, and was not\r\ninjured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a strange thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe. \xe2\x80\x9cFor by the touch of it, as well\r\nas by the look, the bottle should be of glass.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf glass it is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man, sighing more heavily than ever; \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nthe glass of it was tempered in the flames of hell. An imp lives in it,\r\nand that is the shadow we behold there moving: or so I suppose. If any\r\nman buy this bottle the imp is at his command; all that he\r\ndesires\xe2\x80\x94love, fame, money, houses like this house, ay, or a city like\r\nthis city\xe2\x80\x94all are his at the word uttered. Napoleon had this bottle,\r\nand by it he grew to be the king of the world; but he sold it at the\r\nlast, and fell. Captain Cook had this bottle, and by it he found his\r\nway to so many islands; but he, too, sold it, and was slain upon\r\nHawaii. For, once it is sold, the power goes and the protection; and\r\nunless a man remain content with what he has, ill will befall him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet you talk of selling it yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d Keawe said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have all I wish, and I am growing elderly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nis one thing the imp cannot do\xe2\x80\x94he cannot prolong life; and, it would\r\nnot be fair to conceal from you, there is a drawback to the bottle; for\r\nif a man die before he sells it, he must burn in hell forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, that is a drawback and no mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Keawe. \xe2\x80\x9cI would\r\nnot meddle with the thing. I can do without a house, thank God; but\r\nthere is one thing I could not be doing with one particle, and that is\r\nto be damned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, you must not run away with things,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the man. \xe2\x80\x9cAll\r\nyou have to do is to use the power of the imp in moderation, and then\r\nsell it to someone else, as I do to you, and finish your life in\r\ncomfort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I observe two things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the time you keep\r\nsighing like a maid in love, that is one; and, for the other, you sell\r\nthis bottle very cheap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told you already why I sigh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is because I\r\nfear my health is breaking up; and, as you said yourself, to die and go\r\nto the devil is a pity for anyone. As for why I sell so cheap, I must\r\nexplain to you there is a peculiarity about the bottle. Long ago, when\r\nthe devil brought it first upon earth, it was extremely expensive, and\r\nwas sold first of all to Prester John for many millions of dollars; but\r\nit cannot be sold at all, unless sold at a loss. If you sell it for as\r\nmuch as you paid for it, back it comes to you again like a homing\r\npigeon. It follows that the price has kept falling in these centuries,\r\nand the bottle is now remarkably cheap. I bought it myself from one of\r\nmy great neighbours on this hill, and the price I paid was only ninety\r\ndollars. I could sell it for as high as eighty-nine dollars and\r\nninety-nine cents, but not a penny dearer, or back the thing must come\r\nto me. Now, about this there are two bothers. First, when you offer a\r\nbottle so singular for eighty odd dollars, people suppose you to be\r\njesting. And second\xe2\x80\x94but there is no hurry about that\xe2\x80\x94and I need not go\r\ninto it. Only remember it must be coined money that you sell it for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow am I to know that this is all true?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Keawe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of it you can try at once,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me your fifty\r\ndollars, take the bottle, and wish your fifty dollars back into your\r\npocket. If that does not happen, I pledge you my honour I will cry off\r\nthe bargain and restore your money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not deceiving me?\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe.\r\n\r\nThe man bound himself with a great oath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I will risk that much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9cfor that can do no harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd he paid over his money to the man, and the man handed him the\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImp of the bottle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9cI want my fifty dollars back.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nsure enough he had scarce said the word before his pocket was as heavy\r\nas ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure this is a wonderful bottle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now good-morning to you, my fine fellow, and the devil go with you\r\nfor me!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want any more of this fun. Here, take\r\nyour bottle back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have bought it for less than I paid for it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man,\r\nrubbing his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is yours now; and, for my part, I am only\r\nconcerned to see the back of you.\xe2\x80\x9d And with that he rang for his\r\nChinese servant, and had Keawe shown out of the house.\r\n\r\nNow, when Keawe was in the street, with the bottle under his arm, he\r\nbegan to think. \xe2\x80\x9cIf all is true about this bottle, I may have made a\r\nlosing bargain,\xe2\x80\x9d thinks he. \xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps the man was only fooling me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe first thing he did was to count his money; the sum was\r\nexact\xe2\x80\x94forty-nine dollars American money, and one Chili piece. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nlooks like the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I will try another part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe streets in that part of the city were as clean as a ship\xe2\x80\x99s decks,\r\nand though it was noon, there were no passengers. Keawe set the bottle\r\nin the gutter and walked away. Twice he looked back, and there was the\r\nmilky, round-bellied bottle where he left it. A third time he looked\r\nback, and turned a corner; but he had scarce done so, when something\r\nknocked upon his elbow, and behold! it was the long neck sticking up;\r\nand as for the round belly, it was jammed into the pocket of his\r\npilot-coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that looks like the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe.\r\n\r\nThe next thing he did was to buy a cork-screw in a shop, and go apart\r\ninto a secret place in the fields. And there he tried to draw the cork,\r\nbut as often as he put the screw in, out it came again, and the cork as\r\nwhole as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is some new sort of cork,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe, and all at once he began\r\nto shake and sweat, for he was afraid of that bottle.\r\n\r\nOn his way back to the port-side, he saw a shop where a man sold shells\r\nand clubs from the wild islands, old heathen deities, old coined money,\r\npictures from China and Japan, and all manner of things that sailors\r\nbring in their sea-chests. And here he had an idea. So he went in and\r\noffered the bottle for a hundred dollars. The man of the shop laughed\r\nat him at the first, and offered him five; but, indeed, it was a\r\ncurious bottle\xe2\x80\x94such glass was never blown in any human glassworks, so\r\nprettily the colours shone under the milky white, and so strangely the\r\nshadow hovered in the midst; so, after he had disputed awhile after the\r\nmanner of his kind, the shop-man gave Keawe sixty silver dollars for\r\nthe thing, and set it on a shelf in the midst of his window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9cI have sold that for sixty which I bought for\r\nfifty\xe2\x80\x94or, to say truth, a little less, because one of my dollars was\r\nfrom Chili. Now I shall know the truth upon another point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he went back on board his ship, and, when he opened his chest, there\r\nwas the bottle, and had come more quickly than himself. Now Keawe had a\r\nmate on board whose name was Lopaka.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat ails you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lopaka, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you stare in your chest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were alone in the ship\xe2\x80\x99s forecastle, and Keawe bound him to\r\nsecrecy, and told all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a very strange affair,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lopaka; \xe2\x80\x9cand I fear you will be\r\nin trouble about this bottle. But there is one point very clear\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nyou are sure of the trouble, and you had better have the profit in the\r\nbargain. Make up your mind what you want with it; give the order, and\r\nif it is done as you desire, I will buy the bottle myself; for I have\r\nan idea of my own to get a schooner, and go trading through the\r\nislands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not my idea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe; \xe2\x80\x9cbut to have a beautiful house and\r\ngarden on the Kona Coast, where I was born, the sun shining in at the\r\ndoor, flowers in the garden, glass in the windows, pictures on the\r\nwalls, and toys and fine carpets on the tables, for all the world like\r\nthe house I was in this day\xe2\x80\x94only a storey higher, and with balconies\r\nall about like the King\xe2\x80\x99s palace; and to live there without care and\r\nmake merry with my friends and relatives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lopaka, \xe2\x80\x9clet us carry it back with us to Hawaii; and if\r\nall comes true, as you suppose, I will buy the bottle, as I said, and\r\nask a schooner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon that they were agreed, and it was not long before the ship\r\nreturned to Honolulu, carrying Keawe and Lopaka, and the bottle. They\r\nwere scarce come ashore when they met a friend upon the beach, who\r\nbegan at once to condole with Keawe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know what I am to be condoled about,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible you have not heard,\xe2\x80\x9d said the friend, \xe2\x80\x9cyour uncle\xe2\x80\x94that\r\ngood old man\xe2\x80\x94is dead, and your cousin\xe2\x80\x94that beautiful boy\xe2\x80\x94was drowned at\r\nsea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKeawe was filled with sorrow, and, beginning to weep and to lament, he\r\nforgot about the bottle. But Lopaka was thinking to himself, and\r\npresently, when Keawe\xe2\x80\x99s grief was a little abated, \xe2\x80\x9cI have been\r\nthinking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lopaka. \xe2\x80\x9cHad not your uncle lands in Hawaii, in the\r\ndistrict of Kau?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9cnot in Kau; they are on the mountain-side\xe2\x80\x94a little\r\nway south of Hookena.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese lands will now be yours?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lopaka.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so they will,\xe2\x80\x9d says Keawe, and began again to lament for his\r\nrelatives.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lopaka, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not lament at present. I have a thought in my\r\nmind. How if this should be the doing of the bottle? For here is the\r\nplace ready for your house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf this be so,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a very ill way to serve me by\r\nkilling my relatives. But it may be, indeed; for it was in just such a\r\nstation that I saw the house with my mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe house, however, is not yet built,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lopaka.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, nor like to be!\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe; \xe2\x80\x9cfor though my uncle has some coffee\r\nand ava and bananas, it will not be more than will keep me in comfort;\r\nand the rest of that land is the black lava.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to the lawyer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lopaka; \xe2\x80\x9cI have still this idea in my\r\nmind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow, when they came to the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s, it appeared Keawe\xe2\x80\x99s uncle had\r\ngrown monstrous rich in the last days, and there was a fund of money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here is the money for the house!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lopaka.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are thinking of a new house,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer, \xe2\x80\x9chere is the\r\ncard of a new architect, of whom they tell me great things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter and better!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Lopaka. \xe2\x80\x9cHere is all made plain for us. Let\r\nus continue to obey orders.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they went to the architect, and he had drawings of houses on his\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want something out of the way,\xe2\x80\x9d said the architect. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you\r\nlike this?\xe2\x80\x9d and he handed a drawing to Keawe.\r\n\r\nNow, when Keawe set eyes on the drawing, he cried out aloud, for it was\r\nthe picture of his thought exactly drawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in for this house,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cLittle as I like the way it\r\ncomes to me, I am in for it now, and I may as well take the good along\r\nwith the evil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he told the architect all that he wished, and how he would have that\r\nhouse furnished, and about the pictures on the wall and the\r\nknick-knacks on the tables; and he asked the man plainly for how much\r\nhe would undertake the whole affair.\r\n\r\nThe architect put many questions, and took his pen and made a\r\ncomputation; and when he had done he named the very sum that Keawe had\r\ninherited.\r\n\r\nLopaka and Keawe looked at one another and nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite clear,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I am to have this house,\r\nwhether or no. It comes from the devil, and I fear I will get little\r\ngood by that; and of one thing I am sure, I will make no more wishes as\r\nlong as I have this bottle. But with the house I am saddled, and I may\r\nas well take the good along with the evil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he made his terms with the architect, and they signed a paper; and\r\nKeawe and Lopaka took ship again and sailed to Australia; for it was\r\nconcluded between them they should not interfere at all, but leave the\r\narchitect and the bottle imp to build and to adorn that house at their\r\nown pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe voyage was a good voyage, only all the time Keawe was holding in\r\nhis breath, for he had sworn he would utter no more wishes, and take no\r\nmore favours from the devil. The time was up when they got back. The\r\narchitect told them that the house was ready, and Keawe and Lopaka took\r\na passage in the _Hall_, and went down Kona way to view the house, and\r\nsee if all had been done fitly according to the thought that was in\r\nKeawe\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\r\n\r\nNow the house stood on the mountain side, visible to ships. Above, the\r\nforest ran up into the clouds of rain; below, the black lava fell in\r\ncliffs, where the kings of old lay buried. A garden bloomed about that\r\nhouse with every hue of flowers; and there was an orchard of papaia on\r\nthe one hand and an orchard of breadfruit on the other, and right in\r\nfront, toward the sea, a ship\xe2\x80\x99s mast had been rigged up and bore a\r\nflag. As for the house, it was three storeys high, with great chambers\r\nand broad balconies on each. The windows were of glass, so excellent\r\nthat it was as clear as water and as bright as day. All manner of\r\nfurniture adorned the chambers. Pictures hung upon the wall in golden\r\nframes: pictures of ships, and men fighting, and of the most beautiful\r\nwomen, and of singular places; nowhere in the world are there pictures\r\nof so bright a colour as those Keawe found hanging in his house. As for\r\nthe knick-knacks, they were extraordinary fine; chiming clocks and\r\nmusical boxes, little men with nodding heads, books filled with\r\npictures, weapons of price from all quarters of the world, and the most\r\nelegant puzzles to entertain the leisure of a solitary man. And as no\r\none would care to live in such chambers, only to walk through and view\r\nthem, the balconies were made so broad that a whole town might have\r\nlived upon them in delight; and Keawe knew not which to prefer, whether\r\nthe back porch, where you got the land breeze, and looked upon the\r\norchards and the flowers, or the front balcony, where you could drink\r\nthe wind of the sea, and look down the steep wall of the mountain and\r\nsee the _Hall_ going by once a week or so between Hookena and the hills\r\nof Pele, or the schooners plying up the coast for wood and ava and\r\nbananas.\r\n\r\nWhen they had viewed all, Keawe and Lopaka sat on the porch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lopaka, \xe2\x80\x9cis it all as you designed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWords cannot utter it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is better than I dreamed, and\r\nI am sick with satisfaction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is but one thing to consider,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lopaka; \xe2\x80\x9call this may be\r\nquite natural, and the bottle imp have nothing whatever to say to it.\r\nIf I were to buy the bottle, and got no schooner after all, I should\r\nhave put my hand in the fire for nothing. I gave you my word, I know;\r\nbut yet I think you would not grudge me one more proof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have sworn I would take no more favours,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe. \xe2\x80\x9cI have gone\r\nalready deep enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is no favour I am thinking of,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Lopaka. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is only to\r\nsee the imp himself. There is nothing to be gained by that, and so\r\nnothing to be ashamed of; and yet, if I once saw him, I should be sure\r\nof the whole matter. So indulge me so far, and let me see the imp; and,\r\nafter that, here is the money in my hand, and I will buy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is only one thing I am afraid of,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe. \xe2\x80\x9cThe imp may be\r\nvery ugly to view; and if you once set eyes upon him you might be very\r\nundesirous of the bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a man of my word,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lopaka. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd here is the money betwixt\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Keawe. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a curiosity myself. So come, let us\r\nhave one look at you, Mr. Imp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow as soon as that was said, the imp looked out of the bottle, and in\r\nagain, swift as a lizard; and there sat Keawe and Lopaka turned to\r\nstone. The night had quite come, before either found a thought to say\r\nor voice to say it with; and then Lopaka pushed the money over and took\r\nthe bottle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a man of my word,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand had need to be so, or I would\r\nnot touch this bottle with my foot. Well, I shall get my schooner and a\r\ndollar or two for my pocket; and then I will be rid of this devil as\r\nfast as I can. For to tell you the plain truth, the look of him has\r\ncast me down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLopaka,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not you think any worse of me than you can\r\nhelp; I know it is night, and the roads bad, and the pass by the tombs\r\nan ill place to go by so late, but I declare since I have seen that\r\nlittle face, I cannot eat or sleep or pray till it is gone from me. I\r\nwill give you a lantern and a basket to put the bottle in, and any\r\npicture or fine thing in all my house that takes your fancy;\xe2\x80\x94and be\r\ngone at once, and go sleep at Hookena with Nahinu.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeawe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lopaka, \xe2\x80\x9cmany a man would take this ill; above all, when\r\nI am doing you a turn so friendly, as to keep my word and buy the\r\nbottle; and for that matter, the night and the dark, and the way by the\r\ntombs, must be all tenfold more dangerous to a man with such a sin upon\r\nhis conscience, and such a bottle under his arm. But for my part, I am\r\nso extremely terrified myself, I have not the heart to blame you. Here\r\nI go then; and I pray God you may be happy in your house, and I\r\nfortunate with my schooner, and both get to heaven in the end in spite\r\nof the devil and his bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Lopaka went down the mountain; and Keawe stood in his front balcony,\r\nand listened to the clink of the horse\xe2\x80\x99s shoes, and watched the lantern\r\ngo shining down the path, and along the cliff of caves where the old\r\ndead are buried; and all the time he trembled and clasped his hands,\r\nand prayed for his friend, and gave glory to God that he himself was\r\nescaped out of that trouble.\r\n\r\nBut the next day came very brightly, and that new house of his was so\r\ndelightful to behold that he forgot his terrors. One day followed\r\nanother, and Keawe dwelt there in perpetual joy. He had his place on\r\nthe back porch; it was there he ate and lived, and read the stories in\r\nthe Honolulu newspapers; but when anyone came by they would go in and\r\nview the chambers and the pictures. And the fame of the house went far\r\nand wide; it was called _Ka-Hale Nui_\xe2\x80\x94the Great House\xe2\x80\x94in all Kona; and\r\nsometimes the Bright House, for Keawe kept a Chinaman, who was all day\r\ndusting and furbishing; and the glass, and the gilt, and the fine\r\nstuffs, and the pictures, shone as bright as the morning. As for Keawe\r\nhimself, he could not walk in the chambers without singing, his heart\r\nwas so enlarged; and when ships sailed by upon the sea, he would fly\r\nhis colours on the mast.\r\n\r\nSo time went by, until one day Keawe went upon a visit as far as Kailua\r\nto certain of his friends. There he was well feasted; and left as soon\r\nas he could the next morning, and rode hard, for he was impatient to\r\nbehold his beautiful house; and, besides, the night then coming on was\r\nthe night in which the dead of old days go abroad in the sides of Kona;\r\nand having already meddled with the devil, he was the more chary of\r\nmeeting with the dead. A little beyond Honaunau, looking far ahead, he\r\nwas aware of a woman bathing in the edge of the sea; and she seemed a\r\nwell-grown girl, but he thought no more of it. Then he saw her white\r\nshift flutter as she put it on, and then her red holoku; and by the\r\ntime he came abreast of her she was done with her toilet, and had come\r\nup from the sea, and stood by the track-side in her red holoku, and she\r\nwas all freshened with the bath, and her eyes shone and were kind. Now\r\nKeawe no sooner beheld her than he drew rein.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I knew everyone in this country,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cHow comes it\r\nthat I do not know you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Kokua, daughter of Kiano,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have just\r\nreturned from Oahu. Who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you who I am in a little,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe, dismounting from\r\nhis horse, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not now. For I have a thought in my mind, and if you\r\nknew who I was, you might have heard of me, and would not give me a\r\ntrue answer. But tell me, first of all, one thing: Are you married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this Kokua laughed out aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is you who ask questions,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you married yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, Kokua, I am not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9cand never thought to be\r\nuntil this hour. But here is the plain truth. I have met you here at\r\nthe roadside, and I saw your eyes, which are like the stars, and my\r\nheart went to you as swift as a bird. And so now, if you want none of\r\nme, say so, and I will go on to my own place; but if you think me no\r\nworse than any other young man, say so, too, and I will turn aside to\r\nyour father\xe2\x80\x99s for the night, and to-morrow I will talk with the good\r\nman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKokua said never a word, but she looked at the sea and laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKokua,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9cif you say nothing, I will take that for the good\r\nanswer; so let us be stepping to your father\xe2\x80\x99s door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went on ahead of him, still without speech; only sometimes she\r\nglanced back and glanced away again, and she kept the strings of her\r\nhat in her mouth.\r\n\r\nNow, when they had come to the door, Kiano came out on his verandah,\r\nand cried out and welcomed Keawe by name. At that the girl looked over,\r\nfor the fame of the great house had come to her ears; and, to be sure,\r\nit was a great temptation. All that evening they were very merry\r\ntogether; and the girl was as bold as brass under the eyes of her\r\nparents, and made a mock of Keawe, for she had a quick wit. The next\r\nday he had a word with Kiano, and found the girl alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKokua,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou made a mock of me all the evening; and it is\r\nstill time to bid me go. I would not tell you who I was, because I have\r\nso fine a house, and I feared you would think too much of that house\r\nand too little of the man that loves you. Now you know all, and if you\r\nwish to have seen the last of me, say so at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kokua; but this time she did not laugh, nor did Keawe ask\r\nfor more.\r\n\r\nThis was the wooing of Keawe; things had gone quickly; but so an arrow\r\ngoes, and the ball of a rifle swifter still, and yet both may strike\r\nthe target. Things had gone fast, but they had gone far also, and the\r\nthought of Keawe rang in the maiden\xe2\x80\x99s head; she heard his voice in the\r\nbreach of the surf upon the lava, and for this young man that she had\r\nseen but twice she would have left father and mother and her native\r\nislands. As for Keawe himself, his horse flew up the path of the\r\nmountain under the cliff of tombs, and the sound of the hoofs, and the\r\nsound of Keawe singing to himself for pleasure, echoed in the caverns\r\nof the dead. He came to the Bright House, and still he was singing. He\r\nsat and ate in the broad balcony, and the Chinaman wondered at his\r\nmaster, to hear how he sang between the mouthfuls. The sun went down\r\ninto the sea, and the night came; and Keawe walked the balconies by\r\nlamplight, high on the mountains, and the voice of his singing startled\r\nmen on ships.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere am I now upon my high place,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cLife may be no\r\nbetter; this is the mountain top; and all shelves about me toward the\r\nworse. For the first time I will light up the chambers, and bathe in my\r\nfine bath with the hot water and the cold, and sleep alone in the bed\r\nof my bridal chamber.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the Chinaman had word, and he must rise from sleep and light the\r\nfurnaces; and as he wrought below, beside the boilers, he heard his\r\nmaster singing and rejoicing above him in the lighted chambers. When\r\nthe water began to be hot the Chinaman cried to his master; and Keawe\r\nwent into the bathroom; and the Chinaman heard him sing as he filled\r\nthe marble basin; and heard him sing, and the singing broken, as he\r\nundressed; until of a sudden, the song ceased. The Chinaman listened,\r\nand listened; he called up the house to Keawe to ask if all were well,\r\nand Keawe answered him \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d and bade him go to bed; but there was no\r\nmore singing in the Bright House; and all night long, the Chinaman\r\nheard his master\xe2\x80\x99s feet go round and round the balconies without\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\nNow the truth of it was this: as Keawe undressed for his bath, he spied\r\nupon his flesh a patch like a patch of lichen on a rock, and it was\r\nthen that he stopped singing. For he knew the likeness of that patch,\r\nand knew that he was fallen in the Chinese Evil. [5]\r\n\r\nNow, it is a sad thing for any man to fall into this sickness. And it\r\nwould be a sad thing for anyone to leave a house so beautiful and so\r\ncommodious, and depart from all his friends to the north coast of\r\nMolokai between the mighty cliff and the sea-breakers. But what was\r\nthat to the case of the man Keawe, he who had met his love but\r\nyesterday, and won her but that morning, and now saw all his hopes\r\nbreak, in a moment, like a piece of glass?\r\n\r\nAwhile he sat upon the edge of the bath; then sprang, with a cry, and\r\nran outside; and to and fro, to and fro, along the balcony, like one\r\ndespairing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery willingly could I leave Hawaii, the home of my fathers,\xe2\x80\x9d Keawe\r\nwas thinking. \xe2\x80\x9cVery lightly could I leave my house, the high-placed,\r\nthe many-windowed, here upon the mountains. Very bravely could I go to\r\nMolokai, to Kalaupapa by the cliffs, to live with the smitten and to\r\nsleep there, far from my fathers. But what wrong have I done, what sin\r\nlies upon my soul, that I should have encountered Kokua coming cool\r\nfrom the sea-water in the evening? Kokua, the soul ensnarer! Kokua, the\r\nlight of my life! Her may I never wed, her may I look upon no longer,\r\nher may I no more handle with my loving hand; and it is for this, it is\r\nfor you, O Kokua! that I pour my lamentations!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow you are to observe what sort of a man Keawe was, for he might have\r\ndwelt there in the Bright House for years, and no one been the wiser of\r\nhis sickness; but he reckoned nothing of that, if he must lose Kokua.\r\nAnd again, he might have wed Kokua even as he was; and so many would\r\nhave done, because they have the souls of pigs; but Keawe loved the\r\nmaid manfully, and he would do her no hurt and bring her in no danger.\r\n\r\nA little beyond the midst of the night, there came in his mind the\r\nrecollection of that bottle. He went round to the back porch, and\r\ncalled to memory the day when the devil had looked forth; and at the\r\nthought ice ran in his veins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA dreadful thing is the bottle,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9cand dreadful is the\r\nimp, and it is a dreadful thing to risk the flames of hell. But what\r\nother hope have I to cure my sickness or to wed Kokua? What!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nthought, \xe2\x80\x9cwould I beard the devil once, only to get me a house, and not\r\nface him again to win Kokua?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon he called to mind it was the next day the _Hall_ went by on\r\nher return to Honolulu. \xe2\x80\x9cThere must I go first,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cand see\r\nLopaka. For the best hope that I have now is to find that same bottle I\r\nwas so pleased to be rid of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNever a wink could he sleep; the food stuck in his throat; but he sent\r\na letter to Kiano, and about the time when the steamer would be coming,\r\nrode down beside the cliff of the tombs. It rained; his horse went\r\nheavily; he looked up at the black mouths of the caves, and he envied\r\nthe dead that slept there and were done with trouble; and called to\r\nmind how he had galloped by the day before, and was astonished. So he\r\ncame down to Hookena, and there was all the country gathered for the\r\nsteamer as usual. In the shed before the store they sat and jested and\r\npassed the news; but there was no matter of speech in Keawe\xe2\x80\x99s bosom,\r\nand he sat in their midst and looked without on the rain falling on the\r\nhouses, and the surf beating among the rocks, and the sighs arose in\r\nhis throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeawe of the Bright House is out of spirits,\xe2\x80\x9d said one to another.\r\nIndeed, and so he was, and little wonder.\r\n\r\nThen the _Hall_ came, and the whaleboat carried him on board. The\r\nafter-part of the ship was full of Haoles [6] who had been to visit the\r\nvolcano, as their custom is; and the midst was crowded with Kanakas,\r\nand the forepart with wild bulls from Hilo and horses from Kau; but\r\nKeawe sat apart from all in his sorrow, and watched for the house of\r\nKiano. There it sat, low upon the shore in the black rocks, and shaded\r\nby the cocoa palms, and there by the door was a red holoku, no greater\r\nthan a fly, and going to and fro with a fly\xe2\x80\x99s busyness. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, queen of\r\nmy heart,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll venture my dear soul to win you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoon after, darkness fell, and the cabins were lit up, and the Haoles\r\nsat and played at the cards and drank whiskey as their custom is; but\r\nKeawe walked the deck all night; and all the next day, as they steamed\r\nunder the lee of Maui or of Molokai, he was still pacing to and fro\r\nlike a wild animal in a menagerie.\r\n\r\nTowards evening they passed Diamond Head, and came to the pier of\r\nHonolulu. Keawe stepped out among the crowd and began to ask for\r\nLopaka. It seemed he had become the owner of a schooner\xe2\x80\x94none better in\r\nthe islands\xe2\x80\x94and was gone upon an adventure as far as Pola-Pola or\r\nKahiki; so there was no help to be looked for from Lopaka. Keawe called\r\nto mind a friend of his, a lawyer in the town (I must not tell his\r\nname), and inquired of him. They said he was grown suddenly rich, and\r\nhad a fine new house upon Waikiki shore; and this put a thought in\r\nKeawe\xe2\x80\x99s head, and he called a hack and drove to the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\nThe house was all brand new, and the trees in the garden no greater\r\nthan walking-sticks, and the lawyer, when he came, had the air of a man\r\nwell pleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do to serve you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lawyer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a friend of Lopaka\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9cand Lopaka purchased\r\nfrom me a certain piece of goods that I thought you might enable me to\r\ntrace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s face became very dark. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not profess to misunderstand\r\nyou, Mr. Keawe,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthough this is an ugly business to be\r\nstirring in. You may be sure I know nothing, but yet I have a guess,\r\nand if you would apply in a certain quarter I think you might have\r\nnews.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he named the name of a man, which, again, I had better not repeat.\r\nSo it was for days, and Keawe went from one to another, finding\r\neverywhere new clothes and carriages, and fine new houses and men\r\neverywhere in great contentment, although, to be sure, when he hinted\r\nat his business their faces would cloud over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt I am upon the track,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Keawe. \xe2\x80\x9cThese new clothes and\r\ncarriages are all the gifts of the little imp, and these glad faces are\r\nthe faces of men who have taken their profit and got rid of the\r\naccursed thing in safety. When I see pale cheeks and hear sighing, I\r\nshall know that I am near the bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo it befell at last that he was recommended to a Haole in Beritania\r\nStreet. When he came to the door, about the hour of the evening meal,\r\nthere were the usual marks of the new house, and the young garden, and\r\nthe electric light shining in the windows; but when the owner came, a\r\nshock of hope and fear ran through Keawe; for here was a young man,\r\nwhite as a corpse, and black about the eyes, the hair shedding from his\r\nhead, and such a look in his countenance as a man may have when he is\r\nwaiting for the gallows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Keawe, and so with this man he noways\r\nveiled his errand. \xe2\x80\x9cI am come to buy the bottle,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nAt the word, the young Haole of Beritania Street reeled against the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bottle!\xe2\x80\x9d he gasped. \xe2\x80\x9cTo buy the bottle!\xe2\x80\x9d Then he seemed to choke,\r\nand seizing Keawe by the arm carried him into a room and poured out\r\nwine in two glasses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is my respects,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe, who had been much about with Haoles\r\nin his time. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI am come to buy the bottle. What is the\r\nprice by now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that word the young man let his glass slip through his fingers, and\r\nlooked upon Keawe like a ghost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe price,\xe2\x80\x9d says he; \xe2\x80\x9cthe price! You do not know the price?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is for that I am asking you,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Keawe. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why are you so\r\nmuch concerned? Is there anything wrong about the price?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has dropped a great deal in value since your time, Mr. Keawe,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe young man stammering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, I shall have the less to pay for it,\xe2\x80\x9d says Keawe. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\r\nmuch did it cost you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man was as white as a sheet. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo cents,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9ctwo cents? Why, then, you can only sell it for\r\none. And he who buys it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d The words died upon Keawe\xe2\x80\x99s tongue; he who\r\nbought it could never sell it again, the bottle and the bottle imp must\r\nabide with him until he died, and when he died must carry him to the\r\nred end of hell.\r\n\r\nThe young man of Beritania Street fell upon his knees. \xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake\r\nbuy it!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can have all my fortune in the bargain. I was\r\nmad when I bought it at that price. I had embezzled money at my store;\r\nI was lost else; I must have gone to jail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor creature,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would risk your soul upon so\r\ndesperate an adventure, and to avoid the proper punishment of your own\r\ndisgrace; and you think I could hesitate with love in front of me. Give\r\nme the bottle, and the change which I make sure you have all ready.\r\nHere is a five-cent piece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as Keawe supposed; the young man had the change ready in a\r\ndrawer; the bottle changed hands, and Keawe\xe2\x80\x99s fingers were no sooner\r\nclasped upon the stalk than he had breathed his wish to be a clean man.\r\nAnd, sure enough, when he got home to his room, and stripped himself\r\nbefore a glass, his flesh was whole like an infant\xe2\x80\x99s. And here was the\r\nstrange thing: he had no sooner seen this miracle, than his mind was\r\nchanged within him, and he cared naught for the Chinese Evil, and\r\nlittle enough for Kokua; and had but the one thought, that here he was\r\nbound to the bottle imp for time and for eternity, and had no better\r\nhope but to be a cinder for ever in the flames of hell. Away ahead of\r\nhim he saw them blaze with his mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and his soul shrank, and\r\ndarkness fell upon the light.\r\n\r\nWhen Keawe came to himself a little, he was aware it was the night when\r\nthe band played at the hotel. Thither he went, because he feared to be\r\nalone; and there, among happy faces, walked to and fro, and heard the\r\ntunes go up and down, and saw Berger beat the measure, and all the\r\nwhile he heard the flames crackle, and saw the red fire burning in the\r\nbottomless pit. Of a sudden the band played _Hiki-ao-ao_; that was a\r\nsong that he had sung with Kokua, and at the strain courage returned to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is done now,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cand once more let me take the good along\r\nwith the evil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo it befell that he returned to Hawaii by the first steamer, and as\r\nsoon as it could be managed he was wedded to Kokua, and carried her up\r\nthe mountain side to the Bright House.\r\n\r\nNow it was so with these two, that when they were together, Keawe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart was stilled; but so soon as he was alone he fell into a brooding\r\nhorror, and heard the flames crackle, and saw the red fire burn in the\r\nbottomless pit. The girl, indeed, had come to him wholly; her heart\r\nleapt in her side at sight of him, her hand clung to his; and she was\r\nso fashioned from the hair upon her head to the nails upon her toes\r\nthat none could see her without joy. She was pleasant in her nature.\r\nShe had the good word always. Full of song she was, and went to and fro\r\nin the Bright House, the brightest thing in its three storeys,\r\ncarolling like the birds. And Keawe beheld and heard her with delight,\r\nand then must shrink upon one side, and weep and groan to think upon\r\nthe price that he had paid for her; and then he must dry his eyes, and\r\nwash his face, and go and sit with her on the broad balconies, joining\r\nin her songs, and, with a sick spirit, answering her smiles.\r\n\r\nThere came a day when her feet began to be heavy and her songs more\r\nrare; and now it was not Keawe only that would weep apart, but each\r\nwould sunder from the other and sit in opposite balconies with the\r\nwhole width of the Bright House betwixt. Keawe was so sunk in his\r\ndespair, he scarce observed the change, and was only glad he had more\r\nhours to sit alone and brood upon his destiny, and was not so\r\nfrequently condemned to pull a smiling face on a sick heart. But one\r\nday, coming softly through the house, he heard the sound of a child\r\nsobbing, and there was Kokua rolling her face upon the balcony floor,\r\nand weeping like the lost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do well to weep in this house, Kokua,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet I would\r\ngive the head off my body that you (at least) might have been happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHappy!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried. \xe2\x80\x9cKeawe, when you lived alone in your Bright House,\r\nyou were the word of the island for a happy man; laughter and song were\r\nin your mouth, and your face was as bright as the sunrise. Then you\r\nwedded poor Kokua; and the good God knows what is amiss in her\xe2\x80\x94but from\r\nthat day you have not smiled. Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat ails me? I thought\r\nI was pretty, and I knew I loved him. What ails me that I throw this\r\ncloud upon my husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Kokua,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe. He sat down by her side, and sought to take\r\nher hand; but that she plucked away. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Kokua,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, again. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\npoor child\xe2\x80\x94my pretty. And I had thought all this while to spare you!\r\nWell, you shall know all. Then, at least, you will pity poor Keawe;\r\nthen you will understand how much he loved you in the past\xe2\x80\x94that he\r\ndared hell for your possession\xe2\x80\x94and how much he loves you still (the\r\npoor condemned one), that he can yet call up a smile when he beholds\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, he told her all, even from the beginning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have done this for me?\xe2\x80\x9d she cried \xe2\x80\x9cAh, well, then what do I\r\ncare!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and she clasped and wept upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, child!\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9cand yet, when I consider of the fire of hell,\r\nI care a good deal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cno man can be lost because he loved Kokua,\r\nand no other fault. I tell you, Keawe, I shall save you with these\r\nhands, or perish in your company. What! you loved me, and gave your\r\nsoul, and you think I will not die to save you in return?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my dear! you might die a hundred times, and what difference would\r\nthat make?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept to leave me lonely till the time comes of\r\nmy damnation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cI was educated in a school in Honolulu;\r\nI am no common girl. And I tell you, I shall save my lover. What is\r\nthis you say about a cent? But all the world is not American. In\r\nEngland they have a piece they call a farthing, which is about half a\r\ncent. Ah! sorrow!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthat makes it scarcely better, for the\r\nbuyer must be lost, and we shall find none so brave as my Keawe! But,\r\nthen, there is France; they have a small coin there which they call a\r\ncentime, and these go five to the cent or there-about. We could not do\r\nbetter. Come, Keawe, let us go to the French islands; let us go to\r\nTahiti, as fast as ships can bear us. There we have four centimes,\r\nthree centimes, two centimes, one centime; four possible sales to come\r\nand go on; and two of us to push the bargain. Come, my Keawe! kiss me,\r\nand banish care. Kokua will defend you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGift of God!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot think that God will punish me for\r\ndesiring aught so good! Be it as you will, then; take me where you\r\nplease: I put my life and my salvation in your hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEarly the next day Kokua was about her preparations. She took Keawe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchest that he went with sailoring; and first she put the bottle in a\r\ncorner; and then packed it with the richest of their clothes and the\r\nbravest of the knick-knacks in the house. \xe2\x80\x9cFor,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must\r\nseem to be rich folks, or who will believe in the bottle?\xe2\x80\x9d All the time\r\nof her preparation she was as gay as a bird; only when she looked upon\r\nKeawe, the tears would spring in her eye, and she must run and kiss\r\nhim. As for Keawe, a weight was off his soul; now that he had his\r\nsecret shared, and some hope in front of him, he seemed like a new man,\r\nhis feet went lightly on the earth, and his breath was good to him\r\nagain. Yet was terror still at his elbow; and ever and again, as the\r\nwind blows out a taper, hope died in him, and he saw the flames toss\r\nand the red fire burn in hell.\r\n\r\nIt was given out in the country they were gone pleasuring to the\r\nStates, which was thought a strange thing, and yet not so strange as\r\nthe truth, if any could have guessed it. So they went to Honolulu in\r\nthe _Hall_, and thence in the _Umatilla_ to San Francisco with a crowd\r\nof Haoles, and at San Francisco took their passage by the mail\r\nbrigantine, the _Tropic Bird_, for Papeete, the chief place of the\r\nFrench in the south islands. Thither they came, after a pleasant\r\nvoyage, on a fair day of the Trade Wind, and saw the reef with the surf\r\nbreaking, and Motuiti with its palms, and the schooner riding\r\nwithin-side, and the white houses of the town low down along the shore\r\namong green trees, and overhead the mountains and the clouds of Tahiti,\r\nthe wise island.\r\n\r\nIt was judged the most wise to hire a house, which they did\r\naccordingly, opposite the British Consul\xe2\x80\x99s, to make a great parade of\r\nmoney, and themselves conspicuous with carriages and horses. This it\r\nwas very easy to do, so long as they had the bottle in their\r\npossession; for Kokua was more bold than Keawe, and, whenever she had a\r\nmind, called on the imp for twenty or a hundred dollars. At this rate\r\nthey soon grew to be remarked in the town; and the strangers from\r\nHawaii, their riding and their driving, the fine holokus and the rich\r\nlace of Kokua, became the matter of much talk.\r\n\r\nThey got on well after the first with the Tahitian language, which is\r\nindeed like to the Hawaiian, with a change of certain letters; and as\r\nsoon as they had any freedom of speech, began to push the bottle. You\r\nare to consider it was not an easy subject to introduce; it was not\r\neasy to persuade people you were in earnest, when you offered to sell\r\nthem for four centimes the spring of health and riches inexhaustible.\r\nIt was necessary besides to explain the dangers of the bottle; and\r\neither people disbelieved the whole thing and laughed, or they thought\r\nthe more of the darker part, became overcast with gravity, and drew\r\naway from Keawe and Kokua, as from persons who had dealings with the\r\ndevil. So far from gaining ground, these two began to find they were\r\navoided in the town; the children ran away from them screaming, a thing\r\nintolerable to Kokua; Catholics crossed themselves as they went by; and\r\nall persons began with one accord to disengage themselves from their\r\nadvances.\r\n\r\nDepression fell upon their spirits. They would sit at night in their\r\nnew house, after a day\xe2\x80\x99s weariness, and not exchange one word, or the\r\nsilence would be broken by Kokua bursting suddenly into sobs. Sometimes\r\nthey would pray together; sometimes they would have the bottle out upon\r\nthe floor, and sit all evening watching how the shadow hovered in the\r\nmidst. At such times they would be afraid to go to rest. It was long\r\nere slumber came to them, and, if either dozed off, it would be to wake\r\nand find the other silently weeping in the dark, or, perhaps, to wake\r\nalone, the other having fled from the house and the neighbourhood of\r\nthat bottle, to pace under the bananas in the little garden, or to\r\nwander on the beach by moonlight.\r\n\r\nOne night it was so when Kokua awoke. Keawe was gone. She felt in the\r\nbed and his place was cold. Then fear fell upon her, and she sat up in\r\nbed. A little moonshine filtered through the shutters. The room was\r\nbright, and she could spy the bottle on the floor. Outside it blew\r\nhigh, the great trees of the avenue cried aloud, and the fallen leaves\r\nrattled in the verandah. In the midst of this Kokua was aware of\r\nanother sound; whether of a beast or of a man she could scarce tell,\r\nbut it was as sad as death, and cut her to the soul. Softly she arose,\r\nset the door ajar, and looked forth into the moonlit yard. There, under\r\nthe bananas, lay Keawe, his mouth in the dust, and as he lay he moaned.\r\n\r\nIt was Kokua\xe2\x80\x99s first thought to run forward and console him; her second\r\npotently withheld her. Keawe had borne himself before his wife like a\r\nbrave man; it became her little in the hour of weakness to intrude upon\r\nhis shame. With the thought she drew back into the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeaven!\xe2\x80\x9d she thought, \xe2\x80\x9chow careless have I been\xe2\x80\x94how weak! It is he,\r\nnot I, that stands in this eternal peril; it was he, not I, that took\r\nthe curse upon his soul. It is for my sake, and for the love of a\r\ncreature of so little worth and such poor help, that he now beholds so\r\nclose to him the flames of hell\xe2\x80\x94ay, and smells the smoke of it, lying\r\nwithout there in the wind and moonlight. Am I so dull of spirit that\r\nnever till now I have surmised my duty, or have I seen it before and\r\nturned aside? But now, at least, I take up my soul in both the hands of\r\nmy affection; now I say farewell to the white steps of heaven and the\r\nwaiting faces of my friends. A love for a love, and let mine be\r\nequalled with Keawe\xe2\x80\x99s! A soul for a soul, and be it mine to perish!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was a deft woman with her hands, and was soon apparelled. She took\r\nin her hands the change\xe2\x80\x94the precious centimes they kept ever at their\r\nside; for this coin is little used, and they had made provision at a\r\nGovernment office. When she was forth in the avenue clouds came on the\r\nwind, and the moon was blackened. The town slept, and she knew not\r\nwhither to turn till she heard one coughing in the shadow of the trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kokua, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you here abroad in the cold night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man could scarce express himself for coughing, but she made out\r\nthat he was old and poor, and a stranger in the island.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you do me a service?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kokua. \xe2\x80\x9cAs one stranger to another,\r\nand as an old man to a young woman, will you help a daughter of\r\nHawaii?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you are the witch from the eight islands,\r\nand even my old soul you seek to entangle. But I have heard of you, and\r\ndefy your wickedness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kokua, \xe2\x80\x9cand let me tell you a tale.\xe2\x80\x9d And she told\r\nhim the story of Keawe from the beginning to the end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI am his wife, whom he bought with his soul\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwelfare. And what should I do? If I went to him myself and offered to\r\nbuy it, he would refuse. But if you go, he will sell it eagerly; I will\r\nawait you here; you will buy it for four centimes, and I will buy it\r\nagain for three. And the Lord strengthen a poor girl!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you meant falsely,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cI think God would strike you\r\ndead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Kokua. \xe2\x80\x9cBe sure he would. I could not be so\r\ntreacherous\xe2\x80\x94God would not suffer it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me the four centimes and await me here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\nNow, when Kokua stood alone in the street, her spirit died. The wind\r\nroared in the trees, and it seemed to her the rushing of the flames of\r\nhell; the shadows tossed in the light of the street lamp, and they\r\nseemed to her the snatching hands of evil ones. If she had had the\r\nstrength, she must have run away, and if she had had the breath she\r\nmust have screamed aloud; but, in truth, she could do neither, and\r\nstood and trembled in the avenue, like an affrighted child.\r\n\r\nThen she saw the old man returning, and he had the bottle in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have done your bidding,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI left your husband weeping like\r\na child; to-night he will sleep easy.\xe2\x80\x9d And he held the bottle forth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBefore you give it me,\xe2\x80\x9d Kokua panted, \xe2\x80\x9ctake the good with the evil\xe2\x80\x94ask\r\nto be delivered from your cough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am an old man,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other, \xe2\x80\x9cand too near the gate of the\r\ngrave to take a favour from the devil. But what is this? Why do you not\r\ntake the bottle? Do you hesitate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot hesitate!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Kokua. \xe2\x80\x9cI am only weak. Give me a moment. It is\r\nmy hand resists, my flesh shrinks back from the accursed thing. One\r\nmoment only!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man looked upon Kokua kindly. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor child!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou fear;\r\nyour soul misgives you. Well, let me keep it. I am old, and can never\r\nmore be happy in this world, and as for the next\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it me!\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Kokua. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is your money. Do you think I am so\r\nbase as that? Give me the bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you, child,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man.\r\n\r\nKokua concealed the bottle under her holoku, said farewell to the old\r\nman, and walked off along the avenue, she cared not whither. For all\r\nroads were now the same to her, and led equally to hell. Sometimes she\r\nwalked, and sometimes ran; sometimes she screamed out loud in the\r\nnight, and sometimes lay by the wayside in the dust and wept. All that\r\nshe had heard of hell came back to her; she saw the flames blaze, and\r\nshe smelt the smoke, and her flesh withered on the coals.\r\n\r\nNear day she came to her mind again, and returned to the house. It was\r\neven as the old man said\xe2\x80\x94Keawe slumbered like a child. Kokua stood and\r\ngazed upon his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, my husband,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cit is your turn to sleep. When you wake\r\nit will be your turn to sing and laugh. But for poor Kokua, alas! that\r\nmeant no evil\xe2\x80\x94for poor Kokua no more sleep, no more singing, no more\r\ndelight, whether in earth or heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that she lay down in the bed by his side, and her misery was so\r\nextreme that she fell in a deep slumber instantly.\r\n\r\nLate in the morning her husband woke her and gave her the good news. It\r\nseemed he was silly with delight, for he paid no heed to her distress,\r\nill though she dissembled it. The words stuck in her mouth, it mattered\r\nnot; Keawe did the speaking. She ate not a bite, but who was to observe\r\nit? for Keawe cleared the dish. Kokua saw and heard him, like some\r\nstrange thing in a dream; there were times when she forgot or doubted,\r\nand put her hands to her brow; to know herself doomed and hear her\r\nhusband babble, seemed so monstrous.\r\n\r\nAll the while Keawe was eating and talking, and planning the time of\r\ntheir return, and thanking her for saving him, and fondling her, and\r\ncalling her the true helper after all. He laughed at the old man that\r\nwas fool enough to buy that bottle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA worthy old man he seemed,\xe2\x80\x9d Keawe said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut no one can judge by\r\nappearances. For why did the old reprobate require the bottle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kokua, humbly, \xe2\x80\x9chis purpose may have been good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nKeawe laughed like an angry man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFiddle-de-dee!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Keawe. \xe2\x80\x9cAn old rogue, I tell you; and an old ass\r\nto boot. For the bottle was hard enough to sell at four centimes; and\r\nat three it will be quite impossible. The margin is not broad enough,\r\nthe thing begins to smell of scorching\xe2\x80\x94brrr!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and shuddered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true I bought it myself at a cent, when I knew not there were\r\nsmaller coins. I was a fool for my pains; there will never be found\r\nanother: and whoever has that bottle now will carry it to the pit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO my husband!\xe2\x80\x9d said Kokua. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it not a terrible thing to save oneself\r\nby the eternal ruin of another? It seems to me I could not laugh. I\r\nwould be humbled. I would be filled with melancholy. I would pray for\r\nthe poor holder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Keawe, because he felt the truth of what she said, grew the more\r\nangry. \xe2\x80\x9cHeighty-teighty!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may be filled with melancholy\r\nif you please. It is not the mind of a good wife. If you thought at all\r\nof me, you would sit shamed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon he went out, and Kokua was alone.\r\n\r\nWhat chance had she to sell that bottle at two centimes? None, she\r\nperceived. And if she had any, here was her husband hurrying her away\r\nto a country where there was nothing lower than a cent. And here\xe2\x80\x94on the\r\nmorrow of her sacrifice\xe2\x80\x94was her husband leaving her and blaming her.\r\n\r\nShe would not even try to profit by what time she had, but sat in the\r\nhouse, and now had the bottle out and viewed it with unutterable fear,\r\nand now, with loathing, hid it out of sight.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by, Keawe came back, and would have her take a drive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband, I am ill,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am out of heart. Excuse me, I can\r\ntake no pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen was Keawe more wroth than ever. With her, because he thought she\r\nwas brooding over the case of the old man; and with himself, because he\r\nthought she was right, and was ashamed to be so happy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is your truth,\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, \xe2\x80\x9cand this your affection! Your husband\r\nis just saved from eternal ruin, which he encountered for the love of\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94and you can take no pleasure! Kokua, you have a disloyal heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went forth again furious, and wandered in the town all day. He met\r\nfriends, and drank with them; they hired a carriage and drove into the\r\ncountry, and there drank again. All the time Keawe was ill at ease,\r\nbecause he was taking this pastime while his wife was sad, and because\r\nhe knew in his heart that she was more right than he; and the knowledge\r\nmade him drink the deeper.\r\n\r\nNow there was an old brutal Haole drinking with him, one that had been\r\na boatswain of a whaler, a runaway, a digger in gold mines, a convict\r\nin prisons. He had a low mind and a foul mouth; he loved to drink and\r\nto see others drunken; and he pressed the glass upon Keawe. Soon there\r\nwas no more money in the company.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, you!\xe2\x80\x9d says the boatswain, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are rich, you have been always\r\nsaying. You have a bottle or some foolishness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d says Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9cI am rich; I will go back and get some money from\r\nmy wife, who keeps it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a bad idea, mate,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boatswain. \xe2\x80\x9cNever you trust a\r\npetticoat with dollars. They\xe2\x80\x99re all as false as water; you keep an eye\r\non her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow, this word struck in Keawe\xe2\x80\x99s mind; for he was muddled with what he\r\nhad been drinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should not wonder but she was false, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy else\r\nshould she be so cast down at my release? But I will show her I am not\r\nthe man to be fooled. I will catch her in the act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when they were back in town, Keawe bade the boatswain wait\r\nfor him at the corner, by the old calaboose, and went forward up the\r\navenue alone to the door of his house. The night had come again; there\r\nwas a light within, but never a sound; and Keawe crept about the\r\ncorner, opened the back door softly, and looked in.\r\n\r\nThere was Kokua on the floor, the lamp at her side; before her was a\r\nmilk-white bottle, with a round belly and a long neck; and as she\r\nviewed it, Kokua wrung her hands.\r\n\r\nA long time Keawe stood and looked in the doorway. At first he was\r\nstruck stupid; and then fear fell upon him that the bargain had been\r\nmade amiss, and the bottle had come back to him as it came at San\r\nFrancisco; and at that his knees were loosened, and the fumes of the\r\nwine departed from his head like mists off a river in the morning. And\r\nthen he had another thought; and it was a strange one, that made his\r\ncheeks to burn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must make sure of this,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he.\r\n\r\nSo he closed the door, and went softly round the corner again, and then\r\ncame noisily in, as though he were but now returned. And, lo! by the\r\ntime he opened the front door no bottle was to be seen; and Kokua sat\r\nin a chair and started up like one awakened out of sleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been drinking all day and making merry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nbeen with good companions, and now I only come back for money, and\r\nreturn to drink and carouse with them again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBoth his face and voice were as stern as judgment, but Kokua was too\r\ntroubled to observe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do well to use your own, my husband,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, and her words\r\ntrembled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I do well in all things,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe, and he went straight to the\r\nchest and took out money. But he looked besides in the corner where\r\nthey kept the bottle, and there was no bottle there.\r\n\r\nAt that the chest heaved upon the floor like a sea-billow, and the\r\nhouse span about him like a wreath of smoke, for he saw he was lost\r\nnow, and there was no escape. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is what I feared,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nshe who has bought it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then he came to himself a little and rose up; but the sweat\r\nstreamed on his face as thick as the rain and as cold as the\r\nwell-water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKokua,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI said to you to-day what ill became me. Now I\r\nreturn to carouse with my jolly companions,\xe2\x80\x9d and at that he laughed a\r\nlittle quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cI will take more pleasure in the cup if you forgive\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe clasped his knees in a moment; she kissed his knees with flowing\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO,\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cI asked but a kind word!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us never one think hardly of the other,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe, and was gone\r\nout of the house.\r\n\r\nNow, the money that Keawe had taken was only some of that store of\r\ncentime pieces they had laid in at their arrival. It was very sure he\r\nhad no mind to be drinking. His wife had given her soul for him, now he\r\nmust give his for hers; no other thought was in the world with him.\r\n\r\nAt the corner, by the old calaboose, there was the boatswain waiting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife has the bottle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9cand, unless you help me to\r\nrecover it, there can be no more money and no more liquor to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not mean to say you are serious about that bottle?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\nboatswain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is the lamp,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe. \xe2\x80\x9cDo I look as if I was jesting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boatswain. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look as serious as a ghost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9chere are two centimes; you must go to my\r\nwife in the house, and offer her these for the bottle, which (if I am\r\nnot much mistaken) she will give you instantly. Bring it to me here,\r\nand I will buy it back from you for one; for that is the law with this\r\nbottle, that it still must be sold for a less sum. But whatever you do,\r\nnever breathe a word to her that you have come from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMate, I wonder are you making a fool of me?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the boatswain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will do you no harm if I am,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Keawe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is so, mate,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boatswain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you doubt me,\xe2\x80\x9d added Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can try. As soon as you are\r\nclear of the house, wish to have your pocket full of money, or a bottle\r\nof the best rum, or what you please, and you will see the virtue of the\r\nthing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Kanaka,\xe2\x80\x9d says the boatswain. \xe2\x80\x9cI will try; but if you are\r\nhaving your fun out of me, I will take my fun out of you with a\r\nbelaying pin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the whaler-man went off up the avenue; and Keawe stood and waited.\r\nIt was near the same spot where Kokua had waited the night before; but\r\nKeawe was more resolved, and never faltered in his purpose; only his\r\nsoul was bitter with despair.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a long time he had to wait before he heard a voice singing in\r\nthe darkness of the avenue. He knew the voice to be the boatswain\xe2\x80\x99s;\r\nbut it was strange how drunken it appeared upon a sudden.\r\n\r\nNext, the man himself came stumbling into the light of the lamp. He had\r\nthe devil\xe2\x80\x99s bottle buttoned in his coat; another bottle was in his\r\nhand; and even as he came in view he raised it to his mouth and drank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe. \xe2\x80\x9cI see that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHands off!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boatswain, jumping back. \xe2\x80\x9cTake a step near me,\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll smash your mouth. You thought you could make a cat\xe2\x80\x99s-paw of\r\nme, did you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Keawe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMean?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boatswain. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a pretty good bottle, this is;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean. How I got it for two centimes I can\xe2\x80\x99t make out; but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you shan\xe2\x80\x99t have it for one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean you won\xe2\x80\x99t sell?\xe2\x80\x9d gasped Keawe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, _sir_!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the boatswain. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you a drink of the\r\nrum, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keawe, \xe2\x80\x9cthe man who has that bottle goes to hell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon I\xe2\x80\x99m going anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sailor; \xe2\x80\x9cand this bottle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe best thing to go with I\xe2\x80\x99ve struck yet. No, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried again,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthis is my bottle now, and you can go and fish for another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan this be true?\xe2\x80\x9d Keawe cried. \xe2\x80\x9cFor your own sake, I beseech you,\r\nsell it me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t value any of your talk,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the boatswain. \xe2\x80\x9cYou thought I\r\nwas a flat; now you see I\xe2\x80\x99m not; and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end. If you won\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\na swallow of the rum, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have one myself. Here\xe2\x80\x99s your health, and\r\ngood-night to you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo off he went down the avenue towards town, and there goes the bottle\r\nout of the story.\r\n\r\nBut Keawe ran to Kokua light as the wind; and great was their joy that\r\nnight; and great, since then, has been the peace of all their days in\r\nthe Bright House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISLE OF VOICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeola was married with Lehua, daughter of Kalamake, the wise man of\r\nMolokai, and he kept his dwelling with the father of his wife. There\r\nwas no man more cunning than that prophet; he read the stars, he could\r\ndivine by the bodies of the dead, and by the means of evil creatures:\r\nhe could go alone into the highest parts of the mountain, into the\r\nregion of the hobgoblins, and there he would lay snares to entrap the\r\nspirits of the ancient.\r\n\r\nFor this reason no man was more consulted in all the Kingdom of Hawaii.\r\nPrudent people bought, and sold, and married, and laid out their lives\r\nby his counsels; and the King had him twice to Kona to seek the\r\ntreasures of Kamehameha. Neither was any man more feared: of his\r\nenemies, some had dwindled in sickness by the virtue of his\r\nincantations, and some had been spirited away, the life and the clay\r\nboth, so that folk looked in vain for so much as a bone of their\r\nbodies. It was rumoured that he had the art or the gift of the old\r\nheroes. Men had seen him at night upon the mountains, stepping from one\r\ncliff to the next; they had seen him walking in the high forest, and\r\nhis head and shoulders were above the trees.\r\n\r\nThis Kalamake was a strange man to see. He was come of the best blood\r\nin Molokai and Maui, of a pure descent; and yet he was more white to\r\nlook upon than any foreigner: his hair the colour of dry grass, and his\r\neyes red and very blind, so that \xe2\x80\x9cBlind as Kalamake, that can see\r\nacross to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d was a byword in the islands.\r\n\r\nOf all these doings of his father-in-law, Keola knew a little by the\r\ncommon repute, a little more he suspected, and the rest he ignored. But\r\nthere was one thing troubled him. Kalamake was a man that spared for\r\nnothing, whether to eat or to drink, or to wear; and for all he paid in\r\nbright new dollars. \xe2\x80\x9cBright as Kalamake\xe2\x80\x99s dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d was another saying\r\nin the Eight Isles. Yet he neither sold, nor planted, nor took\r\nhire\xe2\x80\x94only now and then from his sorceries\xe2\x80\x94and there was no source\r\nconceivable for so much silver coin.\r\n\r\nIt chanced one day Keola\xe2\x80\x99s wife was gone upon a visit to Kaunakakai, on\r\nthe lee side of the island, and the men were forth at the sea-fishing.\r\nBut Keola was an idle dog, and he lay in the verandah and watched the\r\nsurf beat on the shore and the birds fly about the cliff. It was a\r\nchief thought with him always\xe2\x80\x94the thought of the bright dollars. When\r\nhe lay down to bed he would be wondering why they were so many, and\r\nwhen he woke at morn he would be wondering why they were all new; and\r\nthe thing was never absent from his mind. But this day of all days he\r\nmade sure in his heart of some discovery. For it seems he had observed\r\nthe place where Kalamake kept his treasure, which was a lock-fast desk\r\nagainst the parlour wall, under the print of Kamehameha the Fifth, and\r\na photograph of Queen Victoria with her crown; and it seems again that,\r\nno later than the night before, he found occasion to look in, and\r\nbehold! the bag lay there empty. And this was the day of the steamer;\r\nhe could see her smoke off Kalaupapa; and she must soon arrive with a\r\nmonth\xe2\x80\x99s goods, tinned salmon and gin, and all manner of rare luxuries\r\nfor Kalamake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow if he can pay for his goods to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d Keola thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall know\r\nfor certain that the man is a warlock, and the dollars come out of the\r\nDevil\xe2\x80\x99s pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he was so thinking, there was his father-in-law behind him,\r\nlooking vexed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the steamer?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keola. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has but to call at Pelekunu, and then she will\r\nbe here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no help for it then,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Kalamake, \xe2\x80\x9cand I must take you\r\nin my confidence, Keola, for the lack of anyone better. Come here\r\nwithin the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo they stepped together into the parlour, which was a very fine room,\r\npapered and hung with prints, and furnished with a rocking-chair, and a\r\ntable and a sofa in the European style. There was a shelf of books\r\nbesides, and a family Bible in the midst of the table, and the\r\nlock-fast writing desk against the wall; so that anyone could see it\r\nwas the house of a man of substance.\r\n\r\nKalamake made Keola close the shutters of the windows, while he himself\r\nlocked all the doors and set open the lid of the desk. From this he\r\nbrought forth a pair of necklaces hung with charms and shells, a bundle\r\nof dried herbs, and the dried leaves of trees, and a green branch of\r\npalm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I am about,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cis a thing beyond wonder. The men of old\r\nwere wise; they wrought marvels, and this among the rest; but that was\r\nat night, in the dark, under the fit stars and in the desert. The same\r\nwill I do here in my own house and under the plain eye of day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he put the bible under the cushion of the sofa so that it\r\nwas all covered, brought out from the same place a mat of a wonderfully\r\nfine texture, and heaped the herbs and leaves on sand in a tin pan. And\r\nthen he and Keola put on the necklaces and took their stand upon the\r\nopposite corners of the mat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time comes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the warlock; \xe2\x80\x9cbe not afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he set flame to the herbs, and began to mutter and wave the\r\nbranch of palm. At first the light was dim because of the closed\r\nshutters; but the herbs caught strongly afire, and the flames beat upon\r\nKeola, and the room glowed with the burning; and next the smoke rose\r\nand made his head swim and his eyes darken, and the sound of Kalamake\r\nmuttering ran in his ears. And suddenly, to the mat on which they were\r\nstanding came a snatch or twitch, that seemed to be more swift than\r\nlightning. In the same wink the room was gone and the house, the breath\r\nall beaten from Keola\xe2\x80\x99s body. Volumes of light rolled upon his eyes and\r\nhead, and he found himself transported to a beach of the sea under a\r\nstrong sun, with a great surf roaring: he and the warlock standing\r\nthere on the same mat, speechless, gasping and grasping at one another,\r\nand passing their hands before their eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was this?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Keola, who came to himself the first, because he\r\nwas the younger. \xe2\x80\x9cThe pang of it was like death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt matters not,\xe2\x80\x9d panted Kalamake. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is now done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, in the name of God, where are we?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Keola.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not the question,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sorcerer. \xe2\x80\x9cBeing here, we have\r\nmatter in our hands, and that we must attend to. Go, while I recover my\r\nbreath, into the borders of the wood, and bring me the leaves of such\r\nand such a herb, and such and such a tree, which you will find to grow\r\nthere plentifully\xe2\x80\x94three handfuls of each. And be speedy. We must be\r\nhome again before the steamer comes; it would seem strange if we had\r\ndisappeared.\xe2\x80\x9d And he sat on the sand and panted.\r\n\r\nKeola went up the beach, which was of shining sand and coral, strewn\r\nwith singular shells; and he thought in his heart\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do I not know this beach? I will come here again and gather\r\nshells.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn front of him was a line of palms against the sky; not like the palms\r\nof the Eight Islands, but tall and fresh and beautiful, and hanging out\r\nwithered fans like gold among the green, and he thought in his heart\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is strange I should not have found this grove. I will come here\r\nagain, when it is warm, to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d And he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cHow warm it has\r\ngrown suddenly!\xe2\x80\x9d For it was winter in Hawaii, and the day had been\r\nchill. And he thought also, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are the grey mountains? And where is\r\nthe high cliff with the hanging forest and the wheeling birds?\xe2\x80\x9d And the\r\nmore he considered, the less he might conceive in what quarter of the\r\nislands he was fallen.\r\n\r\nIn the border of the grove, where it met the beach, the herb was\r\ngrowing, but the tree further back. Now, as Keola went toward the tree,\r\nhe was aware of a young woman who had nothing on her body but a belt of\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Keola, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are not very particular about their dress\r\nin this part of the country.\xe2\x80\x9d And he paused, supposing she would\r\nobserve him and escape; and seeing that she still looked before her,\r\nstood and hummed aloud. Up she leaped at the sound. Her face was ashen;\r\nshe looked this way and that, and her mouth gaped with the terror of\r\nher soul. But it was a strange thing that her eyes did not rest upon\r\nKeola.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood day,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou need not be so frightened; I will not eat\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d And he had scarce opened his mouth before the young woman fled\r\ninto the bush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese are strange manners,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Keola. And, not thinking what he\r\ndid, ran after her.\r\n\r\nAs she ran, the girl kept crying in some speech that was not practised\r\nin Hawaii, yet some of the words were the same, and he knew she kept\r\ncalling and warning others. And presently he saw more people\r\nrunning\xe2\x80\x94men, women and children, one with another, all running and\r\ncrying like people at a fire. And with that he began to grow afraid\r\nhimself, and returned to Kalamake bringing the leaves. Him he told what\r\nhe had seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must pay no heed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kalamake. \xe2\x80\x9cAll this is like a dream and\r\nshadows. All will disappear and be forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seemed none saw me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keola.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd none did,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sorcerer. \xe2\x80\x9cWe walk here in the broad sun\r\ninvisible by reason of these charms. Yet they hear us; and therefore it\r\nis well to speak softly, as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he made a circle round the mat with stones, and in the midst\r\nhe set the leaves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be your part,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cto keep the leaves alight, and feed\r\nthe fire slowly. While they blaze (which is but for a little moment) I\r\nmust do my errand; and before the ashes blacken, the same power that\r\nbrought us carries us away. Be ready now with the match; and do you\r\ncall me in good time lest the flames burn out and I be left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as the leaves caught, the sorcerer leaped like a deer out of\r\nthe circle, and began to race along the beach like a hound that has\r\nbeen bathing. As he ran, he kept stooping to snatch shells; and it\r\nseemed to Keola that they glittered as he took them. The leaves blazed\r\nwith a clear flame that consumed them swiftly; and presently Keola had\r\nbut a handful left, and the sorcerer was far off, running and stopping.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBack!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Keola. \xe2\x80\x9cBack! The leaves are near done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that Kalamake turned, and if he had run before, now he flew. But\r\nfast as he ran, the leaves burned faster. The flame was ready to expire\r\nwhen, with a great leap, he bounded on the mat. The wind of his leaping\r\nblew it out; and with that the beach was gone, and the sun and the sea,\r\nand they stood once more in the dimness of the shuttered parlour, and\r\nwere once more shaken and blinded; and on the mat betwixt them lay a\r\npile of shining dollars. Keola ran to the shutters; and there was the\r\nsteamer tossing in the swell close in.\r\n\r\nThe same night Kalamake took his son-in-law apart, and gave him five\r\ndollars in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeola,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cif you are a wise man (which I am doubtful of) you\r\nwill think you slept this afternoon on the verandah, and dreamed as you\r\nwere sleeping. I am a man of few words, and I have for my helpers\r\npeople of short memories.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNever a word more said Kalamake, nor referred again to that affair. But\r\nit ran all the while in Keola\xe2\x80\x99s head\xe2\x80\x94if he were lazy before, he would\r\nnow do nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I work,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I have a father-in-law who makes\r\ndollars of sea-shells?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently his share was spent. He spent it all upon fine clothes. And\r\nthen he was sorry:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, \xe2\x80\x9cI had done better to have bought a concertina, with\r\nwhich I might have entertained myself all day long.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he began\r\nto grow vexed with Kalamake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis man has the soul of a dog,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can gather dollars\r\nwhen he pleases on the beach, and he leaves me to pine for a\r\nconcertina! Let him beware: I am no child, I am as cunning as he, and\r\nhold his secret.\xe2\x80\x9d With that he spoke to his wife Lehua, and complained\r\nof her father\xe2\x80\x99s manners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would let my father be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lehua. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a dangerous man to\r\ncross.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI care that for him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Keola; and snapped his fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cI have\r\nhim by the nose. I can make him do what I please.\xe2\x80\x9d And he told Lehua\r\nthe story.\r\n\r\nBut she shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may do what you like,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cbut as sure as you thwart my\r\nfather, you will be no more heard of. Think of this person, and that\r\nperson; think of Hua, who was a noble of the House of Representatives,\r\nand went to Honolulu every year; and not a bone or a hair of him was\r\nfound. Remember Kamau, and how he wasted to a thread, so that his wife\r\nlifted him with one hand. Keola, you are a baby in my father\xe2\x80\x99s hands;\r\nhe will take you with his thumb and finger and eat you like a shrimp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow Keola was truly afraid of Kalamake, but he was vain too; and these\r\nwords of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s incensed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cif that is what you think of me, I will show how\r\nmuch you are deceived.\xe2\x80\x9d And he went straight to where his father-in-law\r\nwas sitting in the parlour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKalamake,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI want a concertina.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, indeed?\xe2\x80\x9d said Kalamake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand I may as well tell you plainly, I mean to have it.\r\nA man who picks up dollars on the beach can certainly afford a\r\nconcertina.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no idea you had so much spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sorcerer. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought you were a timid, useless lad, and I cannot describe how much\r\npleased I am to find I was mistaken. Now I begin to think I may have\r\nfound an assistant and successor in my difficult business. A\r\nconcertina? You shall have the best in Honolulu. And to-night, as soon\r\nas it is dark, you and I will go and find the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we return to the beach?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Keola.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Kalamake; \xe2\x80\x9cyou must begin to learn more of my\r\nsecrets. Last time I taught you to pick shells; this time I shall teach\r\nyou to catch fish. Are you strong enough to launch Pili\xe2\x80\x99s boat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I am,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Keola. \xe2\x80\x9cBut why should we not take your own,\r\nwhich is afloat already?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a reason which you will understand thoroughly before\r\nto-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kalamake. \xe2\x80\x9cPili\xe2\x80\x99s boat is the better suited for my\r\npurpose. So, if you please, let us meet there as soon as it is dark;\r\nand in the meanwhile, let us keep our own counsel, for there is no\r\ncause to let the family into our business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHoney is not more sweet than was the voice of Kalamake, and Keola could\r\nscarce contain his satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might have had my concertina weeks ago,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, \xe2\x80\x9cand there is\r\nnothing needed in this world but a little courage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently after he spied Lehua weeping, and was half in a mind to tell\r\nher all was well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut no,\xe2\x80\x9d thinks he; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall wait till I can show her the concertina;\r\nwe shall see what the chit will do then. Perhaps she will understand in\r\nthe future that her husband is a man of some intelligence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was dark father and son-in-law launched Pili\xe2\x80\x99s boat and\r\nset the sail. There was a great sea, and it blew strong from the\r\nleeward; but the boat was swift and light and dry, and skimmed the\r\nwaves. The wizard had a lantern, which he lit and held with his finger\r\nthrough the ring; and the two sat in the stern and smoked cigars, of\r\nwhich Kalamake had always a provision, and spoke like friends of magic\r\nand the great sums of money which they could make by its exercise, and\r\nwhat they should buy first, and what second; and Kalamake talked like a\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nPresently he looked all about, and above him at the stars, and back at\r\nthe island, which was already three parts sunk under the sea, and he\r\nseemed to consider ripely his position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook!\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is Molokai already far behind us, and Maui like\r\na cloud; and by the bearing of these three stars I know I am come where\r\nI desire. This part of the sea is called the Sea of the Dead. It is in\r\nthis place extraordinarily deep, and the floor is all covered with the\r\nbones of men, and in the holes of this part gods and goblins keep their\r\nhabitation. The flow of the sea is to the north, stronger than a shark\r\ncan swim, and any man who shall here be thrown out of a ship it bears\r\naway like a wild horse into the uttermost ocean. Presently he is spent\r\nand goes down, and his bones are scattered with the rest, and the gods\r\ndevour his spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFear came on Keola at the words, and he looked, and by the light of the\r\nstars and the lantern, the warlock seemed to change.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat ails you?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Keola, quick and sharp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not I who am ailing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the wizard; \xe2\x80\x9cbut there is one here\r\nvery sick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he changed his grasp upon the lantern, and, behold I as he\r\ndrew his finger from the ring, the finger stuck and the ring was burst,\r\nand his hand was grown to be of the bigness of three.\r\n\r\nAt that sight Keola screamed and covered his face.\r\n\r\nBut Kalamake held up the lantern. \xe2\x80\x9cLook rather at my face!\xe2\x80\x9d said he\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nhis head was huge as a barrel; and still he grew and grew as a cloud\r\ngrows on a mountain, and Keola sat before him screaming, and the boat\r\nraced on the great seas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the wizard, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you think about that concertina?\r\nand are you sure you would not rather have a flute? No?\xe2\x80\x9d says he; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nis well, for I do not like my family to be changeable of purpose. But I\r\nbegin to think I had better get out of this paltry boat, for my bulk\r\nswells to a very unusual degree, and if we are not the more careful,\r\nshe will presently be swamped.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he threw his legs over the side. Even as he did so, the\r\ngreatness of the man grew thirty-fold and forty-fold as swift as sight\r\nor thinking, so that he stood in the deep seas to the armpits, and his\r\nhead and shoulders rose like a high isle, and the swell beat and burst\r\nupon his bosom, as it beats and breaks against a cliff. The boat ran\r\nstill to the north, but he reached out his hand, and took the gunwale\r\nby the finger and thumb, and broke the side like a biscuit, and Keola\r\nwas spilled into the sea. And the pieces of the boat the sorcerer\r\ncrushed in the hollow of his hand and flung miles away into the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me taking the lantern,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have a long wade before\r\nme, and the land is far, and the bottom of the sea uneven, and I feel\r\nthe bones under my toes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he turned and went off walking with great strides; and as often as\r\nKeola sank in the trough he could see him no longer; but as often as he\r\nwas heaved upon the crest, there he was striding and dwindling, and he\r\nheld the lamp high over his head, and the waves broke white about him\r\nas he went.\r\n\r\nSince first the islands were fished out of the sea, there was never a\r\nman so terrified as this Keola. He swam indeed, but he swam as puppies\r\nswim when they are cast in to drown, and knew not wherefore. He could\r\nbut think of the hugeness of the swelling of the warlock, of that face\r\nwhich was great as a mountain, of those shoulders that were broad as an\r\nisle, and of the seas that beat on them in vain. He thought, too, of\r\nthe concertina, and shame took hold upon him; and of the dead men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbones, and fear shook him.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden he was aware of something dark against the stars that\r\ntossed, and a light below, and a brightness of the cloven sea; and he\r\nheard speech of men. He cried out aloud and a voice answered; and in a\r\ntwinkling the bows of a ship hung above him on a wave like a thing\r\nbalanced, and swooped down. He caught with his two hands in the chains\r\nof her, and the next moment was buried in the rushing seas, and the\r\nnext hauled on board by seamen.\r\n\r\nThey gave him gin and biscuit and dry clothes, and asked him how he\r\ncame where they found him, and whether the light which they had seen\r\nwas the lighthouse, Lae o Ka Laau. But Keola knew white men are like\r\nchildren and only believe their own stories; so about himself he told\r\nthem what he pleased, and as for the light (which was Kalamake\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlantern) he vowed he had seen none.\r\n\r\nThis ship was a schooner bound for Honolulu, and then to trade in the\r\nlow islands; and by a very good chance for Keola she had lost a man off\r\nthe bowsprit in a squall. It was no use talking. Keola durst not stay\r\nin the Eight Islands. Word goes so quickly, and all men are so fond to\r\ntalk and carry news, that if he hid in the north end of Kauai or in the\r\nsouth end of Kau, the wizard would have wind of it before a month, and\r\nhe must perish. So he did what seemed the most prudent, and shipped\r\nsailor in the place of the man who had been drowned.\r\n\r\nIn some ways the ship was a good place. The food was extraordinarily\r\nrich and plenty, with biscuits and salt beef every day, and pea-soup\r\nand puddings made of flour and suet twice a week, so that Keola grew\r\nfat. The captain also was a good man, and the crew no worse than other\r\nwhites. The trouble was the mate, who was the most difficult man to\r\nplease Keola had ever met with, and beat and cursed him daily, both for\r\nwhat he did and what he did not. The blows that he dealt were very\r\nsore, for he was strong; and the words he used were very unpalatable,\r\nfor Keola was come of a good family and accustomed to respect. And what\r\nwas the worst of all, whenever Keola found a chance to sleep, there was\r\nthe mate awake and stirring him up with a rope\xe2\x80\x99s end. Keola saw it\r\nwould never do; and he made up his mind to run away.\r\n\r\nThey were about a month out from Honolulu when they made the land. It\r\nwas a fine starry night, the sea was smooth as well as the sky fair; it\r\nblew a steady trade; and there was the island on their weather bow, a\r\nribbon of palm trees lying flat along the sea. The captain and the mate\r\nlooked at it with the night glass, and named the name of it, and talked\r\nof it, beside the wheel where Keola was steering. It seemed it was an\r\nisle where no traders came. By the captain\xe2\x80\x99s way, it was an isle\r\nbesides where no man dwelt; but the mate thought otherwise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t give a cent for the directory,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been past here\r\none night in the schooner _Eugenie_; it was just such a night as this;\r\nthey were fishing with torches, and the beach was thick with lights\r\nlike a town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d says the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cits steep-to, that\xe2\x80\x99s the great point;\r\nand there ain\xe2\x80\x99t any outlying dangers by the chart, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll just hug\r\nthe lee side of it. Keep her romping full, don\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried\r\nto Keola, who was listening so hard that he forgot to steer.\r\n\r\nAnd the mate cursed him, and swore that Kanaka was for no use in the\r\nworld, and if he got started after him with a belaying pin, it would be\r\na cold day for Keola.\r\n\r\nAnd so the captain and mate lay down on the house together, and Keola\r\nwas left to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis island will do very well for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought; \xe2\x80\x9cif no traders deal\r\nthere, the mate will never come. And as for Kalamake, it is not\r\npossible he can ever get as far as this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he kept edging the schooner nearer in. He had to do this\r\nquietly, for it was the trouble with these white men, and above all\r\nwith the mate, that you could never be sure of them; they would all be\r\nsleeping sound, or else pretending, and if a sail shook, they would\r\njump to their feet and fall on you with a rope\xe2\x80\x99s end. So Keola edged\r\nher up little by little, and kept all drawing. And presently the land\r\nwas close on board, and the sound of the sea on the sides of it grew\r\nloud.\r\n\r\nWith that, the mate sat up suddenly upon the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d he roars. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have the ship ashore!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he made one bound for Keola, and Keola made another clean over the\r\nrail and plump into the starry sea. When he came up again, the schooner\r\nhad payed off on her true course, and the mate stood by the wheel\r\nhimself, and Keola heard him cursing. The sea was smooth under the lee\r\nof the island; it was warm besides, and Keola had his sailor\xe2\x80\x99s knife,\r\nso he had no fear of sharks. A little way before him the trees stopped;\r\nthere was a break in the line of the land like the mouth of a harbour;\r\nand the tide, which was then flowing, took him up and carried him\r\nthrough. One minute he was without, and the next within: had floated\r\nthere in a wide shallow water, bright with ten thousand stars, and all\r\nabout him was the ring of the land, with its string of palm trees. And\r\nhe was amazed, because this was a kind of island he had never heard of.\r\n\r\nThe time of Keola in that place was in two periods\xe2\x80\x94the period when he\r\nwas alone, and the period when he was there with the tribe. At first he\r\nsought everywhere and found no man; only some houses standing in a\r\nhamlet, and the marks of fires. But the ashes of the fires were cold\r\nand the rains had washed them away; and the winds had blown, and some\r\nof the huts were overthrown. It was here he took his dwelling, and he\r\nmade a fire drill, and a shell hook, and fished and cooked his fish,\r\nand climbed after green cocoanuts, the juice of which he drank, for in\r\nall the isle there was no water. The days were long to him, and the\r\nnights terrifying. He made a lamp of cocoa-shell, and drew the oil of\r\nthe ripe nuts, and made a wick of fibre; and when evening came he\r\nclosed up his hut, and lit his lamp, and lay and trembled till morning.\r\nMany a time he thought in his heart he would have been better in the\r\nbottom of the sea, his bones rolling there with the others.\r\n\r\nAll this while he kept by the inside of the island, for the huts were\r\non the shore of the lagoon, and it was there the palms grew best, and\r\nthe lagoon itself abounded with good fish. And to the outer slide he\r\nwent once only, and he looked but the once at the beach of the ocean,\r\nand came away shaking. For the look of it, with its bright sand, and\r\nstrewn shells, and strong sun and surf, went sore against his\r\ninclination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot be,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cand yet it is very like. And how do I\r\nknow? These white men, although they pretend to know where they are\r\nsailing, must take their chance like other people. So that after all we\r\nmay have sailed in a circle, and I may be quite near to Molokai, and\r\nthis may be the very beach where my father-in-law gathers his dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo after that he was prudent, and kept to the land side.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps a month later, when the people of the place arrived\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nfill of six great boats. They were a fine race of men, and spoke a\r\ntongue that sounded very different from the tongue of Hawaii, but so\r\nmany of the words were the same that it was not difficult to\r\nunderstand. The men besides were very courteous, and the women very\r\ntowardly; and they made Keola welcome, and built him a house, and gave\r\nhim a wife; and what surprised him the most, he was never sent to work\r\nwith the young men.\r\n\r\nAnd now Keola had three periods. First he had a period of being very\r\nsad, and then he had a period when he was pretty merry. Last of all\r\ncame the third, when he was the most terrified man in the four oceans.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the first period was the girl he had to wife. He was in\r\ndoubt about the island, and he might have been in doubt about the\r\nspeech, of which he had heard so little when he came there with the\r\nwizard on the mat. But about his wife there was no mistake conceivable,\r\nfor she was the same girl that ran from him crying in the wood. So he\r\nhad sailed all this way, and might as well have stayed in Molokai; and\r\nhad left home and wife and all his friends for no other cause but to\r\nescape his enemy, and the place he had come to was that wizard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhunting ground, and the shore where he walked invisible. It was at this\r\nperiod when he kept the most close to the lagoon side, and as far as he\r\ndared, abode in the cover of his hut.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the second period was talk he heard from his wife and the\r\nchief islanders. Keola himself said little. He was never so sure of his\r\nnew friends, for he judged they were too civil to be wholesome, and\r\nsince he had grown better acquainted with his father-in-law the man had\r\ngrown more cautious. So he told them nothing of himself, but only his\r\nname and descent, and that he came from the Eight Islands, and what\r\nfine islands they were; and about the king\xe2\x80\x99s palace in Honolulu, and\r\nhow he was a chief friend of the king and the missionaries. But he put\r\nmany questions and learned much. The island where he was was called the\r\nIsle of Voices; it belonged to the tribe, but they made their home upon\r\nanother, three hours\xe2\x80\x99 sail to the southward. There they lived and had\r\ntheir permanent houses, and it was a rich island, where were eggs and\r\nchickens and pigs, and ships came trading with rum and tobacco. It was\r\nthere the schooner had gone after Keola deserted; there, too, the mate\r\nhad died, like the fool of a white man as he was. It seems, when the\r\nship came, it was the beginning of the sickly season in that isle, when\r\nthe fish of the lagoon are poisonous, and all who eat of them swell up\r\nand die. The mate was told of it; he saw the boats preparing, because\r\nin that season the people leave that island and sail to the Isle of\r\nVoices; but he was a fool of a white man, who would believe no stories\r\nbut his own, and he caught one of these fish, cooked it and ate it, and\r\nswelled up and died, which was good news to Keola. As for the Isle of\r\nVoices, it lay solitary the most part of the year; only now and then a\r\nboat\xe2\x80\x99s crew came for copra, and in the bad season, when the fish at the\r\nmain isle were poisonous, the tribe dwelt there in a body. It had its\r\nname from a marvel, for it seemed the seaside of it was all beset with\r\ninvisible devils; day and night you heard them talking one with another\r\nin strange tongues; day and night little fires blazed up and were\r\nextinguished on the beach; and what was the cause of these doings no\r\nman might conceive. Keola asked them if it were the same in their own\r\nisland where they stayed, and they told him no, not there; nor yet in\r\nany other of some hundred isles that lay all about them in that sea;\r\nbut it was a thing peculiar to the Isle of Voices. They told him also\r\nthat these fires and voices were ever on the seaside and in the seaward\r\nfringes of the wood, and a man might dwell by the lagoon two thousand\r\nyears (if he could live so long) and never be any way troubled; and\r\neven on the seaside the devils did no harm if let alone. Only once a\r\nchief had cast a spear at one of the voices, and the same night he fell\r\nout of a cocoanut palm and was killed.\r\n\r\nKeola thought a good bit with himself. He saw he would be all right\r\nwhen the tribe returned to the main island, and right enough where he\r\nwas, if he kept by the lagoon, yet he had a mind to make things righter\r\nif he could. So he told the high chief he had once been in an isle that\r\nwas pestered the same way, and the folk had found a means to cure that\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a tree growing in the bush there,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cand it seems\r\nthese devils came to get the leaves of it. So the people of the isle\r\ncut down the tree wherever it was found, and the devils came no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey asked what kind of tree this was, and he showed them the tree of\r\nwhich Kalamake burned the leaves. They found it hard to believe, yet\r\nthe idea tickled them. Night after night the old men debated it in\r\ntheir councils, but the high chief (though he was a brave man) was\r\nafraid of the matter, and reminded them daily of the chief who cast a\r\nspear against the voices and was killed, and the thought of that\r\nbrought all to a stand again.\r\n\r\nThough he could not yet bring about the destruction of the trees, Keola\r\nwas well enough pleased, and began to look about him and take pleasure\r\nin his days; and, among other things, he was the kinder to his wife, so\r\nthat the girl began to love him greatly. One day he came to the hut,\r\nand she lay on the ground lamenting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keola, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is wrong with you now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe declared it was nothing.\r\n\r\nThe same night she woke him. The lamp burned very low, but he saw by\r\nher face she was in sorrow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeola,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cput your ear to my mouth that I may whisper, for no\r\none must hear us. Two days before the boats begin to be got ready, go\r\nyou to the sea-side of the isle and lie in a thicket. We shall choose\r\nthat place before-hand, you and I; and hide food; and every night I\r\nshall come near by there singing. So when a night comes and you do not\r\nhear me, you shall know we are clean gone out of the island, and you\r\nmay come forth again in safety.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soul of Keola died within him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot live among devils. I will not be\r\nleft behind upon this isle. I am dying to leave it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will never leave it alive, my poor Keola,\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl; \xe2\x80\x9cfor to\r\ntell you the truth, my people are eaters of men; but this they keep\r\nsecret. And the reason they will kill you before we leave is because in\r\nour island ships come, and Donat-Kimaran comes and talks for the\r\nFrench, and there is a white trader there in a house with a verandah,\r\nand a catechist. Oh, that is a fine place indeed! The trader has\r\nbarrels filled with flour, and a French warship once came in the lagoon\r\nand gave everybody wine and biscuit. Ah, my poor Keola, I wish I could\r\ntake you there, for great is my love to you, and it is the finest place\r\nin the seas except Papeete.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo now Keola was the most terrified man in the four oceans. He had\r\nheard tell of eaters of men in the south islands, and the thing had\r\nalways been a fear to him; and here it was knocking at his door. He had\r\nheard besides, by travellers, of their practices, and how when they are\r\nin a mind to eat a man, they cherish and fondle him like a mother with\r\na favourite baby. And he saw this must be his own case; and that was\r\nwhy he had been housed, and fed, and wived, and liberated from all\r\nwork; and why the old men and the chiefs discoursed with him like a\r\nperson of weight. So he lay on his bed and railed upon his destiny; and\r\nthe flesh curdled on his bones.\r\n\r\nThe next day the people of the tribe were very civil, as their way was.\r\nThey were elegant speakers, and they made beautiful poetry, and jested\r\nat meals, so that a missionary must have died laughing. It was little\r\nenough Keola cared for their fine ways; all he saw was the white teeth\r\nshining in their mouths, and his gorge rose at the sight; and when they\r\nwere done eating, he went and lay in the bush like a dead man.\r\n\r\nThe next day it was the same, and then his wife followed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeola,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cif you do not eat, I tell you plainly you will be\r\nkilled and cooked to-morrow. Some of the old chiefs are murmuring\r\nalready. They think you are fallen sick and must lose flesh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that Keola got to his feet, and anger burned in him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is little I care one way or the other,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI am between the\r\ndevil and the deep sea. Since die I must, let me die the quickest way;\r\nand since I must be eaten at the best of it, let me rather be eaten by\r\nhobgoblins than by men. Farewell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and he left her standing,\r\nand walked to the sea-side of that island.\r\n\r\nIt was all bare in the strong sun; there was no sign of man, only the\r\nbeach was trodden, and all about him as he went, the voices talked and\r\nwhispered, and the little fires sprang up and burned down. All tongues\r\nof the earth were spoken there; the French, the Dutch, the Russian, the\r\nTamil, the Chinese. Whatever land knew sorcery, there were some of its\r\npeople whispering in Keola\xe2\x80\x99s ear. That beach was thick as a cried fair,\r\nyet no man seen; and as he walked he saw the shells vanish before him,\r\nand no man to pick them up. I think the devil would have been afraid to\r\nbe alone in such a company; but Keola was past fear and courted death.\r\nWhen the fires sprang up, he charged for them like a bull. Bodiless\r\nvoices called to and fro; unseen hands poured sand upon the flames; and\r\nthey were gone from the beach before he reached them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is plain Kalamake is not here,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cor I must have been\r\nkilled long since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that he sat him down in the margin of the wood, for he was tired,\r\nand put his chin upon his hands. The business before his eyes\r\ncontinued: the beach babbled with voices, and the fires sprang up and\r\nsank, and the shells vanished and were renewed again even while he\r\nlooked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a by-day when I was here before,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it was\r\nnothing to this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd his head was dizzy with the thought of these millions and millions\r\nof dollars, and all these hundreds and hundreds of persons culling them\r\nupon the beach and flying in the air higher and swifter than eagles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to think how they have fooled me with their talk of mints,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x9cand that money was made there, when it is clear that all the new\r\ncoin in all the world is gathered on these sands! But I will know\r\nbetter the next time!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nAnd at last, he knew not very well how or when, sleep feel on Keola,\r\nand he forgot the island and all his sorrows.\r\n\r\nEarly the next day, before the sun was yet up, a bustle woke him. He\r\nawoke in fear, for he thought the tribe had caught him napping: but it\r\nwas no such matter. Only, on the beach in front of him, the bodiless\r\nvoices called and shouted one upon another, and it seemed they all\r\npassed and swept beside him up the coast of the island.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is afoot now?\xe2\x80\x9d thinks Keola. And it was plain to him it was\r\nsomething beyond ordinary, for the fires were not lighted nor the\r\nshells taken, but the bodiless voices kept posting up the beach, and\r\nhailing and dying away; and others following, and by the sound of them\r\nthese wizards should be angry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not me they are angry at,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Keola, \xe2\x80\x9cfor they pass me\r\nclose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs when hounds go by, or horses in a race, or city folk coursing to a\r\nfire, and all men join and follow after, so it was now with Keola; and\r\nhe knew not what he did, nor why he did it, but there, lo and behold!\r\nhe was running with the voices.\r\n\r\nSo he turned one point of the island, and this brought him in view of a\r\nsecond; and there he remembered the wizard trees to have been growing\r\nby the score together in a wood. From this point there went up a hubbub\r\nof men crying not to be described; and by the sound of them, those that\r\nhe ran with shaped their course for the same quarter. A little nearer,\r\nand there began to mingle with the outcry the crash of many axes. And\r\nat this a thought came at last into his mind that the high chief had\r\nconsented; that the men of the tribe had set-to cutting down these\r\ntrees; that word had gone about the isle from sorcerer to sorcerer, and\r\nthese were all now assembling to defend their trees. Desire of strange\r\nthings swept him on. He posted with the voices, crossed the beach, and\r\ncame into the borders of the wood, and stood astonished. One tree had\r\nfallen, others were part hewed away. There was the tribe clustered.\r\nThey were back to back, and bodies lay, and blood flowed among their\r\nfeet. The hue of fear was on all their faces; their voices went up to\r\nheaven shrill as a weasel\xe2\x80\x99s cry.\r\n\r\nHave you seen a child when he is all alone and has a wooden sword, and\r\nfights, leaping and hewing with the empty air? Even so the man-eaters\r\nhuddled back to back, and heaved up their axes, and laid on, and\r\nscreamed as they laid on, and behold! no man to contend with them! only\r\nhere and there Keola saw an axe swinging over against them without\r\nhands; and time and again a man of the tribe would fall before it,\r\nclove in twain or burst asunder, and his soul sped howling.\r\n\r\nFor awhile Keola looked upon this prodigy like one that dreams, and\r\nthen fear took him by the midst as sharp as death, that he should\r\nbehold such doings. Even in that same flash the high chief of the clan\r\nespied him standing, and pointed and called out his name. Thereat the\r\nwhole tribe saw him also, and their eyes flashed, and their teeth\r\nclashed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am too long here,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Keola, and ran further out of the wood\r\nand down the beach, not caring whither.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeola!\xe2\x80\x9d said, a voice close by upon the empty sand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLehua! is that you?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, and gasped, and looked in vain for her;\r\nbut by the eyesight he was stark alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw you pass before,\xe2\x80\x9d the voice answered: \xe2\x80\x9cbut you would not hear\r\nme. Quick! get the leaves and the herbs, and let us free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are there with the mat?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, at your side;\xe2\x80\x9d said she. And he felt her arms about him. \xe2\x80\x9cQuick!\r\nthe leaves and the herbs, before my father can get back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Keola ran for his life, and fetched the wizard fuel; and Lehua\r\nguided him back, and set his feet upon the mat, and made the fire. All\r\nthe time of its burning, the sound of the battle towered out of the\r\nwood; the wizards and the man-eaters hard at fight; the wizards, the\r\nviewless ones, roaring out aloud like bulls upon a mountain, and the\r\nmen of the tribe replying shrill and savage out of the terror of their\r\nsouls. And all the time of the burning, Keola stood there and listened,\r\nand shook, and watched how the unseen hands of Lehua poured the leaves.\r\nShe poured them fast, and the flame burned high, and scorched Keola\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands; and she speeded and blew the burning with her breath. The last\r\nleaf was eaten, the flame fell, and the shock followed, and there were\r\nKeola and Lehua in the room at home.\r\n\r\nNow, when Keola could see his wife at last he was mighty pleased, and\r\nhe was mighty pleased to be home again in Molokai and sit down beside a\r\nbowl of poi\xe2\x80\x94for they make no poi on board ships, and there was none in\r\nthe Isle of Voices\xe2\x80\x94and he was out of the body with pleasure to be clean\r\nescaped out of the hands of the eaters of men. But there was another\r\nmatter not so clear, and Lehua and Keola talked of it all night and\r\nwere troubled. There was Kalamake left upon the isle. If, by the\r\nblessing of God, he could but stick there, all were well; but should he\r\nescape and return to Molokai, it would be an ill day for his daughter\r\nand her husband. They spoke of his gift of swelling, and whether he\r\ncould wade that distance in the seas. But Keola knew by this time where\r\nthat island was\xe2\x80\x94and that is to say, in the Low or Dangerous\r\nArchipelago. So they fetched the atlas and looked upon the distance in\r\nthe map, and by what they could make of it, it seemed a far way for an\r\nold gentleman to walk. Still, it would not do to make too sure of a\r\nwarlock like Kalamake, and they determined at last to take counsel of a\r\nwhite missionary.\r\n\r\nSo the first one that came by, Keola told him everything. And the\r\nmissionary was very sharp on him for taking the second wife in the low\r\nisland; but for all the rest, he vowed he could make neither head nor\r\ntail of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\xe2\x80\x9d says he, \xe2\x80\x9cif you think this money of your father\xe2\x80\x99s ill\r\ngotten, my advice to you would be, give some of it to the lepers and\r\nsome to the missionary fund. And as for this extraordinary rigmarole,\r\nyou cannot do better than keep it to yourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he warned the police at Honolulu that, by all he could make out,\r\nKalamake and Keola had been coining false money, and it would not be\r\namiss to watch them.\r\n\r\nKeola and Lehua took his advice, and gave many dollars to the lepers\r\nand the fund. And no doubt the advice must have been good, for from\r\nthat day to this, Kalamake has never more been heard of. But whether he\r\nwas slain in the battle by the trees, or whether he is still kicking\r\nhis heels upon the Isle of Voices, who shall say?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Please pronounce _pappa_ throughout.\r\n\r\n[2] Alas!\r\n\r\n[3] Aeolian\r\n\r\n[4] Yes.\r\n\r\n[5] Leprosy.\r\n\r\n[6] Whites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ISLAND NIGHTS\xe2\x80\x99 ENTERTAINMENTS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 329-0.txt or 329-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/329/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
